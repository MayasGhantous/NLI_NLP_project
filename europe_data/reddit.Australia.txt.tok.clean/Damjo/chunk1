i had neither of those definitions in mind . 
  mate , what are you talking about ? 
  ^ ^ ^ did ^ ^ ^ someone ^ ^ ^ mention ^ ^ ^ australia ? 
  kein problem . 
  the dream is to make a permanent move to germany . 
  however , there are so many amazing places and people all over europe , i think in the end i really just want to find a place i can settle in , work on my career and making a meaningful contribution to the society . 
  so he 's carrying a knife because ... ? 
  what absolute rubbish . 
  everyone is to be held responsible for their actions all the time . 
  it 's called ** being an adult ** . 
  and no country should be obliged to take in an immigrant/refugee who is prepare to use violence to get their way . 
  that 's not on . 
  [ perhaps ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2itjv68oycy ), 
  it 's good . 
  for me , all your women are downside up . 
  what level are you ? 
  need a penpal ? 
  i 'm waiting for the day i finally pack my bags and make the journey to europe . 
  [ and just for them feels ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1bfr2swp1i ), 
  the poor thing just wants to be understood .

  [ new zealand ] ( http://imgur.com/xkx1fq2 ) and [ romania ] ( http://imgur.com/a/gd2oc ) deserve a mention for having polymer . 
  i do n't think many people are aware of this . 
  also , polymer makes tipping strippers far more sanitary . 
  and sexy eestis . 
  hubba hubba . 
  just ... fuck , god no , please . 
  that 's so stupid . 
  he 's canadian and part of the commonwealth . 
  why should that cost an arm and a leg ? 
  fuck , they even have the queen on their [ bank notes ] ( http://rter.info/image.php?iso=cad&amp;name=4-de913389f9bc923d7e4425343e38b83e ) .

  anecdotal evidence suggests that second gen immigrants have a stronger tendency to become more nationalistic and aggressive/extreme than their migrant parents , who made the decision to move to the host country . 
  i would put this down to an identity crisis that those second gens face , similar to the experiences you mentioned you 're having ( not that i 'm trying to deduce that you 're an extremist ) . 
  it 's a quirky situation where you feel you usually have to pick what side of the fence you are on , i.e. 
  `` i am more x than y '' whereas you should be looking at yourself and saying `` i am the best of both worlds '' . 
  why not cherry-pick and market yourself accordingly ? 
  forget the others , you 've yourself to worry about . 
  side note : i 'm second gen in kangarooland . 
  who needs language when you 're in the country of s ** love ** nia ?

  i once told a buddhist monk about it at a temple stay in korea . 
  he told me how lovely our ski slopes are and such beautiful mountains we have . 
  after trying to correct him three times i just gave up and put on my best schwarzenegger accent . 
  he was a nice old man too , so cool . 
  my slovenian friends would ask me what it 's like living with dangerous animals . 
  it 's really not so bad once you learn to stand on your hind legs , hiss loudly and thump your chest to assert your dominance . 
  ahh crap , yeah that 's right . 
  then it must have been the demonym for the two of them . 
  i guess all that drinking really did mess up my memory . 
  it was great , thanks for asking . 
  i studied in slovenia for a year . 
  no matter how many times i told people back home , they would always ask me `` so how is it in bratislava ? '', 
  they were so excited to think they finally knew some geography until i had to point out to them the difference . 
  it does n't help that the two both called their language `` slovenska '', 
   australia ... ivf this has never come up in conversation , not even once . 
  haha , new zealand though ... 
  if they ca n't into nordic , we will take her . 
  she 's so cute . 
  not like our silly , smelly new zealand . 
  considering that it may be used by isis , i do n't think we have cause for concern . 
  in fact , let 's just inconvenience them with council bills and `` accidentally '' disconnect their utilities . 
  that 'll teach them . 
  to be fair eesti is pretty damn cute , it 's hard not to, 
  just so i understand clearly , this is meant to show how 100,000 + pop cities are clustered togethered ? 
  how they are linked ? 
  either it 's not straight forward or i 'm not switched on for a friday afternoon,

  i am printing these out and posting them on every wall in our office . 
  haha , brilliant . 
  he reminds me of our very own [ racist , loud-mouthed grandpa mp ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/wilson_tuckey ) . 
  he 's no longer in parliament . 
  there 's just something about old men that really sets them on a different projectory at that age . 
  it 's like they mentally expire way before they do so physically . 
   paavo only plays for team paavo ... 
  i do n't know why but i love this line . 
  please tell me this is his campaign slogan . 
  it 's a great idea and i love the presentation . 
  as you know , it 's far too difficult to dissect the balkans in any manner but gn gives you a. . . `` basic '' picture of who 's who and what 's what at least . 
  `` if being sexy was a crime , you 'd be guilty as charged . 
  i 'd love you to frisk me . 
  what are you doing with your night stick later ? 
  are you a parking ticket ?

  kiev , here i come . 
  greece really has nothing to worry about regarding historic claims or territorial ambitions . 
  when greece puts so much emphasis on this by blockading or vetoing macedonia , it 's only bound to agitate macedonians who will , in turn , convert their capital into a disneyland of victory arches and name monuments after alex all just to spite greece . 
  it 's like watching two brothers fighting without mum or dad around to lay down the law . 
  it just turns into a loud shouting match . 
  from my point of view , in the macedonian diaspora here it was a bit more than just a ` niche ' , rather a strong undertone . 
  admittedly though , it seems like things really started blowing out of proportion when gruevski came in . 
  there 's something about migrating that just fires up a migrant 's national pride . 
  on my visits back to the motherland , greece just was n't a discussion topic at the dinner table . 
  haha , oh yeah i completely forgot about this . 
  tourists were sizzling by the dozens at the beach . 
  holy shit , ukraine !, 
  really ? 
  was it like this before the russians too ? 
  dae remember putin 's policy on this ?
