  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftteivfqz-g ) putin is going to lose his shit ... 
  this is going to be great . 
  actually , i 've noticed this is very common amongst germans too . 
  always , a ` video ' gets pronounced as ` wideo ' and i do n't understand how that works . 
  i thought german ` v ' is pronounced like an ` f ' . 
  what happened to ` fideos ' ? 
  i feel i more closely aligned with the german than the australian after reading this . 
  had a good chuckle , as this happens to virtually all my mates . 
  well , which part ? 
  a tad out of date , so it may not answer your question but i found [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8xaxjx9wj8 ) pretty helpful, 
  procreate for patriotism . 
  yes , i like this idea . 
  i 'm not sure ... 
  but i think he was kidding . 
  he was kidding , right ? 
  i 'd start off in [ preseren square ] ( http://www.worldofwanderlust.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/img_2178.jpg ) and then go for a bit of a walk along ljubljanica . 
  lots of great cafes and bars along the river . 
  i still remember pr ` skelet was one of my favourites where they had a * huge * cocktail range . 
  the [ castle on top of the hill ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4e/ljubljana_castle_%289a%29.jpg ) gives a great view of the city . 
  at night , [ metelkova ] ( http://www.metelkovamesto.org/img/admin/m_foto/fotke/dcam0709.jpg ) has that bohemian vibe going for it . 
  huge student population , and if it has n't changed since i was there , the big nights to go out are actually during the week rather than the weekend ( since the local students all head home for sat/sun ) . 
  it 's been a while but there 's a lot to check out in lj . 
  as a tourist , i do n't think you 'd need more than a few days though , it 's a city of 300,000 and all the action is walking distance from the main square . 
  that 's exactly right . 
  it was n't . 
  i did n't think op was asking specifically about those under ussr 's influence when they said `` behind the iron curtain . '', 
  but i threw in yugoslavia anyway because it 's a bit of a mixed bag in my opinion . 
  i figured , since it was still ... and i know i 'm going to upset a few people here ... `` communist/socialist '' , it still hit op 's criteria . 
  you never would have guessed it if you visited there . 
  would also vouch for tallinn and zagreb . 
  there are plenty of places but these are in my opinion the lesser known/often overlooked which are worth a mention . 
  i 'm no economist but by having an aging population you put pressure on the younger generation to work harder to maintain the benefits at status quo , also you have more retirees adding strain to the healthcare and pension systems . 
  actually , australia is having a similar problem - and they 're waging that there wo n't be a retirement age for gen ys when they reach the `` end '' of their working life . 
  my turkish friends resent me for using that phrase . 
  it was either that or remove erdogan . 
  you sound just like my old slovenian roommate . 
  third ? 
  would n't that make it fourth ? 
   ... you are being silly to say that each war supported by australia was ** independently ** in its interests . 
  i never said that nor did i imply it . 
  my point was that we did not just blindly follow the us into the war for shits and giggles . 
  exactly as you said , we were * furthering * our interests . 
   amazing that you think ** the problem with vietnam was that the us/s . 
  vietnam did n't win ** . 
  history supports that it was a unnecessary war . 
  never said that either . 
  i 'm saying that the american handling of the war was poor . 
  whether it was winnable or not is a different story . 
   ... you seem ignorant of the continental w. european safety net and regulated labor market . 
  australia has both but not to the same degree . 
  you go from talking about social contracts to honing in on labour markets . 
  what are you actually trying to say ? 
  you have n't made any point here . 
  also i do n't know why you 've chosen to say that since i did n't actually discuss our labour market . 
   ... very few countries were foolish enough to join the us ... 
  i told you why australia joined in vietnam . 
  i 'm not going to repeat myself . 
  i will however point out that the real fiasco was letting the us spearhead operations given it had virtually zero experience in jungle/guerrilla warfare and , in a trademark us fashion , gauged the enemy in reckless combat with no long-term strategy . 
  at least the australians were a bit more tactful in their approach . 
   australia would probably have further to travel to approach continental style social contract then it would the us . 
  wow ... baltimore ? 
  i think we 'll pass on the * freedom a la americana * . 
  ok , i 'm not sure what your point is exactly but you sound a little irate in my opinion . 
   australia joined the us in the * fucking vietnam war . 
  * yes , we were in the vietnam war . 
  unlike the us , we are within proximity to south-east asia . 
  the fear of communism spreading to our close neighbours and eventually spill over onto our shores was very real and threatening at the time . 
  what 's your point ? 
   australia would sooner be a us protectorate . 
  if you tighten your gun laws , introduce universal healthcare , make tertiary education affordable , double your minimum wages , improve social welfare benefits , remove capital punishment , adopt the metric system , drive on the left hand side of the road , colour your bank notes , change your coat-of-arms to native us fauna you can legally eat , switch to british english spelling standards , say `` petrol '' instead of `` gas '' , stop brewing that toilet backwash you insist on calling `` beer '' and compete in eurovision as an anniversary guest we 'll think about it . 
  alright , calm down mate . 
  not with that gloomy attitude . 
  you know ... if uk wants to leave eu , we 'd love to take their place . 
  letting eu countries opt for fines wont lead to a more stable , harmonised eu . 
  if anything it 'll further disintegrate . 
  we competed in eurovision . 
  our island is on the other side of the bloody planet . 
  fuck the haters . 
  and it works for us . 
  yeah , bad move in general . 
  libya under gaddafi was n't worse off than today . 
  as for the maghreb countries ... eh . 
  i 'm not versed on what 's going on over there so i wo n't comment but i also would n't think they 'd care much if the odd boat slipped past the coast once in a while . 
  even more often than we 'd like . 
  of course . 
  i 'm not trying to say they 're completely absent or impossible . 
  but when there 's a civil war occurring in that state it 's difficult to adjust terms or extend agreements for a fluid problem . 
  intervening at the `` hotspots '' would be imposing on the borders of african states , no ? 
  meaning that there 's not much you can do unless it 's in international waters . 
  and it 's not like they really have a stable government that you can undertake negotiations with ( taking libya as the prime example ) . 
  well you kinda answered your own question here . 
  do you think * all * the manual labour done in the workplace needs a c2 grasp of the language ? 
  i would tell you that `` no , there is n't freedom of speech '' but it 's not for me to comment ; partly because i 'm not trying to get into a debate about it and also because my previous comment is just me trying to paraphrase the excuse they would use . 
  i do n't really care to argue if it 's a good excuse or not but it is a point about free speech . 
  if you ca n't slander , criticise or ridicule someone for fear of being prosecuted under law - is that still freedom of speech ? 
  tl ; dr : freedom of speech . 
  just hope it 's not news followed up by `` suspects released after no significant evidence . '', 
  although , that would still be preferable over `` no evidence found '' * and then * `` terrorist suspects behind new attack was previously detained and known to authorities . '', 
  that 's right . 
  scandinavia = norway , sweden & denmark .
