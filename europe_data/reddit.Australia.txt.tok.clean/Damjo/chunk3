  the answer to why eesti will never be nordic . 
  ( i 'm sorry , i could n't resist ) . 
  it started with `` a , '' do n't beat yourself up over it , you did good . 
  [ this might explain it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo71-n3ogqq#t=4m48s ), 
  you 're right . 
  i take that back . 
  you have * zero * dignity . 
  now you 're just a buffoon with a keyboard . 
  that 's right . 
  suck it up and back away while you 've still got any dignity left . 
  how is that lying ? 
  i never denied being macedonian . 
  the thread title * did * lure me here . 
  i still find that thread and this thread hilarious and petty . 
  petty like you . 
  so you * can * comprehend pettiness - you 're not just retarded . 
  the next step is to do some self-reflection and realise how much it applies to * your * side of the fence . 
  that would be great , mate . 
   lol if nobody gives a shit what are you doing in this thread ? 
  thread title and eu 's migrant crisis led me here . 
  are you going to tell me i 'm not permitted to be informed now ? 
   we have excellent relations with albania and bulgaria . 
  and your relations with turkey ... not so much . 
  trying to steal coffee and cyprus from them , for example . 
   you see they are stealing from all of the neighbors . 
  not really . 
  they 're just trying to establish themselves after coming late to the party . 
  greece is just petty enough to let something like a name get in the way of good relations with macedonia . 
  it shows how petty greece is . 
   so if you wan na call someone `` petty '' call them that . 
  petty thieves are even better . 
  and these sentences are just propagating my point exactly . 
  you are being petty . 
  and you 're absolutely right . 
   ... it 's also about the democracy standards , rule of law , fighting the corruption and so on . 
  i 'm pretty sure that if the west did n't use nato and eu membership as a carrot and stick for the former soviet bloc in the 90s , the transformation process woud have never been as succesful as it was . 
  well , there was only so much i thought of on the spot and i was n't about to jump into an exhaustive list but of course , all of this needs to be the * primary * focus . 
  macedonians are under the impression that all their problems will be magically fixed only after they join . 
  that would be the wrong attitude to have . 
   the institutions and judicial system are not developed enought to fight corruption or other abuses of power . 
  without the pressure from abroad , there is a big risk that local politicians will go authoritarian . 
  under gruevski , it pretty much did ( albeit a pretty half-assed one ) . 
  especially in a region where self-assertion through nationalistic tendencies is very common in a very crowded part of the continent , it starts to venture down that path . 
   but without this leverage , the west has little chance to support the pro-democracy forces in macedonia . 
  and without that , it will be pretty difficult for macedonians to turn their country into a better place . 
  something has to give . 
  i just do n't think macedonia should be holding its breath to make changes . 
  you 're not defending it from liars and thieves , you 're just showcasing to the world you 're just as petty as the rest of the neighbourhood there . 
  nobody really gives a shit on the naming issue besides greece and macedonia because it affects ** no one else ** . 
  blockades and vetoing the way they have just go to prove greece is n't someone to take seriously . 
  liars and thieves . 
  pfft . 
  i suppose the greek bureaucracy is squeaky clean , too . 
  i know the extent of macedonian propaganda . 
  i do n't agree with it . 
  and i do n't agree with greek rhetoric either . 
  the point i was aiming at was that greece has nothing at risk . 
  if it were territorial ambitions or genocide , i 'd sympathise . 
  by the way , the `` united macedonia '' is not a credible risk . 
  macedonia is n't russia about to annexing a region twice its size . 
  [ not like it 's a new thing . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/megali_idea ) it 's [ quite the trend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_irredentist_claims_or_disputes#balkans ) in the balkans actually . 
  what are you defending it from ? 
   and adding `` north '' would not even be a complete change , it would just be another word and you would still be able to keep the word `` macedonia '' it 's more about the principle . 
  i do n't believe in macedonia 's territorial ambitions , claiming direct descendancy from ancient macedonians or it 's ridiculous monument erecting spree . 
  but another country vetoing your membership into eu and nato because of the country 's name ? 
  that 's just pitiful in my view , no matter how you try to shape it . 
  it just does n't sit right with me that they should * have * to change their name because of that issue . 
   so just out of curiosity - how do you think this dispute could be solved ? 
  ** my 2 cents : ** macedonia needs to forget pressing for membership , keep it 's head down and just focus on the economy , infrastructure and education . 
  do what a government ought to be doing and govern . 
  membership will come when it comes . 
  greece needs to grow up . 
  they really have nothing at risk . 
  macedonians `` stealing their history '' is just stupid paranoia . 
  edit : by the way , i absolutely do concede that there are some fucking lunatics ** on both sides of the fence ** that think identity and pride are everything in this world . 
  painting nazi flags on billboards and shit . 
  i do n't condone that at all . 
  fuck that shit . 
  macedonia and greece are neighbours . 
  they both need to drop the fucking hatchet and start working and cooperating on projects that can improve the lives of the locals there . 
  so much bloody potential just wasted away because of stupid , * stupid * disputes . 
   but we could probably squeeze in north macedonia mmm ... 
  i 'm more of an `` independent republic of macedonia '' guy myself . 
  the more you get butthurt from them using it , the more they will use it . 
  watching macedonia and greece is like watching a pair of siblings fight over a toy . 
  such fucking childish things they get hung up on when there are other important matters . 
  edit : it seems the `` older child '' does n't want to act like the older child either . 
  if that 's the approach , maybe they 're fitting of their economic situation as well . 
  wo n't deprive you of your sandwich prostitutes ... 
  because ... [ why not ?

   1 ) both russia and ukraine have arguably been severely punished for the way they conduct affairs . 
  russia 's economic situation is up for debate . 
  the collapse of oil prices and the cost of annexing crimea have no doubt contributed to the crisis they 're facing . 
  sanctions were not the sole factor . 
   ... there is a pretty consistent trend where lawless states end up in ruin , while countries that enforce the rule of law prosper . 
  correlation does n't equal causation . 
  china is a big exception to the rule here and i 'd point out india , indonesia ... pretty much all the brics countries .
