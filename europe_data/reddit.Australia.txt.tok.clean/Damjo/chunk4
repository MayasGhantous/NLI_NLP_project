  but this would then lead us to argue what `` prosperous '' and `` lawless '' mean . 
  it 's a discussion for another time . 
   ... while people responsible for war crimes on ukraine 's side will almost certainly be prosecuted down the line ... +  1 ) both russia and ** ukraine ** have arguably been severely punished ... 
  in other words , ukraine has n't been punished . 
   2 ) utilitarianism is neither a political nor a legal principle in the european tradition . 
  who 's discussing utilitarianism here ? 
  i did n't bring this up . 
  the rest of your second point is n't making sense . 
   3 ) parents do not have the right to put their children in harm 's way , and if that happens , the nation has a legal obligation to keep the children safe , even against the wishes of the parents . 
  the parents are trying to continue through europe . 
  separating families is n't going to solve anything and by doing so , you 've just added trauma , anxiety and stress to both the kids and the parents . 
  that 's aggravating the situation and you would ironically be accused of inhumane treatment for doing so by the media and politicians . 
  you 're being incredibly short-sighted on this and not looking at the real implications . 
   ... this is not a matter of cherry picking . 
  whether the children are put in harm 's way due to illegal immigration or for any other reason has no relevance whatsoever , because the circumstances do not change or affect what the government is obligated to do . 
  it is cherry picking because you 're putting up blinds to what the root problem is , * illegal immigration * . 
  the child would not be put in harm 's way if the parents were not trying to maneuver through europe instead of going through proper registration and protocol . 
  that 's the stem . 
  that 's the problem that needs to be tackled . 
  you need deterrence . 
   4 ) illegal immigration is a separate problem . 
  it is n't . 
  as above . 
  illegal immigration is cascading into all these other issues . 
  child abuse including . 
  i 'd like to remind you that countries have the right to make exceptions and let anyone they want into their country , whether they have identification or not . 
  then you 're illustrating my point earlier that laws are malleable and apply only when the jurisdiction actually enforces it . 
   ... factually speaking , these people are in greece legally . 
  nooo , factually speaking they are * illegal immigrants * . 
  greece may not be enforcing the law given the circumstances but the fact is they are * illegal immigrants * . 
  their presence in greece is not * legal * but it 's * tolerated * given the scale of the problem . 
   5 ) even if they were in greece illegally , the state is still bound to treat them in accordance with the human rights conventions let me be perfectly clear ; i am not and have not advocated in this discussion that they be stripped of their human rights . 
  they do need proper facilities ( and they insist on erecting their tents outside in the cold and mud instead of using these facilities ) but that ca n't be achieved with this influx and in such short time . 
  the more you encourage to risk their lives , the greater the obstacle that has to be traversed . 
  russia and the ukraine are signatories to the echr . 
  do you think that 's stopped them violating human rights in their proxy/civil war ? 
  of course not . 
  and you ca n't cherry pick your issues here ; you 're still bypassing the fact that the migrants are illegally entering the country . 
  the children would not be exposed to serious risk if the parents had n't violated the law . 
  like i said , you 're dealing with the smoke instead of the fire . 
  and i might gently remind you that waiving illegal entry as the core issue would be encouraging human trafficking/people smuggling . 
  they capitalise on the overlook in the end and that encourages ** more ** smuggling , ** more ** children put at risk , ** more ** violations of human rights . 
  ahh , of course , how could i be so blind !, 
  / s while in theory * yes , `` all laws apply at all times '' and `` laws are unfaltering '' * , you 'd be na\u00efve to think this applies in practice . 
  this is why a magistrate presides over a court . 
  this is why a lawyer interprets an article . 
  this is why legislation is constantly redrafted and improved . 
  because the law applies * when the law applies * . 
  there is always wiggle room and there is always something overlooked . 
  you may not like it but it 's absolutely the case , i guarantee you . 
  you 're acquitting the parents of any form of responsibility and for some reason you 're now wanting to frame the matter around child-abuse rather than illegal immigration . 
  you 're dealing with the smoke instead of the fire . 
   i really do n't understand your bewilderment here . 
  i dunno , just ... maybe you should proof-read your posts \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  separate the children and the parents . 
  and what are you trying to resolve here ? 
  parents are legal guardians of their children . 
  they took their kids on board dinghies , sail them out 200km into rough waters and bear the risks associated with it . 
  governments urge refugees * not * to take the dangerous route . 
  governments are not omnipotent beings that are present everywhere at all times . 
  your argument that i 'm ironically shifting blame makes absolutely no sense . 
  governments of course * do n't want * children to come to harm on their own soil but ** it was the parent who made that call ** . 
    no one 's comment ever : well , there are some children there , does the number really matter ? 
  do n't you dare use that card . 
  the parents are to blame for dragging the kids with them through dangerous waters and muddy camps . 
  that 's a risk the parents are taking and i 'll be damned if anyone , refugee or media or politician or any other tries to shift blame or responsibility unto others . 
  nobody is to blame but the families . 
  period . 
    how have we reached the point where the heroes are the ones with the cruelest no fucks given stance ? 
  fucks are given . 
  i , for one , give a fuck that for every day migrants/refugees stay in europe they effectively add to syria 's brain drain and will hinder its ability to get back on its feet once this stupid fucking war is over . 
  once the dust settles , they * need * to return to rebuild their country or syria will forever end up in third world limbo . 
    i realize their appeal , but come on we are better than this . 
  there is no fucking appeal . 
  neither left nor right . 
  europe is so fucking polarised nowadays i wonder if there is anyone rational still left on the bloody continent . 
  what 's with the legend box wearing a ridiculous `` bill '' hat ? 
  only because we get a steady stream of na\u00efve backpackers that we sacrifice to the bush god , skippy , in return for our safety , prosperity and fortune . 
  think it 's a coincidence we 're sitting on top of all of these sweet , sweet minerals ? 
  i think not !, 
  mate , how the fuck do we deal with moose ( meese ? 
  mooses ? 
  mice ? ) ? 
  i 've heard so many stories of people attacked by them . 
  edit : [ nevermind , think i found a way .

  ftfy, 
  you 'll have to get rid of those red stars pretty soon , maybe replace it with [ this one ] ( http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/15/102682735-3127-flag.530x298.png?v=1431699254 ), 
  what i hear you saying is , `` we should go to war . '', 
  ( yes , i 'm being facetious ) . 
  the eu functions well in peacetime because everyone went about their business and reduced tariffs and trade barriers amongst themselves . 
  there was mutual consensus . 
  nobody argues with economic growth and development . 
  when dealing with a * real * sovereignty tough nut , like the refugee crisis or a stand-offish neighbour annexing territories , europe goes ballistic with the inhouse fights and arguments . 
  because it 's 20-odd members have such a huge array of values and opinions on how things should be handled . 
  did you mean pathetic instead of pessimistic ? 
  that 's a ballsy question to ask . 
  i 'm not having a go at you , i just noticed the preposition you used and thought i 'd ask and have a laugh . 
  that got very interesting at the end .
