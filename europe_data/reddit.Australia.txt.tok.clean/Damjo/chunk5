  way to put a spin on that comment . 
  how fitting why the downvotes ? 
  have you guys not read orwell 's novels ? 
  alright , alright !, 
  i get it !, 
  you 're illiterate . 
   there is always a reason , the question is if you agree that the reason is sufficient or not . 
  well , yes but there did n't seem to be a reason behind what you wrote other than implying euroscepticism and wanting better foreign relations with russia is wrong . 
  what i was hoping to do was to get you to elaborate on that point - why is it wrong ? 
   i did research pegida , i understand them ( it 's not like extreme right movements have n't appeared in times of crisis before ) ... ha , pegida is n't extreme . 
  calling for mass extermination of a people is extreme . 
  of course , pegida 's rallies and demonstrations can and have been hijacked by more aggressive views and opinions but the same thing happens to the left camp as well . 
   do i have to play the devil 's advocate ? 
  is that a serious question ? 
  i 'm surprised you 'd even ask . 
   also from their wiki page :   the movement has also opposed nato and eu membership and has supported better relations with vladimir putin 's russia . 
  maybe ... there 's a reason ? 
  i do n't know but i 'd suggest researching , finding and entertaining an argument without necessarily accepting it ; rather than dismissing it altogether just because you do n't agree with it . 
  barbary pirates and the janissaries spring to mind . 
  also the arabs dabbling in the african slave trade as well , although that might be a stretch since one ca n't expressly say a huge chunk of africans that were sold off were , without doubt , christians . 
  i 'm probably wrong on some of this anyway but its worth reading up on . 
  i decided i had better things to do than look at a little boy holding his penis . 
  so i went to the delirium cafe and chow down some pomme frites . 
  best day ever . 
  or night . 
  i kind of lost track after a few glasses . 
  i had no intention of getting out of bed today . 
  thanks for giving me a reason to stay put !, 
  mate , i do n't know what classes you 're going to but you did ask . 
  if you still believe otherwise , then so be it . 
  i 'm bored of this convo . 
  that 's rubbish . 
  they do n't teach you to `` look confident . '', 
  you ** build ** confidence from training for different scenarios and honing your skills to deal with those situations . 
  you 're taught to scan your surroundings . 
  you 're taught to be alert . 
  you 're taught to counter and get distance . 
  you 're * not * taught to puff your chest like a maori . 
  three women were chosen for this study . 
  * three * . 
  how is that credible ? 
  that abstract has such little information to go by . 
  i promise you the way you carry yourself is not going to make a difference in whether you are targeted or not . 
  your size , height , vulnerability ( carrying stuff , looking distracted or disoriented , seated/standing , numbers ) will . 
  nobody is picking a fight with you because you have bad posture . 
  so you 're associating fear and uncertainty with looking scrawny , in other words . 
  offenders pick targets based on how confident the offender feels they can take on the target . 
  your fear and uncertainty are only going to affect how well you handle the situation - not how likely you are to being attacked . 
   i 've never had a clear nut shot . 
  sometimes you need a lot of flexibility to kick such a high target . 
    do you find though that once you can fight , people suddenly do n't want to bother you ? 
  how are they going to know i can fight ? 
  i 'm not a cut body-builder . 
  you ca n't tell just by appearance . 
  some of the best fighters at my gym are the smallest and skinniest there . 
  they 're quick and they 're accurate . 
  i 'm not ashamed to say i constantly had my ass handed to me by a girl half my height when we had ground sparring . 
  she could throw all the guys around on the floor like rag dolls , and she looks so timid and shy when she 's not on the mat . 
  you use what you have to your advantage . 
  small and thin ? 
  give those jug heads a cardio workout . 
  but really though , it depends on how motivated people are . 
  there 's no universal truth . 
  what i can tell you is that no guy is going to be charging at you after you 've send his testicles flying to his skull . 
  first time did n't work ? 
  try a second time . 
  and a third if he really ca n't afford a vasectomy . 
  yes i have . 
  both before and after i trained . 
  before , i did n't know what i was doing , just swinging like a madman . 
  in my fight after training was actually just a swift knee to the nuts . 
  that was enough to knock some sense back into the guy , after he took a moment to collect himself . 
  the number one priority is to firstly * avoid * these situations in the first place . 
  forget the dark alleyway or walking alone . 
  take a friend with you , use well lit paths etc. 
  second is to deescalate the situation ; run if you need to , hand over the wallet and cancel all your cards , talk calmly to the guy . 
  i mean , these are n't things people do n't already know . 
  but it 's just simply avoiding the situation in the first place that needs to be exercised . 
  if you 're in a dark alley , you need to be switched on . 
  fighting is a last resort when all other options fail . 
  but at least you can train for it and be prepared . 
  i 've practiced krav maga for two years . 
  firstly , someone attacking you is not defending themselves at the same time . 
  you 'd be surprised how much is left exposed and all the different counter attacks you can use . 
  second , it is never a sucker shot if you 're about to be attacked . 
  this is n't a fucking boxing match . 
  you or your so are in ** danger ** . 
  you 've surrendered your rights to your testicles when you lay your hands on someone else . 
  you gave south australia a dick , and victoria looks like a mongoloid jerking off . 
  bravo , sir . 
  amazing . 
  douze points, 
  i think ` fatbergs ' might answer your question here . 
  interesting ( and disgusting ) subject . 
  yes !, 
  throw boiling hot pasta at those bastards . 
  that 's the way !, 
  how do you check `` the official way '' ? 
  also , i do it the german way . 
  they 've got their shit together .
