equally bad clearly not , otherwise millions of impoverished people would n't be immigrating into industrial cities en masse to work in them . 
  subsistence farming means you have no or highly unreliable wage . 
  a sweatshop means you have meager , but steady wage . 
  when those are your options , the choice is clear . 
  sweatshop conditions are horrible by western standards , but from the perspective of a subsistence farmer , they 're working less and earning more . 
  eventually they 'll demand higher wages and better conditions , as is what happened in the west nearly a century ago . 
   and i did n't mention anything about communism yeah , you 're right . 
  i was half taking the piss , but your assumption that 100 % of all deaths in africa and india can be attributed to capitalism is even more laughable , honestly . 
  sweatshops  subsistence farming . 
  and again , this is irrelevant . 
  communism does n't work . 
   child mortality rate drops by a third since 1990 hmmm , what happened around 1990 ? 
  [ oh , that 's right ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dissolution_of_the_soviet_union ), 
  how many hundreds of millions is capitalism currently lifting out of poverty in china and india . . ? 
  capitalism fucks up often and is far from perfect , but there was once a time not so long ago when africa-tier famines happened in asia regularly . 
  this idea seems impossible to us now , and it 's no thanks to marxism . 
  i 'd prefer the system that works maybe half the time over the one that works none of the time . 
  it says it took 300 years for the population to recover . 
  that 's crazy . 
   edit2 : waltzing matilda waltzing matilda , who fuckin ' killed her ? 
  lying in the grass with a dagger up her arse , with the birds and the bees and the naked aborigines , you 'll come a ` waltzing matilda with me !, 
  what happened from 1340-1350 ? 
  plague ? 
  edit : yep https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_death never knew it was * that * devastating . 
   its like a tolerant and accepting society does not breed extremists so easily really ? 
  you do n't think it 's more likely because your population is less that 0.1 % muslim ? 
  ours is 1.9 % and we 've had hundreds of people going to me to fight for isis . 
  many attempted terrorist attacks ( mostly foiled , luckily ) . 
  [ see here ] ( http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/original-size/20140830_mac990_2.png ) , i see no fighters from poland or hungary ( or portugal ) . 
  america , which is way less tolerant on the social level , has barely any !, 
  integration has waaaay more to do with it than tolerance . 
   but the chance of a french dying who cares ? 
  they should n't be dying at all , they would n't be dying if it was n't for their governments foolishness , and continuing to import hundreds of thousands of people who hate you and your way of life , surprisingly , is n't making it better . 
  it 's not even the terrorism . 
  it 's the crime , it 's the sectarian violence , it 's the ghettos , it 's the continuing degradation of a once culturally cohesive society . 
  example : australia has a large lebanese population , majority christian or jewish , but some muslim . 
  these people are the same ethnicity ( no pretending racism is what 's doing it ) but the muslim lebanese are responsible for far more crime and terrorist activity than the christians ( almost all of it , in fact ) . 
  why is that ? 
  it 's the same with the arabs . 
  most in australian are christians , but it 's only the muslims causing trouble . 
  personally , i 'm fucking sick of having * my * rights and freedoms slowly stripped away by the government in the name of counter-terrorism , so they can all keep pretending the problem does n't lie in a single religious group 99 % of the time . 
  i ca n't imagine how bad it 'd be if we were n't an island and did n't have a sensible refugee policy . 
  well , they kind of do . 
  how many terrorist attacks have there been in poland or czechia , hungary or portugal ? 
  the only country i can think of that bucks the ` more muslims = more terrorism ' trend is italy . 
  not really . 
  jesus was depicted differently depending on the group being converted , the point was to make him seem similar to you . 
  in scandinavia he 'd be depicted as blonde with blue eyes , in greece and italy , brown hair brown eyes , in ethiopia he 'd be black . 
  [ asian jesus ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ec/1c/35/ec1c35bbefc008e6b5d1c581a8c684fd.jpg ) , for example . 
  the greek gods are hilarious . 
  they 're like a big dysfunctional family who pawn their problems off onto us mortals . 
   do you know how many people were killed by drunk drivers last week i hate this logic with a burning passion . 
  so fucking what ? 
  what happens if/when we get to a stage where terrorism kills more than ` your kitchen ' ? 
  will you just shift the goalposts again and claim it kills less than obesity , so just stop talking about it ? 
  when you have a problem , you tend not to try and make it worse , or at least acknowledge it exists . 
   mike `` electroshock '' pence i 'm sure you meant to say mike ` ac/dc for the lgbt ' pence . 
  same reason i can imagine jews voting for a far right party . 
  the mentality of a battered housewife . 
  * `` i c-can change him !, 
  i swear !, 
  he 's not a bad guy !, 
  i just n-need to keep appeasing him '' *, 
  ca n't make this shit up . 
  t. juan, 
  soros is the murdoch of the right . 
  i wish both of them would just hurry up and die tbh , they 're both subversive scum . 
  they do , and if they did n't the market would n't allow for it . 
  if companies could get away with paying women less , they absolutely would , and men would suffer as a result . 
  businesses already abuse the shit out of 457 to bring in * fucking frycooks from india * , no way they would n't do the same in this case . 
  what ? 
  they really think some boss is paying women less for shits and giggles ? 
  because they hate women ? 
  and it has n't caused a media shitstorm ? 
  spare me . 
  because if we did that we 'd never turn off the lights , we 'd have a new flag every couple of hours . 
  those places are warzones . 
  what am i solving for here ? 
  that was a bloodbath . 
  yeah , and every time something good happens ( was it boeing that was opening a new factory in britain ? ), 
  everyone tries to downplay it as nothing . 
  nah , more likely they 'll just come here ( oz ) if they like the weather so much . 
  we already have 1.1 million british expats , whats a few hundred thousand more ? 
  history does n't have a right or wrong side . 
  sadiq ` terrorism is a part of city life ' khan, 
  intersectionality is a mental illness . 
  ` marginal offenses ' such as pointing a gun at a cop .

  maybe he 's a time traveller [ from the 1820s ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bourbon_restoration ), 
  albronia !, 
  i prefered belgrade to brussels , honestly . 
  ah , he 'll have plenty of time for praising authoritarian socialist regimes and breadlines , then . 
  get ready for the ramadan bomb-a-thon . 
  were, 
  delet this, 
  perth is saffer country . 
  seems possible . 
  our biggest net emigration destination is apparently south sudan . 
  returning and deported refugees . 
  they 'll go in there , [ heads bowed in fear ] ( https://www.unwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/women-swedish.jpg ) like slaves to their master in person , though .
