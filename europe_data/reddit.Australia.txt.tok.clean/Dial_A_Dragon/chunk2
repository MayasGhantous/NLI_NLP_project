  honestly , by that point , constantinople was a husk . 
  buildings were giving way to fields and the empire was nearly dead . 
  1453 was a mercy killing . 
  the real tragedy was 1204 . 
  anyone to the right of stalin . 
  it 's only meant as a joke . 
  istanbul ( european turkey ) alone has a larger population than bulgaria or greece . 
   field of science social science is not a science . 
  sorry you blew thousands of dollars to be brainwashed . 
   physics ai n't worth shit then physics does n't have the academic rigor of wet toilet paper , unlike social science . 
   is n't a problem inherent to the social sciences at this scale ? 
  most fields can at least manage a 50 % replication rate . 
  social ` science ' ca n't seem to scrape even that together . 
  that brutal comeback caused him to short circuit . 
  \\  butthurt about horseshoe theory \\  is a socialist the greatest red detector ever devised . 
  like you can talk , von habsburg . 
  considering what an absolute shitshow social science is right now , i honestly could n't care less ` how well defined ' it is . 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sokal_affair the most famous . 
  an actual scientist completely made up a paper jerking off marxist ideology and got it printed by a ` respected ' publisher in the field . 
  http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716 psychology ca n't get its replication rate above 50 % , social psychology is particularly bad .

  there 's a reason they 're called the ` soft ' sciences . 
  i already said , a vile malignant cancer . 
  although ` mental illness ' and ` cult ' could also work . 
  they 're free to go somewhere else if france is too oppressive , frankly , nothing of value would be lost . 
  i 'm sorry , but you 've got to have a single digit iq to find this funny . 
  intersectionality is a vile malignant cancer , i 'm very glad ( and surprised , honestly ) to see europe standing up against it . 
  such an aesthetic shape .

  your points based immigration system would be considered far-right in europe . 
  ours would be considered literally hitler . 
  butthurt . 
  welcome to the world of russians and brits . 
  [ really makes me think ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/most-europeans-want-muslim-ban-immigration-control-middle-east-countries-syria-iran-iraq-poll-a7567301.html ) more likely most of you guys do n't want any more mass immigration , but do n't think things have gotten bad enough yet to vote for a nutcase firebrand to stop it . 
  \\  iran will never be zoroastrian again feels fucking terrible man, 
  that other language is hindi , i think . 
  diversity is a shit ideal . 
  do n't mind me , just laying some shit bait . 
  it 's part of russia , but the chechens fought a couple of wars of independence when the ussr collapsed with russia eventually taking it back . 
  central russian government control there is still pretty weak apparently , and most of the ethnic russians were kicked out during the wars . 
  a russian can probably clarify . 
  actions vs words . 
  eu did nothing after the syrian gas attack , meanwhile trump bombed their airfield . 
  if bombing a russian ally is pro-russia , then i guess the eu is actually the warsaw pact in disguise ? 
  i do n't even like trump , but your argument is just daft . 
  he 'd be right . 
  russia is n't anywhere near as powerful as the ussr was , it 's silly to compare the two . 
  a you for real mate ? 
  temporary settlement worked fine for the yugoslav wars . 
  hard to have unity when you ca n't even understand your neighbour . 
  estonia is so beautiful . 
  what are the green and yellow parties ? 
  `` a few thousand '' becomes `` a few hundred thousand '' then `` a few million '' in no time . 
  i can tell you 've been waiting for this ever since it became clear that the banks were n't leaving london . 
  does n't matter if it was 1000 years ago or yesterday . 
  if you were n't involved in a crime , you are innocent . 
  non-eu immigrants make up [ 7.7 % of the british population ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3433488/5579176/ks-sf-11-034-en.pdf/63cebff3-f7ac-4ca6-ab33-4e8792c5f30c ) but take 20.3 % of the welfare ? 
  is that supposed to be a good figure ? 
  if your parents robbed me , should you be punished ? 
  how about your children ? 
  ah , this must be that ` cultural appropriation ' i 've heard so much about . 
   sommers is kind of a pariah among most people who study the subject given the current state of sociology , that 's probably a good thing . 
  the most popular english speaking news website is the daily mail . 
  just because it 's popular , does n't mean it 's good . 
  q u i n t e s s e n t i a l l y, 
  the * reeaaaal * tragedy . 
   with them you want foreign food ? 
  no worries , i love foreign food too . 
  [ behold ] ( http://allrecipes.com/ ) , you can steal the riddle of the kebab without importing any of the social problems . 
  there are barely any mexicans in australia yet we still manage to make tacos just fine . 
   how ? 
  eastern europe has managed to increase it 's birthrate considerably over the last couple of years . 
  latvia , for example , went from 1.2 ( lowest in the eu ) to 1.7 , becoming one of the [ highest in the eu ] ( http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/notikumi/2015-birth-rates-baltic-states-kept-increasing-45283.html ) , and is expected to keep on increasing for the foreseeable future . 
  czechia has done the same . 
  poland , russia , japan , hungary , all experiencing a minor baby boom and ( not japan , admittedly ) strong economic growth ( many with over 3 % ) despite barely having any immigrants at all . 
  dunno the specifics of their birth policy , but whatever it is , it seems to be working . 
   taco trucks on every corner what ? 
   problem is the birth rate is n't high increase it . 
  terrorism will keep happening because a diverse group of people from all religions and cultures living side by side in peace and harmony is pure delusion . 
  it pushes down the wages of the natives , damages social cohesion , increases crime and terrorism ( especially from mena ) and increases ethnic strife and hatred . 
  the nation-state model is proven to be effective for hundreds of years , and disrupting this model for ` muh raw gdp is all that matters ' will lead to ( is currently leading to ) disaster . 
  immigration should be a trickle of niche requirements not available locally ( doctors , scientists , etc ) , not the chaotic flood of uneducated violent fundamentalists it is right now . 
  a high birth rate would achieve all the same ends as mass immigration re growing the economy , minus all that bullshit . 
   a world without borders high school tier naivete . 
  there are still people in the year of our lord jesus christ 2017 who believe there is no good reason to dislike mass immigration . 
  our media seem to be modeled after that of our former colonial overlord . 
  most news is little more than trash tabloids . 
  deflection . 
  we followed the us into the middle east and still manage to spend our obligated amount on defense . 
  running out of ammo for small arms in a * war game * is just pathetic . 
  `` drink this poison or leave '', 
  amerifats , when will they learn ? 
  islam is not a race . 
  such a nice language . 
  tally all those dead up , triple the body count of you want , it still comes in less than the orlando shooting . 
  a single event . 
  would n't have been so naive as to import tens of millions of culturally incompatible people in the first place , but too late now .
