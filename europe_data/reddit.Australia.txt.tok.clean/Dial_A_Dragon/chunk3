  we 've fucked ourselves over for generations to come . 
  it 's been the goal since 610 ad, 
  drawing a picture of mohammad was enough for them to kill twenty people . 
  is that ` treating them like enemies ' ? 
  atheists can resist running trucks through crowds of people , if that 's what you mean . 
  if canada is anything like the us or australia , then you already have an assimilationist/melting pot model . 
  ah well . 
  at least they 've gotten past the ` assimilation = racism ' phase . 
  ganges delta is one of the most fertile regions in the world , it 's always had a large population since humans first settled there . 
  religious population combined with green revolution and advanced medical technology meant their population exploded crazily post independence : in the 70s the average bangladeshi women had 7 children . 
  just crazy . 
  australia 's [ refugee policy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) is very strict . 
  the policy is illegal arrivals will never be granted citizenship , and the boats are just towed back outside of our eec . 
  sinking boats are sent to nauru ( pretty much our vassal ) to be processed/deported . 
  this allows us to bypass the un refugee laws , as nauru is n't a signatory . 
  after a crushing labor defeat in 2013 , this policy became bi-partisan and is very unlikely to go away . 
  i personally strongly support it , because [ it worked ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/boat_people_arrivals_vs_afghan_returnees.png ) ( that sudden increase in 2008 is what resulted in labor 's defeat and their change in stance ) . 
  recently , the government attempts to appeal to nationalist/populist and anti-islam voters by [ preferencing ] ( http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/syrian-civil-war-turnbull-gives-priority-to-christian-refugees-over-muslims/news-story/88206e63a6245c3a690f64bfc9ab89e6 ) christians , druze and secular refugees over muslims . 
  as a result , the majority of arab australians are christians ( maronites , copts , orthodox ) , not muslims like in europe . 
  they tend not to cause anywhere near as much trouble , so i agree with this policy too . 
  our immigration policy is something else , though : the requirements to be granted citizenship are very high and we have a points based system . 
  you have to be very educated ( and in demand ) or wealthy to have a chance . 
  as an anecdote , a relative recently tried to get over here from serbia , she was an environmental scientist and was still rejected . 
  regardless , our immigration rate is ~ 190,000 / year and our population is 26 % immigrant , almost all from europe ( britain especially , though many from italy and greece ) , nz , south africa ( mostly rhodies and afrikaans ) and asia . 
  so i actually looked it up and there 's barely any [ pakistanis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pakistani_australians ) in australia compared to [ indians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indian_australians ) . 
  i 'm surprised . 
   what kind of support do you propose ? 
  financial support for children , incentives for having a larger family , pro-natalist propaganda , etc. 
   indians , pakistani , bangladeshi do n't they integrate well in europe ? 
  in australia south asians , indians especially , assimilate the best out of all non-european immigrants . 
  ( muslim ) arabs and africans do cause trouble here , though . 
  politicians , presumably . 
  yeah , stuff like that 's pretty fucked up . 
  the person he is responding to is talking about all of europe , though . 
  poland is experiencing an increase in birth rates , too . 
  mass immigration is just kicking the can down the road . 
  a lot of this seems pretty reasonable . 
  good luck , britain . 
  dunno why permanent resettlement has become the only possible solution , they did n't do that during the yugoslav wars : most serbs and bosnians have returned . 
  permanent settlement is pretty much political poison by this point . 
  wow , what a racist , sexist , islamoph - what ? 
  he 's not white ? 
  ah , carry on then . 
  who ? 
  remainers ? 
  i think he was taking the piss :  commander , gerhard von kamptz , refused to surrender to the soviets , as his orders were to surrender to the western allies . 
  the germans sent several telegrams to copenhagen requesting that at least one british soldier should be transferred to bornholm , so that the germans could surrender to the western allied forces instead of the soviets . 
  when von kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the soviet commanders , soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in r\u00f8nne and nex\u00f8 and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more on 7 -- 8 may 1945 . 
  at least latinos are christian/secular and western . 
  labour parties seem to be getting crushed all across the world right now , except here . 
  cultural christians . 
   more realistically because poland does n't mess in middle east poland was one of the [ four countries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_involvement_in_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq ) to invade iraq . 
  drink this poison !, 
  i like how he immediately got destroyed . 
  yeah , either both are protected free political speech or neither are . 
  they were comitted by the sons of refugees and immigrants . 
  they are even more extreme than their parents but you ca n't even kick them out . 
  frankly , i have no idea how you would fix this , you 've fucked your demographics up for generations to come . 
  slamming the door on further arrivals would be a good start , though, 
  t. alberto barbosa, 
  a knife is a weapon , so is an atom bomb . 
  clearly they 're exactly the same !, 
  \\  innsbruck \\  big, 
  ` i am firmly convinced that spain is the strongest country of the world . 
  century after century trying to destroy herself and still no success . ' t. bismark, 
  good point . 
  maybe they would 've just held off invasion and instead tried to contain germany and japan until the atom bomb could be developed . 
  d-day would 've been an absolute bloodbath otherwise . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the russians focused on a single albeit very large front . 
  they were the major force to defeat the germans , for sure , but the * whole * war ? 
  they had next to nothing to do with italy and did n't even declare war on japan until the twilight of wwii . 
  the americans fought on three fronts ( western , african , pacific ) and dealt with japan almost single-handedly , all the while supplying the allies with most of the war materials ( much of britain 's industry was bombed to oblivion by this point ) , so i 'd argue their overall contribution was larger . 
  in reality , i doubt it could 've been done if the americans had n't got involved , i also doubt it could 've been done if the ussr had n't been drawn into the fighting . 
  imagine the entire german army was concentrated in france on d-day , best case the allies would have to push a truce . 
  well , his face is all over their money . 
  the ` h ' in their logo stands for hitler . 
  brits should come down here for a hunting trip , outside of tasmania foxes are a major pest . 
   defeat of germany : ussr , ** italy ** ouch . 
  looks like we 've shrunk by seven eighths and swallowed up southwest russia and part of ukraine . 
  they do n't suffer misplaced guilt , either . 
   fleeing france in their thousands is what he said . 
  brexit and trump were unexpected in their respective countries , so they 've the go to comparison for anything populist . 
  americans and sometimes british ( and us australians , but even our big two parties are slowly being eaten by the minor parties ) seem to project their two party system onto foreign politics , where it 's either i or o , either the nationalist won , or they did n't . 
  because of this binary view , they see it as a loss . 
  what they do n't see is fn more than doubling their support , or wilders gaining five seats in the house of reps , both results that from ( what i can tell ) their supporters were fairly happy with . 
  but the rise of the right pretty much the case all over the western world , far-right parties have been steadily increasing support , and have made particularly strong gains in the last few years , with their supporters hoping one day to form government . 
  they 're ( both t_d and anti-fn ) are trying to see it as this epic final battle between teams red and blue , but most country 's politics are n't like that at all . 
  why is ... whatever that thing is eating christians ? 
  [ theyre right , though ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_france#antisemitism_and_jewish_emigration )  immigration from france is on the rise : in the first half of 2015 , approximately 5,100 french jews made aliyah to israel marking 25 % more than in the same period during the previous year . 
   no country in europe that actually wants to leave well , we do n't really know , since britain is the only country to have actually had a referendum . 
  well this is a quality thread . 
  hey / u/blackjack _ bot deal me in . 
   that 's kinda big not really . 
  lots of people get irrationally salty about politics , me included . 
  french rust belt . 
  right ? 
  ah , so you 're worried your gibs will be taken away ? 
   globalisation has so far primarily benefited the rich industrialized world . 
  while this is true , [ most of those benefits have just floated to the top ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2014/01/ft_cotw124.png ) of the industrialised countries .
