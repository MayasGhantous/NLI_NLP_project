  no , we really do n't . 
  at the nation state level it is survival of the fittest . 
  / r/the _ donald is the most fun place on reddit . 
  meme magic and watching leftists take it all seriously is just the icing on the cake . 
  they 'll never stop making fun of the swedes and trolling them . 
  it 's like when tumblr tried to fight back against 4chan provocations - they 're doing it for the lulz and thus you ca n't hurt them . 
  instead that sub grew 6000 users in a day . 
  human lemming . 
  it 's not monolithic though , so it 's not like your displacing the only incumbent that owns the market lock and key . 
  an example is in australia . 
  sap used to have a lock on government , but now a lot of departments both state and federal have moved off sap due to cost and botched implementations and instead went with technologyone 's lighter weight erp . 
  are going to be not currently being . 
  erp is an order of magnitude more complex than crm and unpicking an implementation is really hard so they 're going to have a strong annuity base in the future . 
  i see them in the same position as peoplesoft 5 years ago . 
  really strong but lazy and then suddenly fundamentally challenged by a cloud native successor . 
  in their case it was workday . 
  i do n't know who the existential threat to sap is going to be - perhaps its salesforce or workday releasing a `` good enough for 90 % of you '' that targets mid market and then moves up into big enterprises the same way they did in crm and hcm . 
  but the challenger is coming . 
  sap is a dinosaur . 
  they are being massively disrupted . 
  the special sauce is gone and hana wo n't save them . 
  mountains and albanians i expect . 
  fair enough on your opinion . 
  i do n't value these people enough to invest that much over such a long term for such a low chance of having things work out , so i doubt we 'll have a meeting of minds . 
  fair enough . 
  what would your standard be in terms of safety before we sent people back ? 
  but is the only form of help bringing them to your european paradise , or could your ideology be satisfied by providing aid that makes their homes more bearable to live in . 
  just an apologist, 
  show me on the doll where the 4chan touched you . 
  absolutely . 
  i think the gurkha situation is actually far more egregious given they were official servicemen of the armed forces . 
  maybe its the american culture seeping into everything we do but i 'm of the view that if you honourably serve the nation in the armed forces you should receive citizenship at all the benefits it entails , assuming you want it - it 's what the french do with the foreign legion . 
  that the western powers in afghanistan and iraq did n't take care of their translators and other local support is a massive shame . 
  i 'm not for mass migration but people like this have ( at least in my mind ) earned the a shot at making a life for themselves in the nation that they had served . 
  we got wires crossed , i was agreeing with you . 
  people just dismiss the question of why poor east asian migrants with limited skills do n't tend to radicalize and people just act as if they 're all professionals or educated , which explains the difference . 
  that excuse just does n't hold , as you pointed out . 
  yeah . 
  amazing stereotyping of east asian migrants . 
  how is that considered an attack ? 
  i lived in the gulf for many years . 
  one of the things i noticed is that the locals ( obviously with a few exceptions ) did not want you to integrate into their culture , you just simply were not welcome . 
  instead what society expected of you was to forego ( or at least keep quiet ) any activity or thing against their culture or religion and to keep to your own , and not make a fuss and above all do the job they brought you in for . 
  in business it was considered good form to have some grasp of arabic but if you did n't look or act like a westerner they would be offended and your colleagues embarrassed . 
  dubai is always the odd one out in terms of how much it catered to westerners , but that was always a function of its economy being built on trade , finance and tourism . 
  to be fair no westerner is a permanent migrant there - you 're a guest worker . 
  there is no expectation that you will live there beyond the time required for the task you do . 
  in that environment it makes little sense to try and assimilate . 
  when have conquered peoples ever expected anything other than subjugation ? 
  over time those people got some benefits ( i.e. 
  better security , albeit a bit soft in the commitment to it ) but i agree the constant depression of being tax harvested and looted is a pretty massive downside . 
  yeah , it was good for the roman people and those that eventually romanised . 
  why would anyone expect to have the benefits of rome without being roman ? 
  i think we were arguing across purposes . 
  edit : to whoever is doing it , the down vote button is for comments that do n't contribute to a discussion , not just things you disagree with . 
  if you do n't like my opinion that 's fine . 
  just do n't be a childish cunt . 
  well it lasted the better part of 1500 years , and for a lot of it securely . 
  was it perfect ? 
  of course not and a lot of people got proper fucked by barbarians . 
  but within its borders there was rule of law and security of a form . 
  large swathes of the world were completely lawless at the time . 
  except for the huge population that had physical security as a result of the empire . 
  sure it was n't all rosy but it 's better than getting your face smashed in by gauls . 
  rome went the same way and turned out great . 
  bring on a god emperor for europe . 
  come to south london . 
  carrib culture alive and well , for the most part working fine . 
  we would love it . 
  banter aside you guys are always welcome . 
  i would love for you guys to join a freedom of movement agreement . 
  literally the biggest difference between us all is geography , on every other level we are far more aligned than say germany , france and the u.k. 
  the ability to freely work across the anglosphere would be amazing . 
  well aside from the fact that those countries do a hell of a lot in the eu , they just do n't want to do this particular thing that they do n't agree with that you want to force on them against the tradition of consensus in the eu . 
  but sure , go characterise the east as a bunch of freeloaders . 
  so typical of rich european countries . 
  it 's a union , but only when it suits you . 
  different opinion ? 
  penalties !, 
  this is a proper nimble navigator . 
  you 're bang on . 
  i my position can basically be summed up as `` i want * a * european union , just not * this * european union '' . 
  this matches my experience in investment banking . 
  graduates came from a huge range of fields like law , engineering , computer science , math , life sciences and medicine .
