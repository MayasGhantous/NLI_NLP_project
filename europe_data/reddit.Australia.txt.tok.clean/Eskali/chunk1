so long as parliament is required to pass any war declarations , there 's not too much to fear , there are too many different entities for anyone to get large unquestionable support at the federal level . 
  hell , if the eu federalized its army then it could safely spend 1 % of its gdp on defense !, 
  f-22 has featured some pretty hefty incremental cost increases due to several issues/features since ending production , increment 3.2 bravo had some pretty expensive avionics added , about 30million per f-22 . 
  stating the first version price is like saying the f-16 costs only 20million when the latest version costs closer to 60 million . 
  nope , 180million flyaway right now , 340million + including development . 
  i 'm with ya mate , we shattered their society , we now live in luxury while they are trapped in a negative feedback loop of self-destructiveness , its our duty to aid them . 
  while they spend a fair amount , their capabilities and percentage of gdp are vastly less then france and britain . 
  their army especially is lacking in force projection and their roe is extremely debilitating . 
  they 've been flying them since 2006 and costs are coming down , they know how much it costs to make them , http://www.aspistrategist.org.au/decision-time-for-australias-f-35-plans/ f-35 flyaway is to be 90 million after optimisation , currently at 96 million . 
  yes it 's more expensive their first projections in early 2000 's but since 2010 it 's been on track pretty well and still the best value multi-role plane . 
  here 's another treat , a danish f-16 taking out ( virtually ) a eurofighter . 
  here 's the relevant [ article ] ( http://theaviationist.com/2012/07/13/fia12-typhoon-raptor/ )  indeed , it looks like the f-22 tends to lose too much energy when using thrust vectoring ( tv ) : tv can be useful to enable a rapid direction change without losing sight of the adversary but , unless the raptor can manage to immediately get in the proper position to score a kill , the energy it loses makes the then slow moving stealth combat plane quite vulnerable . 
  it 's not . 
  the f-35 is a very advanced piece of kit with the most advanced avionics . 
  its electronic suites are unparalleled along with the best cas support . 
  most people are ignorant of how air forces work . 
  the f-35 is not an air-superiority fighter designed to dogfight , that 's for the f-22 . 
  it 's replacing the f-18 , f-16s and harriers and is vastly superior in those roles , its designed for cas and bvr along with sensor fusion and data sharing over the battlefield , although its high off-bore sighting does provide some tricks for wvr . 
  i think your being sarcastic but to be informative , such maneuvers are actually bad , i was reading an article about the f-22 's thrust vectoring nozzle and how pilots avoided using it in combat because it bleeds off their kinetic energy for very little potential and dog-fighting is all about that energy . 
  its a fancy trick that does n't offer any advantage in * most * engagements . 
  no its not , the f-35 is 90million a piece , the only cheaper 4.5 + western gen fighter is the gripen . 
  the costs are mainly the f-35b / c and development costs * only * affect the us , not third parties buying at flyaway price . 
  the f-35 's are not `` extremely expensive '' they are cheaper then the eurofighter and rafale , the negative is that it is n't a mature unit unlike the ef and rafale . 
  the whole `` massive cost '' that 's over blown by the media is only for development costs ( mostly the f-35b ) which * only * affects the us and is n't even that high considering all of the roles the plane will cover and how advanced it is . 
  the f-16 block 50 's and 60 's are very advanced planes , do n't underestimate them . 
  f-22 's are pretty expensive too , nearly 200million usd a piece . 
  there were reports of a plane breaking down , check / r/ukrainianconflict, 
  that 's like arguing slave owners are great for giving their slaves food and housing . 
   but this is n't an issue ( as much ) with a war with russia , since we share a huge land border . 
  it cuts down deployment times to hours instead of days , avoiding the russians from taking on forces piecemeal which is their best method of offense . 
   this issue is being partially solved by the introduction of the a400m stated this earlier , but its not in service today . 
   most russian tanks are still unupgraded from the soviet era . 
  no match for a modern leopard ii . 
  i 'm not sure you understand just how severely the eu armies have cut tanks . 
  there are currently about 1,100 leopard 2 's in service within the eu , their are about 800 t-90 's ( which matches the l2 ) in service with russia , again , eu barely has the edge . 
   the eu would immediately have airsuperiority as well , making any kind of large scale attack into europe impossible . 
  again , as demonstrated , the eu has more aircraft but not enough to establish `` air superiority '' as we know it today , combined with russia very large fielding of aa units , its doubtful they every could . 
  the only thing russia could do is defend what they have for some time , but when their sam sites are taken out ( probably by cruise missile ) even that would be though . 
  eu would not attack russia , they simply do n't have the forces in position to do such a thing , russia does have forces in position to attack the eu . 
  you would not use cruise missiles for fear of russia using theirs against the eu , of which they have an huge advantage in numbers . 
   this is not even taking into account the large number of f-35 's already ordered . 
  airsuperiority would also make any strategic bombers of russia totally useless . 
  strategic bombers are only useful these days if you have complete air superiority , like the us in afghanistan or iraq . 
  again with the mythical unit , the eu does not have the f-35 and russia is also bring the pak-fa online at the same time , so their is no advantage to be had here , merely status quo , plus , most eu nations are n't using the f-35 . 
   strategic bombers are only useful these days if you have complete air superiority , like the us in afghanistan or iraq . 
  that 's not how strategic bombers are designed to work , especially the tu-160 , do you know anything about military equipment at all ? 
  the tu-160 would fly north into the arctic then curves around and strikes from the norwegian sea with stand-off cruise missiles . 
   * lt. gen. igor khvorov claimed that tu-160s managed to penetrate the us sector of the arctic undetected on 25 april 2006 , leading to a usaf investigation according to a russian source * . 
   this is all even assuming the eu does n't use its enormous industrial capacity ( by far the largest in the world ) towards wartime production . 
  most armies in the eu almost always train together , there is a huge focus on cooperation and coordination , i do not think that would be a big problem . 
  this is n't ww2 cobbling together tin cans , modern machines are extremely complex , it would take a year to put factory 's together to start pumping out units . 
  if the war has gone on that long , russia would have started using nukes . 
   most armies in the eu almost always train togheter , there is a huge focus on cooperation and coordination , i do not think that would be a big problem . 
  only in the nato framework , their are no eu military exercises . 
  they are still using different unit designs under different commands with different languages , all massive hindrances which the russians do n't have . 
  looking at budget/personale numbers is meaningless , labor costs , material costs , what projects they aim for , corruption , efficiency , all of this factors in , how it 's spent is what matters . 
  eu militaries are not geared to send forces abroad except for france and uk . 
  all of the militaries except for the uk and france lack heavy lift capabilities , they lack expeditionary stanced forces and strategic assets . 
  they simply are not geared to provide large support anywhere , aka , force projection . 
  balls to the wall fist fight could potentially see ; europe major 's : france can deploy 1 armored , 1mech , 1motor , uk 1 armored , 1 mechanized , germany has 2 heavy divisions , italy 2 mechanised , spain 1 mechanised 1 motor , belgium + netherlands can field 1 motor division , poland 1 armored 2 mechanized . 
  greece could potentially field 1 armored , 2 mech . 
  minors portugal + sweden + denmark + austria + czech + slovakia + latvia + estonia + lithuania + hungary + bulgaria could all potentially form 5 motor and 2 mech divisions . 
  unable to find finland/romania 's orbat . 
  total eu could put together roughly ** 6 armored , 11 mechanised and 8 motor divisions . 
  ** for the sake of argument russia forms motorised brigades with tanks attached , bringing the firepower up to a mechanised brigade . 
  russia has : western : 2 armored 1 mechanised southern : 4 mechanised central : 1 armored , 2 mechanised 4 motor eastern : 3 mechanised . 
  total of ** 3 armored , 10 mechanised , 4 motor divisions . 
  ** air force russia : 355 su-27 70 su-30 / 5 300 mig-29 250 mig-31 total ** 975 ** 600 su-24 / 25 100 tu-22 60 tu-95 eu : 400 eurofighter 120 rafale 180 mirage 2000 160 gripen 400 f-16 total = ** 1460 ** 300 tornado eu clearly has the field in air superiority but not by that much . 
  russia also has a lot of air defence units and very good aa systems , they also posses a lot of strategic assets ( ballistic missiles , strategic bombers etc ) unlike the eu which are severely lacking . 
  russia already has a majority of its forces ready to pounce , so traveling is n't an issue unlike the eu where they would have to travel up to 4,000 km to reach the front . 
  russia vs eu , against the combined might of the eu , russia is going to lose at a 2:1 ratio ** but ** russia is one cohesive unit , the eu is a mish mash both tactically ( unit integration , language ) and strategically ( politics ) , russia also posses a lot of strategic assets like medium/long ballistic missiles and strategic bombers etc. 
  russia most definitely has a chance to win through attacking fast and taking eu forces on piecemeal while causing political havoc through strategic assets . 
  this is all of course ignoring the white elephant , usa and turkey , but without them , the eu and russia stand a fairly close fight . 
  not that war is going to happen , ridiculous , but its fun to compare the numbers , the eu is not in a * strong * position , solid , but not strong . 
  ** tl ; dr ** russia is a very big fucking country that is highly militarised , good underdog fight against eu . 
  eu could n't defend shit , their militaries are in shambles except for a few ( france is very solid , uk is good , poland/germany are ok ) , everyone else has virtually no force projection ability . 
  edit : the eu combined could barely outmatch russia , ** if ** ( very big if ) everyone worked together they 'd have a 2:1 advantage at best and the russians are a coherent force and their troops have been modernising very fast the last few years . 
  if russia attacked fast enough and caught eu assets separately they could potentially win a war against the eu . 
  in a few years once they have the a400 this wont be ** as ** severe . 
  if i was as crazy as these guys i would only dive with people who i completely trust and have faith in , and if someone is that dear to me i would n't leave their bodies without trying everything . 
  i would feel like i had abandoned them if i did , its only natural they would feel the same , its not that i would want them to recover my body , its that i understand them . 
  racist ... 
  its short-sighted to say `` its quite foolish to risk more lives to recover bodies '' . 
  we do this all the time in society , from natural disasters to structural collapses to military operations . 
   also , what morale ? 
  this is n't a war , they 're hobby divers . 
  a business needs high moral to be productive and innovative etc just the other day there was a report that stated happiness lead to higher productivity , http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/academic/proto/workingpapers/happinessproductivity.pdf morale is extremely important in many different environments . 
  no its not , your view is extremely short-sighted . 
  when these guys are diving this deep they want at least the peace of minds their families can bury them . 
  this is for morale , they are n't machines . 
  edit : seriously , do none of you understand the concept of morale ? 
  their fellow divers are n't going to leave their bodies down there without trying their damndest . 
  its as much about the knowledge you wo n't be abandoned as it is about their fellow divers feeling like they have n't abandoned their friends . 
  to suggest they do otherwise is extremely machiavellian and inhuman . 
  i would n't go diving with any of you . 
  stereotyping entire race by one persons actions ... racism, 
  you can do that , but your still racist . 
  politicians would sell their grandmothers into slavery for more votes , that they would make racist comments to get votes is nothing surprising . 
  unless you are discussing scientific data or making comedy , just do n't talk about race . 
   at the risk of sounding racist i 'll state what ive seen .
