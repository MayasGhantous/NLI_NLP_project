  yes , you are . 
  whenever you or anyone says `` i 'm not racist but ... '' just . 
  stop . 
  talking . 
  whatever you say next is an ** absolute ** waste of energy . 
  its back and forth , they severely need manpower but they also want to become a professional and modern force . 
  start of 2013 he [ shoigu ] announced increased quotas then at the end he announced massive cutbacks to conscription etc, 
  giving them military training is the last thing you want , the terms of conscription is only for 12 months . 
  12 months of them being under control vs a lifetime now infused with military knowledge . 
  actually it only * assumes * that , the article they link to just says crimeans , it never mentions specific ethnicities . 
  http://www.cacianalyst.org/publications/analytical-articles/item/12835-russian-army-turns-down-conscripts-from-the-north-caucasus.html  in 2009 , the policy of rejecting chechen conscripts was unexpectedly expanded to other republics of the north caucasus , most profoundly to dagestan and ingushetia , and later to north ossetia , kabardino-balkaria , karachaevo-cherkessia and adygea . 
  russian military does n't conscript potential trouble making ethnicities , this * probably * wo n't affect the tatars . 
  edit : downvotes are for comments that do n't add to the discussion . 
  with the article being about the crimean population and military conscription i think that the fact russia excludes ethnicity 's considered a security risk is relevant to the discussion . 
  your assuming russia is an open democracy , putin likely controls election results + massive propaganda . 
  ^ ^ this , allowing naval and air force units to base there is of strategic importance in securing a northern atlantic trade route . 
  nominally they are the same , but purchasing power russia is 50 % larger economically . 
  egypt is n't a good example , look at turkey , their army has a constitutional right to ensure its upheld , they removed several parties that were turning the country unsecular . 
  only recently has the main party in power neutered the army 's power so that they could turn it islamic . 
  the military ** can ** be an answer , but the best answer is the people and to not vote in this lunatics . 
  28 % , there was only a 56 % turnout to vote . 
  they chose not to vote . 
  yup , we are paranoid pieces of shits , check boat saga . 
  same for australia . 
  did you see the images ? 
  its not just the plumbing , the entire place is in fucking shambles , nothings been spent on anything of note . 
  balmy 60 today , bloody beautiful weather !, 
  wanting independance is different to armed rebellion , executing fellow irishmen publically was the straw that broke the camels back . 
  parliamentary guards are usually only armed with pistols , assault rifles are fairly rare and usually only given to response units , but i do n't about ukraine specifically . 
  its built off of the eu , without it nations would n't have the will to commit to such an agreement . 
  but they do a lot fairly well , if your country is going to have just one plane then they are great . 
  they just are n't the best at air interdiction or fighter-bomber or stealth or carrier borne , they sacrifice to be able to do all 4 . 
  but with what 's been invested in them , it is better than the eurofighter/rafale . 
  budgets not an issue for third parties , they get fly away costs + a profit margin . 
  the usa takes the rnd costs , also only the vstol variants are having significant issues , the conventional model is working well . 
  thats exactly what `` value '' is , for its price , it simply is n't worth it compared to eurofighter/gripen etc. 
  its also lacking in bvr performance while not offering better dogfighting , only on par . 
   dera simulation `` in bvr combat , rating the f-22 at 91 % , the typhoon at 82 % , the f-15f ( single seat e ) at 60 % , the rafale at 50 % and the f-15c at 43 % . 
  the probability of a successful engagement can be translated into the more commonly used metric of a kill ratio by making some reasonable statistical assumptions , and doing this yields about 10.0:1 for the f-22a , 4.6:1 for the typhoon , 1.5:1 for the single seat f-15e , 1:1 for the rafale and 0.75:1 for the f-15c . '', 
  thats not to say its a bad plane , for being built by a single medium country and carrier borne , its very good , a testament to the french ... but its competition is better . 
  thats because the rafale is bad value , at least the gripen is very cheap with good qualities . 
  when australia took fa-18s they had override codes that only america had , we had hack them to remove them .

  racism involves thinking a group is * superior/inferior * and/or that they should be treated differently , this is just poor stereotyping imo . 
   ** should **, 
  your personal speech is not the same as a company 's . 
  corporations should not be treated as people . 
  just look at america with their 2nd amendment . 
   people do n't migrate to fields only 10 % of uk land has buildings on it . 
  did you have an imaginary conversation in your head and then only write the last sentence ? 
   you are counting only born overseas count born here to people who where born overseas also . 
  if 1 in 10 were born overseas than 9 in 10 were born in the uk , unless they can be born in some magic fairyland or alternate dimension ...  you statistics are stupid and so are you . 
  my statistics are factual and real , your grammar sucks and your comments are on whimsical tangents . 
   yes , they do n't let them in . 
  how about some facts . 
  one in four australians are born overseas , about 160.000 people a year migrate to australia for a country of 22 million , 0.7 % pa. 
  the united states has just over 1 in 10 born outside of the us , with about 1.000.000 a year migrating to the us , out of a country of 314million , thats 0.3 % pa. 
  the uk has 1 in 10 born outside of the uk with about 500.000 people a year migrating to the uk , out of a country of 63million , 0.8 % pa. 
  so australia has a far greater foreign born population with a similar contemporary immigration percentage while the united states has a similar foreign born population but less than half the current immigration per capita . 
   so up votes all around . 
  downvoting you because your factually wrong . 
  while uk immigration may be very high for its size , you need to improve your argument . 
  if you want to be matter of fact , a search of racism in my comment history only shows that single comment and now this one . 
  so if you 're going to quote a movie , at least using the actual context and meaning . 
  yeah , racism really seems to be coming out strong . 
  well fuck you too mate , its not like people can * gasp * travel , i spend almost no time ( unfortunately ) home but i 'm proud of where i come from . 
  flairs mean jack shit about what a persons knowledge is , thinking otherwise is just pure bigotry . 
  because yugoslavia does n't exist anymore . 
  you ca n't be a citizen to a non-existent country . 
  `` stripped from it '' implies that country still exists and only the individual was separated . 
  yeah , thats just sterotpying , racism has to have an implicit hatred towards the group . 
  i 'm not saying that will happen , who the fuck knows what anyone will do , but i 'm saying thats what ** they ** think . 
  knock out syria ( assad ) , no land war if israel strikes iran 's nukes , less catalyst events to iran going `` alright fuck you guys '' and screwing with the worlds oil . 
  `` due to his criticism regarding the scripted nature of the new exercise , van riper resigned his position in the midst of the war game . 
  van riper later expressed concern that the war game 's purpose had shifted to reinforcing existing doctrine and notions of infallibility within the u.s. military rather than serving as a learning experience . '', 
  i would n't put my money on it if the smart guy is saying they are n't learning from it . 
  to really secure the stait they will have to land troops and create a buffer zone so they ca n't launch crew served missiles , it will be very bloody to do that and the american people do not have the stomach for a costly war . 
  that paper also assumes you need anti ship cruise missiles to damage tankers , they do n't , you only need to make a small hole to make it all leak out . 
  because they pitched it navy vs navy when that will never happen . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_challenge_2002 just throw a bunch of missiles at them and they are screwed . 
  `` an equivalent success in a real conflict would have resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel . '', 
  also to close the strait they do n't have to physically close it , a crew served missile launched from hidden tunnels/caches/bunkers will cripple any tanker it hits , simply having the ability to do this is enough to stop them sending tankers through . 
  also this study looks at the effect to the us , its not about the us its about saudi arabia , if they close off its oil exports then their economy will crash , anarchy will ensure , no more saudi arabia exporting oil to the world . 
  israel has done nothing overt to influence the civil war * because if they do its war with iran , they have a mutual defence pact . 
  but if its america , iran is far less likely to go through with it , so its up to them if they want to keep israel from starting a giant war in the middle east . 
  which they will if iran has nukes , israel is n't going to sit on their thumbs waiting to be blown out of existence , they are going to destroy them with an air strike or their own nukes , if syria is no longer allied with iran then it would be easier for them and probably wont get dragged into a land war , also without syria on its side iran is less likely to push as hard for nuclear weapons if theres no one to counter an israeli strike . 
  its also not ** blaming ** israel , there does n't have to be someone at fault , everyones just out for their own interest , which is life . 
  i do n't think america has the political will to sustain the losses for it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennium_challenge_2002 `` an equivalent success in a real conflict would have resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel . '', 
  basically just throw a bunch of missiles at it from every angle and any fleet is fucked . 
  also a few men sneaking to the strait and launching a crew served missile would cripple any tanker . 
  if iran is smart they have several dozen tunnels and caches hidden for such an option , also suicide/bomb laden boats are another option . 
  but yeah , a land buffer is what 's needed but the time taken to do that the gulf oil states are going to be screwed plus massive impact on the world economy . 
  call your local mp . 
  they want assad out . 
  iran is going to get nuclear weapons , israel is going to strike at them or will be very eager to . 
  iran and syria have a mutual defence pact , if israel strikes iran its war with syria which makes the iranians more inclined to use them . 
  if iran goes to war they will probably shut down the strait of hormuz ( does n't take much ) , this will send the gulf oil states into anarchy , world oil shortage . 
  so yeah , syria ( assad ) is a lynchpin that encourages iran 's development and use of nuclear weapons and makes israel really scared . 
  while i agree thats the less bloody way its not what america wants , they want assad gone or all ties with iran severed , with iran soon to secure nuclear weapons and a mutual defence pact with syria , israel is going to feel very cornered and we know what they do when that happens which will drag the west in which will result in iran shutting down the strait of hormuz or flooding the oil market with their stores , either way it will result in gulf oil states falling into anarchy and subsequently cutting oil production in the entire region ... which is n't good .
