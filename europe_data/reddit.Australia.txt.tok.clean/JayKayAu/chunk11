  yes , i read about that . 
  apparently it 's also been discredited due to flawed methodology . 
  yes , that 's true . . 
  but the question is : do they have other papers to turn to ? 
  after all , what they 're arguing is false . 
  so they 'd have to essentially find another bunch of evidence that is also flawed . 
  does that evidence exist ? 
  the op is reluctant to say so , but i will : yes , our economy does indeed rely on excel . 
  so do most major corporations , most minor corporations , most medium-sized corporations , most governments , most ngos ... 
  almost everything has excel in there somewhere . 
  and that 's why we ca n't have nice things . 
  quite literally !, 
  this is a serious problem that gets in the way of economic growth , and introduces a * lot * of risk and unreliability all the way through our societies and economies . 
  but the good news is : we are pretty fault tolerant . 
  even though we have a billion little time-bombs , we are so big that we can absorb this and keep going . 
  that said , organisations that get themselves off excel and get serious about the way that they implement things are the organisations that tend to do very , very well . 
  there 's pressure for things to get better , and they slowly are . 
  so my advice : learn how to program , roll your sleeves up , and start solving these things . 
  you 'll make a comfortable income doing it too , 
  i think this question is figurative rather than literal . 
  i doubt anyone actually thinks the paper * directly * caused unemployment . 
  instead , i think the question is designed to have us think about what would have happened if these papers did n't exist , and therefore * did n't * serve as justification for austerity . 
  would people have questioned austerity earlier ? 
  would it have been harder to defend ? 
  easier to attack?indeed , would austerity have happened at all ? 
  and if austerity policies depend on these papers , and * had n't * have happened , then how many people 's jobs would still be there ? 
  for that matter , how many homes would n't have been wrecked ? 
  how much wealth would n't have been destroyed ? 
  how many suicides would n't have happened ? 
  how much damage could we have avoided ? 
  flawed comparison . 
  this does n't include non-married heterosexual families . 
  you guys brought shame to my country tonight :( well done , 
  what on earth are you talking about ? 
  the police are supposed to be * on your side * !, 
  if they are n't , guns are n't going to fix it . 
  right-wing extremists ? 
  and may those weeks be long and joyful !, 
  do n't forget that you 've also just moved into france 's biggest city . 
  the biggest city is alway much more impersonal than the rest of the place . 
  the 2nd biggest city is usually a better option . 
  wait ... this really happened ? 
  i thought that was just a figure of speech . 
  is there actually some footage of this ? 
  no , i 'm not lucky . 
  i 'm * entitled * to not be subject to violence . 
  haha , cool . 
  well i got called `` faggot '' on the weekend . 
  glad i do n't wear glasses , hey ? 
  do you have reason to think computer programmers are being targeted for violence because of what they do ? 
  the euro should have been structured such that france 's inefficiencies were it 's own problem , rather than a eurozone-threatening problem . 
  same goes for all of the eurozone countries : the euro is the problem here . 
  if it were working properly , then simple competition between the countries would cause them to reform themselves . 
  or on the other hand , the ski instructor could have taken 2 hours out of his valuable leisure time to obtain the french qualification . 
  which should be a cinch as he 's so well qualified in the uk , right ? 
  i disagree that it 'd do more to isolate anyone . 
  to the contrary , it is a formal acknowledgement that their society recognises them as having a legitimate right to do their thing without being targeted . 
  on your second point , [ affirmative action definitely works ] ( http://www.aclu.org/racial-justice/affirmative-action ) . 
  it genuinely helps to correct for structural biases . 
  but this case is nothing to do with affirmative action , so i do n't know why you mentioned it . 
  germany is only 27 years old ? 
  well , i stand corrected . 
  though it is unfair for the criticisms to be so belligerent and extreme , they did bring this upon themselves . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's an ugly , painful , stupid , slow , flawed , messy , human , frustrating , deeply important , and absolutely essential thing . 
  beautiful , though ? 
  gay men ? 
  as an australian , i found this quite funny . 
  `` the muslim issue '' ? 
  hmmm , sounds like racist bullshit to me . 
  reporting racism . 
   you do seem stupid enough ... lol , your radar 's faulty . 
   your statement that he was `` unbelievably profligate and wasteful '' is an outright lie do n't you remember the $ 34b cash bribe just before he lost the 2007 election ? 
  do n't you remember all of the middle-class welfare he dished out ? 
  peter costello famously fought with howard to constrain his profligacy . 
  and do n't you remember immediately prior to the gfc , we had inflation and interest rates that were far higher than they should have been ( which is a quantifiable way of showing that the government was spending too much ) ? 
  numbers do n't lie , buddy . 
  howard was a spendthrift . 
  does n't matter what the media was telling us ( all that rubbish about `` good economic management '' . 
   they are simply better at running the economy . 
  both labor and liberal are exactly the same on the economy . 
  they both take orders from treasury . 
  and treasury is good at running the economy \\* - they are the guys who deserve the credit . 
  not our stupid politicians and * definitely * not howard . 
  the liberals have this mystical aura of `` economic responsibility '' for no reason more deep than they like to hob nob with business types . 
  and business likes to think it knows how to run an economy . 
  mainly because they think running a business is the same as running an economy ( they 're related , but * not * the same thing ) . 
  as fo the rest of what you wrote , carry on troll . 
  \\* treasury dictates fiscal policy . 
  the reserve bank dictates monetary policy . 
  both of those organisations know what they 're doing , which is a big part of why our country is so prosperous . 
  [ if ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/us-infrastructure-behind-developed-world-2013-1 ) [ you ] ( http://www.cnbc.com/id/44610346/the_race_to_rebuild_america039s_infrastructure ) [ say ] ( http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/16/americas-mid-20th-century-infrastructure/ ) [ so ] ( http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/08/infrastructure ) . 
  and unfortunately the flip-side of that is that your basic services and infrastructure are crumbling and falling apart :(, 
  or conversely , how much tax is required to pay for everything you want and need . 
   except for our decision to return to surplus i 'm right with you on that one . 
  it was a very dumb promise to make , and i 'm glad they 've walked away from it . 
  actually , that 's not what happened . 
  our conservative pm , john howard was unbelievably profligate and wasteful during the boom times before the gfc . 
  instead of investing this surplus money into a sovereign wealth fund , he gave it all away in the form of ( unsustainable ) tax cuts and various other forms of imprudent middle class welfare .
