  i 'm not surprised . 
  piss off , troll . 
  the prize money is stuff-all compared to any country 's budget . 
  not even worth discussing . 
  as counterintuitive as that sounds , it 's a very , very good idea . 
  judging by every european i 've ever met , it * really * is n't . 
  `` i dare any social scientist show me a verifiable causal link between the eu and peace . '', 
  this guy is a fucking idiot , and clearly has n't the faintest clue how humans relate to eachother and why they cooperate . 
  i want to see the data on this . 
  how much capital has left ? 
  how much of it was productive ? 
  what is the corresponding benefit on the other side of the equation ? 
  simply saying '' ( some ) rich people are fleeing '' is not a good enough argument to judge whether this policy is beneficial or not . 
  i 've seen the same argument made here in australia : `` do n't tax the rich or they 'll go elsewhere and take jobs with them '' . 
  which is total rubbish and has n't happened at all . 
  some colossal value judgements in here . 
  if you 're relying on your family , then tough shit if your family 's poor . 
  there 's a reason it 's stable when your whole community contributes to your welfare . 
  why would you pick such a loser as a hero ? 
  fyi , `` reductio ad hitlerum '' is not an * actual * logical fallacy . 
  that is precisely the same logic and assumptions that drove anders breivik . 
   dealt with the problem how very third reich of you . 
  this is classic manipulation in practice . 
  it works like this : 1 . 
  come up with absolutely outlandish ideas that no one would support 2 . 
  attempt to get it through 3 . 
  opponents fight against the worst aspects 4 . 
  withdraw the proposal and reintroduce it with the worst aspects removed 5 . 
  attempt to get it through 6 . 
  repeat until you 've got the police state you wanted . 
  the only way i 've seen this kind of thing work is by creating such a hurricane of opposition that the idea becomes `` scorched earth '' . 
  this almost never happens , which is why the strategy is so tragically effective . 
  you 're nitpicking . 
  his point was that we consume far more energy than our bodies need . 
  yay !, 
  i win !, 
  as i asked before : why do we need to prioritise ? 
  is there a reason we should ignore the palestinian issue until worse problems are solved ? 
  can we not work on it at the same time as we work on other problems ? 
  is n't that kind of because it 's explicitly designed to be a deflationary currency ? 
  why do we need to prioritise ? 
  there are 7 billion of us . 
  are you saying we 're only capable of doing one thing at a time ? 
  so you 're saying that the palestinians should not complain about their mistreatment because other people have it worse ? 
  i know , but it 's interesting to see how far he can go with his line of argument . 
  are palestinians free from the fear of unjust incarceration ? 
  are they free from the fear of death ? 
  are they assured of being treated humanely ? 
  are they able to move about freely without impediment ? 
  because if not , then how can you say their predicament is trivial ? 
  are you arguing that the current predicament of the palestinians is trivial ? 
  as an australian , do n't make me return to the scene of the crime and kick your wimpy asses . 
  and when parachutes deploy properly , you get to the ground safely . 
  the issue here is what happens when there 's a failure . 
  that 's true . 
  tell me about it ... \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  australia is an island , a continent , and a country . 
  we are 100 % of the continent plus [ an island to the south ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tasmania ) , and a couple of tiny islands in the pacific . 
  new zealand is not on our continent , and it 's a different country , despite being very very similar . 
  also , ** we are actually the most gay-friendly continent on earth ** , contrary to what the article says . 
  the only remaining legal discrimination is gay marriage . 
  and something like 70 % of us think it should be allowed . 
  well conspiracy or not , the only relevant question is : is it the right thing to do ? 
  oh , i wish we could !, 
  it 's a ~ ~ similar ~ ~ worse situation here . 
  we have a [ huge housing affordability crisis ] ( http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com.au/2010/02/least-and-most-affordable-housing-in.html ) . 
  most people under 35 do n't expect to ever own a house near the city . 
  for example , i live in a 2-bed townhouse , decent quality , the kind a young couple would live it . 
  the reason is the baby boomers have bought up all of the houses because they get tax benefits ( called [ negative gearing ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/negative_gearing_ ( australia \\ ) #effect _ on_housing_affordability ) ) . 
  also our [ food is extortionate ] ( http://www.news.com.au/money/money-matters/australia-has-fastest-rising-food-prices-of-any-major-developed-nation/story-e6frfmd9-1225795572738 ) . 
  it 's seriously bad :( * edit : hey , maybe i should come and live in vienna ? 
  o.o oh my god europe is cheap !, 
  a decent baguette in australia costs ~ $ 5 ( 3.85 eur ), 
  ha , that 's actually not such a bad idea !, 
  yes they should have done this from the start . 
  but that does n't mean they should n't finally do it now . 
  well they would say that , would n't they ? 
  the way it works is this : 1 . 
  short term : use debt to stimulate the economy which increases tax takings and * increases your capacity * to repay debt . 
  medium term : wind back stimulus and * pay off the debt * . 
  long term : prosper , debt free . 
  implementing austerity in the middle of a crisis is hyper-stupid . 
  it is hugely contractionary ( strangles your economy ) and kills your ability to repay debt . 
  the middle of a crisis is where you need your economy to go as fast as possible to get yourself out of the mess , it 's not the time to self-flagellate and punish yourself for being a naughty boy . 
  that can ( and should ) come later , once you 're out of trouble . 
  aka , sarko is sabre-rattling to drum up votes . 
  welcome to australia !, 
  that is a false dichotomy . 
  please please please australia !, 
  it 's either that , or i have to marry someone to get an eu passport ... any takers ? 
  did you just use a `` z '' in apologise ? 
  i feel so sorry for the italians , having this douchebag in charge of the country . 
  here 's hoping they get rid of the bastard , and get their country back on some sort of track . 
  calm down . 
  if you have to have a monopoly , it * should * be run by the state . 
  then you need to make sure your state is running it properly , which is why you have elections . 
  kick the bastards out if they do n't run things properly . 
  you appear to be using the same language as those nutbags who look at a situation like this and think that the only solution is to privatise the damn thing . 
  which is pretty much the worst thing you could do . 
  you 've got a choice - either * properly * turn this into a competitive market ( like in japan - which is much harder to do than you think ) , or * properly * manage the system at a gov ' t level ( like in switzerland - which is also very hard to do ) .
