   one article posted in the past few weeks that was n't critical of russia . 
  why would that be necessary ? 
  if russia is out there doing good things , then these things would stand on their own two feet . 
  but if what they 're doing is so plainly self-interested and hostile to their neighbours and europe in general , then why should we be obliged to go on some sort of forensic expedition to dig up something positive to say ? 
  putin is being a cunt , and they deserve a lot of criticism . 
  if you want to figure out something nice to say ( for the sake of `` balance '' , or some shit ) then go ahead and waste your time . 
  does n't make the conversation any more productive though , i assure you . 
  it 's uncommon , but i would n't say it 's rare . 
   but that 's more of an armchair survivalist . 
  do n't worry , they all are . 
  oh excellent !, 
  that 's a great indicator that it might work !, 
   so obviously , if the french are so lazy and we are so productive , working hours ca n't be what is related to productivity . 
  at least not in the way most people seem to believe it is . 
  you 're actually right . . 
  productivity = output / hour , so if you can get the same output for fewer hours , then you 're more productive . 
  but for some reason ( ** cough ** neoconservatism ** cough ** ) , we 've incorrectly associated long working hours with productivity . 
  i 'm very glad that the northern europeans view this association with scepticism . 
  the `` right '' to shoot thieves is far from cut-and-dried . 
  that is effectively capital punishment that is being rendered without any form of judicial oversight . 
  to say that this is counter to the principles of civilisation would be a considerable understatement . 
  no , i 'm sorry , having someone try to steal some stock from a shop is no excuse for killing a human being . 
  the fact this happened should really be a wake up call to those racist assholes . 
  what 's the justification for retaliation ? 
  for availability and ubiquity . 
  nothing is worse than being out somewhere ( like a restaurant ) and your phone is running out of battery . 
  okay , let 's subsidise it then . 
  the cost will be negligible . 
   let 's rid ourselves of this 20th century cold war mindset reddit . 
  is n't the whole point of putin that he 's explicitly dedicating himself to reinvigorating the cold war mindset ? 
  if putin was n't acting like a child , this would n't even be an issue . 
  `` harsh clampdown '' is a euphemism . 
  euphemisms are bullshit and should not be in titles . 
  if there was an intention to use lethal force against a large number of people , why would `` planned to massacre '' not be an acceptable statement ? 
  if you have a better term , what would it be ? 
  well , if he 's really the tony blair of italy , then the answer will be no . 
  ( just like the kevin rudd of my country . ), 
  oi , we heard that !, 
  same in lyon . 
  freaked me out the first few times in the changeroom at the gym ... 
  how rich is `` rich '' ? 
   but there 's no such thing as ` true information ' , as the truth has to be put into a narrative for the news article , and that narrative can be skewed one way or another . 
  you 're right in the most rigourous sense . 
  but i think for practical purposes , it 's fairly easy to determine which information is utter rubbish and should probably not be printed . 
  i 'm perfectly okay with there being * some * bad information out there , because obviously some things are matters of opinion ( popular or not ) , some things are just unclear , and some things will be written from a particular perspective which i will disagree with , but it 's still true regardless . 
  but there are also matters of fact that can ( through simple fact-checking , like in the article above ) be shown to be totally wrong . 
  climate change denial , beating up on poor people , immigrants , asylum seekers with false information , etc , etc. . . 
  i think that exposure to the risk of liability would be a good thing , as it might just be the kick in the ass that publishers need to actually get their facts right . 
  the reason you 've come to this conclusion is you misunderstand the reason for freedom of the press . 
  the reason is that historically , information was handpicked , distorted , and delivered to you by the people in power ( government ) . 
  the principle of `` freedom of the press '' was born so that journalists , acting in the public interest , could print the truth without interference from the powerful . 
  the situation these days is completely and utterly inverted . 
  nowadays the press is much more powerful than the government is . 
  it 's the one distorting information . 
  it 's the one manipulating the truth . 
  if you 're clear-minded enough to recognise that accurate , true information is the goal here , then you 'll realise that `` freedom of the press '' is not the solution to the problem we 've got . 
  these days , if we want better quality information , then we are going to have to make sure you can be put to the fire if you lie to the public . 
  i , personally , am not sentimental about `` freedom of the press '' . 
  i see good , true information as the goal , and we should be intelligent and rational about ensuring that 's what we get . 
  if that means putting aside purist interpretations of the principle of `` freedom of the press '' , then let 's do it . 
  no , we are not going to `` get over this '' , because if we do that , we would be giving our tacit approval . 
  it 's only while this remains an issue , while politicians are forced to make gestures and statements , and ( hopefully ) have to show what they 're going to do about it at elections , will we have a chance of correcting this ridiculous state of affairs . 
  the fact that `` everyone 's doing it '' is absolutely not an excuse for it , nor a reason for us to roll over and play dead . 
  you 're making an argument that governments have to be pragmatic , which i do n't disagree with . 
  but the idea to `` get over this '' is something i will not accept . 
  how would you have expressed that in german ? 
  ouch . 
   due to it not holding up to what ? 
  conservative disapproval , or actual reality ? 
  if the latter , then i reject your claim entirely . 
  it 's plainly obvious that wealthy people get a free ride - i have to look no further than my parents who `` earn '' more money from their investments each month than i do actually working full time . 
  i do n't necessarily begrudge them that money , but they sure as fuck did n't earn it . 
   solve what problems ? 
  in what way would permiate solve an all-encompassing social welfare systems solve the problems of the present system ? 
  rather it 'd more them worse . 
  existence of poverty in that country , the poverty trap , administrative overhead , educational attainment problems , etc , etc , etc. . you know , all the problems that middle class people do n't have to worry about any more , but poor people do . 
   its not apologism , its the way the world actually works . 
  unless you try to breath some kidna common intelect and silimalr skills in people tehre will always be different socioeconomic groups , this simplye because because os scarce supply of skills inate to a limited amout of people . 
  you 're basically saying `` it 's inevitable , so why bother ? 
  '' , which is apologism . 
  i disagree that the * degree * of inequality is inevitable , i think much can be done , and inequality can be greatly improved . 
  what do you mean `` what 's my point ? '' ? 
  the way our economy works is a free lunch for anyone holding an investment . 
  that 's just how it goes . 
  who pays for it ? 
  ask karl marx - he wrote a book about who pays for that . 
  the idea behind a universal basic income is that that privilege is extended to every person in society . 
  and there 's fair reason to think that would a ) solve a whole bunch of problems in one go , and b ) be a hell of a lot simpler than the half-way effective social support system we 've already got . 
  as someone who cares about how the system works overall , and is not petty enough to care about bashing the poor to make myself feel like a big man , this strikes me as a very elegant solution that 's worth considering seriously . 
  `` there will always be different socioeconomic groups '' sounds a lot like apologism . 
  very dull , very uncreative , and frankly gets in the way of building better solutions . 
  you do realise that rich people are already these leeches you 're talking about ? 
  anyone who owns anything that generates interest or dividends is getting a free income . 
  but no one seems concerned that rich people are n't also working as well ( as most of them do ) . 
  so what , exactly , is the difference here ? 
  just like my landlord ... 
  yes , usually it 's defined as `` gdp contracted for two consecutive quarters or more '' . 
  but of course , there are different definitions . 
  most of them totally useless for the majority of people 's real lives which include things like `` employment '' - hence the utter uselessness of much of economics ... 
  which is kind of like saying that you had your leg amputated , but did n't bleed too much .
