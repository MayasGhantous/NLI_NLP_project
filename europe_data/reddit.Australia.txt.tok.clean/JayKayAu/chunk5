  in finnish , how do you say `` her/his '' ( possessive ) and `` her/him '' ( indicative ) ? 
  is there only one word in each case ? 
  well that 's disappointing , 
  well , that completely depends on the state of your economy . 
  if your problem is not enough private sector activity , then yes , it would . 
  but if your problem is that your infrastructure , health , education is slipping , then lowering taxes and cutting spending is the opposite of what you should be doing . 
  i think to many people fail to appreciate the * incredible * amount of economic growth government spending creates . 
  it 's huge . 
  but it 's often indirect ( e.g. , spending money to educate kids = better economy 20yrs later ) , and gets ignored . 
  your attitude , and the people who share it , are the # 1 reason why our economies keep failing to choose the correct economic policies . 
  what you think is cruel , wrong , and utterly , utterly , utterly stupid . 
  tell me , how are children born into poor families are going to be able to compete in an economy when they grow up ? 
  when their parents are struggling to feed , clothe , educate , and keep them healthy enough to actually have a chance ? 
  `` oh '' , you say , `` maybe they should have thought of that before they had children . '', 
  well , maybe they should have . 
  but what now ? 
  the kids are sitting there in front of you , and they 're not going to become doctors , lawyers or engineers unless * someone * bloody well makes sure they do not grow up in poverty . 
  `` well '' , you say , `` that 's their problem . '', 
  it certainly is . 
  but it also represents an * opportunity cost * for the whole economy . 
  how are you supposed to run a sophisticated , productive , first-world nation , where talented employees are available to fill the increasingly sophisticated jobs , if a huge chunk of your population grew up in poverty , because some thoughtless cad 20 years ago decided that `` rewarding '' people on welfare was just a little too much to stomach ? 
  the fact is this : policies that ensure that the poorest people in the nation are fed , clothed , housed , educated , and kept healthy , as well as given realistic paths to further education and employment have a ** positive return on investment ** for a nation . 
  this is a ** good investment ** . 
  if you are * still * silly enough to interpret this as a `` reward '' , you are also forgetting the counterfactual : if you took away welfare and redistribution , there would be a ** massive ** cost you 'd have to pay . 
  that cost is the money you spend on security guards , 12-foot concrete fences with broken glass on top , getting your car stolen , getting pick-pocketed , blah blah blah ... 
  if you 've ever been to a country without a welfare state , you 'd know what it looks like . 
  not as pretty as the countries that have welfare states . 
  ( put another way , that 's the difference between the 1st world and the 2nd/3rd world ), 
   ... our incessant drive to maximize security on behalf of liberty . 
  i think you meant to say : '' ... our incessant drive to maximize security * at the expense of * liberty '' . 
   the us became a powerhouse because it was founded on freedom , liberty , and equality . 
  that 's true-ish , but very redistributive economic policy ( moving money from the rich to the poor ) grew your middle-class to the biggest pool of educated , economically elevated people in the world . 
  that was a triumph , and every country that has done similar has also benefited . 
  this is not about `` force '' . 
  that may just shift the burden onto people 's families instead . 
  the overall effect is not necessarily a good one . 
  simple : you work out whether it 's disrespectful to black people , who as a whole , are in a weaker position within dutch society . 
  okay , fair enough . 
  i 've never been to a brothel . 
  but how could it shake your opinion on legalising sex workers ? 
  surely you agree that it 's better that this is done in the open , rather than underground ? 
  to be fair though , that 's what the inside of a strip club , or even a nightclub looks like too . 
  but even if we accept that these conditions are bad ( which i 'm happy to ) , that still does not provide any support for the idea that it should be * re * criminalised . 
  i imagine better regulation and inspections would be helpful . 
  i think that 's more a turn of phrase to indicate that the practice is now above-board rather than clandestine . 
  west-europeans are also the most likely to engage in a process of questioning themselves over whether they 're racist/intolerant . 
  that counts for quite a lot . 
  `` backup torches '' , hahaha ... 
  i remember another year it went out , and they took it into a van which was following the procession and relit it from `` the mother flame '' . 
  i.e. , a guy with a cigarette lighter, 
   it 's obviously not going anywhere you 're right , you are not persuading me . 
  because i still firmly believe that there should be a choice to go out peacefully , and no one has the right to take away that choice . 
  if there are doctors opposed to this because of the hippocratic oath , then they are welcome to be conscientious objectors . 
  but they should not interfere with this choice and force others to adhere to their restrictive ( and in my view cruel ) beliefs . 
   what about the obligation that euthanasia puts on medical professionals even though they may not wish to carry out the practice but are compelled to carry it out for their patient out of a sense of duty . 
  firstly , they can defer to another doctor . 
  how unbelievably inappropriate if they were to obstruct a patient 's / family 's wishes because of their own moral problems . 
  secondly , if they 're opposed to letting people choose to die peacefully , then they should absolutely not be working with terminally ill children . 
  thirdly , this is not about doctors and their religious beliefs . 
  this is about patients and giving them good , appropriate end-of-life care and options . 
  a professional should recognise that . 
  fourthly , again , you 're saying that rather than going peacefully , a person 's life ** has to ** be drawn out for those extra few days . 
  for what gain ? 
  at what cost ? 
  while the family watches the unconscious child 's body shrivel and deform until it finally gives out ? 
  i spoke two days ago to someone who lost their grandparent this way , and they said it was absolutely awful watching their body decay and collapse , day-after-day , for about 10 days . 
  ( because euthanasia is illegal in their country . ), 
  by opposing it , you are forcing your choice on other people . 
  and i think that 's abhorrent . 
   please do n't insinuate that i like to see people suffer i do n't think you want to see people suffer . 
  i think you misunderstand how much suffering there is in the last few days of someone 's life . 
  not just for the patient , but for the family . 
  you are denying people 's right to choose a good death . 
  how can you possibly justify taking that choice away ? 
  if a child is dying of cancer , and the last few days will be messy , torturous and painful , i can see no justification for cruelly prolonging this state . 
  it is keeping people alive , no matter how much horror you 're creating , just so that you can satisfy some perverse desire to keep them alive . 
  this is the most awful cruelty you can commit against a dying person . 
  because , ** you ** are deciding , against the wishes of the child , against the wishes of the family , against the advice of doctors and nurses , that they ** can not have a choice ** , and that they ** must ** die in this horrid , prolonged fashion . 
  how fucking dare you take that choice away ? 
  but i think you 're missing the point . 
  no one disagrees that appropriate safeguards have to be in place . 
  but that 's not what this discussion is about . 
  the real problem for most people is that in their countries * there is just no option for euthanasia * . 
  we need it ** now ** , to save people from unnecessary suffering . 
  the point of the article is that this 86-year-old couple simply did not have this option in france , and they had to do it in a fashion which was secretive and illegal . 
  it should be legal and done openly . 
  with their families present . 
  until we 've got an option for legal euthanasia , we have a serious , widespread , and real suffering going on . 
  rather than a rare , theoretical problem of someone requesting euthanasia when they `` should n't '' . 
  let 's not hold up legal euthanasia by dithering around with semantics ( which are widely solved anyway ) . 
   where do you start drawing the line an important discussion does need to take place over where this line goes . 
  however , 100 % of people are going to die . 
  most of them due to extreme old age , and in those cases , can be kept alive for just a little bit longer through medical intervention ( is n't medicine amazing these days ? ) . 
  this process is basically prolonged torture , and it is extremely inhumane . 
  you would never do that to an animal , but we are routinely doing this to our elderly . 
  or we could have euthanasia , so that when it 's clear that you 're on your very last legs , the process can be quick , painless , and can be done with your family there by your side . 
  this should be the # 1 consideration . 
  now , you 're introducing a question about edge cases . 
  cases that will occur in the * minority * . 
  i 'm completely in favour of having this discussion .
