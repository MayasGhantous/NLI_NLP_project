  but first , we need to have legal euthanasia , and we need it now . 
  i do not want to see more torture going on while people sit around talking about where we `` draw the line '' . 
  it 's interesting to me how a study shows something that some people do n't want to hear , because of their biases , and they 're willing to just dismiss it outright . 
  many people want to believe that the unemployed are inherently lazy and opportunistic because if that 's true , then it 's their own fault and we do n't need to do anything about it . 
  ( talk about lazy and opportunistic ! ), 
  the truth of the matter , of course , is somewhat different . 
  as this study shows . 
  people who fetishise work and `` achievement '' at the expense of nearly everything else of value . 
  haha , i was thinking of gerard depardieu when i wrote the previous message . 
  what a wanker . 
  apparently he moved to russia , and putin made him the cultural attach\u00e9 to siberia or something . 
  in general though , i 'm very sure that this `` capital flight '' idea is simply a bluff to scare governments away from collecting taxes from the wealthy . 
   if you work for less than 2500.-chf , they only pay you whatever is left between your salary and 2500 . - chf oh , this was not my understanding . 
  i thought this was 2500 chf that every single person automatically receives , regardless of their employment conditions . 
   i guess you could raise taxes , but then part time jobs would earn you less as well , making you think twice before you give into them . 
  i imagined taxes would go up , but moreso for the wealthy ( i.e. , in a progressive fashion ) . 
  so for people in the middle and above , it would n't really make much difference at the end of the day . 
   you could also tax the rich more heavily , but they 'd just leave switzerland . 
  that 's not really true . 
  rich people always say that , but i 'm ** deeply ** sceptical that this actually happens in reality . 
  ( particularly in a way that would actually disadvantage the country . ), 
   and if you just give 2500 . - chf to people with jobs that pay less than 2500 . - chf and let them keep their salary , it would be most unfair : you could go work for 2400.-chf and get paid the same as a guy who goes to work for 4900 . - chf . 
  under my previous understanding , the guy who went to work for 4900 chf would now get 7400 chf ( minus any applicable tax increases ) , so that would n't be unfair to him . 
   i 'm not assuming they are inherently lazy ... 
  i understand what you 're saying about having a negative incentive if the gov ' t only provides you the difference between what you earn and 2500chf/mo . 
  in that case it would n't be lazy , it 'd be rational . 
  but under my previous understanding , there would be no such negative incentive . 
  it would always be positive , so there 'd be no reason not to work more for more money . 
   i have absolutely no need of the money it would lighten the financial burden on your parents and/or it would allow you to save money to buy a house/investments or start some sort of project , etc. . .  anyone doing a job that pays below 2500 . - chf monthly would just quit ... well , except that working would earn you even more money which you could do things with . 
  the financial incentive to work still exists . 
  for example , someone on $ 60k/yr still has an incentive to work hard to upgrade to an $ 80k/yr job . 
  you do n't need to be on the edge of poverty for the financial incentive to be there ( just look at ceo salaries ! ) . 
   no one would want to do the dirty work anymore . 
  which would increase demand for workers , and thus salaries for workers , and thus increase people 's interest in taking the jobs . 
  but separately , there 's an unspoken assumption you 're making - that people are inherently lazy and would mostly choose to work less rather than earn more . 
  i do n't think this is true . 
  i think people will always want a bit more than they have , if it 's possible to get it . 
  also , i think that people at the lower-end would probably have better chances at getting into better work ( because they can take bigger risks , like investing years into education , for example ) . 
  that should increase the overall labour-market efficiency in the country . 
  that 's pretty good actually . 
  if you were not careless , that 's enough to have a simple life . 
  and it would really free you from the fear of failing at getting a better job , starting a business , etc. . 
  i really wish you guys would pass this so we could see what happens . 
  it 's 2500chf per what ? 
  per month ? 
  no , but it does typically afford you `` safe passage '' . 
   theft and espionage or whistleblowing , which is a political crime , if it 's a crime at all . 
  it 's very easy to make a case ( indeed , it 's obvious ) that snowden has done this in the interests of society . 
  the amount of action and reform which has happened as a result is remarkable . 
  his persecution by the us is clearly politically motivated , and that is certainly a plausible grounds for seeking asylum . 
  my point being : you ca n't claim he has no grounds , as it is easy to make a case for why he may have grounds . 
  the english term for this is `` defrocked '' , which is utterly hilarious and brings to mind some sort of cruel punishment on the tv show ru paul 's drag race . 
  in many countries ( including mine ) , there 's a `` pecuniary interest register '' , where all mps have to declare everything they own , including houses , companies , stocks , etc. . . 
  does such a thing not exist in sweden ? 
  that would be a spectacular misreading of what i said . 
  probably should n't have screwed the working classes , thatcher-style , for so long then , hey ? 
  nothing like an uneducated , disenfranchised , socially-excluded class to offer stiff competition to motivated foreigners . 
  it is not his place to decide this information is not `` socially responsible '' to release . 
  on the contrary , i think it 's obvious that these releases are the social responsibility that has been lacking for so long . 
   paxman did plenty of that . 
  no he did n't . 
  he was too busy throwing intellectually half-arsed criticisms to try and trip brand up . 
   a question can not be a strawman it ** absolutely ** can . 
  the strawman here is `` revolution '' and the connotations that come with it . 
  brand eventually conceded this point , but i do n't think he needed to or should have . 
  his point was that the systems we 've got in place do not adequately address the problems we 've got , and that they are structurally unable to . 
  thus , we will need to change the structure and composition of these systems themselves in order to get the changes we need . 
  that does n't necessarily mean `` revolution '' , or anything with quite such heavily negative connotations . 
  bref , paxman is intellectually lazy . 
  even if brand 's ideas are unorthodox ( which i do n't necessarily believe personally ) , paxman made no attempt to explore or characterise brand 's ideas . 
  the only trick in his meager little box of skills was to create totally absurd strawmen ( e.g. , `` so you want a revolution ? 
  '' ) , rather than to devine exactly what kind of problems brand thinks are worth solving , and the way they 'll be solved . 
  such a horrifyingly poor interviewer . 
  brand 's humour was the only thing that saved the interview from bombing entirely . 
  it 's very human , is n't it : do n't care until it affects you directly . 
  so given that inevitability , let 's be thankful that it 's finally affected her ( and other leaders ) personally . 
  i think it 's more that now the information is out in the open , foreign countries can use it a leverage to take action that they otherwise could n't . 
  even though they would 've been fully aware of it the whole time . 
  do n't be so relativist . 
  violence and aggression are not okay , no matter what your political ideology . 
  yes , ` friends ' spy on ` friends ' . 
  no , racist is when you show people * less respect * because they 're different . 
  you do n't have to go anywhere as far as hate to be racist . 
   but not for religious reasons how is it possible to justify inequality under the law ? 
  i 've never heard a single argument opposing legal equality that did n't boil down to either `` i do n't like gay people '' , or `` because it 's against my religion . '', 
  neither of which are valid reasons ( particularly in a secular country ) . 
  if this were a systematic issue , i 'd agree with you . 
  but in this case , it 's better to have an uncorrupted police force than it is to risk a few extremists being unemployed . 
  never . 
  this is not an excuse for unauthorised spying , no matter what the outcome . 
  this group should have been under legal , transparent , fully-authorised surveillance . 
  there 's a place for that . 
  but not unauthorised spying . 
  your title was good . 
  thanks for that . 
  remember that any oganisation can have different parts that do not know about eachother . 
  in this case , the media report would have brought this to the awareness of parts of the police that then filed a report on the part that created the database . 
  this is actually an amazingly good outcome . 
  in many other countries , they would have tried to suppress or downplay this . 
  right , but if they do n't outlaw golden dawn , then they would be tacitly allowing them into parliament , close to the levers of power .
