  i completely agree that the underlying causes need to be addressed , but i think it 's good that they 're arresting the progress of this group towards power . 
  many things need to be done . 
  this is one of them . 
   ... balls deep in a rentboy . 
  thats a turn of phrase i can really get behind . 
  ... jon snow . 
   anti- ( belief system ) racism this is linguistic nit-picking . 
  in australia we would simply call it `` anti- ( belief system ) discrimination '' . 
  it 's real . 
  deal with it . 
  oh god . 
  i think i 'm going to go and cry for a while . 
  oh god . 
  just fuck everything about that . 
  it makes me so upset . 
  yes , we need that word . 
  true , but remember that home airconditioning is relatively new ( popular in the last 10/15yrs ) , and even in a very young country like australia , most housing stock is older than that . 
  that said , most new homes have better insulation and often built-in reverse-cycle aircon . 
  is there any language on earth that has a word that encapsulates the feeling of tragedy/sympathy for the affected + knowing that this was exactly what was going to happen the whole time + frustration that this was obvious and ignored . 
  if such a word does n't exist , we should create it . 
  because we need it now . 
  hence #firstworldproblems, 
  the houses we 've got ( particularly in the hot , northern states ) are actually built to lose as much heat as possible . 
  because it 's bloody hot most of the time . 
  so for the two weeks of the year \\* that it 's cold , we tend to chuck a tanty and have a bit of a whinge . 
  \\* slight exaggeration, 
  no idea how we 'll get down either . . 
  it 's scary up there . 
  the largest fund of what kind ? 
  what the hell is a catboy ? 
  in australia , there 's no scarcity of housing , but instead we have an `` affordability crisis '' . 
  because all of the houses , particularly the cheaper houses , are being bought up by investors including baby-boomers who own a 2nd or 3rd house , which drives the prices up . 
  it makes it nearly impossible for young people to buy their first house , which is creating * huge * issues . 
  so i wonder if the netherlands have a similar problem : the houses are there , but they are unaffordable ? 
  no , that 's about right . 
  there really are a * lot * of gay people around . 
  there was a 1-in-10 statistic bouncing around ( probably because it 's a catchy number ) , but i think that 's a bit on the high side . 
  but the above argument is completely correct . 
  there are many homosexual people who would not put their hand up and be counted as gay : children ( obviously ) , older generations ( who might 've been gay but got married and had kids anyway ) , people who are culturally unlikely to express it ( e.g. , middle-eastern or asian cultures ) , and people from homophobic families/communities . 
  so yes , the number of actual homosexuals ( probably 4 ~ 5 % ) is likely to be significantly higher than the number who would identify as such ( ~ 1.5 % ) . 
  wait ... is gay divorce legal yet ? 
  opportunity and yes , in other countries there has been a spike . . 
  i wonder what makes france different ? 
  yes , that is a bit low . 
  still for many gay it 's not really about wanting to marry . 
  it 's about gay people wanting the * right * to marry . 
  that 's the important thing , at the end of the day . 
  how many straight couples got married during the same time ? 
  in the article it says that roughly 5 % of marriages in that period were same-sex . 
  that sounds about right . 
  the headline of this article may be trying to stir up controversy where it does n't exist . 
  imagine that . 
  i absolutely hate it when people make that argument . 
  that and the `` we 've always known this happens '' argument . 
  cravenness . 
   ... you do n't have the right to not be offended ... 
  this is not a right that exists anywhere \\* , and no one takes this concept seriously . 
  this is a strawman argument used by nasty people to defend nasty things they 've said . 
   ... with the politically correct crowd . 
  again , this is a strawman . 
  these people do not exist , and if they do , no one cares . 
  if some idiot thinks `` black holes '' are a racist term , then the problem is you have an idiot on your hands . 
  not some great `` politically correct '' conspiracy . 
  no , the problem is this : there are people who do not understand/appreciate/recognise that their speech is damaging to other people . 
  not just `` offensive '' , but actually * damaging * . 
  and they get unreasonably upset when people point out that they 're hurting other people . 
  for example : when people run around equating gay people with `` sin '' , or `` corruption '' , or `` bestiality '' or `` pedophilia '' , this does much more than * offend * people . 
  it does real and substantial harm to young people in particular . 
  i do n't know if you 're gay or not ( and have this experience ) , but a great many gay people will report having struggled very seriously with the trauma of social exclusion - which is generated by anti-gay speech and bullying . 
  ( indeed , it 's the * point * of anti-gay speech and bullying . ), 
  this trauma is real , substantial , and very damaging . 
  this is n't about some `` offensive '' affront to one 's delicate sensibilities , this is much more serious than that . 
  that 's why your use of the following is rubbish : - the right to not be offended - politically correct crowd - `` being offended '' appears to be a new pastime - some segments ( ah , the good old `` some people '' trope ) this is all nonsense . 
  we have real problems where people are suffering real hurt , and the american approach is `` tough shit , freedom of speech , ` murica !, 
  '' , while another approach is `` no , that 's not protected speech . 
  you are responsible and liable for what you say . '', 
  as i said before , you 're entitled to your approach . 
  but do n't make the mistake of thinking it 's the only valid approach . 
  \\* ^ ( actually , i lie : it does exist in one place i know of - it is illegal to insult or offend the royal family in thailand , and this law is actually enforced . 
  but this is the kind of exception that proves my point . 
  it 's ridiculous to expect to not be offended . ), 
  i just want to point something out that our american friends sometimes forget : * absolute * freedom of speech is * not actually a good thing * . 
  freedom of speech is * generally * , most of the time , under normal circumstances , a wonderful thing . 
  yay , let 's all be free to say what we want !, 
  we definitely want to be standing on the * freedom * end of the spectrum . 
  the other end of the spectrum ( like north korea ) is not a pretty place . 
  not at all . 
  anyone from a developed country would agree with this . 
  freedom is mostly a great thing . 
  *** but *** be very , very , * very * careful when you decide to do something * absolutely * , with no exceptions . 
  when you push this idea of `` freedom '' of speech * to the extreme * , you start to get some very , very nasty problems pop up . 
  some examples : - alice copies bob 's work , and sells it as if it were hers . 
  ( copyright ) - bob claims charlie is a child molester . 
  ( defamation , slander ) - charlie sells dianne fake artwork claiming it as original ( counterfeiting ) - diane runs a business and knowingly misleads her customer , ernie . 
  ( trade practices ) - ernie hates a minority group , and organises anti-minority rallies against them . 
  ( hate speech , incitement ) if we have * absolute * freedom of speech , you can never solve these problems . 
  ever . 
  people can cheat , lie , and slander , and incite with absolute impunity . 
  * absolute * freedom means that there are * no ( legal ) consequences * . 
  because if you 're free to do anything , then the law has nothing to say .
