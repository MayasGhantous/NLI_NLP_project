well when it comes to sick political bants in australian politics , you can not beat paul keating , pm . 
  [ link . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpgflsceknq ) when asked why he would not call an early election , he responded that `` because mate , i want to do you ( the opposition ) slowly ... 
  there 's got to be a bit of sport in this for all of us . '', 
  bird extermination . 
   australia  some minuscule island [ biggest island , you mean !, 
  phwoar that 'd shake up our politics a fair bit . 
  i 'd be keen for some sweet schengen , myself . 
  not very good photo 's , you ca n't see any of the fog through all that bloody smoke . 
  is he the chap who stole that pen on camera ? 
  banter, 
  not very often , though . 
  uk is too relevant to be `` northern europe '' , tbh . 
  oi watch it , gr\u00fcber, 
  news to me mate . 
  it 's not like drunken , rowdy kids would particularly stand out in this country tbh, 
  i agree , it shows a disappointing amount of moral apathy . 
  christ on a bike ... 
  us pls ladm8, 
  you are mad my highly educated friend , just look how beautifully geometric that rectangle is . 
  [ only in the new world can you find borders more pleasing to the eye !,

  we 're all gon na make it brah, 
  it 's short for `` cha ching '' which as we all know is the international sound of money , and which the swiss have always been fascinated by . 
  wwii is pretty well taught , we must all already know i guess . 
  though i 'm sure it 's a welcome change for the germans from all the warcrime reminders haha . 
  perhaps , but in more relatable terms , would you rather people asking `` why are you not rich ? '', 
  or `` why on earth are you still alive ???? '', 
   not part of spain oh man , the attacks are relentless and from every direction . 
  our portuguese friends can not catch a break, 
  seems like a lot of overly cynical , inaccurate garbage from everyone there . 
  reads like a pravda.ru comment section to be honest . 
  life is suffering, 
  nah mate , just do it !, 
  average life in london would be interesting, 
  well i could lend a hand if it 's on a tuesday or weekend . 
  pretty sure they built our high quality [ helicopter carriers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canberra-class_landing_helicopter_dock ) m80, 
  oi watch it, 
  wtf but they 're not even in eurovision , where 's our invite ? 
  it looks like some bloke 's stolen a pagani 's headlights and put them onto a bucket, 
  density of bears depends on proximity to russia , apparently , haha, 
  seems pretty noice . 
  so does this mean we get cheaper renault 's and mercs ? 
  sibelius is one of my favourites tbh , especially king christian ii suite . 
  it 's pretty comfy, 
  is it true that if you ai n't dutch , you ai n't much ? 
  i like it when cartoonists try not to litter their cartoons with obvious tags and labels . 
  it looks like a tacky ben garrison comic when they go over the top tbh, 
  that story of the russian on the plane chatting to the american is just brilliant . 
  every french i 've met in real life has said exactly this to me for some reason . . 
  he 's being sarcastic . 
  / u/executivemonkey is always being sarcastic . 
  whistle blowing ? 
  they 'll let any sport in these days ... 
  they can indeed try ; ^ ), 
  this sort of bravado talk over an internet commenting site in the comfort of your own home in relative peace is fucken cheap mate . 
  really cheap . 
  very unfair on chamberlain there . 
  he made the best decision with the information he had at the time with the aim of staying out of the sort of war seen 20 years prior , and was the one who declared war in the end . 
  even churchill thought so , '' `` whatever else history may or may not say about these terrible , tremendous years , we can be sure that neville chamberlain acted with perfect sincerity according to his lights and strove to the utmost of his capacity and authority , which were powerful , to save the world from the awful , devastating struggle in which we are now engaged ... . '', 
  thank you lad edit : nice to be appreciated . 
  the whole country now operates on a 1:2 scale , as in everything is half the size , and the clocks are now running in metric . 
  probably easy for europe to apply to canberra . 
  much less paperwork , i 'd imagine . 
  we should do that instead, 
  thank you for the advice tovarishch in that case we 'll have to get [ tony baloney ] ( http://pedestriantv-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images%2farticle%2f2015%2f02%2f06%2f88cfb2c8-69e5-4aae-aab5-eb702ee044d0-tone3.jpg ) in again then haha, 
  mmm this is disappointing to hear that i 've been lied to . 
  i 'm sure i 've told a couple of people about the dutch and their silly napoleonic surnames . 
  this is correct , you lads forced our hand when you said that only europeans can join . 
  so we did this, 
  but we eastern imperialist now !, 
  and the rest are thin , bearded and sarcastic, 
  do n't be too hard on yourself man ; ^ ) nah it 's [ this bloke ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0091035/?ref_=tt_cl_t5 ) from [ the bridge ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1733785/ ), 
  the sarcastic fat one with the beard, 
  the great hunger though . 
  great !, 
  it 's not like it was called the national tummy rumble . 
   the same england who once had a company so big , it was actually worth more than the entire country , because it was a giant pyramid scheme ? 
  what are you referring to here ? 
  east india trading company ? 
  sounds interesting, 
  i wonder what this means for holden in australia , considering the commodores manufactured here were going to be imported opels from next year . 
  would 've been interesting what a french owned holden would 've changed tbh, 
  queenie and her sprogs like to pop round here for a wave every now and then , which can not be understated . 
  note that the indonesian navy has been expanding recently coincidence ? 
  these days , anything less than a declaration of total war could be perceived as weakness . 
  interesting points . 
  is what merkel says about planning bottlenecks holding back infrastructure development rather than investment true ? 
   schulz hinted that he would use germany 's financial clout to push solidarity within the eu , particularly on issues such as taxes , migration , security and defense . 
  those first two sound like potential for some minor discomfort east of the oder tbh . 
  really cool work , mate . 
  the moroccan one somehow makes me feel like i should be searching for [ wally ] ( http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7c4bba5b55eb8555de525211b9da7a8e ) . 
  [ commemoration of the football streaker ] ( http://www.heatheronhertravels.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/at-memento-park-near-budapest.jpg ), 
  it 's a shame about the original palace but erich 's version looks pretty cool tbh . 
  shame they could n't both exist, 
  or even australian federation !, 
  just in time for the negotiations , too !, 
  castle ? 
  mate , the only armies those walls are going to stop are armies of fat tourists , if the hill does n't get them first . 
  would n't last 10 seconds against my trebuchet .
