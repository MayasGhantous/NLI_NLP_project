  please do n't try to show off with all your latin skills . 
  it does n't take ciceronian eloquence or intelligence to compose in latin . 
  your trying to come at me with latin is also perhaps the most euphoric thing i 've ever seen . 
  you are literally a stereotype . 
  yea cos that 's what i was trying to do ... 
  you do realise poland was jointly invaded by nazi germany and the ussr , technically poland was invaded by the axis and the allies at the same time ... france and england declared war on germany . 
  holy scripture & teachings = constitution & law/justice high priest = president church = government priests = politicians etc. 
  haha , it still counts , but archaeology is more like forensics than history . 
  fair point , but i do n't think the victims of any atrocity would care about the symbolic discrepancies between atrocities ... that seems to be a point that people who were n't directly affected by an atrocity often propagate . 
  oh , allied committed atrocities during and after the war so the ` recent history ' thing does n't really stick . 
  if you want to say the consequences of the nazis were different i wo n't disagree , they were obviously unique but the problem is really how people are addressing the concept of ` atrocity ' . 
  also , i think it 's detrimental to focus on the unique consequences of nazism and ignore the unique consequences of the rest , you know ? 
   when/if you reply please do n't forget that i 'm still against nazism and what not . 
  i know , i said so too . 
  actually * all parties * involved started the war , if you honestly believe that the nazis are solely responsible then i respectfully recommend studying some history and archaeology a little bit more . 
  seriously , even ` mainstream ' historians are refraining from pointing the finger at solely germany because of post-wwi conditions and the treaty of versailles ... not to mention the economic colonial/trade war over north africa that the british and french have a lot to answer for in terms of provocation , but that 's not really talked about because bad propaganda . 
   add in a little genocide , and yeah , i 'd say they were exceptionally malicious . 
  yea but britain starved and murdered 25-60 million indians between 1870-1945 so ( not just from that famine , but political killings ) ... then there 's africa , which is * way worse * ... france has a big part in that one too ... when/if you reply please do n't forget that i 'm still against nazism and what not . 
  i respect your opinion and everything but  imperialism was not systematic , industrialized ethnic cleansing . 
  it 's a difference worth noting . 
  sure , but i think imperialism , totalitarianism and all that jazz are part of a religious system ... statism ... ethnic cleansing is just one of many horrors within that system . 
  that 's how i see it at least , obviously i support condemnation but the inconsistency by the condemners annoys me because it eats out of the hands of contemporary political powers ... :(, 
  people are stupid to think that the nazis were exceptionally malicious lol , that flag represents the same fucked up bullshit that * the union jack , trois couleurs , soviet or red-white-blue-murrica * . 
  how many indians , africans and asians died and suffered thanks to the british in the 20th century ? 
  a fuckton more than the nazis did jews ... anyone for that matter , are people offended by britain 's flag ? 
  no , because britain won the war and they 're the good guys and all their propaganda should be treated as 100 % fact . 
  lol, 
  rome, 
  like none . 
  because the sub 's picture of the map is square ... to fit into the side panel ... 
  europe needs less nanny state bullshit ... 
  draw a penis on the ballot sheet !, 
  `` yea '' and `` nah '', 
  well putin is definitely right if you regard this subreddit ... 
  if each millionaire in the eu donated like 20 $ ... not to mention if other wealthy citizens donated something under 5 $ ... 
  governments are machiavellian plots, 
  if you were gay , you 'd want it to be legal . 
  why ca n't people who disagree do their own thing , why does a gay person who wants to get married have to consult you or care about what you think ? 
  you can have your opinion but other people should n't have to give a fuck . 
  j'aime bien manger du cazzo per pranzo e cena sed p\u0113nis c\u016blum \u012bnserit * i am 12 years old and what is this *, 
  hey , you wan na know what pro-western propaganda feels like ? 
  how can we stop it ? 
  l'autoritarisme grandit quotidiennement \u00e0 travers le monde, 
  well fuck me i think this sub-reddit might be infested with 'em briternet manipulation, 
  panarchy ? 
  this is a silly statement , however i think its report and subsequent responses are intended to trivialise the fact that most of the ukrainian oligarchy * is actually jewish * , which means there is some truth in these words ... 
  i see a lot of comments making jokes about russian propaganda , which is fair enough , but i only saw one comment address the fact that the majority of ukrainian oligarchs are jewish ( and with downvotes ) ... 
  i think it 's behaviour like this that fuels zionists conspiracy theories more so than the demographic facts pertaining to jewish people . 
  ` natural ' means ` like nature ' , and nature ( naturus ) is the future participle of ` nascor ' , which means to be born/spring forth . 
  nature literally means ` that which is about to be born ' . 
  considering that homosexuals * have been born * and obviously * will be born * in the future , they are definitely natural . 
  no ... hahahaha, 
  private wealth * the region itself is definitely not wealthier than europe, 
  only in ` private financial wealth ' ... pfft . 
  does this mean i will be able to buy greek land/assets for peanuts ? 
  is this supposed to be a surprise ? 
  i thought there was an obvious export/import relationship ... 
  we should use latin instead . 
  auxiliary languages should be accurate and precise in terms of communication ( english lacks this significantly in comparison to latin ) , native languages should be whatever they want to be . 
  oligarchy, 
  usa 's , uk 's , france 's , germany 's and that of the rest of the democratic world seems to be fooling plenty . 
  become ? 
  military is becoming obsolete , warfare is drastically changing . 
  both sides are funding both sides, 
  you 'd love italy for their rule following, 
  huh ? 
  i do n't know if i misunderstood you but i did n't say anything about ` direct democracy ' . 
  what we call ` democracy ' is an oppressive combination of * ochlocracy * ( mob rule ) and * psephocracy * ( ballot elected bureaucracy ) . 
  in fact , we technically call it ` representative democracy ' because literal democracy is only practiced in isolated communities ( tribal , communitarian etc. ) . 
  literal democracy is n't even that good anyway , what most people think they want when the say ` democracy ' is * isocracy * , but that would put politicians and governmental bureaucrats in an awkward position . 
  http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ochlocracy ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ochlocracy ) http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/psephocracy ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ballot - the old wikipedia page for it has fused with this ) http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/isocracy ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/isocracy ) politically speaking , ` democracy ' is blatant * doublespeak * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doublespeak, 
  uh i think he was referring to the greek politicians he had to deal with as opposed to greek people ... 
  lol , that 's why they 're inhumane , because people are forced to stay , they ca n't even legally leave because their home country is either in some kind of situation where diplomacy is unattainable or they 're in a position where they will be murdered , enslaved or put an even more inhumane position . 
  you make camps they get stuck there until they die or get granted asylum . 
  i recommend convincing libya , algeria or one of those sparsely populated mediterranean states to create a small autonomous municipality in an uninhabited region that is partly controlled by the eu , so the eu can waste it 's millions into developing and protecting a city for refugees instead of giving it to corrupt government officials in europe , africa or the mid east . 
  we have concentration camps for them ... 
  `` it 's also a german temple '' haha !, 
  i do n't have any problems , i just asked you a question 2 . 
  fair point , but you are bragging about your sexuality , you 're now bragging about the fact that your sexuality is unknown . 
  and do you think you 're not bragging about your sexuality right now ? 
  you 've made it pretty evident that you 're a heterosexual and definitely have made a public display ... 
  why ? 
  because you do n't like it ? 
  why should people not be able to brag about who they have sex with ? 
  if you find it offensive/annoying/gross why ca n't you just ignore it ? 
  homosexuals have to tolerate and ignore heterosexuals bragging about their sexuality constantly . 
  technically macedonian slavs are also ethnically descendants of both ancient greeks and east roman greeks . 
  also , ethnic ` greek ' did n't really exist until quite recently ... 
  cultural revolution 1 . 
  promote unorthodox families ; single , gay , elderly , polyamorous etc. 
  make childcare easier somehow , provide more support 3 . 
  make it easier to have unconventional children outside of the womb , some women would be more inclined to have a baby if they did n't have to mutate their body for 9 months , affecting their health and work/life/time . 
  also , promote funding into same-sex fertilisation ( yes it 's possible , just not endorsed , google it ) . 
  italy will see civil unions soon enough : /, 
  `` succeed is what the spanish left does '' yea , sure ... tell that to el generalissimo ... 
  sigh , fascism is a political system , not a synonym for totalitarianism a fascist state can hypothetically be ` liberal ' , fascism is about political corporatism more than anything . 
  the atrocities committed by hitler , mussolini , franco , pinochet etc. 
  were no different to * democratic * british prime minister 's or american and french presidents ... 
  in fact , since wwii ended * every * state has adopted fascist policies , and since the cold war ended , it escalated dramatically . 
  fascism is merely * national corporatism * .
