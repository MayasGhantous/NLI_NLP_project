  people go bankrupt all the time . 
  it 's better than usury . 
  so why apply usury for a country ? 
  maybe the best net result would be to forgive the debt . 
  or maybe greece should sell off part of its geography to settle the debt . 
  there needs to be a groundswell of protest from both fans and players . 
  it 's simple : ** do n't go , do n't watch , do n't play ** ** do n't go ** to qatar to watch the world cup . 
  ** do n't watch ** world cup matches on television . 
  ** do n't play ** in the world cup if you are a player . 
  remember people - this is the result of modern football . 
  corruption , lies , slavery . 
   * the reason those lands are empty ( and western sahara is n't , btw ) is that it is almost totally useless for farming . 
  apart from the potentially valuable mineral rights that would have to be given up for it , you 'd effectively be creating a giant refugee camp which would be more or less permanently dependent on foreign aid because they 'd not be able to get their economy started . 
  * yet another person who did n't read what i wrote . 
  honestly , if you want to reply and make constructive criticism , * make sure you read the freaking article first * . 
  it 's people like you who make the internet suck . 
  stop it . 
   * who would want to govern this mess that you propose ? 
  * typical . 
  you did n't even read what i wrote . 
  idiot . 
   * idealistic nonsense * far from it . 
  i 'm very happy to admit that the idea has problems . 
  i 'm hardly proposing a utopia . 
  and it is entirely doable . 
  america was founded on immigrants and refugees and they built some pretty impressive cities . 
  why are n't the precedents of history being considered in your mind ? 
  or could it be that i am from a country that built itself out of nothing , knowing the possibilities of success , instead of from a country that is mired in violence and racism , and who sent its best to countries like mine to live ? 
  i do n't think you actually read what i wrote . 
  nor have you met any immigrants or refugees . 
  i worked with a refugee back in the late 1990s . 
  she was a young afghan woman . 
  she and her family escaped the soviet occupation . 
  she came to australia and worked hard . 
  she was a work colleague at a service station in sydney . 
  she chose not to wear her hijab , and at the beginning her skills were very poor . 
  but she worked hard at changing them , and she became one of the hardest workers there . 
  she was also studying to be primary school teacher at the time . 
  refugees come in all shapes and sizes , but one thing unites them - the desire for a better place to live . 
  they want nothing more than to live and work and have a peaceful life . 
  look at the people who built modern dubai . 
  not the rich investors - the poor sods who they pretty much turned into slaves . 
  they slaved day and night for a pittance of a wage and , in the end , built dozens of skyscrapers . 
  * these * are the sort of people refugees are - people looking for a better life . 
  at least in the idea i propose , they 're given rights and decent wages . 
  just remember - ** the people wishing to leave a deadbeat country are not the ones who are responsible for it , but the victims of those who are responsible for it - those who are staying behind **, 
   * what are you , theodor herzl ? 
  * a land only for one religion , displacing those who already live there without their consent ? 
  hardly . 
  no migrants ever assimilate . 
  americans who live in china speak english amongst themselves , they watch american football , cook american food and so on . 
  the history of migration confirms this . 
  in the 19th century americans were complaining about all these awful migrants from germany and ireland and other parts of europe who were coming along and destroying american culture then . 
  it 's the same everywhere . 
  assimilation will never ever happen at the speed to which anyone is satisfied . 
  so why are n't there people complaining today about the descendants of the irish and germans in america now ? 
  simple - they 're no different to anyone else now . 
  and this is because * assimilation occurs over generations * . 
  a new migrant will never fully assimilate into the culture they migrated into . 
  their children will then face the problem of having two nationalities , their parents ' and their birthplace . 
  greek migrants to australia worked very hard to keep their australian born children from marrying outside the greek culture . 
  and there were inter-generational fights . 
  but what of the grand-children of the original migrants ? 
  it is they who are fully assimilated . 
  it is they who are happy to intermarry with other ethnic groups and religions . 
  in australia we had huge fights and problems between irish catholics and english protestants in the early-mid 20th century . 
  the two ethnic groups hated each other , and politics ended up dividing them somewhat ( the irish catholics associated themselves with the australian labor party ) . 
  but 100 years later and there 's no problems at all between the descendants of these groups . 
  100 years from now , all the hoo-haa of middle-eastern migrants integrating in europe will be forgotten , while the great-grandkids , born from both sides of this current debate , will be screaming against migrants coming from another part of the world . 
  full on craic mate . 
  i mean there are small democratic nations and there a large democratic ones . 
  and while many nations are different , the most obvious similarity is that within the governmental structure there is an election for representatives who make up a legislative body , and there are various ways in which a country 's executive is determined , and there is also a way in which the judicial branch is determined . 
  afaik every single democratic country , big or small , monocultural or multicultural , has these institutions . 
  so how would annual referendums be somehow better for switzerland in the small scale and not not good for the eu in the large scale ? 
  as far as i can see , if you can scale basic representative democracies to big and small countries ( as we experience now ) why not scale another democratic institution ? 
   * nationalism was also instituted over dead bodies * the opposite is true . 
  internationalism and supranationalism was instituted during a lengthy time of peace . 
  why would a swiss-style direct democracy be unable to function in a eurozone of 500 million people ? 
  which league do they play in ? 
  neither is [ french guiana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_guiana ), 
   * downvotes prove that people have no idea about economics in this subreddit . 
  * i have a lot of knowledge about economics and i downvoted you . 
  i 'd be pretty happy if panama put in a request to join the eu and eurozone . 
  also in the news : no nation is perfect . 
  germany should buy greece from the greeks and turn them into german citizens ... with their consent of course . 
  urkel brands dikraine a ` mictatorship ', 
  what the us spends on r&d is what it does n't spend on universal health care . 
  the eu should 've added business laws and conditions to the [ community acquis ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/community_acquis ) to ensure that nations within the eu are not caught up in meaningless red tape . 
  greece should never have joined the eurozone without first having reformed business conditions . 
  america needs an enemy . 
  with communism gone they need something to rail against , so why not countries who have governments which provide good welfare systems for their citizens ? 
  some see europe being taken over by radical islam - seriously . 
  i 've been reading jm roberts * a history of europe * and it 's just amazing just how much europe 's history is tied in with its relationship to islam ( both positive and negative ) . 
  also : turkey should be in the eu . 
  for goodness sake , a european empire had its capital there . 
  i 'm finding it difficult to understand the logic you 're using here . 
  you 're saying that because inflation is n't predictable - but rather unpredictable - then it is good to reduce risk . 
  i agree with you here 100 % what i 'm finding difficult to understand is that you think that `` zeroflation '' is `` unpredictable '' . 
  in the end what i 'm talking about here is `` price stability '' . 
  the reason why i believe in `` zeroflation '' is because of the following .
