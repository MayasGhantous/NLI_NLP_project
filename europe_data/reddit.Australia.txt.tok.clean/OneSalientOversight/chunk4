  long term , europe has it made . 
  the us , by contrast , is in very bad shape . 
  everywhere i turn economists say that deflation hits the poor hardest because they receive the least income . 
  and now i see that inflation hits the poor hardest because the purchasing power of their income drops . 
  so let 's just assume that , maybe , the best outcome is price stability . 
  and that means the ecb is doing it right . 
  eurobashers really need to read this . 
  my understanding is that too much immigration leads to racism , and too little immigration is the result of racism . 
  i think a nation ( or a currency zone like the eu ) should aim to have * no more than 10 % of its population born overseas * . 
  immigrants are still let in , but at a slow rate . 
  at the same time nations like japan should be forced to increase their immigrant quota to the 10 % figure . 
  another metric would be to allow as many immigrants in to replace any net population reductions . 
  many rich european nations these days have populations that are beginning to shrink because of low birthrates . 
  if there are more people dying than are being born , then simply plug up the difference with immigrants . 
  corruption is not a given when it comes to government institutions . 
  some nations are better than others . 
  i agree . 
  what 's the point of having the euro if nations do n't have the chance to help each other out ? 
  in the longer term it is better for greece to remain part of the eurozone . 
  why not allow a master 's degree as a universal immigration ticket ? 
  of course they would have to be from a reputable university and in a reputable subject but you could imagine the advantages if such people were allowed to freely immigrate to any country that has this system . 
  here at reddit , people just assume nuclear is the way to go .

  i personally do not believe that religions necessarily have to lead to violence . 
  it 's a correlation/causation thing whereby certain religions can be `` hijacked '' by those in power to serve their own ends . 
  and yes i am a christian . 
  and no i also do n't believe that atheism necessarily leads to violence either . 
  it 's a kind of magic, 
  [ here ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ity_public/2-13052011-ap/en/2-13052011-ap-en.pdf ) is the official eurostat release . 
  i have noticed over the years that because of the difference in the way europe and the us report gdp , there is often an assumption that the us is doing very well while the eu is slow and sclerotic and blah blah blah . 
  this difference in reporting has to do with an emphasis on either quarterly or or annualised or annual gdp . 
  here is the explanation : quarterly : how much gdp has increased since the previous quarter . 
  annualised : the quarterly result multiplied by four . 
  annual : how much gdp has increased since the same quarter of the previous year . 
  so according to the official eurostat release , and if we use quarterly / annualised / annual : us : 0.4 % / 1.6 % / 2.3 % eu17 : 0.8 % / 3.2 % / 2.5 % germany : 1.5 % / 6.0 % / 4.8 % greece : 0.8 % / 3.2 % / -4.8 % in short , 2011 q1 was very good for europe . 
  even greece 's economy grew in q1 compared to the previous quarter . 
  if greece leaves the eurozone then the only plausible response to its debt crisis would be to default on its debt . 
  this debt is not just owed to international investors , but also to greek citizens in the form of savings and pension funds . 
  so if there was a break from the eurozone , a re-introduction of a devalued drachma and a general debt default , many greek citizens will see their savings and retirement funds wiped out . 
  to be honest , greece should never have been allowed to join the eurozone until its own debt levels were under control . 
  this same rule should 've applied to other eurozone nations as well prior to joining . 
  it appears as though [ acquis communautaire ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/community_acquis ) analysis was too lenient . 
  i believe that greece leaving the eurozone and subsequently defaulting on its debt will serve no one any good at all . 
  the eu , especially germany , will probably have to pay off some of greece 's debt in order to maintain the union . 
  keeping greece in the eurozone is a better outcome for both greece and the eurozone . 
  some days you ca n't get rid of europe . 
  sadly an april fools joke . 
  seriously , though , turkey should be fast-tracked into membership . 
  reasons : * secular since attaturk . 
  * member of the council of europe since 1949 . 
  * part of nato since 1952 * [ ankara agreement ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/ankara_agreement ) in 1963 between turkey and eec for accession . 
  * part of the european union customs union since 1995 . 
  of course turkey will have to change its laws and policies according to [ acquis ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/community_acquis ) , but this would only strengthen turkey 's long term viability and potential contribution to the eu . 
  it would also allow the eu to have a border with the middle east ( syria , iraq , iran ) as well as a border with central asia ( georgia , armenia , azerbaijan ) . 
  this would increase trade opportunities with these areas and improve european-islamic relations , not to mention improving living standards in this part of the world and possibly even exporting turkish secularism to overly islamic nations .

  one world government and currency ftw !, 
  there seems to be a lot of people out there who do n't like robert mundell 's decades-old theory of [ optimum currency areas ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/optimum_currency_area ) . 
  co-ordinated anarchism - a dangerous irony . 
  that is wonderful : that is wonderful - a great day for estonia . 
  a lot of eurosceptic commentators - especially those who criticise the eurozone - forget that the eurozone was pushed into existence partly because of the events of [ black wednesday ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_wednesday ) in 1992 . 
  the economic damage which occurred because of rapid exchange rate fluctuations convinced many economists that a single currency would help prevent future issues between european nations . 
  decline is long , slow and inevitable . 
  relevant : [ optimum currency area ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/optimum_currency_area ), 
  turkey has been part of modern european history for the past couple of centuries . 
  they have been a member of nato from the very start and they have sovereign territory west of the bosphorus in `` europe '' . 
  they are part of the [ eu customs union ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/european_union_customs_union ) and the [ council of europe ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/council_of_europe ) . 
  since wwii ended turkey has been there as a recognised part of europe , participating in these various european organisations . 
  while turkey would certainly gain a lot of political clout in the [ european parliament ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/european_parliament ) they would not have majority and nor would they have more than germany ( at least until population changes over time - but turkey 's birth rate is nearly below replacement level ) . 
  [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union ) is interesting . 
  i happen to think that this is good news . 
  americans especially like to criticise europe and the single currency zone without realising just how innovative and powerful a single currency can be when nations agree to belong to it . 
  for starters it would ensure turkey remains secular . 
  religious freedom is enshrined in the eu constitution , as is the importance of the church/state divide . 
  turks are happy being turks and membership of the eu wo n't lead to wholesale immigration . 
  in order for turkey to become a member of the eu , their economy and society must have laws common with other eu states . 
  turkey 's membership of the eu would ensure that their laws protect minorities , look after the environment better and allow room for market forces to help turkish businesses . 
  the eu also gives structural funds to poorer members . 
  turkey would gain modern road and rail infrastructure , an increase in public education funds and better hospitals and doctors . 
  in short , turkey stands to gain more from membership of the eu than the eu gains by letting turkey join . 
  membership would also spur the middle east into modernity too ; turkey is already a better model of government and society and economy than any other middle eastern country and already stands as an example to follow . 
  moreover , countries like syria , armenia , iraq , georgia , azerbaijan and iran would end up bordering with the european union , thus promoting trade and progressive policies in those countries . 
  i personally see the accession of turkey to the eu as the beginning of a modern , liberal middle east , rather than as a threat to civil society . 
  americans so want the european union to split because it offers a genuine alternative influential political force in world politics . 
  if the greece situation gets worse the result inevitably will be an emergency meeting of eu members who will then approve a change in laws to allow the rest of the eu to bail greece out . 
  of course that will add to the eu 's overall problems , but government deficits and levels of debt in the eu ( and especially the eurozone ) are better than the us .

  there 's all sorts of benefits with uniform laws , uniform interest rates , uniform tax rates to go along with universal international health care , universal international public schools and an international welfare state . 
  it 's just one big [ autarky ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/autarky ) , and there wo n't be any `` international trade '' or exchange rates .
