i have read the recently leaked comments by the mods ( [ here ] ( https://imgur.com/a/vxiar ) ) and i ca n't see where the mods banned someone who did n't break one the subreddit 's rules ( [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) ) . 
  is the literacy rate really that low ? 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_literacy_rate ) bosnia 's literacy rate is higher than countries like france , canada , denmark , germany , the netherlands , and sweden . 
  the policy of sitting back and letting us decide what is ok to post here ? 
  i see posts like this on the front page daily , some with little upvotes and some with many . 
  from what i 've seen the mods are becoming much more relaxed and simply letting us write whatever . 
  i 've seen things written here that break the [ community rules ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) but most of it ends up not being deleted . 
  well in oslo i think it was something like 8 immigrants who committed rape in oslo in one year but that was just for rape where the victim was not known to the rapist prior . 
  it was also the only rape category that immigrants made a majority in . 
  my example was extreme but i was only trying to make it simple to understand . 
  and i do n't think there are many people who would call deporting norwegian immigrants who were n't citizens as racist . 
  maybe in sweden but in australia it would be seen as pretty reasonable and from speaking with other europeans they 'd think so as well . 
  no one was actually offended . 
  the hospital mistakenly thought someone would be offended . 
  [ do n't you use both ? ], 
  ( http://www.eurfedling.org/maps/alphabets_europe.jpg ), 
  what is absurd about ` intersex ' ? 
  intersex is a biological reality . 
  some people ca n't be classified as simply ` male ' or ` female ' . 
  pretty sure these would fall under lgbtqi * . 
  i do n't see how that 's possible . 
  how many sexual minorities are n't represented with lgbtqi . 
  i guess if they ever add too many letters people will probably just start saying ` sexual minorities ' . 
  intersex . 
  i thought novak was used by pagans who converted to christianity to mean something like ' a new man ' maybe referring to a ` rebirth ' of a person when entering christianity . 
  from what i 've been told the turkish \u0131 is like the swedish y. 
  also they would n't be speaking any dialect from syria . 
  most likely religious muslims who learn arabic learn msa . 
  i do n't know if saddam was an atheist or not but the phrase ` allahu akbar ' can be said by anyone . 
  it can mean different things depending on the context . 
  it would be like saying i ca n't be atheist while using the phrase ` thank god ' . 
  yes , i know . 
  a prime example is the article greenecat posted . 
  what can get more clicks than an article ` exposing ' a famous picture that influenced a war in europe ? 
  the article he linked claiming to expose a hoax turned out to be a lie fyi . 
  except most of these people were n't immigrants so his point still stands . 
  and ? 
  what 's the ratio of terrorists to immigrants in france ? 
  this logic is useless . 
  it 's like saying if hitler was never born we would n't have the holocaust . 
  i do n't live in france so i do n't know exactly how some muslims became radicalised over there but immigration does n't cause terrorism . 
  their immigrant parents/grandparents were n't terrorists so why were those that were born and raised in western europe so radical ? 
  so where is safe for homosexuals in ukraine ? 
  i was n't aware of homophobia being stronger in the west part of ukraine . 
  yes i know that . 
  what role does that play in immigration ? 
  some of those attacks you listed were personal and not against a state . 
  these people were born and raised in those countries . 
  their immigrant descendants did not commit terrorist acts yet it 's the immigrants who are causing all the terror ? 
  if it 's the big bad immigrants who are committing terrorist attacks then why were almost all your examples of people born and raised in europe ? 
  they 're not subjects of a crown . 
  citizens of france and denmark do n't need to show ` loyalty ' to a country . 
  it 's absurd and backwards . 
  these people are n't immigrants , they 're the descendants of immigrants . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saint-quentin-fallavier_attack this guy was born in france but his ancestry is from north africa . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zvornik_police_station_shooting this guy was born in bosnia . 
  he 's a native . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_copenhagen_shootings this guy was born in denmark . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charlie_hebdo_shooting both were born in france and were french citizens . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_dijon_attack born in france and mentally ill .  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_museum_of_belgium_shooting interestingly enough this guy was born in france . 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toulouse_and_montauban_shootings born in france . 
  the only two that were born outside of western europe were these : 1 . http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/04/22/01016-20150422artfig00155-aurelie-chatelain-32-ans-victime-du-terrorisme.php 2 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_stockholm_bombings, 
  well there was that stormfront thread a while ago about spreading the ` pro-white message ' on places like / r/europe . 
  [ ` swarming on reddit ' ] ( https://www.stormfront.org/forum/t1018437/ ) also an article written by the daily stormer in may 2015 about ` promoting the pro-white message ' on reddit and listing / r/europe as one of the places ` fertile for recruitment ' . 
  [ ` reddit is fertile ground for recruitment ' ] ( http://www.dailystormer.com/reddit-is-fertile-ground-for-recruitment/ ), 
  i remember one told by slavoj zizek . 
  how does a montenegrin masturbate ? 
  he digs a hole in the ground , puts his penis in it and waits for an earthquake . 
  interestingly i remember reading an old bosnian text that used ` vojna ' in the context of war . 
  i think it was from 14th or 15th century . 
  well , what i mean is what 's the general view of it in czech media ? 
  in australian media we have a positive attitude to it but some media outlets give a disproportionate amount of attention to supposed ` dole bludgers ' for constantly being on welfare and refusing to work . 
  these people are a very small minority but get a lot of attention . 
  i must have mixed it up with another country . 
  how are the topics of racism and state welfare handled in the media ? 
  maybe in sweden the mainstream media has a left-leaning bias but i 'd imagine in the czech republic that the mainstream media would probably lean more towards the right . 
  sorry if this is a stupid question but how is it at 75 % if half the votes were positive ? 
  should n't it be 50 % ? 
  atm it 's 85 % ( 60 points , 86 votes ) btw . 
  so if i draw a picture of the prophet muhammad and get stabbed for it is it my fault because of cause ( drawing muhammad ) and effect ( getting stabbed ) ? 
  regardless if it 's expected it 's still wrong . 
  well in english we have ` gas the kikes . 
  race war now ' , which is pretty colloquial . 
  and most swedes speak english quite well so i do n't think it 'll be anything new . 
  they did . 
  they closed it to 32,000 ft i think . 
  i do n't know if you 're serious but saudi arabia is n't head of the un human rights council . 
   i 'm not optimistic to be able to cope with 7 cases and heavy noun inflection . 
  then try bulgarian . 
  vast majority of refugees did not have weapons . 
  they were flown into the countries that they were granted asylum . 
  they did n't walk or drive to sweden , norway , denmark , or germany . 
   brought them to sweden back in the 1990s . 
  yugoslav wars ended in 2001 . 
   it 's funny that the grenades in sweden are also of yugoslav origin . 
  ** it seems the bosnian and other yugoslav refugees brought them to sweden back in the 1990s . 
  ** who was bringing them to sweden in the 1990s ? 
  you 're changing what he wrote . 
  but that 's not what anarchisto said , which was who i was responding to . 
  are you telling me that yugoslavian refugees walked all the way to sweden carrying grenades with them ?
