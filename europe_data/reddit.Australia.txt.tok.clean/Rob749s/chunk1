i took a guess . 
  i knew it was one of them . 
  after the kievan rus , they got screwed by the golden horde , along with russia and belarus . 
  emerged to become part of the polish lithuanian commonwealth . 
  the black sea regions were overrun by turkic peoples of various factions until russia annexed the region under peter the great ( ? ) . 
  some history involving cossacks and ruthenians trying to distinguish themselves from russia . 
  physically , it 's a beautiful country . 
  an esl can pull it off , even if they 're fluent , so long as they do it with accent . 
  the ox may beat me, 
  whoa , whoa , whoa . 
  you mean in greek , those `` p `` s * are n't * silent ? 
  thanks guys . 
  well they 're both pretty much extensions on the jewish religion . 
  they 're very similar really . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elections_in_malta https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliament_of_malta https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/politics_of_malta, 
  true , true ... 
  which is bad , because now it is even easier for him to escape responsibility . 
  if he had to actually cast a parliamentary vote , he might have to think twice . 
  because ideally they are separate things ... 
  * golden * revolution . 
  you 'd need tens of millions for it to be successful in russia . 
  even then i doubt it would be enough . 
   what problem are you talking about here ? 
  libya , syria , iraq , afghanistan , etc. 
  you know , those apparently horrible places people are fleeing from . 
  instead of them coming to the west , we could take the west to them . 
   i really do n't see how we could solve them without stopping colonization first . 
  are there any colonies in the aforementioned countries ? 
   i do n't think it can outweigh the political destabilization caused by protectorates . 
  assuming it 's stable to begin with . 
  which it clearly is n't . 
  the idea is to bring more stability . 
  we may or may not know better , but they clearly want what we have ( or do n't have ) . 
  it may have been the wrong course in hindsight , but quitting it does n't seem to have fixed the problem either . 
  maybe pulling back made it worse ? 
  you know what , i 'm not even sure myself ... 
   germany needs more cheap workers they could have used bulgarians for that ... 
  perhaps we could `` assist '' the developing world by making them `` protectorates '' . 
  thanks , 
  yet another reason france is better , 
  was northern ireland considered a separate country in 1918 ? 
  is that a cultural thing though ? 
  i mean , the british public did n't * choose * that . 
  patagonia was very close to being british from what i understand . 
  britain basically owned argentina 's bank system , built their infrastructure , and sent plenty of colonists . 
  argentina itself was almost british . 
  china has always been extremely populous . 
  i would doubt that any empire that did n't include china would count for more than half the population of the world . 
  i never realised that was that proverb meant . 
  i always thought it meant * every day is our heyday . 
  funny , my assumption was that using a church for anything other than prayer was tantamount to desecration . 
  i thought that there was a sort of secular practicality to commandeering a place of worship for the extremely non-spiritual act of voting . 
  how so ? 
  i thought france was just as non-religious as the uk . 
  there is no difference . 
  that is the irony . 
  a foreigner calls himself an expat . 
  i 'm fine with pineapple , but corn ? 
  wtf ? 
  or turkey will be persia/iran 2.0, 
  a large * minority * voted against him . 
  so to it still does need to be acknowledged that turks as a whole are in agreement with his ideals / goals, 
   germans , they elect the `` leader '' of the eu howso ? 
  why the hate for the ethnically british ? 
  imagine if i said `` i ca n't wait until nigerians are a minority in their own country '' . 
  why is it insane ? 
  the state usually pays for the infrastructure in the first place , it should make sense that it owns it . 
  suspiciously so . 
  it 's almost `` fishy '' . 
  consensus means every individual has a veto . 
  i do n't think that 's what any form of functional society is based on . 
  actually it was the celtic british ( welsh + cornish ) who colonised armorica . 
   they can also blockade their maritime waters around gibraltar . 
  that would certainly choke out the place . 
  no way would they retaliate , right ? 
  i mean , it 's not like madrid is within bombing distance of a dozen uk air force bases or anything ... 
  this is why bicameralism exists . 
  one house to represent the people , the other to represent the states . 
  federal law can also be limited in jurisdiction . 
  but assuming the `` degressive proportionality '' clause of the current treaties , i think it would be one of the fairest federal structures in existence , in regards to small states . 
  it 's because they know brits would n't be interesting in rafting . 
  it 's too much like sport . 
  i see no problem with this . 
  why would anyone dislike romanians ? 
  i feel the same way . 
  around these parts , they are trying to modernise aboriginal languages . 
  the reverse translation for `` computer '' is `` thunder brain '' . 
  sometimes we just borrow whole sentences `` c'est la vie '' etc. 
  here in the english speaking world , we did the same thing with french , latin , spanish , danish , hindi , arabic etc. . . 
  british , irish and german . 
  i did an ancestry dna thing , and i 'm 96 % british , 2 % scandinavian and 2 % iberian . 
  i 'm pretty damn british , at least genetically . 
  nationality-wise i 'm australian . 
  because i choose to be , it 's my identity . 
  i do n't think i 'd have a hard time `` becoming '' british or irish or even french or german if i wanted to . 
  yup, 
  the entire family was german was my point . 
  i can get behind this . 
  is `` the local '' any good ? 
  in this day and age , pedantry is good .
