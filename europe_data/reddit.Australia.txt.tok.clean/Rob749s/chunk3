  i can do an american accent but my face hurts after about 5 minutes . 
  the anglo-terran confederacy, 
  i see no problem here . 
  playing in water is much more liberating and fun than being encumbered by layers of clothing or breathing burnt wood . 
   europe actually getting off its fat doughnut-eating rear-end and putting order in the conflict-zones where these refugees are coming from ? 
  is n't that just imperialism though ? 
  would n't that be imposing our values and impeding their right to self-determination ? 
   i do n't get why some people want the problems to develop before starting to address them . 
  is n't that the way many people see this mass immigration though ? 
  that something should be done before it becomes a problem ? 
  i ca n't do that one :(, 
  me too . 
  but i would like transatlantic to be a bigger part of that diversity . 
  which one ? 
  i am a fan of transatlantic english . 
  then so be it . 
  but i 'd imagine there 'd simply be more types of english . 
  i do n't know why . 
  they seem to be ok with india doing it ... 
  what is the motive of that propoganda ? 
  i do n't know why they would . 
  they seem to get along with aus pretty well . 
  it 's where all our businesses go for tax breaks . 
  please do . 
  i 'd prefer if the eu just used it 's own version of english . 
  pronounce and spell things however you want , let popularity sort out the details . 
  i may be unique in this , but i 'd love for there to be a transcontinental english accent . 
  i 'd even pronounce my `` r `` s if americans pronounced `` o `` s better . 
  let 's not forget that northern england was still politically relevant at this point in time too , so it would n't be as `` stigmatised '' as it is now . 
  scotland was also vastly more relevant . 
  considering rp was `` invented '' less than a hundred years ago , and based on upper class accents , it 's very unlikely that was ever the most common ( frequently occurring , not class ) form of english . 
  my hypothesis would be that the us veered away from the aristocratic accent because they were n't frequently exposed to it , and adopting it would have no social advantage . 
  as opposed to london where people thought you were `` better '' if you spoke `` better '' . 
  i am god , and i am fucking awesome . 
  love me , and only me . 
  not even pictures of me . 
  you know what ? 
  do n't even say my name unless you are praising me . 
  then take a whole day off every week to bask in my awesomeness . 
  every week . 
  forever . 
  be nice to your parents . 
  do n't kill . 
  do n't have sex with anyone who is n't your wife . 
  do n't steal . 
  do n't lie . 
  do n't be envious of other people 's stuff . 
  4 of those are solid foundations . 
  adultery and envy are open to debate . 
  and the first 4 are just showing what a narcissistic wanker god is . 
  there are dozens of american accents , just as there are dozens of british ones . 
  people still speak cockney despite being surrounded by other london accents all day . 
  scottish is still distinct , as is scouse and irish . 
  a kentucky accent is distinct from minnesota , and new york , and la. 
  there is no reason they ca n't coexist . 
  with rides like [ this ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?rlz=1c1azaa_enau747au747&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=925&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=the+viking+boat+seaworld&amp;oq=the+viking+boat+seaworld&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...4069.5956.0.6019.9.9.0.0.0.0.171.974.0j6.6.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..3.1.158...0i30k1j0i24k1.o2u0yp8y27o#imgrc=pqnhiv4gyvnidm: ), 
  counter-point : the american media is currently bursting at the seems with british ( and commonwealth ) entertainers . 
  i do n't see it so much as a takeover as a melding . 
  all we 're seeing is english speaking countries trying out each others ' words . 
  the general rule is context . 
  the duck of willing tongue . 
  why was n't it part of the official orthography then ? 
  do n't worry , \u1e9ee happy . 
  since we 're resurrecting letters . 
  can we start using \u00fe ( thorn ) or \u03b8 ( theta ) ? 
  digraphs annoy me for some reason . 
  [ big enough , really ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x6pkeugcv-s/tzokga1hvwi/aaaaaaaaagc/hvghn2j8yre/s640/mapfrappe+google+maps+mashup+-+indonesia+vs+united+states.png ) . 
  borneo and papua is still fairly untapped , too . 
  nah , they 'll just emigrate . 
  it 's not a child , it 's an animal that will grow up and devour your own children . 
  it 's not a mother , it 's a succubus , an enslaver , a murderer . 
  the animal must be killed for the greater good . 
  and the mother must be punished for her wickedness . 
  that 's what it means to dehumanise . 
  you intentionally strip away their identity , so that you feel no empathy , no sympathy , and no remorse . 
  only burning hatred and resolve to see the world rid of their kind . 
  i agree with this . 
  and the pope should sit in jerusalem . 
  thanks for being patient with me !, 
  with the dictatorship i guess i was more referring to elections . 
  it seems daily life is actually fairly normal for most people in belarus ? 
  so it 's `` just '' a statist dictatorship ? 
  i do n't mean that as a pejorative either , just a way to describe it . 
  i did n't know belarus even existed until i left school . 
  it 's a mystery to me , but i am trying to learn at least a little about it . 
  i seem to have jumped to some conclusions which were totally inaccurate , so it 's great some people are setting me straight . 
  wow , i was totally wrong . 
  thanks . 
  i get the feeling i 've offended you . 
  sorry , that was n't my intention . 
  belarus is de jure a communist state still , yes ? 
  i 'm just curious about the future outlook from an economic and cultural perspective since , rather obviously although not uniquely , i do n't know much about it . 
  in answer to your questions - yes - we 're already america 's backyard . 
  although more like the sandpit in the corner of the backyard . 
  - we grow our own weed and meth but we have had problems with colombian cocaine dealers . 
  - do n't see a lot of mexicans , mostly chileans . 
  - the coal power stations are very old , and there is no plan to replace them . 
  with anything . 
  we 're quite fucked at this point . 
  - the barrier reef will survive but it will never be the same again .
