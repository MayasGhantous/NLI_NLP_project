  would it be fair to say that belarus is in a somewhat similar position to where china was 10 years ago ? 
  should we expect a transition to a similar system of `` state capitalism '' ? 
  the poultritariat advance !, 
  thanks for giving our lads somewhere to practice pouring beer . 
  can i buy a house in bulgaria ? 
  i do n't speak french but i know who laetitia casta is . 
  enjoy an upvote for reminding me of my teenage years . 
  i 'm fairly sure that 's what will happen, 
  i get that . 
  not that long ago , irish nationalism was heavily catholic and right wing . 
  you 're right though they are obviously different . 
  that was my point too . 
  23 chromosomes worth . 
  i 'm half joking . 
  the idea was they use their own sperm with someone else 's ovum in someone else 's womb inside their own body . 
  it 's a solution to them having their own genetic child . 
  like i said , my stance is that i 'm not entirely fussed , but i get that people would n't want to pay for it . 
  not sure i would either . 
  what if they used their own frozen sperm ? 
  to inseminate themself ? 
  i think i see what you 're saying . 
  `` why not just adopt or use a surrogate ? '', 
  i guess adoption has it 's own problems , once the child finds out they 're adopted . 
  and surrogacy sort of adds a `` third wheel '' to the mix which could be awkward in the same vein as adoption . 
  totally understand you not wanting to pay for it though . 
  i would n't think that having your genitals mutilated and your entire body re-sculpted to appear the opposite sex , over the course of years , is a decision made lightly . 
  to my knowledge there is quite a bit of counselling involved beforehand to ensure it 's not taken lightly . 
  it 's not like getting a tattoo . 
  if by `` whim '' you mean `` choice '' , sure . 
  if you mean `` flight of fancy '' , then i disagree . 
  me too . 
  but i 'd rather keep my dick . 
  and you do n't really get a half million bucks , you get a half million bucks * worth of dick slicing , remodelling , breast implants , hormones , face surgery etc. 
  you do n't actually see a single dime . 
  no one would go through that unless they wanted to . 
  it 's pretty safe from abuse . 
  * or whatever the figure is, 
  lol what ? 
  that 's not how contract conditions work . 
  the only argument they can make is `` we 're bigger and stronger and do n't want to so fuck you '' . 
  that 's it . 
  that seems to be their position on the south china sea too , so it 's at least consistent . 
  well for example , would this person suffer from a mental health perspective were this unattainable ? 
  will they be a better functioning member of society if it is ? 
  i have no idea . 
  i 'd hope the person who `` greenlit '' this has some way of justifying it . 
   publicly-funded whims are a no-go that 's not a principle of mine . 
  depends on cost-benefit . 
  i do n't disagree with any of what you 've said . 
  i just do n't care that this surgery exists . 
  and i do have some reservations about the state paying for it , but i suppose a business case could be made about how much this person could cost the state through welfare were this denied . 
  this surgery is essentially buying a pot . 
  it will be interesting to see how many of these surgeries they actually do , in regards to the cost . 
  well . 
  yes and no . 
  it 's like a pot-plant . 
  you need a fertilised seed from elsewhere , but once it 's in the pot and you give it enough water and nutrient rich soil , it can grow . 
  so you could pay a stranger to `` carry '' a baby for you , and end up with a weird relationship afterwards , or you could do it yourself . 
  why do n't we [ meet halfway ? 
  ] ( http://www.chetzar.com/images/film/schism3.jpg ), 
  oohh , i get it . 
  wow . 
  why would a private company do anything they did n't want to * unless * the courts are involved ? 
  french or german ? 
  although it does rely on either of them agreeing . 
  in terms of who currently speaks it , sure it would take time , but if it 's deemed important enough ( which it could well be ) , the resources will be put towards changing that situation . 
  so , how is this actually enforced ? 
  through the police as for any other hate speech reported ? 
  i think the bundestag has greatly underestimated the size of this task . 
  sounds a bit like apostasy punishment , does n't it ? 
  the way i see it , ireland is weary of nationalism and so embraces globalism . 
  britain is weary of globalism and is embracing nationalism . 
  as an non-euro anglophone , the only real thing i personally have at stake is the prestige of the english language . 
  english had slowly become the `` working language '' of the eu , but now it is highly likely to be replaced , at the very least for political reasons . 
  there is a theory that this occurred because italic and celtic were [ very similar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italo-celtic ), 
  i agree with your point but that 's a terrible image of chris , it 's been photoshopped terribly . 
  no one 's biceps look like that . 
  wow , it does . 
  a touch arabic , too . 
  i like to think of what serbian sounded before slavic influence . 
  ( i do n't actually , but this is analogous to your postulation ), 
  potato and banana latka !, 
   basic income has to take wealth and income through work and things like stocks into consideration . 
  i 'm sure it does , at tax time . 
  holy smokes , those towns are awesome, 
  almost , 
  what about [ the bus that could n't slow down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dirivkkt_nk ) ? 
  funny name for a movie about maintaining a ** minimum velocity ** . 
  that sub makes me weep for humanity . 
  europetowns ** were ** the international cities . 
  they 're a different beast now though . 
  and i think there could be room for something like that , particularly in south east asia . 
  not in the same way . 
  most of it is this monolithic modern culture , that definitely has european roots but is n't really european . 
  chinatown is sort of a cliche of chinese culture , there is n't really a european equivalent . 
  maybe because it 's difficult to settle on what a cliche of europe would look like . 
  maybe `` europetown '' will be the next big thing in international cities . 
  well ok then , 
  was n't there talk of him being impeached though ? 
  as far as i know , the eu is the ** only ** international organisation with a permanent , directly elected body of representatives that form an integral part of the decision making .
