  no trade deal in the world will give you that , no customs union , no military alliance . 
  it is by far the ** most democratic ** international organisation ever . 
  in the case of the the uk and france it 's more democratic than at the national level , since proportional representation allows a greater selection of parties to choose from . 
  jeez , it 's been ( and will continue to be ) a bumpy ride . 
  sucks for you guys :(, 
  not really , fascism in the loosest sense * can * simply mean authoritarian . 
  if there are no borders , there is no state . 
  if there is no state , there can be no law . 
  if there is no law there is only one law , the [ law of the jungle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_the_jungle ) . 
  ok , so assuming iohannis will not appoint whoever dragnea wants , and assuming the parliament will not approve whoever he appoints - does this mean elections ? 
  because treaties and paper are a poor shield against bullets and bombs . 
  ask poland . 
  hang on , are these croatian communists declaring they want to give half of their country to a `` capitalist '' nation ? 
  a good read , but it seems to gloss over the obvious link ; ** language ** . 
  i 'm not sure of vucetic 's ethnicity , but i 'm guessing southern slavic , so it should be fairly easy for him to understand a parallel between `` pan-anglism '' and the many pan-slavic movements . 
   undemocratic do you get a referendum on every trade deal ? 
  or even every treaty ? 
  you 're right it can be undemocratic , but undemocratic is the norm in international relations . 
  why set the bar higher for the eu ? 
  it is already a better system than any set of treaties ever , because you actually do have democratic representation at multiple levels of the co-ordinating institutions . 
  would you make these same claims against the wto ? 
  against nato ? 
  against the un ? 
   certain countries are failing to meet the economic goals i live in a federal nation and this happens all the time . 
   and this recent refusal to accept immigrants by some members . 
  are n't they using some `` emergency '' clause to get around it ? 
  which is technically legal despite any moral reservations one may hold . 
  the fact that it gives governments * plausible deniability * is bad enough , but basically you 're arguing for vigilantism on a warlike scale . 
  i do n't think so . 
  if the empire ever stopped warring , soldiers would be sent home . 
  colonial reporting in . 
  i joined r/ireland to get a feel for the culture and politics of the place . 
  i 'm not even half irish but my greater grandparents were from cork and limmerick stock . 
  although i 've read griffins were descended from welsh so who knows . 
  anyway , i just wanted to learn more , and the lack of language barrier makes it very accessible . 
   the eu has multiple issues . 
  yep  no matter what you think of brexit let 's not pretend that the eu does n't have problems . 
  i do n't think anyone does . 
  in fact if it was perfect , it would be redundant . 
   there are multiple countries that have large segments of the population that want to leave . 
  true . 
   many members are not abiding by parts of the agreement . 
  like what ? 
   now the issue with refugees and possible sanctions . 
  yep  the uk leaving the eu does n't make the eu stronger . 
  i disagree . 
  the uk has been the voice of dissent and antagonism to the entire project for the past 10 years at least . 
  it has been all too keen to throw the baby out with the bathwater . 
  it was literally holding the union back . 
  if the uk disagrees on the direction of the union , perhaps getting out is for the best , for everyone . 
  hahaha . 
  that 's awesome . 
  because we want to know what 's going on but do n't speak romanian . 
  you guys do n't get a lot of attention in our press , but this is serious shit that people should know about . 
  her death will be bittersweet . 
  because it would be fucking amazing to read her memoirs . 
  what ? 
  what is the threat to `` the '' english language ? 
  is the us government afraid people will forget that they are american ? 
  is that what american passports * actually * look like ? 
  try google, 
  ah ok . from what i understand it was germanised by the teutonic order and was a german population until 1945 . 
  i guess i was talking political control . 
  as the [ duchy of prussia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duchy_of_prussia ) , it was a fief to poland . 
  apparently it was also russian for 5 years during the 7 years war . 
  was n't it polish at some point too ? 
  what 's undemocratic about it ? 
  all good . 
  it happens to all of us . 
  how could it be anything * but * fun with john cleese ? 
  i made the original reference to racism , remember ? 
  i assumed greeks etc were `` white enough '' for ph et al. 
  i 'm anglo irish german and browner than most of my greek and italian friends , so i do n't really think of them as non white . 
  i kind of prefer to use `` european '' rather than skin colour for this reason . 
  apart from that i pretty much agree . 
  i would n't think they 'd have too big a problem if they 're white . 
  unless of course ph and co are n't racist , and simply protectionist . 
  and if that 's the case a lot of people owe them a big apology . 
  how long since you 've been home ? 
  the outrage brigade is strong . 
  obviously that 's the rational perspective . 
  which has no place in discussions like these . 
  believe me , people would be very , very upset . 
  ` murica !, 
  wait , what ? 
  personally , i 'd be all for it . 
  but i guess i 'm less optimistic about the influence of the far left in this country . 
  which is a bit of a contentious issue to a significant proportion of the population . 
  she seems nice enough , i guess . 
  who does n't though ? 
  i guessed that much , corey is not that infamous ... my point is that although i think the eu is great , and by far the majority of australians have european heritage ( not exclusively british ) , a move towards the source of our colonialism would be frowned upon by the wider australian public . 
  the argument could be made that such a move is dismissive towards non-european australians , or in favour of white ethnicities , and i have no doubt that it would be seen as such . 
  i do n't want to turn this into r/australia , but needless to say i think corey bernardi would be very much in favour of joining the eu . 
  i just said i 'm not sure i 'm comfortable with it because of the message that sends to both indigenous australians and other non-european australians . 
  but should n't the other party members force him to step down ? 
  i dont know ... france ? 
  how the fuck is he still the party leader then ? 
  because it would be seen as racist . 
  edit : i do n't mean this in an edgy alt right way . 
  a move towards colonial heritage would be frowned upon .
