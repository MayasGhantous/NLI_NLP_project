  four o one three five vs forty thousand , one hundred and thirty five, 
  the party whips in the uk are generally a lot stronger than those in the us , since pre-selection is generally internal to the party rather than a primary , and the party holds the keys to the campaign coffers . 
  well it kind of is . 
  you ca n't blame the system since it 's been the same since , i do n't know , forever ? 
  they should have voted more tactically . 
  british rain makes a moldy brain , 
  fyi `` liberal '' means `` economically conservative '' elsewhere in the world . 
  are they against free movement though ? 
  i thought they were against muslims . 
  so corbyn is basically a british varoufakis ? 
  this is one of those confusing english language inconsistencies . 
  a `` plurality '' or `` largest minority '' can be considered a `` simple majority '' . 
  above 50 % is known as a `` qualified '' or `` absolute majority '' . 
  any threshold higher than that is known as a `` supermajority '' . 
  a double majority means a majority ( of any kind ) across two separate criteria . 
  and then there other factors about to which group the term applies , those able to vote , or those who did vote . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/majority sometimes i think english is designed to obfuscate rather communicate information ... 
  keep calm and carry on , old chap . 
  because people work sundays too ? 
  maybe you and your friends could get some brown shirts and help * encourage * people to vote the right way . 
  183 years ?!!, 
  i ca n't believe that campaign worked ... 
  feels like scapegoating to me ... 
  almost like `` accidental gerrymandering '' . 
  thor and harley quinn ... whatever their real names are . 
  bonus oldies edition : hugh jackman and nicole kidman, 
  soon ... 
  you could have an instant runoff like us !, 
  but you voted against that ... 
  [ all i see is blonde , brunette , redhead . 
  ] ( https://drewreviewmovies.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/matrix1-idontseethecodeanymore.jpg?w=865&amp;h=375 ), 
  my god . 
  that 's horrible !, 
  it just looks like expensive favellas . 
   black number plates , how fucking cool is that we can get just about [ any colour we like ] ( http://www.plateshed.com/forum/uploads/monthly_04_2009/post-11098-1238733860.gif ) here , 
   the snp sole reason for existing is making scotland independent i do n't think that 's true . 
  so lichtenstein wants to be a canton ? 
  steampunk as fuck, 
  how would it be almost impossible ? 
  if the snp gets similar results , i 'd think a hung parliament could be quite likely . 
  takes time , my friend . 
  democracy is n't a latent part of the human psyche waiting to freed . 
  in most places it requires a change of culture . 
  you need to be patient and let those ideas take hold through cultural exchange . 
  i assumed `` base '' meant extensive operational capability . 
  thanks . 
  well , i 'm wrong then . 
  thanks . 
  are all those ... necessary ? 
  well the asian part * was n't * part of russia at the time . 
  what if it 's * old prussia * ? 
  the non-german kind . 
   poland predates germany by about 800 years . 
  pretty sure the japanese did it first , `` kamikaze '' . 
  only because everyone went on a long vacation and could n't get back to vote . 
  i do n't know why this is n't more common , it 's an obvious , effective solution to the problem . 
  so did the italians ( although fascist instead of nazi ) . 
  what if we call it `` garnished disc bread '' ? 
  so france is basically russia ? 
  better than that other flower-based product we got china addicted to in the late 19th century ... 
  mainly it 's disgusting ... 
  i 've always pronounced it moe-anna, 
  keep calm and do n't spill your beer . 
  not `` most people '' though . 
  surely ? 
  i think most people at least realise it is bc . 
  you 'd have to be a moron to think it was 500 years ago . 
  well op i was responding to was british , that 's why i was coming at it from that perspective . 
  if it was up to me , i 'd enforce the swiss system on my whole country ... 
  right , which convinced the british public . 
  so an even more extreme departue to the french system would be shot down twice as fast . 
  yes it would be an improvement , but you 'd never convince the british public . 
  considering the uk considered instant runoff voting too expensive , because counting takes an extra half a day , there 's no way they 'd go for paying for 2 elections . 
  not american . 
  but we do n't in australia and i 'm fairly sure they do n't there . 
  there are three different tiers of elections : local , state , and federal , and they all have independent election schedules . 
  in australia , federal elections are every 3 years , while my state and local elections are every 4 . 
  you have to run elections twice . 
  because france is the most reliably leftist country in europe . 
  so by french standards , he 's a neoliberal . 
  they sound expensive though . 
  i 'm a fan of the swiss/luxembourgish [ * panachage * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panachage ) system . 
  it 's essentially proportional representation by accident instead of design . 
  it allows votes for popular candidates votes to `` spill over '' to whoever the voter wants . 
  we use it in australia for our senate . 
  * another * display of backwardness . 
  ( yes i understand i 'm throwing stones from a glass house ) . 
   in school we 're tought that th is a special variation of z/s , is that the english `` th '' or the german ? 
  after looking up the pronunciation of `` thuringen '' , i 'm not sure i can tell the difference between a german `` th '' and `` t '' . 
  it 's hard to see a relationship to s/z , but there are [ people in english ca n't pronounce those ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisp ) , and it results in a th sound , so maybe they are related . 
  her chances will still be good . 
  the priorities of anglo media in order are : 1 ) make money 2 ) fuel outrage 3 ) sell fame . . . . 762 ) spread truth, 
  you 're only white because you live in the shade of hills and mountains . 
  two summers in australia and you 'll look like a spaniard . 
  the funny thing is how much closer he is to the american perspective than his predecessor . 
  but i think that just gives more hope that he can pragmatic . 
  mate , we 're already in . 
  they do . 
  and far more , because they need to protect themselves . 
  you do n't need to protect drones .
