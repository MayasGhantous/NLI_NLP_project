  i 'd hesitate to even call it democratic . 
  it 's the member-states that choose which projects they wish to pursue and apply for funding to the eu . 
  that 's a problem with how your government handles the issue , not the eu . 
  are you sure ? 
  article 14 of the marriage convention states  a contracting state may refuse to recognise the validity of a marriage where such recognition is manifestly incompatible with its public policy ( `` ordre public '' ) . 
  i imagine this was put in place to stop polygamy being recognized in some countries , but i do n't see why it could n't also be seen to apply to homosexual couples . 
  this would go against what i stated earlier with respect to the common market . 
  it seems much less clear-cut, 
  so do you think the eu does more good than bad for poland ? 
  ah , i 'm pretty central , do n't think i ever really head more than half an hour on foot from the centre so i do n't really see that . 
  but i saw a nigerian woman in camelot a few days ago who was having a conversation in polish . 
  [ he self-identifies as one , anyway ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1tgbyu/europe_spends_too_much_time_apologising_for_past/ce7rfj4 ), 
  i 've probably seen about 20-30 over the last 4 years , let alone that polish mp who 's from nigeria . 
  never any vietnamese , though . 
  well , that 's why i said harmonized to ` some degree ' , and not that gay marriage should be harmonized throughout the eu . 
  for example , what need would a country that does n't have gay marriage have for gay marriage discrimination laws ? 
  i agree it would be great if it could be done globally , but if the current system is insufficient within the eu ( i do n't know if it is or if it is n't , i 'm just speculating here ) , and it 's within the power of the eu to harmonize some laws relating to that , then i do n't see a problem . 
  and it does relate to the common market . 
  a gay couple should be able to get a posting in a country that does n't have gay marriage without worrying if the other spouse will be treated as a spouse . 
  no , it was a hypothetical . 
  but , assuming a common market is here to stay then there having separate such laws could constitute a violation of those eu principles . 
  if the rest of the world signed such a convention that you talk about then i 'd also be very happy with that ... but the eu exists as a body to promote european cooperation and harmonization of laws relating to the principles of the common market , and as such i do n't see why it could not have some degree of competence in this issue if such agreements as you mentioned are n't in place or are ineffective at promoting those in a practical sense within the purview of the treaties of the european union . 
  yeah , just like agoraphobe and arachnophobe . 
  i seem to bump into more nigerians than vietnamese whenever i 'm in poland . 
  or better yet , start your own platform and campaign for it . 
  unless you 're bat shit crazy , you should be able to get some level of support . 
  shut up , suffixphobe . 
  the swiss model would never be offered to the uk . 
  they only got that because the eu recognized it was terribly unfair to coerce them into joining by virtue of the fact that they 're surrounded . 
  do you mean the ` i 'm a new 18 year old at university and think i know everything about politics ' young people , or what ? 
  who tends to be the favourite amongst young people ? 
  it 's a good thing if those laws are harmonized to some degree . 
  going into the issue of gay marriage , what if a gay couple moves to a country that does n't recognize gay marriage and they face discrimination because of it ? 
  nonono , see , they 're going to remove countries from the eu , get rid of globalization , destroy the banks because theyre evil , and lower my taxes . 
  also , theyll ban immigration !, 
  socially left wing , economically right wing . 
  honestly , i would n't be surprised if flashback or somewhere stupider was brigading here either . 
  ah , you 're the person that keep creating new accounts and badgering at me because you 're too much of a coward to use your regular one . 
  no guys , it 's just a pro-europe circlejerk like we 've always been saying . 
  us poor eurosceptics always get downvoted by the facist europhiles that want the undemocratic eu to take over our countries !!, 
  also , ban immigration !, 
  oh christ , what a crock of shit . 
  you are such an intellectual cripple it 's beyond belief . 
  i said that if sweden did not get a good deal on the cap , they probably gave that up in exchange for something else . 
  you had some idealistic view where everything is always done perfectly , and so you disagreed . 
  i then said that if the swedish negotiating delegation to the eu did not get a good deal , then that 's their fault , they could always have refused to sign the new eu treaty . 
  they did n't do this , so either sweden was satisfied with the results , or had a ridiculously crappy negotiating delegations ... and were satisfied with the results since they signed it . 
  in your eyes , this is me being racist and discriminatory towards swedes , instead of an accurate and realistic portrayal of how international negotiations and relations work . 
  you are a joke . 
  they 're only mild if you compare them to the likes of the edl , gd or some ` eastern ' nationalist xenophobes . 
  there 've been purges in sd of those that openly express racist/fascist sentiments , but a polished turd remains a turd . 
  i studied in sweden for two years . 
  the vast overwhelming majority of them despise sd , even my friends from skane ( the traditional bastion of sd ) . 
  it 's just that many of the xenophobic / ` racist nuts from sweden are on / r/europe . 
  it 's unfortunate , there used to be quite a few reasonable swedes but they 've been driven out . 
  aggressively and contemptuously ? 
  he said a party that maybe many here do n't know about , i stated their political leaning and agreed that it matched up with his based on past interactions . 
  second , there was no ` dismissing ' of his opinions , and i 'd love it for you to point out where i did that . 
  thanks !, 
  so what is it that you find they do good exactly ? 
  most of what you 've written seems to be just that they 're normal people and that they 're not the prior established political class . 
  i do n't know it all , that 's why i asked you to explain it to me . 
  i even said they ** seem to be ** and said ** i do n't know much about them ** . 
  i wo n't disagree with you as i do n't know much about them , but that does n't mean i 'll necessarily agree with you either . 
  those guys seem to be political anarachists with no constructive solutions to me , but i 'll admit i do n't know much about them . 
  i do n't suppose you 'd educate me about them and why they would get your vote ? 
  it even literally says that on the wikipedia page . 
  not to mention this is what has been relayed to me by all my swedish friends and what i gathered from studying two years in sweden , let alone learning the language to a reasonable level . 
  do n't blame me because you assign moral connotations to those words . 
  high horse ? 
  that is the guys ( and the party 's ) position . 
  it 's not a moral judgement , it 's a statement of fact . 
  far right populist xenophobic party . 
  seems to be exactly your fit . 
  i have the same exact problem ( am currently living in poland ) . 
  alde is by far my first choice , and all the rest rank pretty equally last . 
  the greens , eurosceptics , nationalist independents and hard economic leftists just do not appeal to me at all . 
  i 'd consider the social democrats , but they 're filled with crypto-communists , whilst the greens would also be up there if it were n't for the fact that there are no green parties in poland , and the egp is infested with naive idealistic political-infant berlin-style greens . 
  he/she is from the uk . 
  [ beat you , no googling - 14812 ] ( http://url.geoguessr.com/5mtk ), 
  it 's one thing if you 're a penny stock , it 's another thing entirely if you 're a few euros/share . 
  yes , share price is important , but not in the context mentioned earlier ( as the best way to help the company ) . 
  it 's more complicated than that , we 've had to make deals with sovereign states like nauru to take them , or removing islands from the migration zone . 
  cmv is a terrible subreddit , where semantic arguments reign supreme and the actual point the op was trying to make is rarely challenged . 
  as i 've mentioned , i was talking about different cultures of looking at security ( german vs british ) , and i think that there is a massive difference in how the two societies view it , i was n't saying that ` because the stasi were bad , all surveillance is bad . 
  the germans had the records of the stasi being released in the 90s , the gestapo before that , and they are very conscious of how dangerous surveillance culture can be . 
  the british have n't been through that , and perhaps that 's why they 're less wary of it . 
  it 's not a matter of ` experiences with the stasi and the nazis mean the germans know better ' , it 's pointing out the different cultures . 
  on a personal level , i am concerned . 
  i 'm not saying this * is * happening but the way that many security apparati of the state operate these days is not transparent and at a questionable level of transparency . 
  combine that with recent spying on private citizens scandals , data sharing agreements in the hands of just the executive , lack of judicial oversight , recent scandals involving backdoors in computer software and there is a very worrying picture . 
  about two dozen british citizens have been stripped of their british citizenship this year with no judicial oversight or public scrutiny , based off the word of opaque security organisations and arbitrary decisions by the executive . 
  reportedly , these citizens went to syria to fight against assad and that 's why . 
  but how do we know that that was the case , how do we know these citizens intended to harm the uk , and how was this decision reached . 
  they 've basically been sentenced to permanent exile , and the public ca n't examine how . 
  given that , i think there 's serious reason for concern over how these kinds of systems operate , and the fact that british citizens are unconcerned is troubling . 
  new tools and powers should not be given to such organizations until there is a far greater level of transparency . 
  well then it 's a stupid argument , given that it has already been abused in the uk ( as per the earlier link ) and the rest of the world . 
  next he 'll be saying if you 've got nothing to hide you 've got nothing to fear, 
   this implies that part of the reason those germans do n't like cctv is because it 's a bit like something the stasi did .
