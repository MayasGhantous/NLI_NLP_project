  why does * every * article whenever greece and turkey have talks have to bring up that they have a troubled past as it 's central talking point ? 
  but beer can be made in so many other ways , whilst also preventing toxic substances from being put into the beer like those . 
  why would you still want it to be in place ? 
  if i recall correctly , it was introduced because the bakers were pissed off that brewers were using so much wheat and raising the price , and was adopted uniformly throughout germany as a precondition of unification to shut out competition outside bavaria . 
  why do you think the rules should stay in place for that reason ? 
  might i direct your attention to the wonderful sub called / r/badhistory , in that case ? 
  everyone knows the austrians are a sub-type of germans !, 
  just like the dutch and the flemish !, 
  that depends on how much you believe in the separation of powers . 
  if you 're a strict believer , the judiciary is n't meant to have de facto law-making powers , and given their wide purview in interpretation of the law it could be construed as them having some aspect of that power . 
  of course , in many countries the legislature and executive overlap as well , but as i said it depends on how strong a separation you want . 
  there are certainly advantages to both , so in sum my answer is a non-answer - i do n't know either law system intimately enough to state that one is clearly better than the other , though i do tend to favour common over civil due to my greater familiarity with it . 
  well then i will defer to your better judgement . 
   that politician is known to be of other than the prescribed opinion by the government so his life is n't worth anything . 
  funny , because he 's now under police protection at a safe location . 
  but you 're right , of course . 
  regardless , it 's been explained above that the police are looking at other charges , but they can only lay what they think they can immediately prove . 
  but of course , you and your bullshit rhetoric know better than the police that are under leftist control !, 
  fleet street is drunk on it 's own power . 
  they said it was possible they might change it to aggravated assault later on , that the charge is subejct to change as details emerge and that there is no known explicit threat . 
  as the investigation continues , and more details emerge , i 'm sure that will change . 
  but the police are professionals , they know what they 're doing and how best to conduct the investigation . 
  the crime can carry a maximum of [ 18 years or life in prison , and a minimum of one year ] ( https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/allm%c3%a4nfarlig_%c3%b6del%c3%a4ggelse ) , depending on the severity of the crime . 
  they 're not taking it lightly . 
  that 's because you prefer to live in an echo-chamber , than see any opinions you disagree with . 
  the guy made comments to the press following the hubbub that it was n't him that made the comments , but that someone had probably used his account , in which case i do n't think privacy would really stick . 
  libel would be a better fit it would seem , in which case it would have to go before that pre-case jury . 
  but then , i 'm not a lawyer , i just assume you did n't have access to that tidbit . 
  let alone with respect to internet freedoms !, 
  still , the swedes unfortunately use the civil law so i 'm not sure how much long term impact it would have . 
   most likely ( and again speculation ) the newspaper would have used its in-house lawyers so they would not have incurred fees for any advice . 
  also , a newspaper like expressen can afford to go to court and lose sometimes . 
  a couple of minutes [ 1 ] on google shows examples of expressen [ 2 ] fighting in the courts - and sometimes losing [ 3 ] . 
  perhaps you 're right . 
  i sometimes forget that espressen is a tabloid , and a particularly nasty one at that . 
  even in civil cases , i do n't think you 're correct . 
  sweden has a system whereby , in matters pertaining to freedom of the press , there is a pre-case jury where they determine if the issue is outside the scope of that freedom . 
  for it to go to court , two third have to side against the newspapers . 
  i 'm quite certain the case would fall under this , and i ' , skeptical that a claim to the contrary ( that it 's outside the scope of freedom of the press ) could successfully be made . 
   newspapers are notorious for prioritising sales over the law . 
  look at the uk newspapers . 
  i do n't think it 's fair to generalize anglophone newspaper culture to the rest of the world . 
  yes , newspapers are a business and their purpose is to make a profit , but lawyers are notoriously expensive , let alone what the outcome what the case would bring . 
  regardless , it 's idle speculation by us and i guess we 'll see what will happen in the future . 
  what i meant was that there was no way the courts would decide the newspaper was in any way criminally or civilly liable for what happened . 
   which fact ? 
  we 're all speculating about what the newspapers lawyers said . 
  that they printed it is a strong indicator that the lawyers said it was ok . 
  i doubt the newspaper would risk it otherwise . 
  what your private clients do is another matter , but there would be pretty strong safeguards in place at the newspaper to prevent anything serious getting through . 
  tl ; dr ** you 've misunderstood/mischaracterized my entire argument ** first , i disagreed that it was infringing on their freedom of expression in any way . 
  censoring the newspapers , however , would be a genuine example of censoring freedom of expression and the press in this instance . 
  second , i disagreed that it was a matter of right to privacy , and i based that on the fact that the newspapers lawyers gave the editors the a-ok to publish it . 
  i will take that fact as the best example that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy for those posting it . 
  it had nothing to do with me disagreeing with them politically ( though i most strongly do ) , but rather everything to do with the factors i just mentioned . 
  with respect to this thread , the newspaper is not responsible for the bombings . 
  are the two events linked ? 
  possibly . 
  but in no way does that push any part of the burden of responsibility for the bombing onto the newspaper . 
  i doubt you could find anyone reasonably versed in law that could successfully argue the point before a court of law . 
  as to your counter-factual , i really do n't think it 's equivalent in any way , at least in the way you framed it . 
  i never said the bombing of this guy was his own fault . 
  from the beginning ( as you even mentioned in your post ) i said it was solely the responsibility of the bomber , and that rather i said it was his own fault his anonymity was broken given that the information was so publicly available . 
  but if the situation to be reversed , and it all fell under the same laws , i would maintain the position i hold now - that the information and the posts were publicly available and hence there was no reasonable expectation of privacy , which i based off the fact the lawyers allowed the article to go to print . 
  there is nothing here with me being ignorant , it 's simply a matter of how the legalities of this work , and me trying to correct the people that were making incorrect statements where people were saying that it was a violation of the right to free speech ( how is removing the freedom of the press a prerequisite for freedom of speech ? 
  ) , and that they had a right to privacy ( * expensive * lawyers for one of the largest newspapers in sweden came to the conclusion they did n't ) . 
  the argument i made had nothing to do with my personal opinion on whether the newspaper should have published the names . 
  if it turns out that this goes to court and they decide that it was an invasion of privacy , i 'll happily say i was wrong . 
  given all that , please explain how i am a ` dangerous psycho ' once more . 
  that was not vacuous rhetoric . 
  you suggested that national ministers should not be able to comment on the issue truthfully to their country . 
  i would really like for you to point out where i 've been doing that , before i answer any further . 
  i do n't suppose you could elaborate on how you came to that conclusion ? 
  i would be very interested to see where you think there are instances of press censorship worse than china , or worse than on-average any other western country . 
  edit : ah , i see you 're one of those people that posts exclusively about islam , and you 've posted a bunch in the meantime without responding to this . 
  so , empty xenophobic rhetoric from you . 
  in this case , according to my swedish friend , they matched the emails of the people on the website so their personal emails . 
  almost anyone under 40 should have the knowledge and capacity to that . 
  most of what you wrote is ridiculously stupid hyperbole , mistruths , and outright bullshit , but this was very interesting . 
   various ministers from denmark , netherlands , finland , etc. 
  all had weekly spouts of `` opinions '' in the media when they should have kept their mouths shut and band together as a union . 
  so you 're saying they should n't be able to act in their democratic capacity because portuguese politicians fucked up ? 
  they 're not allowed to discuss to their constituents what their tax money is going to , because portugal fucked up it 's finances ? 
  your entire post shows a vivid lack of understanding and empathy for what the other people are going through and have to do , it 's all just me me me !, 
  well , presumably you 're linking to me . 
  i 'd be interested to know where you think i was agreeing with those actions , as opposed to me stating that i did n't believe they had any ** legal ** presumption of privacy there , that the newspaper ** is n't ** violating those peoples freedom of expression , and that i did n't believe we should start curtailing freedom of the press and expression to protect the terminally stupid that , if they had taken the slightest modicum of an interest in protecting their anonymity , would n't have been outed . 
  the only things to condemn here is the action of the bomber . 
  not to mention that early on , all such major projects are beset with teething problems that get ironed out over the course of its production life . 
  no shit , as i explained , it 's because you live in the anglophone world . 
  very nuanced . 
  in fairness , the us is n't a wild west of free speech either . 
  they have libel and false advertising laws which i feel you could essentially equate to those of not being able to deny the holocaust . 
  thanks for the response !, 
   this does though leave us in the rather unfortunate position of there being no solution to portugal 's crisis . 
  i find that 's the case in far too many crises , unfortunately . 
  ah , so you 're saying you enjoy living in an echo-chamber . 
  of course , that would make sense , that describes the majority of hardcore libertarians i 've met . 
  more than just a short term , i 'd say . 
  a slew of bankruptcies , little in the way of exports , ca n't afford imports , and they 've earned the ire of eu countries who would be less than interested in helping them . 
  portuguese private debt is running at a staggering 260 % of gdp .
