  russia does n't really have a coherent foreign policy under putin , it has a foreign catastrophe . 
  that sounds like a good idea on the surface , but you need to look at it long term . 
  do we help them build up a state that in the future might not need outside help , and whose people will have no reason to hate us and even more reason to like us ? 
  or do we let them continue what they 're doing , be a continuous source of illegal immigrants , crime , and misery whilst we stop trying to help them . 
  how ? 
  what do you want them to do ? 
  your point was that you would n't lose all global influence as an argument for why leaving the eu is a good thing . 
  you made that argument by ** lying ** and saying that the member states did n't have a seat in the wto ( i proved you wrong ) , then ** backpedalling ** by saying you meant it had no seat on the wto negotiations , then ** outright lying again ** saying that it has no influence in the eu negotiating delegation to the wto . 
  at every step of the way you 've been a deceitful git . 
  now you 're crowing as if you 've won the argument , despite the fact that it is an undeniable fact that the uk will suffer a lessened global influence as a consequence of leaving the eu , and this is by virtue of the argument i used that you think proves the case for you . 
  my , how your mind works in twisted and messed up ways . 
  apparently only some of them are politicians . 
  people are concerned that ` naming and shaming ' by the papers constitutes an unwarranted breach of privacy . 
  of course , the racists are gabbling about freedom of expression , but they always do that . 
  legitimate views ? 
  apparently what they said constitutes hate speech in sweden , making them * illegitimate views * . 
  how is it a misuse of power ? 
  there certainly are , but i think most of the voting comes from people concerned about privacy . 
  that , or this submission is being brigaded as so often happens in / r/europe . 
  apparently that kind of speech is a crime , the newspapers just found the email addresses of the people saying those things ( presumably from when they registered for the site ) and cross-checking them . 
  they found quite a few politicians and others that were breaking the law , apparently . 
  hatespeech is a crime in sweden , apparently . 
  ` hets mot folkgrupp ' , and that 's what they 're breaking . 
  because , you dishonest rat , [ the uk also has to agree to the outcome of negotiations , because the results of the negotiations are under the shared competences of the eu and it 's member states ] ( http://fdcl-berlin.de/fileadmin/fdcl/fta_peru_col/fta_eu_peru_and_colombia_mixed_agreement_en.pdf ) , leading to ` mixed agreements ' , as per article 4 of the treaty on the functioning of the eu . 
   so you 'll decide to be blind to negotiation that happens at the wto and forming a consensus . 
  you think the ec operates in a vacuum ? 
   at present , it is mainly the european commission who negotiates at the wto on behalf of the european union , representing it in the wto geneva council . 
  it coordinates with the eu member states trough the trade policy committee , and follows the guidelines stated by member states in the council of ministers , in order to better represent and protect european interests . 
  the signature of international agreements requires authorization of the council and european parliament . 
  `` the eu as an actor at the wto : its strengths and weaknesses throughout history , '' eastern journal of european studies , centre for european studies , alexandru ioan cuza university , vol . 
  3 , pages 49-66 , june . 
  you know what , let 's push aside the fact of your dishonesty about ` the uk loses it 's negotiating seat at the wto due to being part of the eu ' . 
  i know you backpedaled here and said ` no , only in negotiations ' when that is clearly not what you said , but lets look at how you 're misrepresenting the argument regardless . 
  it 's clear you do n't have an informed opinion . 
  i mean , ` the uk would be able to have a say earlier and when it 's most pertinent ' ... ? 
  what the fuck ? 
  this is a nonsensical sentence in this context , wto negotiations are n't a race and they 're not time sensitive . 
  for a wto negotiation to succeed , it has to be accepted by every single member . 
  that means that the hundred-odd non-eu members have to agree , as well as the eu seat at the wto ** and the eu member states in the wto ** . 
  the eu regularly consults with it 's member states about negotiations in the wto . 
  if the uk was unhappy with the state of wto negotiations , but everyone else was agreed , it could always prevent the deal going through . 
  but it does n't , because it conveys it 's positions to the eu which helps to negotiate on it 's behalf , because the negotiations have to reach consensus . 
  there is no ` the uk would be able to say it earlier and when it 's more pertinent ' . 
  that statement simply does not apply in any context in wto negotiations , all viewpoints are addressed at any time and it does n't matter if they 're first , last , or what have you because you need unanimity to pass negotiations . 
  so basically , you 're a downright rotten , dishonest scoundrel . 
  first , for misleading the effects of the uk leaving the wto , then backpedaling about what you meant , and finally about saying you have an informed opinion . 
  because it 's clear you have no idea what you 're talking about here . 
  i just spoke with one of my swedish friends . 
  he said they got the names by looking at the emails that were registered on avpixlat , and cross checking them with other websites . 
  it seems that all this information was freely available on the internet regardless , they were just reporting it . 
  do you mind me asking why ? 
  it seems you guys get a very very good deal staying outside , what norway and the uk could only dream of . 
  the guy is a habitual liar . 
  with respect to the wto , the eu is represented by a separate seat , whilst eu member states retain their own individual seat within the wto . 
   not quite , the wto for example has influence on what the eu does itself and being part of the eu means relinquishing your nation 's seat at the wto . 
  so arguably one can have more say earlier and when it is more pertinent . 
  once again you spread lies and misinformation . 
  why the fuck do you feel the need to do this ? 
  the wto has a special relationship with the eu and eu countries , meaning that the member-states of the eu also have their own separate seats in the wto in addition to the eu having a seat . 
  so then this is not a restriction of freedom of speech at all . 
  which has been mine ( and many others ) arguments all along . 
  the state has had no influence in this case . 
  i notice you did n't address the point . 
  it seemed obvious to the racists and xenophobes in australia as well , until the statistics came out that most of them were actually genuine refugees . 
  many of them , maybe . 
  i do n't know . 
  i know that in australia over the past decade , somewhere around 90 % + of those arriving are deemed to be genuine refugees . 
  how do you know the vast majority are n't persecuted ? 
  i was trying to explain why someone might think it was a neonazi organization or some such , i was n't saying it was . 
  as usual vityok , the second you see something that goes against your personal beliefs your go on a crazy overreaction . 
  how is it not freedom of speech ? 
  haha , fair enough !, 
   these people are n't . 
  how do you know that ? 
  have you processed their claims ? 
  that was by a government organization . 
  this is a journalistic organization , for which special exemptions have been provided for . 
  i think you are misunderstanding , this was not data collected by the government . 
  well , i 'm not terribly well acquainted with swedish law , but i 'm tending towards this being legal based off the fact that newspapers lawyers tend to not let them publish something if it were illegal . 
  edit : do you have something else written there a minute ago ? 
  i swear you did ... 
  regardless , this is a place where i think we disagree on what constitutes a reasonable right to privacy in a public online forum . 
  also in the same place  member states shall provide for exemptions or derogations from the provisions of this chapter , chapter iv and chapter vi for the processing of personal data carried out solely for journalistic purposes or the purpose of artistic or literary expression only if they are necessary to reconcile the right to privacy with the rules governing freedom of expression . 
  it 's not illegal . 
  ah , is this the tired old ` youths is code for immigrants ! ', 
  he did n't make an argument about that , he made an argument asking how it contradicted someone 's right to free speech . 
  if a newspaper is investigating a story on racism online , and they link accounts to people , how is that a register ? 
  edit in response to your edit . 
  you 're going to have to show me something specific in what you linked to prove that a newspaper is not allowed to conduct such an investigation , i do n't have time to read through the entirety . 
  that 's usually not necessarily because of the church , but rather because of their own prejudices . 
  at least in poland . 
  by the government , sure . 
  by locals , not so much . 
  there is no register of people based on their opinion . 
  a newspaper managed to link the identities of accounts making opinions like that with the people , and wrote a newspaper article on that . 
  where are you getting this whole ` register ' thing from ? 
  the ukrainian insurgent army committed a number of atrocities during the second world war , but it 's also one of the symbol of ukrainian independence and does n't necessarily denote that they are neo-nazis . 
  well then perhaps you can tell me how this contradicts western liberal-democratic norms of free speech , because i really do not understand . 
  unless you 're suggesting that freedom of speech is not being allowed to report what someone said when they were exercising their right to free speech . 
  all media you consume has some bias .
