  what is this , the 12th century ? 
  i 'm not basing my actions on that , i 'm explaining why people do it . 
  and also , the losses in inflation are relative losses , yes maybe not everything gets more expensive , but it 's still a. 
  relative loss , not to mention the opportunity cost of keeping it in the bank . 
  le monde diplomatique is very good as well , a pity it 's a monthly ( and just a translation of the french articles ) . 
  because most of these people invested before they were aware there was a bubble . 
  regardless , there 's a saying in the anglophone world , and in many other countries , which is ` safe as houses ' . 
  that is , if there 's a big economic crisis again and stockmarkets , bond markets , etc , are all wiped out , you still have the title and deed to property . 
  as for inflation , if you have 100,000 in the bank , and the inflation rate is 5 % a year , you 've basically lost about 5,000 after a year is over . 
  people do n't want to lose money , they want to keep it in line with inflation , hence they invest in houses which are the absolute best way to do that . 
  if you have 100,000 spare , and a house cost 500,000 dollars , it 's far better to take a loan and invest in a house to keep your money safe , than lose it to inflation . 
  are these necessarily reforms that should be made at the eu level though ? 
  the eu provides policy vision and guidance , along with some ( very ) broad outlines , but implementation ( including allocating how and where to spend money ) is on the member states . 
  something like 97 % of the eu 's funds are disbursed to member states to implement that policy . 
  what could they reasonably do ? 
  it 's not necessarily that they think they will make a profit from it . 
  it 's that any other ways they invest their money get very heavily taxed and are a lot more risky . 
  that is very , very , few people . 
  no one wants to keep their money in cash , so they put it into different investment options . 
  some goes into stocks , others into bonds , but usually it goes into property . 
  people often own three houses and having loans on each one , because rising property rates and rent means they make money over the long run , they do n't want to lose out on opportunity cost . 
  saw it and upvoted it about 6 hours ago !, 
  alright , lets examine who is dishonest here . 
  i have said , repeatedly over the last months , that you have a terrible habit of misrepresenting other peoples arguments and presenting strawmen . 
  in sum , dishonest as hell . 
  let 's see where you 're doing that right here . 
  i 'll be taking direct quotes , except for where there were no quotes to take due to your rampant strawmanning . 
  ** your claim : ** this is you saying that the german automotive industry and lobbyists do n't have a say/influence in german politics ** what i actually said : ** you seem to be of the opinion that political power is static . 
  that the german car lobby is always too powerful for confrontation . 
  i know that neither of these are true , and that even now the chancellor could go against car manufacturers interests if she thought there was more to gain . 
  clearly , i never said they have no say or influence , i said that if the german government thought there was more to gain going against them , they would . 
  ** verdict : ** you 're lying . 
  you 're dishonest . 
  ** your claim : ** are you really asking us to believe that you did n't know you do n't need a political union to have trade ? 
  ** what i actually said : ** well , here 's the thing . 
  nowhere there , or anywhere else , did i make any such claim . 
  so in sum , you 're bringing up strawmen you deceitful git . 
  ** verdict : ** strawman . 
  you 're dishonest . 
  ** your claim : ** or that the eu already has trade agreements with countries they 're not in political union with ? 
  ** what i actually said : ** again , i made no such claim . 
  ** verdict : ** strawman . 
  you 're dishonest . 
  please , bring up more supposed ` examples ' of my dishonesty ( with quotes , mine and yours ) as i love using them to prove how you 're the dishonest one here . 
  because it destroys value in the economy . 
  if property prices drop uniformly by 25 % , all those people in the country that had land have lost 25 % of the face value of their property . 
  so if they try and sell it , they get less than what they maybe bought it for , or got the loan for . 
  it 's not even usually or always the super rich , or even the rich , that own property , so now you have a bunch of people that have houses that are worth less than the loan is for ( and are now in net debt ) that they have to pay loan interest on ( if they 're not bankrupted ) , meaning less spending on consumption and the economy gets worse . 
  the populist kind of ` bankers suck ! ', 
  ` it 's not democracy unless it 's direct democracy ' etc bullshit is common in this subreddit , do n't worry about it . 
   because it 's better to have incompetent human beings than competent sadists . 
  very well said !, 
  it 's not threatening to shut off the entire pipeline , it 's threatening to not let them purchase any . 
  if they steal it ( you can tell drops in volume on the outgoing end , even accounting for natural leakage ) , then there could be some serious ramifications for ukraine , possible even military ones if it their relations get bad enough . 
  well , maybe not new zealand . 
  pretty sure that place is worse than turkmenistan . 
  you have no idea how much i love this . 
  trust me , you did n't spend too much time making it . 
  you see this problem with the russian nationalists on this subreddit as well . 
  ` russia bullies ukraine ' ` well the jews exterminated the canaanites , so you 're a massive fucking hypocrite ' . 
  well , i did n't say i was for liquid democracy , i said i was interested in the concept . 
  regardless , i think we need a radical overhaul of democratic systems to bring them up to date with modern technology , the ease of access of information , the 24-hour media cycle , and the like . 
  but one thing i do know is that i 'm not for simplistic and populist direct democracy . 
  less opportunity lately ? 
  it 's bizarre to me as well that you call me dishonest . 
  the only person that could be attributed to is you , given how you were destroyed in the past argument with / u/bowgentle , yet keep bringing up the argument about the lisbon/constitutional treaty thing and misinterpreting/misrepresenting our arguments . 
  you are the dishonest one , you get proven wrong time after time but repeat the same arguments as if they 're magically still true . 
  incidentally , how many times have you downvoted me now ? 
  if you 're quick , you 'll corner the market !, 
  i 've had fullers before , i remain unimpressed . 
  frankly , i 've experienced little of note from the uk beyond brewdog , but i 'll admit i have n't tried as many british beers as i probably should 've . 
  if i were n't currently living in a country where microbrewing is in it 's infancy , i 'd propose a beer exchange !, 
  i spent about 1700 dkk ordering mikkeller and to ol beers online last month , have a nice little collection sitting in the back of my cupboard . 
  it 's dwindling a little faster than i 'd hoped , though ... 
  well , now that polandball is bigger i guess we should keep / r/europe a secret instead , right ? 
  would you complain if you joined a baking sub that said ` for those that love ovens ' on the sidebar ? 
  only african country with an aircraft carrier . 
  do it first , keep the edge !, 
  the guy is a homophobic , xenophobic , hardcore nationalist polish dude who blames most of polands problems on jews . 
  greece owes many countries in europe billions of euros . 
  media certainly played up the german leadership of bailout arrangements and continued debt issuance , but the money was loaned by most , if not all , eu countries . 
  no , what i did was come in and said it was hilarious that you , the king of alarmism on / r/europe , would find it astouding . 
  then you brought up past arguments and accused me of being dishonest . 
  this is on you . 
  i had a british mate that was a green a few years ago . 
  if he 's the type that were running things there , it 's completely understandable they 'd lose power . 
  i was n't blanket insulting , i was giving ( what i thought ) was an accurate description of you . 
  no shit , the point being * it 's not a constitutional treaty * . 
  which is a massive difference . 
  no , because only those that live there * might * have that sentiment , and they especially would n't if they see anti-polish articles such as the bbc special on football hooliganism in poland and all the media fear about the place . 
  it 's not about a positive image , it 's about ' a force for good ' . 
  well , that 's my point . 
  this is what shapes polish perceptions of britain , and them seeing anti-polish articles and fear about how unsafe poland was going to be during the eurocup shifted their perceptions to thinking the uk was n't a force for good . 
  right , the format , meaning it 's no longer a * constitutional treaty * which would be a massive step in eu integration , but rather the same kind of treaty as the past ones . 
  i really do not comprehend how you can not recognize how truly momentous a difference this is , despite much of the content remaining the same . 
  beyond that , the berlusconi years were a marked period of stagnation in italy . 
  most of the past decade , italy was under the control of berlusconi who simply did n't give a toss about the eu . 
  given that most peoples perception of power relations amongst eu countries are shaped by the last decade , i think this will also give a pretty good explanation of why italy is n't seen as a major power . 
  because ` it 's nice to live there and i make good money ' does not equate to ` it 's a force for good ' . 
  regardless , there are some historical hang-ups as well - many poles still have a light grudge about yalta , and the stuff about britain that reaches polish media ( usually complaints about polish immigrants , or stuff like the extremely biased bbc thing about football hooligans during the eurocup ) is of the brits looking down on the poles .
