  well , that would be great if , for example , they could get to those countries or if those countries were n't already filled with refugees . 
  lebanon has over one million syrian refugees , a country with a population of about 4 million . 
  that 's one in five people . 
  anyone that thinks that europe has a refugee crisis clearly does n't know what the fuck they 're talking about . 
  libya is still a destabilized hell-hole from the toppling of qaddafi . 
  for the refugees to get to egypt , they 'd have to either cross israel/palestine ( good luck ) , or fine a boat that 's heading to egypt - as if there 's that much two-way cargo between the two countries . 
  or if they could lead some kind of stable , safe , lives in those countries rather than worrying every day about where their next meal comes from . 
  to understand their motives , you need to look at it from their point of view . 
  they go to countries like sweden because these countries are bastions of stability . 
  they know that they , and their kids , can have some sort of a life there , as opposed to the half-life they 'd have in the other countries where refugee camps lack basic facilities , and where there is chronic uncertainty about their future . 
   take for example sweden . 
  what do they think will happen when they say `` we will give asylum to every syrian refugee that can get to sweden '' . 
  did anyone ask themselves how they get to sweden ? 
  how many dies in the mediterranean on the way ? 
  how many are killed by human smugglers ? 
  probably considerably fewer than would 've died in syria . 
  so you 're saying we should dump them in somalia like europe dumped it 's nuclear waste and so on ? 
  troll , ignore . 
  just a troll , ignore . 
  i do n't read the guardian either , but i 'm pretty sure the bbc does n't censor anything about muslims . 
  you 're just a racist . 
  it 's at two points for me at the moment . 
  but i think most people just object to telegraph reporting on the eu , given that it 's displayed a flagrant bias against it in the past and frequently misrepresents what 's going on . 
  [ quote from the op ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/2i9phd/parents_confront_head_at_birmingham_trojan_horse/cl0go7z ) :  i ca n't believe we 've gone from the nation that beat back the nazis to allowing these bastard invaders to dictate how our country is run :( i truly hate muslims , i hate what they 're doing to our countries . 
  but i hate the left who let them in even more . 
  just thought it was interesting . 
  also , there 's nothing in the story that said it happened because the head teacher was n't pushing islam in the school , but whatever . 
  case in point , my comment is at -2 saying that the bias is generally pretty even in this subreddit . 
  my assumption is that most of them are n't used to being challenged about their negative views on the eu , so any positive comments seem to be disproportionate to them . 
  like hell it is . 
  it 's about 55-45 pro/anti eu . 
  i do n't think it 's really fair to say ` whoosh ' to an obscure reference from northern ireland on a european forum, 
  how 's that ? 
  / u/jrohila is someone that starts frothing at the mouth whenever immigrants or muslims are mentioned , so this response is unsurprising . 
  more pseudo-intellectual prattle that fundamentally misses the point - which is that culture is not a ` thing ' , it is a belief about a ` thing ' , meaning that everyone 's interpretation is different . 
  there may be some prevailing trends , but they are by no means rules , nor are they necessary or even just sufficient conditions that have to be met . 
  you treat culture as if it is something set in stone , something stable , as opposed to merely a collection of people 's interpretations of rapidly shifting and changing beliefs about a nebulously defined group of people , hence why you think it is something that can be deconstructed with logic and made to fit however you want . 
  it 's not , there is no ` logic ' to culture and there is no system . 
  was n't it actually started on here by / u/txampion or someone ? 
  what a joke . 
  culture is not a mathematical equation , it ca n't be quantified and there are as many interpretations of what a countries culture is as there are people that have heard of that country . 
  your attempt of using fluid dynamics to demonstrate why ` multiculturalism ' is wrong is simply idiotic and there are no useful parallels between the two . 
  to put it bluntly , you wrote a lot but said little . 
  edit : it 's also amusing how you say ` you and your ilk ' as if you knew what my position was . 
  it 's funny how easily some people jump to generalizations at the drop of a hat . 
  it 's not a matter of being politically correct , it 's a matter of you being an outright racist . 
  you were about a 4 on the racism scale before , now you 've shot straight up to a 10 . 
  good day to you . 
  the cronulla riots were n't about ` muslim rape gangs ' , and they were greatly exaggerated by the media . 
  the riots that happened were in large part also organized by racist and fascist groups . 
  you should learn about a subject before you speak . 
  the ` white australia policy ' did allow non-whites in , it was just more difficult , and it was only * finally * dismantled in the 70s . 
  it began the process of that years earlier . 
  i also know of countless ` non-whites ' in australia that are more integrated that ` eastern europeans ' in the uk , so it 's clearly not a matter of integration to you but rather one of white vs non-white . 
  i also do n't know of any riots because of ` muslim rapes gangs ' in australia, 
  and where did i say that you were racist because of ` not wanting swedes to be a minority ' ? 
  australia accepted a number of refugees from czechoslovakia ( and greece ! ), 
  over the last century . 
  should we not have accepted them given that we 're an oceanic country , and not a european country ? 
  greeks were living under a military dictatorship and the czechs were under a communist government , we should have only let refugees from democratic countries in because they would better assimilate to our political order and we have more in common with them politically . 
  that line of logic is as batshit retarded as yours . 
  it 's not that you do n't want refugees , it 's just that you 're a racist . 
  you 're generalizing millions of people on the basis that they 're not white europeans and so you think they would not be able to assimilate as well . 
  refugees deserve protection regardless of where they 're from . 
  i presume you can link to that discussion then ? 
  because you have a habit of coming into threads and making shit up - calling me a ` marxist ' when if anything , my posts on the ttip display me as anything but . 
  saying i 'm an ` open borders advocate ' despite me numerous times saying that those that claiming asylum and are n't deemed to be refugees should be deported . 
  you do n't have anything to back up your arguments so you resort to making shit up . 
  what makes a refugee from syria less deserving of protection ? 
  you realize that ` refugee ' has a specific meaning right ? 
  it does n't just mean what you want it to mean ? 
  amusing , considering how many refugees fled czechoslovakia between 1939-1990 . 
  sweden is n't committing ` cultural suicide ' , whatever the fuck that means . 
  it 's also used for legitimate humanitarian intervention , such as in the solomon islands , timor leste , and mali . 
  it wo n't just be us lng . 
  the polish mentality : look in history for good things , look in the present for bad things . 
  pretty disappointing , but unsurprising given the sweden seems to have been slowly turning away from nuclear for some time now . 
  `` far right '' is usually used to denote xenophobic , populist and reactionary parties when using english . 
  it 's not determined by their economic or social leaning . 
  so you did n't read the article ? 
  it 's not the ruling coalition that wants to ban it , it 's a few academics suggesting that that 's what the ruling coalition should do . 
  so it 's not the swedish ruling coalition that advocates this , it 's a few academics recommending that that 's what the ruling coalition do . 
  because i 'm not referring to [ false balance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/false_balance ) . 
  trade liberalization is a pretty objective good and bernadette segol and monique goyens are not opposed , but have strong reservations on various aspects . 
  if you watch through the entire thing , you 'll notice they criticize many aspects of the negotiating procedure , isds , and the like . 
  i 've also never heard anyone claim that trade unions and consumer organizations having a big interest in ttip happening , so at least we have a first there as well . 
  schroeder lost all credibility years ago . 
  a well balanced , moderated , and interesting debate with some important european figures on the ttip participants : ** bernadette s\u00e9gol ** , secretary general , european trade union confederation ( etuc ) ** markus j. beyrer ** , director general , businesseurope ** stephen fidler ** of wall street journal ( moderator ) ** carl martin welcke ** r , vice president , german engineering association ( vdma ) ; company owner and manager , sch\u00fctte gmbh & co kg ** monique goyens ** , director general , european consumer organisation ( beuc ), 
  mate , your posts are just becoming embarrassing at this stage . 
  the isis flag is n't and arab flag ... 
  the russian intervention in georgia demonstrated the the top brass numerous issues with the state of russia 's armed forces . 
  one of them said that if they had amphibious assault ships they would 've been able to completely occupy georgia in 20 hours , as opposed to the five days it lasted . 
   i thought any asylum seeker had to apply in the first eu country he reached ? 
  they just have to be processed at the first eu country reached , albeit with a long list of exceptions . 
  chapter three of the dublin 3 agreement , if i recall correctly . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hs0te/some_of_you_asked_so_heres_wind_power_per_capita/ckvk8u3?context=2 ) thread of comments seems to indicate i was correct , but i know / u/barsoap as one of the more intelligent posters in / r/europe so i 'll eagerly await his reply to / u/cxmetal !, 
  my time is valuable , i 'm not going to waste it reading another one of your poorly sourced , heavily biased , and misinterpreted links . 
  presumably thanks to rule 6 :  this is a moderated forum , to maintain a civil environment , ** and a high level of debate . 
  we reserve the right to actively moderate the subreddit as is reasonable , to achieve those aims .
