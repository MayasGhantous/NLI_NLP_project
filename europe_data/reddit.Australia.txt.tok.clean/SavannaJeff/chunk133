  yeah , but then you 'd just burn them again . 
  if i had to choose between hundreds of burnt down rainbows , or tanks , i 'd go for the tanks !, 
  damn elk gangs , coming in from abroad , not contributing to society . 
  they 're all just criminals anyway , barely even people !, 
  seriously , every stupid elk i 've met has been begging , or stealing . 
  the association agreement is not the same thing as an agreement to join the eu . 
  i 'm saying you 're not intelligent enough to understand what you 're talking about . 
  touched a nerve ? 
  that was n't me in any way ` having a nerve touched ' , it was me explaining why you have a juvenile state of mind . 
  it has to do with how terrible your thought process is , how there 's no nuance or subtelty , that you connections only make broad logical sense , rather than specific , and that you seem to have a need to simplify the world into really simple concepts . 
  you 're really young , are n't you ? 
  so you prefer to let a large number of people become homeless , turn to crime , and become a burder on informal support networks such as family ? 
  to cut down on healthy food and become a burden on health care ? 
  to have malnourished children whose brains dont develop and cant contribute to society ? 
  he 's not a troll , he 's a libertarian . 
  that 's worse . 
  i had no idea that you poms said seppo as well !, 
  but yeah , he 's a libertarian and they tend to be yanks . 
  you think it takes mere months to learn a trade ? 
  and your solution seems to be to cut their benefits , so instead relatives spend more of their money on taking care of those that ca n't find a job , else they become homeless or turn to crime creating more problems . 
  are you really going to make bullshit libertarian arguments , such as taxes = slavery ? 
  you mean for being racist , a hardcore nationalist , and a xenophobe ? 
  oh wow , that makes so much sense now !, 
  no individual has the information and capacity to know which skill is under/over saturated in the market , which is economically viable in their city , etc. 
  unless your planning some kind of state allocation of workers or something ... 
  there 's a general rule of the internet , that whenever you see a website or a username that has the word ` neutral ' ` balanced ' ` moderate ' , etc , they never are . 
  you 're surprised there are only 200 protestors in donetsk , given it 's a majority ethnic russian and russophone town ? 
  because he has none . 
  he 's a russian apologist . 
  the slightest whiff of criticism of russia , and the guy jumps straight in to their defense . 
  because there has to be an institutional process before we determine to kill people , else the possibilities for abuse are too high . 
  i 'd say you did a good job of it !, 
  i was in feldkirch a few years ago , beautiful town . 
  i suppose you can point to some examples ? 
  i 've seen nothing of the sort there . 
  i 'm full up on the delusions of grandeur already , sorry . 
  that would make more sense , but i do n't think anyone ever accused the english language of logical consistency !, 
  what ? 
  you can thank / u/neoliberal for a bunch of those , i 've been linked there by him once or twice . 
  well , at least from my side you 've been upvoted at least three times in the past . 
  quisling was the norwegian that launched a coup in norway and collaborated with the germans during ww2 . 
  his name is used synonymously for traitor . 
  on central asia , they 're already pretty much allies . 
  there 's some minor competition , but they 're in a happy medium at the moment and cooperate in a number of regional bodies there ( such as the shanghai cooperation organization ) . 
  beyond that , they tend to agree in the unsc ( particularly on matters of sovereignty ) and can be found usually backing eachother up . 
  yep , one need only take a look at [ this submission ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1r4ty5/get_the_picture_do_you_identify_with_todays_europe/cdjyjrg?context=3 ) to see the lack of discussion worthy anti-eu sentiments , and why they get downvoted . 
  at least 20 % of turkeys population lives geographically in europe . 
  what do you mean by ` listen to the people ' exactly ? 
  truly a tremendous loss for the carrier pigeon community . 
  it 's been opening up since '78 and will continue to do so . 
  that it still has restrictions is beside the point , the country has gained tremendously thanks to freer trade . 
  well , i just did a quick search and came across [ this article ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/norway-s-wealth-not-just-oil\u200e ) written by a [ prominent icelandic economist ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thorvaldur_gylfason ) who suggests that it 's not the popularly held belief that norway is rich because of resources that 's correct , but rather that it was human capital accumulation . 
  yes , sorry , i misread after seeing his figure of 30 % for oil ( which is what it makes up in exports ) . 
  your numbers are off , they should be 0.05 difference in the first instance , for example . 
  he 's a norwegian hardcore russophile that thinks that there 's a global conspiracy of western governments and the media to portray russia as a backwards country run by an authoritarian regime that frequently bullies it 's neighbours , is riddled with human rights abuses , and a moribund economy . 
  in actuality , russia is a paradise and can do no wrong . . 
  well , it 's a good thing that before the british army chooses to kill people , someone has to * at least * point at them and say ` they 're the bad guys ' before they do it !, 
   de-nationalize you mean privatize ? 
  is it ? 
  i mean , it might seem obvious , but have you read any academic papers that clearly states that ? 
  england is the greatest country on earth , we do n't need no eu , british culture is best culture , piss off johnny foreigner , etc. 
  as members of the wto , russia has to treat ukraine as it would treat any other country it does n't have any privileged trade agreements with ( such as belarus and kazakhstan ) . 
  because it discusses the uses of the shortening of national socialism to nazi , as well as historical usages for the word . 
  the article is not about the nsdap or it 's policies themselves . 
  you 're linking to 2012 articles . 
  it 's 2013 now . 
  i posted articles from this year . 
  as for growth better than eastern europe , well ... yeah . 
  oil is at a high point above $ 100/barrel . 
  50 % of russias economy is dependent on energy/mineral exports . 
  eastern europe does n't have that . 
  but that 's beside the point . 
  the russian economy should be performing at over 5 % / year , it 's one of the ` bric 's after all . 
  it 's going to be around half that this year , and their economy is riddled with problems and needs some serious structural changes to fix them . 
  many reforms . 
  the country definitely wo n't be ready for at least 40 years . 
  what ? 
  the russian economy is stagnating . 
  there was capital flight of almost 50 billion dollars from russia just in the first three quarters of the year . 
  business investment is plummeting . 
  [ private consumption is tapering off . 
  ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21589455-will-stagnating-economy-bring-about-much-needed-structural-reform-s-word ) you said macroeconomic forecasts are looking better than ever [ when the opposite is demonstrably true ] ( http://businessdayonline.com/2013/11/russias-new-stagnation-2/ ) . 
  for what russia is , it should be pulling weight way above what it currently is . 
  you 're so adorable . 
  this would also make great polandball material . 
  they killed at least 10 unarmed civilians , not even ira members . 
  they committed summary executions of people they could 've locked up instead . 
  you 're saying that 's justified ? 
  great post !, 
  he asked where you were from , saying that it might be correlated with greater levels of people not feeling ` european ' . 
  i brought up that you were british , and a quote by a historical leader of yours ( by many , considered your greatest leader ) . 
  if you think that 's racist , then you 're going to have to throw out half three quarters of the social science departments at every university around the world . 
  i thought maybe you 'd redeemed yourself when you stopped following me around and writing bullshit , as per your last account that was banned here . 
  i see i was mistaken . 
  time to add you to the ignore list once more . 
  the topic was if you identify as european . 
  [ here 's a link ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1r4ty5/get_the_picture_do_you_identify_with_todays_europe/cdjwfjp ) to a post in this very thread where someone does n't have pro-european sentiment , and it 's sitting at 4-0 . 
  now lets look at the downvoted opinions :  eurozone is like a malformed usa where evreyone do what the state of ny decide and there is no federal welfare or fiscal tranfer . 
  this is obvioulsy going to end one way or another . 
  or  i do n't .
