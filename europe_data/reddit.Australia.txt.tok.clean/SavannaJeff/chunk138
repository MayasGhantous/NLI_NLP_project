   kindly prove it . 
  you mean the examples i 've listed of at least 4 different mps behaving appalingly , or leadership positions constantly being filled with racist thugs , and an article explaining their racist past is n't enough ? 
  how about that they have a history of getting a [ solid portion of their funding from known racists ] ( http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/sverigedemokraterna-far-miljoner-av-rik-rasist/ ) ? 
   again with blatant ignorance . 
  the left and right regularly votes with sd on many issues . 
  the far left votes with them on issues of animal rights and preventing more tax cuts for non-workers for instance . 
  the moderates vote with them on many issues . 
  in fact the only issue where they do n't get support in is their immigration and integration views . 
  what absolute junk . 
  it 's not that if sd votes one way , everyone else votes the other . 
  it 's a careful balancing act to limit the influence of sd to as little as possible . 
   point out which it was literally in the article linked . 
  the rest of your post is absolute blather , and i wo n't be responding to you again here . 
  but to sum up - it 's a party that has it 's roots in deep racism , where a significant portion of its leadership has been or are being revealed as out-and-out racists , and that is heavily funded by racists . 
  it may be trying to clean up it 's ` image ' , but even if you polish a turd it remains a turd . 
  your only counterarguments have been ` but you 're a foreigner ' , ` but you hate scandinavians ' ( which is ridiculously untrue given that many of my friends are swedes , i took the trouble to learn the language , and i 'm returning again in june ) , and ` but all those people who publicly revealed the party as being full of racists are n't in the party anymore , except for those who are ! ' . 
  what an absolute fucking joke . 
   funny considering most of them have n't said anything more bigoted than you tend to do when talking about scandinavians . 
  i 'm bigoted against scandinavians , am i ? 
   that led to them getting expelled from their posts and the guy with the pipe was expelled from the party pretty much immediately . 
  sd even soared in the ratings because of how incredibly well they handled the aftermath when the media was trying with immense glee to paint them all out as thugs when anyone with eyes can see that they 're not . 
  these were n't just nobodies . 
  there were the ** economics ** and ** justice ** spokespeople . 
  pretty high up the food chain people . 
  you can try and whitewash it with ` oh , they were just some bad apples ' , but it 's actually a systemic infection of the entire joke of a political party . 
  there 's a reason every other party in parliament outright refuses to associate with them to the point that the opposition votes in favour of government bills to make sure that sd has n't had a controlling say , and that 's because the party is rotten to the very fucking core . 
  the leaders of sds youth wing wrote in support of the two , saying they shouldnt have caved into media pressure and removed them . 
  regardless , these fucking thugs ** were n't even expelled from the party ** , they were just removed from prominent posts . 
  no , they do n't expel violent racists and thugs from the party , they only push people out of the party for ` alcoholism ' such as with william petz\u00e4ll . 
  of course , i heard the real reason from one of my right leaning swedish friends was because he was for the decriminalization of drugs , but whatever . 
  running around abusing strangers , threatening people with lead pipes is for more acceptable , civilized behaviour than alcohlism , no ? 
   name some . 
  it 'd be interesting to what else you think you know . 
  what i think i know ? 
  well , there 's [ this other mp from the sd ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20130426/47570 ) who refers to darker skinned people as monkeys . 
  then there 's the charming story of the sd mp who [ claimed to have been robbed and mugged by immigrants ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20121129/44726 ) , when it actually turned out he 'd left his backpack at a restaurant and the two immigrants were helping him get back into his wheelchair . 
  the very same charming fellow abused guards at the riksdag as well . 
  but he was kicked out of the party . 
  his behaviour was ` uncivilized ' , unlike the guys who abuse foreign-looking people , harass women , and arm themselves with lead pipes to beat people up . 
  links from thelocal , sure , but it 's the only decent site on swedish news in english . 
  and if you can read swedish as welll , there 's the entirety of [ this article ] ( http://expo.se/2011/sa-ljuger-sd-om-sin-historia_3612.html ) to explain their racism as well . 
  these people are n't teddybears . 
  they 're people with strong ties to nazism . 
   because sd is so well known for physical assaults . 
  they have all of , what is it now , zero attacks made on anyone ? 
  they truly are saints . 
   you know for someone that gets immensely upset when anyone criticizes australia 's immigration policy and tony abbot getting elected your attitude very much smacks of `` let me tell you about your country '' on any given subject . 
  the difference is , i lived in sweden for a little over two years , learnt the language quite well , and had a swedish girlfriend . 
  i actually know what the fuck i 'm talking about when it comes to sweden , unlike your little racist norwegian friend who knew butt-fuck all about australia . 
  amazing that you 're getting so many downvotes for stating facts . 
  what ? 
  the demonization of sd is due to them being fucking crazy , there has been controvery after controversy about them over how crazily racist they are where [ even their supposedly respectable mps run around harassing foreign-looking people with slurs and blunt objects ] ( https://danielerikvalentin.wordpress.com/tag/sverigedemokraterna/ ) , let alone dozens of other incidents over the past decade . 
  a significant portion of the party has tried to play off as reasonable immigration critics , but at it 's core it 's populated by violent thugs . 
  [ it 's the same kind of fascist thuggery that golden dawn is known for , such as physically assaulting female members of the opposition during a live debate ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/jun/07/greek-golden-dawn-mp-hits-opponent-tv-video ), 
  for what you 've said , that sounds like a pretty good fit , else i 'd suggest stockholm-tallinn-riga . 
  from yours though , i 'd perhaps sub out berlin or prague for krakow , however . 
  those cities are great and all , i plan on living in berlin one day , but i feel the three cities share a certain je nais se quoi which might make be better broken up by going to a city that has n't been dominated by germanic rule for over 500 years, 
  excellent point , well made . 
  yes , i get that , but what do * you * mean by it . 
  and what does that mean , exactly ? 
  coming from australia , very weird . 
  back in melbourne i think i had a jewish kid in one of my classes in every year of schooling . 
  that 's a 2014 forecast on the economist site , not current , hence the discrepancy . 
  the change between the 2013 and 2014 gdp forecast is really warming , though of course should be taken with a grain of salt . 
  as to budget balance , poland , wtf ? 
  unless you 're servicing some crazy high interest debt , they must have a budget surplus of five percent or so !, 
  well , at least in australia 's case , i think it went from ` are you stupid , or what ? ', 
  and we just dropped the ` what ' at the end out of laziness . 
  but regardless , grammar rules tend to blur a bit when you get into spoken english . 
  it 's one of those things you notice when you learn it , not otherwise . 
  you realise that a lot of swedish grammar is similar to old english , and if you pronounce the words accordingly you notice them a lot more . 
  it took me about 6 months to lose that kind of stuff since moving to europe . 
  unfortunately , i 've lost much of my australian accent and my english vocab has suffered tremendously , but i 've managed to pick up 1.75 languages in the meantime so i 'm not overly fussed . 
  nah , actually , that one 's fine in english , or at least is common in australia . 
  yeah , but unfortunately that does n't always work out for you guys . 
  * every * single swede i 've spoken to has made the mistake of translating ` smakar inte mycket ' to ` does n't taste much ' , instead of the more correct ` it 's bland ' , or , ` it does n't have much flavour ' . 
  sure , but i was n't hanging around in touristy places or what have you , i was studying and meeting the locals ( typically students ) . 
  that would n't surprise me . 
  just because i know how to use the language , does n't mean i know why it works . 
  yep , completely agree . 
  there were a couple of times when i was in stockholm or uppsala and i could n't tell if the person was swedish or american . 
  i spent a lot of time in skane 3-4 years ago ( outside malmo ) . 
  most people did not speak fantastic english there , but they could get by . 
  krakow , actually , and spent a bunch of time in warsaw . 
  so yeah , the two largest cities with the most university aged students . 
  ah , i 'm drawing my conclusions from my experiences travelling extensively through germany a couple of times ( including through many smaller towns ) , compared to living in poland for two years . 
  but , for example , i would no classify szczecin as a major city , it 's not even half a million people . 
  i think it depends on where . 
  in major cities , i 'd say that young poles speak better than young germans do . 
  but average it out to include all the small towns and village , and then your average german youth would speak better . 
  so you 're saying that the people that the roman empire bought or defeated into their fold only destroyed the roman empire because they were made citizens ? 
  on the topic of closed communities , that 's usually due to economics . 
  at least in australia 's experience , immigrants tend to come in waves . 
  a short burst of greek immigrants following ww2 , then some vietnamese , then some yugoslavian , lately iraqi and afghan . 
  and since they come in waves , a big group of people tries to find the cheapest places they can live , which is how enclaves within cities form . 
  they do n't have the same support networks as locals do ( long standing family and friends , plus in most cases some wealth along with it ) so staying in these communities of people that share common experiences also becomes like an extended support network they can rely on further cementing the ghettoization . 
  unfortunately , what can governments do to spread them out ? 
  force them to live in an area where maybe it 's difficult to get a job ? 
  give them free housing on nicer neighbourhoods to spread them out ? 
  a lot of it is politically unpalatable or unfairly cramping the liberty many of these refugees escaped for .
