  but they ca n't , except in the case of isds provisions where foreign companies can do so . 
  i 'm not going to comment on your hypothetical egg scenario because we simply do n't know what 's going to be subject to isds provisions and what is n't . 
  i would oppose provisions that made legal changes for the sake of animal welfare actionable under isds . 
  regardless , i do n't think they would be entitled to compensation because it would n't be unfairly favouring domestic egg companies ( as they would be required to follow the same regulations ) . 
  sorry , i edited something into my reply just as you replied . 
  but the paper is old , i posted it merely to demonstrate that sovereign immunity was a valid concept in civil law countries . 
  yes it did rule on it if you 'll check the post you just replied to . 
  i agree that sovereign immunity sucks , but it 's the reason why isds provisions are used . 
  because without isds provisions , they have no way of suing the government when the government does wrong . 
  people are also those that own the companies . 
  the shareholders , those employed by the company , etc. 
  why should the government be allowed to , in effect , steal from them just because it can ? 
  are n't they entitled some compensation when a government puts in a law that is unfairly prejudicial against them ? 
  when governments take land under eminent domain , they give compensation then . 
  why not when they do it like this as well ? 
  except you 're not some kind of rare genius , you 're a nutter . 
  quit reddit for a month , learn to communicate effectively , and then try again . 
  because at the moment there is little point having a discussion with you when you do n't try and display whatever tangential logical connections you make . 
  it very much does exist in civil law countries . 
  [ here 's an academic text on it ] ( http://ejil.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/4/853.full )  the icj in particular accepted that a right to sovereign immunity exists . 
  it thus did not come as a surprise when on 23 december 2008 germany instituted proceedings against italy before the icj based on a violation of its ( alleged ) right to sovereign immunity in civil proceedings .6 following the verdict of that case , the icj [ upheld that sovereign immunity ] ( http://www.herbertsmithfreehills.com/-/media/hs/l-080312-18.pdf ) is a fundamental principle of international law . 
  i do n't mean to be rude , but if you do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about then do n't make shit up . 
  you 've only asked me once , and then - as now , i 'll tell you again . 
  i 'm not a neoliberal . 
  well they ca n't at the moment thanks to [ sovereign immunity ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereign_immunity ) . 
  that 's why isds clauses are so popular . 
  [ this case ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2hfkpf/germany_wants_investment_clause_scrapped_in/cksc00b ) . 
  they 'd just have to pay compensation to any company that sells the additive * if * they ca n't find a justifiable scientific reason to ban it . 
  both their environmental and health departments found no reason to ban it . 
  if they did , they would be able to do so with no penalty . 
  you reply multiple times to a single post , you edit your posts after people have replied to them , you tell people to read books to understand one of your points instead of explaining it yourself , you bring up obscure references without indicating how they link to your point . 
  you 're most probably mentally ill and you 're just not worth my time . 
  you talk a lot , but you do n't say much . 
  think about it . 
  the ethyl case ? 
  why ? 
  not everything is actionable under isds . 
   governments are known to do that . 
  political purposes like `` these guys are big contributors to our party and need our help '' . 
  yes , they should have lost because the canadian government only did it for political purposes . 
  the case did n't forbid them from banning the additive , it just meant that canada would have to give fair compensation to any companies that were using the additive for fuel . 
  they had the option of giving the company 250 million dollars and keeping the ban , or giving them 20 million dollars ( because the canadian government spokespeople were saying bad things about the company and that hurt it 's ` goodwill ' ) and repealing the ban . 
  they chose the latter . 
  considerably more so than a layperson who edits their posts after they 've been replied to to completely change the content of them . 
  look mate , i trust the canadian and australian health departments ( bodies of experts whose job it is to determine the danger from such chemicals ) considerably more than i trust your selective reading of the facts . 
  eh , like i said , a small beer with lunch is fine . 
  any more and you 're getting into bad territory . 
  you really think there 's some kind of ` sjw ' conspiracy against you ? 
  you do n't even read through any of the shit on there . 
  you just link to it and try and pass it off as proof that it 's bad . 
  you understand there are horribly toxic chemicals even in consumer grade chocolate , but it 's at such levels that it 's not harmful ? 
  the reason we rely on health department reports and the like is because they determine how much exposure of a substance the weakest people can tolerate before it becomes dangerous . 
  half the shit you eat is deadly in the right concentrations . 
  you understand there 's a world of difference between manganese and mcmt ? 
  and that that 's why both the canadian health department and the canadian environmental department cleared its usage and said there was no danger from it ? 
  why the additive has also been added to fuels in australia in 2000 ? 
  i hate to link it , but check out the [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/methylcyclopentadienyl_manganese_tricarbonyl ) to show that it 's not considered bad . 
  can you , for once , explain what you want to say and not just link to something ? 
  and you realise that the canadian health department cleared it after extensive tests and said that even those that were working in close proximity with the additives , elderly , sick , and children , faced no danger from having the substance in petrol ? 
  yes , in some circumstances it 's toxic . 
  but not under the kind it was being used for . 
  sure , if it 's found to be mixed competence then that 's certainly the case . 
  because doctors are experts on matters of international trade and negotiation . 
  eu law takes precedence over national law . 
  i wrote a post about it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ewgn3/lets_have_a_discussion_about_the_ttip/ ) a few weeks ago . 
  tenets , not tenants , 
  everyone who disagrees is a shill . 
  i 'm not american , and do you have anything relevant to say or are you just running around whining again ? 
  you seem to have turned me into some [ bogeyman ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2h0oi3/ttip_and_tisa_big_pressure_to_trade_away_privacy/ckob2t9 ) and [ bitching about me in other subs ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2hal5o/eli5_its_been_nearly_2_decades_since_nafta_has/ckr6k98 ) . 
  grow up . 
   imagine for example that a new administration gets elected and they want to tighten some environmental protections - with this investment protection clause they would get sued ( in a private court without public oversight ) and would have to pay compensation to the companies who are effected . 
  that 's not the case at all . 
  they can only get sued if there is no reasonable grounds for putting the new environmental standards in place . 
  take the ethyl corp vs canada case . 
  both the canadian health department and the canadian environmental department found that there were no grounds to ban the use of an additive to petrol . 
  if there had been , they would have been fine , but their reports explicitly stated that there was no danger from the additive . 
  the government still put in a piece of legislation which banned the additive , and so the case went to arbitration through nafta . 
  the canadian government lost specifically because they claimed it was for health reasons , where their own health department reports explicitly stated otherwise . 
  if their own national department reports had said that there was a danger , it would have been fine . 
  that 's still uncertain at this stage . 
  the ecj is currently mulling over whether it 's a mixed competence ( like the ttip ) or whether the ec can impose it unilaterally on the states . 
  as i said , it 's been referred to the ecj . 
  but it 's not up to the austrian parliament to decide that , countries just ca n't all of a sudden say ` nope , it 's mixed competence so you ca n't do that ' . 
  we 'll see what the ecj says , and if they agree that it 's mixed competence then it 'll hold weight . 
  if not , then their parliamentary motion was meaningless . 
  they are bound to a legal code - the contract signed between the states , ie : the treaty . 
  i do n't see what they can do about it , it 's unknown whether it 's a mixed-competence agreement , or whether the eu has full jurisdiction . 
  until that 's known ( it 's been referred to the ecj already ) , the motion is meaningless . 
  you 're a very black and white person . 
  they do exist under the energy charter treaty , amongst others . 
  should germany revoke it 's ban on nazi symbols ? 
  it 's uncertain yet whether ceta is a mixed competence deal or not . 
  if it is , then any country could also prevent it going through . 
  out of curiosity , what persuaded you to reply in a ten day old submission ? 
   then please explain to me why karel de gucht openly says in an interview that `` the americans are insisting on isds , so it has to be in '' . 
  note he does n't say anything like ` against our wishes ' . 
  the eu wants it in as well , but they know the ttip is a bigger issue here than in the us so they make it seem like it 's the us ' fault . 
  how does it do that ? 
  it 's illegal in countries to display nazi symbols , it 's illegal in countries to display soviet symbols . 
  how are they non-democratic ?
