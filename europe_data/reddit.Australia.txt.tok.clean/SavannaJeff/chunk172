  engagement in the community ? 
  muslims even between syria , saudi arabia , albania , and pakistan are completely different . 
  the person is generalizing all muslims , and all middle easterners , despite there being wide variations between them . 
  i think i 'm next . 
  if i wanted to visit stormfront , i 'd visit fucking stormfront . 
  because one muslim is exactly like another muslim , right ? 
  it 's not like an indonesian , malaysian , pakistani , sudanese , syrian , chechen , and albanian muslim tend to be different . 
  they 're exactly the same because they 're muslim !, 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i have n't acted ignorant , most other people have . 
  i 'm not trolling , you 're just an idiot . 
  how are borders closing no affecting syrian refugees ? 
  how is a reluctance to deal with the refugee crisis not affecting syrians ? 
  * in relation to syrians * . 
  my god . 
  it 's not trying to address the worries of the general population , it 's trying to explain syrians in relation to the refugee crisis . 
  this video is n't about the rest , it 's not trying to reflect the full picture of the refugee crisis , it 's specifically about syrian refugees . 
  it 's not trying to show the whole picture of the refugee crisis , it 's only trying to show the picture * in relation to syrians * . 
  when they say it will increase by 1 % , they only mean if the eu takes in * all syrian refugees * . 
  the eu has n't even taken in a tenth of them . 
  holy shit , you 're still trying to generalize this to the refugee crisis in general . 
  it 's * not fucking about that * . 
  if you think you can generalize such a small sample size to a population of over a billion , you 're an idiot . 
  no , they 're * only discussing the european refugee crisis with respect to syrians * . 
  the clue is in the title . 
  it 's not `` the european refugee crisis , and we 're gon na talk a little bit about syrians as well '' . 
  it 's specifically about syrians with respect to the refugee crisis . 
  so you 're happy to generalize all muslims ? 
  wonderful person , you are . 
  this video is about * syrian refugees in relation to the refugee crisis in europe * . 
  how is this so difficult for you people ? 
  jesus christ , how many times do i have to explain this ? 
  they 're explaining the refugee crisis in the context of syrian refugees . 
  that 's in the fucking title . 
  it 's an article that shows that * all * immigrant groups are as claimed in the video , not just latin american ones . 
  and who gives a shit if they do n't cite ` muslim ' and ` middle eastern ' immigrants at all ? 
  so you think they 're explaining the european refugee crisis , and then also explaining general facts about syria , it 's history , it 's culture , etc ? 
  the two clauses are related . 
  if english is the only language you speak , you 're clearly not speaking it past a tenth grade level . 
  obviously it 's talking about ** the european refugee crisis [ with respect to syria ] syria explained ** . 
  i can only assume you 're not a native speaker , or you 'd know this . 
  i do n't trust people with direct democracy , which referenda basically are . 
  referenda should be used almost exclusively for constitutional change , not for hot-button political issues that have rather explicit methodology behind one side . 
  it does n't take them long , they pretty much own the place now . 
  welcome to / r/europe 2015 . 
  this place has always had a strong undercurrent of racism , but in the last months it 's gone to full blwon neo-nazi levels complete with dehumanizing people , suggesting we gun down boatloads of refugees , invade north africa to stem the tide , and laughing about dead kids . 
  whilst the video is talking about * syrian refugees * . 
  did you even look ? 
  it 's [ here ] ( http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-mythical-connection-between-immigrants-and-crime-1436916798 ) . 
  this is a fantastic video . 
  i would 've hoped that fifty years ago we would 've helped refugees fleeing the oppression of the warsaw pact as well . 
  it 's not what the eu demands , it 's what countries agreed to . 
  i 'm not used to upcoming you , but you 're being eminently reasonable here . 
  this is the same shit he says all the time , and even here he 's wrong . 
  they 're not being violated in the eu or australia . 
  follow the argument mate . 
  you mentioned that we should get rid of elections for that reason , i was explaining how it was an argument to get rid of referenda on a number of issues , and not elections . 
  mate , i know you 're not stupid . 
  there 's a huge difference between a single issue , or a swathe of issues . 
  read the other people that replied to me . 
  i misread any country as every country . 
  oh , i misread . 
  my bad . 
  pretty sure there 's nothing in the human rights convention about the native population having its human rights violated because some refugees went to their country . 
  no it 's not . 
  it 's an argument for not having referenda in a number of areas . 
  but that 's not accurate in the slightest, 
  yeah ? 
  how ? 
  how are those rights in the eu being violated ? 
  mate , i 'm not arguing against my own employment and do n't know why you 'd think i am . 
  convincing a few dozen people on reddit is n't gon na do shit in the long run . 
  in fairness to the previous system , i recall seeing a statistic where he majority were actually retired judges and/or professors of international law . 
  no mate , you live in lalaland and it has no resemblance to reality . 
  yes , but we 've had this discussion before and they 're not planning on getting rid of health regulations or anything . 
  rather , they 're looking at areas where regulations are different but functionally equivalent , and allowing for dual certification in those instances . 
  your presumption that they 're going to get rid of environmental and safety regulation like ` allowing toxic waste dumps ' is simply retarded . 
  anti-dumping is accepted as legitimate in trade agreements , it 's rather prominent in the wto and is n't really controversial . 
  as to infant industry , that 's such an edge case that there 's not much to be said . 
  it has worked in the past , but it should n't be an argument for protectionism because you can use the argument to justify * anything * . 
  that 's what has struck me so much as well , how dehumanizing the comments and arguments are . 
  no , that 's not the case . 
  legislative power is n't being exported , markets are n't being deregulated to match us laws , and you clearly have n't read the leaks or you 'd understand that it was harmonization of functionally equivalent regulations ( ie ; ones that have n't been demonstrated to be safer , but are different anyway ) . 
  ttip has no power to diminish publicly owned/funded operations . 
  it 's clear you have n't read more than one or two scare articles . 
  go educate yourself first . 
  because they 're refugees , duh . 
  have you read through the leaked documents ? 
  sure , here 's the [ submission of claim ] ( http://www.economia-snci.gob.mx/sic_php/pages/importa/sol_contro/consultoria/casos_canada/ethyl/971002_statement_of_claim.pdf ) documents for the ethyl case . 
  the tufts study is awful though , it does n't even take the main variable ( ntbs ) into account . 
  i too would prefer an international institution along the lines of the wtos dsm , but there 's been no political will to do something in that direction since french anti-globalists tanked the mai some two decades ago . 
  hopefully something will come out of the new proposal . 
  there 's plenty .

  that last one , each link on there has been clicked an average of 2300 times since they first put it up around the start of the year . 
  only 2300 times each !, 
  and yet 2 million people sign an anti-ttip petition ... 
  allow me to repost a comment i made a while back ; first , there is no provision in * any * of the 3400 + agreements ( which have existed since the 1950s , mind you , and have n't led to any of the apocalyptic shit people like to spout ) with isds provisions that allow a company to ` sue for lost profits ' .
