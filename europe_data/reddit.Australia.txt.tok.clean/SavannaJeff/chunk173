  they can sue with this in mind , * but they will lose * . 
  the only way an isds case can be succesful is if the company demonstrates that the government has breached one of the four fundamental protections of the investment protection chapter of the agreement ; fair compensation for expropriation , national treatment ( discriminating against foreign companies ) , freedom of movement of capital , or equitable access to the legal system ( not allowed to make arbitrary decision for things like applying for permits ) . 
  let me give you an example of an isds case - back in the mid 1990s , the canadian government decided to ban a fuel additive used by only one company , the american ethyl corporation , on the grounds of public health and environmental issues . 
  ethyl corp took the canadian government to isds proceedings , and the canadian government eventually settled - agreeing to pay some twenty million dollars and not enacting the law . 
  in all the papers , it was described as `` company sues canada over health regulations '' . 
  obviously , this raised a lot of public ire and to this day is still pointed at as why isds is bad . 
  but that 's because no one looked at the facts of the matter . 
  canada was implementing the ban * against the advice of both the canadian health and environmental departments * . 
  both said that there was no danger from the additives use in fuel , so why did the government implement it anyway ? 
  it turns out , that the party in power had been a long and traditional ` friend ' of canada 's own domestic industry . 
  there was no scientific or empirical evidence for the ban , it was purely a way to help out a party donor at the expense of foreigners . 
  now , you asked why do governments want isds provisions ? 
  well , lets look at ttip in particular for both sides . 
  european governments are scared of the way that the us has abused it 's powers in the past to discriminate against foreign investors , such as the ` buy american ' provisions that require that for certain state funded projects , only american goods and services can be used . 
  they 're also worried because [ the us has historically either implicitly , or explicitly , discriminated against european good and services in the past ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z ) . 
  for the us , it 's because some countries in the european union do n't actually have very strong judiciaries - witness how victor orban in hungary is running roughshod over them , or why poland has been sued so many times thanks to discriminating against foreign companies . 
  the only way to ensure strong protections for foreign investors is to actually have some form of an enforcement mechanism , and the only viable such mechanism is isds . 
  it 's basically an enforcement mechanism for treaties to protect investors against regulatory abuses by a government , as well as a way to de-escalate disputes from the state-state level ( where much more damage can be done to * both * sides ) to the investor-state level . 
  i mean , every time this topic has come up and the scaremongering comes out , i 've challenged people - point me to * one * successful isds case that was n't justified . 
  no one has yet been able to do so . 
  instead , they point to ongoing cases like the phillip morris case against australia , a case which pm will undoubtedly lose thanks to carve outs in bits that specify that , * of course * , a government can regulate in the interest of the public for matters such as health , or the environment . 
  just because a company can sue a government , does n't mean they will win - and even in domestic courts , people are free to sue for frivolous reasons or those against the public interest - and again , they will also almost certainly lose . 
  isds cases do n't cost much - oecd figures state that the average isds case costs eight million dollars , and even when a company wins they only win on average 2c for every dollar claimed - so when you see a report about `` company suing government for 1 billion dollars '' , they 'll generally only get 20 million . 
  we 've seen what happens in situations when such things are n't moderated . 
  there 's the class [ f7u12 drama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/2f7qog/classic_in_2012_f7u12_began_a_month_of_no/ ) , or more recently with [ league of legends ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/376uhn/and_so_it_begins_rleagueoflegends_goes_modless/ ) . 
  it does n't work . 
  labour organizations , environmental organizations , etc all do the same . 
  they 're also lobby groups . 
  all international negotiation is conducted in secret , it 's the only way to get things done . 
  but the final agreement will be public for over a year before it 's even voted on , so there 's plenty of time for public scrutiny then . 
  we do n't know . 
  it 's mostly speculation and fearmongering at this stage . 
  your definition of a ` good ' mod in that case must be someone that does nothing . 
  i much prefer mods that handle situations , than those that just sit back and wait for things to cool down . 
  i notice that you do n't tell off the ` right wing ' side about their nastiness like you 're doing here , which i would hazard is considerably more toxic than the ` left ' sides . 
  the end result is meat , who cares how we get there ? 
  you did n't slaughter the requisite number of lambs to complete the ritual . 
  why do n't you read the cepr report then ? 
  i dunno mate , i imagine in twenty years when little has changed for the worse as a result of ttip and there 's a new scary agreement around the corner , the same people will pick up and start polishing their pitchforks . 
  i said this would happen . 
  i told you all that the mega thread was the lesser evil . 
  no one listened , this place has turned into / r/european . 
  without something which will only be mass criticized as ` censorship ' by the mods , we 're not getting things back to how they were . 
  there 's so much wrong with your post i do n't even know where to start . 
  why do n't you try looking at my sub / r/tradeissues , specifically the posts dealing with secrecy in negotiations and isds . 
  you might learn something . 
  it 's far more complex than that . 
  your interpretation is so reductive as to be useless . 
  or they realize that ttip is n't going to eat their babies . 
  it 's not ` directly undermining laws ' , do n't be hyperbolic . 
  whut ? 
  i live in europe , and we 've agreed to take 30k as i recall . 
  i do n't believe in jokes , they 're haram . 
  you do n't do anything except shitpost , do you ? 
  this has nothing to do with aspiring refugees , and i do n't know why you 're calling me gandhi . 
  do you just get ` triggered ' when you see the word refugee , or what ? 
  you do n't put those africa children in that position . 
  however deporting someone to a country you know there 's a high probability they 'll be killed or tortured is putting them in that position . 
  you 'd be effectively giving them the death/torture penalty . 
  that should be abhorrent to any civilized state . 
  way to miss the point . 
  no , but they 'll likely be drowned out by the people with uninformed opinions . 
  it 's the whole `` i 'm entitled to my opinion '' phenomenon . 
  of course you are , but no one has to listen to it and it might be worth nothing . 
  intelligent people learn to discern between sources , and know when their own knowledge is lacking - and hence defer to better sources . 
  people well versed and specialized in an area are infinitely preferable to an uneducated rabble . 
  if i wanted to have a proper discussion about a subject , i 'd want to make the signal to noise ratio as good as possible . 
  `` we should have a discussion about mental health . 
  we should bring in mental health specialists , psychiatrists , psychologists , social workers in related fields , etc '' `` no , that 's an incredibly elitist view and not very democratic ! '', 
  and rightly they should . 
  as long as they 're not refugee , as that would violate the principle of non-refoulment , and they should be locked up instead . 
  that 's not true in the slightest , i was born and raised in australia . 
  i 'm an aussie guy that studied in poland . 
  no worries !, 
  why would they do that ? 
  i remember when this subreddit was good , where people actually discussed things . 
  i feel like if i do n't fight back , i 'm giving up on that . 
  i still have hope . 
  if the mod team picks up the slack again , things can be better . 
  but it takes the community to actually argue against the racists as well . 
  [ easy peasy wiki link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lump_of_labour_fallacy ) . 
  the whole `` automation means fewer jobs thing '' has been disproven countless times using the lump of labour fallacy . 
  i suggest you educate yourself , instead of spouting bullshit talking points you half remember . 
  it 's as if you think those countries wo n't be developing at the same time that their population is expanding . 
  there was a huge explosion in the industrial age in cities where they were flooded with the uneducated rural folk . 
  i think the west turned out pretty ok after that . 
  the trick is in making the institutions work . 
  i do n't think you realise how big africa actually is . 
  it 's three times bigger than europe . 
  they can fit a lot of people . 
  i can see being against this booklet , but how are they parasites ? 
  indonesia would beg to differ . 
  fits the xenophobic narrative . 
  it 's not possible that things are more complex than they appear . 
  if only that was the reality . 
  yes , and very very very few of them are refugees . 
  those 400,000 are under different arrangements with the ukrainian government , many of which have been standing for a long time . 
  i 'm not full of crap . 
  pretty well , yeah . 
  that 's not what this discussion has been about .
