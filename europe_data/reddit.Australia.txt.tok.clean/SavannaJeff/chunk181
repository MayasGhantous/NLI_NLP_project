  they 're not ` illegals ' , they 're people requesting asylum . 
  which is fair enough . 
  i do n't see why the public should have a right to see what a company is telling the government its concerned about , just as the government should n't publish letters of everyone that write to them saying ` i 'm concerned about this ' . 
  what 's the issue ? 
  now you 're bordering on paranoia . 
  i have n't seen any reliable data to imply that there is welfare shopping , much as there was none when it came to eu migration . 
  that 's simply not how it works , and you have no clue what you 're talking about . 
  i did n't say it was just a reddit thing , i specifically said controversial articles . 
  any of those would qualify , and is typical of what gets exposure on reddit when it comes to feminism . 
  yes ? 
  if your only experience with feminism was n't highly controversial articles published to reddit , then this would be obvious to you . 
  this was my interpretation also . 
  interesting !, 
  i was worried with the seeming inexorable rise of the peoples party that danes were getting more xenophobic in general , but this seems to indicate otherwise . 
  what ? 
  i would love for you to provide some studies that show an empiric causation between poverty and war . 
  you understand that poverty is n't anywhere near enough to be classified a refugee ? 
  should is not a hard ` must ', 
  it 's the only way a refugee convention could work ? 
  what , they apply at the british embassy of the repressive regime that 's there , and the internal security ` disappear ' the asylum claimant ? 
  no one is saying they have free run of the country . 
  they should be detained and monitored until their asylum process is complete ( and deported if they 're deemed not to be a refuge ) . 
  i just want to say respect mate , you put this beautifully . 
  not even close to what i said . 
  australia is extremely open to immigration and refugees - the only thing we 've been clamping down on is irregular arrivals . 
  some 25 % of australia citizens were not born in australia , and a walk in the middle of melbourne , sydney , brisbane ... any big city , will show a wide diversity of ethnicity - my school , for example , s only about 20 % white . 
  you 're entire argument , like those of the bigots , is treating all these people as the same - despite that many of them want to integrate , want to become ` good germans ' or ` good aussies ' or what have you . 
  and if they dislike other cultures , slut shame , etc , then yes - they 're bigots . 
  i 'd have to disagree . 
  it 's implying that people ca n't adapt to new cultures , and has a view that fundamentally treats all people in one country as the same . 
  i mean , i probably have more in common when it comes to value systems with thousands of syrians than i do with thousands of racist aussies . 
  yep . 
  if i hear another ` but first safe country , so not refugees ! ', 
  style comment i might scream . 
  it 's more than that . 
  whilst i 'm very critical of people that oppose the refugee convention , i only refer to as bigots those people that say things like ` because their culture is different they should n't come here ', 
  no , i 've always supported deporting those deemed not to be refugees . 
  but you seemed to be implying we should n't be helping boats in distress . 
   ** human ** itarian  to his countryman first, 
  i 've got ta ask , what is this racist obsession with cuckolding ? 
  right , then let 's check their documents while the ship is sinking , those that are fleeing war get carried aboard , those that do n't are left to drown !, 
  real humanitarian , you are . 
  no complaints about isds or secret negotiations here , i see . 
  they 're moderators . 
  they have free reign to do as they like . 
  this is n't a democracy or owned by the community . 
  it 's the mods job to balance the interests of the people in the community ( fair rules ) and the interests of the community itself ( preventing a race to the bottom ) . 
  for some reason , you people seem to think this is like a courtroom where strict laws apply . 
  it 's not . 
  but i 'm fine with it , it 's better than mob rule and i 'm confident the moderators are trying to moderate with the community as a whole 's interest at heart . 
  yes , i did apply online . 
  they said i can pick up my card in a few days . 
  then do you have a solution that does n't involve scrapping the refugee convention ? 
  i recognize that this is a problem , i just see little that can realistically be done at this stage . 
  yes . 
  the system is n't perfect , but i do n't see what argument you 're trying to make . 
  they get processed though . 
  if they 're not refugees , they get sent back . 
  refugees , not everybody . 
  no , i applied online . 
  obviously the system is n't perfect . 
  but when has any government policy actually been . 
  40 % is far from ideal , but i 'm sure they 're tweaking it and working to get the rate higher - especially since the scale of the refugee crisis has meant that most processing centres are completely swamped , and far over capacity . 
  they have a bunch of ways to figure out where they 're from - dialect and language specialists , dna testing , detaining until they 're told , mapping their journey , etc. 
  it 's bizarre to me that people think the interaction goes like this : ** immigration officer ** : we 've deemed you 're not a refugee , so now you have to tell us where you 're from so we can deport you !, 
  ** asylum seeker ** : no . 
  ** immigration officer ** : ok , you can stay then . 
  i did n't ` lie ' . 
  the question was what is the difference between this and open borders . 
  there are obvious differences , like the one i mentioned , and people * do * get deported . 
  if they 're libyan , they 're probably genuine refugees . 
  if they 're not libyan , why would they send them back to libya ? 
  they 're not libyans after all , and not their responsibility . 
  you get deported if you 're not deemed to be a refugee . 
  ca n't on alienblue for the ios . 
  so you also believe in a massive corruption conspiracy ? 
  how are they breaking the law ? 
  when someone wants to get rid of the refugee convention for muslims , when someone wants to gun down boatloads of immigrants , when someone says the holocaust is n't real - yeah , i call em racist . 
  if someone intelligently criticisms current immigration policy ( as opposed to ` dae multiculturalism ? 
  lol ' ) then i 'll happily have a civil discussion with them . 
  the reason i call people racist here so often is because , surprise surprise , there are a lot of them here . 
  i 'm usually on my phone or tablet , where there is no report button . 
  white guilt and holocaust denial suddenly appear !, 
  you 've uncovered ; a racist !, 
  fero is one of the most notorious racists on this sub . 
  that 's not true in the slightest . 
  i 've seen a bunch of people try and justify gunning down boatloads of refugees . 
  open a euro denominated bank account . 
  that 's what i did with it , ars technica writer . 
  swinging coon ? 
  completely unsurprising you 'd make such a comment . 
  that was my first thought also . 
  it 's not a theory . 
  it 's literally the purpose of the refugee convention . 
  the point of accepting refugees is n't to get some kind of uneducated workforce , it 's to give people experiencing conflicts and oppression a safe haven . 
  everything i 've seen that user write has convinced me they 're just an edgy teen . 
  half the people on this subreddit , reading the comments on immigration, 
  this place is racist central since they got rid of the megathread . 
  again , you presume massive and widespread corruption amongst the elite of 28 countries plus the ep . 
  i put it to you that this is not the case , and that you 're mistrtust borders on paranoia .
