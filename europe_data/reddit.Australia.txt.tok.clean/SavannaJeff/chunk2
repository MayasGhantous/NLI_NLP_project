  you ca n't even answer a simple question ? 
  let 's start with some questions . 
  have you finished at least a graduate degree , and if so did you attend a methodology course ? 
  you 're still not providing evidence for any of your claims , you 're just saying ` look , here 's a guy that disagrees with the same thing as me ! ' . 
  if you do n't understand the difference , and persist in replying in such a manner , i may just have to put you on ignore . 
  are you drunk ? 
  i have european citizenship , and i 've lived in europe for over 5 years ( including countries which have a lot of roma ) . 
  you just do n't know dick and are probably by-and-large a racist . 
  is a clever repartee really enough to determine that ? 
  i actually quite liked bildt , i 'm going to need considerably more to agree with you . 
  the state is willing to enforce it . 
  it 's just the burden of proof against many roma ` thieves ' is not sufficient to warrant their arrest in most cases . 
  do you have any evidence of widespread instances of police ignoring crimes committed by roma , or are you just talking out of your arse ? 
  [ here are dg trade 's reasonings ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/october/tradoc_151790.pdf ) . 
  but beyond that , i think it would be difficult to design any kind of statistical analysis that definitively proves national courts are biased against investors , but there are plenty of single cases that seem to indicate that is the case . 
  with the rest , could you please rephrase it ? 
  you 're not being terrible clear . 
   nothing wrong with doing that . 
  i think i outlined why it can not apply to the eu level . 
  really ? 
  the example i gave you was one where a government acted completely lawfully ( though not in accordance with nafta ) to intentionally discriminate against a foreign company . 
  there is no legal protection ( one that european courts could give ) that foreign companies could have against that in any european court systems . 
  it could potentially give companies recourse in matters such as the one i write about [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z ) , which is clearly just protectionist-driven responses in internationally competitive procurement . 
  jeez , the constant ideologically driven downvotes on subjects like these are tiring as well . 
  you asked me to define the discrimination , i felt the easiest way to do that was through an example to show you how this discrimination happens . 
  the whole point of isds is that there are intrinsic biases within the domestic government and court system against foreign investors , and hence why they need additional protection . 
  the best example is probably the ethyl case which i wrote about [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2kq8in/why_support_the_tpp_when_it_will_let_foreign/clnu2rl ) . 
  government creates law claiming environmental/health protection , gets sued and forced to settle , paying the company around 20 million dollars , plus repealing the law . 
  edit : by the way , that article you linked to is massively misrepresenting in at least the vattenfall-hamburg case . 
  2nd edit : and it does n't even know the phillip morris case is n't about displaying health labels , but about plain packaging . 
  jesus , what a terrible source you linked to . 
  the title of the article should be `` guy writes sensationalist column on subject he knows nothing about because he 's a hack '' , although i guess that might be a little long . 
  568 cases over 3000 agreements dating back 50 years is rare , so i do n't see why you 'd claim it 's not . 
  it 's pretty damn well known that such cumulative graphs are purposefully misleading as well , by the way . 
   it seems noteworthy that one main aspect of the isds opposition is left out in the doc . 
  namely the one of the indirect prevention of consumer rights/environmental protection/whatever improvements since a country having to fear a lawsuit run at a supranational instance with compensation payments to follow might not introduce those improvements ( for its citizens ) in the first place . 
  well , no , because as i 've demonstrated in the past , provided that the government laws are n't discriminatory against foreign companies , they 're not going to get lose isds cases , especially given the clause that was added to the negotiation mandate about legitimate public policy objectives . 
   since isds tries to establish a protective layer above any national or currently available eu level which also is n't available to the ordinary citizen , the `` usefulness '' ( as the doc uses the term , leaving the citizen 's viewpoint completely out of the game ) is there but only for the party aiming for mentioned profits . 
  the advantage that the signatory to the isds clauses gets is increased investment , because investors thus have a remediatory mechanism if they are discriminated against . 
  curious that you 'd neglect to mention this ( portraying the inclusion of isds provisions as one-sided ) when earlier you were talking about checking for biases . 
  interesting submission , and not only because it largely aligns with my view . 
  alternatively , it 's because i 've studied the topic extensively , and i 've argued about it on reddit before such as [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1c736z/in_unusual_move_german_chancellor_has_invited_uk/c9drnm6 ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/145bi4/norway_to_raise_import_tolls_on_dairy_and_meat/c7a6bkj ) . 
  as a consequence , i can recognize typically unnuanced , ignorant , and shallow british criticisms of the cap almost immediately . 
  there were no merits , they were just unsubstantiated talking points . 
  companies are inherently amoral , so good luck with that . 
  you think it 's ok for the farmers to spray round up on their crops to try and kill the non-gm ones so that ` roundup ready ' gm crops grow instead ? 
  because it 's generally only in instances like this that the company sues . 
  again , there 's no problem if some seeds from the neighbours crop come over to yours and start growing gm plants . 
  the issue is if you try and promote those so you do n't have to pay for the more expensive seeds that a company has spent billions of dollars developing . 
  i do n't give a shit about monsanto , you 're free to criticize it . 
  i specifically referred to gm crops in that post because ** that 's what the context of the discussion was on ** . 
  the focus was on the gm fears , not monsanto , so obviously you do n't understand the context ` perfectly well ' . 
  actually , producers are paid to under-produce to prevent the butter mountains and wine lakes of the past . 
  mate , the topic was about gm fears and monsanto , and you decided to charge on in and say i 'm ` white knighting ' for monsanto when really i was laughing at the ridiculous claims anti-gm people make about the company . 
  if you do n't understand context in a discussion , perhaps you should n't participate . 
  china has strong institutional systems that can enforce a one-child policy . 
  unfortunately , many african states simply do not . 
  ah , someone whose knowledge of the cap does n't extend beyond the telegraph opinion section . 
  it 's more complex than that , as i recall . 
  they only typicall sued when farmers were actively trying to promote the growth of gm crops pollinating their fields , such as by spraying round up ( a herbicide ) on their crops , thereby not having to pay for the patented seeds . 
  having a portion of your farm pollinated by gm seeds without paying for them is fine , and you 're free to go on and sell the produce . 
  the issue is when you actively try and ` steal ' the companies developed crops . 
   anniston alabama oh wow , there was a chemical problem around a chemical factory !, 
  obviously , every aspect of monsanto 's operations that people bitch about is true as well !, 
  gm crops made by monsanto are just a way for the company to control world governments !, 
  terminator crops mean people will be dependent on monsanto forever !, 
  learn some nuance , eh ? 
  first , i 'm not a ` ttip cheerleader ' . 
  i just disagree with the baseless negative view most people have on it here . 
  second , my position on monsanto is pretty different to what it was a year ago - because i educated myself , and learned to read in depth beyond shallow , simplistic , conspiratorial and fearmongering stories . 
  eh , even with that the laws are pretty reasonable . 
  only where it 's clear a farmer has taken the patented seeds specifically ( as opposed to stuff blowing onto their fields ) can they get in trouble . 
  but what about all the bullshit myths about how evil monsanto is , and that 's why we should n't allow gm ? 
  because they want gas and russia has it . 
  also , there 's the absolutely magical [ kuukene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bap6jugfgka ) by trad.attack !, 
  love these guys to death . 
  it 's like israel has been so used to the west toeing their official line that they do n't even know how to make appropriate responses any more . 
  i too recognize your name !, 
  but the +37 next to it makes it easier !, 
  because i 've seen your poor argumentation in the past , and until i see sources with quotes i do n't feel like wasting my time . 
  i promise you , if you make a post with quotes to back up your arguments ( and page references ) , i will read it and give it my full consideration , you might even shift my opinion . 
  but in the past your posts have been full of such conspiracy theory laden bullshit that i do n't see any point giving your writing any credence . 
  well , yeah ... 
  again , when you make an argument , you have to link to a source and provide a page reference , like i do . 
  i 'm not going to read through long pdfs of shit when i do n't trust you as it is . 
  it 's a joke mate , it does n't mean anything in particular . 
  do n't read too much into it . 
  i 've considered your arguments , you asking people to consider them and then say ` for support , read 500 pages of pdf documents ' . 
  when i make an argument , i link to the exact fucking page . 
  i 'm abrasive because you 're a conspiracy theorist who thinks he 's intelligent and sees more than the ` sheeple ' but does n't . 
  when you can back up your arguments with actual references , unbiased sources , pages numbers , and quotes , then i 'll treat your arguments with some respect . 
  until then , get mental help . 
  yes , is joke . 
  in the us , they use mexicans for agricultural production . 
  in europe , anyone east of the country of production . 
  in australia , we use europeans on work-life visas . 
  first they came for the kebabs , and i was not a kebab eater so i did n't speak up ... 
  i do n't see the problem . 
  in australia , we use people from poor countries like the uk , sweden , and france as farm labour too . 
  but someone said it was because the european commission wants to stop ep members looking at not anti-ttip sentiments on my order !,
