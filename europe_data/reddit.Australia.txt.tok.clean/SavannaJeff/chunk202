  i did a short eli5 [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32bdez/my_grandad_reads_the_paper_everyday_and_hasnt/cq9w6y2 ) about that . 
   good thing the eu parliament was already going to vote on it before it was being published . 
  this is a complete lie . 
   the issue with public services is the investor-state dispute settlement ( isds ) , the provision that would allow private investors to sue governments for the loss of future profits caused by decisions made by national parliaments . 
  this is bullshit , there is no provision in any agreement ever that allows a company to sue a government because they experienced ` lost profits ' . 
  i wrote about it [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/36j4rj/ive_read_obamas_secret_trade_deal_elizabeth/creo7lp ) and [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2srn0u/trade_secrets_why_will_no_one_answer_the_obvious/cnsffwo ) if you want to know the real story behind isds , and not sensationalist articles . 
  as to the rest , they 're fundamentally misunderstanding ( or misrepresenting ) the kind of ntbs that are going to be removed . 
  the eu is n't going for harmonization of standards , it 's about dual certification . 
  what they 're doing is going over regulations ( for example how much grip a tire has to have ) , and if the regulations are essentially the same they 're saying `` ok , we 'll accept your certification in this area if you 'll accept ours , since our standards are equivalent '' . 
  it 's not some race to the bottom , the eu has repeatedly stated they 're not going to lower standards for the sake of an agreement . 
  they 're just looking at standards that are functionally equivalent ( that is , different , but one is n't empirically better than the other ) and accepting eachother certification * in those areas * . 
  i was actually trying to be humorous , forgive me if i sounded condescending . 
  allow me to direct you to [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/399zg7/ttip_vote_postponed_blow_to_g7_hopes_of_an_early/cs20r1g ) that i just wrote answering this question to someone else . 
   i certainly do not want to have big american ( or european , i do n't care ) corporations dictating the commercial laws neither of my country nor of the union as a whole . 
  this is n't going to happen . 
  if you think it 's going to happen , point me to a credible source suggesting this . 
  but so far , the eu has repeatedly stated this is not going to happen , and i have more reason to believe them than anyone else short of a disgruntled eu negotiator . 
  your comments fly completely in the face of economics , and concepts such as comparative advantage . 
  if you want to go back to the good old days of the 50s , where each country had their own shitty car manufacturer , their own shitty washing machine manufacturer , and where consumer goods in general were more expensive and worse , then that 's what your stance 's conclusion is . 
  we 've found that liberalizing trade ( and hence removing protectionism ) is a net good for society . 
  the gigantic increases in global wealth and due to it . 
  it 's basically the only thing economics has a hard consensus on , and opposing it is * literally * equivalent to being a climate change denier . 
  there 's a comparable consensus amongst economists on this issue , as there is climate scientists on anthropogenic climate change . 
  because protectionism , and forgive me for using complex economic terms , is * bad * . 
  they will . 
  the agreement will be public for more than a year before they vote on it . 
  because sometimes those laws are n't to protect customers , but rather national industries . 
  there 's plenty of input during the negotiations . 
  there are constantly public consultations . 
  dg trade set up a website to send them your questions , concerns , and hopes . 
  and as i said , negotiators have to negotiate with what 's politically possible to implement in mind . 
   but what we do know is that it will be a large scale deregulation of many areas that stop the eu and the us trading . 
  link ? 
  to an authoritative source , not some blog . 
   uk trade minister lord livingston has stated that talks about the nhs were on the table , so it will effect all sorts of public services . 
  [ bollocks ] ( http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/health/health-committee-ttip-correspondence.pdf ) . 
  maybe they should wait until the final document is put in front of them and check it then , instead of being opposed to it blindly now ? 
  there is no gamble . 
  it 'll be publicly available for more than a year before it 's voted on . 
  trust the eu while it 's negotiating , and verify when it 's made public . 
   my experience tells me that the eu commission is not exactly representing my position . 
  in the current net neutrality debate they have a pro-business instead of a pro-consumer stance . 
  which makes me very skeptic whether they will in the ttip negotiations . 
  remember that the ep will be voting on this as well , meaning that negotiators have to vote with what 's politically possible to pass in mind . 
  acta was shot down by the ep due to public outrage , negotiators know this and hence will try and make sure it will not have anything bad in it so that it will pass . 
  right , but absent any other information it 's silly to disbelieve the eu on the subject . 
  plus that 's rather explicitly part of the negotiating mandate , if i recall correctly , meaning negotiators * ca n't * compromise on standards . 
  it 's truly mindboggling how many misconceptions people have about the agreement . 
  fuck wikileaks for writing that whole `` secret for four years '' bullshit . 
  fuck warren for all her `` secret negotiations '' bullshit . 
  they create arguments that egregiously mislead the public about the nature of the negotiations , essentially trying to manipulate them against the damn thing . 
  if the government were doing it in such a way , instead of political ` outsiders ' railing against the establishment , they 'd be out on their arse . 
  well it 's wrong , because laws enacted before ttip would not be actionable under the isds provisions . 
  that 's what happens when you have journalists commenting on matters they have no academic or real world backing on . 
  standards are n't going to be lowered . 
  tastes amazing , but extremely calorific . 
  how is it trying to do that ? 
  you keep saying such things , but they fly completely in the face of what dg trade has already said . 
  dg trade has already ruled out hormone beef , has said they 're not changing regulations on gmos , pesticides are covered under the fact that they said they were n't going to compromise on health and environmental standards . 
  seriously , what 's your backing for any of your arguments ? 
   what bowgentle wrote about it is that it has n't been settled yet . 
  the fact remains that a corporation has taken a country to arbitration over changing its minimum wage . 
  the outcome does n't even matter as much as the fact it has even proceeded . 
  you do know how contracts work , right ? 
  you do n't get to invalidate a contract just because you feel like it . 
   it seems to me what was voted on today was almost the eu equivalent of the fast track [ 1 ] legislation in the us it was nothing like fast track , and there 's nothing wrong with fast track . 
   which would give negotiators the power to continue plans to include isds in this final text with no further consolation with parliament . 
  negotiators already have the power to include isds in ttip , in fact it 's part of their mandate . 
  but that said , they have to negotiate according to two criteria ; what 's politically possible to pass , and what 's in their negotiating mandate . 
  acta was shot down due to the ep , so negotiators have to also be wary about what might be a reason to shoot down ttip as well . 
  if isds proves such a controversial issue , they may seek a new mandate . 
  but the fears over isds are blown completely out of proportion , and public understanding of isds is completely out of sync with reality . 
   by the way , this is n't meant to be a circlejerk `` monsanto will eat our babies sub '' but a place to talk and more importantly discuss how we can create effective resistance and have our voices heard since ordinary people do n't seem to be represented in the negotiation at all you are represented in the negotiations for the fact that there are constant public consultations ( negotiations over isds were shelved due to one such consultation ) , dg trade is * begging * for public submissions , ngos frequently consult with dg trade , and negotiators have to negotiate with what will be acceptable to the public ( and hence the ep ) . 
  there 's good reason to trust the eu on this matter . 
  the eu craves the legitimacy of the people . 
  national parliaments have the unquestioning legitimacy of the overwhelming majority of that nations people , but for the eu this is something that has to be carefully husbanded , conserved , and earned . 
  the member state governments have overwhelming control of the eu thanks to the council of ministers and the european council , and whilst politicians will always be politicians , the fact that the eu needs this to be popular amongst the public is why i think they wo n't sell us down the river . 
  of course , the final agreement will be public for more than a year after it 's made which will be plenty of time for scrutiny , and the european parliament shot down acta thanks to public pressure ( something the eu negotiating team is very mindful of ) , so there 's still hope even if it does turn out to be rotten . 
  but that the ep shot down acta is merely another indicator that there 's no reason to distrust the eu - because the negotiating team is already wary of what will be acceptable to the ep , to national parliaments , and to the people in general - and they will negotiate with what 's politically possible to pass in mind . 
  if i 'm rambling , forgive me , i 'm completely exhausted but do n't want to go to bed too early . 
  i 've got ta be honest , i ca n't be arsed responding to your post . 
  i could , and if you go back far enough in my post history i 've covered basically everything you 've said . 
  but right now i 'm exhausted , i 've been travelling , and i simply can not be bothered . 
  with that said , i hope you have a pleasant afternoon - maybe we can pick this up again in another thread in the future . 
  the only thing i 'm ever defending in such threads is the whole mechanism of isds , because i 'm intimately acquainted with it and know that public perception on it is completely off base . 
   the decisions of a democracy such as minimum wage simply should ' t be subject to corporate appeals . 
  it 's not . 
  you 're referring to the veolia case . 
  allow me to direct you to what bowgentle wrote about it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/390p5l/over_2000000_europeans_have_now_signed_the/cs0hyfx ) . 
   i 'm glad the tide seems to be turning against ttip now and hopefully the linked treaties such as tisa that will eviscerate our data privacy . 
  you do n't know that this is the case . 
  and until the documents are public , you wo n't , so i do n't know how you can claim to know that authoritatively until the final agreement is presented to the public . 
  i ca n't do anything about the judge , he 's not in my country . 
  i can do something about the horrendous comments in this article though . 
  how am i worried about one kind of racism ? 
  your argument is completely irrelevant to what i said . 
  racism is racism . 
  they will . 
  four years later , because it 's silly for the public ( ngos , labour organizations , etc ) to get angry at politicians for something they had no hand in formulating beyond giving negotiators the mandate . 
  it 's the civil service negotiating this , remember , not politicians .
