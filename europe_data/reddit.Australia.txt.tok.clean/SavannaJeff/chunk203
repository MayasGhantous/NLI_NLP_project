  you seem to also want to give away our negotiating strategies too ... 
  it 's the civil service that 's negotiating this , not elected officials . 
  regardless , negotiation is basically a game - you might promise something only to withdraw it later , you might propose something conditionally to open up negotiations in another area without intending to compromise on the original position . 
  anyway , most of reddit thinks parts of the agreement will remain secret for four years after implementation . 
  the negotiating texts , yes . 
  but the entirety of the agreement would be public before its voted on . 
  got anything substantive to add ? 
  dont think i 've seen you make a single meaningful comment your entire time on reddit . 
  there is no four year secrecy , it 's bullshit spread by anti-globalist , and anti-trade groups . 
  that 's burning children , get it right . 
  but in all seriousness , i 'm opposed to both corporal punishment and the tide of racism in this comment section . 
  yes , i can , because most of what you 've written is incorrect . 
  none of tisa will be secret , it 's only negotiating texts - basically what positions during the negotiations different parties have taken - that will be secret , not the final agreement itself as to isds that 's also no longer secret , there have been transparency initiatives over the past ten years that mean that both uncitral and icsid publish basically every document and allow for amicus briefs , etc. 
  the idea that isds is secret is from the past , it bares no relation on the present as to ttip , these are basically some of the most transparent trade negotiations ever conducted , and the eu has published a tremendous amount of information online - that no one bothers to read . 
  negotiate texts , idealized end state of various chapters , etc. 
  where do you consider there to be not enough transparency , especially compared to how regular laws are written ? 
  i also wrote a post that you can access via the subreddit i moderate , id link to it myself but i 'm on my phone , about why they 're negotiated in secret, 
  perhaps that country should n't sign a bilateral investment treaty containing isds then ? 
  i do n't think that 's the case . 
  the issue , as always , seems to have been shitty media reporting . 
  idealised chapters ( as viewed by the eu ) have been released but no one reads them . 
  myths about standards , the nhs have been disabused time and time again by the eu but no one hears about it . 
  they read one article by monbiot in the guardian , and they think they 're experts . 
  the information age should be better known as the disinformation age . 
  hello stormfronters , / r/european denizens , and assorted racists !, 
  i 'd like to welcome you to this unilaterally imposed cultural exchange to / r/europe . 
  i hope your stay is short . 
  pretty fertile anti-ttip circlejerk territory . 
  we should settle , raise crops and children , and tame this wild and bountiful land . 
  so without seeing the text of the treaty , you 've decided to try to stop ttip ? 
  yes , as you say the minimum wage increase would not have been a violation of the contract , that 's rather supporting evidence for their case that the contract was broken ( namely that they did n't get compensation for wage stability guarantees or some such ) . 
  i source my comments , i expect other people to do the same when they make claims such as `` ttip will lower our standards '' . 
  if they put no effort into their comments , i 'm often disinclined to put any into mine rebutting them . 
  so when i link to my comments like [ this ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2srn0u/trade_secrets_why_will_no_one_answer_the_obvious/cnsffwo ) or [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/tb/38asua ) to explain things , that 's not valuable content ? 
  it tried to be unbiased , but really was n't . 
  i 've been trying to explain these very points you 've made to people in this subreddit for months . 
  some will listen , some will never change . 
  if there 's one thing to guarantee pissing people off on both sides of a debate , it 's neutrality . 
  better to wait until we have the text of the agreement public , no ? 
  sure , how about i explain in the context of an actual isds case that happened ? 
  i wrote a post about it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2srn0u/trade_secrets_why_will_no_one_answer_the_obvious/cnsffwo ) . 
  what do you mean they already exist ? 
  only eight eu countries have isds provisions with the us . 
  more eu countries would like isds provisions with the us , because the us is one of the countries that likes to institute ` buy america ' provisions and the like . 
  isds provisions are only for enforcement for that treaty , and that treaty alone . 
  it would mean that american state and federal governments ca n't discriminate against european companies , as they so frequently do . 
  the average citizen gains by having their investments protected ( most people own shares in a company , if that company is discriminated against then they lose money ) , there 's more stability for business meaning fewer companies will close down and there 'll be more employment . 
  they 're no longer held behind closed doors , and all evidence thus far is that they have been fair . 
  do you have any evidence that they have n't been fair ? 
  they were in a position to demand that , because the egyptian government wanted a well run respectable firm to work there and those were the conditions of the firm to work there . 
  i 'm sure if they did n't have the option , they would 've gone with someone else . 
  but they did n't . 
  if the government wanted to raise the minimum wage while still keeping the contract valid , they couldve just transferred some money to veolia to match the increase in minimum wage . 
  you still do n't understand the connection between isds and uncitral/icsid ? 
  really ? 
  so you 're against companies suing for reasons you do n't like ? 
  you do n't believe in the rule of law ? 
  the legal system is far more complex than that , they have a reasonable case to make under the bit that was signed , and you want to take that away just because you do n't like it ? 
  i do n't need to link to academics , i 'm happy linking to source documents . 
  namely where the eu rather explicitly states that what those articles are saying is bullshit . 
  no , but i 've disagreed with bits containing isds clauses between countries that ca n't afford to fight them . 
  just because they 've been abused in some areas , does n't mean the whole system is broken . 
  between wealthy countries it works great . 
  no , the scientific tests with the best objective methodology . 
  i think you 've already seen my other posts about the power plant and the cigarettes , but with respect to the veolia case that 's something else altogether . 
  that 's actually a contract dispute , in that the egyptian government signed a contract with veolia guaranteeing wage stability for them to operate the garbage disposal there . 
  the increase in minimum wage violated that contract , plus there were a number of other issues that veolia had that are part of the complaint ( such as that they were n't being fairly treated by the police ) . 
  it 's based on a bilateral investment treaty . 
  regardless , everyone expects the cigarette company to lose . 
  because governments can always set higher standards that will harm foreign investors to protect their domestic businesses . 
  if the higher standard has a reasonable backing , the company will lose . 
  if it does n't , it 's just protectionism . 
  i 'm gon na presume there 's a / s at the end of your comment and upvote you . 
  you will . 
  it 'll be publicly released for more than a year before it 's even voted on . 
  ceta finished negotiating some time last year , the text was released in september and they still have n't even voted on that yet . 
  guess the question is who to trust - the eu that 's actually negotiating the damn thing , or some people that have no involvement in the treaty at all and do n't know the inner workings . 
  well , that would n't be discrimination under isds unless the standard was implemented after the introduction of the treaty , and there was no objective backing ( expert testimony , studies , etc ) that the new standard was better . 
  well , i do n't know what you 've read so i ca n't comment , all i can suggest is that maybe you 're not very good at picking your sources . 
  glad you found them useful !, 
  you were wrong about isds being secret , you were wrong about the agreement being secret for four years after the negotiations were finished , you did n't even know what uncitral or icsid were ... you simply have an elementary knowledge of treaty negotiation , isds , and ttip in general . 
  learn from that , rather than getting angry at me for pointing it out . 
  you 've been grossly misinformed about everything else so far , and usually ` text ' in the context of international negotiation refers to the trade agreement as it stands . 
  hence why when i said `` journalists are the last ones i 'd trust to review the texts '' , i meant they 're the last ones i 'd trust to review the treaty . 
  how am i doing that ? 
  what ? 
  lawyers are the ones that write the agreements . 
  journalists just write about the agreement ( or the negotiating texts , as their leaked ) and generally do n't have the academic grounding to understand what they 're reading , nor are they generally specialized in the field of international trade or international treaty negotiation . 
  lawyers mostly . 
  you clearly did n't finish reading , or you 'd see the next sentence where he says ;  the rest of the time , like headlamps , it 's just arbitrarily different . 
  journalists are n't the ones writing the text . 
  we should n't have anyone reviewing the texts yet , because they 're not finished and are subject to change substantially by the time the final agreement is made . 
  my stance has always been we should wait until the final text is presented before judging one way or another , instead of tilting at windmills - and as for journalists , they 're the last ones i 'd trust to review the texts given the horrible job they 've made of mangling it in the past . 
  if you 're genuinely interested in learning more , i 've written a few posts about topics related to ttip in the past . 
  [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32bdez/my_grandad_reads_the_paper_everyday_and_hasnt/cq9w6y2 ) i wrote about why the negotiations themselves have to be conducted in secret . 
  it 's not comprehensive , but gives a good eli5 . 
  [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2srn0u/trade_secrets_why_will_no_one_answer_the_obvious/cnsffwo ) i go over how isds works , and go over a few cases . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/tb/38asua ) i go over how arbitration panels are selected , and what their role is . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/308mny/mps_denounce_government_ttip_plans_amid_fears_for/cpqd4n4 ) i go over a few more cases to show how some ngos completely skew what happens in these cases . 
  yes , the ttip documents ( not the ttip agreement ) are the negotiating texts .
