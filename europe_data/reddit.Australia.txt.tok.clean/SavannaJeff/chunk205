  2300 times in the three months they 've been publicly available they 've been click on . 
  that 's pathetic compared to things like the anti-ttip petition , and many major news outlets were reporting on it . 
  it 's abundantly clear that most people do n't bother educating themselves on the issue , they pick a side and stick with it through thick and thin . 
   these are non-binding draft texts anyway . 
  does n't mean most people do n't stop viewing leaks and fearmongering as if that 's what will be in the final text . 
  2 million europeans have signed the stop-ttip initiative , [ only a few thousand have even bothered to read the resources provided by the eu on ttip ] ( http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/ttip-und-freihandel/kaum-jemand-liest-die-ttip-dokumente-13542243.html ) in the first three months that so much material was published online, 
  jesus , what the fuck ? 
  and this has what to do with europe ? 
  yes , we 're in agreement . 
   if any trade agreement/treaty/law even allows one interpretation where it 's a threat to internet freedom , that 's enough to reject it and avoid it at all costs in the future . 
  laws are not literature , they 're meant to have one interpretation , which should be exact and as narrow as possible . 
  this is completely out of line with reality . 
  there 's a reason we have judges and courts , and that 's because laws have to be interpreted - a legislature may have an intent when they create a law , but that 's not sufficient for the judiciary . 
   consider the people writing these things - international trade agreements are drafted by lawyers and legal experts , they 're not stupid . 
  if something is written to be vague , that 's the intent . 
  simply not the case , and this is why there are so many legal challenges - because the law is purposefully vague when necessary ( for breadth ) , and narrow when necessary ( for scope ), 
  what the fuck are you talking about ? 
   transfer or access to source code 1 . 
  no party may require the ** transfer of , or access to ** , source code of software owned by a person of another party , as a condition of providing services related to such software in its territory . 
  you see ? 
  why the fuck would they introduce something that does n't allow open source ? 
  it makes zero fucking sense what-so-ever , yet you keep parroting this line . 
  the whole point of this clause is to prevent some dumbfuck ministry from shithole country palming off the code to a knock off developer to make a cheaper version/one that they could market themselves . 
  that 's why it 's saying `` transfer of , or access to '' . 
  not to ban open source outright , which is just fucking ludicrous . 
  jesus christ , if you do n't get it now then i 'm done trying to get through to you . 
  keep living in your dystopia where governments conduct acts clearly , blatantly , and egregiously against their own interest . 
   the problem is that a country can no longer mandate software to be open source . 
  you can repeat this as much as you like , it 's simply not true . 
  the guy that wrote the article does n't even have a fucking law degree , but you 're taking his word for it . 
  yes , i did read the article . 
  i told you i disagree with that interpretation . 
  it 's relating to specific instances of using a piece of software , not about broad usage . 
  a government can mandate open source software . 
  it just ca n't , if it chooses to go a non-open source route , ask for the source code of the software it uses there except for in areas of critical infrastructure . 
  the eff always takes extreme interpretations on matters such as these . 
  their job is basically to scare people into opposing anything that could conceivably be a threat to internet freedom . 
  they 're not talking about having open source software , they 're talking about access to the source code of software . 
  the clause is clearly not envisaged as a way to prevent governments from using open source , but rather from governments requiring companies to hand over source codes for government purposes . 
  prepare for the downvotes . 
  an illegal immigrant is someone that moves to a country illegally , without intending to claim refugee status or any other kind of status that would allow them to be there legally ( what so many people here euphemistically call economic immigrants ) . 
  if someone intends to request asylum but they did n't cross the border via proper channels , they 're not an illegal immigrant , they 're an irregular migrant . 
  no , the article is . 
  you 've misinterpreted . 
  it 's basically only if a company has tendered an offer for their software to be used . 
  if the government wants to use open source software , they 're otherwise free to do so . 
  it 's * conditional * on an agreement between the two , which is n't necessary in open source . 
  not at all . 
  you should re-read it , they 're just saying a government ca n't demand the source code to any software they use that 's not critical infrastructure . 
  that 's literally all it says . 
   no party may require the ** transfer of , or access to , source code ** of software owned by a person of another party , ** as a condition of providing services related to such software in its territory . 
  there are plenty of ways to process them and determine where they 're from without having their documents . 
  because techdirt has a long history of completely misrepresenting provisions in trade agreements ( why the fuck are they even commenting on them anyway ? 
  they 're a tech website ) . 
  anyway , i disagree with your interpretation of the article . 
  they 're saying a government ca n't demand the source code to a program unless it 's critical infrastructure , not that a government ca n't use open source . 
  those are n't refugees , they 're unprocessed irregular migrants . 
  if france actually decided to process them , then they could send back those that are n't refugees and take appropriate measures for those that are . 
  it 's an article that has been proposed by one country , opposed by one other , and the other nations have n't commented on it yet . 
  so first , it 's unlikely that it will go through if it 's as bad as techdirt suggests , but more likely techdirts interpretation ( as it so often is when commenting on topics like the tpp or ttip ) is completely out of line with reality . 
  it 's an article proposed by japan , opposed by colombia , and the other nations have n't had their input yet . 
  suffice to say , even if techdirts interpretation of the article were correct , it 's far from something set in stone . 
  edit : their interpretation is wrong . 
  they 're just saying a government ca n't demand the source code to any software they use that 's not critical infrastructure . 
  that 's literally all it says . 
   no party may require the ** transfer of , or access to , source code ** of software owned by a person of another party , ** as a condition of providing services related to such software in its territory . 
  that tisa will prevent governments from mandating that they use open source software . 
  of course , everyone will read this as * will * even though it 's probably pretty unlikely to happen . 
  no , that 's not what i mean . 
  i broadly sympathize with your views , but have you considered that maybe just jumping into each of these topics and writing one liners about patriots is n't the most constructive thing to do ? 
  also , because turkey does n't treat their refugees well , nor do they provide adequate facilities . 
  it 's a disaster rate for australia as well . 
  my god , there 'd be riots on the streets . 
  i was going to say this !, 
   yeah , because that 's definitely why they want to leave the eu , because they want the empire back . 
  this seems to be the motivation of a bunch of kippers in particular . 
  every time trade is brought up , they act as if the commonwealth has just been * dying * for the uk to leave the eu and embrace us back in their loving bosom , as if we have n't spend the last 40 years reorienting our trade to more natural trading partners . 
  damn , i 'm really sorry to hear you 're going as a moderator . 
  as it stands , i agree with everything you 've written as well . 
  yeah , maybe it 's because i have n't been on the receiving end , but i always presumed he did good work . 
  he helped me out with a stalking user one time . 
  there was a great deal more signal to noise in the past . 
  most comments were more than a paragraph , and users like / u/spin0 and / u/countvontroll would frequently make fantastic posts explaining the intricacies of a given issue . 
  these days , it 's much harder to get quality discussion on a topic . 
  yep , and i 'm looking forward to it . 
  i find myself only checking / r/europeans once a week and comment only every few months , but it 's still a good place now - albeit without the discussion . 
  the transfer to a / r/europeans did n't work out as intended , sadly , despite / u/weniger 's heroic efforts . 
  fair enough . 
  he does seem like a bad choice if all that is true . 
  that does n't change the fact that / r/europe should n't become more ` democratic ' . 
  it was a post in polandball , a sub that takes national stereotypes and takes them to extremes . 
  find me some posts in regular subs where he 's actually such a person , and maybe i 'll support you . 
  but until then , i have no reason to agree with you . 
  you allow anything to be posted , and targeted and dedicated groups will quickly dominate the front page and the discussion section . 
  i do n't want a more democratic / r/europe . 
  democracy is for countries , not for online communities that can ( and do ) get brigaded with relative ease . 
  slippery slope argument ? 
  come on man ... 
  secret rules ? 
  how will one know whether to follow them or not ?
