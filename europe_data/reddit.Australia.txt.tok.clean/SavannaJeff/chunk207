  the links that the guardian website made of this to ttip are tenuous at best and spurious at worst . 
  the actual minutes are far more innocuous than that . 
  dg trade basically said that they would allow for a mechanism to exchange views ( which has been leaked in the past , and is completely non-binding ) . 
  i imagine that the reason they said the part you quoted was justification for not suggesting a more stringent mechanism . 
   the treaty would , according to the leaked drafts by the eu commission , allow us companies to sell gmo products unlabeled in the eu . 
  this is simply untrue , and i challenge you to find a source . 
  if you read the leaked documents , you 'll see it was n't us negotiators , it was just the american chamber of commerce that raised their concerns . 
  these documents are lacking any further context , and it is difficult to paint a whole picture of what happened based on those leaks .

  according to [ this ] ( http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ecfr124_-_ttip.pdf ) germany ranks an eight ( out of a maximum of 10 ) for gains from ttip . 
   almost all consumer protection laws would be abolished . 
  this is simply complete bullshit . 
  actually , it 's the eu that wants this considerably more than the us . 
  the us has the tpp it 's satisfied with . 
  now you 're just being childish . 
  you understand the negotiations are n't between a corporation and a country , they 're between two countries , right ? 
  i gave you the legal reasoning , and said they were n't going to win . 
  now stop following me around and pestering me . 
  what 's wrong with the uruguay claim ? 
  the same argument i made for the australia one can be made for uruguay . 
  you can read their statement of claim [ here ] ( http://www.smoke-free.ca/eng_home/2010/pmivsuruguay/pmi-uruguay%20complaint0001.pdf ) . 
  again , you come to me with nothing and expect everything . 
  i 'm no longer responding to you . 
  because i source my comments , unlike the guardian . 
  anyone is free to check up if i 'm talking bullshit or not . 
  i do n't have an agenda , and i 'm not defending ttip , i 'm just arguing against the bad arguments that get put forth . 
  if they were n't making shitty arguments , i would n't be knocking them down . 
  personally , i 'm waiting until ttip is released before taking a stance . 
  also , my stake in the matter is that i live in europe . 
  why do n't you link me to specific cases and i 'll happily take a look , but i 'm not going to guess what you 're talking about all the time . 
  learn to have a civilized discussion or stop pestering me . 
  you 're making me do all the work and you 're contributing nothing yourself . 
  are you fucking kidding ? 
  i linked you to [ this comment ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/36j4rj/ive_read_obamas_secret_trade_deal_elizabeth/creo7lp ) and [ this comment ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2srn0u/trade_secrets_why_will_no_one_answer_the_obvious/cnsffwo ) about isds . 
  both of which explain why isds is n't the evil thing most people think it is . 
  and you think i 've made no arguments ? 
  it 's clear there 's no point continuing this with you . 
  have a nice evening . 
  that 's all you read ? 
  you did n't read any of the two linked comments there about isds ? 
   yes i did . 
  it just does n't convince me if someone ( supposedly from australia ) tells me i should n't worry about isds and the food standarts because a ) is n't as bad and b ) wo n't happen anyway . 
  are you fucking serious ? 
  you are really surprised that i 'm not buying into that ? 
  you have n't made any arguments except `` no , your wrong , ttip is bad '' . 
  did you even read my comments ? 
  are you kidding ? 
  i do n't understand , how are you not getting it ? 
  the arbitration courts in english are isds . 
  the comment i told you to read through ? 
  that specifically mentioned isds . 
  go back and read it . 
   schiedsgerichte this is investor state dispute settlement . 
  isds . 
  because i linked to two of my comments about that !, 
  as to food , the director of dg trade ( the body responsible for negotiating ttip ) has already stated that they 're [ not going to lower eu standards as a result ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/commission-official-eu-not-going-change-its-food-legislation-because-ttip#.vhqw3url5sq.reddit ) . 
  the eu has also stated that they 're [ not going to change `` existing levels of protection ( consumer , environmental , health , etc ) for the sake of an agreement '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/questions-and-answers/ ) . 
   schiedsgerichte i do n't know what this is . 
  do you mean investor state dispute settlement ? 
  isds ?

  we have a winner !, 
  tell you what , read my post [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politicaldiscussion/comments/37akma/could_we_have_an_educated_discussion_about_free/crl34m7 ) and the posts i wrote that i linked there , and then if that 's not enough for you then i give up trying to convince you otherwise . 
  that 's the / r/european crowd for you . 
  stakeholder participation is an important aspect of the development of any policy . 
  a senior employee in a chemicals company knows far better how the us changing it 's regulations in chemicals will affect the industry than an average joe . 
  your opinion is simply unnuanced . 
  company officials are n't negotiating this . 
  i 've explained why [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ok63w/free_trade_with_us_europe_balks_at_chlorine/cmo550e ) . 
  also , it makes me feel smug and superior . 
  the people negotiating the agreements are n't politicians , they 've civil servants . 
  they have a strict mandate they have to follow . 
  except the eu has repeatedly stated that they 're not going to lower food standards . 
  yes , the us is trying to poison us . 
  so out of curiosity , who are the people that come into such threads and downvote everyone that is n't virulently anti-ttip ? 
  every one of my posts had three down votes within 10 minutes in this submission . 
  the eu has repeatedly stated their not going to lower such standards and regulations for the sake of ttip . 
  the issue is rather one of dual certification - making it so that , instead of making a headlight for a car thats 1mm taller and wider to meet the regulations of the us , they can just accept the eu certification because those headlight standards have been found to be equivalent ( that is , no objective reason for why one is better than the other ) . 
   the courts at all three levels noted that the case of accidental contamination beyond the farmer 's control was not under consideration but rather that mr. schmeiser 's action of having identified , isolated and saved the roundup-resistant seed placed the case in a different category yeah , sounds totally evil of monsanto ... 
  depends on if it 's a mixed competence agreement or not . 
  if isds is contained , it will definitely be a mixed competence issue meaning both national parliaments and the ep . 
  no , it 's just the negotiating texts ( the ones in between the beginning of negotiations , and when they finish negotiations ) . 
  the final agreement will be public for more than a year before it 's voted on . 
  ceta , the fta between the eu and canada , has been public since september and they still have n't voted on that . 
  ttip does n't lower regulations . 
  i did n't characterize opposition to ttip as anti-american , i characterized germany as pretty anti-american . 
  ah , that 's fair enough !, 
  i see you completely missed the part where i said `` and not without some justification '' . 
  why is no one protesting any of the other ftas that the eu is negotiating ? 
  where was the anger and furor over the recent fta with south korea or [ any of the other ftas theyve signed ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_free_trade_agreements ) ? 
  answer me that , please . 
  this topic comes up all the time here . 
  [ just this month it 's been submitted fourteen times ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=ttip&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all ) . 
  kinder surprise has stricter regulation in the us than in the eu . 
  but more seriously , their banks are much more tightly regulated as well .
