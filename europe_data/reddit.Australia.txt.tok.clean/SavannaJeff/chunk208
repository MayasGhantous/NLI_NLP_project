  only if isds is involved . 
  if it is n't , it 's less certain that it 'll be a mixed competence agreement . 
  just got ta look for them [ here 's the one i was talking about ] ( http://cdn.streamovations.be/events/ep/150305-1500-ttip-trade-and-regulatory-co-operation-benefits-and-costs.php ) . 
  i find the german stance completely hypocritical . 
  germany invented isds in 1959 . 
  it has 14 agreements including isds within the eu alone ( basically all with poorer countries ) , and dozens more around the world . 
  why is it only now , when the eu is negotiating with the us , that isds has become an issue ? 
   let me put it in another way : i do n't want to see any american corporation suing the eu because they believe our regulations are causing the former to lose profit ( and i bet neither the americans would like to have siemens or alstom doing that either ) . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  there 's no provision that allows them to sue for ` lost profits ' . 
  i 've written about isds myself a bunch of times on reddit as well ( even got submitted do / r/depthhub ! ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/36j4rj/ive_read_obamas_secret_trade_deal_elizabeth/creo7lp ) i go over a few isds cases , and why popular portrayal of them is completely misrepresenting reality ( as well as explaining when and how isds is done ) and [ here ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2srn0u/trade_secrets_why_will_no_one_answer_the_obvious/cnsffwo ) i went over how arbitration panels themselves work . 
  but suffice it to say , isds is nowhere near as bad as commonly portrayed , and it seems that the eu is particularly sensitive to this . 
  edit : typo, 
  [ the eu shelved negotiations on isds thanks to public consultation ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-3201_en.htm ) . 
  i do n't think you looked closely enough . 
  [ here is a textual proposal on technical barriers to trade ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/january/tradoc_153025.pdf ) . 
  it 's basically the idealized version of what the eu would like to see the agreement to look like in that section . 
  that 's hardly the world , china was richer and more powerful than rome was iirc . 
  [ call them or write to them ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/have-your-say/ ) . 
  i do n't know if you read the actual leaks , but i did . 
  the actual minutes are far more innocuous than that . 
  dg trade basically said that they would allow for a mechanism to exchange views ( which has been leaked in the past , and is completely non-binding ) . 
  i imagine that the reason they said the part you mentioned was justification for not suggesting a more stringent mechanism . 
  regardless , that was n't due to ttip , but rather due to regular diplomatic exchange . 
  well , there are a number of studies ( such as [ this one ] ( http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/faculty/07koremenos.pdf ) ) , as well as basically academic consensus on the subject , that negotiations in public are detrimental to the end result and to the public good . 
   one such fact is that it 's impossible to harmonise the eu `` precautionary principle '' with the fda `` cost-benefit impact-assessment '' . 
  it 's simply not possible because they contradict each other . 
  recent pesticide regulation ( harmful to the hormonal system , backed up by studies ) that did n't come into effect after american pressure is an example . 
  that was widely reported . 
  but this is not what they 're proposing to do . 
  they 're not harmonizing their regulatory agencies , they 're allowing dual certification of products where regulatory standards are already equivalent . 
   that 's simply a lie . 
  there is no broad isds between the us and europe right now . 
  apart form the fact that we do n't need them ( we have rule of law ) , ttip would n't `` tighten up '' anything . 
  ttip would expand isds drastically to all of the eu-us and have absolutely no impact on existing treaties which include isds . 
  you 're mistaken . 
  there are already 8 eu countries that have bits with the us , and those bits would be effectively supplanted by ttip - it 's one of the main reasons that poland ( which has been sued a number of times ) is so keen for ttip , it favours states rights much more strongly than past agreements . 
  no one is asking people to sign a contract now . 
  rather , this is more the stage where you 're speaking with your prospective employer about what the work will entail and what your benefits will be . 
  the contract will be drawn up later . 
  so the issue is less transparency , and more media reporting in that case . 
  there are a bunch of great debates that the eu has published online with senior figures giving answers in public hearings . 
  i do n't know if you 're familiar with it , but , capaldo who wrote a rather headline-making study on the economic impacts on ttip , was even invited to one of them and he debated with senior eu negotiators about the validity of his study ( i sided with the eu ) as well as other matters of the eu , the whole thing lasted some 3 hours and they 've done a number like it . 
  closed door negotiation remains a necessity . 
  negotiating tactics do n't work if they 're done under public scrutiny . 
  lets say the eu proposes to drop steel tariffs to nil if the us in perpetuity to end the wto imposed penalties for hormone beef . 
  the eu might not even actually intend to drop steel tariffs , they just want to open up discussions about the beef . 
  but domestically under open negotiations , the steel industry would immediately see the eu as public enemy number one and lobby hard against it . 
  except imagine this done by every sector . 
  and politicians especially should not be involved . 
  can you imagine the negotiations if john `` corn belt '' idaho could sabotage them for his own pork-barrelling needs . 
  negotiators need to be a step removed from politics , like central banks are . 
  they need to be able to negotiate without some dumbfuck rural party conservative politician insisting on some minor provision that helps their electorate , but which one or more of the other negotiating parties simply will not accept . 
  i do n't know if you 've noticed , but i comment about ttip a lot , and even when i present nothing but facts it gets downvoted . 
  there 's a real ideological crowd here . 
  out of curiosity , what kind of transparency measures would you like implemented that the eu has n't already done ? 
  that 's a load of bullshit . 
  [ here is the negotiating mandate ] ( http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf ) [ here is a fact sheet about why the eu wants isds ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/march/tradoc_152273.pdf ) . 
  [ here is where they post the results of the consultation and their decision to shelve isds ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-3201_en.htm ) [ here is where they ask for the publics thoughts ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/have-your-say/ ) . 
  [ here they have a bunch of resources specific to ttip ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/documents-and-events/index_en.htm ) [ here is where they go into specifics about different chapters ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/press/index.cfm?id=1230 ) . 
  that last one , each link on there has been clicked an average of 2300 times since they first put it up around the start of the year . 
  only 2300 times each !, 
  and yet 2 million people sign an anti-ttip petition ... 
  how is it rotten ? 
  germany is pretty anti-american ( and not without some justification ) full stop . 
  oh i dunno , whenever they provide an analysis of a text they sensationalize it to a tremendous degree . 
  if you read the source documents , that 's not because of ttip . 
  yeah , they call him `` one term tony '' for a reason . 
  because like i said yesterday , i was n't speaking about edcs , i was speaking about the fact that there 's only a spurious link at best between the minutes of the meeting and ttip . 
  charming , you argue your point so well . 
  and the number indicated upvotes . 
  they 're not changing safety assessment , from my understanding . 
  they 're literally just looking at existing standards , and seeing which ones are about the same , and giving dual certification for that . 
  the people have a responsibility to be informed and keep their politicians in check . 
  they did n't . 
  kinder surprise . 
  but it 's not about banning or not banning substances , as i said . 
  it 's about things like regulations on tail lights . 
  there 's no ` justifying the current conditions ' there 's just the facts on the ground . 
  you 're the one that raised ` greedy pensioners ' , when it was those pensioners that sold the country down the river to live beyond their means for some three decades and screw over the present generation . 
  if the greek government can find the terms for an agreed partial default , then great . 
  otherwise , a greek default would mean stealing from all the countries that managed their finances responsibly . 
  the facts are what they are . 
  i wish we could do more to help the greek people , but i 'm not going to absolve greek civil society of responsibility . 
  they 're not children , actions have consequences . 
  you 're right , sorry . 
  corporations are evil . 
  politicians , lawyers , and car salesmen are all evil . 
  ngos are non biased actors who only get about what 's best for everyone . 
  the world is black and white . 
  maybe if they had n't had worse budget deficits than -5 % for seven of the last thirty years , they would n't be in this state . 
  damn , i 'd had you pegged as a smart guy ( there 's a green number next to your name ) , but now that you 've resorted to calling me a shill i 'm going to have to revise that . 
  deliberation , to a fault . 
  i 've personally become quite a big fan of ciudadanos , but since i ca n't read spanish i was wondering if anyone could give me a run down why they might not be as good as i think . 
  for the record , i lean liberal democrat ( uk ) and alde ( ep ) . 
  i sincerely doubt there will be a reasonable level of risk here . 
  and that does n't change the misleading reporting of the guardian . 
  the source is linked in the article . 
   will they be bound by an agreement within the ttip ?
