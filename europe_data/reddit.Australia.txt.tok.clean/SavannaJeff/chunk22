  ah , so you downvoted me . 
  care to answer why , or do you always just post something in my direction , and then disappear when i ask you to clarify ? 
  actually rather balanced reporting . 
  was n't expecting that from vice . 
  why ca n't russia ever stir something nice , like a borscht ? 
  because you 're not allowed to refuse refugees asylum according to the refugee convention and sweden 's own laws , whereas the sd crowd wants sweden to go against it 's international obligations . 
  sweden has just interpreted the refugee convention more strictly than most other countries , and so once you interpret it in a more loose sense you 're essentially admitting you do n't give a fuck about what i 've heard one sd person refer to as the ` feel-good ' laws , running from refugee asylum to stuff like anti-discrimination . 
  at least , that 's one possible interpretation . 
  there are benefits to having eu citizenship with regards to education . 
  you get treated as a native in basically every country , meaning that if you want to study in sweden ( where it 's free ) , you will also be able to study for free . 
  especially in a subreddit where the majority of the people within it do n't have english as a native language . 
  actually , he did n't call you racist , he asked if you thought racism was funny or amusing . 
  i do n't think he was implying that you were a racist , but rather a psychopath that gets pleasure out of such things . 
  because it 's tied into the problem of illegal immigration to europe . 
  we want to stop illegal immigration , and this is a symptom of it , so the sooner europe can stop people needing to come here , the better it will be for europe and for those that drown . 
  do you think what 's going on in libya now is anywhere near as brutal and serious as what 's going on in syria ? 
  and that 's better than if it descended into a long , protracted , brutal civil war like in syria . 
  it was run by a dictator , and of course it was undemocratic !, 
  the established order was on the way out anyway , western intervention just sped the process up to prevent the quagmire that exists in syria . 
  i do n't believe it 's racism to be against mass third world immigration , and i have no problem with europeans being allowed to keep their ethnic identity . 
  nor do i spend all day shouting either of those things , so i do n't know why you 're saying that . 
  i 'd really love if you people would actually read what i wrote . 
  i 'm not an open borders advocate . 
  i do n't think europeans have to lose their ethnic identity . 
  i do n't think europe should have mass third world immigration . 
  yet , you guys assign all these kinds of things to me instead of reading what i actually argue for . 
  how am i a marxist ? 
  actually , a protracted civil was in libya would 've destabilized the region , disrupted oil and has sales , and created more refugee problems . 
  that 's why he had to go , i never claimed it was a humanitarian effort, 
  heh , that 's an unsurprising argument coming from you . 
  it was more than just a few people , the civil war was well on it 's way already . 
  nato just sped things along . 
  i also read the defence from canada , they basically did n't even contest that there was no added health risk . 
  so you see , this was n't a bill to help environment or health problems as was claimed . 
  the company sued because they were being defamed and discriminated against by protectionist politicians . 
  but regardless , i edited something in whilst you were replying , you might want to reread my previous post . 
  you mean the un sanctioned mission in libya which helped to topple a violent dictator who was paying mercenaries to indiscriminately shoot people from the top of buildings ? 
  to keep the conflict continuing so it more closely resembled syria than than what it does now ? 
  i defend isds because i see it 's value in a well structured treaty . 
  not all isds clauses are alike . 
  but what 's most interesting is that the paper you linked at the end was * the same one i linked * to show that the health claims were unfounded . 
  pages 4 to 6 of that paper you linked to at the bottom specifically reference canadian health findings about manganese oxides produced from the combustion of the additive , and how it is at a safe level . 
  i mean , did you even read the things i linked to you ? 
  because it seems clear that you did n't given that you link me to the same thing i linked you to , trying to prove your point , despite it supporting mine . 
  edit : i see now . 
  you got this quote `` in official report it clearly says that the goverment / health department did n't see a direct problem with mmt , but with the `` mangase oxides produced upon combustion of the additive '' . '', 
  without reading the whole thing . 
  they said they were concerned about it ( it 's under point 17 if you need a reminder ) , and then conducted a study which found there to be no problems with the levels . 
  ** particularly where in part 18 they quote the health report that states that : **  `` all analysis indicates that the combustion products of mmt in gasoline do not represent an added health risk to the canadian population '' ~ ~ which is amusing , because when you accuse me of cherrypicking quotes/sources , it 's actually you that was doing it . ~ ~ mistakes happen, 
  i never claimed it discouraged trafficking . 
  the person i replied to was talking about the calais case , and i explained why the french and not the british were responsible for the people in calais . 
  as to how they know , they have methods . 
  they ask where someone is from , what village , etc , keep questioning until they slip up . 
  if they do n't slip up , they can find someone from that certain region and check if the accent is correct , if they use the right regional words , etc. 
  like , socialist ? 
  except european companies are the ones most likely to use isds provisions , and if you 've ever bothered to study any of the isds cases ( beyond reading a single paragraph in a newspaper article ) , you 'd find they were generally justified upon resolution . 
  the idea that there 's a transfer of sovereignty from europe to the us is just bullshit , but maybe i 'm wrong and you can explain to me by what processes and how that happens ? 
  because those people are n't requesting asylum in nafrican countries , they 're trying to do it in europe . 
  once in europe , under the dublin 3 agreement , the people have to be sent back to their first point of entry into the eu for processing . 
  africa is not involved in the dublin 3 agreement . 
  the french have a legal responsibility to deal with the migrants in calais , the africans do n't . 
  eh , i do n't think that was the case . 
  i 've been arguing with people on the subject in / r/europe for months , those that i 've discussed with have each fallen into one of those categories . 
  i also left room for manoeuvre with the ` mostly ' . 
  i do n't follow any set ideology . 
  i believe some aspects of neoliberalism can be beneficial , others can be harmful , just as i believe some kind of protectionism can be beneficial whilst others harmful . 
  the case is actually much more complicated than you portray it . 
  there was no scientific basis for the claim ( concentrations of the harmful chemical were hundreds of times higher in their daily food intake , than from what they 'd get from the fumes ) . 
  furthermore , the bill was more one which was determined to be more likely one that was based around economic protectionism for canada , more than for health reasons . 
  finally , it was determined that it was regulatory expropriation of both the intellectual property , and of the good will of the company ( on the basis that many canadian officials statements were critical of ethyl corp needlessly ) . 
  you can read through their submission [ here ] ( http://www.naftaclaims.com/disputes/canada/ethylcorp/ethyl-04.pdf ) and of a legal analysis of the case [ here ] ( http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?pid=s1692-81562009000200010&amp;script=sci_arttext ) . 
  the canadian government had to apologise because their claims ** were unfounded based on their own studies ** . 
  because they 're coming here ? 
  the best way to stop the boats coming is to stop the reason why they 're coming , and that 's in europe 's interest ( half the flow of illegal migrants ) and in the interests of the people who 's lives are lost . 
  i 'm not a neocon and i 'm not right wing . 
  what was uncivil about my initial reply ? 
  i was under the impression indonesia was less extremist . 
  it 's europe 's problem to rectify , not africa 's . 
  africa does n't give a hoot if they 're going to europe . 
   curtailing a states power to repel laws down the road is an affront to state sovereignty do n't you think . 
  it 's basically removing the right to self determination in my view . 
  this is the case with every international treaty . 
  all treaties curtail sovereignty , they can not be repealed except under exceptional circumstances according to the vienna convention governing treaties . 
  that 's what i meant when i said anti-globalist , it 's a fundamentally isolationist notion to reject forming treaties with other countries because it * might * be bad for you in the future , regardless of current benefit . 
  i did n't argue that westphalian sovereignty has been eroded , i argued it 's been redefined with the drastic explosion of international treaties . 
  the world is n't the same as it was in 1648 . 
  for banana republics , countries have other methods of recourse . 
  isds is for the more subtle kind of protectionism , that based around imposing laws of which the implicit purpose is the protection of national industry , rather than whatever the stated purpose of the legislation is . 
  ca n't we have a civil discussion ? 
  that was n't my question , i asked why * you * were against it . 
   but they sound like a right wing populist party . 
  they are . 
  ok , so why are you against the ttip , if you are and you do n't fall under those categories ? 
  i mean , what i said before is n't equivalent to your comparison between `` enhanced interrogation '' is n't torture . '' . 
  i agree that most cases ( i do n't know what 's classified as enhanced interrogation and what is n't ) are torture , such as waterboarding . 
  but that 's not equivalent to my comment earlier . 
   australians would make this show many many more times more tacky/camp/trashy than it already is is n't this the appeal ? 
  the two are not equivalent . 
  that 's a poor statement , and you know it . 
  businesses do n't have the power to overrule governments .
