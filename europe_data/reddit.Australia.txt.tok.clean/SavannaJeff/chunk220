  a few months ago there was one italian gentleman that proposed recolonizing the entire north african coast as , thanks to the roman empire , it should be european anyway ... 
  again , it 's not free movement that 's the issue , it 's that under the dublin 3 regulations they 're supposed to be processed in the first country they enter . 
  spain , portugal , greece , italy ... their systems are already overwhelmed , so sometimes its easier to just send them on their way rather than follow the policy . 
  well , that 's part of what processing is supposed to determine , where they 're from . 
  they generally determine it by dialect , accent , slang words that are used , etc. 
  no , i understood what you said . 
  but no policy is perfect , and as i said , outliers like the one you described will exist in any system . 
  it does n't mean we should scrap the whole thing . 
  calais is n't a symptom of free movement , it 's a symptom of a poorly function european policy on processing asylum seekers . 
  the uk government had a whole massive report about the topic that said that immigration was providing a net benefit . 
  if you have some better statistics that show that eu immigration is awful , please , present them . 
  but until then , the only objective facts we have are from that report . 
  they 're not ignored because of that . 
  they 're ignored because they 're statistically irrelevant . 
  if 99.99 % of something is fine , and .01 % is bad , then you do n't start saying `` well , because of this .01 % we 're going to get rid of it ! '', 
  i 'm a bank shill , i do all the lobbying and shilling for corporate banksters . 
  i do n't think you can look at outliers and say that it 's complete chaos . 
  the overwhelming majority of eu migrants find work , fit in , and do n't cause problems . 
  how is it unfair ? 
  free movement is a cornerstone of the eu . 
  there is no way they can get rid of it . 
  no , all banks are the same , there is no distinction between commercial banks and central banks , and they 're all filled with evil corporate lobbyists . 
   libyans were much better off under gaddafi . 
  well , until he hired foreign mercenary snipers to start indiscriminately killing people in the streets ... 
  in australia , when they spot a vessel they 'll sometimes sink their own ships specifically to be rescued . 
  if they request asylum their processed . 
  if they are determined to be refugees , they 're allowed to stay . 
  if not , they 're deported . 
   you want to back that up with facts ? 
  everyone knows about the evil corporate bankers shilling and lobbying and in general being evil . 
  they did say with ww2 . 
  i would n't be surprised if that mob did n't believe in climate change either , so they wo n't have to worry about that, 
  this was done by the soviet union . 
  russia is its only successor state , but i do n't see them doing that . 
  [ enjoy ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-3201_en.htm ) . 
  uncitral is even in vienna , so technically it 'd be austrian staffers . 
  i would n't criticze the policy as racist . 
  i 'm perfectly happy to just let the un , the australian legal community , not to mention the international community , make all the many ( justified ) criticisms about how the policy is a human rights violation , inhumane , unjust , etc. 
  some 97 % of the responses were form responses , the ones you just basically just copy into an email and send without any actual thought about it . 
  because defence procurement is n't covered by wto , and secondly there 's no legal basis for challenging it domestically . 
  ` illegal refugee ' ... there 's no such thing . 
  yep , [ there was ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-3201_en.htm ) , specifically about isds . 
  how the hell does that work ? 
  i do n't know why the idea that refugees have to be poor took hold . 
  the jewish population of europe was relatively prosperous . 
  hawke-keating was the greatest wombo-combo australia ever had , politically and despite their falling out . 
  has n't been anyone near their calibre since . 
  because the whole isds process is n't a ` court ' , despite people trying to simplify the explanation of the process by using such legal terms . 
  it 's an arbitration . 
  when isds proceedings begin , there is first the attempt to try and find if there 's a solution that can be found - maybe the government can explain to the investor why they wo n't be unfairly harmed . 
  maybe the company can ask for the wording of the regulation in question to be more sensitive to the concerns of the investor . 
  only if they do n't find anything there ( the settlement ) , does it get to the point where the arbitration finds one way or the other . 
  i mean , do people even realize that all but eight eu countries already have agreements with the us containing isds provisions ? 
  and that those ones are on generally more unfavourable terms for the eu than what the eu is proposing ? 
  [ 68 % are found to be refugees after the first pass . 
  average rate of acceptance in total has been over or around 90 % 2008-2013 . p. 30 ] ( https://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/immigration-update/asylum-trends-aus-2012-13.pdf ) your claim that 99 % are economic migrants is , frankly , bullshit and insulting to all the refugees that flee persecution . 
  [ our former prime minister , bob hawke , sculling a pint in 10 seconds aged 83 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5mbshx9fdu ) . 
  he also had the world record for beer drinking , downing a yard of ale ( some 1.4 l ) in 11 seconds . 
  [ shane skillz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhaz8zk1wsg ) is probably the best representative of australian rap . 
  i actually wrote a post about that [ around a year ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z ) . 
  double time and a half . 
  i wish people would stop bringing up the whole ` secret courts ' thing . 
  they 're not secret anymore ( there have been huge transparency initiatives in recent years ) . 
  furthermore , that is completely bullshit . 
   because also a settlement normally means that states have to pay or the state and the investor agree to some kind of compromise , such as legislation more sensitive towards the concerns of the investor . 
  the idea that settlement means a payoff is ridiculous . 
  most of what you quoted is ridiculous . 
  yeah , but this story is n't about the mods , it 's about protests in germany over ttip . 
  no one should ever want or need tony abbott . 
  do n't think this is really the place to make such complaints ... 
  the fears around isds are completely overblown . 
  well , i was out last night and hence can only get to this now ( saturday night and all ) , but as a few people have mentioned i 'm probably the person that would seem the most ` pro ' in / r/europe . 
  and people got my reaction correctly as well , it 's silly to be against the deal when we do n't know what 's in it , but generally i 'm for free trade . 
  the deal will be public for more than a year before ratification , according to the director of dg trade , so there will be plenty of time for scrutiny then . 
  at the moment though , almost everything seems to be just fearmongering . 
  regurgitating the same claims that have been disproven time and time and time again . 
  lot of ttip news today . 
  the director of dg trade ( the body responsible for negotiating ttip ) has already stated that they 're [ not going to lower eu standards as a result ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/commission-official-eu-not-going-change-its-food-legislation-because-ttip#.vhqw3url5sq.reddit ) of the agreement . 
  the eu has also stated that they 're [ not going to change `` existing levels of protection ( consumer , environmental , health , etc ) for the sake of an agreement '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/questions-and-answers/ ) . 
  there is also zero evidence ( and in fact , the eu has said the opposite ) , about it 's ability to push for privatization in areas like the health care sector . 
  i mean , your entire post is one misconception after another . 
  i also wrote about why it has to be secret , and what the corporate involvement is , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/32bdez/my_grandad_reads_the_paper_everyday_and_hasnt/cq9w6y2 ), 
  oh god , i thought you 'd given up on the subreddit . 
  everywhere else you 're downvoted for the crazy conspiracy theorist you are , but for some reason in / r/europe your posts seem to find traction . 
  i just do n't get it . 
  i 've had a bit to drink , so forgive me for saying this , but i 've argued with people that have a bias . 
  i 've argued with people that have a viewpoint different than mine . 
  but you are probably the only one that 's literally too stupid to understand the nuances of the topic we 're discussing , regardless of the fact that i 've tried to explain it to you five or six times now . 
  gmo seems to be the last bullshit conspiracy theory that 's actually trendy . 
  actually , finland has [ a bunch of them ] ( http://investmentpolicyhub.unctad.org/iia/countrybits/71 ) , so you 're mistaken . 
  there was an attempt to create such an agreement back in the 1990s , called the mai . 
  public groups opposed it saying `` no , we do n't like the idea of companies suing governments ! '' . 
  the rules under the mai were rather strict and institutionalized , rather like the wtos dispute settlement mechanism . 
  but , like with isds under ttip , public groups just oppose shit based on how it sounds , and now how it works . 
  so many countries both in europe , africa , asia , etc , are under bilateral isds treaties instead of the much better multilateral one that they tried to form in the 90s . 
  and every time these morons protest , worse and worse rules keep slipping by , because they do n't know when to pick their fucking battles . 
  oh wow , you have touched on the perfect analogy . 
  everyone is an ` expert ' on football , but few people actually know how it really goes . 
  it 's easy to criticize from the sidelines , but anyone that 's not in it ... 
  anyway , i 'm gon na steal that , thanks !,
