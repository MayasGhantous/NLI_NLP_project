  britain and france had mutual defense treaties with poland against german attack , not against soviet attack . 
  germany started it . 
  i might have no aim to hit someone with my car , that does n't mean that if i hit someone with it that i did n't do it,

  ipad typing . 
  with a broken screen that likes to fuck up at the most awkward of times . 
  no , greece . 
  an ecb working paper gave a legal opinion indicating that leaving the eurozone would necessitate leaving the eu as well . 
  they had the highest gdp growth in the eurozone recently for a quarter , if hi here member correctly . 
  driven by deflation , in believe , but still ... 
  the guy is * very funny * about the whole ww2 thing . 
  passive revisionism kind of very funny , if you 've seen some of his other posts . 
  / r/european material very funny . 
  there 's still quite a bit of antisemitism in poland , i 've encountered educated young people that still blame things on the jews . 
  so does christianity , as everyone keeps mentioning , but i do n't see people suggesting an unholy crusade against christanity nearly as often as i do against islam . 
  regardless , i 'm a firm proponent of live and let live , and so far i have n't been inconvenienced or bothered by any muslims , so why would i be concerned about them ? 
  neither is ukraine . 
  so perhaps we can recognize that there is no monolithic muslim culture , and hence the stupidity of acting like there is one . 
   i find that the people who use these phrases `` there are no british values '' , `` british values are vague '' , '' britain has no culture '' or even worse `` white people have no culture '' are the same ` progressive ' , open-borders , cultural relativist types that only seem intent on pushing their ideology of shaming western ( typically white ) males ( that is if it is not just pure laziness on their behalf of thinking about british values ) . 
  open with a straw man , continue with a straw man and sprinkle in some idealistic ( and outright wrong ) rhetoric on topic . . 
  no true scotsman ? 
  indonesia ( which would fit in with the balkan and central asia type muslims ) is the largest muslim country on earth . 
  but they 're obviously also ` hardly muslim ' . 
  and yet it 's used repeatedly against people that do n't hold such beliefs . 
  it 's such a cheap method of dismissing what someone says . 
  i think you 're tilting at windmills here , mate . 
  perhaps one person in a thousand that gets called an sjw shares those characteristics that you mention , the rest are just people that say `` hey , maybe we should n't shoot refugees to try and stop more arriving '' . 
  i 'm quite certain the vague nature has a purpose , ie : being able to ban the regular / r/european brigaders with reference to the rules , rather than just summarily . 
  racist brigades ( let alone outright racism itself ) have long been a problem here . 
  you guys were linked to by srd . 
  furthermore , you guys are the cause of continuous brigades to / r/europe , every time you link here ( like you did about the rule changes ) . 
  the only reason people might be coming from / r/europe to / r/european right now , is because there are comments pointing out how / r/europe is being brigaded by / r/european . 
  why are you , an / r/european mod , trying to promote brigading from / r/europe to / r/european ? 
   but that should not necessarily lead to agreement , unnecessary courtesy or even undeserved respect . 
  i do n't think that cultural relativism leads to any of those things * for a culture * . 
  but part of what you 're writing also involves an interpersonal element , * courtesy and respect * , and that is often violated when speaking about people . 
  i can explain why i think that the process of genital mutilation is barbaric , but i 'm not going to take that out on a guy from a west african village whos parents , grandparents , etc dating back generations have all accepted this process as normal and does n't know what the fuss is about due to lack of education . 
  i ca n't disrespect or be discourteous to him for simply not knowing any better ( and even not being given the opportunities to know any different ) so i would n't start with `` those barbaric musos are at it again !, 
  '' , but i would be perfectly happy with saying that lashings , genital mutilations , etc , are barbaric practices which would be criticism of their culture . 
   it made him refuse to judge another culture as he believed that people outside of the culture of subject are incapable of having a decent opinion about it . 
  his rigid reluctance to draw any conclusions felt rather religious . 
  i ca n't claim to know the details of the discussion , but could it not be possible he was rather saying he could n't judge people from that culture ( after all , they do n't know any different , this is the system they grew up and were raised in and are thh fundamental building blocks of them as a social person ) , rather than that culture itself ? 
  i dunno , 20 % of the population ( if you count the whole of istanbul ) is quite a lot . 
  by that reasoning , why do we allow cyprus news ? 
  they 're technically not even in europe . 
  them , or / r/european . 
  edit : [ yep ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/european/comments/30un61/reurope_has_some_new_great_rules_bigotry_hate/ ) . 
  there 's plenty of discussion here on ttip , generally 4 or 5 large discussions a week , so i 'm uncertain why you think no one is speaking about it . 
   as empirical evidence has shown as , after a default there is obviously a big shock for a few months that is followed by rapid massive growth . 
  i would love a link to these metaanlyses you talk about . 
  the big issue with the whole sjw label is that , for every genuine tumblr batshit crazy sjw out there , 999 normal people who are n't ` sjws ' get labelled that for saying something completely reasonable . 
  it 's a huge fucking bogeyman , and completely useless given the way it 's being used . 
  i 'm not suggesting bringing them here , i 'm saying that if they arrive on our doorstep we should help . 
  it might not fix the problem , but it will fix the problem * for them * . 
  this is kind of the whole point of the refugee convention . 
  no one 's suggested save the world , but you can save those that come to you and need saving . 
  it 's always irritated me how people bring up bizarre hypotheticals about `` what if 50 million refugees arrived ?! '' . 
  that 's not happening . 
  let 's not start jumping to conclusions here . 
  dammit , i 'm tired by all the disinformation and blatantly wrong representations of the facts here . 
  i spend far too many hours each day trying to correct these people !, 
  in english , it 's `` cue '' , as in someones cue in the theatre to go on stage and start doing their thing !, 
  it does a better job of trying to be neutral than most , i 'll give them that , but it is a vice article so of course it 's not terribly nuanced . 
  yeah ? 
  how 's that ? 
  actually , less than half of users are american . 
  if i 'm explaining why in the north korean legal code , people can be sent to a death camp , am i supporting that , or am i explaining the legal reasoning ? 
  if i 'm trying to convince a ( lets say there 's one impartial judge ) judge that these people do n't deserve the death camp , they have to be judged by a legal system that does n't exist in north korea , and hence the north korean state and people ca n't pronounce a sentence on them , am i supporting the death penalty then ? 
  what if there are a bunch of other lawyers publishing letters in the newspaper about how the person deserves immediate death . 
  am i better than them for saying `` no , they do n't '' ? 
  or am i trying to reform the system from within to make sure people do n't get sent to death camps anymore ? 
  i 'm finished responding to you , i do n't feel there 's more i can say ( because complaints about my shitty analogy ) , so if you want the last word you 're welcome to it . 
  if you 're not going to bother trying to understand the nuance , then i 'm not going to continue this with you any further . 
  muslims only follow the muslim legal texts ( basically their holy texts plus a few influential scholarly opinions ) . 
  he is trying to create a majority opinion where * only the legal authority * can kill people for apostasy . 
  instead of looking for reasons why i 'm wrong , watch the video first and try and understand it from that perspective . 
   the major problem with ttip would be the lack of competitiveness between the sectors from different countries . 
  you 're really going to have to elaborate on this , because at the moment it 's not saying anything . 
  no , but islamic legal law is quite clear on the current interpretation of apostasy , and if he is acting to try and get fewer people killed by saying `` no , only the authorities can do this '' then i 'm going to applaud him . 
  i do n't look at things in utopian and idealistic terms , i look at them as they are , and this provides one of the best chances of minimizing muslim violence . 
  no , he 's not , he 's trying to limit the amount of vigilante action muslims carry out ( by killing apostates ) within the confines of islamic legal interpretation . 
  he does n't advocate killing these people , he 's saying you should n't kill them because it 's up to the authorities to do so if they deem it 's necessary . 
  have a read through the discussion i have [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/304351/activist_pulls_out_of_trinity_college_talk_due_to/cpp3reu ) for a more nuanced view . 
   yeah , i think we agree on the basics , if not the specifics . 
  i think it 's easy to sound pretty rabid on the internet . 
  lord knows i 've done my fair share of that . 
  i think you 've hit the nail on the head here . 
  if i see an article submitted to / r/europe about someone making a cartoon insulting mohammed , my first thought is to look at the context surrounding it . 
  if there is no apparent context or relevant raison d'etre , i assume the person is just a cunt and would denounce them accordingly , the same way that i would denounce someone that abuses random people on the street for shits and giggles . 
  i would defend their right to free speech , and their right to say provactive things . 
  but i firmly believe that there are things that should be legal ( free speech ) , but that we should refrain from doing in a civilized society ( purposefully trying to insult muslims with mohammed depictions , or abusing people randomly on the streets ) . 
  many people , however , would think that my criticism of the artist is attacking free speech , when actually i 'm calling for responsible civilized speech . 
  and this is where i think the issue lies . 
  many of the ` vocal internet leftists ' want to outright ban speech . 
  in general , i 'm not interested in banning speech , but i am interested in trying to make where i live a more civilized and accepting place . 
  and whilst there may be situations where satirical cartoons of mohammed are appropriate , i feel that too often they 're just used to provoke a response rather than done intelligently . 
  anyone , nice talking to you . 
  if you 'd bother to watch the youtube video , he 's not promurder . 
  he 's trying to explain to regular muslims why they should n't kill their exmuslim brothers for apostasy . 
  no one is restricting their speech .
