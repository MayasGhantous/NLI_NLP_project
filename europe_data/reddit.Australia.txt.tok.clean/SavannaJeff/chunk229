  the ec gets given a negotiating mandate by the member states , which dictates the terms of what they should be negotiating for . 
  i wish people would read the [ actual report ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13156.pdf ) instead of going off of guardian headlines , even if only the executive summary . 
  i have trouble respecting the guardian for that fact alone . 
  whoops !, 
  looks like reading comprehension is n't my strong suit either !, 
  thanks !, 
  i saw the en button at the top , tried that , then did a search for recent ttip articles and did n't find anything involving corporations being informed , so figured it was only in french . 
  the point is that the new berlin airport is a hugely expensive project with heavy criticism and huge cost overruns . 
  if they 're criticizing the ecb building , why not the new berlin airport as well ? 
  something i do n't think either of us will change the others mind on . 
  people are probably tired of me saying this , and you already know it , but ttip is * the most transparent trade agreement ever made * . 
  and the eu is still working on making it more transparent . 
  people should be applauding this , whilst still pushing for more , not bitching about it . 
  as a general rule , i agree - people who ask about ` geopolitics ' rarely have any clue about even the basics of the international system . 
  but these days it 's come to mean just a shorthand for some people referring to international affairs . 
  he makes some good points , though i 'm not sure i 'd phrase what he wrote in such a seemingly orchestrated conspiratorial way . 
  i do n't think the swedish elite purposefully responded to the killings of immigrants ( such as [ the lasermannen shootings ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_ausonius ) or the recent [ apparent copycat ones ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%e2%80%9310_malm%c3%b6_shootings ) ) in such a virulently anti-racist dogma , but rather it was a natural response to the barbarity of such acts . 
  this has , of course , certainly made it difficult to speak about immigration in sweden without allegations of racism , but at the same time , many of the people that complain about this are those that are * actually legitimately xenophobic/racist * ( note i 'm not saying all , or even most ) . 
  immigration is a very divisive issue in swedish society , and i 'm not entirely certain how best to solve this kind of swedish cognitive dissonance . 
  with respect to his comment about ` why the elites do n't send their kids to multicultural schools ' , i think the answer is self-evident - parents want the best for their kids , so they send them to schools that give them the best opportunities in life . 
  it 's a sad fact that such schools tend to be majority blonde-blue-eyed swede schools , rather than those schools that may have recent immigrants and under-privileged kids attending . 
  on the subject of immigrant participation in the workforce , he 's correct that sweden is ranked as one of the worst . 
  i recall reading an oecd report some time ago that showed that sweden was the worst in the western world at utilizing immigrant labour - that is , the old story of ` professors working as taxi drivers ' thing largely held true for sweden , and what 's more , studies have shown that those that have traditional swedish surnames are considerably more likely to be called in for an interview than those without . 
  it seems like a self-fulfilling prophecy . 
  immigrants do n't get hired because they 're immigrants , so people are unlikely to give immigrants jobs for the reason that they 're immigrants , and everyone knows they 're too lazy to get jobs/live off of welfare . 
  wish the article were in english . 
  the economist is generally pretty good as well , especially if you know what their biases are . 
  beyond that though , it depends on what your interests are . 
  i read eurasianet , for example , for my news on central asia , and generally the more localized you get , the more nuanced the reporting . 
  i dunno man , i 've seen this guys posts before . 
  i would n't be so certain it was sarcasm . 
  the one they started building back in 2008 ? 
  urgh , what idiots . 
  i 've had citizenship of a european country since i was 6 months old . 
  i have n't seen you employ it elsewhere , so i do n't see why you would here . 
  good day to you . 
  well , for example , [ ttip is n't going to suddenly allow chlorine chicken ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/18/wrong-george-monbiot-nothing-secret-eu-trade-deal ) . 
  the director of dg trade ( the body responsible for negotiating ttip ) has already stated that they 're [ not going to lower eu standards as a result ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/commission-official-eu-not-going-change-its-food-legislation-because-ttip#.vhqw3url5sq.reddit ) . 
  the eu has also stated that they 're [ not going to change `` existing levels of protection ( consumer , environmental , health , etc ) for the sake of an agreement '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/questions-and-answers/ ) . 
  so that covers the first case he brought up . 
  the second was isds . 
  he really oversimplified the quebec fracking isds case . 
  what actually happened was that quebec charged millions of dollars for exploration licenses to fracking companies . 
  those companies then spent millions more on investing in the area , acquiring all necessary certifications , etc before quebec decided to suddenly ban it . 
  nothing changed between the time quebec decided to issue the licenses , and the time if banned them , so it seems like it 's unfair on the companies who spend literally tens of millions of dollars in the area ( money they mightve spent elsewhere to already be making a profit ) are suddenly out of that money because a government caved in to populist pressure . 
  regardless , [ isds is nothing like is commonly reported anyway ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/truereddit/comments/2srn0u/trade_secrets_why_will_no_one_answer_the_obvious/cnsffwo ), 
  i 've never said that . 
  ive always only said that we should maintain our committments to the refugee convention . 
  if people come here through improper channels , they should be detained , be processed if they request asylum , and be allowed to stay if they 're deemed refugees . 
  if they 're deemed not to be refugees , they should be deported . 
  i challenge you to find a single post where i 've said anything about opening the borders . 
  that 's something the white rights people on / r/european say about me , nothing i 've ever actually said myself . 
   these posts are rare , they probably account for 1/5 of what you post . 
  it 's a ` flavour of the month ' kind of thing . 
  when the russian crisis was really hot , i was posting a lot about that . 
  when cap was really hot ( some two years ago ) , i was posting a lot about that . 
  when the cypriot banking crisis was hot , i was posting a lot about that . 
  refugee threads come up non stop , so on occasion i post in those . 
  i live in europe , and i have european citizenship . 
  but your attitude ( he 's a foreigner , he does n't have a right to an opinion ! ), 
  is very telling about your stance . 
   mass immigration ( in its illegal form ) i do n't even know what you 're referencing here , but yes i do post in many other areas than that - [ russia-ukraine ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ek2wv/what_do_you_want_germany_to_do_with_russia/ck08ks2 ) , [ common agricultural policy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1c736z/in_unusual_move_german_chancellor_has_invited_uk/c9drnm6 ) , [ greek crisis ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2v6iy1/your_honest_view_of_the_greek_porblem/coevxbu ) , [ eu-us trade disputes ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z ) , [ eurasian regional organizations ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2pohsq/belarusian_president_orders_trade_with_russia/cmyve00 ) , [ eu in general ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28y8or/united_states_of_europe_use/cifmx0t ) , etc. 
  i get it 's a comedy show , but it got quite a lot very wrong . 
  it ebbs and flows , some months are better than others , but this is some of the worst i 've seen it in a while . 
  / r/europe has turned into a massive fucking cesspool again . 
  ah , the same trick europe has been playing on turkey for decades !, 
  i recall hearing that discworld was supposed to live on through his daughter , who is also quite a good writer . 
  did i imagine that , or is it actually the case ? 
  sadly , you could see the alzheimer 's getting to him for a few years now , with his book ` raising steam ' being a little bit of a mess - the focus was more on the ideas than the characters , as in the past . 
  of course , but the point was that greece 's fiscal situation has been improving over the last 5 years , and it 's not like anyone is proposing that reform is over for greece and it should continue as it is . 
  that 's the whole point of the bailout program , to help greece get to a stage where they can service their own debt , and it 's likely to continue as they do so . 
  as to their debt-gdp ratio , this is a result not of increased borrowing - borrowings have stayed largely stagnant over the last few years - but rather as a result of their gdp dropping . 
  no , neither . 
  yes . 
  romanians , for example , have no cause to hate ukip other than they 're anti eu ... 
  not when it 's used in comparison to the huge deficit they had five years ago , and how much their balance has changed since then . 
  there 's a difference between fiscal and primary surplus . 
  pragmatism does n't imply necessary evil , it implies finding the best solution amongst currently available options , one that 's workable and generally requires compromise . 
   you understand the degree of debt greece currently owes , right ? 
  there is no possible way greece can procure a surplus that will service their current debt . 
  if they can get a 4 % primary surplus in the next two years , they 're going to be a year or two away tops from posting a fiscal surplus . 
  eh , it seems to be a common thing with newspapers to focus on domestic people . 
  when the flight over ukraine was shot down , australian headlines focussed on the number of australians that were killed . 
  i honestly ca n't think of anything that might piss golden dawn off more . 
   as opposed to your current economic policies . 
  pragmatic ? 
  so your only plan is to rely on the charity of other european nations ? 
  one which would never pass most parliaments ? 
  i wish the world were as utopian as you presume , but that was n't going to happen at the height of the crisis , and it 's not going to happen now . 
   what ? 
  exactly what i said . 
  a fiscal surplus means they 're able to service their debt and work on reducing it . 
  tell me again where greece would have gotten money for deficit spending . 
  that 's what i asked you . 
   greece 's current crisis is a debt sustainability crisis . 
  the fact that they have a debt to gdp ratio of 175.1 % negates the benefits of any primary surplus . 
  once they have a fiscal surplus , their debt will be sustainable . 
  then their debt to gdp ratio is irrelevant . 
  austerity is n't a policy , it 's a series of policies aimed at lowering public spending to sustainable levels . 
  and it was a marked success , because greece went from posting 15 % + deficits , to posting primary surplus ' .
