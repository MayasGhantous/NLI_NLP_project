  no one cries about how it 's undemocratic for an mp to introduce a bill that no one was aware was up for consideration in the first place . 
  well , it means that investors have to be compensated when a government expropriates their assets , yeah . 
  i do n't see what 's so controversial about that though . 
  the guy * literally * asked about my academic qualifications . 
  that 's why i brought it up . 
  because he wrote it all in a series of edits after i 'd already replied . 
   why do n't you address the anti democratic criticisms ? 
  fine . 
  present them coherently , and i 'll do my best . 
  not just `` it 's undemocratic '' , but why you think it is , what you think the alternative should be , and why the alternative will be better . 
  i 'll do it when you post a selfie with your face visible and your national id card and details there as well . 
  i mean , i wo n't because it 's stupid to dox yourself , but whatever . 
  you 're entitled to your feelings . 
   do you even think about what you write ? 
  yes . 
  i wrote my masters thesis on the topic , i 've thought extremely much about the topic . 
  you want me to * cite * my masters thesis ? 
  he disagrees with my opinion , he must be a paid shill !, 
  such a shitty thought terminating cliche . 
  now you 're basically saying `` we should live in a utopia ''  do you have any kind of academic qualifications ? 
  it 's a mathematical discussion relying on very specific premises . 
  yes . 
  i wrote my masters thesis on international trade negotiation . 
  it 's also not an economic theory  like most economic theory , it has very little to do with reality . 
  this is simply incorrect . 
  edit : dude , do n't edit your post after someone 's replied to it - it 's incredibly dishonest . 
  all there was when i first replied was what i quoted , now you 've extended it instead of adding it to another reply . 
  ttip does n't allow state assets to be sold , governments are already free to do that . 
  nothing under ttip will make it easier for them to do so . 
  you 're mistaken , i 'm just gon na quote the text i posted elsewhere ; actually , all international negotiations are conducted in secret , and for very good reason . 
  the core of why can best be described by robert putnam 's two level game theory . 
  2lg is pretty much the authoritative theory on success in international negotiation . 
  as you can see from a quick google scholar search , the theory has been cited in academic works [ over six thousand times ] ( http://scholar.google.pl/scholar?q=diplomacy+and+domestic+politics%3a+the+logic+of+two-level+games&amp;btng=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2c5 ) , so it 's not some crack-pot minor theory no one has ever heard of . 
  for those that are curious , there 's a link to it [ here ] ( http://portal.uam.es/portal/page/portal/uam_organizativo/departamentos/cienciapoliticarelacionesinternacionales/personal/fernando_rodrigo/pagina_personal_fernando_rodrigo/teoria_relaciones_inter/textos/putnam-%20the%20logic%20of%20two-level%20games.pdf ) if you 'd like to give it a more thorough browse . 
  it will provide a much more and precise explanation than the one that i hope to give , and it 's only thirty pages so it 's not very long . 
  i very much recommend all of you read it . 
  what 2lg essentially stipulates is that there are two levels of playing field in international negotiation ; the domestic , and the international . 
  in the domestic playing field , groups are formed to apply pressure on the government to adopt favourable policies ( these groups may be anything , from companies and ngos , to public or party opinion - the important thing is not to just consider them to be organized , clearly delineated groups ) , whilst politicians seek to get the power to push the agreement through by building consensus amongst the groups . 
  the international playing field , however , is where the national governments want to alleviate their domestic constituents concerns , whilst at the same time ensuring that the development of the policies of other parties in the negotiation does not adversely affect their constituencies and power bases . 
  one of the clearest ways to represent this is through ` win-sets ' . 
  a win-set is the full spectrum of acceptable outcomes to the party in question . 
  thus , in a two level game , the possible win-set for the international negotiation is in large part dependant on the range of acceptable outcomes in the level 2 negotiation ; that is , the larger each of the negotiating parties level 2 win-set is , the more likely they 'll overlap with the other parties in a place where both sides are satisfied with an agreement . 
  perhaps the best way for you guys to visualize it is through a [ venn diagram ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/venn_a_intersect_b.svg/1280px-venn_a_intersect_b.svg.png ) , except imagine that there are 12 actors and they all have to overlap in one spot for the tpp , or * 30 * actors for ttip . 
  now , the reason the negotiations are conducted in secret is to keep each of these venn diagram bubble countries as large as possible . 
  each time one of their possible negotiating is constrained , they get smaller , and thus less likely to overlap with all of the 11 other actors potentially leading to deadlock or abandonment of the agreement . 
  this can be especially troubling if the negotiations were done in public , with every individual , every company , every lobbyist , knowing at each stage what is being discussed and what has been provisionally agreed to . 
  thus , for negotiations to be successful win-sets need to be maximized , which means minimizing the influence of vested interests during the negotiation process . 
  imagine the following scenario . 
  the party governing a country gets a lot of its funding from a certain demographic , say dairy farmers . 
  dairy farmers have access to the text , and see there 's something they do n't like there . 
  maybe dairy tariffs will be lowered . 
  maybe their export subsidies will be cancelled . 
  maybe they 'll lose protected designation of origin status . 
  whatever , they do n't like it . 
  so the dairy union lobby launches a massive advertising campaign trying to scare the shit out of joe public about the new treaty , whilst simultaneously threatening the ruling party about how they 're going to fund the opposition if this goes through . 
  so , ruling party of course says that that clause can no longer be part of the treaty . 
  except imagine this multiplied amongst every industry sector of every country negotiating . 
  it 'd be an absolute clusterfuck , twelve countries all drawing red-lines over certain issues would lead to a treaty with absolutely zero teeth , and everyone would wonder what the fuss was about because it would really amount to nothing . 
  and i 'd also like to preempt the comments of `` but the corporations are already heavily involved '' . 
  those are n't corporations that are hammering out the deals . 
  what actually happens it that a number of different industry specialists are part of consultative groups ( for example one on agriculture , one on chemicals , one on pharmaceuticals ) , as are consumer rights groups , environmental groups , and others . 
  there 's nothing clandestine or shady about it , but if you 're coming up with a deal that 's going to change tens of billions of dollars in trade , then you definitely want to get a sense of how it would effect various stakeholders , and those stakeholders give input on those elements of a treaty . 
  joe citizen generally does n't have the knowledge , nor the expertise , nor the specialization , to be able to have a meaningful input into how a given provision would affect environmental standards , or consumer standards , or the steel industry , or the chemical industry . 
  but just as representatives of key sectors are given some access , so too are environmental groups ( under the tepac ) , labour groups ( under the lac ) , consumer groups , etc. 
  they 're all under strict ndas and security clearances . 
  if they talk to people about it , they 're going to prison for a long time , as well as paying a huge fine . 
  it makes sense to have representatives of those most affected taking part . 
  it 's also worth keeping in mind that negotiators negotiate with * what is politically possible to pass in mind * . 
  the job of negotiators is n't just to come up with an agreement , but an agreement that should be politically passable by all the negotiating members . 
  this means that the us has to be sensitive of both what is possible in the us , but also in the eu and vice-versa . 
  acta was shot down by the european parliament thanks to public opposition , do you think they would n't also shoot down ttip if they felt the same ? 
  and congress on it 's own is a whole other ball-park of trying to get things through . 
  arguments against secrecy in international negotiations come from ignorance and nowhere else . 
  there is certainly scope for more transparency in some areas - for example the eu has released the negotiating mandate , idealized forms of final chapters , etc which the us has n't done . 
  but expecting to see the state of the negotiations at every step is simply ridiculous . 
  see my response [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4elcpt/germanys_greens_sue_eu_for_lack_of_transparency/d21d73e ) .
