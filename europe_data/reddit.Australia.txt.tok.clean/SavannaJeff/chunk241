  i 've seen even comparations to isis in berliner zeitung . 
  hardly better than the kind of stuff you get from [ wprost ] ( http://s.redefine.pl/dcs/o2/redefine/cp/5i/5imp68a2fx8kjbskxoppysiktotf5t8m.png ) . 
  newspapers got ta act like newspapers . 
  wake me up when someone * important * is saying the same thing . 
  what credible individual is equating the polish people with nazis , communists , or russians ? 
  they 're concerned about polish democracy , because the story of poland post-soviet era with moves towards liberal democracy were an inspiration to europe . 
  now it 's in the process of being partially dismantled by a bunch of old school nationalist conservatives that think that only their version of what poland is is correct , and everyone else is a traitor that does n't love their country enough . 
  seems bizarre . 
  `` how dare you criticize us , regardless of how well founded it is ! '', 
  you 're playing into pis ' whole nationalism angle . 
  it was joke, 
  should n't have gotten rid of berlusconi , i guess !, 
  the entire front page was filled with ` here is our navy ' posts . 
  it was too much . 
  i was one of the proponents of a megathread for the refugees . 
  there 's no longer a megathread . 
  i lost , i 'm allowed to be bitter . 
  ca n't you guys just have a megathread for this ship shit ? 
   omg no , that 's censorship  why are you lefties always trying to silence genuine criticism !, 
  it 's an important european issue , it deserves to cover the front page !, 
   i do n't want none of them foreign ships coming to europe , they 're not even warships , they 're just cargo ships trying to make a quick buck !, 
  the cfp is constantly undergoing reform , and with more weight from members like norway and iceland that should only be sped up . 
  how have they been making partisan rulings ? 
  the us recently lossed the dolphin-safe case , they lost the cotton brazil case ... 
  the wto is n't a partisan organization as an institution . 
  thing is , the uk does n't really have anything that aussies want anymore , and with how you guys have been clamping down on aussies being able to come over , things are n't as warm as they used to be . 
  that 's really not true . 
  neither the eu nor the us can afford to drop the benefits of the wto , and the world benefits massively from the wto - hence why even russia and china have joined in the last few years . 
  i 'm a legal migrant who has been living in europe for years and i do n't have this concern at all . 
  and not even in places like africa , [ poland got 1.5 % of its gdp in 2011 from remittances ] ( http://www.case-research.eu/sites/default/files/publications/2012-12_barbone.pdf ) . 
   the un already works with the camps in turkey , they could use this to distribute refugees to un members based on a simply population size * gpd key . 
  except the un does n't have that power . 
  the nation states have that power , and they 're refusing to do any more than the refugee convention . 
  i do n't think repealing the refugee convention without setting up something in its stead is a very responsible course of action . 
   but then again we allow countries like saudi arabia to refuse taking any refugees because `` they dont fit their culture '' while we have to feel guilty for only taking 1,5 million of them . 
  well , if you want to always drop to the lowest common moral denominator , let 's just be like north korea !, 
  well , it 's not that easy . 
  it 's not as if refugees can just line up somewhere and be assigned a destination , while the bombs are falling . 
  again , we 're not . 
  they land , they can request asylum ( in which case they have their passport , and can be easily processed ) , or they 're refused at the border and have to be flown back . 
  repealing hat directive does n't stop them checking passports . 
  cheers !, 
  i 'll take polite disagreement over people rudely in agreement any day !, 
  no , legally you 're an asylum seeker until you 're granted refugee status . 
  you may get refugee status after passing through several ` safe ' countries ' , if in the eu you may get relocated to the first country of entry for processing , or if you 're deemed not a refugee you , in theory , should get deported . 
  it does n't always work out that way because - hey - life is complex , it 's not so easy to definitively state which country someone is from . 
  which is why repealing the eu directive in the linked video is such a good idea , because then at least they 'd be arriving on their passports and they could be processed much quicker on whether they 're genuine refugees or not . 
  wait , am i the silly naive socialist in this case , or the cryptofascist ? 
  i hear so much of both , it 's hard to tell !, 
   that seems reasonable , by definition they stop being refugees once they leave the first safe country in no way is this `` by definition '' . 
  look through the refugee convention , such a clause * simply does n't exist * . 
  people get this concept mixed up with the dublin regulations , which * only applies to eu countries * , and in no way states that those that move past the ` first safe ' country are no longer refugees - just that refugees should be processed in the country of entry to the eu . 
  secondly , it is eu countries that have made it so difficult for refugees to fly directly to a european country . 
  great short video by dr hans rosling [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo0irsfrpq4 ) . 
  ( only ~ 3min ), 
  very familiar . 
  i wrote my masters thesis on trade negotiation and covered isds intensely during studies . 
  i know it nowhere near as bad as popular media makes it out to be . 
  why do you think it 's not in europe 's public interest ? 
  how , on earth , is the ttip treason ? 
  i do n't see how him contributing to the disorder is helping maintain order there . 
  you 're the one that 's praising him , please explain it to me . 
  his interests are in a country not governed by the rule of law ? 
  both are independent . 
  the difference is that one is about as apolitical as you can get with an economic think tank , whilst the other has a clear political bias . 
  well , it 's not pure speculation . 
  it 's the best estimate economics can provide for various scenarios . 
  the journalists explicitly stated that they were the most optimistic in the way they phrased it . 
   a study by the centre for economic policy research ( cepr ) estimated the ** potential ** gains for the eu ** as up to ** $ 119bn ( # 91.5 bn ; $ 133bn ) a year and $ 95bn for the us . 
  what numbers would you give ? 
  hang on , the cepr also give lower band numbers as well , that is non-ambitious . 
  it 's not the fault of the report that politicians only bandy about the most optimistic figures . 
  anyway , as i already mentioned , even the article is n't claiming that this is how it * will * be , rather that this is the most optimistic scenario . 
  how politicians abuse the report does n't bear any relevance on its credibility . 
  the link you fixed is also only really attacking how politicians use the report , and not the report itself . 
  page does not exist . 
  anyway , they rather explicitly stated in the article that that 's just what the report states as * potential * gains * up to * . 
  if i were writing a journalistic piece on ttip , i 'd want to cite the most credible estimation of the benefits , and nothing as far as ttip is concerned is as credible as the cepr ( eu ) report . 
  because there are two , the centre for economic policy research ( europe ) and centre for economic ** and ** policy research ( us ) . 
  the former is staffed by the foremost economic academics in the eu from prestigious universities like the lce and is financed principally by central banks and is rather depoliticized , whilst the latter is just one of those left leaning anti-trade think tanks and is not really taken seriously by mainstream academics - i mean they 're rather vocal about their support for a lot of venezuelas policies , and that country is imploding . 
  the ceprs ( eu ) numbers most certainly have * not * been debunked . 
  it 's a bit hard to debunk their numbers without targeting their methodology at the moment , which is rock solid , as the agreement is n't even out yet . 
   as i said there many financially troubled nations or just small ones , but hey , they and the people living there do not matter , no ? 
  there are n't any nations that small in the tpp or ttip . 
  i definitely have strong reservations with hugely asymmetrical economic relations . 
   yeah , i gave you one . 
  you said it 's fair , i say it is not . 
  not only because i disagree with the decision , but because they are fundamentally anti-democratic and thus anti-freedom . 
  this is an argument against all international agreements , not just against isds . 
  fundamentally isolationist . 
   if you want more , i thik this should have you covered . 
  feel free to go wild there . 
  who the fuck is that ? 
   besides , investing in something always carries a risk , socializing that risk is anti-free market . 
  the whole `` unattractive to investor '' thing can be solved by free market principles . 
  see , if a country screws over investors , they become unattractive to future investors and also sour the relations with the investors home nation . 
  this of course benefits nations who do not screw over investors . 
  of course a few investors may get burned , but so do i when i put money in stock and the stock tanks unexpectedly . 
  i see you 're a person that does n't value a strong rule of law , where the tyranny of the majority can discriminate against foreigners , and where political parties can dole out favours to domestic industry at the expense of foreigners and democracy in general . 
   because europe is full of corrupt courts that are do are not obligated to hold everyone equal before the law , right ?
