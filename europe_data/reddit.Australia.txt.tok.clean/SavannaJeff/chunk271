  so what you 're saying is `` even if you live in a totalitarian dictatorship , if your family has had members tortured and arrested on dubious grounds , dont even thinking about leaving unless you want to be like one of us . 
  but when you get here , because of your darker skin and accent , you wo n't get any decent jobs and your family will pretty much be condemned to live in slums ' . 
  ` lovekrove ' in the jewish quarter for polish-style gourmet burgers ( way better than it sounds ) , alchemia ( also jewish quarter ) because it 's pretty much an institution now , but often has great live music and a cool atmosphere . 
  if you want a more complete list , send me a pm , but it 's the kind of city where almost any cafe or bar you go to has an awesome unique atmosphere . 
  it 's a rare choice , but tallinn in estonia is awesome . 
  i love estonians , the city is a very cool relaxed placed , and it 's easy to get there by ferry if you end up in helsinki or stockholm . 
  also , make sure to put a little bit extra aside for the sweden trip because , as with norway and denmark , it 's fucking expensive !, 
  capital syndrome . 
  everyone not from the capital hates the capital . 
  that said , remember it was bombed to skull-blistering butt-fuck during the second world war and hence does n't have the same ` flavour ' as a lot of other polish cities . 
  krakow is fan-fucking-tastic . 
  as a world traveler , it 's one of my favourite cities ever . 
  it 's a religion and a quasi-ethnicity , no ? 
  you know what , fuck it . 
  because you 've annoyed me so much , i tracked down where the cap budget for wine goes . 
  in 2011 , about one third of the budget went on the permanent abandonment of wine crops in certain areas ( ie : making is so that in the future the sector requires less money ) , the ` grubbing-up ' scheme , ( ie : restructuring the agricultural sector to make it more efficient by replacing non productive wine crops with other productive agriculture ) the other two thirds went overwhelmingly on this income support that i was talking about ( and one of the links i shared with you in the past demonstrated that non-commercial farmers tend to earn quite a bit below average wage ) source : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/budget/data/d2011/en/sec03.pdf, 
  just as a warning , the submitter has an agenda . 
  they 've admitted in the past that they 're national socialists of the nazi kind . 
  you do n't actually read what i write , do you ? 
  regardless , i 'm done . 
  arguing with you is , for me , like arguing with a brick wall . 
  no , the eurostat report says that 4.8 % of the total agricultural output comes from wine , not that 4.8 % of the cap is spent on wine . 
   that is odd , because i can go in and look at what the swedish government spends , and they spend more , in much more money , in much more detail . 
  if 2 % of the swedish gdp goes anywhere , you can be bloody sure we can have a look at it . 
  a budget without transparency , is corrupt . 
  the link i gave showed that not more than 0.2 % of the eus budgets gets wasted on fraud ( which is unsurprising given that countries like bulgaria and romania are still not westernized with respect to societal reactions to fraud so the few areas where they have competencies likely skew the number as a result ) . 
  this also addresses your point about corruption , eu institutions have less fraud than the individual countries of the eu put together on average !, 
  this benefits all of europe in the long run , just as the cohesion funds benefit all of europe in the long run as well . 
   i still are not seeing the links to why 44 % have to go to the cap ? 
  why do i have to pay so much more for food , while simoultaneously cutting down on research . 
  would 44 % of one euro be too much for you as well ? 
  it 's not the percentage , it 's the absolute value . 
  now , consider this ; the us spends [ $ 151 billion ] ( http://www.obpa.usda.gov/budsum/fy13budsum.pdf ) on its agriculture policy , for the size of japan 's agricultural sector , it also spends a good deal more than the eu , australia spent [ $ 1.6 billion ] ( http://www.daff.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/1907590/2011-12budget.pdf ) despite being 25 times smaller in population simply put , the eu spends equal to or less than what other first world countries do !, 
  and you still want to cut it !, 
   links please , as a swede i am fascinated how they are doing the research around the northern european forest industry , and the northern european agriculture . 
  i said when . 
  link is fixed , you still have n't given me a decent link for the wine . 
  the first link you gave ( the eurostat report ) didnt mention what you were talking about , and the second one was from an unrelated and unsourced blog . 
  as i explained , the water thing was an example of the kind of environmental sustainability financing the eu gives with regards to wine , not that that is everything that it is spent on . 
  as to your other points , reread the thread again . 
  i also addressed the corruption issue with a source . 
  edit for link fixing and for some more ( though slightly simplistic ) explanation , please refer [ here ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11216061 ) . 
  it 's a bbc article that shows both sides of the argument , i find the ones in favour far more persuasive than those against . 
   you still have n't given me a source for that is how the wine money is spent . 
  give me a source please . 
  i 'd since that would be very relevant since you are saying that 2 % of the eu budget is going to environmental adjustement of wine yards . 
  because there are only two major things that the cap budget can be spent on really when it comes to farming ; income support for farmers to ensure that in years of low market prices due to international factors they do n't go bankrupt , and for environmental sustainability . 
  i ca n't give you a source because it 's not as simple as looking at a source , it 's in essence the entirety of the cap . 
   it is not justified to the level that we are subsidising , and it is not an argument that it ca n't be done on a national level . 
  are you claiming that we need to subsidise it with $ 3/day to stabilise them ? 
  i do not think we need to pay that amount of money the amount of money that goes into the cap is the amount it needs to ensure agricultural worker income stability , food price stability , food security and environmental sustainability . 
   i sent you the eurostat report . 
  i object to around 40 % of the eu budget is going to cap . 
  i think it could be done better on a national level , and less corrupt . 
  also , i do not think the farmers need that much . 
  you know where percentages of the cap go to , you have n't demonstrated any knowledge of knowing the criteria for why it 's spent the way it is . 
  all you seem to know is ` this percentage goes here ' , and not why . 
  until you know why , i think it 's ridiculous for you to criticize it . 
   also , you have n't addressed the fact that the eu is harming 3rd world farmers with it subsidies . 
  i already said that i know that it 's harming third world farmers with it 's subsidies elsewhere , but that 's a silly point . 
  we live in a realist dominated international world . 
  the eus cap can at least to a high degree ensure that the food we get does n't significantly harm the environment , which ca n't be also said for third world countries . 
   of course . 
  link [ 1 ] . 
  another link [ 2 ] . 
  they mention the corruption that you do not believe exist either , but really , i can just throw link after link at you about the corruption in the eu . 
  here are some : link [ 3 ] . 
  here is my favourite , a minister 's daughter , a swedish accordian club etc. 
  this is when investigating journalism actually checked where the money was going ... ... link 1 [ 4 ] . 
  link 2 [ 5 ] - here it is also mentioned that some countries ( willfully i suppose because it is not really hard ) do n't release the numbers in accessible ways . 
  link 3 [ 6 ] . 
  this is actually an article of eu dealing with it , but the numbers they get back are very small , i just thought i wanted to prove that it was officially recognised byt the eu that it is corruption , since you do seem to believe that . 
  those kinds of errors turn up in any kind of government funded project , it 's silly to single out just the cap for that happening . 
   so , how do you suggest dealing with the corruption ? 
  do you think it is wise keeping something that is obvious corrupt ? 
  it have n't been dealt with in the last 16 years , so it is not like one can say that the eu is working on it http://ec.europa.eu/budget/explained/myths/myths_en.cfm#4of15  for example , since northern europe will be getting more and more rain ( i study environmental science ) it is strange that 2 % of the whole eu budget should go to how to deal with arid areas in wine yards ( which you claim ) , but not a lot on how to deal with the more rains we will get . 
  ffs , how many times do i have to explain this to you ? 
  that was an example of what it goes on , once there is a need to address environmental sustainability with regards to higher levels of rain due to global warming the cap will address that as well . 
  we 've discussed the cap issue before and why your clam of 2 % to wine was flawed ( not to mention that one of the two sources you linked to regarding that had nothing to do with it , whilst the other was from an anti-eu blogger ) . 
  the cap is a far better alternative than having national control over agriculture because it prevents the kind of competition that would lead to spiralling agricultural subsidization that would make things worse for everyone . 
  read through that thread again , every one of your points was refuted . 
  edit for those curious about the discussion , key points are [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12lkq7/the_european_parliament_will_block_david_camerons/c6w6zn8?context=3 ) , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12lkq7/the_european_parliament_will_block_david_camerons/c6we948?context=3 ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12h1j6/eu_budget_plans_for_2013_infographic/c6v9ptr ), 
  russia wo n't be integrated into the eu in the next 100 years at least . 
  a lot longer properly . 
  i do n't really thing your nationality has much to do with it , unless you 're from asia . 
  uat2d does n't really read articles , they just comment on them without thinking . 
  i have explained in a number of areas in this thread , feel free to read through . 
  the eu made the commitment at , if i recall correctly , the wtos 6th ministerial conference . 
  if you think about it , export subsidies are wholly out of line with what the caps goal is , which is food security , rural management , stable food prices and agricultural worker income , and environmental protection . 
  the wto agreement on agriculture barely touches on export subsidies in any significant way , but yes they do fall under the cap . 
  right , and i replied earlier that the eu had committed itself to removing export subsidies by 2013 . 
  i know that they harm developing countries interests , but that 's more because it means the eu does n't import developing countries agricultural produce as much as it otherwise would , rather than because it fuels european agricultural exports . 
  how do you think the subsidies fuel exports to lesser developed countries ? 
  they 're not based on production , but rather on land held and ` set aside ' ( ie , non-productive land ) . 
  the point of them is to stabilize agricultural workers income , provide food security if there is trouble internationally , and a number of other reasons that i 'm not going to get into now . 
  regardless , for many family owned farms , they 're one of the few things keeping those european families afloat . 
  export subsidies are also going to be phased out by 2013 , and there are no longer any huge ` surpluses ' occurring thanks to the cap for a number of years now . 
  australia has the second lowest producer subsidy estimate in the world ( after new zealand ) , but we have a strong comparative advantage thanks to geographic and historical reasons .

  secondly , in addition to the agricultural sector being added to the unemployment pool , you also get a shitload of ancillary job losses ( from rural towns and so forth ) .
