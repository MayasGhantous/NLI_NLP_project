  right , that 's my point . 
  they were bought on the secondary market , it 's not as if the ecb said ` hey greece , we 'll buy your bonds at a 30 % discount ' . 
   the bank of france will hand over 754 million euros ( $ 944 million ) of interest collected on greek government bonds it holds ** as part of agreements ** to offer the country financial support . 
  there is no reason why the ecb should voluntarily take a haircut now as they have no agreement to such a measure . 
  do you really think this is how such institutions work ? 
  german , british and finnish papers would be decrying the act instantly , and would create a fuckload more trouble in the long run than if it were an intergovernmental deal , rather than a supranational one . 
  as far as the ecb is concerned , this is a eurozone problem , not necessarily an eu problem , and that 's why it needs the concerted action of the heads of states to approve of something like this . 
  i explain why they have to ask full price back [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/xg3xd/greece_must_repay_a_32_billion_euro_bond_on/c5m94p2 ), 
  a lot of people here do n't seem to understand how this works , so i 'll try and cover it for you . 
  greece issues bonds to investors saying `` give me this much money , youll get so and so percent interest and then the lump sum back on the maturation date '' . 
  some people get scared that greece is going to default , so they sell the issued bonds on the * secondary market * . 
  the ecb apparently bought these bonds on the secondary market at a 30 % discount of the maturation amount . 
  greece still has to repay the original amount . 
  why ? 
  well , if greece were to repay only what the ecb paid for it , financial markets would be screaming ` default ' and chaos would erupt everywhere . 
  why would the ecb buy it ? 
  well , because frankly the ecb knew they were going to keep funding greece until the maturation date so they could ` make ' money on the deal . 
  it 's better that it goes to the ecb than to investors ( for the sake of the eu ) , as now the ecb has extra funds to help cover southern debt cheaply whilst the investors would have either fled the market entirely or gone for another high interest rate bond issue continuing the problem . . 
  it bought them at a discount , ** on the secondary market ** meaning from people that had already bought the bonds . 
  people sold them for cheap because they were worried about a default . 
  they bought it for 30 % less than the maturation price because people were worried about a default ( as you said , this was on the secondary market ) , so they were selling for cheaper than the maturation . 
  there 's no story here , it 's just how bonds work ... 
  mine was the reply to the north and south ez , i just put it there to give context . 
  ( and the whole conversation , do n't worry - it 's short ) . 
  you want a possible direction for the euro ? 
  [ here 's ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/wpdtb/germanys_hanswerner_sinn_is_fighting_desperately/c5fhaox?context=3 ) a quick and easy one in this threat that 0i wrote up in a few minutes a week ago . 
  but that 's not helpful because the posters on here ca n't give you the definitive plan that you seem to be looking for , any plan proposed on here will always be lacking in some aspect or not fleshed out enough . 
  sorry , that 's just the way it is . 
  i 've had the exact same thoughts as you regarding norrsken . 
  i 'm almost half convinced she 's a very intelligent troll ... 
  great post , agree 100 % !, 
  ( would still be a great post if i did n't agree ), 
  influence peddling . 
  poland supports american interests in the eu and the region . 
  oh c'mon , txampion is one of the biggest trolls on reddit . 
  he 's in almost every thread on this dubreddit , and always saying shit like that . 
  he even posted a manifesto where he explains his trolling and so forth . 
  i do n't like you anymore . 
  i. . . did n't say it did ? 
  i was accusing specofdust of the same hyperbole he said was in the article . 
  yeah , but specofdust read ` financial disaster ' and ` faded military force ' and decided that what the washington post was saying is ` economic disaster ' and ` decimated military forces ' . 
  financial does not equal economic . 
  faded does not mean very bad . 
  i like you . 
  c'mon , you get crazies everywhere !, 
  i ' l just sort by `` most recomm ... '' . 
  this is kind of the plan that i came up with an outlined in the comments [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/wpdtb/germanys_hanswerner_sinn_is_fighting_desperately/c5fhaox?context=3 ) it 's basically your plan , but i extended it to euro-wide commissions on efficiencies in government departments to remove waste and promote structural reform as opposed to just frantic budget cutting . 
  it also serves as a kind of new proto-eu integration treaty . 
  please in future state which one . 
  there are two pretty famous clinton 's you know , and they both do stuff like this . 
  the imf finds more benefit in aiding a one trillion dollar economy than a twenty billion dollar one . 
  yes , which is n't something that 's wrong with multiculturalism , but more to do with that faults of european integration policy . 
  funny , it seems to work well in the us , in canada , in australia , in new zealand , and regardless of this news story , pretty well in the uk . 
  what 's so bad about your country that makes it not work ? 
  edit : oh , you 're a troll . 
  i upvoted you , but i felt that did n't properly convey the strength with which i agreed with you so i 'm adding this comment . 
  i would add that krakow is still worth a visit if you 're there with locals . 
  amazingly fun and atmospheric city, 
  i was in tallinn a month ago , foreigners everywhere ... 
  i think he 'd have the best luck in latvia of the three for off the beaten path . 
  hello !, 
  please refer to my comments here on why i think you 're wrong http://www.reddit.com/r/economics/comments/wpdtb/germanys_hanswerner_sinn_is_fighting_desperately/c5fhaox, 
  sandomierz in poland is a beautiful city with an amazing old town . 
  very few foreigners even know of the place , i 'm not sure the menus are even in english . 
  yes , that 's exactly it . 
  you 've seen right through me . 
  we should stop upvoting or downvoting txampion full stop , otherwise he 'll never go away . 
  christ , you 're a fucking moron . 
  right , but the eu only has a few limited areas of responsibility that do n't correlate at all to what the op is referring to . 
  the eu does n't have enough power for the kinds of things you 're talking about . 
  it 's still far more intergovernmental than supranational . 
  i just wikipedia 'd it , it does n't say anything about a polish guy writing the japanese national anthem ... 
  i assume you 're referring to the length ? 
  is there not even a little bit more information you can give ? 
  can you please elaborate on this japanese like of poland ? 
  i 've never heard it before . 
  government bonds you buy at a set interest rate , giving you an expected rate of return . 
  stocks fluctuate in value based on many factors , but particularly market sentiment in whether the company ( or in this imaginary scenario , the country ) is having better than average expected long term performance , this is a pretty crude explanation , but it 's the best i 'm able to give in this sleep deprived state . 
  does n't work like that . 
  well done lithuania !, 
  true , but the point is that a significant portion of those currently living experienced soviet rule , not to mention the huge number of native russian speakers ( no idea if they self identify as russians or not ) living there as a result of the russification attempts . 
  yes , it 's in the public discourse in estonia , just as it 's recently started being in scottish public discourse . 
  culturally speaking , i 'm not so sure . 
  yeah , they have a very similar language to finnish but we ca n't forget that just like the rest of eastern europe they were under soviet domination for quite some time , and those scars still have n't healed yet . 
  they were at least fortunate enough that they got finnish tv channels during the cold war though which gave them some serious western influences , as i was taught on jaanipaev . 
  the commentator stated at the start that he was using eastern europe as ex-communist states . 
  anyway , i 've always preferred [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/grossgliederung_europas-en.svg ) definition . 
  the baltics are an iffy case , but if they 're so desperate to be north then i 'm sure we can accommodate them . 
  cheers !, 
  are these the same protests where people were launching fireworks at the police ? 
  i wish english had good proverbs like that . 
  this is the * europe * subreddit , we only speak english here , 
  well then we 're not disagreeing with eachother , except that i do n't believe that western pressure has anything to do with bettering the situation ( quite the opposite in fact ) , but rather an increase in living standards ( towards parity with the west ) and better education . 
  when i studied in krakow , older people were racist and homophobic as shit , people around my age back then ( early 20s ) were the same as you 'd find anywhere in the west or in australia . 
  it 's more than that , it 's a general attitude amongst people in the west . 
  if they hear gypsy or roma , they think dirty , thief , outcast , et cetera . 
  it might not be through overt actions of government that this discrimination is shown , but through attitudes and comments that the average person makes . 
  secondly , there were sources more than just the sun quotes in that article . 
  many more than just the sun .
