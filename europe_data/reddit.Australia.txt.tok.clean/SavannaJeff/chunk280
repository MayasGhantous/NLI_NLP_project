  i like you , please post more often . 
  i was speaking about hitchens in general , this is on topic . 
  and still my point stands , it is not religion but ignorance that causes these problems . 
  ignorance of the troubles facing others , or what they actually stand for , or just how similar we all damn well are . 
  and by enlightened i mean `` not ignorant '' . 
  it is funny , i say that hitchens is being ignorant by using historical examples from hundreds of years ago in his criticisms of religion today and you counter by saying `` but religious people do it too ! '' . 
  i propose that that anyone doing this is a fool . 
  you have also still not explained why you think that events in the past can be used against religion today . 
  many countries have also done terrible things in the past , does that mean they are also bad today ? 
  `` if you tell me in the balkans what your religion is , i can tell you what your nationality is . '', 
  this is true to an extent , however hitchens is still confusing the symptom of a number of the worlds problems ( such as in this case religious extremism , religious isolationism and religious bigotry ) with the cause ( ignorance ) . 
  an enlightened religious man is no bigot , an ignorant religious man is . 
  this statement is also true if you remove the word ` religious ' entirely . 
  the problem with hitchens is that he so often draws on the past to explain why religion is a bad thing , however if we were to draw on other ideals they also show deep flaws under closer historical scrutiny . 
  the past is a good way to draw context on an issue , however to treat horrific events coming from the 17th century as being relevant ** today ** proving why religion is a detrimental force to civilization ** today ** is folly . 
  as always , hitchens just uses a bunch of generalizations and anecdotes . 
  he 'd rather treat a symptom than a cause . 
  good on them , i wish them luck . 
  try krakow in poland , meant to be the new prague . 
  although really man , if you 're just going for a month your visits to all these cities will be pretty superficial, 
  care to elaborate ? 
  this does n't really give me an informed opinion . 
  thanks , this was very informative !, 
  your headline is stupid , the eu ca n't strip the uk of bank regulation powers . 
  anyone that believe this clearly has no idea what they 're talking about . 
  if you did n't already know , the economist group is one of the most informative and intelligent ` news ' groups out there . 
  you can get a free one month subscription to european voice no strings attached . 
  i half suspect if no one mentioned the words `` euro crisis '' the problem would be only 10 % as bad as it is now . 
  when the truefinns have the same experience in government that the danish people 's party has , you guys will be doing the same . 
  disclaimer ; i 'm a colonial . 
  it seems that everywhere i read anything about the uk and europe , it 's always brits saying how much they hate it and how they should n't have joined . 
  usually there 's also something about how much ` europe ' sucks in there ( despite the fact that we consider the uk to be part of europe ? ) . 
  just wanted to get an understanding of what the go is here . 
  cheers !, 
  realize it 's not exactly the most exciting topic , but thought it was the best place to ask  thanks !, 
  thoughts ? 
  i thought keller was pretty terrible most of the time , juncker barely had any presence , schulz was fun and intelligent , but a bit childish ( and perhaps megalomanic ) especially when he started interrupting and arguing with the hosts , whilst verhofstadt was the clear leader who was the one that put forth the most concrete and reasonable proposals ... 
  but i guess i 'm biased like that . 
  i recall a year or two ago this sub was inundated with articles about the situation in greece , lots of arguing about what was going on , how dire things were getting , etc , and since then they seem to have dropped away completely . 
  i was just wondering if anyone could give us an update on the current situation , things like if it 's improving for the man on the ground , what the political situation is , and so forth . 
  ** introduction ** there have been a number of posts on the ttip over the last few weeks in / r/europe , and i 'm kind of surprised by the misconceptions and outright paranoia so many people seem to have on the subject , in particular with respect to that of the actual negotiation phase of the agreement . 
  i thought this post might give people something to think about with respect to the negotiations surrounding the ttip in particular , and the agreement in general . 
  ** ratifying treaties ** let 's start with what it would take for the ttip to go into force . 
  once final agreement has been reached in the negotiations , it does not immediately go into force . 
  rather , it has to also be ratified meaning that it has to be put into the official body of law . 
  for this to happen , it has to be approved by the european parliament , and since this agreement falls under eu law as a shared competence , it also has to be ratified by all twenty-eight states of the eu ( simplistically , being passed in the legislative bodies of each of the countries ) . 
  that 's just on europe 's side , the us also has to ratify it requiring a two thirds majority of senators . 
  so right there , you have 29 countries plus the european parliament that have to ratify the treaty , as well as weeks with which you and the media can scrutinize the text of the treaty and determine whether you think it should or should n't happen . 
  as you can see , that 's a lot of different parties that have to find common agreement with eachother , as well as that agreement having to be broadly acceptable to the public . 
  and this is where the beauty of putnam 's two-level game theory ( `` 2lg '' from here on out ) comes in . 
  ** two-level game theory , and why negotiations should be secret ** 2lg is pretty much the authoritative theory on success in international negotiation . 
  as you can see from a quick google scholar search , the theory has been cited in academic works [ over six thousand times ] ( http://scholar.google.pl/scholar?q=diplomacy+and+domestic+politics%3a+the+logic+of+two-level+games&amp;btng=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2c5 ) , so it 's not some crack-pot minor theory no one has ever heard of . 
  for those that are curious , there 's a link to it [ here ] ( http://portal.uam.es/portal/page/portal/uam_organizativo/departamentos/cienciapoliticarelacionesinternacionales/personal/fernando_rodrigo/pagina_personal_fernando_rodrigo/teoria_relaciones_inter/textos/putnam-%20the%20logic%20of%20two-level%20games.pdf ) if you 'd like to give it a more thorough browse . 
  it will provide a much more and precise explanation than the one that i hope to give , and it 's only thirty pages so it 's not very long . 
  i very much recommend all of you read it . 
  what 2lg essentially stipulates is that there are two levels of playing field in international negotiation ; the domestic , and the international . 
  in the domestic playing field , groups are formed to apply pressure on the government to adopt favourable policies ( these groups may be anything , from companies and ngos , to public or party opinion - the important thing is not to just consider them to be organized , clearly delineated groups ) , whilst politicians seek to get the power to push the agreement through by building consensus amongst the groups . 
  the international playing field , however , is where the national governments want to alleviate their domestic constituents concerns , whilst at the same time ensuring that the development of the policies of other parties in the negotiation does not adversely affect their constituencies and power bases . 
  one of the clearest ways to represent this is through ` win-sets ' . 
  a win-set is the full spectrum of acceptable outcomes to the party in question . 
  thus , in a two level game , the possible win-set for the international negotiation is in large part dependant on the range of acceptable outcomes in the level 2 negotiation ; that is , the larger each of the negotiating parties level 2 win-set is , the more likely they 'll overlap with the other parties in a place where both sides are satisfied with an agreement . 
  perhaps the best way for you guys to visualize it is through a [ venn diagram ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6d/venn_a_intersect_b.svg/1280px-venn_a_intersect_b.svg.png ) , except imagine that there are 30 actors and they all have to overlap in one spot . 
  now , the reason the negotiations are conducted in secret is to keep each of these venn diagram bubble countries as large as possible . 
  each time one of their possible negotiating is constrained , they get smaller , and thus less likely to overlap with all of the 29 other actors potentially leading to deadlock or abandonment of the agreement . 
  this can be especially troubling if the negotiations were done in public , with every individual , every company , every lobbyist , knowing at each stage what is being discussed and what has been provisionally agreed to . 
  you can see where the trouble comes in now , right ? 
  the negotiations are progressing and the negotiating parties have just hammered out a deal of lowering dairy tariffs . 
  except the venn dairy lobbying company has been paying careful attention and is worried about its bottom line . 
  it 's extremely influential in one of the countries , so it lobbies the ruling coalition saying that if they agree to this agreement , they 're going to fund the opposition/pull out of the country leaving it with 20 % unemployment/what-have-you and all of a sudden the ruling party of one of the countries is feeling massive pressure to oppose this part of the agreement . 
  if this country says no , it 's over for the entire agreement and so that part of the agreement is wiped off . 
  now picture this in every country , across every single industry sector . 
  it quickly becomes obvious that this will either end in a deadlock and the breakdown of talks , or a treaty with so little oomph in it that it 's hardly worth the bother . 
  secretive talks mean we can avoid that , and putnam gives the example of the 1978 bonn summit as an example where the leaders came up with an agreement that was great for each of their countries and the world economy in tandem , but impossible to propose domestically on a unilateral basis due to strong opposition . 
  ** lobbying ** `` but !, 
  '' , some of you may exclaim , `` what about those nefarious lobbyists ? 
  they already have their hands all over this agreement ! '' . 
  i do n't doubt that lobbyists have some influence on the agreement , in fact that 's even taken as a given in 2lg . 
  but public opinion is implicitly considered as well ( after all , our politicians want to get reelected ) , and furthermore i 'd ask you to really think about how lobbying works . 
  i get the feeling many of you seem to think ` lobbyists ' talk to ` government ' and then lobbyists get what they want , without really thinking about how that happens . 
  who meets who ? 
  how much time do they have to discuss things ? 
  what do they discuss ? 
  how likely is it that negotiators will agree with lobbyists ? 
  do you think that the trade commissioner has time to speak to the thousands of different lobby groups vying for influence and take in all their input ? 
  that the government would allow companies into such sensitive talks so as to be able to see the current state of negotiations ? 
  companies undoubtedly know some aspects of the treaty we do n't know , and this is completely pragmatic and reasonable , but it 's not beyond some largely general knowledge about their sector . 
  they do n't know every detail of the negotiations , but in consultative meetings the negotiators will explain what they 're trying to get out of a position , what their plans are for that industry , and ask what the industry would like to get out of the negotiations . 
  this makes sense , if you have a $ 100 billion dollar industry then they 're the ones that are best going to know how the negotiations will affect them , and the economy , and ultimately the consumers and the people that work for them . 
  and yes , they 'll probably overemphasize the dangers to themselves and the opportunities abroad , but that 's a given in government work , as anyone that 's ever been in procurement knows . 
  ** isds ** a lot of people worry about the isds and how much power it has . 
  the thing is , they greatly over-inflate what it can do and where it 's applicable . 
  i 'd like to remind people that isds disputes are pretty rare ( there are isds provisions in some 3000 + trade and investment agreements and only a few hundred isds disputes in history , despite them existing for well over three decades ) , and that european companies make use of them more than any other country on the planet . 
  they 're there to remedy acts considered to be done by a government in bad faith against the aggrieved party , such as unfairly favouring domestic companies or expropriating assets . 
  the key term there is ` bad faith ' . 
  if there 's a reasonable level of scientific evidence that a chemical causes cancer , it 's fine to ban it and your country wo n't get sued , but if it 's just a knee-jerk reaction by politicians to protect domestic industry , then you can see why investors would want assurances . 
  this kind of ` gray area ' protectionism is extremely common between the eu and the us , as i 've written about [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z ) ** other thoughts ** many people here seem to take their worst fears about what might be in the treaty and assume that 's going to be the case . 
  this kind of fear based reactionism is simply irrational and unhelpful , and is constantly stirred up by newspaper articles because they know that fear sells . 
  if you 're concerned about some aspect you think might be in the treaty , write to your mps and meps ( they 'll be voting on it in parliament later on after all ) , and to the eu about your concerns but do n't start with some bullshit about how they should n't do the deal . 
  that is , unless you hate globalization/the eu/the us/your mother/whatever in which case feel free , but you 'll be mostly ignored as a nut case .
