  once an agreement in the negotiations is reached , then is the time to start criticizing it . 
  but at the moment , many of you are just imposing your worst fears about what might be in there and saying that they should scrap the agreement because of that . 
  ** disclaimer : ** i 'm a shill , as demonstrated by the fine investigative work of the gentlemen [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2en4m9/italy_wants_euus_trade_talks_made_public_the/ck1qixe ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2e9796/wheres_the_outrage_over_the_transatlantic_trade/cjxfurf?context=1 ) . 
  but beyond being a clandestine agent for the us government , these are just my opinions and i 'm unaffiliated with any government or lobbying company . 
  my interest in this is purely personal . 
  edit : fixed venn diagrams , thanks bezbojnicul, 
  so back in february 2014 , the swiss had a referendum on implementing quotas for immigrants that passed at 50.3 % - 49.7 % . 
  there were a bunch of articles coming out at the time about how the result put in jeopardy a number of eu-swiss bilateral agreements . 
  has there been much of a change since ? 
  how is swiss discourse on the matter ? 
  and of course , associated questions !, 
  thanks !, 
  [ removed ], 
  are n't the new mods meant to be announced today ? 
  denmark is in the euro zone ? 
  the danish kroner i 've been hoarding are wasted !, 
  so have you finally admitted to being an out-and-out neonazi yet ? 
  i 'm just tired of you guys jumping from / r/european to other submissions and infesting the place with your filth . 
  if you guys stayed in / r/european , instead of avoiding bans and shit , i 'd be perfectly content . 
  yes , 2 hours after this is submitted to / r/european , some 5 / r/european regulars who have never posted here before come in and they 're not brigading . 
  you 've never posted in here before , but you post in / r/european . 
  i have n't reported this to the admins , but i 'm tempted to if you keep this lying bullshit up . 
  / u/ramblinrambo3 should know better after being shadowbanned . 
  if he 's not gon na stop this brigading shit , he can live with the consequences . 
  it 's amusing watching you guys brigade this thread from / r/european . 
  you know that shit is against reddit 's rules , and can get you banned from the site , right ? 
  and / r/european shut down ? 
  just sayin ' . 
  yep . 
  / r/europeans is for long and in depth articles , / r/european is for neonazis . 
  yes , shareholding is a risk , but it 's not gambling and anyone that cares about their retirement would have a portion of their savings in it . 
  this is what most retirement funds are , vast portfolios of shares and bonds . 
   you could make the same argument whenever some kind of tax is raised in any kind of industry . 
  no , you could n't because raising tax equally for an entire industry sector is n't discriminatory , hence it is n't actionable under isds . 
   but that is hardly the case here , it is merely a side effect of a potentially poor decision . 
  that does n't mean the company ( and through them , the shareholders ) does n't deserve compensation from the german government wiping out a portion of their savings . 
  a company is a collection of people - it 's shareholders . 
  when the government discriminates against vattenfall , it is discriminating against everyone that holds shares in vattenfall , from rich guys that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars , to mum & dad traders , to people 's retirement share portfolios . 
  all those people had part of their wealth wiped away due to the german governments decision , and the isds case is what will bring it back . 
  at it 's most simplistic , the german decision was stealing from all of those people . 
   what is possible with the isds can be seen in germany quite well : vattenfall is suing the government for 4.7 billion $ because of the nuclear phase-out and apparently their chances are quite good . 
  regardless of what you think about the decision personally , it was a political one based on popular opinion , without intent to harm the company . 
  it is was a risk for vattenfall all along , considering germany always had a strong anti-nuclear movement . 
  see , i strongly disagree with your interpretation here . 
  germany had the shut down following fukushima to run safety checks , and the comprehensive reports that followed did n't recommend shutting down the nuclear power plants . 
  yes , nuclear power was unpopular in germany prior to this , so merkel 's shut down was , as you said , a political decision . 
  but should we really punish groups due to political decisions ? 
  we live in liberal-democracies , that prevent instances of the tyranny of the majority and mob rule . 
  there should be a non-arbitrary reason if they 're going to discriminate against them ( which is what they did ) , beyond just listening to the wishes of the mob , such as recommendations from structural nuclear engineers or some such . 
  well that 's where the ` unfairly ' part comes from . 
  it 's fine to make a law that only harms foreign companies provided that the country is n't doing it * just * to harm those companies . 
  the company is n't going to win an isds case if it tries to sue , so you would still have the option to implement the laws . 
  isds is just a bit of extra security for the investor so they * do n't * get screwed over when governments unfairly make laws , because it 's actually a surprisingly common occurrence . 
  i 'm not trying to be an arse here , just curious ; you really think it 's ok to treat foreign companies - that employ local workers , pay local taxes , and work under local conditions - unfairly to give domestic companies an advantage ? 
  domestic companies which are probably also owned by various types of foreigners , just as people from your country probably own parts of foreign companies in their retirement share portfolios ? 
  wow , german media is really so one sided on the issue ? 
  on the subject of standards : the director of dg trade ( the body responsible for negotiating ttip ) has already stated that they 're not going to lower eu standards as a result . 
  [ link to interview ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sections/trade-society/commission-official-eu-not-going-change-its-food-legislation-because-ttip#.vhqw3url5sq.reddit ) . 
  furthermore , the eu has also state that they 're [ not going to change `` existing levels of protection ( consumer , environmental , health , etc ) for the sake of an agreement '' ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/questions-and-answers/ ) . 
  as to the isds provisions ( ability for companies to sue governments ) , they ca n't sue for ` lost revenue ' . 
  they can sue for unfair expropriation of assets ( nationalizing a company without giving fair compensation ) , or for making laws that , in bad faith , target foreign companies , or for making laws that unfairly favour domestic companies in favour of foreign . 
  i wrote a post about how isds ( the mechanism by which companies can sue governments ) is actually used [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clervs2 ) . 
  finally , most independent studies by credible organizations do find that there are benefits from the ttip , most notably the cepr report , a report done by probably the most respected economic think tank in europe . 
  the cepr report found that some half million jobs in the eu would be displaced , but that this would be mostly due to pull factors ( ie , people changing jobs due to better conditions or pay ) , and that there would be increases in eu gdp as a result . 
  of course , this cepr report was speculation based on what they expect the outcome to be , so should be taken with a grain of salt , but by far most analyses do not show ` next to no benefit [ from ] the fta ' . 
  if a vegan is n't militant about it , i see no reason to make fun of them . 
  if they are then sure , i 'll give them shit . 
  you do n't have enough cities in the east , which is the much more fun and interesting part of europe . 
  i 'd avoid most of those capitals as well , unless there 's something you absolutely want to see . 
  capitals tend to be very overpriced and disappointing experiences . 
  you need a month for the balkans alone , let alone the rest . 
  it depends on what you like doing !, 
  since you 're still a relatively young guy , perhaps you like partying ? 
  in that case , head south east !, 
  cities like krakow , prague , budapest are beautiful cities that are cheap with lots of friendly people and are super fun over all !, 
  like going to museums and such ? 
  head south west , to france and italy !, 
  do n't like trying new things ? 
  go to skane !, 
  it 's practically denmark already !, 
  take with you ; clothes , possibly small towel , money , and a positive attitude . 
  lyon is in france , but you might replace it and head to marseilles since it 's on the coast and they may have diving . 
  if you dont want to go to vienna vienna , you could go to bratislava which is a very short distance from vienna and which is quite pretty as well , or krakow . 
  i 'm only saying this because i 've met a number of germans that had this view , but ` eastern ' europe is n't a terrible , ugly , poor place . 
  many of the cities are very beautiful these days , they tend to be cheaper , and in my opinion more fun . 
  otherwise , i would say that / u/knoflookperser 's plan is an awesome one , one i 'd happily go on if i were living in germany and wanted to do interrail . 
  and you just completely misconstrued most of the points i made , but whatever . 
  people are free to read through them and realise you 're a nut . 
  read them again , carefully . 
  i 'm not saying it 's a certainty , i 'm saying it 's a widespread tendency , and certainly a much stronger such sentiment than you 'd get in anglo countries . 
  my other foreigner friends , all highly educated , have the same view . 
  i have heard swedes say that , hence why i wrote it ,, 
  again , not all the things i write about sweden are negative . 
  the person i first replied to in this thread was listing negative things , so i contributed my experiences . 
  however , as i said , i also stated it was a great country and that i would like to live there after i turned 35 and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2cjn1s/need_assistance_in_looking_for_education_in_europe/cjgcqyg ) i also post good things about sweden . 
  perhaps if you were not so defensive at the slightest criticism you would realise that . 
  given i have you tagged as xenophobic , it 's hardly a surprise that our world views do n't match . 
  your inability to see that foreigners may have a different take and different eperiences on sweden just reinforces that view . 
  i 've written many good things about sweden too ( i even write in the post you were replying to that i recognize it for the great country it is !! ) . 
  and there was more than one study , and they were n't just arabic names .
