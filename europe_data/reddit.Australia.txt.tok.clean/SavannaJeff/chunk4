  again , an arbitrary one which you picked for no practical reason . 
  why puberty ? 
  any kind of measurable reason , or just one that you , and i 'll say it again , `` make [ ... ] up whenever [ you ] want to suit [ your ] preconceived notions ? '', 
  yes , but you also want to limit certain groups being able to lobby . 
  that 's what i take issue with . 
  so you 're saying there 's not really a boundary , people just arbitrarily make one up whenever they want to suit their preconceived notions ? 
  so you 're saying there 's an arbitrary cut off date for when someone can start being european despite not being born there ? 
  what 's the age ? 
  what 's the fundamental difference between one day before they can be european , and one day after they can no longer be european ? 
  yeah , the guy is just a dick . 
  i get what he 's trying to do , but it does n't stop him being a dick , or this being the wrong way to go about it . 
  it also means to deprive them of a right or a privileged , which i would say being allowed to form groups to lobby for your interests is one of . 
  and no , it would not be disenfranchising them . 
  democracy is n't just ` one vote every few years ' . 
  it 's an extremely complex , and often contrary system . 
  these people are n't disenfranchised because of corporations lobbying . 
  they 're apathetic because they do n't form groups to lobby the government . 
  democracy is n't just our system of government , or a right . 
  it 's a responsibility , and most people fail that responsibility by not caring enough . 
  they prefer to take the lazy option , of having people legislate who can have access , rather than getting out there , writing letters to their mps , forming groups , and making their voices heard . 
  the fault is with the people , not with the lobbyists or politicians . 
  maybe when they show they give a shit , the politicians will start listening to them more than to companies . 
  my citizenship , my heritage , my languages , and my residence all seem to indicate that i 'm european . 
  is someone that 's born in australia under the same conditions as i , but moves to europe when they 're 5 years old european ? 
  my parents are european , my family has been european for centuries , and i have a european citizenship but i was born and raised in australia . 
  i know three european languages , and have lived for more than a year in each of three european countries . 
  i 've lived in europe for almost six years now , and intend to live the rest of my life here . 
  i 'm not european ? 
  i 've written a long response which i think covers all of that [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clervs2 ) . 
  you can still disagree with isds after reading it on other grounds , but please understand that there is no clause about ` negatively impacting profits ' or some such . 
  c'mon mate , i 've pretty definitively disproven a bunch of times that it 's never about ` muh profits ' on here , and i 'm quite certain you 've read those discussions as well . . 
  a company is just a bunch of people as well , it 's shareholders . 
  when a company is lobbying , it 's doing it on their behalf . 
  you want to disenfranchise those people , just because you do n't like what they ask for in a democratic society ? 
  lobbying is amoral , it does n't have to be beneficial to the greater public . 
  it 's simply a way for a group of people to express their views . 
  ` expats ' is the term for rich , western , immigrants , whilst ` immigrants ' is the term for those that come from poorer countries . 
  that was n't a reasonable comment in the slightest , it was a series of unqualified eurosceptic talking points . 
  goddamn , do i love it when people actually post statistics and a source . 
  the cost of living tends to be significantly higher as well , so i do n't think they work out ahead at all . 
  you love foreigners there , but you have restrictions on the amount that can work there !, 
  at least in the uk ( the country that seems to complain about it the most ) , it 's not a problem except for a media manufactured one . 
  they did a study where they found that , on average , an eu migrant will pay more into the system than they 'll get . 
   who will bend ? 
  the eu and its nations i expect . 
  honestly , i do n't think that 's the case . 
  the eu frequently has trade disagreements with the us , taking them to the dispute settlement mechanism of the wto on numerous occasions . 
  they 're still bickering over hormone grown beef , a process which started years ago . 
  given the above , i see no reason why the eu would cave in . 
  mate , that 's the tpp . 
  ttip is the one between the eu and the us . 
  what a nice sentiment . 
  well , it 's not as if they all live in 5 bedroom mcmansions there with strong building codes ... 
  i was n't dismissive or ignoring them , i 'd addressed them . 
  if you do n't have anything more substantive to say , we 're not going to get anywhere . 
  when i link you to a comment of mine that goes into some detail about an individual isds case , including references to the source documents , and explaining why it 's not just `` if they change environmental laws , they can get sued !, 
  '' , and you reply with a simplistic answer trying to tell me what isds is , that you have n't read it . 
  thanks !, 
  genius !, 
  that seems like a pretty good explanation , actually !, 
  they have n't finished negotiating , meaning the text has n't been released to the public yet . 
  but someone asked a similar question yesterday , and [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clerlxy ) was my response . 
  there are a lot of people on here that are young , and do n't understand nuance . 
  or that ` companies with huge amounts of money ' represent people as well , their shareholders . 
  cheers , yo !, 
  eh , if you 'd read what i written then you would n't have presented a simplistic and unnuanced view of ttip and isds . 
  shill : someone paid to promote an opinion/viewpoint/agenda / product online . 
  i feel i addressed this kind of stuff in the comments i linked , but since you 're on mobile maybe you did n't see them . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clervs2 ) why isds is generally nowhere near as bad as it 's reported , and why they do n't sue just because of environmental regulations/what have you . 
  honestly , i feel like you did n't read my posts since i answered why they 're in secret , and it 's not some kind of ` they want to screw the workers ' kind of deal . 
  eh , according to [ this ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/questions-and-answers/ ) from the ec , consumer standards are n't going to be lowered as a result of the ttip . 
  the second post i linked to of mine ( [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ewgn3/lets_have_a_discussion_about_the_ttip/ ) ) explained why they were negotiated in secret , but fundamentally i do n't see it that different to the concept of cabinet confidentiality that exists all over the eu as well . 
  and whilst it gives more ground in europe for american companies , it does the same in the us for european companies meaning situations like [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z ) are n't likely to happen again . 
   many of your responses to posters came down to `` we do n't know anything for sure yet , we should n't discuss speculations '' which i found rather ironic . 
  i would n't characterize that as what my replies were . 
  in general , i was trying to say `` we do n't know what 's in it yet , so let 's be sceptical of doomsday scenarios until we have concrete information . 
  do n't assume the doomsday scenario is going to be the final outcome , because it probably wo n't be '' . 
  but perhaps it comes off differently to everyone else . 
  my motives for writing on the ttip ? 
  sure . 
  i finished a 30 ects points masters level subject on international negotiation and then went on to do one of my masters theses was on trade negotiation during the doha development round . 
  since then , i 've kept a keen interest on large trade issues , such as this and the tpp . 
  i 've read through all the leaks of both trade deals , as well as a lot of secondary literature such as economic analyses of the prospects , and so on . 
  make no mistake , this is a topic of personal and academic interest for me , and what is reddit if not to have easy access to your interests and a forum to discuss them ? 
  so i come on to reddit and see a bunch of people posting ` but it 's going to lower our consumer standards ! ', 
  or ` it 's just a way to let american corporations take over europe ' or ` but they 're negotiating it in secret and that 's undemocratic ' and so on , and feel compelled to correct them . 
  it 's ridiculous because it does n't add anything to the discussion . 
  the chance of someone legitimately being a shill are next to non-existent , so all people are doing when they try that are to derail the discussion , or try and discount someones opinion because they ca n't / do n't want to argue against them themselves . 
  if everyone that had been accused of being a shill on reddit , actually was , it would be a trillion dollar industry . 
  accusations of shilling are as ridiculous as trusting random internet comments . 
  considerably more ridiculous even , i 'd say . 
  welp , better stop trusting every comment you read on the internet since apparently anyone could be a shill . 
  eh , i wrote about the ttip [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jsqfv/what_is_so_great_about_ttip/clerlxy ) and [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ewgn3/lets_have_a_discussion_about_the_ttip/ ) . 
  you can decide for yourself if it 's an abrasive opinion . 
  as i recall , did n't poland extradite someone to russia a few years ago , someone who came to give talks ? 
  during some big celebration or something ? 
  in the last few months i 've been accused of being a shill for america , for russia , for fracking , for nuclear , for renewables , for ` the corporations ' , and for illegal immigrants . 
  honestly , i do n't know where i find the time , and with so much money coming in from these shilling operations , i do n't know why i bother with some of them . 
  the word ( and accusations ) are meaningless , just a cheap way to try and delegitimize someones arguments . 
  the fact that you think i 'm an american shill makes you pretty worthy of the tin-hattery accusations , i must say .
