   you 're doing it again . 
  it fits . 
  you do n't want me pointing out the bigoted things other people say , even to the point of telling me i should keep my observations to myself , however you do n't tell the bigots that they should n't shut up . 
  it 's fine to let the bigots run rampant , but if you complain about them then you 're the bad guy . 
  if dealing with any other kind of polish bureaucracy is as bad as dealing with the deans office of a polish university , i can understand why so many people are fleeing the country . 
  i explained to you why those numbers are skewed through methodology . 
  if you do n't understand how that works , i 'm not going to explain it to you any further . 
  as to your second paragraph , i did n't do that here , you chose to come barging into this thread and starting this argument , derailing the thread that was underway . 
  i do n't randomly jump in and say ` ner , ner , you 're a racist ' for no reason . 
  i made two observations in two different threads , top level comments that were n't interrupting the flow of a different discussion and would better be described as metacomments . 
  ** you ** are the disruptive one here , not i. 
  if you do n't like it when i call that there are frequent stormfront brigades here ( i 've received threats from them a number of times , specifically identifying themselves as stormfront ) , if you do n't like it when i point out that most of the users commenting on a subject are those that have a virulent history of posting islamophobic or outright racist remarks , then tough - that 's your problem . 
  i have n't broken any rules , i have n't interrupted discussions or derailed topics - ** you 've done that ** . 
  i do n't know why you care so much , given you 've described yourself as a lurker that pretty much does n't contribute anything , unless you 're sensitive about possibly being called islamophobic in the future for the way you misrepresent and misuse statistics to show that muslims are bad . 
  how did i troll in this thread ? 
  i was following the same line of reasoning as the prior two posters were . 
  the only people that should 've felt compelled to respond were those that believed that you could be civilized and a bigot , and we could 've had a discussion from there . 
  do n't blame me because some people are hypersensitive to being called bigots . 
  if you think i should 've been banned , you should message the mods and give your reasoning . 
  i 'm not rambling about university and thesis ; i 'm explaining why you should not throw statistics you do n't know how to read around . 
  just as , because you 've read a wikipedia article on medicine , you 're not qualified to give medical advice then so too , as someone that does n't know how and why and what makes a good statistical analysis you should avoid throwing statistics around . 
  second , he did n't use as proof that ` he knew a few people ' , from the beginning he explained that the methodology in the statistics was worthless and why . 
  christ almighty , how about that the study assumed that everybody who was a descendant of an immigrant from a predominantly muslim country would be muslim ? 
  if someone were to use a methodology like that writing any kind of masters thesis at university they 'd be laughed right out of the thesis defense . 
  but again , it does n't matter . 
  you 're not educated in these areas , you do n't understand how or why you ca n't just throw statistics like that around , or why you should check the methodology of such statistics before you do so there 's no point continuing this conversation . 
  i 'm certainly not going to try and summarize a 6 month university course for you just for you to ignore it later . 
  and this is what i meant by people trained to read them . 
  / u/jebusgobson pointed out the glaring methodological flaws in the estimate you provided , yet you still to this day continue to use it as gospel . 
   wikipedia ( with a source to us gov website ) and international business times are far-right websites ? 
  in case you did n't notice ( probably not , because i highly doubt you 've done a methodological or statistical course in your life ) , i was talking in general terms about the use of statistics , and not of those statistics in particular . 
  well i 'm a firm believer that only those that have been trained to read statistics ( ie : those that have taken high level methodology/statistics courses ) should be allowed to use statistics . 
  in particular , they should examine the methodology of any statistics they post before doing so , as you did n't do in [ this exchange here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2aw2r8/antwerp_rally_calls_for_slaughter_of_jews/cizrzxf ) . 
  anyone can post statistics they 've read on a far-right or what have you website in support of their argument . 
  but there are lies , damn lies , and statistics , and so they should be avoided except by those that have a solid grounding in the subject . 
  it says that in the title . 
  eh , the processes involving creating solar and wind turbines in terms of different metals and plastics and so on are also very damaging with a lot of hazardous byproducts . 
  with nuclear power , at the least , there 's hope that 4th generation reactors will be able to significantly cut down that half life , as well as reuse spent fuel to a higher degree . 
  besides which , there are reclamation facilities where spent fuel rods can be sent to be reused although this is an expensive process . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not one of those gung-ho nuclearthorium-all-the-things-people . 
  but the arguments put forth against nuclear power by green groups are terribly short sighted ( aside from the obvious one ) and , well ... luddite . 
  admittedly , most of them probably did n't have an ex that was a nuclear engineer . 
  pah !, 
   yes , having actually lived in a western european city with a considerable muslim population i do have less romantic views about islam in general . 
  that being said you can always take out these `` disparaging generalizations '' and i 'll either admit i was wrong there or i 'll defend myself . 
  instead of accusing me of those generalizations like that . 
  well i 've lived in a northern european city , one that is frequently pointed to by the xenophobes and bigots as being * par excellence * for the failures of muslim integration . 
  you know what i found there ? 
  that all those accounts were massively , horribly exagerrated . 
  that malmo ( and rosengard in particular ) were n't warzones where non-muslims could n't enter . 
  that they were people just like you and me . 
  that they were friendly , immensely helpful ( one of them , an aquaintance of my ex , once drove me to the hospital on only the second time i 'd met him and waited around with me for the four hours i was there ) , and that they should in no way be judged by what a few dickheads do . 
  on top of that i 've worked for two years in a poor , recent immigrant , muslim dominated suburb in australia and there i also found most of them to be decent people . 
  not better or worse than the ` natives ' , just human . 
  so yes , sorry , i reject the selective use of statistics , rampant hyperbole and exaggeration , and coded language such as `` enjoy your diversity ! '', 
  as being the bigoted , xenophobic , and racist comments that they are by intolerant or ignorant people . 
  edit :  i 'm not talking about this submission only , i 'm talking about certain posts of yours in / r/europe [ 1 ] in general . 
  am i forbidden to do so ? 
  oh , so you 're allowed to comment on my posting habits over multiple submissions , but i 'm not allowed to make the same posts about theirs ? 
  excuse me , but none of those comments are in this submission and my comment was in the same vein as those that i was replying to . 
  the only one derailing here is you . 
  of course , if you 'd like to get into a discussion about constructive posts i can perhaps post to [ this one on the subject of eu-us trade relations ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ztbsz/the_french_train_company_sncf_has_been_told_it/cfwsy7z ) or [ this one on the subject of the cap ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1c736z/in_unusual_move_german_chancellor_has_invited_uk/c9drnm6 ) , [ this on russian energy in the eu market ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bfwcc/your_thoughts_on_european_energy_independence/cj4ys2b ) or [ this on the functioning of the eu ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/16zgox/im_a_eurosceptic_heres_why_i_will_be_voting_to/c80ta5z ) . 
  where have you contributed anything of comparable substance in / r/europe ? 
  the only longer posts of yours here are those relating to muslims and your disparaging generalizations about them . 
  i take it you 're a big fan of bitcoin ? 
  just ignore him , he 's either trolling or in desperate need of attention . 
  typical brit , make everything about yourselves , 
  nuclear power is green ... 
  no , print euros because inflation is at a dangerously low level ( bordering on deflation ) and it needs to be returned to what the ecb mandated target is , which is 2 % . 
  you were saying that the person should 've been arguing for egalitarianism ( from my reading of the situation ) rather than what they did say , when they said equal rights for women . 
  the point is a semantic one because they did argue for egalitarianism ( ie : women and men are equal ) , they just worded it poorly . 
   equal rights for women = women and men are equal . 
  is what the person said . 
  women and men are equal . 
  i do n't know why you 're trying to start a semantic argument where none need be had . 
  perhaps you 'd prefer to have this conversation in one of the askfeminists/askmra subreddits where they 're happy to argue over such matters , seeing you have your heart set on arguing over this topic . 
  i just quickly double checked this thread , and as far as i can tell ( though i am very tired so i might 've missed something ) , i have n't called anyone here racist . 
  you must be thinking about someone else . 
  what do you class as constructive ? 
  i think most of the hate piled onto muslims , immigrants , and gypsies in this subreddit is unconstructive , but please enlighten me as to how you 'd define constructive . 
  or civilized bigots . 
  have you ever read don quixote ? 
  particularly the part about windmills ? 
  kind of you to care !, 
  like i said , ' a man in the pub told me ' . 
  nst is the main malaysian newspaper . 
  they 're quoting global research 's release of a report , yes , but that report was written by a real journalist , [ robert parry ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_parry_ ( journalist ) ) edit : do n't know why i 'm being downvoted for clarifying , but ok . must be them kiev nazis i hear so much about . 
  actually , they quote globalresearch as releasing the report , but the report was written by an investigative journalist that actually has legitimately uncovered conspiracy theories such as in the iran-contra affair . 
  that said , having read his report , it 's just second hand information with no corroborating evidence , or any evidence that can actually be linked to . 
  until more comes out , this remains very much an ' a man in the pub told me ' situation . 
  because it 's second hand information from a non-mainstream news source that has n't been corroborated or verified . 
  great to hear !, 
  i was worried it might go the way of nabucco . 
  i 'm bitterly disappointed that 's not an actual subreddit . 
  except for the extrajudicial ones in northern ireland , i guess . 
  yeah , maybe 2 % do including those that did n't understand how to reference . 
  in poland , it is literally upwards of 50 % . 
  you have zero experience , yet you 're talking as if you 're an expert . 
  i went through two years of polish university culture , i think i know better than you . 
  yep , by all accounts it seems to have been successful in australia , so i do n't know why you would n't implement it elsewhere beyond bullshit libertarian ideology .
