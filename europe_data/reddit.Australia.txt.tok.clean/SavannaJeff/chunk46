  no one has suggested crippling the eu . 
  the current sanctions are mean to cost the eu 0.6 % of gdp growth next year , and there are a number of other policy mechanisms available to sanction russia which fall considerably far short of ` crippling ' the eu . 
  no one has suggested starting an all out war either . 
  i do n't see anyone suggesting this happens either ... you keep talking about starting a war , yet ** no one has suggested this ** . 
   they are vastly more competent in handling this than random people on the internet , who have no idea what 's actually going on really ? 
  the eu policy lead on dealing with russia is all coming from the uk , france , and germany - countries which did n't spend centures either under russian domination , or dealing with russia an existential threat . 
  the voices of those countries that do have russian experience - poland , estonia , lithuania , latvia , and hell , even pacifist sweden of all fucking countries ( yet which had to deal with russia for centuries historically ) , are universally calling for stronger measures . 
  these countries , which know what the fuck they 're talking about , are being ignored by the inexperienced and complacent west . 
  if ukraine had been a nato member , they could 've invoked article 4 . 
  the eu and us sanctions are supposed to cost russia 4.5 % of its gdp next year . 
  sanctions do n't phase russia . 
  sanctions are temporary . 
  if you really want to impose consequences , have a unified gas deal with russa instead of the current sea of island deals that exists . 
  that 'll show long term structural opposition to how russia acts , beyond being merely good policy . 
  i do n't know if sweden has the same method as dealing withy fires as australia , but some fifty years ago we 'd send firefighters out to deal with every single forest fire around . 
  this just allowed the flammable materials to build up on the forest floor and the fires would get worse and worse each year . 
  a few decades ago we had a shift , to where we 'd only protect property and people and otherwise let the fires burn as they wanted to , and they became considerably more manageable . 
  it 's also full of racists , xenophobic , and bigots . 
  i have n't notice your posts in / r/europe before , but i 'd * really * like you to stay . 
  the ` muslim ' violence in china is being presented as such by china because it fits their agenda and goals through the shanghai cooperation organisation . 
  in actuality , they 're nationalist separatists who are against the colonisation of their traditional lands , much as is happening in tibet . 
  educate yourself . 
  edit : downvote facts . 
  charming . 
  the bigots have already firmly entrenched themselves in this thread . 
  you forgot / r/european, 
  still here , still mostly the case . 
  does n't matter about residency , just that you have the passport . 
  i 'm surprised finland is n't considerably higher . 
  smart on the side of the russians , when it finally goes down it 'll just be another unauthorised entry until it isnt, 
  as an eu citizen , you can study for free in sweden . 
  i 've done this myself , beautiful place , great people , and quality education . 
  depends on which group he was fighting for . 
  freedom from independent thought ? 
  ehm , i 'm on my phone now , but eu conservative linked to it earlier . 
  because before this agreement comes into force , it has to pass through 29 national legislatures plus the eu . 
  this is just negotiations . 
  if there are egregious breaches of consumer rights , i expect at least one of the legislatures to be against . 
  most people against have zero understanding how or why the processes in those negotiations take place , some article or populist tells them to be against using fud so they are . 
  and they will know . 
  when the final negotiated document is put before the 29 different legislatures and the eu . 
  it 's not excluded from any decision . 
  public consultations are constantly held , and the finalized agreement will have to be out before the legislatures of each of the 29 countries and the eu , meaning ye public will have a chance to see the finalized proposal before it 's voted on . 
  it will increase opposition of vested interests who can bring their lobbies to bear and make agreement less likely . 
  ftas are negotiated in secret for a reason . 
  i do n't know why you say respectively , i was totally defending my sexual integrity . 
  the nexus of history and modern international politics sends my nether regions all aflutter, 
  ** do n't ** laugh on public transport or in public . 
  a few friends and i were riding a tram in krakow some years back , laughing ( not disruptively noisily or anything ) when an old grandma turned to us and said we were n't allowed to laugh because we were in a public place . 
  [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/u8qmh/i_made_a_european_version_of_those_american_pride/ ) ? 
  or [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/w2xdr/europe_hell_yeah/ ) ? 
  most do n't really give a shit , to be honest . 
  not enough to start a republicanism debate over it , anyway . 
  i 'm a great fan of [ this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1kcxc9/how_will_a_federal_europe_work/ ) , if only for the discussion between / u/bowgentle and / u/wobblewagon on the nature of how the lisbon and constitutional treaties were actually different beasts , and not the same thing as many eurosceptics claim . 
  another good discussion of his [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1m68u2/europeans_now_revive_europe_join_eunow/cc7gnw0 ) on the subject of referenda in the eu . 
  / u/bowgentle is one of my favourite posters , a really knowledgeable guy ( his stuff on ireland and the gfc is fantastic as well , albeit in / r/ireland ) . 
  normally the `` greece , pay your debts '' in every thread was annoying as buggery , but i recall there was one time that it was beyond hilarious . 
  alas , i ca n't recall the exact occasion . 
  do you mean [ this one ] ( http://snag.gy/opbvl.jpg )  he 's not sneaking it in . 
  it 's clear as day . 
  he means arabs and other forms of junk from the middle east pouring in to europe . 
  i saved it to reddit , so i can still see it despite it being deleted by the mods . 
  the most amusing thing is that he always claimed he was just quoting the other guy . 
  thanks bro !, 
  it 's a good one , although the argument was more about how to diplomatically deal with russia and how western europe had zero experience in that compared to eastern europe . 
  edit : unfortunately , i was travelling at the time so could n't continue the discussion . 
  yes it did, 
  this deserves more than an upvote , i love this . 
  dunno if you had it , but they have a type of vodka called orzechowka which tastes like nutella , with none of the burn or unpleasantness of lesser quality vodkas . 
  quite a dangerous drink . 
  yep . 
  the eu report on the conflict said that russia was correct to intervene , but that they also overplayed their hand . 
  so write that in comments when the west fucked up , it 's irrelevant to the discussion at hand . 
  if you 're a macho russian patriot that values strong leaders and militarism , the russian poster is very much a pro-russian propaganda poster whilst the eu one is anti-eu . 
  i do n't see what this has to do with anything . 
  depends on what your value are , i guess . 
  no one wants war to break out . 
  but a message needs to be sent to russia that it ca n't break international laws with impunity . 
  the zywiec porter is pretty renowned as the best of mainstream porters , let alone porters in general . 
  you have this annoying habit of editing your comments completely after i respond to them , so i have no interest in further discussion with you . 
  no , they keep it secret because almost every single treaty of such kind is negotiated in secret , to prevent vested interested interfering constantly . 
  if it were negotiated in public , vested interests of 29 different countries would be lobbying their government , saying ` if you do n't / do do this then we 'll fund the opposition ' across a wide variety of sectors , leading to deadlock because no one would be able to move . 
  this is international negotiation theory 101 stuff here . 
  it 's not some conspiracy , it 's just the least-bad way of doing it . 
  i 'd also thank you not to downvote me just because you disagree with the facts . 
  some form of isds is part of almost every one of the 3000 + free trade and investment treaties in force on the planet . 
  most people that read about it have some apocalyptic view of what it is which does n't in any way translate to reality . 
  you do n't know the phenomena of [ intermediate english ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncxrjype6jm ) ? 
  no , only the negotiating papers . 
  the actual ttip will have to be passed by each of the 28 national parliaments as well as in the eu , in which case it will be put before the public . 
  bloody brits , going to poland taking polish military work ... 
  yeah , i 've seen that and he moderator poorly worded it but clarified it further down the comment chain that the person had repeatedly broken the tules . 
  ramblinrambo conveniently edited that part out though . 
  they get banned for breaking rules , not for being racist . 
  if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck ... 
  yep . 
  they were sued because the quebec government released lots of land specifically for fracking which companies invested money into , and then with no warning imposed a populist ban on fracking . 
  with respect to racist , i 'd say more so . 
  i think you need to reread what i wrote . 
  i specifically did n't say it was ** because ** of poverty , but that factors associated with poverty led to that .
