  i mean , you 've never even tried to have a discussion with me , you just started accusing me of being a shill a few months ago because i 'm not rabidly against the ttip as you are . 
  edit : and to add , it 's so bizarre that people are upvoting someone that 's proposing that there 's a conspiracy orchestrated by the european commission against the european parliament so that they do n't see anti-ttip views on reddit ... 
  so you 'd rather listen to ignorant people 's rhetoric , rather than someone that links to respected sources , gives page numbers and quotes , and is actually educated on the topic ? 
  and i did n't just call them anti-trade and anti-globalist , i said that they were some of the possible reasons they would be against . 
  that is , if you 're referring to the post [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/britishpolitics/comments/2j3m7x/uk_government_to_sell_eurostar_stake_before/cl89lja?context=1 ) , and if not then i do n't know where you 're referring to . 
  hey , if you spent the better part of two years studying a topic academically , and then continued following developments on your own following that , then you 'd be commenting on such topics as well . 
  i do n't like the whole ` conspiratorial ' `` it 's just for the us corporations '' talk , when that 's clearly and evidently not the case . 
  so i speak out against it , rather than allowing the circlejerk to continue . 
  champion ? 
  the guy asked for the positives of the ttip . 
  i provided him with links to renowned and respected research institutes , provided page numbers for their findings , and presented them here . 
  did i do something wrong by this , or do you just jump around harassing people who have a different worldview to you ? 
  shilling , what an original accusation to make . 
  actually , based on what dg trade the the ec have said , it seems to be rather that the us will raise their standards towards european ones . 
  but we do n't know yet , so we 'll have to wait and see until a negotiated document is finished . 
  edit : link [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ttip/questions-and-answers/ ) which states that they 're not going to change existing european standards , and that there will be no race to the bottom . 
  yeah ? 
  who gives the people those options ? 
  how are those options determined ? 
  if the uk had direct democracy , there 'd be no taxes , free services , and public hanging for people that walk too slowly on the footpath . 
  i barely trust them to do that , but it 's better than direct democracy . 
  i do n't know about what they 've done in the past , but the canadian health and environmental departments both stated that their products were not dangerous as a fuel additive in this case , hence why they won . 
  i think you two are agreeing with eachother . 
  the eu already has [ isds provisions in over 1400 of their investment and trade agreements ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/march/tradoc_152279.pdf ) , and is the most prolific user of them globally . 
  regardless , isds is nowhere near as bad as commonly reported . 
  i 've written this elsewhere , but i figure it fits here as well . 
  most instances of isds are pretty reasonable , and even the phillip morris one has some backing ( tobacco company suing australia over plain packaging of cigarettes ) . 
  they 're not claiming lost profits or anything as the cause for the suing ( that 's what they want in damages ) , rather they claim that the government expropriated without compensation their intellectual property - their trademark , brand name , brand associated goodwill , etc. 
  i 'm sceptical they 'll win , but they have a case to make , and regardless i do n't think they even intend to win - rather , whilst australia is bogged down in negotiations , other countries will refrain from implementing plain packaging themselves ( ireland , for example , appears to be waiting on the verdict before implementing their version of the law ) . 
  they probably did some cost analysis which determined they 'd lose less money on lawyers ( and the settlement against them ) than they would if other countries implemented plain packaging sooner . 
  regardless , in most cases that isds is undertaken it 's not nearly as egregiously against the public interest as the philip morris case . 
  pretty much all successful isds cases are when the government takes political decisions which disproportionately disfavour foreign companies . 
  for example , an early use of isds was when canada banned a fuel additive that was only used by one company ( foreign ) called ethyl corp on the basis of health reasons . 
  ethyl corp sued , saying the additive was actually banned for political reasons rather than on any scientific grounds , and the canadian government settled paying them some $ 20 million dollars and withdrawing the law they were implementing . 
  on the face of it , it seems like ethyl corp was the bad guy and the canadian government was pursuing legitimate policy in the public interest . 
  in actual fact , [ ethyl corp presented the canadian governments own documents ] ( http://www.economia-snci.gob.mx/sic_php/pages/importa/sol_contro/consultoria/casos_canada/ethyl/971002_statement_of_claim.pdf ) ( p. 4 onwards ) , coming from the health and environmental departments , dating to about a year prior that unequivocally stated that there was absolutely zero danger from using the additive in fuel . 
  in fact , the party that tried to get the law through had had strong historical links with the domestic companies competing with ethyl corp. 
  in all the papers , it was portrayed as ` company sues government over environmental protections/health protections ' , and that 's how all isds cases get presented in mainstream newspapers . 
  ` company screwing with our laws ' sells way more papers than ` company disputes unfair government policies ' , i guess . 
  i do n't know about you , but i do n't think it 's fair that foreign investors should be unfairly discriminated against in this way . 
  isds prevents political parties from favouring their contributors over foreigners by enacting biased laws such as these . 
  why should joe public lose out because one of the parties is trying to cozy up to their largest donors , and why is it fair that international investors get screwed just because they 're foreigners ? 
  regardless , modern negotiators have recognized some of the flaws demonstrated by the phillip morris case , which is why the eu negotiations for the ttip have added to their [ negotiating mandate the following text ( on isds ) ] ( http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/st-11103-2013-dcl-1/en/pdf ) ( p. 8 )  and should be without prejudice to the right of the eu and the member states to adopt and enforce , in accordance with their respective competences , measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as social , environmental , security , stability of the financial system , public health and safety in a non-discriminatory manner so it 's not if they do n't get their way , it 's when government either expropriate their assets without fair compensation , or the government acts in a discriminatory fashion to foreign companies , or when the government acts ` in bad faith ' against a foreign company . 
  regardless , that only allows them to sue and does n't necessarily mean they 'll win , and they can only sue for money - they ca n't change laws or anything like that . 
  edit : grammar and adding a source, 
  and yet they ban minarets . 
  according to [ this paper ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/march/tradoc_150737.pdf ) commissioned by the ec done by the centre for economic policy research , one of the things it most clearly mentions is that between 0.2 % and 0.5 % of the eu 's labour force will change jobs due to ` pull factors ' ( that is , workers are incentivized to go into different jobs because of better conditions/pay/what-have-you ) , and gives the example of steel workers instead moving into auto-manufacturing , p. 96 . 
  they estimate on page 45 that there 'll be an increase of between 0.2 and 0.5 % of gdp for the eu and the us . 
  [ here 's an analysis of various models used to analyse the impact ] ( http://www.ceps.eu/book/impact-ttip-underlying-economic-model-and-comparisons ) aside from that , cheaper consumer goods , increased two-way trade , the global hegemonization of us-eu consumer standards ( other countries will adopt eu-us standards because it 'll be the largest market for them ) , more two-way investment , that 's the most readily available data i can offer at the moment . 
  what ` strings ' were you most concerned with ? 
  it 's still being negotiated , we do n't know the details of what will be inside so i 'm a bit uncertain of which strings you consider to be attached . 
  xenophobic petty thinking and infrastructure . 
  hey , as long as you 're descended from a hundred generations of swiss , it 's great !, 
  like banning minarets , and screwing up their treaties with the eu ? 
  hahahahaha . 
  / r/ukpolitics is leaking . 
  are you kidding ? 
  direct democracy would be a nightmare . 
  the average voter is [ wrong about almost everything ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-public-wrong-about-nearly-everything-survey-shows-8697821.html ) , they do n't care enough to inform themselves , and they 're easily swayed by a cheap suit and a charming smile . 
  just because you may be educated , does n't mean most are . 
  well , my work here is done . 
  you do n't have some secret knowledge no one else does . 
  you 're not smarter than everyone else for ` figuring it out ' . 
  there is no conspiracy here . 
  i knew i should 've invested in tin-foil a few years ago , the market for it has exploded lately !, 
  i 'm not subscribed to any of those . 
  does n't change that you 're quite mad . 
  you are quite mad . 
  they 're not fighting british soldiers . 
  european commission presidents are appointed by a qmv of the heads of state of the member states , whilst the european council president is done by just the heads of state of the member states . 
  you 're from the uk , you do n't get to elect your pm or your cabinet , unless you 're lucky enough to be in one of the electorates that has one of them standing there . 
  even so , you do n't actually vote for them to be a minister or the pm , they 're appointed as such by their own party . 
  if the eu has no democratic legitimacy through the way the european council and commission presidents are chosen , neither does the uk . 
  daily mail ... 
  those are the people that do n't plan to work outside the uk anyway . 
  the kind of ` fuck you , i got mine ' type . 
  it 's pretty good , but borgen is better . 
  they 're not in a military coalition against them ( i can only presume youve been playing too much eu4 ) , nor at war with them . 
  i did n't say they were n't in a conflict . 
  isil is not a recognized state , not is the uk at war with them or in a military coalition against them . 
  / u/trucidator is a lawyer , maybe he can shed some light . 
  whilst i deplore their acts , i do n't think they 're exactly treasonous . 
  not european , but the australian ( original ) version of ' ** rake ** ' is one of the best tv shows on the planet . 
  it 's about a lovable but sleazy lawyer trying to get his life together in the face of massive gambling debts , a broken family , and his chronic tax evasion whilst trying to win back the heart of a prostitute . 
  it 's a comedy , check it out if you care to . 
  features some great acting , especially from the lead actor and very talented richard roxburgh ( you 'd be surprised in how much he was in that you did n't know about ) , and features many internationally renowned australian guest stars , such as sam neill ( jurassic park ) , geoffrey rush ( the kings speech ) , and hugo weaving ( matrix , lord of the rings ) . 
  alternatively , there 's '' ** review , with myles barlow ** ' , a show where the host reviews anything , from revenge and stealing , to getting a divorce and starting a cult . 
  [ most episodes are on youtube ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1ellnqzomu ) . 
  also very funny , and was later remade for the american market . 
  you keep using these words , but as i 've demonstrated a number of times , you do n't know what they mean ... 
  on certain subjects , wikipedia is an * extremely * biased source of information . 
  remember , it 's edited only by those that have the interest in doing so , so those that are anti-immigrant would be far more likely to edit it than those that do n't give a shit . 
  i 'm as shocked as you are . 
  i can already tell this is going to have some fascinating comments . 
  yep , armchair generals love pointing out the flaws of the f-35 without recalling that most modern jet-fighters had similar teething problems . 
  until they begin putting them into active service , we ca n't really determine if they 're a failure and personally , i doubt that they are . 
  so what is the public supposed to base their opinions on , eh ? 
  just go with gut feeling , or what the media or politicians tell them to ? 
  i guess they should also ignore doctors opinion and treat themselves based off of yahoo answers as well ... 
  the torygraph will complain no matter what happens .
