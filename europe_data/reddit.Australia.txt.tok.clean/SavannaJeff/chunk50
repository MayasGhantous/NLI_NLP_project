  i do n't see why this is a stinging indictment on immigration in sweden . 
  there are limits on immigration ... as to rosengard , a shit load of that is exaggeration by racists on the internet . 
  my ex was from malmo ( where the suburb people always talk about , rosengard , is ) and i spent a shitload of time there over the year + i was with her . 
  had a bunch of friends there , many of who were the children of mena immigrants . 
  simply put , it 's a massive exaggeration . 
  even elsewhere in this submission there are a bunch of malmo natives that concur . 
  i think precisely because australian jewry is rather resistant to ` assimilation ' that they do n't view israel as a necessity . 
  regardless , even of those that do support the state of israel , the overwhelming majority are against settlements . 
  this is purely from my experiences mind you , perhaps i just used to have different social circles . 
  economic segregation is a ` choice ' ? 
  are poorer people with few social safety nets ( family , friends , etc ) more likely to commit crime ? 
  sure . 
  but the point in your quote you should be focussing on is this  immigrants were also three times more likely to be ** investigated ** for assault and five times more likely to be ** investigated ** for sex crimes . 
  regardless , i do n't see what your point is here , or behind your entire question . 
  because a tiny fraction of a minority population commits proportionally more crimes , we should n't allow any of them in ? 
  so flashback-lite ? 
  china , siberia ... neither involve europe . 
  lots of policies are promoted by their governments . 
  i do n't see why this is any different . 
  this sub is basically the best place on the internet for decent discussion on europe , i 've certainly learnt a lot here . 
  i do n't want the character of the place to change to one where it 's all just a circlejerk about how immigrants are the devil . 
  when you go into a topic and it 's nothing but racists spewing their garbage , it 's more likely to attract more of them . 
  plus i know most of these topics inside out , it only takes a minute or two to reply . 
  that was n't my experience with the melbourne jewish community . 
  it 's / r/europe - sponsored by stormfront . 
  yeah , that lovely guy advocates shooting refugees as a deterrent * ` for the greater good ' * . 
  / u/llanita does n't have a monopoly on ridiculousness , but she 's making a strong play regardless . 
  deusidies is a lying russia apologist . 
  nah mate , it 's baltic . 
  yep , i dated a girl in malmo for over a year and spent a lot of time there with her and her friends . 
  i 'm always amused how all the racists on reddit love to bring up malmo as an example of ` dem mooslems is just bad !, 
  ' , despite never having been there and probably not even being able to locate it on a map . 
  i loved the place . 
  there are also arguments beyond just monsanto . 
  jesus , i 'm personally not anti-gm , but the way you argue and your shitty points are just an embarrassment . 
  you know you can be anti-gmo for non-health reasons , right ? 
  it was n't acting provactively . 
  ukraine is a sovereign state that can make it 's own decisions , and if one of those decisions is to sign the association agreement then that is not the eu ` provoking ' russia . 
  this is an easy thing to say , but impossible to substantiate . 
  how do corporate lobbyists have exclusive access ? 
  what do they see , what can they do ? 
  or are they just invited to some aspects of the table because they know best what the effects of a change would be on their business employing tens of thousands of people across europe ? 
  it 's the kind of claim people make that sounds good , but there 's nothing really on the surface of it . 
  there 's no ban on criticism or information of said treaties , because they 're not complete yet . 
  they 're not treaties . 
  but there will be time for examination when it 's put before parliament , and also when they run the citizen consultation programs . 
  no one is forcing through secret documents , it 's just negotiations that are in secret . 
  pretty much all ftas and investment treaties are negotiated in secret , as are most other international treaties . 
  it 's to stop vested interested bogging down the process . 
  it makes sense if you 've spent any time at all studying international negotiation . 
  dumbarses . 
  execute tony abbott for treason , crimes against democracy , crimes against the rule of law , and crimes against humanity . 
  gas is n't typically used as energy in the same was as nuclear is . 
  britain is a small economy in comparison to the us . 
  the us economy is more than 7 times larger . 
  i do n't know the details of each and every single fta , what i do know is the literature surrounding ftas and that it points to a strong correlation between the size disparity between the two actors and the relative gains going to them . 
  both parties can win with trade , but ftas always end in a process of distributive bargaining once options for integrative bargaining are exhausted , meaning that whilst one party may benefit the other party can benefit substantially more . 
  and given that there 's generally only one shot at an fta ( that is , it 's difficult to renegotiate them later ) , it 's far better to be a large party and consistently get good outcomes , than be the small party and consistently get poorer outcomes . 
  those agreements have largely been to the benefit of the us , considerably more than the other countries . 
  it 's pretty much accepted doctrine that in trade negotiations , the larger partner tends to ` win ' . 
  you may literally be too stupid to argue with . 
  maybe if you did n't have a shitty attitude . 
  you mean locking up their leadership and a number of their members for committing and organizing murders ? 
  yeah , they did a good job . 
  jesus , are you too stupid to understand that antifa is a loose organization , and not an ideology ? 
  i 'm opposed to fascists as well , but i 'm not a member or supporter of antifa which is something else entirely - a bunch of thugs that use violence against anyone they consider to be a ` fascist ' , according to whatever far left definition of fascist they decide to use . 
  ah , you 're some form of idiotic far-left socialist/communist , right ? 
  your arguments are magnificent , i of course now agree with you . 
  after all , everyone knows that sweden , which has a strong antifa contingent that knifes ` fascists ' , is undemocratic and super capitalist friendly . 
  no , we should expect the established legal order to defend us and arrest those forces that go contrary to that ... 
  saved . 
  what a load of garbage . 
  it 's what happens when our politicians are happy to go on a populist spree ( `` you know what the difference is '' ) and our fourth estate gleefully stokes the fires of intolerance and bigotry . 
  they did n't have to ` track him down ' , that information is public in sweden . 
  and it did n't blow the door off it 's hinges , it damaged some of the paint ... 
  a few stabbings , intimidating people critical or immigration , and so on . 
  oh c'mon , bombing the politicians home makes it sounds more extreme than it was . 
  it was classified as ` endangering vandalism ' when they were investigating it , and not as a bomb attack . 
  by all accounts i 've seen it was a minor explosion more akin to firecrackers , and antifa was n't implicated in the attack . 
  do n't make connections that have n't been verified . 
  i 'm not well read up on the situation in greece , other than that large parts of their membership have been arrested for committing and planning murders . 
  by my reckoning , that 's an indication that vigilante actions are n't / were n't necessary even if golden dawn did have a high level of background support within the police force . 
  i do n't know about what it 's like now with their general membership , but if the police had n't stepped in when they had then i can see where some pre-emptive violence would have been justifiable given that the legal order would have been effectively broken . 
  do n't get me wrong , i have no problem with counter-protests provided they 're peaceful and legal . 
  i just do n't think that beating up/killing those that we disagree with is morally justifiable . 
  that 's a different thing entirely . 
  but that 's not the case in spain or most/all of the countries antifa operates and commits vigilante acts . 
  my arguments have almost always been legalistic in nature , and i strongly believe in and support democracy and the rule of law . 
  antifa often commits actions that go contrary to that . 
  hence , i dislike antifa . 
  i generally agree with your posts against racism , immigration , and so forth , both here and on / r/unitedkingdom , but in this case you come off as a bit of an extremist . 
  besides the point that stabbing people is morally reprehensible , some people just fall in with the wrong crowd because life pushed them there and they do n't know better . 
  they can ( and have been in the past ) redeemed . 
  so then you believe that those people that antifa deem to be fascist deserve to be stabbed ? 
  because this is how antifa ` defends democracy ' in sweden . 
  you ca n't defend democracy and the rule of law through vigilante actions , threats , intimidation , and so on . 
  antifa is pretty messed up though . 
  they 've been implicated in a bunch of actions ( including violent ) which go far beyond the scope of what 's healthy in a democracy . 
  dammit , dailymail warning . 
  you know rense is a website for conspiracy theorists , right ?
