  shoo , fly, 
  i think you missed the point . 
  im asking for a specific law you think is stupid , not something click-driven websites sensationalize as stupid . 
  how do they ignore them ? 
  i wouldnt say its the ` pro-eu ' side , but rather the status quo side, 
  what are the bad/stupid laws ? 
  a solid 60 % + is, 
  diamonds are a manufactured issue . 
  sonething like .02 % of diamonds are for ` social ' use , the rest are created in labs for industrial applications, 
  thr arctic sea is far more about shipping routes , than natural resources . 
  i find that unlikely . 
  there 's a massive underinvestment in o&g exploration in russia as it is , they do n't need crimea to get more . 
  exactly , so i wasnt sure where state equality lay in the equation for choosing the executive, 
  australia is a federation as well , however our executive is not chosen on a state basis , but by the party/coalition that gains a majority of seats in the house of reps. 
  it 's our senate that has equal votes for each state , and i see no reason why this system could n't work in the eu as well . 
  one house to represent the people , where government is formed , and one to represent the states . 
  truth out is a shitty source . 
  not necessarily . 
  i have more in common with a free market social liberal from estonia , than a conservative from poland ( where i 'm currently living ) . 
  people who care will vote for their politics , not their country . 
  i did n't say he was being warned for being racist . 
  and i see you conveniently ignores the second quote done by the moderator , where he quotes ramblinrambo saying he wants to shoot the boats ? 
  just because he tries to humanize his case later on , does n't mean he originally did n't advocate shooting them outright . 
  i made the picture to send it to the mods . 
  it was in my sent box . 
  but it 's funny after i even give you conclusive proof from a moderator warning and quoting him , that you still do n't believe that he said that . 
  it 's pretty definitive when in [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/27d8sh/merkel_blasts_unacceptable_attacks_on_britain/ci052e2 ) i quote a mod quoting you saying you want to shoot the boats . 
  in sum : you are a lying sack of fucking dog turd . 
  even [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25is4z/italy_demands_help_threatens_to_release_refugees/chhqutm ) in another one of his deleted comments ( although it 's quoted by the person underneath ) you can see he advocated * shooting them * , not * at them * . 
  he even pretty much explicitly states it 's ok in his next reply or [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25is4z/italy_demands_help_threatens_to_release_refugees/chibgbu ) where he got a fuckign warning from the moderator for what he was saying , who quotes / u/ramblinrambo saying he wanted the boats shot . 
  you are a lying fucking sack of shit . 
  in multiple of those deleted comments , you advocated shooting them , not at them . 
  in [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/smmjklk.jpg ) exchange , when i asked you if you would shoot unarmed men women and children , and you said yes . 
  i even specifically mentioned ` killing unarmed civilians ' . 
  and you 've said comments to that effect multiple times since then as well . 
  you can backpedal all you want , but you 're a violent , sociopathic , neonazi . 
  from one of his deleted [ comments ] ( http://i.imgur.com/smmjklk.jpg ) . 
  he advocated * shooting them * , not * at them * . 
  you see that ? 
  i asked if he would shoot them . 
  he said he would . 
   dude you 're so far on the left that it sickens most people . 
  this whole political correctness bs and calling people racist , storm front [ 1 ] , fascist thing you have going on is enough proof of that . 
  given how often i 've advocated free-market solutions and the like , i do n't see how that makes me a ` leftist ' . 
   i do think we should shoot at those boats to stop them from entering illegally . 
  you did n't say shoot at , in the past , you said shoot - as in shoot to kill . 
  do n't start backtracking now . 
  what federal system is being implemented ? 
  according to the lisbon treaty , the europarl gets a say in the decision of the ec president . 
  should juncker get it , he has zero power to make the eu more federal ; that can only come from treaty revision with the member states . 
  the decision on who gets chosen as the ec president is done through a qualified majority . 
  again , this is all spelled out in the treaties the uk signed , not that the uk was forced into by the eu . 
  if you guys do n't have the votes , you do n't have the votes - no one is forcing you into any kind of federalism you did n't agree to already . 
  he is suggesting shooting refugees to harm people smugglers . 
  do you not see the inherent moral issues with that ? 
  and do you not see how that is different to a non-violent mission to prop up a weak government with military and police support ? 
  he did n't say * shoot at them * . 
  he said * shoot them * . 
  i 'm not suggesting going into countries and killing people . 
  if you ca n't see the difference between a peacekeeping operation , as australia did in the solomon islands , or timor leste , and what / u/ramblinrambo suggested which was gunning down refugees by the boatload to prevent more coming , thereby ` saving ' them from drowning , then i have to say you may be heavily mentally impaired . 
  yeah , it is , but that was n't the issue . 
  the point was , that / u/cbfw86 seemed to be implying that the uk had to threaten to leave to have influence in the eu , ignoring that they have influence - but sometimes they get outvoted . 
  no , you lying shit . 
  [ here 's the full context ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/260a0q/how_immigrants_are_changing_swedens_welfare_state/chmy4mo?context=1 ) . 
  you were explicitly stating that it was arabs that ` filth ' , i read the comment before it was ( rightly ) deleted by the mods . 
  why else would it have been deleted , if you were just giving some clarity ? 
  hint : you were n't , you were being a racist fucking lying shit . 
   i 've made it very clear that unlike you i 'm neither a leftist or socialist of any sort . 
  so nazism does n't really fit my political bill at all . 
  i 'm not a ` leftist ' or ` socialist ' either , and i 'd challenge you to go through my history looking for anything that shows that . 
  i have n't deleted any comments . 
  i 'm just not a racist , which seems to be enough for you to label someone a ` leftist ' . 
  you once told me you do n't delete you old comments . 
  funny then , that you have so many deleted comments on matters of race , ethnicity , and immigration , comments which were deleted by the mods for breaching the rules about racism . 
  you are a racist . 
  except , as i said , you 've [ explicitly said very racist things about all arabs in since-deleted comments here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/260a0q/how_immigrants_are_changing_swedens_welfare_state/chmyn06 ) and horrible shit about roma [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/267mmq/reurope_what_does_an_average_family_home_look/chontsu ) . 
  it 's clearly beyond all doubt that you 're a stormfront style neonazi . 
  you 've already written enough ( explicitly ) about arabs to prove that you 're an out-and-out racist , you write plenty about immigrants in general . 
  it 's not much of a leap . 
  more of a step . 
   of intervention and the aggressive use of military force . 
  ever since 1964 , when denmark completely broke with almost a century of defensive neutrality by joining the british lead un forces in cyprus , denmark has been very active on the international stage providing troops for nearly all major nato and un missions . 
  ultimately foreign relations and the military is not influenced by the eu ( yet ? ), 
  so our eu goals are still very much in line with germany 's . 
  and i 'll praise them to my dying day for it , much better than those who avoid international responsibilities and the ` difficult ' decisions . 
  the other influence you have is what you can garner negotiating in the council of ministers , or what the meps from your country choose to vote for . 
  if you still get outvoted , then tough - that 's democracy . 
  i do n't know . 
  as i said , it was something i 'd * heard * . 
  your counterargument was insufficient to disprove it , so i pointed that out . 
  you do n't need to have an official whip to rule the party you lead tyrannically . 
  the rules do n't get thrown out , they get put aside until one party comes out victorious . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  how is that irrelevant to what we were talking about ? 
  mate , that you even think that shooting unarmed men , women , and children who are refugees is acceptable puts you on the same level as the executioners in this video . 
  oh , you 're so witty and clever . 
  yeah , except some of your comments there have since been deleted . 
  i just told you why they * would n't * sell russia lhcs ( they have no interest in making them themselves ) , and you claim i 'm moving goalposts ... 
  it 's debatable about if india would even built them with russia , i have n't seen them say they have any need for lhcs . 
  the onus is on you to prove that india has an interest , otherwise my point stands .
