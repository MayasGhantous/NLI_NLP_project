   no you 're professionally offended by the way you are trying to go around asking for banns , or the creation of other subs to opinions that do n't suit you and your world view . 
  i 'm calling for your ban , * because you repeatedly break the rules * . 
  the creation of another sub would be an alternative solution to keep the racist/xenophobes/bigot out , lessening the work load on moderators , who have to keep going through your comments and deleting them . 
   well i kind of do and it does not have anything to do with your ethnicity . 
  i 'm also fairly sure that by now you see me as a sub-human . 
  do i cry over it , no . 
  should i ? 
  it 's an opinion and nothing more . 
  i most certainly do n't see you as sub-human . 
  one of my great hopes is that one day you 'll realize how abhorrent your positions are . 
  that , or that you 'll one day see the shame in your children 's eyes over the opinions you have . 
   that inherently means that you have an issue with opinions . 
  furthermore your definition on what is `` racist '' is very happy-go-go . 
  shooting at a boat with immigrants is n't racist . 
  it does not make any statement on ethnicity . 
  it does not make any statement on xenophobia , it only is a statement about doing a to stop b. 
  nothing more , nothing less . 
  you , yourself make it `` racist '' . 
  it 's not a broad definition . 
  pre-judging people based on your subjective opinion that they are not-native , or on the basis of their physical characteristics . 
  that 's the commonly accepted contemporary definition of racism . 
  i also never said that your policy on shooting refugees was racist , so do n't make bullshit up please . 
   there are many `` professionally-offended-people '' out there . 
  yes , i 'm ` professionally offended ' because i try and explain to a racist , xenophobic , sociopathic , bigot that their opinion is abhorrent . 
   you preach tolerance but you seem to be very intolerant yourself . 
  yes , i 'm intolerant of intolerance . 
  so sue me . 
  it 's funny how you equate `` cuddly we-want-to-save-the-world-and-sing-togheter-sub '' with our actual stance of ` let 's not murder people trying to make it to europe , commit human rights violations , and break international law '' , the opposite of what you support . 
  it has nothing to do with being anti-eu . 
  i get on fine with a number of very eurosceptic members . 
  i have a problem with racists , however , because they always want to push the topic to immigration and race issues , regardless of their relevance . 
  worse than that , i absolutely despise the idea that if i were brown , you would see me as sub-human ( given you 've said many remarks along those lines in the past ) , and would probably want to see me dead rather than in europe . 
  but i 'm not brown , i 'm white , and i 'd hate to see the kind of views that you espouse affect my many non-white friends who live and contribute to society and try and make it a better place , probably more so than you do , simply because of the colour of their skin . 
   well that is quite of a subjective opinion is n't it . 
  long before i ever posted my first comment in / r/europe [ 1 ] i was amazed what a circlejerk it was in here . 
  i mean the kind of people that have actually studied a topic in depth , work in that field , and posted long informative comments about it . 
  i do n't mean quality posters in terms of ` people i agree with ' . 
  great to hear , am very excited for the forthcoming announcement in that case !, 
  i do n't find it odd at all that you , a person that once claimed that all refugees that get to europe , are instantly given cars , expensive mobile phones , and houses , would not understand that these days racism is a blanket term for discrimination against all kind of people that are not considered ` native ' . 
  no , i 'm wondering how you got such a conclusion out of my comment . 
  different moderators remove different comments , and then none will see the pattern of behaviour . 
  / r/europe has * maybe * 1000 comments on it per day , often less if there is nothing big going on , and maybe a quarter of that number are longer than a paragraph . 
  it may have 50,000 members , but the overwhelming majority of those are inactive . 
  it should not be so difficult to take a proactive approach and read through the comments when there are ten moderators . 
  this is a subreddit that has long had serious troubles with racism . 
  i think it 's a question of whether the moderators think it 's enough to just respond to comments that get reported , or whether they should take on an approach more akin to that of / r/askhistorians where comments breaking the rules are actively sought out . 
  regardless , i 've been contacted by a number of former quality posters of / r/europe ( and seen the posts where such people say they no longer want to participate due to the tide of racism and xenophobia ) to think that there should be a more proactive approach , perhaps coupled with more moderators that are willing to be active , as i do n't think we should be sacrificing the quality of much of the discussion here for the sake of taking a relaxed stance on racists . 
  author of the article complaining about how the ` left ' take too simplistic a view of the right , and he responds with a comment that is an overly simplistic view of the left, 
  eh , i agree with that sentiment , i thought there were better musical acts . 
  it was n't * bad * . 
  it was even actually one of the best ones . 
  but i do n't think , from a technical standpoint , it deserved first place . 
  in the context of this argument , it was n't used in that way . 
  this comment . 
  this comment is by far my favourite in this thread . 
  that no contrary opinions are allowed . 
  it 's a chamber , where only the echoes of one opinion are heard . 
  well then why not start with / u/ramblinrambo ? 
  [ what about this comment , where he is constantly shitting on roma ? 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/267mmq/reurope_what_does_an_average_family_home_look/chontsu ) or [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25is4z/italy_demands_help_threatens_to_release_refugees/chhrosh ) where he says we should gun down the children of refugees to prevent more coming ? 
  then there was a since deleted comment [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/260a0q/how_immigrants_are_changing_swedens_welfare_state/chmyn06 ) where he was talking about how arabs are scum . 
  it is really beyond me how this person has not been banned yet . 
  not even just because he 's racist , but because he is explicitly and repeatedly breaking the rules . 
  we agree on something for once ... 
  i 'm going to have to reexamine my opinion now to see what 's wrong with it . 
  yep , back in australia i could n't have imagined * not * having a beer with lunch at work . 
  oh , well with that i can certainly agree . 
  i ca n't even post on / r/australia any more . 
  if i even dare to suggest that one tiny thing the government is doing is n't so bad , instant downvotes . 
  i 'm a green party member ( in australia ) , even pay the membership fees , but if you do n't outright criticize the government for everything then you must be some lying , delusion , right-wing scumbag . 
  but that does n't change that the premise of the article is wrong . 
  there are still many places on the internet that are n't echo chambers , and the fact that the author of the article ca n't find them is more a reflection on him , than on the internet . 
  regardless , i do n't see this as a progressive subreddit ( aside from , perhaps , on issues such as climate-change , gay rights , etc ) . 
  there are a number of ` non-progressive ' posters here , considerably more than there would be in an ` echo chamber ' . 
  oh , yeah , that is pretty ridiculous . 
  but everyone thinks that they 're more right than everyone else . 
  after all , why else would they hold that opinion unless it was the best , to their knowledge , opinion to have ? 
  so it 's only natural that they think that everyone should vote socialist , libertarian , what have you . 
  well , yes . 
  in a democracy , you vote in your own interests . 
  i do n't see why i should take someone elses opinion into account when i vote ? 
  there are so many racists and bigots on here . 
  a huge amount . 
  i 've witnessed people in in / r/europe say horribly racist things about arabs , romani , etc. 
  that they are racist and bigotted is undeniable . 
  anyone that seriously says something like ` all arabs are savage fucks ' is clearly a racist , there is no leeway there . 
  then there are the people that even outright suggest gunning down refugee children to prevent more refugees coming . 
  it 's far from an echo chamber , given i 'm more often than not more downvoted than the person that makes such remarks . 
  it 's amazing to me that saying `` no , we should not shoot refugee children '' is somehow not being tolerant enough of other people 's views ... now , i do n't know why the moderators have n't been throwing out bans left , right , and centre ( and often do n't even delete such comments ) given they 're explicitly against the rules . 
  but something really ought to be done about it . 
  every few months there 's another self post that comes up on the resurgence of racism in the subreddit , the moderators are active for a few days , and then they quiet down for a few months . 
  maybe we could propose creating a new subreddit , / r/europeimmigration , where all posts regarding refugees , immigrants , and so on go so we do n't even have to deal with the issue of racism in this subreddit , we can pretend it 's not filled with bigots and racists - just like we do with europe in general . 
  cool heads talking it out may work amongst liberal-democratic countries that respect the rule of law , but russia is not one of those . 
  the only thing the russian regime understands in strength . 
  pah , the csto is just an organization for keeping russia 's friendly regimes in power , nothing more . 
  lukashenko once already said that he would not send belarussian soldiers to die in central asian states , and when , during the 2010 uprising in krygyzstan , the interim government requested assistance in restoring order , russia denied assistance because they did not want to promote a regime that was putting in a more liberal constitution . 
  actually , analyses of eurasian customs union have shown that it will have negative effects for all three economies . 
  i did a quick look for my source , and unfortunately could n't track it down , but it was an article in a peer-reviews journal . 
  however , [ here ] ( http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/research/russia%20and%20eurasia/0812bp_dragnevawolczuk.pdf ) is a briefing paper that supports my statement . 
   i 'd appreciate a discussion about how the eu could become more democratic and transparent though .
