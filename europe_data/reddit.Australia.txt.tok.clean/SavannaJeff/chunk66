  i would either disclude all those that applied for that and recalculate the total , or include them in the number of acceptees . 
  er , the subsidiary protection is granted to people who have a reasonable expectation of being harmed or killed upon return , so it 's not as if 86 % of people were found to be economic migrants . 
  rather , over 60 % needed the protection of the eu . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.news.com.au/world/ten-myths-around-asylum-seekers-arriving-on-boats-in-australian-waters/story-fndir2ev-1226676024840 )  australian government statistics from the first quarter of 2013 showed more than 90 per cent of asylum seekers who arrived by boat were found to be genuine refugees . 
  in comparison , those who arrived by plane - despite being eligible for release into the community and not having to face years of detention on nauru or manus island - were almost twice as likely to be rejected as refugees . 
  the figure continued a long-term trend of high approval rates for people arriving by boat , with 93.5 per cent being found to be refugees in 2010-11 and 91 per cent in 2011-12 . 
   you like using the word `` refugee '' because it 's sympathetic , but when pressed you refuse to offer any specific definition or proof . 
  many of these boat people are not under any specific threat , they 're economic migrants . 
  i 'm not familiar with the australian detention centers , but divideetimpera8 's hypothetical center sounded completely reasonable . 
  so basically `` i do n't know anything about the subject , so i 'm just going to listen to the opinion of another guy that knows nothing about the subject and draws a utopian picture '' , eh ? 
  as to refugees vs economic migrants , asylum seekers put into detention centres in australia were overwhelmingly ( 90 % + ) found to be genuine refugees . 
  given the recent turmoil in north africa and the levant , i can only assume the numbers there are similar . 
  but you 've long had a history of arguing without backing up your numbers or your ideas , and instead going on gut feeling . 
   pretty sure i covered this above . 
  oh yeah , i 'm half indian and my dad 's about as dark as they come , but do n't let that get in the way of your `` i 'm worried about the scary dark people '' hypothesis . 
  like there have never been selfish racist arseholes against their heritage before . 
   then why on earth would you mention it within the context of a discussion on detention centers for illegal immigrants ? 
  i did n't , i suggested it within the context of a discussion on detention centres and * refugees * . 
  look at [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/25is4z/italy_demands_help_threatens_to_release_refugees/chhwu0v ) , where it all started . 
  no mention of illegal immigrants ( which i believe should be kicked out of the country ) , but rather a discussion about ignoring the human rights of * refugees * . 
  to anyone that 's actually studied into the detention centre solution of australia , it 's far from a humane solution . 
  and given that you 're so willing to conflate illegal immigrants with refugees , ie ; those dark people that are a lot poorer than us , i ca n't help but see you as being a racist . 
  as to a substantial argument , how about this : fuck you . 
  the two were unrelated sentences ( as characterized by the ` regardless ' ) . 
  perhaps if you were n't such an anti-refugee racist xenophobe , you would 've caught that . 
  i 've had other users suggest that as well , and they were upvoted while i was downvoted for pointing out how heinous it was to seriously advocate shooting children on refugee boats to stop refugees coming . 
  i 've seen people advocate just letting people drown instead of helping them , one italian proposed invading north africa and keeping all africans away from the coast . 
  this is far from a first time kind of deal , and these were all regular posters . 
  there is a strong and troubling element of racism in europe . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  the ec spend a tremendous amount of time and energy into trying to stop the crisis . 
  jaques poos even famously said ` this is the hour of the europeans , not the americans ' . 
  it eventually led to the brijuni accord which kept slovenia out of the rest of the conflict after only ten days of fighting . 
  the problem was that member states interests were all over the place . 
  germany was for self determination , whilst the uk , france , and spain wanted yugoslavia to stay together . 
  regardless , the eu has been a driving force for continental peace , through countless initiatives and integrative regionalist practices . 
  hell , they 've even spend a few hundred million on northern ireland putting money into community funds that had to be jointly administered by both sides of the conflict so that they could both begin to understand eachother needs and sides of the story . 
  / u/ramblinrambo is a long time / r/europe poster . 
  i do n't think he 's stormfront , but he 's dangerous and crazy . 
  i do n't either , i just do n't see what mandate or ability the eu has to help . 
  lunatics in general . 
  people in desperate and shitty situations commit crimes , this is a well know and studied fact . 
  refugee camps that do n't have running water , no electricity , not enough food , few medical supplies , few guards , etc , are going to have conditions which lead people to commit crimes . 
  how are you going to do that ? 
  invade the territorial water of the country that the boat left from ? 
  over 50 % of tajikistan 's gdp comes from remittances from russia . 
  [ here ] ( http://scholar.google.pl/scholar_url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228187332_the_effectiveness_of_correctional_rehabilitation_a_review_of_systematic_reviews/file/3deec518c2b2abd5fc.pdf&amp;sa=x&amp;scisig=aagbfm1nd7qv8_zreigf_muozqottxwn-g&amp;oi=scholarr&amp;ei=k7hzu_fyooku7abkmid4ba&amp;ved=0cckqgamoadaa ) is a study conducted on meta-analyses ( studies of studies , essentially to find what the common trend is ) on prison recidivism . 
  it finds that those that receive sanctions ( penalties ) are more likely to commit crimes again , whilst those that undergo rehabilitation are less likely to commit crimes again , furthermore , they found that when you compare the largest reoffense rate for those that receive rehabilitation and the smallest reoffense rate for those that receive punishment , the ones that are punished still recommit crimes more often . 
  the conclusion is on page 314 , second paragraph if you 'd like to verify . 
  the results play out in this way in every study they analyzed , which was a considerable number . 
   second of all , i want my vengeance . 
  i wan na kick the fucker in the throat . 
  i 'm a mere mortal , sorry if that 's below you , jesus . 
  i was talking about the state and justice . 
  because the state has the monopoly on violence , you are not allowed to have vengeance . 
  only the state can dispense justice . 
   http://snag.gy/u48vu.jpg and according to [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/1jwzvt/accusations_of_british_censorship_and_mod_abuse/cbj6yp4 ) you have been banned . 
  in / r/uk . 
  and skuld never said he contacted strolls . 
  ouch . 
  so you 're saying that all four million refugees that have left syria are criminals and rapists ? 
  not a single one of my posts has been deleted by a moderator . 
  they asked me to remove a post once because it was pushing the rules , and i complied , but they have n't deleted them . 
  and it 's odd that there 's a woman from gibraltar with the absolute same abrasive style of writing , who showed up shortly after the last one was banned , with the same interests and political views , but they 're not the same person . 
  do n't you think ? 
  you want them to suffer , sure . 
  but that 's not the point of the justice system . 
  the justice system is there to provide the best outcomes for society . 
  if they think they can make this criminal turn into a productive member of society when they leave for the same price as just punishing them in a prison for the same amount of time , whilst also giving some consolation to the victim , then that is what should be done . 
  not torture . 
  and you never know if they will reoffend . 
  but there have been studies done on reoffending rates based on different methods used by the justice system , and some have higher rates of reoffending ( by treating them like they 're subhuman scum ) and some have lower rates of reoffending ( by treating them like they 're human ) . 
  i do n't know about you , but if a criminal has a better chance to come out of jail and not kill someone again then that is what i would want htem to do . 
   i disagree with this but even if it were true , it 's not like refugees are actually members of our civilization in the first place . 
  you 're fundamentally misunderstanding the point of the quote . 
  regardless , it 's clear that you see the justice system as the ` vengeance ' system , rather than a system that may rehabilitate criminals so that they do n't reoffend when they get out . 
  this is a habit of hers . 
  she runs around abusing people , lying about them , insulting them , generally being a shitty human being , arguing like a moron , and carrying on in general , and when they respond she contacts the moderators . 
  she 's done that to me , and it 's not the first time she 's been banned from / r/europe . 
  you can see a top comment about here [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/subredditdrama/comments/1jwzvt/accusations_of_british_censorship_and_mod_abuse/ ) in subredditdrama . 
  incidentally , got a link to the threat you were talking about ? 
  what is treating criminals as criminals ? 
  are we allowed to beat them ? 
  sexually assault them ? 
  torture them ? 
  you measure the degree of civilisation of a society by how it treats its weakest members , and i 'd say that criminals/refugees that are apprehended and can not defend themselves would count as those . 
  the news will have a field day when some journalists catch sight of european coast guards ignoring drowning children . 
  also , i 'm very uncomfortable with setting a precedent amongst our security forces of selectively obeying rules . 
  we all know what that leads to . 
  how many people do you have to have that agreement with ? 
  what do you think it might be about you , personally , that leads you to get into such situations ? 
  might it be that you 've been banned from / r/europe in the past under / u/salvaxe ? 
  or that you 've previously admitted to enjoying coming onto / r/europe and stirring up trouble ? 
  what ? 
  so your justification for committing human rights violations , is that no one asked you personally what you think human rights should be ? 
  as to your rights , well ... you know it 's not only refugees that kill people , yeah ? 
  you want your country to commit human rights violations ? 
  if italy is breaching human rights , then i fully support that . 
  as to the eu issuing warnings , i do n't see what power they have to help italy cope . 
  blame the member governments , not the eu .
