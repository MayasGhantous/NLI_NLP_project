  they were criticized by the unhcr even before the riots , beatings , and killings that occured this year . 
  you 're absolutely mistaken . 
  yeah , every twenty years they issue a blanket amnesty and green cards . 
  and are routinely criticized by the un human rights commission . 
  which ones are the humane ones ? 
  because if you 're referring to the australian ones , they 're far from humane ( and have even been criticized by the un human rights commission a number of times ) . 
  i sincerely doubt that other eu countries would want to get involved in anymore military excursions in north africa at the moment . 
  italy wants to start another north african colonial empire ? 
  i linked to it [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/22lerc/italy_has_rescued_4000_migrants_from_boats_trying/cgo29p1 ) . 
  it 's not pro-immigration hyperbole , if someone found a way to stop such boat crossings in a humane way i would be 100 % for it . 
  but people are n't making such proposals , so until a reasonable answer comes around i 'll continue shooting down shitty ideas . 
  hehe , never thought i 'd see people advocating ` camps ' in europe again ... 
  it was [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20ssaz/italian_ships_rescue_more_than_2000_migrants_in/cg6h716 ) and [ here 's someone quoting them ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/20usi0/dutch_politician_wilders_leads_antimoroccan_chant/cg7fojj?context=4 ) . 
  note how i get downvotes , but the guy that advocates gunning down children is upvoted ? 
  this sub is fucked up . 
  i get that there are people concerned with immigration that are n't racists , but if they want their concerns to be taken seriously they need to clamp down on their own crazies . 
  upvoting the guy that advocated shooting children is n't the way to make your argument heard . 
  he 's quoting 1984 . 
  / r/europe has taken long had a problem with racism ( witness [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/14oq15/racism_in_this_subreddit_is_out_of_control/ ) or [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/113a2w/meta_on_the_rising_levels_of_racism_in_this/ ) ) . 
  unfortunately , many of the quality reasonable posters have slowly been leaving as a result , people get sick of engaging with the racists ( who have a stronger vested interest in bringing up their agenda ) , and the racists are slowly taking over . 
  if you do n't have an understanding of geography , you do n't have an understanding of global issues and how they reflect on your own politics . 
  i do n't think there is a good solution . 
  perhaps one of the better ones could be a massive investment in na policing and port authorities to help stop the people smugglers , because detaining those that have already made it across will do absolutely nothing to make their business model less viable . 
  australia has been doing the off-shore processing ` solution ' , i only pray europe does n't follow suit . 
  it 's terribly inhumane , prone to massive abuse ( there was a riot recently in one detention centre , dozens injured including one brutally killed by australian-hired security services ) , and extremely costly . 
  in fifty years , the history books will be looking at it the same way they look at what australia did to the aborigines . 
  yep , the only thing that will ameliorate or solve the crisis is cooperation , not more attempts at shutting borders , or even gunning down children in boats as one redditer in / r/europe recently suggested . 
  and if tunisia/libya refuses to allow them in their territorial waters ? 
  what are you going to do , invade ? 
  leave the people in the middle of the sea to drown ? 
  what ? 
  regardless , once they 're on european soil they can claim asylum seeker status which means that , by italian law and under the un convention on refugees , they have to have their claim processed and be allowed to stay in italy whilst that happens . 
  i 've downloaded the submission , but do n't have time to read it in the next few days . 
  i do n't suppose you could list the salient points ? 
  edit : submission [ here ] ( http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/brexit%20winning%20entry.pdf ) for those curious . 
  you 're double digit green for me !, 
  hence why i said ` up to ' , but my numbers are rba numbers . 
  i have two kinds of people . 
  those with red numbers next to their name , and those with green numbers next to their name . 
  / u/pretzpretz is n't even in double digits , but that 's because i remembered his name and decided it was n't even worth bothering with that anymore . 
  australian economy is expected to grow by up to 3.25 % , so that 's not true . 
  you should edit that in , at the moment the meaning you have is * considerably * different, 
  so about on par with the daily mail ? 
  kinda like that old hitler joke : hitler and some other members of the nazi party are campaigning in a local tavern . 
  hitler says to the gathered crowd , `` when i become fuhrer , i 'm going to kill 6 million jews ... and one clown . '', 
  a member of the crowd shouts out , `` wait , why would you kill one clown ? '', 
  hitler turns to the other nazis and says , `` ah ha !, 
  i told you no one would care about 6 million jews ! '', 
  you 're a nut . 
  i did n't say they could easily pay * down * their debt , i said they could easily pay for it . 
  there are no sovereign debt crises looming in the us . 
  it 's only on resale of russian gas , they can still pipe gas produced in , e.g. 
  but it depends on ownership of the pipelines , often the various national sections are in large part owned by gazprom , if not majority share holders , of the pipeline . 
  it 's pretty well known ( and documented ) that most aid money is conditional , such as with a provision that it be spend on the giving country 's businesses , or that certain outcomes are expected . 
  no , they are also paid off . 
  the difference is that eu countries and the imf have to offer loans at significant discounts to he market rates , because if greece was issuing bonds directly to the market , the interest rate would be at least 5 % higher , and so greece would be unable to afford to make interest payments and pay for the bond when it reaches maturity . 
  the us does n't have tat problem . 
  they are paying them off , all the time . 
  bonds frequently reach maturation date and are paid off , as is the interest on those bonds . 
  because they can easily pay for them . 
  greeks ca n't pay for theirs . 
  i upvoted this because it was funny . 
  ** i 'm not calling them fascists ** . 
  how many times do i have to explain that to you ? 
  i did n't say they were * fascist * , i said they were * crypto-fascist * . 
  secondly , far-right is a term used to denote xenophobic , racist , or reactionary views as well , so it matters not that they also have strong social-democrat elements . 
   nor is the swedish population overwhelmingly pro eu - our parties are . 
  you mix them up . 
  i was only talking about the political parties there , not about the population as a whole . 
  i did n't say the country as a whole was overwhelming pro-eu , i said that the political parties overwhelmingly are pro-eu . 
  and how can you not call them crypto-fascist [ despite all the evidence to the contrary ] ( http://sv.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21c9sr/farright_party_on_rise_in_sweden_swedens_farright/cgbnc98 ) . 
  you 're telling me that sd are not eurosceptic and xenophobic , and that all the other parties except sd and vansterpartiet are not pro-eu ? 
  there 's the iterative version of the prisoner 's dilemma which would fit under what aschebescher said as well . 
  yep . 
  i did n't say it was case closed , i relayed what i heard from someone else . 
  but i see the res tag i gave you suits you well . 
  pretty poor display from the ec . 
  super cool . 
  the future is now !, 
  hendun mentioned there was one ukip like party in sweden , i said that that was sverigedemokraterna . 
  then i said that * almost * all the other parties a pro-eu . 
  i know that vansterpartiet are against . 
  i comment on topics i know something about , which is why i do n't talk about french of spanish political parties but having lived in sweden for a fear years , having a swedish girlfriend , and learning the language up to b2 i feel i had something to add . 
  i 'm not acting like a know-it-all , and i 'm not commenting on things i have no clue about . 
  it 's telling that the only swedes that ever claim that i 'm misinformed about sweden are sverigedemokraterna supporters , whilst the other swedes tend to agree with me . 
  spoke to a ukrainian student from donetsk today , he claims that they 're russian financed agent provocateurs , and that the majority of the city is against it . 
  no , but the majority of the country detests sd . 
  all the other party refuse to even deal with them . 
  [ heres a post by a swede supporting my conclusions ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21c9sr/farright_party_on_rise_in_sweden_swedens_farright/cgc9k7v ) . 
  anyone that wants to quickly come to grips with sd people can just browse the comments in that whole submission ) . 
  yeah , a pack of sverigedemokraterna apologists roam the subreddit quashing mainstream swedish opinion . 
  my response was limited to political parties . 
  regardless , i would n't say most are eurosceptic , but admittedly i did n't hang around blue collar areas much . 
  it 's one party , the far right xenophobic party that 's eurosceptic , almost all the other parties are decidedly pro-eu, 
  sorry , i meant easy to pick up as an english native speaker . 
  but i lived there for a few years and had a blast . 
  political landscape is very left compared to the uk . 
  current governing coalition is alliansen , consisting of centre right parties , but would be considered more centrist or even left in the uk . 
  very socially progressive , politically stable - except for sverigedemokraterna who is politically isolated , crypto-fascist far right party . 
  country as a whole is overwhelmingly pro-eu , progressive on refugees .
