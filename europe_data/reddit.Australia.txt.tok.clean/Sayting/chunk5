  russian air cover is a decisive part of that . 
  they are bombing people who stockpiled weapons in mosques and put women in cages above their hqs to prevent bombings . 
  i 'm pretty sure russia was n't bombing for shits and giggles . 
  source for the cages : https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3r2g0f/saa_soldiers_families_put_into_cages_in_douma_on/ http://imgur.com/a/n7uu6, 
  that 's all well and good but i want to dispel once and for all this fiction that germany does n't know what it 's doing . 
  germany knows exactly what it 's doing !, 
  they have been trying to push further in latakia all up to september . 
  i 'm glad i wo n't see how defensive they would have been if they had reached the alawite cities on the coast . 
  but luckily i wo n't because the ruaf and saa has cleansed those mountains despite turkey 's little terrorist supporting stab in the back . 
  everyone has a choice . 
  they chose to fight , they chose to ally with al nusra , they chose to shoot the pilot and now they will reap the rewards . 
  they were n't just picking flowers . 
  they are involved in armed insurrection against the government and both sides were happy to brutal when they 're winning . 
  yes . 
  so they supported the massacres instead ? 
  nusra 's allies are terrorists . 
  islamic state ` enjoyed turkish money for oil ' : israeli minister http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-israel-turkey-iduskcn0v421n turkey arrests editors over reports ankara supplied weapons to syrian fighters http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/12019905/turkey-arrests-editors-over-reports-ankara-supplied-weapons-to-syrian-fighters.html, 
  maybe turkey should stop the supplying terrorists through the turkish border . 
  then russian bombing runs wo n't be so close . 
  problem is donald would actually have more of chance because bernie would face even more opposition in the republican congress as a socialist and as longtime independent would even have the loyalty of the democratic party to backup his ideas . 
  it can literally be used as a point and shoot weapon without a radar complex supporting it . 
  it identifies the height/position of the aircraft you press a button and thats it . 
  the problem is house of saudi is by a large the source of the instability in the rest of middle east . 
  exporting and funding radicals and fighters to the rest of the middle east in exchange for a blind eye to their hedonism . 
  yeap just for shits and giggles, 
  no evidence at all . 
  it 's a complete fabrication to say they have been funded by russia particular with funding laws in the uk . 
  ukip is n't funded by russia, 
  [ quote by zamir kablov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zamir_kabulov ), 
  rebel twitter confirmed . 
  plus it 's a good source for the conflict . 
   local activist group in a rebel city totally not propaganda, 
  thats because its not true, 
  36 of those were fighters not civilians and it killed a rebel islamist battalion commander in a sharia law court they had set up . 
  there were civilian losses but it was a legitimate target . 
  because russia is launching far more strikes . 
  so should ukraine become the united republic of novorossiya and ruthenia then ? 
  let 's legitimise turkey 's invasion . 
   sigh , i swear that blog together with warisboring are the tmz of military news . 
  which makes me wonder why they are so damn popular or everyone assumes that the things they report are actually true . 
  1 ; originally it was planned to buy around 50-60 frames in one initial contract . 
  these frames are `` phase 1 '' frames with the izd .117 engines . 
  these frames were to be delivered in 2016-2020 timeframe . 
  2 ; a bigger contract was planned after 2020 , these frames would have a complete new engine , izd .30 among with other improvements . 
  no numbers for this contract has ever been stated officially . 
  all the 200-300 etc numbers were always a complete speculation . 
  now the plans have slightly changed . 
  instead of buying 60 frames in one go , they are buying 12 , test them til they basically cant fly any more and iron out all the bugs . 
  only then will russian mod buy more frames . 
  it is not unlike the lrip batch buys of f-35 usaf does and no one seems to gossip about that . 
  look at page 2 , they only bought 2 aircraft with the first lrip and only 12 with the second . 
  with su-35s they bought 48 frames in one go before that plane ever did more than 500 flights . 
  lots of things were still not tested at that point . 
  result was that a good dozen of frames had to go back to the factory and be updated just one year after they were built . 
  they dont want to repeat that with t-50 . 
  post from / r/militaryporn on the order numbers https://www.reddit.com/r/militaryporn/comments/3f4voi/my_pak_fa_armament_infographic_poster_1920_x/ctlkpxe do n't know where you got the indian info but india is building a domestic trainer aircraft at the moment so its understandable they did n't want the yak-130 . 
  the rafale also had a massive cut in numbers ( 200 to 36 ) due to cost and morsi is expected to sign the deal for the pak fa and the s-400 when he goes to russia this month . 
  what do you mean ? 
  its entering production next year so testing should be almost complete ( although with the interim engine ) . 
  how the hell is it putin stirring the pot when it 's turkey sending in troops to build a base in iraq with the government 's permission ? 
  as opposed to normandy which is still in open rebellion / s, 
  \u00cd do n't know if it was just that town but when i was in velikiye luki it seemed like every twenty-something year old was pushing a pram . 
  ypg is basically embargoed by turkey . 
  why drive it across syria , in an area owned by your political rivals , when you have a direct pipeline . 
  the ypg and the krg are jockeying for influence in a post-civil war rojave . 
  the krg are supported by turkey and the ypg has ties to the pkk . 
  iraqi kurdistan tankers traveled through syrian ypg territory and were let through the turkish border . 
  i 'm going call bullshit on that one . 
  there 's backward , there 's gulf state backward and there is saudi backward, 
  lol . 
  are they going catch putin on the grassy knoll ? 
  the article is wrong . 
  russia has n't stopped bombing near the border . 
  on fact they have expanded their bombing campaign to the border crossings and have started bombing turkish convoys to rebels , something they held off doing till recently . 
  there will be another war but i doubt there will be a faction as bad as isis . 
  the war/s will be between either : a ) the iraqi kurds and iraqi shia b ) the iraqi and the syrian kurds c ) the kurds and turkey, 
  sorry meant per capita, 
  russia has sent less fighters to isis ** per capita ** then france or britain . 
  how much police pressure is there in london ? 
  ** edited **, 
  russia pays for the electricity and sells the coal the ukrainian power plants . 
  ukraine needs both the money and the coal . 
  it was two su-24 . 
  russia did n't think the bombers needed an escort . 
  in fact the su-30s they sent to escort their bombers were assigned to bombing operations because it was though they were n't needed . 
  bombing weapons convoys ? 
  [ not just the border . 
  s-400s based at the major russian airbase on the coast and damascus would cover at lot more ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jqpiwts.png ), 
  the jaf is the dominant faction in the rebels . 
  the jaf is lead by al nusra . 
  the free syrian army in the north is a joke . 
  it is strategically insignificant beyond its role of providing anti-armour support for the jaf . 
  https://twitter.com/sametdgn1/status/667418064363913216 on the ground reporter for turkish state media confirming nusra presence in the area . 
  al nusra and the jaf are the dominant rebel group in the north . 
  any other group that does n't follow their orders for offensives gets attacked . 
  al nusra have a particular strong presence in latakia as they were the ones who spearheaded that offensive in 2014 . 
  are al nusra not terrorists ? 
  the `` fsa '' groups in the area are lead by al nusra . 
  thats why turkey refers them as turkmen because they ca n't go by the actual name . 
  dozens of terrorists or are al nusra freedom fighters now ?
