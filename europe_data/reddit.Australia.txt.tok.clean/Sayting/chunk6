  they shot it down because it was bombing the turkmen branch of al nusra not because of any humanitarian concerns . 
  turkey was just mad russia was bombing their favourite terrorists . 
  just al nusra . 
  much better / s, 
  turkish civilians fighting for al nusra maybe, 
  so the ukrainian supports a foreign state sending terrorists into a neighbouring country ? 
  nato supports al nusra ? 
  news to me . 
  jaish al-fateh is led by nursa . 
  that 's who your government is supporting . 
  the rebels russia was bombing were a turkmen branch of al-nusra . 
  turkey said a few days ago there would consequences for bombing them . 
  of course , turkey shot them down because they bombing their sponsored terrorists . 
  they were shooting at the parachute, 
  the rebels killed him . 
  there 's a photo with them posing with the dead pilot . 
  they shot it down because it was bombing their favourite terrorists . 
   i refuse reality and substitute my own, 
  edited for clarity, 
  the ukrainians buy russian coal because its the cheapest . 
  because of this stupidity the russians have stopped supply it ukraine . 
  not mention that power was cut to much of kherson as well . 
  because russia pays for the power and supplies the coal ** for the power-stations in ukraine ** ** edited **, 
  pull factors count . 
  if only refugees who are processed at the un camps are granted asylum then the numbers of those who attempt to travel will go down . 
  send them back to the camps and process them there , no exceptions . 
  that way you can at least separate the syrians from the other groups who travel on fake passports . 
  if they truly are fleeing a war zone then they are processed fairly quickly . 
  its only the economic refugees who throw away their documents who remain in he camps for long periods of time . 
  i guess i must bigot for believing that we should spend money supporting refugees taken direct from un camps like we can do now in syria rather spending millions finding out whether a rich middle class shia iranian is actually a prosecuted minority like he claims . 
  the camps are so empty at the moment the only people who are there are foreign criminals waiting to be deported and a few hundred people whose asylum claims have been denied . 
  that 's down from the four thousand along on christmas island three years ago . 
  love the ad hominem attack by the way , 
  if its stupid and it works it ai n't stupid, 
  [ context : present for isis ] ( https://twitter.com/yurybarmin/status/667727064225685506 ), 
  thanks op for reminding how much contempt i have for new matilda, 
  poland would still end up paying more for gas . 
   russian arsonist arrested for setting fire to security service hq ftfy, 
  the government is already starting to go through the same infighting that the happened after the orange revolution . 
  that seems impossible . 
  shipping would raise the gas price considerably which is why most proposals for export focus on the more profitable asian market where prices are higher . 
  sisi has been getting closer to russia . 
  maybe putin is doing him a solid . 
  or maybe , just maybe they find out what the facts where before claiming terrorism or black holes . 
   `` it is genuinely shocking to think that the british government has some kind of information that could cast light on what happened in the skies above egypt , '' ms zakharova said . 
  `` if such information exists , and judging by what the foreign secretary has said it does , no one has passed it to the russian side . '' sounds like they are just complaining that no intelligence has been given post the bombing, 
  it 's 90s corruption more then anything . 
  one of the early vice russian roulettes just after crimea . 
  funnily enough the vehicle in the original photo is one of few that were 100 % confirmed to not come from russia but rather from an ukrainian army unit that disarmed early in the crisis . 
  europe should really start looking into temporary protection visas . 
  france be nice . 
  jeb 's already having a bad week . 
  compared to moldova its not, 
  or they will be as long as he has anything to say about it, 
  i do n't watch russian language . 
  i 'm going by government statements . 
  even official maps put out the defense ministry for the media have groups other then isis where they are bombing . 
  that 's not true . 
  they also did it for saudi cash as well . 
  the russian government has been fairly clear that they are bombing all groups they consider `` terrorists '' in syria not just isis and to be honest considering the greater part of the fsa is lead by al-nusra they are a legitimate target . 
  russia does however support the ypj as legitimate non-government fighters and has been trying to arrange an autonomy deal . 
  yanukovych was a corrupt b * stard but you can hardly call him a russian patsy . 
  he always preferred to join the eu over eeu . 
  it took major russian arm twisting and a much better deal then what the eu was offering to convince him to go the russian route, 
  helicopters and russian fittings ( radar , fcs and so forth i would imagine ), 
  and the renovation of their shipyards . 
   they will not direct more asylum seekers towards the border with hungary because this would `` cause them suffering '' said the minister . 
  meaning that hungary wo n't put up with the croatian government 's b * llshit ? 
  both iran and russia were invited in by assad . 
  its not the wombat 's fault . 
  the kiwi kept shouting sex at him after he asked the time . 
  he 'll be gone before cameron, 
  there have been several articles on the russian strikes on the subreddit . 
  normally if it involves a european country its fair game . 
  seems you 're wrong https://twitter.com/f1ea1337/status/649689193552199680, 
  they want iran there, 
  they 're `` trying '' excluding all european partners because they ca n't just exclude france . 
  france tried to scuttle the iranian due to saudi influence . 
  that was a rebel barracks in kafranbel that they hit . 
  that source is the most fawningly biased article i have ever read, 
  trump likes people who compliment him . 
  it 's as simple as that . 
  which party is most likely to win the next parliamentary elections and whose lining up to challenge him in 2019 ? 
  has n't russia stopped bombing aleppo for the last week with the humanitarian pauses ? 
  they began ramping back up after the south aleppo offensive by the rebels broke the ceasefire back in march . 
  it 's hardly a secret in fact they recently posted images of russian crewed artillery unit . 
  leaving armoured vehicles behind was the major pre condition of the dnr president in the press conference i saw before the breakout . 
  honestly why would you allow enemy troops to leave an encirclement and leave them the capacity to literally turn around and attack you . 
  it was incredibly stupid but was ordered . 
  donbass battalion commanders were quite clear in their anger at ukrainian gov/dod for ordering it . 
  the intent of the law is that you identify yourself as a combatant and not a civilian or a soldier on the same side as your enemies . 
  the bdus meet that standard . 
  because in ilovaisk the ukrainian command decided to breakout rather than surrender their armoured vehicles to rebels/russians and be allowed to leave, 
  because it 's a lie, 
  the offer was the army give up their weapons and vehicles and they 'd be allowed to leave not drive out of an encirclement with tanks and not be fired upon, 
  they were wearing russian uniforms . 
  that 's more applying to dressing as civilians or enemy soldiers . 
  because their pro western parties are extremely corrupt . 
  so are their pro russian parties but they have n't been in power for a while .
