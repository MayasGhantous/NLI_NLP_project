  edit : fun fact , the lack of celibacy for the educated and intelligent classes of the east is a favourite point to bring up by eastern ethnic purists/fascist as to why east asians consistently score higher iq 's than europeans . 
  ( the theory being that the smarter people in europe for a millennium became priests and did n't procreate ) . 
  celibacy is rarely practiced in eastern religions historically , and many of them have changed their stance on it in the last 100 to 200 years , celibacy and the control of sex is much more of a christian thing . 
  it 's really shocking to realise that the australian economy is almost as large as the russian economy , because we are pretty much the definition of an irrelevant country on the world stage . 
  if europe wants to have an open border policy with the middle east , and ignore the millions of people in refugee camps in turkey and jordan , that 's a european migration issue . 
  your continent has been in recession for 7 years with debt up to your ears , you should be asking yourselves what is the most efficient use of resources .

  * cough * world war 1 , world war 2 , cold car , balkans war , ukraine ... * cough * , of course , this is n't a reason to have open borders with the middle east though . 
  does n't that describe europe in a nutshell ?

  [ we 've managed to create a succesful multicultural nation with people from every country and every religion on the planet , yet we 've never had any group be this violent and call for the beheadings of australians than middle eastern muslimsm , it 's truely terrifying .

  are there any cases of this law being tested in court in sweden to you knowledge ? 
  we did that in australia when the gfc/financial crisis hit and it has been regarded as a key part of how we avoided recession . 
  we gave everyone that was on some kind of welfare payment ( apparently about 80 % of people ) $ 900 / $ 1400 / $ 2100 ( the largest payment was to pensioner couples , smallest to students ) . 
  here is a long report on it : http://andrewleigh.org/pdf/fiscalstimulus.pdf you can draw your own conclusions from the data . 
  [ weird , i thought we topped these stats as australians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_wealth_per_adult ), 
  ` legalese ' in english developed during the norman occupation during the first few hundred years of the last millennium , so the actual grammar rules do n't correlate with modern day english which makes it quite hard . 
  thanks , 
  it should be `` the poles '' , not '' the polish '' , in this context . 
  yes , english is retarded . 
  the polish people , are the poles , yet the hungarian people , are the hungarians . 
   1683 called can i ask why you picked this specific year ? 
  were n't there centuries of wars between the austro-hungrarians and the ottomans ? 
  very few people do trades in the anglosphere , it 's why they are some of the best paid jobs in aus/can/nz / uk . 
   imperial federation no . 
  keep your mits off our clay . 
  educated hard working assimilated immigrants , europe often says no : /, 
  yep , it varies in indonesia but there are plenty of muslims there that will share a beer with you , 
  but i had such a good rebuttal to why this graph was so inaccurate :p, 
  being able to be asked `` where are you from ? '', 
  does n't mean that the recipient is any more or less an american/canadian/kiwi / convict . 
  we commonly ask that in australia , largely because we are curious about what food you know how to cook , and curious about your background . 
  having a different origin does n't make you a denizen or lesser individual in the nation , it 's not a zero sum game where if someone is 30 % identifying with their italian heritage , they can only 70 % identify with their new nation . 
  it is common and completely possible to identify with both . 
  people are complex mixtures of experiences and ideas , not robots that need to follow a pre aligned set of inflexible traditions and ideas . 
  of course , i accept that this i different in a european context than in the anglosphere . 
  thee german love of recycling is very ... intimidating and confusing to me as an australia the amount of different recycling bins you use !, 
  litigation . 
  some context : [ this graph represents the lack of information due to the media black out on the topic in 2013 , also this list everyone that has died on their way to australia and in immigration detention centres ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-23/government-won27t-reveal-when-boats-turned-back/4975742 ) the australian border deaths database is n't a government database but a private one run by monash university in melbourne , based on what information they can find . 
  [ here are their sources , which list everyone that has died ] ( http://artsonline.monash.edu.au/thebordercrossingobservatory/publications/australian-border-deaths-database/ ), 
  yea , as an australian we do n't see the same issues with islam in indonesia , these issues seem to be a uniquely middle eastern islamic problem . 
   german source why is no one deported ? 
  the uk has no control over tarrifs , that 's all in the control of the eu . 
  well we all have free trade deals with each other bar the uk as they are an eu member . 
  you could always learn to cook for yourself instead of living with mumma . 
  let 's just hope this insanity trend in the anglosphere stops here though . 
  there 's talks in australia in the last two days about developing pur own nuclear deterrent , everything changed with trumps election . 
  a common defence policy was a main reason for australian federation , it could be an impetus to eu integration . 
  we call it tall poppy syndrome , its similar to the scandanavian jantes law https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/tall_poppy_syndrome https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/law_of_jante, 
  lizzy is the head of state of hundreds of millions of people though, 
  do you think britain will use its military capacity in negotiating a favourable brexit from eastern europe ? 
  russian aggression in europe really should be a european issue to handle ( which they really are n't ) , european @ really should n't leave themselves to the whims of us elections , there is only so far the usa can be stretched across the globe . 
  its interesting watching this slow evolvement of a european identity . 
  i 'll never get over a danish person saying that we ( europeans including the british ) invented soccer , it was just so odd for because in my head the ` we ' should have meant australia included with the uk not a dane included with the uk . 
  i 'm not sure how one is meant to define ` europrean values ' though , there deffinately is a european culture and identity , we 've been seeing it all the time in australia among fellow europeans in recent years . 
  but in such a smaller amount than a real federation . 
  take sales tax in australia , its 10 % everywhere and divided up based on the ` ability of the states to generate their own revenue , currently tasmania gets a bit over $ 3000 per capita , and western australia gets about $ 900 per capita . 
  its at no where near that level in the eu and it wo n't change anytime soon . 
  devaluing actually costs alot of money , the government actually had to by and sell foreign cash reserves to keep the exchange rate steady . 
  a floating currency is much more reactive to markets and helps to maintain stability as a shock absorber . 
  i should add that i do n't see an alliance with china as the `` fear of the yellow peril ( china and it 's giant population , followed by japan ) '' has been the main focus of australian foreign policy since before federation in 1901 . 
  one of the main reasons for federation was to control immigration which lead to the white australia policy ; which basically restricted non anglo immigration until after ww2 , and was finally dismantled in the 70s opening up immigration to everyone . 
  in the end of the day , our politicans are just trying to play both sides because we have to and we 're just hoping we do n't have to choose . 
  after all , they are both nuclear powers , so it 's not like an actual war will occur , and we have ftas with both so we ca n't really join a trade war anyway . 
  if anything , i reckon we 're more likely to align with asean , there are a few commonwealth countries there ( malaysia and singapore ) that are sea trading nations that we have good relations with and alliances with . 
  actually singapore has compulsory military service and as they are an island state they do all their training in australia , and so it 's been building a cultural bond between singaporeans and australians and they are included in the anglosphere in our eyes along with hong kong . 
  haha , you should have seen the alarm on our foreign ministers face and our pms when the went on tv to congratulate donald trump . 
  american backed `` rules based order '' is going to be the catch phrase of canberra this week . 
  ill see if i can find some vids on youtube . 
  the election has deffinately got people worried that the usa will abandon our alliance , but at least donald hasnt said anything bad about australia . 
  the keeping the shipping lanes safe is n't something i 've really thought about , it 's just never talked about as an issue . 
   australia , new zealand  in the future they might turn toward china , especially with a decline of the us navy . 
  there is no way we would turn away from the usa to china , yes we are riding the chinese growth wave by selling them rocks and getting rich , but its nothing like the history we have with the usa . 
  we 've been to every armed conflict with them since ww2 to honour our end of our alliance and we are n't leaving it any time soon . 
  australia , we 're the only country to have gone to every armed conflict with the usa since ww2 and there is deep integration of all our intelligence agencies . 
  the usa australia is the only real alliance we have , we are n't in any nato type organisation . 
  the lesser known 12th chapter of accession to the eu , the talent contest . 
   get laid with alien babes - james t. kirk, 
  i think its important to note that the turkish mosques have everything conducted in turkish , hence why they are n't really apart of the syrians views as they speak arabic not turkish ( and hence do n't go to turkish mosques ) . 
  france has also had significant immigration though , unlike poland . 
  more like billions a year , it costs around $ 500,0000 / year to keep them in nauru . 
  * finally had morning coffee * well that was stupid of me . 
   democracy needs educated electorate , however , almost every single politician wants to make people more stupid , just to achieve his goals . 
  this is why i think compulsory voting has been the saving grace of australia over the last hundred years . 
  because people will be voting regardless , it 's in the politicians best interests to ensure we are as informed as possible . 
  let 's not get side tracked between a debate about superior common-law and inferior codified law systems . 
  if being proud of your country ( or say the eu ) makes you blind to its faults , then that 's a problem ; being proud of it does n't mean you have to or should be blind to its faults . 
  and some have barely more history than exporting starting patatoe farmers to the commonwealth ... 
  where would you rank the australian accent out of curiosity ? 
  something seems to have been lost in the currency conversions , australias minimum wage is $ 17.70 or closer to 12.28 euros at today 's exchange rates . 
  except the entire commonwealth and anglosphere . 
  with brexit , the usa and china are now both larger markets than the eu minus the uk,
