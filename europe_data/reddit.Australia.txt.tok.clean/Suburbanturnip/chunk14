  you know , doing something helping the millions of hopeless people in camps instead of patting ourselves on the back for helping the rich ones that can afford people smugglers for a year or two and then considering it job done . 
  also refugees ! = immigrants . 
  there are millions of educated wealthy peopleful people that would love to move to europe , instead you 've focused on only bringing in people you can have a superiority complex over . 
  it 's ok canada-bro , europeans do n't get how we made multi-cultural ism work ; so instead of taking a long hard look at themselves , they just blame the concept . 
  do n't take it too personally . 
  young refugees accepted by germany since the beginning of last year will cost the country an extra 67 billion euros ( $ 100 billion ) to educate and train , according to a new assessment of the bill for the migrant influx . 
  the new school year is getting under way with calls for 25,000 more teachers and reports that thousands of migrant children will be denied a classroom place because schools are full . 
  about 40 per cent of the 1.1 million people who arrived in germany last year and the 220,000 who came during the first half of this year are believed to be aged 20 or under . 
  angela merkel , the chancellor , is expected to face a backlash at her home state 's elections next month in the latest opportunity for germans to give their verdict on her decision to allow so many asylum seekers into the country , putting a huge strain on resources . 
  `` we have done some new calculations which put the full cost of refugees coming to germany at euros 67 billion through their whole education pathway , '' said dieter dohmen , president of the research institute for the economics of education and social affairs in berlin . 
  the as yet unpublished study anticipates that up to 1.5 million refugees aged 20 and under will enter germany 's education and training system by 2020 . 
  it includes the cost of higher education in a country where university tuition is provided free of charge . 
  the bill for 2016 is put at euros 15 billion . 
  `` if we look at the numbers so far some 200,000 have to go to kindergarten while another 300,000 will have to go to school . 
  then there is vocational education and training and higher education . 
  if you look at someone who is three , they have to go to childcare , primary , secondary and higher education so this is a figure for the next 20 years . '' the challenge would require up to 25,000 more teachers , mr dohmen said . 
  at the moment many integration classes were being run by volunteers . 
  schools were also struggling against bureaucratic barriers , for example to rehiring recently retired teachers . 
  `` the [ state education ] ministries are working extremely hard to deal with the situation but basically they are understaffed and they have quite complicated recruitment procedures , '' he said . 
  germany had been experiencing a dramatic decline in the numbers of schoolchildren due to a falling birthrate . 
  in 2005 , 822,000 started the school year while in 2015 this was down to 709,000 , according to destatis , the statistics agency . 
  `` the school system was not prepared for this number of new students , '' said marlis tepe , president of the education union which represents teachers . 
  `` we have 16 federal states and these 16 governments have to hire something like 25,000 new teachers , but there are not enough teachers and in some regions they are difficult to find . '' ms tepe said that about 14,000 new teachers had already been recruited to deal with the migrant surge . 
  armin himmelrath , an education journalist who has written the refugees are here , a book on best practice , said : `` almost every school in germany will have to deal with refugees because of the way they are distributed around the country . 
  as well as teachers , schools need social workers and psychologists -- the idea of a social worker at a school is not very common in germany . '' classroom policy is run by each state with some integrating refugees from the day they arrive and others sending them to language lessons separately for months . 
  `` one of the ideas many schools had in the beginning was to put all those who did not speak german properly together in a class until they can switch to regular lessons , '' said mr himmelrath . 
  `` actually what we found out and education scientists told us was that it was better not to separate the new children completely . 
  they should have some time in the regular class . '' alternative for germany , the anti-immigrant party which is polling at 19 per cent in mrs merkel 's home state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , is arguing that native german pupils will lose out from the effort to integrate migrants .

   australia we became multicultural after ww2 as a part of our [ `` populate or perish '' ] ( http://www.sbs.com.au/immigrationnation/resources/article/176/populate-or-perish ) , we could n't get enough brits to move here so we widened the pool to displaced european refugees from ww2 , and then in the 60s and 70s wided it out to asians . 
  [ our white australia policy did n't end until 1975 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_australia_policy ) . 
  now days , we are simply one of the richest countries and most stable in the world , and especially for our region , making immigration to australia quite competitive . 
  countries change their demographics for a whole host of reasons , a colonial past is one , ours initially was a need to increase the population after almost [ losing half the continent to the japanese ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brisbane_line ) , followed by it actually worked out really well for us , so we 've decided that we 're happy with multiculturalism . 
  edit : [ i should add that we subsidued/paid british subjects and europeans to move to australia for decades under the `` 10 pound pound pom '' scheme ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten_pound_poms ) for several decades after ww2 . 
  actually one of our recent pms julia gillard came to australia as a child from wales under the scheme when she was only 4 or 5 .

  well technically ` first world ' was the capitalist countries during the cold war , and ` second world ' was the communist countries during the cold war , so yes , poland was a ` second world ' country during the time in history when those terms still made sense . 
  since when did the eus parliament become a westminster system of government ? 
   irony - a situation that is strange or funny because things happen in a way that seems to be the opposite of what you expected . 
  so keeping with hundreds of years of the westminster system of parliament is unexpected how ? 
   if a foreign intelligence agency spies on our companies , citizens and politicians to be fair , most western governments are probably spying on other western countries . 
  [ well there was 2000 leaked reports on thursday , but i have n't bothered to read up on it much yet as i 'm waiting for the dust to settle ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/11/nauru-files-reveal-cases-of-alleged-sexual-violence-and-child-abuse-not-disclosed-to-parliament ) honestly though , i 've read worse happening between asylum seekers in europe in just the last month than anything being wrongly done to these people in any of the reports i 've read . 
  which is a different issue to the extreme amounts of psychological damage a lot of these people seem to have though , the self harm inflicted is painful to read ( which some people saying that the detention caused ) . 
  in canada and here in australia we have civil nationalism , which works well for our immigrant based countries and high per capita immigration rates . 
  personally i prefer it , but there was a transition period for australia from a more nativist/anglo-centric culture during the 20th century , to a civil nationalism culture based around values like `` mateship '' `` a fair go '' `` workers paradise '' `` the larakin aussie '' . 
  our of curiosity , with canada being much older than australia but settled by two distinct countries , did you have this transition as well , or have you always more or less had civil nationalism ? 
  but lets not ignore the elephant in the room , both our countries have group ( s ) based around nativism/ethnic nationalism , your first nation people , and our aboriginals . 
  now trasnfer that to a european context , where most europeans have been living in the same country , or a neighbouring country from before our countries were discovered by europeans . 
  it 's such a different issue to ` people just need to changed their values to civic nationalism instead of ethnic nationalism ' ; it 's not a demand we place on our native peoples , so part of me feels like it 's wrong to place that demand on what are technically the native people of europe . 
  i just do n't think many europeans are ready for full civic nationalism , and i do n't see that changing anytime soon . 
  he was saying that french people rank each other that way , not that they as an outside ranks them that way . 
   my complain is the lack of mechanisms to screen the real refugees there is the unhcr refugee resettlment program , unfortunately no european countries have joined it except for denmark , sweden , norway , the uk and in the last few years germany and france joined . 
  but france has a resettlement target of 100/year , and germany has 350/year . 
  as opposed to australia 13,000 / year . 
  the mechanism has been there since at-least the 50 's ( sweden joined in 1953 ) . 
   cooperation within eu to divide through europe well the eu is meant to be about common economic/trade policies , stepping into the realm of refugee resettlement and who gets to live/migrant into a country are a pretty giant overstep that they do n't have the democratic mandate for . 
  from your description , the role sounds more like an ombudsman or comissioner in the australian system ( i dont know what the role would be called in the uk ) . 
  the problem though with translating government job titles is every country is run differently and a title that conveys a description of the exact type of work done wo n't exist . 
  ` state secretary ' means nothing in australian english , so thankyou for the clarification . 
  surely this counts as a civil crime and there is no jail time for those ? 
  yea , english unfortunately is n't ( very ) phonetic , but due to it being spoken as a first language in so many countries , the range of acceptable/correct pronunciation is much much broader than any other european language . 
  yep , its the same in australia and canada . 
  parts of our ecosystems evolved in a way that wildfire is an essential part of life for many plants . 
  those are just claims , their is currently no hard evidence , and nothing that would hold up in court , in australia its innocent until proven guilty , and an accusation is n't proof . 
  personally i think a lot torture claims and other are exagurations/lies , but i reckon it is happening , and reading through the staff/medical reports that were released this week by the guardian was both heart breaking and terrifying . 
  its an absolute traversity that the media is kept out of nauru . 
  nauru is a tiny tiny pacific island nation with basically no economy outside of remitence payments and what we as australia pay them to host our refugees , sorry if they dont have the resources to demolish buildings instead of re-using them . 
  afaik there isnt any hard video/photo evidence yet , which could be due to the secrecy around the operations in nauru ( the whole reason for having these camps outside australia in another country or an island territory like christmas island is that they are n't protected by our laws ) or because the claims have been exaggerated . 
  if/when video evidence comes out , i think that will be a tipping point in australia to change our methods from what they are currently , but until then its an out of site out of mind issue . 
  ( all this happens thousands of km from any major population centre in australia ) . 
  claims have been exaggerated in the past from our offshore detention system , but there is a lot of secrecy ( with cross parliment support ) for what is going on in the camps . 
  we deffo spend a lot though , as this solution costs us about $ 500,000 / year/refugee , so the claims of concentration camp abuse are exagurated to most australians ears , but there is no media oversite so we also dont trust what our government and the nauru is telling us about how all these claims are exagurated . 
  [ we do/did so well because we started funding sports we were good at ( i.e. 
  swimming ) such a high rate and sending such a large delagation . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_summer_olympics ) , we actually sent 421 this year , only beated by brasil , germany and the usa . 
  we were rubbish until the mid 90s . 
  which is a bit silly considering that we are only 24 million people . 
  why are the ukranians blamed and not the soviets ? 
  surely it was the ussr calling the shots at that point in time ? 
  technically greenland is closer to europe than nauru is to australia aswell !, 
  [ yea , the australian services export is 35 billion pounds , so 21 billion surplus is actually kind of crap , ] ( https://www.google.com.au/search?q=16+aud+in+pounds&amp;oq=16+aud+in+pounds&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l3.4511j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=utf-8#q=62+aud+in+pounds ) in my opinion . 
  pretty sure australia and canada are aswell, 
  exactly , we are now richer and live longer and earn more than any averages or median measurements in the eu .
