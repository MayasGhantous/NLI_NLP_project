  or you know , continental european could also just not attempt a ww3 against the anglosphere and commonwealth again, 
  to be fair , it all comes down to negotiations between the uk and the eu and where they lead to determine the next step . 
  less than 5 % of the vote is counted so far , so were gon na get an avalanche of click bait articles from the british press until its decided . 
  fairfax , guardian , aim , the conversation , the abc , the saturday paper ... 
  we use the phrase `` is that true , or did you read it in the daily telegraph '' , we dont categorise it as a newspaper but as a tabloid and it has very low trust ratings . 
  ( which is only published in the state of nsw ) our most trusted news source is the abc our natioal broadcaster , which regularly has reviews of its journalistic integrity . 
  but yes , fuck murdoch , he owns pretty much all the print newspapers , and i have no doubt he uses it to try to swing elections , and was probably a key reason we had that dickhead tony abbot . 
  but we have many other news sources : abc , guardian , aim , the conversation , the saturday paper , sydney morning herald , the melbourne age none of which are owned by murdoch . 
  fisher ? 
  i think that 's one of the words that is spelt differently between traditional and simplified english, 
  would you mind elaborating ? 
  i meant open 3 weeks early , like we do in australia , not the opening hours of the day of the election , i should have explained that more clearly . 
  but you do n't have voting booths open to early vote ? 
  [ apparently 1/3 of voters are going to vote early in our election ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-experts-predict-up-to-one-third-of-voters-will-go-to-polls-early-20160529-gp6w42.html ) . 
  ( they open 3 weeks before and are open 9-5 every day ) . 
  [ both sides of the debate remind me of this 30 rock clip way to much ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fvuabknnow ) , which was a bit dissapointing as i know the uk has much better people to debate this topic . 
   furthermore , large swathes of the amazon are already being cut down to support europe 's addiction to beef . 
  should we now encourage this trend in africa as well ? 
  agreeing with everything in your post , but we avoided the issue of cutting down the amazon or other degradation processes of unsustainable practices through regulation of imports in australia as opposed to tariffs subsidies , it keeps us competitive and we make a motza off exporting to the asian middle class . 
  he said refugees not immigrants ? 
   so there should be an ` infrastructure ' that allows people to apply for asylum from abroad . 
  australia has this system . 
  we just use the unhcr to who process requests from the 14 million in unhcr refugee camps to get all our refugees , but very few european countries offer resettlement to refugees in refugee camps . 
  the infrastructure is already there , it just requires countries to sign up . 
  is pre-polling or postal voting a common thing on the uk for people that ca n't vote on the day ? 
  it 's the australian term for the 2008 crisis , i do n't think anyone else uses it . 
  whats the common term in europe for it ? 
  clearly the nobel prize was a swedish long term plot to undermine great britain then !, 
  honestly , i do n't get why people are putting short term economics over long term . 
  this is a decision for where britian will be in the next few decades , not just the next few years . 
  i 'm so pissed off about that piece of miss-information in the campaign . 
  we have a points based system , and quotas for each individual visa type . 
  our quotas are high because we are happy with having pretty much the highest per capita immigration in the world . 
  why on earth would the uk adopt our system and not use the quotas for individual visa types , or make them dramatically higher than australia on a per capita rate ? 
  but yes , our net immigration rate is roughly double the per capita rate of the uks . 
  [ we 've had a strong minimum wage for over a hundred years , which is raised above inflation every year , and all the award wages in our award wage system ( about 60 % of australian wage earners ) are indexed off it . 
  it 's $ 120/week higher than before the 2008 global financial crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minimum_wage_law#australia ) . 
  ( other wage earners are higher earners on individual contracts ) . 
  but if our economy was n't growing , or if we had deflation then wages wo n't go up . 
  [ it 's actually the highest in the world now in usd or 3rd in ppp . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_minimum_wages_by_country ) ( fairwork australia takes into consideration a variety of factors when deciding the wage rise each year , inflation and economic growth being two main factors ) . 
  [ we 've just had our lowest wage growth in over 2 decades and it 's 2 % ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/australia/wage-growth ) [ vs francethat has n't hit 1 % in over a decade ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/wage-growth ) . 
  you kind of need economic growth for a rise in wages mate . 
  [ so i went to the imf data and pulled up canada , nz , aus and the uk for 1996-2016 . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/hw7wajj ) australias gdp grew up * 186 % * canada grew by 134 % nz grew by : 146 % uk grew by : 118 % and apparently the eu economies only grew by 92.5 % ... and that 's before we bring up the ridiculous government debt of the uk and eu countries , and the negative/zero interest rates across the eurozone . 
  you have no reserve mechanism left for another global recession unlike aus/can/nz . 
  i did n't mean for this to come off as a pissing contest , but the eu is by far the sick man of the world economy . 
  are n't most european economies still on life support from a recession almost a decade ago ? 
  with most western european countries still not larger than 2008 ? 
  i 'm not quite sure what you mean by that , would you mind elaborating a bit for me ? 
  pretty useless infographic , it 's just a bunch of logos put under useless headlines `` other '' `` decentralized agencies '' . 
  where is the info part ? 
   unhcr used to whine about australian temporary protection visas . 
  yea , we stopped listening to them a while ago . 
  there are only two countries in the asia pacific accepting refugees , [ australia and nz . 
  australia resettles the second highest amount from refugee camps ] ( http://imgur.com/uqtrkwb ) , and [ the highest per capita . ] ( https://theconversation.com/factcheck-does-australia-take-more-refugees-per-capita-through-the-unhcr-than-any-other-country-47151 ) . 
  if they wanted to do something useful , they 'd start talking to the several developed east asian countries in the asia pacific with arguable higher standards of living than us . 
  do n't give the refugees permanent residency , and instead just keep renewing their refugee visas until their home country is safe to return to . 
   not sure whether being a squatter is a better career than being a polish nun ... its not like i 've looked up their wages . 
  but at least now she can have her own hobo family and hobo kids , which i actually think is an improvement . 
   if it makes you feel any better , some people are calling us racist whatever we do . 
  everything is racist , we 've just embraced that everyone thinks we 're racist and turned it into a joke . 
  it 's rather confronting for outsiders initially , but we see ourselves as the most successful multicultural country so we do n't care about other peoples opinions . 
  what i mean by this is that we embrace the fact that we all have different ethnic and cultural backgrounds and make blatantly racist jokes about it all the time , it 's part of our whole ` nothing is taboo ' culture , which means people do n't feel the requirement to abandon their home culture as it 's talked about and discussed and learned from all the time ; as opposed to `` let 's ignore that they are from a completely different background , and silently assume they will realise our culture is superior and become just like us '' , and nothing breaks the ice on an issue than a dry joke . 
  we 've been called racist by the unhcr , the australian refugee council , most of our regional neighbours ( none of whom accept refugees except nz , including all the developed east asian countries ) , etc. 
  but , meh , we 're with nz wealthier , live longer , are more multicultural and have better protections for individuals than any other country in the asia-pacific . 
  so i did some digging ( resettling refugees making up 5-10 % of our immigration is something we 've been doing since ww2 , so it 's not something i 've ever really researched before ) , and i was actually quite surprised at how few european countries have offered to resettle people and that it 's only a recent thing for them ( besides the nordics ) and that they accept so few !, 
  [ we 've been resettling people with the unhcr since 1977 , with a yearly tarket currently of 11,000 ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3c5e542d4.html ) ( but i should add their numbers are a few years out of date for australia , it 's currently 13,500 per year , and a one time 20,000 syrian refugee intake ) . 
  [ where as germany has only been participating since 2012 , and only aims to resettle 300 people ... ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/5162b3bc9.html ) [ where as france has been doing it since 2008 , and has such lofty goals of 100 ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/5322ca479.html ) [ canada 1978 started resettling , takes 13800/year ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3c5e55594.html ) . 
  [ denmark started in 1979 and takes 500/year ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3c5e55594.html ) [ sweden 1950 , and takes 1,900 / year ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/3c5e5a219.html ) [ for an impartial break down with statistics , you can read our parliament houses summary of the issues ( it 's the closest thing to an impartial source for this information that i can find/think of ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/rp/rp1415/refugeeresettlement ) . 
  the table at the bottom os very illuminating : [ the following table shows the number of refugees who were resettled in 2012 ( assisted by unhcr ) ] ( http://imgur.com/uqtrkwb ) i honestly did n't realise that most european countries did n't resettle refugees or that the numbers were so low or let them in before this recent crisis , and to think people call us racist and give you all a free pass . 
  edit : said that our refugee target was 1,100 , when it 's actually 11,000 . 
   applications should be possible through embassies and refugee camps they already are available in refugee camps and have been for decades , it 's where we get all our refugees from . 
  there are millions of genuine refugees in these camps , preference should be given to them instead of those wealthy enough to pay for people smugglers imo . 
  [ because someone in this thread will inevitable mention the australian method of border protection , our pm yesterday was on qanda justifying our policy to a refugee that has been in detention for 3 years . 
  the video link is probably geo locked ( but the youtube version that comes out about a week after the show has aired is n't ) so i 'll include the transcript . 
  ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s4463065.htm ) go to 47:43 . 
  behrouz boochani : i 'm talking to you from manus prison . 
  australia exiled me here by force three years ago . 
  what is my crime ? 
  i am a refugee who fled injustice , discrimination and persecution . 
  i did n't leave my family by choice . 
  why am i still in this illegal prison after three years ? 
  ( applause ) malcolm turnbull : well , tony , as you know , and i 'm not sure whether - i suspect our - your correspondent from manus island ca n't see this but i do n't know anything about his personal circumstances . 
  tony jones : i can tell you just a few things . 
  malcolm turnbull : sure . 
  okay . 
  tony jones : because we did take ... malcolm turnbull : good . 
  tony jones : we found - we got the question and we tried to find out who he is . 
  he 's an iranian kurdish journalist who fled his country to avoid imprisonment for his writing . 
  he 's had a preliminary assessment from png immigration department saying he does meet the criteria to be recognised as a refugee but , as he says , he 's been detained for three years on manus . 
  can you offer him any hope that he will be released from there ? 
  malcolm turnbull : well , if he - if he - again , i do n't - i 'd - look , i 'd rather not comment on this particular case but let me hypothesise a little bit . 
  a person who has been found to be given refugee status in png is able to then seek - is enabled then to settle in png . 
  they , i know - i 'm sure that he would rather come to australia , but that option is not available to him . 
  we have learnt the tragic truth that when the very strict and clear border protection policies of the howard government were , despite our urgings not to do so , undone by kevin rudd , we had 50,000 unlawful arrivals . 
  we had 1,200 deaths at sea of which we know . 
  it was a catastrophe . 
  now , we have been able to restore the security on the border . 
  the people smugglers are out of business .
