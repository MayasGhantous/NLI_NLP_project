   eu decisions for the most part are joint decisions by the 28 heads of state . 
  exactly , they are no longer directly in the hands of british politicians elected by british people . 
  one good example of where the uk has lost sovereignty that affected my country australia is that the uk can no longer create it 's own trade deals , when the uk joined the initial eu trade barriers went up between the uk and australia that were n't there previously and the uk ca n't do anything about it . 
  currently , if australia wants a free trade deal with the uk or if the uk wants a free trade deal with australia , we need to negotiate with 28 other countries to achieve this , and not just the uk and australia . 
  this is effectively a loss of sovereignty over trade . 
  whether or not this is a good enough reason to leave the eu is n't something i personally care about that much tbh , [ why would we want to flood our market with british good anyway . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ebfxjsfaxq ) , but eu membership does come at a cost of sovereignty . 
  it all started in 2001 when we had our first xenophobic/anti-immigrant party form called `` one nation '' started complaining about asians and immigrants and boat arrival refugees ( they have only ever achieved one seat in one election ) . 
  the then conservative government of john howard to stop loosing votes on the right instead started this [ 15 year saga of border protection policy we have been through . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution ) in short , it 's based around the principle of [ `` we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come '' . 
  ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2001/s422692.htm ) we turn back all the boats to indonesia when they are in international waters , and if they enter our waters or need to be rescued then we put them in indefinite detention in off shore processing centres ( in our island territory of christmas island and we pay the country of nauru to host a processing centre ) while we `` process '' their refugee claims . 
  [ `` arrivals dropped from a total of 5516 people in 2001 to 1 arrival in 2002 after implementation of the policy , and remained below 150 annually until 2008 '' ] ( http://www.aph.gov.au/about_parliament/parliamentary_departments/parliamentary_library/pubs/bn/2011-2012/boatarrivals ) what happens when they are found to be genuine refugees ? 
  well we need to double check that and check it again , then we ask them if they want to be shipped to their home country instead , then we check their claims again . 
  eventually the word got out and the people smugglers were put out of business , and now the refugees just pile up in other south east asian countries that now have to actually deal with it instead of just ushering them further down to australia . 
  ( note , the source countries for the refugees is the middle east and north africa like europe ) . 
  [ here 's a graph of the number of people arriving over time ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pacific_solution#/media/file:boatarrivals.gif ) , which tracts the changes in legislation ( which happened each time after we had a change of government ) . 
  they have the option of creating a normal free trade treaty like the usa , can and aus are negotiating with the eu , when those are signed we wo n't get freedom of movement with the eu we 'll just get reduced tariffs which is all the british really need . 
  but if the uk did leave the eu it would regain it 's ability to create it 's own free trade deals , and i highly doubt that the anglosphere and the commonwealth would let the uk stagnate behind trade barriers , it 's not in our interests to have an economically depressed uk . 
  currently , we do have trade barriers with the uk due to the eus protectionist tariff barriers . 
  honestly , if australia was faced with the prospect of surrendering it 's sovereignty or loosing some foreign investment for a while , we 'd go with loosing some foreign investment for a while . 
  i do n't think it 's a very strong argument that some rich people decided to pull their money out , it was theirs to begin with and they could pull it out at any time they wanted . 
  there are good arguments on either side of the debate , but a short term reduction in foreign investment is n't one of them . 
  only by ceding from the union , which comes with the threat of tariffs, 
  for comparison : [ india : 1.7 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth ) [ australia : 1.1 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/australia/gdp-growth ) [ china : 1.1 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth ) [ mexico : 0.8 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/mexico/gdp-growth ) [ eurozone : 0.6 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/gdp-growth ) [ canada :0.6 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/canada/gdp-growth ) [ south korea :0.5 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/south-korea/gdp-growth ) [ uk :0.4 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/gdp-growth ) [ usa : 0.2 ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth ) 0.6 for the euro area is the the best they 've had for several years , and it 's still pretty low compared to other economies . 
  since when was becoming a doctor or educated a fucked up life choice ? 
  in australia we only have a state pension for the `` poor '' ( the means testing is very generous , so 80 % of age eligible people get it ) , and everyone employed in any manner including casual/temo/partime / fulltime etc has an employer contribution to their super account ( similar to a 401 ( k ) ) of 9.5 % since 1992 and it stacks up to give an average retirement super of aud $ 1.6 million . 
  there is talk of raising it to 12 % though . 
  i 'm in my 20 's and most ( i can think of 2 that have less , but that 's because they pursued a very bohemian lifestyle ) of my friends my age have at least 100k . 
  my brother is 33 in his 30 's has over 600k already . 
  15 % is probably a bit ` excessive ' by only a few percentage points . 
  edit : australians collectively now have [ 2 trillion in super ] ( https://www.superannuation.asn.au/resources/superannuation-statistics ) , which is about 130 % of our gdp , so we 've effectively dodged the the level of economic threat pension issue facing european countries into the future . 
   what about the british criminals they ca n't get rid of ? 
  but if they are n't british , they did n't grow up and become who they are in your system and culture , so why should brits have to put up with their fucked up life choices ? 
  denmark , there 's a good chance that i would be born to a poor family instead of a rich one , so id prefer to be born in a society where that does n't matter as much . 
   the head of the government should be a directly elected president i 'd love to watch that election with so many languages across the eu , there 's no way someone would get elected without speaking least all the major languages of the eu . 
  i ca n't help but draw parallels to australia journey of federation when i think about the eu coalescing into a single nation . 
  australia 6 colonies only federated for 3 main reasons : bring tariffs to zero between the colonies ( like the eu ) , create a single army and border for the nation for border protection ( like schengen in the sense that we created one border instead of 6 ) , and to control immigration ( which draws a parallel to the current refugee crisis where people are looking to the eu for answers more so than their own national governments ! ) . 
  initially , our federal government did n't really collect any revenue and do much at all , we did n't have our own currency until 10 years after federation ( went from rum for the first 50 years , to the british pound after that , then to the australian pound in 1910 to years after federation which was pegged to the british pound ) . 
  we did n't have australian citizenship until 1949 ( we were all british citizens ) . 
  we had very different levels of economic prosperity around the country ( like the eu ) with melbourne being the richest city in the british empire at federation , and many people living something close to subsistence lifestyles on farms well away from civilisation . 
  so with the eu creating its own currency , having a parliament , collecting taxation , having it 's own citizenship , in lots of ways it has accelerated much faster towards a single nation state than australia federation did ( in the sense that very few people considered themselves `` australian '' ( i.e. 
  an `` eu citizen '' ) at 1901 , and instead considered themselves as citizens of the empire ( i.e. 
  a hungarian/finnish/german ) . 
  if the eu does coalesce into a nation state , i do n't think it 'll be in the next decade , but i 'm sure i 'll see it in my lifetime . 
  it already has so many of the trappings of a nation state , and has progressed so far beyond just a trade block - it 's such a different beast to the free trade agreement between aus and nz that includes freedom of movement . 
  correlation ! = causation . 
  you ca n't just pick a wealthy country and something they do and claim that is what must have caused their wealth without providing some sort of mechanism to connect the two . 
  by that logic i could say that as australia has higher incomes and median and average levels of wealth than any eu country and has had 25 years of uninterrupted growth , but our local government does n't really do anything much more interesting than repairing roads and organising trash collection , where as our federal government collects 80 % of tax revenue and controls most areas that the secret to wealth and in australia and therefore for the eu is to put all the power and decision making at the top . 
  when really it 's probably more to do with trade policies such as digging up the country as fast as we possible can and selling it all of to china and india and capitalizing off their incredible strong growth and historically unprecedented resource prices . 
  [ well according the the linked report ] ( http://www.globalslaveryindex.org/index/ ) the netherlands does have the highest proportion of slaves after portugal and italy , and 5 times the per capita rate of most western european countries . 
  though i imagine these sorts of statistics are extremely guestimated and should be taken with a very large serving of salt . 
   iraq , afghanistan , syria these are the main source countries for the refugees coming by boat to australia as well . 
   you do n't get to pick and choose refugees that come from war torn countries . 
  you can not deport them back to where they came from . 
  you do get to choose which of the 14 million refugees growing up in refugee camps you bring in though , and i think it 's better to help them first . 
  there is only so much that any country can do in this issue , but over loading in one year and then going a fast as it can down to zero that europe while cutting funding and aid to those refugee camps is doing is doing a bigger disservice to more people . 
  europeans are clearly loosing faith in their refugee programs because they do n't have the oversight that the australian and canadian and usas programs do , which means that less people get help . 
   ecthr i 'll admit i got this confused and made a mistake with the un human rights body that was complaining about australia , i 'm not that familiar with the judicial system of the eu and just assumed it was an acronym for the un body that i did n't know . 
  there are quite a few similarities and quite a few differences between the european and the australian refugee crises that i think deserved to be pointed out . 
  there are no refugee generating countries anywhere even vaguely near australia , the source for all these people coming by boat was the india region and the middle east , so there never really was any need for us to take anyone else in as they were n't actually fleeing anything ; indonesia while not as developed as germany , is n't a terrible place to live , and ranks third after australia and nz for freedom of hte press and democracy in the region . 
  on the other hand , eu is actually surrounded by several active war zones ( ukraine , syria , libya ) severe famine and overpopulation , there are n't any real transition countries between the eu and these zones besides turkey and the mediterranean . 
  also , nauru is so bloody far away from australia and from where the refugees were coming by boat from/to ( usually to christmas island as its only 500 km from indonesia and an australian territory , even if it is 1500 km from the mainland ) , that something out in the atlantic or off norway would be a more accurate comparison to nauru than anything in the mediterranean . 
  ( christmas island is about 7000km away from nauru ) . 
  also , i think it 's worth pointing out that [ australia has the highest per capita resettlement rate of refugees from refugee camps ] ( https://theconversation.com/factcheck-does-australia-take-more-refugees-per-capita-through-the-unhcr-than-any-other-country-47151 ) ; and because we know that these people are genuinly in need there is much good will to them so we get families and mothers with no living husbands and with children , unlike the european solution of letting people smugglers decide who is most in need results in a bunch of angry 20 year old guys , and then leads to borders shutting down and then nobody gets helped at all !, 
  we also start their cultural orientation and language training programs for them in the refugee camps , we explain what our values are ( women and men equal , this is a koala , do n't pet it ... etc ) along with a whole host of other things . 
  we 've been resettling refugees on mass since ww2 into australia without any real issues . 
   you mean the only way to obtain refugee status is if you applied in the embassy where your country is ? 
  that 's not how it works . 
  that 's not how any of it works . 
  apply for refugee status in a unhcr refugee camp , it 's where australia gets all it 's refugees from and we have the highest resettlement rate per capita . 
  i think it 's a much more human solution as it increases the trust of the public in the system which has lead to higher refugee intakes , and it does n't put your selection criteria in the hands of people smugglers ; instead we help those most in need . 
  a single mum with no husband and three kids , as opposed to the european method of self selecting for a bunch of 20 year old guys and ignoring the truly desperate , overloading the public and decreasing trust in the system and then locking everyone else out . 
  europe took the lazy selfish solution , not the one that helps those most in need or helps the most people . 
   that 's how you get your country condemned by the echr . 
  yea , this happened to us in australia , nobody cares . 
   there is no nauru in the mediterranean yea , but if you look at where nauru is on the map , it 's a good 2000km + from the coast , and more like 3000km + from any sizable population on mainland australia . 
  the canary islands or something else in the atlantic would be a more appropriate corollary to using nauru than anything in the mediterranean . 
  also , where the refugees where going to was christmas island ( an australian territory ) which is 1500 km from australia and only 500km from indonesia , but christmas island is about 7000 km from nauru . 
  you do realise he 's just using really dry humour to troll you all right ? 
   the eu is more than five times the trade with all 52 commonwealth countries combined [ do n't blame us because we do n't want to buy british made ] ( https://youtu.be/1ebfxjsfaxq?t=55s ), 
   the so called eu bureaucracy has less civil servants than the city of hamburg i 've heard this before , but it just seems so confusing , surely more people are needed to run the eu than to run the city of hamburg ? 
  we were n't always the most urbanised country , but we modernised away from `` living off the sheeps back '' and opened our markets to trade and lowered subsidies and tariffs . 
  [ by 1971 nearly two-thirds of australians lived in the metropolitan capital cities . 
  between 1971 and 1976 . 
  ] ( https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/fn%20118%20-%20hugo,%20changing%20patterns%20of%20population%20and%20distribution.pdf ) ( page 7 ), 
  to be fair , you have a very confusing system to explain your tariffs for an outsider , but piecing together : [ however , it was established that for the major cereals ( common wheat , durum wheat , barley , maize , rye and sorghum ) the import price , including customs duties , should not be lower than 155 % of 101.31 $ / t ( ceiling system ) . 
  to this end variable duties , which can never be higher than the bound tariffs in the table , were introduced for these commodities ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cereals/factsheet-cereals_en.pdf ) ( page 6 ) . 
  [ and piecing together from here the offical eu data on grain prices in the eu , lets take an average grain value of 150 ] ( https://circabc.europa.eu/sd/a/67ed6377-a661-4621-9c8a-89f6da197e3f/2015-07-15_import%20duties%202015-16.pdf ) [ and the tarrif values were about , lets say 180 ] ( https://circabc.europa.eu/sd/a/67ed6377-a661-4621-9c8a-89f6da197e3f/2015-07-15_import%20duties%202015-16.pdf ) , that gives a tarric value of about ** 120 % ** for grain . 
  it 's more the the extreme levels of subsidisation though : ( from one of the submission papers to the aus-eu free trade agreement ) [ eu grain producers benefit from significant subsidies in production which undermine australia 's competitive position in the market even further . 
  eu grain producers operate in a productive market where the producer support equivalent is still more than ** 18 % ** while australia 's is less than ** 2.3 % ** - page 2 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cereals/factsheet-cereals_en.pdf ), 
  yes , on a continent as large as europe we deffo have no rural areas , everyone is within a 2 hour drive of sydney ... wait , is n't it europe with cities everywhere and australia with a huge isolated rural areas and a boom-bust cycle caused by non-regular weather patterns ? 
  we did have a major transition period in the 80s when we modernised and liberalised our trade , the result has been stronger growth and lower prices and higher incomes . 
  or we could have continues with our protectionist method and been the poorest anglo country . 
  i found the blog and then article your graph was from , but i could n't find a more recent one unfortunately . 
  they said they were going to do that study every 3 years but i ca n't find any later editions unfortunately . 
  yes , but a lot has happened since 2007 , e.g. 
  australia has signed free trade agreements with china , japan and korea , reducing our effective tariffs to zero ( down from apparently 90 % of what the eus tarrifs were in 2007 ) , creating markets for our products for the growing middle class of east asia , i.e. 
  australian agriculture is much less tariffed than eu agriculture in all food importing markets , meaning we get the cash . 
  the british on the other hand ca n't create these free trade agreements as a member of the eu , and the eu has failed at making any meaningful free-trade agreements outside of its self . 
  furthermore about the tariffs/subsidies , [ australian farmers are some of the least subsidised sided in the world ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-14/malcolm-turnbull-correct-on-farmers-subsidies/5252596 ) , unlike european farmers who who are subsidised to the hilt which distorts the global market .
