  it 's a suprisinly hard thing to catch , in [ the recent 7/11 under payment scandal in australia ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/interactive/2015/7-eleven-revealed/ ) , part of the under paying was by having people pay back half their wage after being paid the legal wage , it was a mutally beneficial system for the employer and employee that they opted in to . 
  [ then you have people accepting sub par positions , and paying for sponsorship ( which leads to citizenship ) ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/business/retail/dominos-scandal-franchisees-selling-visas-20170211-guau8x.html ) , it 's a complicated issue , and because the people it affects are either low paid or unemployeed , the rest of society tends not to care ; unless they get an opportunity to vote for something like brexit it seems . 
  mexico uses real sugar , where the usa is stuck with corn syrup . 
   my admittedly naive question is , how are employers allowed to pay less than minimum wage ? 
  cash in hand . 
  for example , the minimum wage is $ aud17 .5 / hr , but employers will offer to pay someone $ aud12/hr cash in hand ( so it 's off the books ) . 
  the migrant employer does n't go to the authorities cos now he has a job , and the employer does n't tell the authorities because then he would be fined . 
  but the rest of society is left with less tax revenue , and one less job available for somone doing the right thing . 
   european countries by themselves are far too small for the world , even the biggest/strongest of them . 
  when this point get brought up , i always wonder how we managed to do it in spite of not being in any union at all , and why then britain needs to be in a union , they are 3 times the population of australia after all . 
   no , trump , you do not have the political capital to be treating australia like shit , so do n't do it , or you 're out . 
  bannon knows that ( the evil wizard behind the throne ) . 
  the predominant view in australia re : the phone hang up scandal , he probably thought our `` liberal '' government was left wing and went a bit crazy ( both parties will toe the line with the usa , for now ) , when they are our right wing party ( for australia ) , as trump got turned around within 24 hours . 
  i think during that a poll got released saying australia was the usa most reliably ally for republican voters . 
  all in all , a complete wtf , ok it 's over before it began , lets move on situation . 
   defense spending and truly staggering sums spent on scientific r&d from all stripes to put numbers to it , us defence spending is like usd$ 600 billion ( that 's like 40 % of our gdp , or 4 % for the usa !, 
  ) , there is no way anyone can come close to us defence contracts , and what they offer funding wise , and thats before you even talk about the research or uni sector !, 
  to be fair , trump is n't the biggest political upset for the alliance , and i doubt he has the ability to be it even if he wanted . 
  pretty much . 
  it would be nice if we could just do our own thing like the usa , but we are lacking a few hundred million people , that 's why we piggy back on the usa just like canada , and nz ( i assume about nz ... 
  i have no idea ) and everyone else . 
  which is hilarious when you consider nasas budget is only 18 billion , something we could afford ourselves , or at least collectively afford between can nz and aus . 
  but i guess a lot of nasas funding comes form ancillary benefits like research program funding from unis/think tanks and the such , which is something our economies obviously ca n't match . 
  i blame the organisers , they mixed up austria and australia and the invitations got sent to the wrong people ( extremely awkward as austria was hosting ) , and ran with it saying we were ` invited for a special anniversary ' to save face . 
  ^ please ^ let ^ us ^ stay ^ we ^ love ^ eurovision ^ a ^ lot . 
   germany has a set of 30 + federal research institutes well i 'll have you know we rank as one of the worst countries for collaboration between industry and unis in the oecd ... we have problems . 
  but as a top down federation , everything comes from our federal level , so most research resources are pooled via the csiro . 
  i 'm not aware of any ranking for research outcomes by country , but we probably do poorly , and as i understand the uk does exceptionally well . 
  why are you asking ? 
  wan na figure out if he is a good nazi ally to help you conquer europe by bike ? 
  we 're in eurovision , australian news now covers europolitics for half the year and we are onto you nazis !, 
  / s it 's obviously an insult , but if most of the world 's crazy leaders are insulting you , you 're probably doing the right thing . 
  worst case scenario , you are n't living under a fellow crazy pants . 
  [ these people live on a literally worn-out continent , how are they building these cities . 
  honestly , most aussies are baffled by how well we do in international rankings and think they are loaded unfairly to our favour . 
  to be fair , if anything we championed multiculturalism . 
  after ww2 the policy was ` populate or perish ' , which led to immigration diversifying from outside the uk to the white commonwealth ( 1940s ) , and then europe ( 1950s and 60s ) , and then the rest of the world ( 70s ) . 
  we now proudly label ourselves as ` the most successful multicultural country . 
   for educational advancement for more of it 's citizens than any nation on earth , including the us well now we have uncapped places at unis now , so the unis can enroll as many people as they want , and the government pays ( about 60 % ) and the rest is taken as an interest free loan by the student , if anything , we have the highest uni enrollment now than we have ever had , and one of the highest levels of uni degrees for gen x and y in the world ( i think canada is higher than us ) . 
   i 've been surprised to see some australian cited in some obscure crystallography paper or the like i think university of sydney is ranked 8th in the world for humanities ? 
  and higher for melbourne ? 
  i do n't know how they do it everywhere else , but in australia we tend to look at the ranking of the relevant department , and not care about the uni ranking overall . 
   ts not like the uk , germany , eu etc. . do n't have national , regional & defence research organisations too i honestly do n't have any idea and i 'm rather curious , what are they called so i can google them ? 
  but as i understand it , the intake of the ivy league is pretty low as a % of the american population , even in state . 
  for example as to what i was comparing , the univeristy of sydney takes in 15,000 undergrad per year and their are only about 40,000 undergraduates per year in the state ( this compliments the university of nsw in sydney which takes in 10,000 students a year ) ( both are go8 ) , and the same situation applies in melbourne . 
  sydney and melbourne are 40 % of our population . 
  it 's not a stretch to say most aussie undergrads go toe go8 uni which are all in the top 100 , if anything , its closer to 75 % than 50 % , but i ca n't be fucked running the numbers . 
  true on both counts . 
  but to be fair for the australian context ( and i 'm curious as to how this is in europe , do most countries have a government research organisation ? ), 
  our main research organisation is the csiro ( commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation ) which does the bulk of the research and it 's not the unis ( though it is often in collaboration ) , so naturally we would rank lower in uni research outcomes . 
  but to be fair , the top us universities take in very few students out of their population , and most americans do n't get to attent a uni in the top 100 . 
  atleast this is how we look at it in australia - even though we only have a few unis in the top 100 ( 6 or 8 i think ? 
  ) , they take in most of the uni student cohort every year , i imagine its similar accross europe to australia in this regard . 
  also , those rankings are based on research output and mostly irellevant to student outcomes which is the main job of unis now days . 
  oi , stop stealing our regional dictators to struggle against , the philippines is clearly closer to australia and should be ours to be scared about ` opposition ' from . 
  bloody euros , claiming the whole planet again / s,

  so by accepting this money , they void the right to ever seek refuge in the future ? 
  just because they may not be an actual refugee now and just an economic migrant , does n't meant they wont have reason to be a refugee in the future . 
  it 's not like the regions around europe look to be getting significantly more stable any time soon after all . 
  why are n't they deported now then ?
