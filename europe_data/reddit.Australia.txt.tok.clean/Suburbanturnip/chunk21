  `` treat british emigrants to the eu like non-eu migrants '' means that they do n't think british people emmigrating into the eu should get special treatment over immigrants to the eu that are n't from europe .

  [ well the 25 % youth unemployment in france ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/france/youth-unemployment-rate ) is the starkest differencw between young british voters and young french voters , vs [ 12.4 % in the uk ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/youth-unemployment-rate ) , and thats before looking at underemployment which i reckin would also be high in france . 
  further , assuming there are tensions between native french and muslim immigrants and their descendants , those would be much more in the lives of young french people due to the higher than replacement rate of muslim immigrants . 
  it all hints at a lot of economic stress of the younger generation being ignored by the older generation in france . 
  this is exactly how the discussion will go in australia as well , if charles becomes king we most likely will become a republic in a year or two , if it 's william , we do n't for several decades . 
   mind that this is n't for state elections , but for an entire country with a population of 17 million . 
  yea i guess i should have been clear , i was referring to a federal election in australia , each state gets 12 senators regardless of population size and those are decided on a proportional representation basis in each state . 
  so its easier to get a senate seat from the lowest population state ( australia is 24 million ) . 
  out of curiosity , am i correct in understanding that if you vote for a party that does n't get 0.67 % then your vote disappears and does n't matter ? 
  does the party you vote for get some public funding even if they do n't reach the 0.67 % threshhold ? 
  you only need 25,000 votes ( 0.1 % of the australian population ) ( via preference flows , votes do n't disappear in the australian system , they just go to your second preference ) to get a senate seat in the state of tasmania in australia in the recent double dissolution election ? 
  ( as opposed to about 320,000 in the same election for the largest state nsw ) .

   not to mention that lull in wilders and afd polls all american mediasare claiming to be result of trump policy ... 
  i ca n't say for europe , but in the australian context i think it definitely showed people that were going to vote for the far right populist parties that they ca n't solve shit . 
  one nation only got about 5 % of the vote when they were polling at 15 % before trump was inaugurated ( in the state of western australia were we had an election this week ), 
   it was n't russia that politicized this event well russia did invade a ukraine , does n't get much more politicized than that .

  also , older voters tend to be more conservative in the anglosphere and have less qualifications ( which is reported as less educated ) ; as it was n't as necessary in the past to get them as it is today .

  to be fair , a diplomat dieing is a very rare occurrence , i do n't think an australian diplomat has ever died on the job , and it 's probably the same for most countries . 
  the fact that 6 have died in such a short time is just really odd . 
  my guess would be that the conservatives/republicans/liberals are the right wing party and party of the baby boomers , so the counter culture to that would be the left wing for millenials/gen x. 
  so to fix the issues in our societies , the younger generations in the anglosphere are voting opposite to their parents who got them into this mess , where european politics are more left wing in continental europe , so the counter culture vote is fn/adf ... etc.

   in previous years , we were inclined to believe that australia led switzerland in terms of median wealth due to higher wealth inequality in switzerland . 
  based on the available data -- which are quite limited -- we now think that swiss inequality is not so different from other european countries , and that its median wealth is higher than previously reported . 
  the revised estimate of usd 244,000 for median wealth per adult now places switzerland in first place , ahead of australia ( usd 163,000 ) , belgium ( usd 155,000 ) , new zealand ( usd 136,000 ) and norway ( usd 135,000 ) .

  finland was n't a country at the time and was n't the first country to give women the vote , that was new zealand in 1893 , but if we are recognising semi independent regions of countries , then the colony of south australia definitely beat finland in giving universal suffrage in 1894 ( but property owning women got the vote as early as 1861 in south australia ) . 
  * blushes *, 
  me too thanks, 
  go be fair , the colony of south australia was the first place in the world to grant women the vote ( 1895 ) and this right was extended to all races , including the natives .

  she won 4 senate seats in the last federal election ( out of 76 ) and is polling at 23 % in queensland ( the australian equivalent of bravaria i guess ) and they have a state election this year . 
  it will be the first time in forever it seems a non labor of liberal party controls is forced into coallotion in a state in australia in a generation or two . 
  besides the greens being in coalition in tasmania ( i guess tasmania is the australia equivalent of bremen , being such a small population base of our federation ; but they get 12 senators like every other state - i do n't know how senators are distributed in germany ),
