  about 25 % of australians were born overseas , and another 25 % are first generation immigrants . 
  the us/can/nz all have similar statistics . 
  [ this map might give you a better idea of what i 'm poorly trying to express  ( http://www.sbs.com.au/news/map/where-australias-immigrants-were-born-sydney ) , and we embraced their food cultures because they were tastier . 
  european cuisine is just generally less spicy because spicer plants did n't evolve there unlike other parts of the world , and yes , the empires did bring spices back to europe , but these countries already had established and diverse food cultures . 
  side questions : is it common to have a china town district in european cities ? 
  more or less what was n't under soviet control in the cold war . 
  the anglosphere has a lot of migrants from india and east asia , as we 're all multicultural immigrant countries . 
  asians tend to have hotter spicier food than europeans ( i guess hungarians are the exception ? 
  i 've had some typical hungarians dishes at hungarian restaurants here in sydney and always found them to be lacking in the spicy department ) . 
  they brought their food cultures with them , so we became used to spicer asian foods over time , and it became part of our identities e.g. 
  [ kylie kwong is one of our countries favourite chefs and the mother of chinese-australian cuisine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kylie_kwong ) . 
  specifically , most early migrants from china are cantonese , which arguable has the spiciest food culture in china along with sichuan . 
  in australia in the 60 's and 70 's when we became more affluent and going out for dinner became commonplace for most families , chinese food was one of the main choices due to its relative cheapness and awesome tastiness . 
  when we go to europe , there is noticeable a smaller asian population , and terrible asian food by comparison to back home , and the food tends to be less spicy than what we are used too . 
  hmm , i guess for the us it 's more about the mexican influence in their food , which does n't exist in australia . 
  tl ; dr : lot 's of asians ancestry migrants here , they have awesome food , it 's where all the spices come from except for pepper and paprika . 
   since oz and the us now count as europe , who do i talk to to get my free german money ? 
  if someone just leaves their towel on the beach and walks away for hours , why do n't people just steal their towels ? 
   ou could auction them and provide a more-efficient market for the limited resource !, 
  uber for beach towel spots ? 
   as far as i understand it , australia pivoted towards the us after the war precisely because they understood that we were in no position to protect them this is is close the the narrative we were taught in australia , but instead we saw it as a betrayal as many australians and kiwis fought and died in ww1 and ww2 in europe and africa , but we were left to fight against the japanese by ourselves . 
  ` fortress ' singapore was lost in a day , and japan captured the entirety of east asia , and bombed the americans out being able to enter the war , as we understood it in australia at the time this left australians and new zealanders alone to defend against the advancing japanese that had otherwise seemed impossible to stop . 
  if they could conquer a country as large as china , what could us 8 million antipodeans do ? 
  in the end , we fought a guerilla war in papua new guinea , and were retreating from the top half of australia to surrender it to the japanese ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brisbane_line ) and then the americans came out of nowhere and pushed the japanese back . 
  meanwhile australians were still fighting and dying in europe to defend england . 
  after ww2 we realised we could n't rely on the commonwealth , or the empire , or the uk to protect australia . 
  people stopped calling themselves and considering themselves as citizens of the empire ( a common term in the 1930 's ) . 
  we dramatically increased immigration from anywhere people would come and have been allies with america and gone to every war with them ever since . 
  fast forward to today , and the japanese have been our biggest trading partners for decades and we get along well , but we still do n't trust the uk . 
  we like the uk , we share a similar culture and set of values , we just do n't trust you . 
  it makes up a large part of why the concept of the uk leaving the eu and turning to the commonwealth instead makes the brits look delusional . 
  do n't get me wrong though , if the uk needed a bail-out to avoid a greek style default situation , we 'd chuck all the money we could at you , or if it was under military threat again we 'd be there ~ even if only to have a fall back lol for when we lose the ashes . 
  i do n't get why people just do n't steal the towels . 
  oh c'mon now , even the most brain dead american could give you a vague description of the cold war . 
  lets not bash americans just for the sake of it . 
  it makes me feel so sad that this is probably the reality millions of russians today :(, 
   in all impartiality ... to be fair . 
  ftfy, 
  yes , as an australian i 'm aware that big countries have the material resources for self-sufficiency . 
  but iron ore & crude oil = / = jet fuel and steel beams , and many components are usually manufactured in a large variety of countries , with ip from an even large spread of countries , surely russia is n't self sufficient for it 's entire military supplies ? 
  is russia self sufficient for its military 's supplies ? 
  are raw materials/finished products imported , and are the sanctions hurting that ? 
  the definition of a eurocentric poll . 
  when turkish-muslims use the term ` non-religious ' do they mean atheists ? 
  or is it the turkish-muslim equivalent of only going to church at christmas/easter ? 
  i noticed it in some other threads . 
  dam that islamic pope !, 
  that sounds disturbingly similar to what we do with possums . 
  no , and if you have a particularly ` pretty ' / ` elegant ; cursive font , it can be quite slow in comparison to spaced-out writing . 
  lot 's of people ca n't necessarily read everyones different cursive ` fonts/personal styles , i stopped writing cursive in highschool because not everyone can read it/read it well , so i did n't want to risk a marker not understanding something i wrote or skipping over a sentence/word , and i always managed to be one of the people who could write down the most under exam conditions . 
  it 's generally faster and prettier , but many people have problems reading it now days ( due to it being a bit harder to read and/or people having crap handwriting in cursive ) . 
   i hope she gets fired . 
  by the murdock press ? 
  more likely that she 'll get a promotion . 
  as far as flag creation stories go , it 's probably the most awesome i 've read . 
  how are these megathreads still a thing ? 
  atheists ? 
   ... a legend refers to a mortally wounded chief of a latvian tribe who was wrapped in a white sheet . 
  the part of the sheet on which he was lying remained white , but the two edges were stained in his blood . 
  during the next battle the bloodstained sheet was used as a flag . 
  according to the legend this time the latvian warriors were successful and drove the enemy away . 
  ever since then latvian tribes have used these colours ... 
  how big is the usa 's militaries advertising budget ? 
  every local church in every european village/town/city . 
   imagine going to the louvre and be able to say , all these are ours , not theirs . 
  one of my most that really threw me in europe was when i was talking to a dane about football , and he refereed to it as a game invented by ` us ' . 
  i quizzed him on it , and he meant ` us ' as in european as it was invented in the uk . 
  it threw me that a european would think of the british as more ` us ' than anyone from the commonwealth .

  [ native australians never forget ... and never forgive ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emu_war ), 
  well technically they are n't illegal immigrants , they never arrived in australia and would have been put in an off-shore detention centre under our previous polices ( now we just turn them back without processing them at all , which i disagree with , australia has a long history of successfully integrating refugees from terrible backgrounds without any major problems , but many benefits ) . 
  these people have never been in australia , probably are n't refugees and hence would never have had the chance to live in australia . 
  also , wow , such terrified ( / s ) , some idiots thought they could just get on a boat and land in australia , failed and then blamed the country that turned them back . 
  i 'm not shocked or surprised by that , i can relate to their anger and frustration , but i think they are just a bunch of irrelevant idiots . 
   in australia there was a footage of illegal immigrants saying `` fuck australia '' when was this ? 
  i think the scale and type of investment is relevant to consider in this issue . 
  from the linked article :  the only catch is that the a$ 5 million must be invested in state and territory australian government debt , privately-owned australian companies and managed funds that invest in australian assets regulated by the australian securities & investment commission for four years . 
  [ here is the link to the actual visa , and it can be seen that it 's a bit more flexible than the article indicates ] ( http://www.border.gov.au/trav/visa-1/188 - ) . 
  these visa 's are essentially about providing a stream for foreign direct investment into australia , the issue with these visas is that they yes they provide a stream for investment into those countries , i would guess that they are advertised as a way to get eu citizenship for a price . 
  selling citizenship , and not about promoting investment . 
  and in true british fashion , we all expect you to find a way to complain about it . 
  no one caught russia fabricating a claim . 
  i think he 's referring to the graphic that this whole thread is about , not to the link in the comment by rsqfree, 
   we all simply revolve around the us nowadays yep , there is n't even much of an economic relationship anymore aswell , imports form the uk the australia were just [ aud$ 12.5 billion , and exports were aud$ 7.8 billion ] ( http://www.austrade.gov.au/export/export-markets/countries/united-kingdom/market-profile ) , [ or in a more helpful context 3.1 % of our trade ] ( http://dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-at-a-glance/pages/default.aspx ) . 
  there just is n't anything there to build on to replace the relationship the uk has with the eu . 
  the empire/commonwealth is n't going to have a resurgence anytime soon , but for some reason british people seem to think that they can leave the eu and set up a similar union with the anglosphere . 
  the empire died in ww2 and it is n't coming back . 
  the uk is in a terrible financial position relative the the other prospective members : any union of the aus/uk/nz / canada ( and maybe the us ) .

  i was under the impression that greek defence spending is so high because of a fear of turkey , greek and turks relations have always been very complicated . 
  because the euro was kept ridiculously low because of the southern euro countries , germans instinctively love their pollies . 
  dat ass, 
  people who work on ships do n't generally pay income tax in any country , i know from expirience that they do n't in australia , the uk , finland , denmark ... 
  sorry , i should clarify that i meant decriminalisation of homosexuality , not equal rights . 
  it really is the same , interesting , we do n't have a multi party system but the majority of coalition/lnp voters approve of marriage equality , it 's the politicians that are the problem . 
  we do n't have civil unions in australia though , but our system deems de-facto relationships as equal in most ways to marriage . 
  it shows the the european union does n't do transfer payments , unlike the american , canadian and australian federations . 
  quite disappointing really .
