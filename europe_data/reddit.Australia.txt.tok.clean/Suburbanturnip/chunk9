  i honestly ca n't see anything on the 457 visa page about a minimum income requirement ? 
   australia also uses this type of criteria with roughly the same amount ( just around $ 80k ) . 
  sorry , which visa is this one ? 
  as far as i 'm aware none of our skilled visa are restricted by income but by profession . 
  as far as i know it just makes it easier to prove english fluency , we get not special commonwealth visas or anything along those lines being aussies . 
  we have plastic notes in australia , and the temperatures you 're talking are more along the lines of if you put them in a drier or under an iron , not from a hot car . 
  after the body shrinks down to a normal weight and shape post pregnancy the scar is actually quite small . 
  actually the average australian wage is a bit north of $ 4000 per month . 
  in western australia it 's closer to $ 7000 per month ( well it was before the mining boom got replaced with a redundancy boom ) . 
  young constitution ? 
  it 's older that most eu countries constitutions . 
  if you google the article name , and access the article from a google search result it takes you around the paywall . 
  but estonia is nordic to us aussies . 
  it 's an ongoing investigation , details should n't really be published just yet . 
  it 's pretty common to have work restrictions on student visas , otherwise you get people signing up for fake/dodgy schools and just coming in as a worker . 
  they are here to study , not work . 
  it 's below the average full time salary in australia ( by # 1500 ) , yay !, 
  yes it really would make the whole commonwealth alot easier to manage . 
  actually no , in the usas system , they have both state and federal citizenship . 
   he 's foulmouthed i ca n't speak for europeans , but that 's half the reason we love eastern europeans in australia , they blend in well . 
  ( let 's not be awkward about it , they did try ), 
  this ` refuge ' crisis is seeming like more of a joke every day to the rest of the world , every single day . 
  that 's rachael . 
  alien policy is a correct translation , it 's a catch call term for people that are foreign citizens . 
  where refugees and immigrants tend to be subsets of this . 
  australia and canada ( preciously to this refugee crisis ) had the highest per capita immigration in the world , in australia this amounts to a net migration of about 220,000 last year ( 5 % of these were refugees ) . 
  if we were taking in a per capita level of refugees equivalent with sweden , this would be about 450,000 refugees . 
  how on earth does sweden think it can double the immigration rate of the two biggest immigrant countries with unskilled and uneducated labour effectively . 
  it 's utter lunacy . 
  europe : where left and right are n't determined by economic policies . 
  fn is extremely left wing in everything but immigration . 
  technically christmas island is australia , we usually send them back to indonesia . 
  no , we either process them for years in the country of naru , or we push them back into indonesian waters . 
  well the russians were never known for their good economic management . 
  it 's not really fair to compare canada 's ( and by extensions australia 's ) humanitarian and refugee intake , for pretty much both countries all our humanitarian intake comes from genuine refugees in refugee camps , they are processed in the camps to determine their refugee status , and the integration progress starts in the camps with classes on australia/canada , our customs and way of life , language courses , and expectations of the refugees . 
  it 's an extremely different scenario to what europe is doing right now . 
  also , in both countries cases , humanitarians intake is about only 5 % -8 % of immigration . 
  well we already know they will get to stay regardless of the asylum application outcome , the only relevant result to them is if they can get a work permit ... 
  but considering their level of skills , most of them wo n't speak a european language fluently and wo n't have a recognised higher education , so the most they can hope for is cash in hand jobs , so a work permit is irrelevant . 
  to be fair ` turkey has spent years allowing jihadist groups to flourish ' could be used to describe most european countries . 
  is this a french thing to have so much info over an ongoing investigation ? 
  if this was australia they would be saying ` we can neither deny or conform the existence of a city called paris ' . 
  unless the russians retaliate ... 
  but it does explain why more and more voters find their stance appealing . 
  australia says : no thanks , freedom of movement with the u.k is n't popular with australians . 
  numbers are racist in sweden . 
  you have my axe !, 
  factoring in an assumed tax rate of 30 % , wow , that comes out as barely above the minimum weekly australian wage ( $ aud656 .90 / week ) , i now understand their frustration . 
  for reference , the average copper salary in australia is 35k sek/month . 
  `` sweden is what tumblr would look like if it was a country '', 
  and to be fair , it just pushes the problem further into the future , even with the highest levels of per capita immigration in the world ( before the refugee crisis ) in australia and canada and near replacement birth rate the aging population is still a major issue for us . 
  the 2007-2008 crisis was more of a european and american thing than anywhere else tbh , the chinese economy kept going strong which is what kept the region growing . 
  it is n't covered well in the article , but it 's due to the genders being different for the same root words in both languages , so the fusion resulted in no genders . 
  haha , woops , it was 4 am in australia when i posted that and i guess i was a little sleepy still . 
  fixed .

  well there is a global war for skilled migrants going in , is it our fault if most of the eu does n't want to compete ? 
  looking at our recent history you can expect the president to change every 6 months aswell, 
  i just ca n't understand how sweden can ship refugees and migrants to another country , how is that not considered a major diplomatic crisis ? 
  the important thing is that we both beat the uk again . 
  imo due to the diaspora of native english speakers , and the wide variety of fluently english speakers with different accents , vowels in english tend to vary quite a lot , but the sounds of the consonants tends to remain fairly similar but not the vowel sounds , you just ca n't have that many vowel sounds in a row and have the pronunciation remain vaguely consistent . 
  that , and i 'm pretty sure ` litauen ' would become `` litau ` n '' within a week in australia , and then the next week it would be `` li'au ` n '', 
  i would vote for ` litauen ' being a bit to open to interpretation for it 's pronunciation with three vowels in a row . 
  relevant username, 
  gdp = !, 
  government budget unless it 's a 100 % communist state ... 
  well he also failed to pass two budgets and was the shortest ever serving aussie pm ( after harold hold who was lost at sea while surfing ) , so it 's probably good to listen to polls . 
  this is why the eu should replace the uk with the aus and nz , if anything well do it just to spite the uk while technically keeping lizzy in the eu . 
  to be fair , the british suck at the west minster system and really should learn from us colonials . 
  the unhcr actually has a resettlement process for refugees in refugee camps - it 's how australia gets all our refugees . 
   norway , denmark , sweden , uk , france , germany , poland , lithuania , ukraine , luxembourg , spain , latvia , portugal , hungary , and a few more . 
  oi mate , do n't forget the coalition of the willing that started it all with you : australia , canada and the uk . 
  i like most australians did n't think we should have gone at the time , but the anglosphere stands together above all else . 
   save rozhen observatory , bulgaria that campaign does n't seem to have been well planned to take advantage of donations from europeans outside of bulgaria - no offence , but bulgarians do n't have that much disposable income for europeans . 
  it 's obviously not going to reach it 's goal at this point , but after it fails ( we learn best from our failures ! ), 
  and they go back to the drawing board , you should get in contact with them to organise a better campaign . 
  currently the perks are a tatto festival ticket , and a free tour - not very attractive perks to people that do n't live in the area . 
  ideas : send people a post-card photo of the observatory for a $ 5 donation ( there are apps out there e.g. 
  touchnote that make this easy , combine with importing contact details from an excel sheet , and you get people to input their details using a form to populate said excel spreadsheet ) , that 's just one idea .
