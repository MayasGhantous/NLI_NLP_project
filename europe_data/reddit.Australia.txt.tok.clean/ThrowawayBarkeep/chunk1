all the beverages i used are in the background plus simple syrup which is home made . 
  [ i made 3 ] ( http://cardiffconfidential.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/2012-05-08-20-59-00.jpg ) ^ ^ you ^ ^ have ^ ^ to ^ ^ take ^ ^ acid ^ ^ to ^ ^ see ^ ^ it ^ ^ properly . 
  romania has tasted the best , second is ukraine , germany tasted like jager and estonia did n't taste very good at all . 
  it was designed for drunks , i assumed they have fallen over already . 
  i 'll be doing sweden and uk tomorrow . 
  i 'll be doing sweden and uk tomorrow , i 'll do lithuania the next day . 
  i 'll be doing some flags with white in them mid - late next week . 
  bulgaria 's got a good chance of being in there . 
  i 'm not sure , / r/europe seems to really like the shots so i might post it hear with some eu countries . 
  i 'll probably post it to / r/southafrica and / r/africa as well . 
  it 's not like i 've been looking at property or anything ... that would be crazy . 
  and i totally have n't been looking at immigration and citizenship laws either . 
  why does no one believe me ? 
  i have no clue what i 'm looking at , should i submit the swedish shot there when i make it ? 
  i will , and i have an idea to make it pretty cool . 
  gin for the jack , but i 'll probably use ouzo for iceland . 
  i love you . 
  it 'll be less than $ 35 . 
  i could do a jello shot maybe ... or do the cross on the outside with simple syrup and casting sugar . 
  lets make a deal ... 
  i love dragon fruit . 
  holy shit . 
  i need snake wine . 
  chances are it 'll just be a strip of red to represent the dragon . 
  maybe i should buy a bottle of [ royal dragon imperial vodka ] ( http://www.despensavaldes.com/webroot/store/shops/despensavaldes/5269/0724/0989/4642/cf88/55ee/0960/0f50/vodka_dragon_royal.jpg ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ ^ tell ^ ^ ^ people ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ jesus . 
  what did i do to you ? 
  i want to get some spirytus rektyfikowany . 
  i ca n't get everclear in australia , i 'm looking at getting some polish vodka at 95 % but it 's $ 75 for 500ml . 
  i could use ouzo so it 's white instead of clear . 
  grenadine on it 's own would be very dark red , probably use vodka , simple syrup ( to make it heavier ) and a couple of drops of grenadine . 
  the icelandic flag is going to be very similar to the union jack ( blue , gin , red , gin , and blue ) . 
  maybe i could use white ( ouzo ) instead of gin . 
  do you have any other ideas ? 
  i could do blue , clear , red at the moment or use white next week . 
  it 's pretty simple to do , you just need to understand the density of the liquid and how to manipulate it ( increase alcohol % to make it lighter , decrease alcohol % to make it heavier ) . 
  after that it 's just making sure you pour lighter liquids on top of heavier ones . 
   do n't answer any of those questions do n't tell me what to do . 
  no i 'm not a bartender but i 'm looking at becoming one . 
  i have n't used any dye and i do n't think it will be necessary to use any . 
  i 've got 34 bottles of alcohol on my shelf at the moment plus mixes and non-alcoholic stuff ( grenadine , simple syrup and sweet and sour mix ) . 
  i might do sweden and uk tomorrow . 
  maybe blue , gin , red , gin , and blue . 
  it 's be hard to layer 5 different colours , but i might try . 
  i messed up the romanian flag a few times so i 've already drank a few shots tonight , maybe tomorrow . 
  ( warning i 'll be using shitty gin , i do n't like gin ), 
  i 've done blue and yellow for ukraine , maybe blue , yellow and then blue again for the swedish flag , what do you think ? 
  i 'll be getting some white liquor mid next week , i 'll work something out around then . 
  the problem is , if i just use the union jacks colours it 's red , white and blue . 
  i 'd like to use some liquor from the uk to set it apart from us or aus but nothing comes to mind . 
  i really want to do the [ south african ] ( http://futuristex.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/photo-3.jpg ) flag , it might be a bit hard . 
  [ how to do a shot russian style ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvzjlacvqzo ), 
  it 's no longer available from dan murphy 's , trust me i 've rang all the shops even remotely close to me . 
  but thanks for the link . 
  what are my other options besides drinking them ? 
  throwing them out ? 
  that 's not going to happen . 
  i 've drank all three that i 've submitted , along with 2 that i messed up the layering on . 
  none of them have had a strong alcohol burn . 
  we apparently have some decent australian vodkas , i 'll have a look for one . 
  edit : [ 666 pure tasmanian vodka ] ( http://www.danmurphys.com.au/product/dm_760560/666-pure-tasmanian-vodka-700ml ), 
  i 've got a couple in mind that i can send you , are you a beer , rum or wine guy ? 
  cheers for the video . 
  here 's a bit of australian history for you , [ bob hawke ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bob_hawke ) , who is our third longest serving prime minister , set a new world speed record for beer drinking ; he downed 2\u00a01\u20442 imperial pints ( 1.4 l ) - equivalent to a yard of ale - from a sconce pot in 11 seconds as part of a college penalty . 
  i check a site that will ship to me , i 'd pay $ 75 for a 500ml bottle . 
  if you could look into it that 'd be awesome . 
  i 'm not looking to drink it strait , more for lighting the tops of drinks on fire ( currently use 151 rum ) or the lighten drinks while layering . 
  that better be 95 % . 
  be honest , did you drink it ? 
  and how much for you to ship me some ? 
  here 's a secret , it tastes like ass . 
  it 's a great vodka , blows anything else out of the water and is way cheaper than anything close to it . 
  done , [ kwa\u015bniewski 's eastern partnership ] ( http://imgur.com/44evzyc ) and here 's [ one for the lives lost ] ( http://imgur.com/jd2gv8d ) . 
  and a big reason i want to go to estonia is my dollar goes a lot further . 
  nope , no connection . 
  i plan to move to estonia after uni , but that 's no time soon . 
  i have n't been exposed to any of the marketing , i just got it on a whim and liked it . 
  a lot of my friends who do n't like the burn of alcohol like it too because it has no burn . 
  i ended up trading my 1/4 full bottle for a 3/4 full bottle of old drambuie to my english tutors husband , he loved the stuff as well . 
  i 'll check out k\u00e4nnu kukk , but i 'll have to pass on p\u00f5ltsamaa t\u00f5mmu as i 'm not a wine guy at all . 
  they 'd both be pretty easy to make . 
  ` protasiewicz ' it is . 
  but it 's a polish last name , why are we naming something polish after ger ... ^ ^ is ^ ^ this ^ ^ a ^ ^ wwii ^ ^ thing ? 
  i 'm very ok with that . 
  you 're going to have to give me a translation . 
  my german extends to a greeting and calling them a dick head . 
  i could have used the espresso or a dark rum , a black absinth would work great if i had one , but when i saw the j\u00e4ger i had to use it . 
  it tastes like j\u00e4ger , i 'll let you decide if it 's good or bad . 
  [ done ] ( http://imgur.com/56zhqup ) the drink is now called the [ ` protasiewicz ' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1z2wvy/still_bored_heres_the_german_flag_as_a_shot_as/cfq07l5 ), 
  most australians do n't know estonia exists . 
  edit : although when i 've told any of my friends about estonia , they seemed to like it . 
  some of them did n't like the cold though , we often go over 40c in summer and rarely below 0 . 
  ( i might be presenting a biased image to them , i plan on moving to estonia ), 
  do n't tell me what to do . 
  i 'm going to make a german one now . 
  yes it 's a coffee liquor , similar to kahlua . 
  no , it 's more a sweet taste . 
  i think we could be friends . 
  i like estonia ( * may be obvious * ) so i looked online to see if there were any drinks that were popular in estonia that i had n't tried . 
  some shipping fees latter , i had a bottle of each .
