  one is irreplaceable . 
  people can move to a new village , we ca n't relocate the reef . 
  sounds like australia . 
  actually i 'm sure we 're worse . 
  edit : [ article on new adani coal mine near reef ] ( https://www.getup.org.au/campaigns/great-barrier-reef--3/adani-video-report/help-stop-adani-from-destroying-the-great-barrier-reef ), 
  it 's actually reddiquette ( linked in the panel on the right ) that says the downvote button is n't a dislike button . 
  no , carl555 did n't say anything about the topic . 
  they are disagreeing with the excessive use of downvote as a disagree button . 
  our immigration rate is almost double uk 's . 
  only european countries with higher rates are luxembourg , norway and spain . 
  hard to tell if you 're a hypocrite or not without a flare . 
  it 's really not as simple as applying for citizenship and hey presto . 
  [ israel almost entirely halts citizenship approvals for east jerusalemites ] ( http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-almost-entirely-halts-citizenship-approvals-for-east-jerusalemites/ ), 
  he ca n't singlehandedly cancel the deal . 
  the deal is n't just between the us and iran . 
  this was my first thoughts and i was surprised it took so long for it to even be mentioned in the comments . 
  and still calls herself a girl . 
  the boys names seem very anglicized is all . 
  not looking very swedish . 
  rank | boys | girls --------- | ---------- | ---------- 1 | oliver | charlotte 2 | william | olivia 3 | jack | amelia 4 | noah | ava 5 | thomas | mia 6 | james | sophia 7 | jackson/jaxon | chloe 8 | ethan | emily 9 | lucas | sophie 10 | lachlan | grace, 
  why the surprise ? 
  do n't most countries with modern police and military forces ? 
  are people generally more proficient in swedish or english ? 
  this smells horribly like trickle down economics . 
  is there even a pic of the guy to see if he 's worth watching ? 
  australia racing to the bottom :-\\, 
  the base ( s ) they have in australia to facilitate drone strikes in the middle east . 
  red hair is also found amongst the ashkenazi jewish populations . 
  [ 24 ] in 1903 , 5.6 % of polish jews had red hair . 
  [ 25 ] other studies have found that 3.69 % of jewish women overall were found to have red hair , but around 10.9 % of all jewish men have red beards . 
  [ 26 ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_hair, 
  i think sometimes flag carrier is just a historical designation . 
  i do n't think you can blame the french exclusively for that . 
  a large portion of african christians are non-catholic and many of these denominations as they are practiced in africa are also anti-contraception . 
  also most of the cultures in africa seem to be anti-contraceptive regardless of religion . 
  i think you might underestimate the lengths that israel went to in suppressing use of yiddish in order to allow hebrew to succeed . 
  people were also forced to hebraize their names against their will when immigrating . 
  they did their best to kill yiddish rather than allow it to coexist , although it still continued to survive in pockets . 
  still happening although they 've been overtaken by asian countries in recent decades . 
  i can see why the 2.5 % would be a problem . 
  has there been a study on how often inflation and average earnings growth matches or exceeds 2.5 % ? 
  why do n't you like triple lock ? 
  ireland has irish as official language in eu , malta has maltese . 
  that strange moment when the most spoken language in the eu ( even after uk leaves ) is no longer an official eu language . 
  have they transformed fn or is it the voters that have transformed ? 
  fillon won in lebanon too 60.97 %, 
  high scores for fillon in lebanon and israel too . 
  ca n't the eu just terminate the ascension once and for all ? 
  what 's preventing them ? 
  a further deterioration in relations ? 
  how does monaco manage to protected 53.4 % of its territory ? 
  nice one . 
  thanks !, 
  there is a likelihood of just as many other voters in these countries as well . 
  none of them having been polled . 
  maybe means economic liberal ? 
  ie neoliberalism and freemarkets ? 
  otherwise i dunno . 
  would would supporters of le pen be any more likely to be in us/uk than other candidates ? 
  this thread really should have been set to sort by new by default . 
  it means / u/unitpoland needs to provide a link for the info or it 's bullshit . 
  where does it say that ? 
  they 're both promising to hold a referendum on eu membership , so yes . 
  i read the whole thing . 
  australians can into europe it seems . 
  the us is n't exactly breezing through wars on its own either and it 's considered a superpower . 
  so not many people live in houses ? 
  the german `` r '' is even softer than the french . 
  german is really not harsh at all . 
  the same can be said for bogans in australia . 
  there are plenty of bogans with $ $ $ these days and plenty of working-class that do n't act like them . 
  his accent or lack thereof is really impressive . 
  these are hilarious but i can hardly talk when my attempts at another language are worse . 
   opponents have seen the pipeline as a move by russia to bypass traditional transit countries ( currently ukraine , slovakia , czech republic , belarus and poland ) . 
  [ 83 ] some transit countries are concerned that a long-term plan of the kremlin is to attempt to exert political influence on them by threatening their gas supply without affecting supplies to western europe . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord_stream#political_aspects there 's more at the link . 
  the no longer with us steve irwin . 
  there are 1047 ( 0.0043 % of population ) with my surname and 4703 ( 0.019 % of population ) with my mother 's maiden name . 
   most european countries have a social security system where you have to pay into the system for a while before you can access benefits . 
  what happens with youth unemployment where someone has had little opportunity yet to pay into the system ? 
  i did n't even know the origin of black friday . 
  til . 
  here , anywhere that serves alcohol must provide free tap water , but otherwise it 's at their discretion . 
  not very good vampires were they . 
  do these kinds of tourist come from any country in particular ? 
  it 's always said flippantly , never a true apology ( in english at least ) . 
  well done !, 
  your score : 98 % 3:02 mixed up bosnia and herzegovina with macedonia . 
  i really should have known macedonia would be right next to greece . 
  did the palatalisation develop in estonian because of contact with russian ? 
  it 's soccer in australia , new zealand and south africa too . 
  how common is it in czechia ? 
  i got nz and south african over australia ( mine ) . 
  i got romanian too . 
  wonder where we tripped up for it to think that ? 
  well it depends on the native speaker . 
  most native speakers are aware of when they 're using `` incorrect '' colloquialisms like that . 
  i did n't select anything non-grammatical when i did the quiz and i even ignored some idioms that i know are used in other english dialects . 
  did it again and i 'm still a kiwi .
