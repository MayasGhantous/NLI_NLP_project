well cnn was reporting that even the [ orbital sciences launch failure was a nasa rocket . 
  ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/za0lbrrxgmw/0.jpg ) they 'll be guaranteed to claim rosetta/philae . 
  munich was voted out of the 2018 bidding , they did n't have an official 2022 bid . 
  ~ ~ we had a referendum to withdraw our bid , but i think the ioc vote still had munich in the running ( ca n't remember what the result of the referendum was tbh ) . ~ ~ the cities that pulled out of 2022 bidding were krakow , lviv , oslo and stockholm . 
  edit - disregard that . 
  i 'm all mixed up ... munich had a bid for 2018 but failed , with the ioc voting for pyeongchang . 
  the 2022 bid was proposed by the german olympic committee , and a referendum was held in november last year with the citizens voting against it . 
  the bid was never officially lodged . 
  let 's face it - the countries/cities that are interested in hosting the olympics are interested because they have insufficient modern infrastructure in the first place . 
  it 's the perfect excuse to spend government money on new stadia , transportation and facilities . 
   i wish the metrification would stop . 
  it would have stopped decades ago if you guys did n't half-arse it . 
  since moving to munich nearly 6 years ago , visualising [ one litre ] ( http://www.asklubo.com/uploads/attachments/published/12/11696/de/mas-bier-die-einheit-der-menge.jpg ) has become much more intuitive . 
  somehow it keeps getting bigger ... up to 75000 capacity for bundesliga matches nowadays . 
  i know tons of germans called ben . 
  they 're all called benedikt though , no benjamins ( once you hear the typical german attempt to say `` benchamin '' , you 'll know why ) . 
  it 's been 15 years since australia 's referendum and there has n't been a squeak since . 
  tony abbott is a monarchist too so there wo n't be much going on for a few years yet . 
  they need to get some workers to mend that huge crack on the footpath . 
  the br\u00e4ustubn is great . 
  service is a bit shit , but they make up for it with hearty food and cheap prices . 
  for example : dachauer volksfest . 
  much smaller than oktoberfest , but the beer is tons cheaper and imo the atmosphere more genuine . 
  i love starkbierfest at nockherberg too , mainly because of the beer . 
  even the fr\u00fchlingsfest and g\u00e4ubodenvolksfest are getting touristy these days . 
  there 's tons of locals that still go . 
  some of the tents are full of tourists ( i.e. 
  hofbr\u00e4uzelt is an aussie/kiwi shitfest ) , but others are still attended by many locals . 
  a large proportion of local businesses have work outings there , for example . 
  it could be because i 'm an aussie myself , but most of the english-speaking tourists i meet at the fest are either kiwis or aussies . 
  quite a few danish people over the years too . 
   it 's also generally hilariously america-centric ( not a slight on the yanks as a whole but it 's just because it mostly seems to be yanks using the term against other yanks and then applying the specific american context to the whole wide world ) . 
  that explains why i immediately think the poster is a yank , every single time . 
  i 've been seeing this phrase on reddit ( and only on reddit ) for about a year now , and i still do n't know what the fuck it 's supposed to mean . 
  `` x dish that 's only eaten in bumfuck countryside is way better than y national dish '' . 
  i was also ultra disappointed to see the lowly currywurst there too . 
  if you have the option for trams , night trams are great . 
  they run all through the night at 20 minute intervals . 
  but yes , the scarcity of u-bahn and s-bahn options in the early hours is kinda disappointing . 
  i live in the 2nd ring and work on sonnenstra\u00dfe - for me , it 's just $ 42 a month on my current abo . 
  i just use streifenkarten if i ever travel further . 
  we also live on the 16/17 tram line , so night connections are great for us . 
  would n't surprise me . 
  gema can go and get fucked ( even if they are n't involved ... 
  i just feel the need to say that at every opportunity ) . 
  we only get charged $ 5 a month for membership . 
  current rates are 24c/km , and $ 2 an hour , but i think the kilometre price is going up to 29c for piecemeal kilometres in september when they 're introducing prepaid kilometre packs for 22c/km . 
  for the amount we use it , it 's great value . 
  and the cars are decent too !, 
  not quite as good as the first one we were in ( they had audi a1s and a3s with s-packages and stuff ) , but the kias with citeecar are still great cars . 
  we 're with a company called citeecar . 
  their business model involves `` zones '' where a certain number of share cars live - you can book them online , or grab them without a booking if they 're free . 
  you pay by the hour and for the number of kilometres you travel , and you need to return the car to the zone it belongs in - citeecar covers our insurance and fuel costs . 
  this has the big advantage that there 's always a good chance of a car being close to you if you live in a zone , but the disadvantage that you ca n't do one-way trips across town . 
  there 's other schemes out there like bmw 's drivenow , which has a distribution of cars that are just spread around the city - all you have to do is park them ( legally ) inside the huge single zone . 
  they are probably a touch more convenient , but there 's zero guarantee of a car being parked near your house . 
  it 's so effective here in munich that we ultimately used our car so little that it 's battery went flat through inactivity . 
  we sold it soon after that , and now use a combination of share cars and public transport . 
  we still only use the share cars once every couple of months . 
  we also have two kids , and have rarely needed a car . 
  that said , we might consider it when they get a bit older and start playing sport or something ... but we 'll see . 
  in short - it 's fucking amazing . 
  moving from adelaide where public transport is a fucking disgrace is such a stark difference . 
  i thought adelaide 's britannia roundabout was bad . 
  i have the sudden urge to play civ 5 . 
  looks like they chopped the front off , tilted it backwards 15 degrees , and welded it back on . 
  those look horrible for pedestrian safety . 
  also , crashing into a car with a low nose could easily derail this tram . 
  in munich , they still occasionally use the [ baureihe p ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nvocry7x8i0/uy6lzdkwfli/aaaaaaaacxk/qqx_abup048/s1600/muenchen_09.jpg ) on normal routes . 
  they also use the p for the party tram !, 
  i actually really like riding the old trams , but they 're terrible for wheelchair/pram access . 
  they also use the even older [ baureihe m ] ( https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8492/8290673449_35587586a1.jpg ) during christmas as the christkindltram . 
  munich has just ordered new so-called `` c2 '' trains for the u-bahn system . 
  [ they look pretty sweet , ] ( http://www.tz.de/bilder/2014/02/21/3378305/161617350-u-bahn-xa5vcmef.jpg ) but i think they 're just a derivative of the current c-class trains already in service . 
  another thing to note is that the [ a-class and b-class trains ] ( http://www.michaeltaylor.ca/trams/germany/6229-mun-mt.jpg ) , which look very similar ( that 's an a-class shown in the picture ) , are more common than the c-class . 
  they can also run on higher graded tracks . 
  `` rubbish bins of europe '', 
  next we need `` rubbish bins of europe '' . 
  they only get 60 % uptime . 
  maybe if your destination was fiji . 
  getting to places like japan and korea ( as shown by your map ) will be problematic though . 
  munich has some [ cool new buses with hybrid powertrains . 
  ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/68066857.jpg ) these [ man bendy buses ] ( http://www.bus-bild.de/1024/man-bus-der2-generation-am-76954.jpg ) are what you normally get though ( at least on lines i ride most often ) . 
  [ we have those in munich too . 
  ] ( http://cdn2.getyourguide.com/img/tour_img-166461-48.jpg ), 
  [ australia 's pride and joy . 
  well , except the salt . 
  i suppose because it 's not a warzone , rather a `` crisis zone '' . 
  virtually all airlines that run those routes still fly over ukraine . 
  lufthansa and air berlin have already announced they are no longer using ukrainian airspace . 
  nothin at all !, 
  oh that 's right , i totally forgot . 
  thanks for celebrating the queen 's birthday and australia day , comrades !, 
  plenty of political apathy though , that 's for sure !, 
  i think a lot of europeans would probably reject the name arse , too . 
  not many monarchists in aus mate . 
  the influence of the royal family here is very low . 
  countries united in neverending togetherness, 
  allied republic states of europe , or arse for short . 
  this is how it works in australia too .
