  true , can never know . 
  i lived in germany for a year and had them correct my english a few times thinking they 'd outsmarted me . 
  there 's just certain nuances in a language that can be so hard to learn if you do n't grow up with them : /, 
  nah , we 're in eurovision , that 's why . 
  wait , are you starting an english-off with a native speaker ? 
  hold on , let me just get some popcorn . 
  it 's ok , they ca n't hear us in this sub . 
  ah yeah fair enough . 
  our governor-general ( like a president ) here in australia did that once and it caused a shitstorm . 
  can the president dismiss parliament there ? 
  ca n't find his list of powers on wikipedia . 
  so different !, 
  my first visit to poland . 
  we arrived in krak\u00f3w by train . 
  the station was awful , looked really run down like everything was falling apart . 
  i was thinking `` what have i got myself into '' and then we walked through the walkway where it was just as bad then found the door out and bam brand new 21st century shopping centre everything beautiful and clean and new . 
  someone commented later that this was the difference between the public and private sectors at the time . 
  ( this was 2010 ), 
   sex ambulance that 's what he said . 
  the fucking ambulance .

  * ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ so ^ ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ google ^ ^ ^ translate, 
  or maybe the * romansh * part . 
  yeah , i remember this from aoe 2 as well . 
  and the have an independence streak . 
  it 's so cute !, 
  i swear i saw it on / r/awww the other day, 
  might be because they 're not building a new cathedral for him . 
  it would be the neu . 
  new european union and the german speakers get an appropriate abbreviation out of it . 
  so the union of monaco and netherlands ? 
  i wo n't ever forget my trip to krakow in 2010 . 
  first time in eastern europe that year and pulled into the station . 
  when we got out of the train the sign for the station was lopsided and the whole place looked like it was falling apart . 
  the ground was uneven and everything looked in maintained or abandoned . 
  i was wondering what if gotten myself into . 
  so we went down under to get out of the station and it 's the same run down look in there and we go through the exit doors ... into a beautiful new clean shopping mall like i was back in the west . 
  it blew my mind how the two were right side by side . 
  was have you gesaid ? 
  original says `` take '' . 
  he used `` make '' instead ( which is english equivalent of the german word `` machen '' ), 
  * and created then disowned by the british, 
   make even if you did n't have your flag i coulda guessed you were german . 
  you replace every verb with machen . 
  if shit is in a state of mild chaos anyway because of the eu leaving then those factors wo n't be as important . 
  australia is . 
  can we join the eu now ? 
  we 're their only friends now . 
   time for better visas !, 
  good point . 
  i see what you mean . 
  but there 's a huge emotional and `` patriotic '' argument here . 
  the sooner the new referendum the more likely it 'll be a ` yes ' . 
  if they say it 'll be in like 2 years , it 'll be another ` no ' . 
  question : will english be dropped as a working language in the eu ? 
  there is a very real possibility that there 'll be a new scottish independence referendum soon , and then a strong chance they 'll vote ` yes ' . 
  go back a few years before the last referendum . 
  imagine if someone told you `` yes scotland will be independent soon , but they 'll be in the eu while the rest of the uk wo n't be . '', 
  get ready to lose scotland now too . 
  a big part of the `` stay '' vote in the independence referendum was they 'd be staying in the eu . 
  looking at the results today , where pretty much all of scotland voted to stay , you will see the snp call for a new referendum to leave the uk so they can stay in the eu very soon . 
  and the sooner they do it , the sooner they 'll vote yes to independence . 
  prob london . 
  half the population is aussie already . 
  but what about your russian minority ? 
  will someone not help them ? 
  do n't suggest that . 
  they have guns remember . 
  seriously . 
  english speaker here . 
  when i went to denmark i had the weirdest feeling that everyone was actually speaking english but we 're just mumbling it so bad i could n't understand it . 
  australia has had a fetish for eurovision since abba . 
  it 's was like our national dream come true to be apart of last year and again this year . 
  how can england sustain it then ? 
  the area is n't much different . 
  bit of hyperbole , they 're using google analytics and facebook too , so you 're on american nsa databases as much as you are russian ones . 
  very trivial . 
  english + german = dutch , really, 
  why is sweden removed not norway ? 
  there 's an electoral district in melbourne , australia called batman ( after a guy called john batman i think ) . 
  so there 's a member of parliament for batman . 
  `` how fitting '' i think is more appropriate . 
  irony would be the opposite . 
  ca n't remember but knowing him it was probably some sort of late night broadcast of an overseas sports game . 
  well , in australia , by the time we woke up it was `` over '' . 
  i do remember it though , my brother running into my room waking me up . 
  and just being transfixed by it all day . 
  heading to library at school to check the internet for more news . 
  i realised later that i had actually taped it unfolding on channel 10 . 
  i had set the tape to record a show i wanted , but being tapes you either have to press stop or let it record till the end of the tape . 
  well it all started unfolding while the late night news was on ( i even remember it was sandra sully hosting it ) which was straight after my show and i got it . 
  sadly my brother taped over it a few weeks later . 
  i was so pissed at him , i felt like it was really significant piece of history . 
  edit : just realized we live in an age where i could probably find it . 
  could n't find the whole thing , but found [ this piece from the 10th anniversary that talks about it and slices clips with an interview ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elsewogfbkm ) edit : [ found one that has it uncut ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a572ra90ht4 ) , does n't have it all , it cuts to another channel in part 2 . 
  and channel 10 defers to cnn for most of it , but you can see in the parts where she speaks sandra is trying hard to keep it together . 
  well aware . 
  but not sure my graphics application can do an image hundreds of thousands of pixels wide . 
  i took part in the anti-war march in sydney in 2003 .
