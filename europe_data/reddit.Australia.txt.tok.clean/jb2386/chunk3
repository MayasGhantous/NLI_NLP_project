  and was coincidentally on a school excursion to the city the day [ this was painted on the opera house ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wmcberh.jpg ) . 
  still a lot of needless death :( our prime minister was in dc at the time , too . 
  not trying to take away from how horrific all this is , but i was just curious how 9/11 in the usa fit into this , so i put it on : http://i.imgur.com/vpxxx0a.jpg, 
  [ spain is eta .

  it 's gross . 
  summer is just the worst :(, 
  oh i 'd love to move there . 
  but then i hear about how terrible the fruit is there :( i guess i 'm lucky here in australia . 
  i just really really really hate summer/hot weather . 
  was this romania 's way of opposing communism ? 
  yes i do believe it 's a requirement for joining the eu . 
  can australia take your place ? 
  even hungary too . 
  what the hell . 
  are you also squatting ? 
  you sound american . 
  and with more people . 
  they 'd be the most populous nation in the eu . 
  imagine that . 
  queen liz interjects , ensures brexit ca n't go ahead and then abstains . 
  that 's how 2017 can trump 2016 . 
   who bothered to vote yes , but that means everyone else essentially voted ` abstain ' . 
  either go with compulsory voting or respect people 's right not to vote . 
  yeah , nice . 
  not sure what my sector is like in hungary , but it 's high paying in australia . 
  my ancestry is hungarian and i love europe . 
  already lived in germany for a while , budapest seems like a cool place to live . 
  ( i 've travel there before ) . 
  as a bonus i can get citizenship if i learn enough of the language . 
  i 'm going to reverse that a bit !, 
  i 'm coming to live there as soon as i can !, 
  ugly on the inside , too . 
  just went on a few short road trips and decided to just have american cars cause i would n't ever have a chance to drive them any other time . 
  i wo n't do that again . 
  what ? 
  but they did invade spain !, 
  i do n't know what you mean ? 
  i 'm already part-time dead . 
  or just make a second level of streets/walkways, 
  dark streets suck . 
  you have to travel so far to just get some sunlight then , unless the grid is orientated in a certain way . 
  right . 
  i just assumed without looking . 
  oops . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  well this is mapporn so i guess like maps of trains . 
  or trains of maps . 
  yeah but the one with the `` grab them by the dick '' poster totally looks like a young jeb bush . 
  tbh if i was to write phonetically how my young niblings pronounce `` little '' it 'd be `` leedle '' . 
  ca n't seem to see / r/australia anywhere for some strange reason . 
  anyway ours [ is this one ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/mj-ruwad0dlyegufc5r2jvmmbfbbhpnanjlz3sywn-4.png?w=698&amp;s=910412f545c66a1266d0c21543e6bb18 ) . 
  russia appears to be taking georgia 's land 2.54 centimetres by 2.54 centimetres, 
  i always wonder what the hell do they talk about while they 're eating . 
  rip in peace . 
  not many people would know this one , it 's `` english '' : welcome , brother . 
  please, 
   sergei aksyonov , prime minister of the autonomous republic of crimea since it was annexed by russia , has proposed that putin be made president of the russian federation for life . 
  pretty sure that 's what he 's aiming for anyway . 
  finally an outsider who can shake things up a little bit . 
  nah you see she explained something and putin is like `` no it does n't '' and explaining an alternative to whatever it is and merkel eye rolls . 
  could be america 's missile shield . 
  we need a subreddit like / r/lipreadinghelp where you can post things like this and people who can lipread will tell you what they 're saying . 
  how to get over walls ? 
  what 's the water like there ? 
  is it nice in summer or is it always cold ? 
  150 mps in the house of reps ( green ) and 76 senators ( red ) . 
  they 're both made to be able to be expanded much beyond that ( see the empty space around them ) . 
  remember australia is only ~ 24 million people . 
  ~ ~ too small i think . ~ ~ edit : just looked it up . 
  looks like the old one was just provisional and the new one was the permanent one . 
  just took ages to decide on what and where to build it . 
   federal parliament meetings were first held in melbourne until 1927 . 
  between 1927 and 1988 , the parliament of australia met in the provisional parliament house , which is now known as `` old parliament house '' . 
  construction of australia 's permanent parliament house was delayed while its location was debated . 
  construction of the new building began in 1981 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/parliament_house,_canberra#new_parliament_house, 
  really ? 
  cause these are fairly recent , built around 1988 . 
  or do you just mean the westminster style layout ? 
  [ this is the old one , which i think looks more english ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/house_of_representatives%2c_old_parliament_house%2c_canberra.jpg ),

  there 's one of these for everyone , 
  / r/actuallyitwasdoneonpurpose, 
  it 's made on purpose . 
  it 's from busted tees : http://www.bustedtees.com/greece  here 's the funny thing . 
  even though we put this description on here explaining that we know that 's not the flag for greece and that 's the joke , we 'll still get about two or three emails a week telling us that we 're idiots for mixing up countries . 
  i love the onion 's take on these sort of comics : http://www.theonion.com/features/editorial-cartoon,
