yeah definitely . 
  i 'm not saying its a permanent or sustainable solution but it 's a good stopgap solution whilst we get our shop in order . 
  that and if we switched to nuclear , it would drop ghg emissions significantly * now * ( well on a short-medium term time scale anyway ) rather than the current bickering we have over carbon prices or future technologies . 
  australia has zero nuclear powerplants . 
  the public opinion is against it . 
  just a little over the ocean , new zealand took the step of declaring themselves a nuclear free zone . 
  it makes less economical sense in australia since we have bucketloads of plentiful coal but then again , we also have bucketloads of uranium so it balances out . 
  i 'm not saying nuclear is a sustainable solution forever but its a great stopgap measure while we work on more advanced technologies and its one that allows us to take action on ghg emission * now * . 
  thanks for the video by the way , i added it to the [ til ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1p6xam/til_that_nuclear_power_prevented_an_average_of/ ) i made about the link i posted above . 
  according to [ nasa ] ( http://climate.nasa.gov/news/903 ) ( and pretty much everyone else who is authoritative on this ) nuclear power actually takes far fewer lives than coal which causes air pollution ( massive effect on health across a country ) and coal mining tragedies . 
   using historical electricity production data and mortality and emission factors from the peer-reviewed scientific literature , we found that despite the three major nuclear accidents the world has experienced , nuclear power prevented an average of over 1.8 million net deaths worldwide between 1971-2009 ( see fig . 
  this amounts to at least hundreds and more likely thousands of times more deaths than it caused . 
  an average of 76,000 deaths per year were avoided annually between 2000-2009 ( see fig . 
  2 ) , with a range of 19,000-300 ,000 per year . 
  / r/firstworldanarchists is that way . 
  australia 's defense strategy ( i shit you not ) is hold out long enough until the americans show up . 
  being so close to asia and the emerging powers of china and india , we would be screwed in the event they boiled over and we did n't have a major military power protecting us . 
  each country has a different political centre and culture though . 
  they might be right ( i dont know about many modern day far right parties ) for the norwegian political spectrum . 
  our right wing party , the liberal party , is probably significantly left of the us democrats but i would n't dream comparing them . 
  just out of interest , what are their `` eyebrow-raising ideas '' ? 
  i think we have to be careful about how we label things . 
  if we start labeling everything right of ourselves `` far right '' ( or vice-versa for left ) it really dilutes the significance of the term to ridiculous hyperbole . 
  australia had this problem too . 
  people were comming over on dangerous boats , often on false promises by people smugglers that they would be granted australian residency once they made it to shore . 
  the previous administration attempted to fix this by saying that anyone who arrives by boat will never be granted australian residency and will be sent to be a refugee in png ( geographically close to australia ) . 
  obviously , refugees are a serious issue but we cant allow people to get the message that jumping on unseaworthy craft and seeing so many deaths is an automatic win either . 
  that said , it 's obviously best to cut it off at the source and increase refugee intake through legitimate channels . 
  * candiate * obama would really tear * president * obama to shreds . 
  takes me 2 hours to get to uni in victoria but that 's with 2x trains and 2x buses . 
  oh wow , id hang that on a wall somewhere . 
  our beautiful passports make up for the shitty looking ballots though . 
  i belong to a left-wing party and they argue it is n't illegal . 
  i 'm no law expert but i 've heard plenty of people say it is n't `` illegal '' to seek asylum , so , they very well could be kind of legal . 
  your solution sounds pretty good . 
  i think it should involve funding attatched to it though , only seems somewhat fair . 
  if you pay to set up processing camps in turkey , etc it could work . 
  even on the peripheral states of europe but i could see how that would go wrong . 
  i 'm not even sure of the point of having them out of the country anymore except it would be so politically charged to move them back that it just wo n't happen . 
  there are a few on the mainland used for people already overstaying their visas and things . 
  never said anything about it being humanitarian ( word not even present ) . 
  the sole point i was trying to make was these places only really maintained the sheen of stability because of having a brutal dictator . 
  they were always shitty places people wanted to leave , except with a dictator like that it was much harder to do so . 
  i 'm on the left wing of politics and i despise what they did to allende . 
  oh my bad , cheers for the information . 
  do n't worry , thats the maximum size the government contracted printers could produce . 
  to make up for it they just kept using smaller and smaller fonts . 
  in some states with very long ballots , magnifying glasses were provided . 
  i wish i were making this up . 
  i think a tiny bit of it is the legacy of keynes . 
  he of course advocated government spending and debt in times of recession . 
  it 's difficult to take this to high levels if you ca n't print your own currency ( see greece ) . 
  wow that paper looks of such nice quality , the australian ones are printed on really shitty paper . 
  i cant blame them though since the latest ballot [ was something like 2m long .

  pay money to set up refugee camps in somewhere like turkey . 
  if you arrive `` illegally '' to australia by boat you are almost certainly sent to a refugee camp on islands ( etc ) that australia rents from other countries . 
  i 'm on the left wing in the australia political spectrum ( green party ; but it actually has parliamentary seats and is n't a joke ) . 
  my party is very against this idea and it is very expensive ( $ 250,000 / year/person ) but i suppose if it is only temporary it will take the heat off places like munich where it 's totally flooded . 
  this is all of course predicated on turkey , etc wanting them . 
  the australian camps are also sort of prison like , so , unless the eu ones are , people will just walk out and go to germany anyway . 
  is there any real good solution at the root though ? 
  i mean what can you really do ? 
  an eu wide benefit system for individuals would be incredibly complex and politically flammable . 
  i just ca n't see it happening . 
   if the eu implemented an australia-like immigration / asylum policy , there would be no need to close schengen . 
  but of course , germany is against that for some reason i do n't understand . 
  it kind of only really works because we 're an island though . 
  a lot of it anyway . 
  the specific australian situation of renting land in another country and putting them there is also outrageously expensive . 
  it 's something like $ 250,000 ( aud ) per person , per year . 
  people argue it would just be cheaper to allow them in the mainland community . 
  a big part of the political hysteria has been over `` boat people '' , most australians do n't even really think about refugees arriving by other methods . 
  a lot of the policy has been tailored towards this end . 
  the government has bought ads in newspapers in pakistan , indonesia , etc with things like this : * http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/5/8/8/o/image.related.articleleadnarrow.300x0.258jl.png/1346605200000.jpg * http://i.dawn.com/primary/2014/10/543793bf22cbd.jpg?r=1513049996, 
  stability was only kept because they were all under the thumb of brutal dictators . 
  sure , it was stable but they were n't nice places to live and i 'm pretty sure way more people would have fled if it was n't for the secret police and things like that . 
  of course war makes it exponentially worse but these places were really baskets of firewood soaked in petrol about ready to burst any second . 
  sparse for a reason though , almost all the australia population lives very close to the coast/river systems . 
  it 's really almost entirely stuck to the outer rim of the country . 
  [ check out where all the capital cities are on a map . 
  ] ( http://www.ozshots.com/special/map/thumbnails/map.jpg ) pure density of people/km is a very misleading measure for a place like australia , canada , etc. 
  i 've seen those bumper stickers around . 
  this actually may shock you ( hold on to your seat ) but [ the people ] ( http://starterpackbuilder.com/uploads/photo/avatar/4174/medium_1431993415.png ) that have them actually care very little about infrastructure policy , water tables , population density or demographics ... :p . 
  what if its because people dont want to give them jobs ? 
  *** regardless of your position on the greece issue , it is a rather interesting competition i think . 
  [ here is the wikipedia link to read more about it .

  followed shortly afterwards by public announcement that the changeover to the new currency will take place on d-day . 
  closure of domestic banks and financial markets . 
  ** over the weekend : ** authorities announce new policy regime including inflation targeting , tough fiscal rules and outlawing of wage indexation . 
  government redenominates its debt and starts negotiations over the terms of this debt . 
  legal issues clarified as far as possible , with plan announced for resolution of those issues that remain . 
  commissioning of new notes and coins . 
  ** d-day ( monday ) : ** at 00:01 hours , the drachma is introduced at parity with the euro .
