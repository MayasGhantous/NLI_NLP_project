you 've misunderstood my post . 
  yes , pragmatically greece only has two options , well 3 . 
  but academically , the austerity option the ez is putting forward is bad economic thinking . 
  i 'm not suggesting greece had options , i 'm suggesting the ez lifeline , so to speak , is suboptimal . 
  i should have put a caveat in my post . 
  greece needs to spend money ( on responsible growth ) and undergo serious structural reform . 
  i can appreciate why people are reluctant to write a blank cheque to greece to turn the ship around ( in fact i understand the political pressures in doing so ) , but further cuts in government spending and fire-sale privatisations are not the answer for greece . 
  after the four months are up , if syriza make decent reforms , the only reason the troika would not renegotiate more generously would be 100 % political . 
  there 's no economic basis for the policy in greece right now , it 's political due to voters in other countries and a distrust on the part of greece to reform . 
  to paraphrase one of varoufakis ' books . 
  * a lot of economic modelling is religion with maths * . 
  but the consensus of economists is that recessions require spending , not savings . 
  fiscal policy is a proven winner . 
  continuing austerity in greece in its present form is a political decision , not a rational economic one . 
  good . 
  greece needs to conclusively decide whether it 's going to accept a program that gives ambiguous promises to debt write offs and stay in a financial union that * perhaps * is more damaging in the long-term than charting its own course , in exchange for loans . 
  or whether it is going to reject that program , dictate a write-off to its creditors , struggle through the fall-out and rebuild itself * probably * outside of the eurozone . 
  these are the options that are put before the people of a democratic nation and whatever the majority choose , i respect your rights to do so and wish you the best of luck . 
  raw gdp growth , yes . 
  but gdp is just a number , why should we blindly chase more of just one metric ? 
  the real question is whether every day people and not the super-wealthy have benefited from globalisation ; and that answer is not so clear . 
  these western euro governments do n't have a leg to stand on accusing greece of accessing private tax data of citizens . 
  not when they run first rate domestic spying operations that feeds data back to the us . 
   and many of my friends agree such a compelling argument , it 's dumbfounding how the consensus of the elders of thepoarter has not managed to sway the eurozone in this direction . 
  interesting read , you do a good job explaining how difficult a task ` ending cronyism ' is . 
  some other europeans seem to think you just tap dance in and say no a few times and it disappears . 
  and after greece goes another weakest link will need culling , repeat until only 3 nations are left ... 
  the title is correct as is . 
  tsipras voted down his idea to issue ious to the banks , cut the cords from the ecb and keep using euros . 
  i 'd argue that tsipras was in the wrong here . 
  the subtext of the referendum was grexit , and most were on board to tempt fate with the varoufakis plan . 
  instead tsipras secured a worse deal than any previous deal with oversight of a sovereign democracy by foreign bank representatives . 
  varoufakis resigned as he said he would in the past ( see the video of him meeting with christian democrats ) as he would n't sign another ` extend and pretend ' deal . 
  the euroskeptics were right all along and the pro eu people were the delusional ones . 
  if greek gdp shrinks another 20 % , too bad greeks ca n't hold an election on leaving the ez , the creditors run athenian democracy now . 
  i do n't think `` germany '' is the villain is this narrative , nor do i think many people see germans as villains in this regard . 
  in fact , the average german is a much a victim as the average greek . 
  their political leaders ( merkel and sch\u00e4uble ) took their tax money without asking , threw it at a corrupt banking system ( who racked up nearly 1 trillion in shit quality assets ) , squeezed the `` piigs '' to pay back for the german/franco bank-bailouts , then spun a narrative whereby the ` basket case greeks and other * `` piigs '' * ' caused this crisis . 
  then , they used their power as leaders of larger nations to circumvent the local democracies in these other european nations of ` equals ' to enforce bad economics that for the longest time kept inflation down to sustain german exports . 
  so i will forever see merkel and schauble as villains in this narrative . 
  and yes , i view pasok and the other unaccountable domestic politicians who over-borrowed as fucking shit heads too . 
   `` they crucified tsipras in there , '' a senior eurozone official who had attended the summit remarked . 
  `` crucified . '' funny , tsipras is a product of the troika 's austerity regime in athens . 
  he 's the pm they all deserve . 
  they 're looking eye-to-eye with a figure of their own making . 
   to potami would be one . 
  my understand was syriza refused a coalition with them them due to a connection they have with a broadcaster maybe ( and likewise to potami refused coalition in return ) ? 
  still , we 're in weird territory now , so perhaps now a coalition is possible . 
  however , if anel end the existing coalition , my understanding is syriza need to make a new one or go to elections . 
  greek parliament can not vote on this issue without a government . 
   he will have to rush key measures on pension reforms , tax increases and a debt repayment fund through parliament in 48 hours . 
  it will be a bruising process . 
  so nd , to potami and pasok all vote yes : 106 votes anel will surely break rank on this , leaving syriza with 149 seats . 
  can they get the 45 votes they need ? 
  i do n't see how greece wo n't go to elections over this . 
  the syriza/anel coalition is surely over . 
   the draft document demands that greece submit proposed legislation to its creditors for approval before making it public . 
  and there is your europe that you all deserve . 
  large banks ( who bare the largest share of the blame in this crisis ) get a veto over the people of an entire nation . 
  trust goes both ways , why should greece hand over the keys to the car to the creditors when their program had contracted the economy by one third and resulted in debt to gdp of 180 % , unemployment of nearly 30 % and youth unemployment over 50 % ? 
  what would make the greek people think that this foreign invasion would be in their best interests ? 
  or do you all simply not care how citizens feel about it ? 
   syriza has constantly acted in ways that show that they believe no matter what they do , the rest of the eurozone will see them as `` too big to fail . '', 
  who do they think they are deutsche bank or soci\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ? 
   there are serious concerns regarding the sustainability of greek debt . 
  this is due to the easing of policies during the last 12 months , which resulted in the recent deterioration in the domestic macroeconomic and financial environment . 
  delusional and they know they 're wrong to boot thanks to . 
  imf papers ... sustainability issues were achieved by extended a loan in 2012 to an insolvent entity and demanding measures to curtail growth . 
  but anyway , i do n't see how tsipras can survive this . 
  he not only failed in his mandate , he authorised the invasion of athens by foreign powers to forcefully implement their program . 
  greece runs a deep trade deficit , buying in most of their goods from europe . 
  in the short term , this will really hurt the average greek as they have to buy euros with their drachma to get just necessities . 
  also , any assets like superannuation , savings etc will become next to worthless overnight when they 're converted to the drachma . 
  not to say there are n't positives , but do n't forget the negatives either . 
  personally i think greece should be jumping at the option to leave the ez . 
  especially if they 'll get help printing the currency . 
  i just would n't return the the euro ever . 
  the greek people are a victim of cronyism and corruption , from the greek political class , big domestic-based business and big western european banks who are `` too big to fail '' . 
  but politics , rules blah blah blah . 
  how can we possibly help people and do sound economics when words on paper say otherwsie ? 
  do you think most people will feel this way ? 
  that by voting no , he was giving the mandate to leave the eurozone ( by refusing to accept any new deals with the troika ) if negotiations did n't advanced past where they were ? 
  irrespective of what happens with this proposal ( accepted or rejected ) i hope tsipras et al really reform the taxation system and stamp out the cronyism so that the youth of greece can have a fair chance at life , instead of having to prop up the corrupt elite at home ( and abroad , as it stands today ) . 
  i also hope some other europeans smarten up and drop their racist rhetoric against greeks , as well as their * tough guy * ` well , the parties over and the bill has come in ' . 
  here 's why you need to ease up on greek people :  according the bank of international settlements , by 2010 when the crisis hit , french banks held the equivalent of nearly ** 465 billion euros ** in so-called impaired periphery assets , while german banks had ** 493 billion ** on their books . 
  only a small part of those impaired assets were greek , and here 's the rub : greece made up two percent of the eurozone in 2010 , and ** greece 's revised budget deficit that year was 15 percent of the country 's gdp -- that 's 0.3 percent of the eurozone 's economy . 
  in other words , the greek deficit was a rounding error , not a reason to panic ** . 
  [ \\ [ src \\ ] ] ( https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/greece/2015-07-07/pain-athens ) the reckless spendthrifts you 're looking at are bankers in germany and france . 
  greek people are not your enemies and nor are german people . 
  the enemy is banks who apparently can not accept losses on bad bets they make , so their losses must be socialised . 
  hopefully one day soon the ez smartens up and ends the indentured servitude of people , all to pay back banks who knowingly made bad bets . 
  probably not as greece has already made a lot of reforms under tough conditions and been derided as ` not trying ' . 
  any proposal by the creditors that does n't include ** concrete measures ** on how the greek economy will grow , rather than just forecasting growth out of there assess , should be rejected by the greek side . 
  even if it means having to use the iou system to stabilise from the fallout . 
  do n't let this ` slashing spending to grow ' farce go on any longer . 
  syriza and varoufakis in particular said it was a mistake . 
  the whole reason they 're getting loans is to vicariously bailout all the near insolvent banks in the eurozone . 
  i mean seriously , what kind of idiots give an insolvent entity a loan ? 
  then why did you pay them in 2012 ? 
  oh wait , western europe wanted the money back it took off their tax payers and threw into the banking system which knowingly made bad loans ...
