sounds effective to me, 
  how are you going to do that ? 
  your perception is shaped by the modern world , it 's impossible not to look back at history through a modern lens . 
   not really interested in discussing things with people who use '' ner ner , you 're having an emotion , i win '' to sidetrack the argument , sorry . 
  yes ? 
  not really interested in discussing things with people who use '' ner ner , you 're having an emotion , i win '' to sidetrack the argument , sorry . 
  downplay the scale of it all you like , but writing off a country of starving people because '' god '' and '' they deserve it '' is fundamentally evil . 
  i 'm quite glad to have the ability to be emotional about a million senseless deaths , actually . 
   that 's not true at all though . 
  the irish population exploded during the period during which potatoes became the staple crop ( from under 3 million to over 8 million ) . 
  ... that has nothing to do with what i said , and it 's well established that being forced onto small plots and marginal land made irish farmers [ artificially dependent on potatoes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_famine_\\ ( ireland \\ ) #potato _ dependency ) which is the whole reason the blight was so devastating to their crops . 
   you ignore the fact that the uk government shipped more food into ireland and ? 
  it sure as shit was n't going to the poor people , they were all dying . 
   vast quantities of food were brought in the relieve the famine , too late for many people but clearly with the objective of saving lives , not taking them . 
  '' many people '' . 
  are you kidding me . 
  one million died and 1-2 million fled to find themselves in abject poverty elsewhere . 
  that egregious level of suffering does n't just happen for no damn reason . 
  the famine was hugely exacerbated in ireland by the systematic , murderous apathy of officials like trevelyan who could have done something about it . 
  the bats can roost between the gaps in the side of the bridge safely [ here is an article ] ( http://www.designboom.com/architecture/next-architects-vlotwateringbrug-bat-bridge-monster-netherlands-10-26-2015/ ), 
   the world would be a much simpler place if people would stop using history to advance contemporary agendas . 
  ... how else are we supposed to discuss modern issues without looking at history ? 
  ... they were n't though . 
  the system that was imposed on them made it practically impossible for the irish to feed themselves with anything else but potatoes , and tons upon tons of other foodstuffs were being shipped out in front of their eyes as they starved to death . 
  part of the legal definition of genocide : deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to destroy a group includes the deliberate deprivation of resources needed for the group 's physical survival , such as clean water , food , clothing , shelter or medical services . 
  deprivation of the means to sustain life can be imposed through confiscation of harvests , blockade of foodstuffs , [ ... ], 
  he was basically saying they did n't deserve famine relief because they had n't '' earned '' the right to live , it 's just fox news anti-welfare rhetoric in 1800s lingo '' if the irish once find out that there are any circumstances in which they can get free government grants , we shall have a system of mendicancy [ begging ] such as the world never knew '' -- same asshole, 
  i 'm not too terribly concerned about what a conspiracy theorist thinks of my rhetorical skills , to be honest with you it 's on the same level as a vegan telling me how to cook steak, 
  back to / r/conspiracy with you, 
   because meat is expensive , maybe ? 
  price certainly , geography might also factor into it as well . 
  notice how meat consumption roughly correlates with country size , with the smallest countries often being the darkest ? 
  easier to import/transport expensive , spoilable meat to more densely populated areas , more variety , more access . 
  all the touristy places are going to have restaurants and fast food outlets as well that vast rural areas wo n't .

  oh man , i wan na hang some of those on my wall random , but there 's a documentary called jiro dreams of sushi that 's all about one japanese dude 's total life commitment to making the world 's best sushi , and the kind of aesthetic philosophy behind it . 
  it blew my mind . 
  japan takes design aesthetic [ very seriously ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/japanese_aesthetics ) .

  they make art out of food . 
  of course the trains are gorgeous . 
  soldiers are n't police , and maintaining a distinction between the two is a very good thing if you ask me . 
  if you read the article , that 's exactly what they 're trying to do . 
   it has been confirmed that at least some victims of the blaze have been rehomed in hotels . 
  the government said 126 hotel places have been given to families while 78 were due to be homed in properties locally or in a neighbouring borough by monday night . 
  the problem is that this is an expensive logistical nightmare and not everyone has been accounted for , so they wind up on the street while waiting for help . 
  consider that it 's not just the people directly impacted by the fire who need help , but people in the surrounding areas whose homes are now unsafe due to debris . 
  if we divide # 300,000 amongst a conservative estimate of 100 survivors , that 's # 3000 each . 
  that 's really not much at all when you 're trying to feed , clothe , and replace people 's belongings . 
  this is why it 's supposed to be the government 's job to handle this shit . 
  bit hard to buy them new houses, 
  well , i suppose it 's easy to paint it as an impossible situation that inevitably '' breaches the declaration of human rights '' if you do n't know what you 're talking about and you just make shit up . 
   it would mean that certain people , no matter how they vote , can not be in government . 
  no , it means you 're not allowed to break internationally recognised treaties . 
  and the only way to decide whether it was broken or not is to take it to court . 
  that is what courts are for .
