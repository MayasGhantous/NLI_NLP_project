  the borders are all defined well enough to be clear , it is perfect for to show this kind of information . 
  nah , i mean how the borders/coasts are drawn . 
  they are simplified a lot whilst maintaining all the necessary information . 
  norway is drawn with like 10 points but still looks like norway . 
  any one know what this type of map is called ? 
  i mean the actual map , the borders/coasts . 
  the euro would 've collapsed . 
  you ca n't bail out greece with baguettes and ciabatta you need good heavy german bread that can be used as building material . 
  come to poland , your car is already there . 
  i would say southern europeans ( wogs ^ & ) are a separate category . 
  ^ & not necessarily a racist term in australia, 
  sure , but they are , or at least were , made by greeks . 
  huh , in australia gyros and souvlaki are lamb, 
  goes by \u00c9irluru now mate . 
  the trojans should 've ignored this one . 
  plop, 
  you guys have a new king do n't you ? 
  what is his name ... 
  in the palm of prussia 's hand ... 
  brittany must be getting quite the eyefull, 
  what is the target ? 
  a percentage of budget ? 
  maybe in the long term it is better to increase the economy than meet an arbitrary spending each year . 
  there were lots .

  we have `` yeah nah '' . 
  basically `` yeah i heard you but nah you 're a fuckwit '', 
  we 'll put kylie in , she is pretty much european now anyway . 
  does the person whose birthday it is bring the cake ? 
  i will be doing this on saturday . 
  it is because of some kinds of septic tanks is n't it ? 
  not connected to the main sewage system . 
  if the hotel is up on the slopes it is n't at all surprising . 
  the english equivalent is : ` it 's not what you know but who you know ', 
  they also just banned aussie beef : http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-27/russia-bans-australian-beef-products-over-growth-stimulant/5221202, 
  if you think about it the presence of and difference between gasses are not obvious . 
  it was only in the 1700s that hydrogen , helium oxygen , nitrogen , co2 etc were isolated . 
  there was small levels of trade occurring between australia and asia . 
  this is where the dingo came from , they were introduced only 10,000 years ago . 
  lpt the baltic states are alphabetically arranged north to south .

  it is about the same number in [ australia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_australia#country_of_birth ) so it ends up being about 5 % of the population . 
  more now with the barmy army in town . 
  pretty sure they spell it ` pedofile ', 
  he was referring to the [ treaty that ended the war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_m%c3%bcnster ) , often it is discussed about as part of the [ peace of westphalia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_of_westphalia ), 
  it would be interesting to see test results from glasgow or belfast . 
  does grazing land = grass land or cropland ? 
  laws are simply there the codify the rules that the weak must abide by . 
  yeah , i use [ this ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2&amp;hl=en ) . 
  i think rotterdam brings in a lot of bulk cargo . 
  grains , oil , iron ore etc. 
  which is then shipped up the rhine and elsewhere . 
  rotterdam only has slightly more container shipments than hamburg . 
  i think most german cars are shipped out via hamburg , which you can imagine is a high value/low volume thing . 
  edit : oh and airbus may also contribute to the high value/low volume . 
  [ mr x was right !, 
  xxxx - not sure if it qualifies as beer though . 
  anything reasonably priced would be nice there . 
  australia - 1 euro beers germany - meat pies, 
   i took a poo outside in -42 c and people wonder what drove europeans to conquer the rest of the world . 
  just quietly , i think australians and norwegians have different definitions of ` winter ' . 
  you got a job offer in portugal for me ? 
  this is my first european autumn and it feels so fucking ominous . 
  i 'm expecting white walkers in a month or so . 
  wow , i had no idea . 
  damn straight . 
  i ca n't get enough of it . 
  reminds me of my favourite beers back home ( little creatures pale ale amongst others ) . 
  until i found it i was quite disappointed by german beers when i got here . 
  there are so many beers that i had not tried before but when i did all tasted very similar . 
  in our lower house , where government is formed , we do n't have proportional representation ( the senate does ) . 
  so the preferential voting in the lower house , normally , gives an absolute majority . 
  a small percentage win is often skewed to the major parties in terms of number of seats . 
  each seat gets their ` most preferred candidate ' , rather than the one with the most 1st preferences . 
  minor parties obviously feel that this is unfair but personally i feel that it is a good compromise . 
  it gives people with minority views the chance to vote first for their most preferred party but if they do n't win they still get their vote counted and we ( normally ) end up with a stable , majority government, 
  [ this animation is probably the easiest way to understand it ] ( http://www.grwpub.info/senate/vic.svg ) . 
  each time a party gets over the quota they get a representative elected . 
  if no party is above the quota the party with the least number of votes is eliminated , the 2nd preference for those who voted for that party are then counted and added to the nominated party 's total . 
  rinse and repeat until someone does have the quota . 
  nb : ' 1 quota ' is equal to the total number of voters divided by 7 , not sure if it is based on the census information or formal votes or turnout ( voting is mandatory so they will all be close ) . 
  in terms of a voting system i feel that having a threshold is troublesome as where it is set is arbitrary . 
  there is some talk of bringing one in for the australian senate where we just had someone with 0.5 % of the 1st preference vote get elected . 
  this happened because the senate has preferential voting arrangements and there can be 100 + candidates for 6 seats.if 90 candidates get a combined total of 20 % and preference one other party , they get a seat . 
  if you vote directly for a party , they decide how the preferences flow . 
  if you want to decide the preferences youreself you have to rank each candidate 1 to 100 + . 
  obviously this is fascicle but i do n't think a threshold is the answer . 
  while you are correct , the australian aboriginals are not polynesian . 
  the polynesian people spread throughout the south pacific ~ 10,000 years ago and most likely encounter australia . 
  the australian aboriginals had already been there for 40,000 years or so . 
  australia was probably inhabited by homo sapiens before europe was . 
  the australian greens are a bit like this too , not as extreme , but it really pisses me off . 
  i agree with a lot of their policies , more than other parties , but some of their scientific policies are absolutely batshit insane . 
  what about a photo of yourself ? 
  i know it is common in germany ( on resumes ) . 
  i find it very odd . 
  can australia come ?
