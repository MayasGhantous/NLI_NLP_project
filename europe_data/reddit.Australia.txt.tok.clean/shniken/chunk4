  the prime minister of nz said :  it was an act of true cowardice and i consider it appropriate that the australian team were wearing yellow http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/underarm_bowling_incident_of_1981, 
  [ probably this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iknq-crir50 ) . 
  we are truly sorry . 
   got gangbanged by germans and russians in ww2 thought i was in [ this thread for a second ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1j8gom/yougov_european_sex_survey_results_infographic/ ), 
  yeah , i get the same impression in germany . 
  while there may be a lot of atheists around , religion is really important for those that identify as religious . 
  in australia , and probably the uk , a lot of people who say they are religious really are n't . 
  and it plays very little role in day to day life . 
  [ this list might be less surprising ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/importance_of_religion_by_country ), 
  left over from the ddr . 
  i would think a fair chunk of germany 's atheists are also from ` state enforced ' atheism . 
  a potato joke here is too easy . 
  in theory population should n't matter if you have an upper house that represents the states equally . 
  the population ratio between england and wales is similar to new south wales and tasmania . 
  but i guess hypothetically you could split england up [ like this ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:english_north-south_divide.png ), 
  most characters in the simpsons are named after matt groening 's family or street names in portland , where he grew up . 
  [ here is flanders street ] ( http://goo.gl/maps/oufj7 ) . 
  you can also see quimby st , lovejoy st etc, 
  i 'm not sure how the lords actually works tbh . 
  but our senate is n't really like the clusterfuck they have in the us . 
  has a ` federated kingdom ' received an discussion ? 
  i would think it is the perfect solution . 
  make each home country a state like in the us or australia . 
  get rid of the silly house of lords and get a senate the represents the states . 
  yeah , it was the san marino gp but the track was actually in imola ( italy ) . 
  this is the most important point in the thread, 
  the g20 summit is in 2 months . 
  in st petersberg . 
  snowden should attend . 
  it used to be that a commonwealth citizen could live in the uk . 
  now you have to prove that one of your grand parents was born in the uk . 
  [ shit , its a meat pie ! ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:burek_trokut_3.gif ) . 
  i would kill for one of them in germany . 
  i could n't pick what kind of accent he had until i saw his hands . 
  the holes are where the money was . 
   why they still felt the need for bullet proof glass i have no idea . 
  perhaps the nsa has an idea ... 
  the way religion is treated in public is very different . 
  in france there is a big taboo ( maybe to strong a word ) against bring religion into the public sphere . 
  yet in germany it is quite ingrained into the government , you register as a catholic or a protestant and pay taxes to the church ( for example ) . 
  in the uk this would seem very strange despite them having an official , established church with the queen as its leader . 
  yes a lot of young people in those three countries are atheists but the way it is treated is very different . 
  australia has some very [ colourful notes ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_banknotes#current_series_.28polymer.29 ) . 
  it is common to call them by their colour [ `` here is a pink one '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/36/australian_%245_polymer_back.jpg ) or by something that is the same colour [ `` give me a pineapple '' ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/australian_%2450_polymer_front.jpg ) or by the picture on it [ ` give me a banjo ' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/australian_10_dollar_note ) dollars are normally called bucks . 
  money is ` dosh ' , `` got any spare dosh ? '', 
  i 've heard it is from latin ; `` quid pro quo '', 
  yeah , i 'm not really familiar with either sports . 
  but they both kind of look like full contact soccer with a ball and stick rather than with feet . 
  i always thought it was similar to lacrosse , but without the net in the stick . 
  i 've heard there is quite a religious division between the codes of gaelic , rugby and association football . 
  perhaps this is more evident in northern ireland though . 
  a number of gaelic football players come to australia to play australian football . 
  it is somewhat similar in rules . 
  the most famous was jim stynes who was a great player , and a great man . 
  every few years australia and ireland play a hybrid game . 
  i believe there are some scheduled for october this year in ireland . 
   famous for soccer and oranges valencia is in spain . 
  not at all ? 
  i 've never been to portugal but i 've been to a few restaurants that claim to be portuguese and they seem to be fairly close to nandos . 
  like nandos is really just spicy chicken . 
  is that not a thing is portugal ? 
  i did know it was n't actually from portugal but i thought it came from england . 
  still i 've had some actual portuguese chicken and it is pretty close . 
  did n't mean to make light of that at all . 
  the balibo five was just a massive story from this invasion . 
  their withdrawal from east timor after this revolution caused a lot of dramas . 
  afterwards the indonesians invaded . 
  [ murdered five australian journalists ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balibo_five ) and did n't grant the timorese independence til 2002 . 
  and they have a really really old alliance with old blighty . 
  probably just high powered lasers . 
  quite a few laser manufactures here . 
  for some reason inspector rex ( as we call it ) is really big in australia ( the one that does have kangaroos ) . 
  there was a parody news show ( like the daily show ) that had fake advertisements , including promos for [ inspektor herring ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yils2tffrbw ) ... 
  perhaps this is true . 
  we really do n't like to admit we are like those people though . 
  around the same time as prohibition in the states australia brought in laws that made pubs close at 6pm . 
  so that husbands would go home to their wives ... 
  this made the men drink as much as possible in the hour between work finishing and the pubs closing . 
  so the law was a smashing success . 
  ( btw , the only armed takeover of an australian government was over alcohol : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rum_rebellion ), 
  the brits just * want * to queue , it is sort of a game of chicken as to who is going to actually move and who gets to wait . 
  ( also it is * im * practical ), 
  we do to . 
  same words , different accent . 
  it is a problem in australia too , i do n't think it is related to an inhibited culture . 
  not sure why we do it but we do ... 
  i 've been to glasgow , pretty sure they do n't speak english . 
  i 'm from melbourne , you never get the tarantulas there . 
  we do get huntsmen spiders but they are harmless and they actually feed on cockroaches and other stuff so you leave them be . 
  one possible etymology of the term `` pom '' is that you folk turned a bright red , like a pomegranate soon after your arrival . 
  in australia the two most deadly things are the sun and the surf . 
  no one has died from spider bites since antivenom has been available . 
  and it is the small ones that you should be worried about . 
  in germany pepperoni are chilli peppers . 
  in australia we had/have a campaign to `` slip , slop , slap '' ( slip on a t-shirt , slop on sunscreen and slap on a hat ) to prevent skin cancer . 
  i 'm now living in hamburg and this advice is totally , depressingly irrelevant . 
  in 1905 the island of new guinea was controlled by three countries . 
  the dutch east indies included the western half of this island . 
  the eastern half was split north/south between germany ( deutsch-neuguinea ) in the north and britain ( papua ) in the south .
