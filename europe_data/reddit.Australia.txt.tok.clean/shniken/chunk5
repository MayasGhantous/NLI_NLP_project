  in 1906 britain signed over control of papua to the newly united country of australia . 
  in 1914 australia invaded german new guinea and from 1919 it administered both as territories ( the territory of new guinea and the territory of papua ) under a league of nations mandate . 
  in 1941 japan invaded the island of new guinea as well as much of se asia . 
  at its closest , papua is about 150km from the australian mainland and there was a lot of fear that this would be used as a base to invade the mainland . 
  after the war the eastern half of the island was administered as the un trust [ terrirory of papua and new guinea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territory_of_papua_and_new_guinea ) . 
  while most of the dutch east indies became '' `` independent '' '' as indonesia , the dutch held onto the [ netherlands new guinea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/netherlands_new_guinea ) until 1962 when they handed over control to the un which ` allowed ' indonesia to annex it in 1969 . 
  papua and new guinea voted to become independent of australia in 1975 , thus eliminating australia 's only international land border . 
  from 1906 to 1914 australia had a land border with both germany and the netherlands .

  i was aware of them as a buddhism symbol , it is used a lot in japan and korea . 
  but i did n't know there was much use of it in europe prior to the nazis . 
   the swastika was used as the official national marking of the finnish defence forces between 1918 and 1945 . 
  really ? 
  they used the swastika before the germans ? 
  to answer my own question : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika#finland, 
  civil war ? 
  i believe they announced that churchill would be on the note on anzac day ( 25th ) . 
  which was quite insensitive tbh ... 
  in hamburg and there is some church day ( kirchentag ) on wednesday . 
  no idea what it is all about ... 
   we do n't need no education, 
  well not too long ago 28 million euros was pretty much equal to 50 million usd, 
  kinda wish that was broken up by state ... 
  it is n't really accurate . 
  wikipedia has an uncited claim that they have nearly 75 % [ `` of the daily metropolitan circulation '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/news_limited#influence_in_australia ) . 
  i tried to find a source on it but it is a bit hard to search for information about newspapers without getting those newspapers in the search results ... 
  while this is distressing it is really that they sell more than their rivals . 
  most states have an alternative daily paper , but some do not . 
  does this include asians ? 
  ( indonesians ? ), 
  goddamn germany .

  we took over some of your colonies for a short time : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_australia_during_world_war_i#german_new_guinea after that australia had a land border with the netherlands until they lost their colony to indonesia and papua new guinea became independent .

  malta was ruled by the normans for some time right ? 
  who were originally vikings ... so they brought the name with them ? 
  so slot = ` palace ' and borg = fort ? 
  have you heard an irishman speak ? 
  it is n't english . 
  perhaps a stupid question , but what does this mean ? 
  will they also be joining the schengen area ? 
  not the euro though ? 
  do they get more eurovision votes ? 
  there are dozens of them !, 
  yeah , sorta , the ultimate aim is to kill all of those . 
  with roos it is just to keep the numbers down . 
  similar issue in australia , but with roos . 
  when there is lots of water around they breed very quickly . 
  i just moved here , have n't really looked . 
   / u/brain4breakfast perhaps you are the cause ? 
  i had this all the time in australia , i 'll have to find somewhere here ( hamburg ) to get it . 
  bland . 
  this is probably a good point , many foreigners are probably not shopping in the right places ... i 've only been here 2 weeks ( hh if that matters ) i 've mainly been to supermarkets . 
   apparently it 's also not uncommon to get paid ` off the books ' to save on taxes - just like at home !, 
  yeah there are lots of italians ( and greeks ) in australia . 
  it depends on a lot of things . 
  i 've just moved to germany and my immediate reaction is that fresh foods are more expensive ( and less varied ) but prepackaged food is much cheaper . 
  a bag of chips ( crisps ) , coke , milk and obviously beer are very cheap in germany . 
  but fresh meat ( horse/beef or chicken ) , fruit/vegetables are about the same price in euros as aussie dollars . 
  electronics also differ a lot . 
  computer components ( video cards/hard drives etc ) are more expensive due to the sales tax ( 19 % ? 
  vs 10 % in aus ) . 
  things like tvs can vary a lot in australia because big stores have to buy a lot of them and if they do n't sell soon the new model comes in and they are fucked ( this is a problem in australia because of the small market and isolated location ) . 
  rent is also high so at some stores it adds a significant amount to the price . 
  a lot of price differences are perfectly understandable . 
  i do n't expect a mango to be as good or as cheap in hamburg as in brisbane . 
  sometimes it is due to the minimum wage or rent increasing the price , sometimes it is just companies ripping people off . 
  tax is also an issue , the tax on alcohol in australia is very high . 
  ca n't be stuffed doing it . 
  there ai n't much of real value anyway . 
  if they find some oil or something we might liberate them . 
  do you mean west austria ?

   phd in physics her phd was in quantum chemistry , on the calculation of reaction rate constants . 
  this is somewhere in between physics and chemistry , ` molecular physics ' or ` physical chemistry ' depending on which side of the fence you are on . 
  her husband is in this field too . 
   for change , ask the german embassy is that a pun in greek too ? 
  the biggest source of ground water in australia is [ the great artesian basin ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_artesian_basin ) . 
  some of the water in there is 2 million years old . 
  so , yes it is being used faster than it is being replaced it but contains a simply absurd amount of water , 65,000 cubic kilometres . 
  this is almost exclusively used for farming , all the major cities in australia use reservoirs , not ground water , for drinking water . 
  it can mean both , at least in australia . 
  one of my favourite words with multiple meanings is ` flog ' . 
  it can mean to sell something or to steal something .
