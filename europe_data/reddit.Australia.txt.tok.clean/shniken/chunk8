  can i gloat ? 
  i 'll get a couple of mates and take em both on, 
  the homosexuals . 
  lets hope there will be eurovision in 2032, 
  remembering ? 
  i suspect that is the first time many had heard of such a place . 
  beer or wine ? 
  i figured i would reply here too . 
  i do n't mind the queen herself but her husband and eldest son are fucking idiots . 
  they are prime examples of why monarchies can be bad , idiots get exposure and power because of who their parents are . 
  not saying only happens in a monarchy but the thought if charlie big ears being our king just makes me angry . 
  i feel as though australia needs to get rid of the monarchy at some point but i 'm not sure what form would be best . 
  history of being awesome ? 
  southern hemisphere is best hemisphere . 
  it appears that this was reversed in australia . 
   by italian government estimates , fully two-fifths of its emigrants to australia were from the veneto and another two-fifths were drawn from the piedmont , lombardy and tuscany regions . 
  only one-fifth were from sicily and calabria '' http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_australian perhaps this is why we got coffee and america got pizza ?

  london grand prix ? 
   most people are n't saying this . 
  i have n't really been following the whole reaction to this event , i certainly did n't mean to extrapolate to all americans . 
  i was mainly commenting on that thread in particular . 
  that was the first ` american ' thread i had really looked at . 
  [ this comment thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wys8n/jason_alexander_on_aurora/c5hnz0u ) and [ this one ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/wys8n/jason_alexander_on_aurora/c5hnpnf ) make up a large proportion of the comments in there and they are both just talking about interpreting the 2nd amendment . 
  in earlier events ( virginia tech for example which i followed a bit more closely ) there are arguments on both sides of gun control that are just interpreting the 2nd amendment differently . 
  i just do n't agree with that type of law making . 
  a good law now may not a good law in 200 years . 
  yes laws should n't be changed on a whim or in a knee-jerk response but even though the us constitution is a fantastic basis for laws the writers could not have imagined the 21st century . 
  i just find it silly that someone would argue the point by citing a guy that died 200 years ago . 
  one * should argue what the law ** should ** be not what it is . 
  you make some very good points in the second part of your comment , especially about trust which i think is very central to the whole argument , but i was mainly trying to make the point about how they were arguing their position , not what their position was . 
  * not trying to sound pretentious by using ` one ' , just did n't want it to sound like i was putting words in your mouth . 
  reddit superstar ron paul suggested issuing letters of reprisal against osama bin laden . 
  there is so much pointless arguing about the 2nd amendment in that thread . 
  what does it matter what a 200 year old piece of paper says ? 
  do n't hide behind it , if you think everyone has the right to own assault rifles say it . 
  do n't say ` the founders believed everyone has the right ... ', 
  so they should only be illegal after someone has committed a crime with them ? 
  i stayed away from all the threads on this for this reason . 
  i remember the virginia tech shootings and ( one of ) the main response to it from americans was that the university had banned guns from the campus and that is why it was so bad . 
  their logic was that they needed more guns . 
  they wanted the students there to be armed so that if someone decided to go on rampage the students go defend themselves . 
  the whole reaction to that was just mind blowing . 
  it is as if they have some kind of hero complex where they want to go dirty harry on the bad guys . 
  there is a strong ` every man for themselves ' attitude which is draped under the veil of ` freedom ' . 
  they want the wild west back . 
  [ martin bryant ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_bryant ) also bought his guns legally . 
  he was severely mentally retarded . 
  for all the shit things john howard did at least he gave us sensible gun laws . 
  appropriate name though . 
  perhaps , it did start getting popular when you started beating us at cricket . 
  for some reason eurovision is really popular in australia , a tv station sends hosts over there every year and they interview the ` artists ' . 
  they run there own voting competition , even though the votes do n't count towards anything . 
  any attempt to explain why it is popular here would break all rules of logic and reason . 
  compared to the swiss or austrian alps ours are closer to hills .

  ... hang on , you might be onto something here, 
  actually * our * schnitzels are better than all of yours . 
  and the holy roman empire was n't holy , roman nor an empire .

  ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0515221/quotes ), 
   the firefighters outside the cities are all volunteers same in australia . 
  with our bushfires people would totally fucked if not for people volunteering to put themselves in danger . 
  i assume it is volunteering for the organisation of sports ( umpiring/coaching/administration etc ), 
  i am quite sure that scots can not speak english . 
  i 'm not sure if it is a term in other languages but ` black sheep ' is a term in english that is used to describe ` the odd one ' . 
  i initially reacted to the ad as the white sheep ( plural ) kicking out the ` odd one ' . 
  i can see how it has racial undertones , the idiom itself probably does . 
  but out of context ( i do n't know german ) i did n't take it as racist . 
  ... am i missing something ? 
  is n't that the same image ? 
  i 've found that talking about the legality of abortion is quite meaningless . 
  you need to know the actual acceptability of abortion . 
  many nations abortion `` illegal except when the woman 's life or health is endangered by the continuation of pregnancy '' but the health part includes mental/emotional health so the de facto law is that any woman can get an abortion . 
  however the opposite can be true too , that same exception can be interpreted as ` immediate life threatening physical health ' . 
   french authorities are very lax you can stop there . 
  fuck , when did us aussies start working so fucking much . 
  no `` grease found in greece '' puns yet ? 
  has a federation approach been considered in the uk at all ? 
  because of some guy called alexander ... 
  customs and fishing i think are the main ( serious ) points . 
  i think fishing territories are the main sticking points with norway and iceland . 
   change it to tea and there 's no shade dark enough to represent us . 
  cheers , nice write up . 
  the stages of competition did confuse me . 
  and i did notice that tactic , we have a similar thing in australian football , call it flooding . 
  i might try and get there in the summer ... i nearly froze to death in there . 
  i meant gaelic football yeah . 
  fuck that english game ... 
  is football or hurling bigger ? 
  i went to a double header on saturday at croke park . 
  appeared that most were there for the football, 
  uk cities are not . 
  maybe parts of london are . 
  but london is special . 
  the rules for buying , or more importantly registering , a car vary quite a bit country to country .
