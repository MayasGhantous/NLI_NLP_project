  yes . 
  what an argument . 
   i was paraphrasing your anti-feminist fearmongering . 
  again , i said nothing of the sort . 
   that 's nice . 
  words have meanings though , and ` cultural marxism ' is universally understood to be a white suprematist term . 
  except , no . 
  many people who are no ws but are opposed to feminists use it to describe their focus on gender and race when it is n't needed . 
   always them spooky feminists , huh ? 
  leaving scorched earth and castrated men in their wake !, 
  what the hell is this ? 
  did i say anything of the sort ? 
   that 's because ` cultural marxism ' in its current meaning is a conspiracy theory by white suprematists . 
  i was n't talking about that , i was talking about the focus on race and gender by feminists when there is n't a need for it , not the `` destruction of western culture '' , like supremacists . 
   what confuses me is that you attack me saying that `` gender '' is irrelevant to the discussion while you were the one that started out with a reference to some sort of strawmen feminists . 
  i was talking about feminists , who are the main proponents of the gender/race laws in britain and who are responsible for the '' ` free trip home for illegals if they want it ' policy '' , the op commented at the top . 
  feminism is n't a gender , and a did n't attack you , if it came out like that . 
  i would actually say that you attacked * me * , seeing as you called me a stormfront white supremacist . 
   ... you were the one that randomly started talking about `` feminists '' when nobody was talking about such a thing . 
  feminists have largely been pushing for these laws in britain regarding immigrants . 
   ` cultural marxism ' is a dogwhistle for white suprematists . 
  and others ca n't talk about it ? 
  i 'm not a white supremacist , so this is meaningless anyway . 
   also , someone attacking both anti-racism and feminism in one sentence can hardly be considered a `` bleeding heart liberal '' , whichever way you put it . 
  how , what has anti-racism or feminism got to do with liberalism ? 
  feminists are generally authoritarian and illiberal . 
  racism has little to do with liberalism , except with anti-discrimination laws . 
  stormfront ? 
  you what mate ? 
  i 'm a bleeding heart liberal who is vehemently anti-racist . 
  i just do n't think focusing on sex gender or race is relevant to discussion here , how is that in anyway stormfronty ? 
  well , no western nations are going around killing millions of ethnic minorities . 
  cultural marxist feminists generally demand this sort of stuff . 
  yeah , too little too late . 
  good job . 
  this whole argument falls apart because the nords do n't need a large population to keep up with germany or france , etc , in the same way australia will not need to . 
  a very simple solution is to do heavy scientific research , which they do now , and export it . 
  this is what many nations do . 
  and you are too focused on a union . 
  all these problems of wealth would be solved if no one was dependent or attached to the eu . 
  federation would retain the same economic problems with less democracy . 
  okay , it 's getting really hard to follow your posts . 
  you are spanish , live in finland , are pro federal eu , yet do n't like economic unions ? 
   one of the biggest problem of the nordics and baltics are the lack of diversity and that they need 2 million of immigrants i the next 15 years to survive . 
  not sure if sarcasm , but if it is n't that is the most stupid statement i 've read today . 
  it does n't even have to be like that . 
  i 'm vehemtly anti-eu , you can just have free trade agreements , or unions between places with similar economies or culture , eg . 
  a baltic union with lit , lat and est. 
   and not , i 'm not going nihilistic . 
  no country in europe has a bright future alone . 
  we are being eating alive for others , either emigration , asian economies , usa , or brics ... 
  it 's just a matter of time . 
  if you can not see that ... you are blind . 
  you do n't need a federal europe for that . 
  you can just have an economic union . 
  damn isis , not invading iraq !, 
  now , where 's my freedom fries ( tm ) ? 
  this ... whaaaat ? 
  i 'm going to assume you 're not that fluent with english , but whatever . 
   where ? 
  they are going to leave ? 
  i do n't know , but you said that those who do n't want to federalize europe should leave . 
  which is a silly statement . 
   there is nothing out there ? 
  just misery ... yeah . 
  i do n't know what this means . 
  are you going all nihilistic or are you getting all philosophic or something ? 
  that would literally mean that half of europe leaves . 
  good job . 
  you underestimate my power !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ schlieffen ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ plan ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ fail , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 2015 ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ worst ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ year ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ my ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ life !, 
  i thought you were talking about a nice , cozy , secluded place to take your girlfriend for the weekend in swiss bunker with a large cannon to protect yourselves against the abominable snowman , but then i realized what you were getting at ... 
   that is competely wrong . 
  the weimar government let hitler and the nsdap go right ahead - including streetfights - up and untill he launced a coup . 
  a coup for christ 's sake . 
  he then spent a total of one ( 1 ) year in jail for attempting to overthrow the government with violence and then promptly proceeded to go on with the same kind of politicking he did before . 
  the interwar period in weimar germany was intensely violent . 
  it was n't just the nazi 's fighting - communists , anarchist , right wing , all fought in the street . 
  he was only jailed for a short time because it would be political suicide not to free him , seeing as he was intensely popular . 
   the nazi party was never hindered , in fact it was fostered and helped by useful idiots like franz von papen who thought the party was so radical it 'd never find a broad base and could hence easily be controlled in a broader government . 
  did you misunderstand what i said ? 
  the hindrance helped him . 
  that was my point . 
   in fact the history of the rise of the nsdap offers nothing but arguments for the exact opposite of what you 're claiming . 
  except no . 
  that is completely wrong . 
  the nazi party , hitler in particular , was criminalized and censored by the weimar regime .
