  the only reason he got popular was because the people saw a bad government , and someone who said he would fix it . 
  if the current government is suppressing someone who wants to help when their crap , surely he must have a point ? 
  the same thing will happen again if you censor , just let the beliefs die . 
   you 'll know that precautions are being taken that ** this year , ** at least everybody who comes in is registered . 
  so last year 's no ? 
  not fucking good enough . 
  are you gon na try and get free speech for everyone , but australian comments just look like **** ? 
  probably `` eu dependent '' ? 
  because a satellite ** has ** to work and obey the mother country . 
  switzerland does not . 
  your trade would be with 70 % of the eu ... because your immediate neighbors are eu members . 
  that 's not a satellite , in the same way that australia is n't of china when they are the largest amount of our income . 
  countries constantly change laws to fit neighbors because it allows trading to flourish easier , ie . 
  consumer laws , etc. 
  does n't make you a satellite . 
  i do n't think they will stop trade , i think it gets them money . 
  they have nothing to gain except angering people doing that , having power does n't mean you have to piss people off . 
  just because england controls gibraltar does n't mean they 'll close it off because they can . 
  it 's absurd , the power is in money . 
  that 's not a satellite though . 
  a satellite is something like north cyprus , something that could n't exist without their mother 's say so , ie . 
  turkey . 
  forgot about that . 
  lol . 
  denmark still controls quite a bit though . 
  anyway , norway and switzerland . 
  they do n't have canals or straits . 
  i think a big difference between middle eastern refugees in europe compared to australia is the journey . 
  as soon as refugees enter europe , they are literally in the safest and most comforting region on earth . 
  economics vary , but it is largely a good place to live as a refugee . 
  in australia , they have to come from malaysia , burma or other poor-worker-rights regions . 
  pay is minimal and often unknown if it will come . 
  europe is a very different place , and i have no sympathy comparatively for those who enter and keep crossing european borders . 
  while they are terrible threats to liberty , government exercises rarely result in mass murder and the media and parts of the public coming out against those who reveal it . 
  at least , not yet . 
  eu satellite ? 
  because switzerland and norway are , are n't they ? 
  denmark controls all trade in and out of the baltic sea , much like the u.k with gibraltar . 
  saying they 'll be a satellite is stupid . 
  collectively , no . 
  men do , as they outnumber everyone in these droves . 
  i just left a quite lengthy comment , but of course breitbart is not allowed to be linked . 
  it was deleted . 
  in any case , search `` breitbart trump lies '' and you 'll probably see it . 
  now , i 'm a left leaner , but the incessant lies from the left here have done themselves harm in getting trump so popular . 
  and i know this is europe , but this was just off the top of my head , so i had it rather quickly . 
  the problem lies with the left . 
  the left , and their supporters such as the guardian , do n't debunk arguments , they lie . 
  when people discover the lies , they think `` everything about them is wrong ; they mus n't be racist , '' or `` the left is anti-common sense , and the final bastion against uncontrolled immigration is the right wing . '', 
  until very recently , artillery was not done by computers . 
  early cannons was done by the most recent shell 's landing point , then by actual sights . 
  up until super powered artillery in ww1/2 , there was no communication with the troops . 
  it was all sights . 
  they misidentified it , they thought it was a cargo plane . 
  have you seen an artillery piece ? 
  put shell in , fire . 
  guns are the same , just on small scale . 
  an artillery piece and a gun are operated by pulling a trigger . 
  a buk requires a lot of advance training and consists of computer work , not a simple trigger pull . 
  are you saying that rebels know how to operate a buk missile with no prior training ? 
   there was a case a few years back where a woman killed herself after being prosecuted for false allegations . 
  there was fairly good evidence against her , but news stories like that will inevitably create the impression that making a report carries a risk . 
  and men are frequently accused of rape falsely and commit suicide because of the media frenzy . 
  names should not be released to the public , until after they go to prison , if at all . 
  why the hell does the public need to be involved in police matters ? 
  so they will tell other [ scots ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iusuq4-f5u ) to fuck off !, 
  ayyylmao, 
  yes . 
  yes , but it is n't russian land yet . 
  that has nothing to do with women get lower sentences for the same crime though . 
  even if it `` discouraged '' genuine reports , it wont . 
  you can investigate if malicious intent was behind the accusation . 
  it is n't a blanket `` no evidence , you were lying , off to prison '' thing . 
  because that 's such a good idea . 
  `` captain , land ho ! '', 
  * nukes start launching *, 
   not censor ship  closes a way to speak good double think, 
  if belarus or the baltic is gone , then the line of defense rests in poland . 
  it may not have been a high cost for the continuation war , but it certainly forced the soviet 's hands . 
  i was n't talking about fair , though . 
  i was just praising the finnish efforts in trying to win back their lands . 
  sure , they lost , but at what cost a for the soviets ? 
  a damn big one . 
  it was hyperbole , but this is the potential future if feminists get their way . 
  women get decidedly lower sentences then men for the same crimes . 
  yes . 
  continually throughout college campuses they have been trying to get students expelled on the mere assertion of rape , without trial . 
  and , recently , the californian bill aimed to `` protect rape victims '' does nothing of the sort . 
  it treats a conscious person the same as an unconscious person . 
  sex is rape when the woman tells authorities it is rape , even if she never mentions it to the person she 's accusing of rape . 
  if i make a pass at a woman , and for whatever reason she goes along with it , wakes up feeling bad about it , and goes to the police , i go to prison . 
  ahh , jeff . 
  good to see you , by the way . 
  do you still believe that corporations have no interest in gerrymandering the political system ? 
  women get decidedly lower sentences then men for the same crimes . 
  it lost territory against a far superior enemy with outdated and ill maintained equipment . 
  the fact that the soviets were even brought to the negotiating table is a testament to the finn 's resolve and combat finesse . 
   finland did very well in both but , to be honest , there is no indication that moscow wanted a complete finnish capitulation in 1944 . 
  it was their policy toward every belligerent . 
  they only reconsidered for finland because their offensive in 1944 was utterly repulsed by what was , for all intents and purposes , a ragtag gang of misfits .
