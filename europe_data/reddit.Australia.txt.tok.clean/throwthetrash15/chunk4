  they took their chance and self-determination prevailed you do n't know if it would change . 
  and they had no chance at self-determination seeing as the vote was ~ 98 % in favour , something that never happens and is indicative of a faked vote . 
   do n't cry the next time a country you want to have self-determination is refused a vote if you refuse crimeans their right to self-determination . 
  i was n't going to . 
  i 'm fine if crimea wants self-determination but the way the vote was handled was illegal . 
  russia should not have had a military presence , it should have been done a few months or a year later so an actual advertisement of the benefits and cons of each position could be shown and it should have been internationally checked by a third party to make sure everything was above line . 
  the vote they had was a farce that turned them into a russian puppet . 
  enhanced ? 
  do you `` zoom '' the knife into their chest ? 
  england , germany , the us , japan , etc. 
  did n't have the war on their soil , and germany not until 1944 . 
  germany promoted birthing programs for after the war . 
  syria is embroiled in civil war , everywhere you go is dangerous . 
  there is a difference . 
   were the opinions of crimeans asked when crimea was torn away from russia and artificially attached to ukraine ? 
  of course not , but the moment they get a vote to return to russia everyone is up in arms . 
  or do you actually believe that the majority of crimeans still want to be part of ukraine ? 
  the tatar population of crimea abstained from the vote . 
  the vote for separation was hardly legal anyway , they had 7 days and no advertising for the viewpoints of the vote . 
  plus , with armed goons from russia about , it hardly seems like a balanced vote . 
   you also do realize under the ukrainian constitution self-determination is absolutely illegal right ? 
  meaning under no circumstances would crimea ever legally be allowed to have a vote on self-determination and that should change . 
   we 've given quebec two and are willing to give them another if enough of a call for it is there . 
  but hey , keep up your anti-russian circlejerk if you want to continue to pick and choose where self-determination applies . 
  russia would give ukraine the vote for federation if it believed it wanted it and block them if they did n't . 
  they 're opportunists , they do n't care about crimea 's people , only the fact they have non-frozen ports . 
  military presence , or people with guns . 
  also called force of arms . 
  the proper way would be to not have an invasion force standing around with guns . 
  there have been so many peaceful separations you 're forgetting , such as the break up of czechoslovakia . 
  i prefer pay2day, 
  seperation through force of arms , also called annexation . 
  well , if you did n't stop in the past ... 
  got ta get a few jabs in with the mates , do n't ya ? 
  are serbs the borg ? 
  this is n't eu4 , culture conversion takes a long time . 
  dem golden slippers tho he also aped off [ louis xiv , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:louis_xiv_of_france.jpg ) anyway . 
  over my dead family . 
  it 's not a province , it 's a state !!!!!!, 
  bloody yanks . 
  we have rights too !, 
  and they are a fringe group . 
  hard labour ? 
  that 's not a punishment i 've heard of in a long old time ... 
  i 've heard of a guy a while back who took to the extreme , ruined it for everyone . 
  the nukes we used after ww2 were n't just a big bomb - it was a rocket with about 15 small warheads in the top . 
  they 'd be aimed at strategic targets rather than just leveling the city . 
  no , we must have duels to the death in a hung parliament , the winner takes control !!!, 
  i want one from big baby jesus, 
  father christmas and daddy christmas seem endearing and sweet , but turkey 's christmas daddy sounds like a creepy , mustachioed 50 year old santa wearing shorts . 
  strong knowledge in business allows a strong economy , comrade !, 
  infrastructure is *** never *** a problem , comrade . 
  is n't every politician an oligarch , though ? 
  or someone trying to be one ? 
  will finally into space ? 
  will finally into reverse 1939 ? 
  bulgaria was pretty much a ussr puppet . 
  you ca n't just say that . 
  you need to allude to it , not just cut right to the chase in comedy . 
  i ca n't say i want to leave the eu and they have no right to govern me . 
  even if my mind is changed , no one has left . 
  britain is only now having a vote , against the wishes of brussels who want no vote what so ever . 
  that 's how it was advertised in england . 
  so i could be sold on the idea of an economic union , but i 'm not allowed to complain ten years later when a law i never wanted is brought in ? 
  you looked for a countering opinion by posting your 's . 
  if you did n't post anything , nothing would 've come . 
  blame yourself moron . 
   it is also very voluntary . 
   have to follow even if 99.99 % of their electorate is against it . 
  [ quick ! ], 
  ( https://sureshsundarababu.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/queen-reclaim-colonies.jpg?w=540 ), 
   western moral is a false christianism , especially since the 2nd world war . 
  so , rebuilding europe and making a united nations to prevent all wars in the future from happening again is perverted morals ? 
  righto . 
   i understand they did very wrong things in the past and are still doing in the present . 
  but they 're not the only ones , which is what most people seem to think no one thinks that . 
  but you are using the mild , somewhat justified behavior of the us to justify war crimes and the invasion of two nations for land . 
  give me strength !, 
   for me and any christian , every human is the same . 
  that second class must come from the american/english moral you have . 
  from the mouth of someone who called all non-russians barbarians , everyone !, 
   but i can see you 're just a bigot `` and barbarians does n't mean second tier , it just means less civilized . '', 
  your words . 
  not mine . 
   american are the best and only want to be safe and world peace americans want peace because it 's good for business . 
  the reason iraq was invaded so quickly was because they wanted oil to keep flowing . 
  invasion solved the status quo and brought peace . 
  it is n't noble , but it 's better than russia 's `` invade people for land and ports , not to prolong the status quo '' idea . 
   russia only knows how to start wars , without anyone attacking them ahem ...

   pure evil i would n't say that . 
  incompetently evil , maybe . 
   was n't expecting anything else coming from an australian , to be honest . 
  was n't expecting anything else coming from a russian shill , to be honest . 
   you are just america 's bitches , like canada and england and portugal . 
   what the hell , all of that and you just repeated what i said . 
  if by repeated , you mean rebutted , sure .

   the most western they got was east germany for obvious reasons , because they would have been invaded by the west ? 
  i wonder why , you would probably say because of the western conspiracies and barbarians . 
  guess what , it would be because their fucking warmongers !,
