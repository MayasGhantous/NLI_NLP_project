   they are imperial by nature might makes right , huh ? 
   they 're too big and messy not to be so fucking what ? 
  they did n't start big , they began as a fucking town . 
  does n't allow them to kill everyone . 
   so of course they want to keep the `` barbarians '' under their control . 
  barbarians invade before diplomacy . 
  so russia . 
   i 'm not saying we should submit to russia because they do n't want us to , but americans do and it 's not entirely optional . 
  you are saying we should , and you do n't submit to america , you join them willingly . 
   the cultural part is important to understand their point of view . 
  culture has no part . 
  it 's simple imperialism . 
   i really ca n't understand all the hate russia gets when they never did any harm to the west and actually helped us quite a few times this explains everything . 
  just swap your flair to russia , you 're not fooling anyone . 
   it 's not like lithuania and poland never did anything to them . 
  so fucking what , even then they simply took some land . 
  russia took all their land forced them to no longer exist . 
  big difference . 
   and it 's not me who thinks that , it 's the russian . 
  `` poland hurt russia . 
  and it 's not even me who thinks that , it 's russia !, 
  so you know it 's true ! '', 
   and barbarians does n't mean second tier , it just means less civilized . 
  so beneath civilized ? 
  other wise known as ... second class !, 
   they were traumatized by the mongols and since then tried to control everything around them . 
  so they were conquered by an empire that stopped existing almost 500 years ago , thereby justifying the ukrainian war ? 
   but you 're right , the civilized are even worse are you talking to yourself ? 
   the civilized are even worse because they make fun of russia and say they are right and smarter and we should all be in a single western empire no , the west wants peace . 
  the west wants security . 
  the reason the western `` empire '' exists is * because * of russia . 
  nato was made to defend against russia . 
  it is as relevant today as the 1950 's because russia wont stop it 's bullshit . 
   but russia just says no we do n't , we are big and strong so with what right do you tell us what to do ? 
  `` we big . 
  we so strong . 
  you weak . 
  you so easy to kill . 
  i conquer you . 
  but is good because i big , da ? 
   it 's only natural . 
  might makes right , huh ? 
   they do n't want to lose ukraine to the west it is n't their fucking decision to make !, 
  ukraine is independent , they have no fucking right to determine what ukraine has to do !, 
   because that would mean they are out of europe , just another asian country . 
  good , then europe can live in peace without fear of war . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyd9xu92zsg ) is why . 
   much before that the rus was simply a bunch of trading towns in the ukrainian area that were under a lose federation . 
  the mongols came and did away with that . 
  that was n't the russian empire . 
  moscovy was . 
   and you 're basically saying that russia should submit to the us . 
  is that not obvious ? 
  you 're saying we should submit to russia . 
   we are in an american empire an empire that has democracy and is entirely optional to join . 
   playing by american rules the rules are agreed upon by those nations in nato and the pacific . 
   and you 're saying russia , an enemy empire one that is very undemocratic , imperial and actively undermines the international relations of countries and invades them exclusively for land . 
   culturally against western american/british so ? 
  romania is very different to hungary , they do n't go to war . 
   russia was always the most christian country and thinks they are the third rome more shit about this irrelevant subject !, 
  *** the fuck has this got to anything ?!?!?!?!, 
  ***  russia never even wanted to rule the world like american do bullshit , they just ca n't . 
   they just want to rule their part of the world . 
  that 's the only place they can rule seeing as they have weak neighbors . 
   they never wanted more influence in western europe so ukraine and poland in the 20s did n't happen ? 
  poland 1939 did n't happen ? 
  the baltic region 1940 did n't happen ? 
  finland 1940 and 1944 did n't happen ? 
  the balkans 1945 did n't happen ? 
   they never entered any wars against europe before they were attacked [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-polish_war_ ( 1654 % e2 % 80 % 9367 ) ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_northern_war ) [ 3 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-persian_war_ ( 1722 % e2 % 80 % 9323 ) ) , [ 4 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-russian%e2%80%93turkish_war_ ( 1735 % e2 % 80 % 9339 ) ) , [ 5 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-swedish_war_ ( 1741 % e2 % 80 % 9343 ) ) , [ 6 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-turkish_war_ ( 1787 % e2 % 80 % 9392 ) ) , [ 7 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/napoleonic_wars ) , [ 8 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-persian_war_ ( 1826 % e2 % 80 % 9328 ) ) , [ 9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-turkish_war_ ( 1828 % e2 % 80 % 9329 ) ) , [ 10 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_i ) , [ 11 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ukrainian%e2%80%93soviet_war ) , [ 12 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finnish_civil_war ) , [ 13 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sochi_conflict ) , [ 14 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) , [ 15 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_army_invasion_of_georgia ) , [ 16 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invasion_of_poland ) , [ 17 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/soviet_invasion_of_poland ) , [ 18 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/winter_war ) , [ 19 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_front_ ( world_war_ii ) ) , [ 20 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continuation_war ) , [ 21 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ) , [ 22 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) , [ 23 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991%e2%80%9392_south_ossetia_war ) , [ 24 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transnistria_war ) , [ 25 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/war_in_abkhazia_ ( 1992 % e2 % 80 % 9393 ) ) , [ 26 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_chechen_war ) . 
  this was merely a taste of russian offensives against the world from the late 1650s , not just the west , but a large part of it was . 
   only against muslim and without them europe would n't have survived bullshit . 
  the russians fought the ottomans in the caucasus and crimea . 
  west europe was not there . 
  very rarely did russia go against the ottomans when they threatened europe , only when they became weak . 
  and that was n't for defense , it was to take advantage of the weakest power that had good land . 
  europe would have survived because they defeated the ottomans without russia . 
  absolute distortion of history on your part . 
   i for one am grateful for their work against turkey what , there crushing of a sub-par , non-westernized power in asia ? 
   since we ( portugal and spain ) also had to expell muslim from europe and that is actually commendable , because at least then the andalusian 's had some power and required many centuries of crusades to expel . 
  russia had no such trouble , and lost only twice after almost ten wars . 
   and always fought them everywhere you only fought them in spain and the levant , that 's hardly everywhere . 
   and america obviously wants them to rule as little as possible . 
  of course , a world ruled by russia would be a dictatorship run by a tyrannical fool . 
   russia and the west ca n't be friendly because they 're two completely different and enemy empires , each fighting for more power and each thinking they are right . 
  the russians think moscow is the third rome and that western moral is just a false christianism . 
  even when they were communists the turkish probably never believed they were atheists . 
  the americans think democracy and capitalism is the best and want to impose it to everyone , to `` free '' them . 
  they do n't have to be enemies if russia cooperated . 
  i do n't know what you 're getting at with the third rome , we were n't talking about that . 
  russia is capitalist . 
   regarding your previous comment , is n't that what russia always did ? 
  use their power to bully the little guys ? 
  is n't that what america also does , in a way ? 
  probably only the belarusians like them . 
  but did n't the russian empire start in ukraine ? 
  do they not have rightful reasons to think they belong with them , or at least not against them ? 
  i 'm not even talking about the economical benefits , etc. . . just culturally and historically . 
  obviously ukraine does n't want to , but it should still be acting as a tampon , not almost declaring war to russia . 
  russian empire started from the duchy of muscovy , or moscow .
