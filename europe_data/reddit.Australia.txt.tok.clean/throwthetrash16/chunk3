  he said merkel shares ** part ** of the blame . 
   propaganda channel rt , which is most viewed in the uk , i believe you mean russia . 
   and the brexiters were arrogant enough to believe , that they could leave and then call the shots in their new relationship with the eu . 
  show me one person who said we can now boss the eu around please . 
  everyone new the pound would drop ( it has n't `` crashed '' , it 's recovered quite a bit ) and this would actually do good for an island trade nation . 
  shit has n't hit the fan either . 
  you might want to look at why , beyond `` they 're dumb dumbs '' . 
  the same people who support remain are also predominately left , and the left in recent years has taken very anti-white , anti-male stances that this bracket would feel the most seeing as most of disadvantage today comes from money , not skin color or sex . 
  hence , leaving the eu is a vote against that kind of politics . 
  if you look into * why * people vote certain ways rather than yell and shout bigotry as everyone else in this thread is , you 'd understand . 
  do you not get time to do so ? 
  more than half of the 25-34 age bracket did . 
   i am sure some in the eu would love to stick it to the british , but the very next second they 'll remember the clusterfuck that was the breakup of yugoslavia and just keep their traps shut . 
  and yet , the majority of the parliament supports an eu army . 
  united kingdom of disunity ? 
  are you sure ? 
  the ballot was confusing ... 
  victoria ii lied to me ... 
  it was still majority bulgarian before that massacre . 
  we had to find out what the post-soviet states told you . 
   people were as well informed as is feasible . 
  it was n't feasible to simply place advertisements listings the changes ? 
  uh , what ? 
  how is `` nationalism '' being paranoid , and not just being paranoid ? 
  /  centre-left /  coalition with right party perfect sense . 
   which sort of shows the calibre of our voters that we disregard all opinions from a sensible centre right politician sensible enough to outright lie about his largest selling point ? 
  really , you must hold the voters in high contempt to believe this . 
  again , you ca n't back them up . 
  maybe if you 'd try to argue instead of falling asleep during a political debate , you 'd have better chances . 
   `` britain first or put britain first '' what ? 
  i 'm fine with the original , actually . 
  it 's almost a decade , so it was some time ago , but that does n't mean the economy is not slow . 
  `` facts hurt . 
  i ca n't back up my statements . '', 
   it got up from -4.5 to 1.7 after 2009 . 
  and is growing every year . 
  stagnation would mean it is staying at 1.7 since years . 
  which is not the case . 
  you take the number from one year , 1.7 and say it stagnates at 1.7 ? 
  really ? 
  dude !, 
  1.7 is barely impressive . 
  you should aim higher for that * at minimum * . 
   also : not every country has the same type of economy . 
  so some are hit harder than others . 
  have you taken a look at our southern economies ? 
  again , just because you do n't like the facts does n't mean they do n't count . 
  you said it 's not stagnating , which is false , especially seeing as it 's growth is very low , at almost half the lowest average growth of the west . 
  everyone else is recovering too , so that excuse is null and void . 
   this is just wrong . 
  again : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gross_world_product from that very page :  world average - 3.8  advanced economies 2.4  eurozone - 1.7  developing countries - 4.7 you were saying ? 
   and please do n't compare eu to china or india . 
  there is a huge difference in the economy of a developed and a undeveloped country . 
  `` please do n't use this evidence , it invalidates my claims ! '', 
   seems like there is a little hole in your memory . 
  growth is not stagnating . 
  in fact its recovering from the crash 2008 and is constantly increasing . 
  i 'm sure in 2-3 years its back at its old value because it is nothing but going up since years . 
  slowly but steady . 
  everywhere else is growing at much higher rates , except many african nations for obvious reasons . 
   before that crash the eu was on par with all advanced economies world wide . 
  so if you want someone to blame for this better look at the uk and the us banks and not the eu , because they are the one to blame for the crash . 
  everyone except the eu is to blame also ,  so if you want someone to blame for this better look at the uk and the us banks and not the eu , ** because they are the one ** to blame for the crash . 
   but he is right . 
  either you are throwing around with meaningless facts like `` eu is stagnating '' . 
  ( stagnating in what ? ), 
  growth . 
  if he was right he would n't leave at the first sign of trouble . 
   or you ignore reality . 
  many small independent countries always lead to more tension in the past . 
  just look at the uk . 
  would you say the missing border between ireland and northern ireland has improved the situation or not ? 
  that 's entirely ethnic tension , and would remain regardless of the eu or irish occupation due to the fact there is a large british and anglican population there . 
   that 's why the european union should have its own military without us meddling ... to gain experience . 
  and what would it do ? 
  why ca n't the states have their own ? 
  yugoslavia worked out real well , did n't it ? 
  that should be a case study of why not to have a federalized european army . 
   you want to win all arguments by flip flopping every time you lose . 
  [ citation needed ]  what is it then , only the us can operate a military and make mistakes ? 
  point out where i said this . 
   well , the eu is the first union in european history that has been succesful in preventing any escalations of conflicts of interests . 
  why break it ? 
  no , that 's called nato . 
  i 've given facts and arguments . 
  you are leaving because you ca n't counter them . 
  good luck in your ideological hugbox . 
   i suppose you read up a on the decades before ww1 , especially the 'cause and rise ' section . 
  there were more causes than a trade deal , and you stated a trade deal directly caused it . 
   that 's because both the special historical conditions that involve these countries , you ca n't just compare a newly ` independent ' uk to present day suisse , aswel as the very specific agreements they do have with the eu , but which we simply do not know . 
  you 're seriously stating that if the uk leaves , they or the eu will invade each other ? 
  for what purpose ? 
   if you think that 1 ethnic tensions were one of the primary causes that really formed the core of the problems leading to the different ww 's , then i 'm afraid i have nothing to say to you . 
  you are retarded . 
  border disputes and tension between poles , germans , czechs and slavs played a part . 
   are you saying that international trade was better before the eu ? 
  because that 's what you 're saying . 
  yes . 
  the eu is stagnating whilst the world is expanding . 
   i do n't even know how to start explaining to you how quickly those things can change .
