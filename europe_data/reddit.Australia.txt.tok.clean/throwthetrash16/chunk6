  we live in a society literally based around spending - it 's the whole point of consumerism . 
  people ** will not ** want to live `` basically '' , everyone wants something . 
  people still go out in droves to buy games , consoles , phones , perfumes , clothes , decorations , etc , and giving them more money only increases their ability to do so . 
  you claim i , as in internet-having person , am naive , yet it only takes you three seconds to google consumerism . 
  it should be blatantly obvious to anyone but the poorest person that they are continuously purchasing luxury goods , as is everyone else who is n't that poor . 
  buying is the name of the game in our western , capitalistic society , and the amount of technology-based goods abound here are never enough for anyone . 
   a lot more `` spending money '' will cause inflation and nullify the basic income . 
  they 're not printing money . 
  inflation does n't increase when your purchasing more things . 
  it would increase if no one spent it on anything . 
   the average rent in san francisco for 1 bedroom is $ 3,000 . 
  the average rent in kansas city is $ 700 . 
  now how would you structure bi to accommodate both cities ? 
  bi would give the people there much higher abilities to pay rent . 
  however , i 'm of the understanding that sa is very much an affluent city , so it 's not the amount of money but space and population that is causing inflation . 
   it will cause a significant decrease in the motivation to work among citizens , with unforeseen consequences for the national economy it would actually increase motivation , and boost the economy . 
  all of a sudden the majority of the population are no longer as concerned with rent or food as they once were ; they now have a lot more spending money , and that is only good for companies and economic growth . 
   it requires a complete restructuring of the taxation , social insurance and pension systems , which will cost a significant amount of money the current system of social help in germany is more effective because it 's more personalized : the amount of help provided is not fixed and depends on the financial situation of the person ; for some socially vulnerable groups the basic income could be not sufficient i do n't understand why this is being done like this . 
  you do n't need to restructure anything - all this requires is a ** fixed ** income , then you can keep all other services the same and simply adjust databases for those who need more ( sick , elderly , poor , etc ) . 
   it will cause a vast increase in immigration as if anything is going to change this . 
  germany has two options here : more stringent checks on immigrants and refugees ( which it needs * regardless ** of this being instituted ) or just to continue on . 
  i vote the former . 
   it will cause a rise of the shadow economy not really . 
  those with jobs will continue to work for more money , and those already working under the table are more likely to stop . 
  those working legitimately have little reason to stop , and those not working legitimately now have a relatively equal source of income without the negatives ( arrest , employer abuse , etc ) . 
   the corresponding rise of taxes will cause more inequality : higher taxes will translate themselves into higher prices of everyday products , harming the finances of poor people there is no realistic way to finance basic income this is only true if you continue to neglect the upper class and corporation taxes in favor of goods and services tax . 
  the increase in spending money for all classes translates into an increase in corporate income which translates into an increase in taxable corporate income . 
  2016 worst year of my life . 
  chocolate ? 
  c'mon dude , everyone knows you use the cream pie , less money . 
  rich people do n't need to work . 
  many rich people are not pensioners . 
  only 20 % of the british in spain are 65 + . 
  where did anyone mention pensioners ? 
   nowhere did you differentiate between state collectivism and social collectivism , ** and the former is implied seeing as the data linked above was on national policy . 
   were naturally inclined towards collectivism . 
  as i said , state policy is different, 
   ultra-turbo-nazis `` hitler bots - transform ! '', 
  / u/europauniverstellaris is leaking ? 
  throughout history , unless your living in a hippy commune , collectivism has been a thoroughly oppressive thing . 
  nowhere did you differentiate between state collectivism and social collectivism , and the former is implied seeing as the data linked above was on national policy . 
  that 's generally a forced form of generosity . 
  `` 50 bottles of vodka , please . '', 
  `` money ran out early this week , huh ? '', 
  * looks away shamefully *, 
  `` generosity '' : 1 . 
  myanmar wow . 
  i still fail to see how civil disputes in ukraine led to a massive western media campaign and pro-ukraine zeitgeist in 2014 . 
  i 'm asking why we should self censor . 
  i 'm not encouraging anybody to do anything ... you on the other hand where did i say self censor ? 
  i did n't come here to censor you , i came here to address the fact that you and others are jumping to conclusions and making baseless claims . 
   are telling us what to do i 'm not stopping you . 
  but what you are taking as censorship is just criticism . 
  grow up . 
  make assumptions if you want , just do n't expect to get away with it . 
  how is stating * fact * jumping to conclusions ? 
  we * know * russia invaded crimea , we * know * they are either participating or funding the rebels in the donbass . 
  also , you kindly got rid of any context there , as i did say that the zeitgeist i was talking about was the one that started with ukraine . 
  civil disputes and russian antagonism are not the same as russian led annexation and invasion of ukraine . 
  got you confused with shevagleb . 
  i apologize . 
  the ukrainian civil war zeitgeist started more than a decade before ? 
  no , but you support that position . 
  examples : `` why ca n't we make assumptions ? 
  this is reddit ... a forum filled with questions , discussions , assumptions , accusations etc etc why should we make an exception here ? '', 
  `` why should be self-censor and show restraint in this instance ? '', 
  ( in the context of the above ) `` also why should kyiv be immune from assumptions and speculation ? '', 
   except it was n't ( i know this may not be your opinion ) . 
  the * zeitgeist * was started by russia . 
  no , but that does n't mean we jump to conclusions . 
  because ( as i 've stated twice now ) two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  sure , but i do n't blame them . 
  i used to be very pro-ukraine . 
  the zeitgeist of pro-ukraine is easily explained : they were invaded in crimea and russia either invaded or funded a rebellion in the donbass . 
  this was * started * by russia , and as events continue , people lose interest , and thus do n't catch up with as much information , hence no knowledge of ukrainian errors . 
  that 's kind of wrong , seeing as there have been numerous reports with conclusions such as the one stating the mh17 crash was caused by russian state equipment . 
   not sure , how to feel about it . 
  the best choice * right now * is nothing . 
  there is not enough information to make a proper observation or conclusion . 
   i just dislike the double standard that so many people seem to apply to ukraine/russia . 
  i do n't think there is a double standard , as this thread shows , because there is bias and assumptions and baseless claims on both sides . 
  hell , i 'm the only one defending the rational point of view here against three people , does that not show that both sides have bias ? 
  either way , two wrongs do n't make right . 
  that source gives no information other than the fact that they were n't allowed into the area . 
  as i said , this a pre-mature discussion . 
   why ca n't we make assumptions ? 
  this is reddit ... a forum filled with questions , discussions , assumptions , accusations etc etc why should we make an exception here ? 
  because it adds nothing tot he discussion and only derails it . 
  it 's like saying `` why not just arrest that man for the murder . 
  he walked past here . '', 
  there could be numerous reasons for the fact he walked past , and assumptions and jumping to conclusions does nothing but obfuscate the discussion . 
   this is n't some random entity that could be an `` ngo '' funded by moscow . 
  this is a branch of the un . 
  when eu observers are blocked from entering parts of the donbas , when there was limited access to the malaysian plane crash there was outrage and tons of assumptions and that was ok ... why should be self-censor and show restraint in this instance ? 
  because two wrongs do n't make a right . 
  just because one situation had assumptions means does n't mean this one should . 
  you 're literally arguing that making baseless claims should be encouraged . 
  yes and i hope they answered , but as i said , jumping to conclusions as has happened here ( with / u/shevagleb apparently being of the mind that this is cut and dry cover up by ukraine ) when there are numerous things that cut be the reason . 
  with no information other than the team not being authorized to enter , we can not make assumptions . 
  speculation is fine , but assumptions are altogether different .
