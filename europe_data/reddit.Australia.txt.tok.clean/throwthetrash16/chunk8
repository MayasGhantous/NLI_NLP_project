  this all besides the pint , however . 
  my tag may show me as an australian , but it lacks all context . 
  my father is english , my mother is the descendant of an englishman and a woman from new zealand . 
  so i am a british citizen . 
  i intend to travel and settle there for the rest of my life when i finish studies . 
  i fail to see how i am unable or not allowed to discuss the events in this thread , and even if i was not a citizen , then i would still respect someone 's right to do so . 
  what right does a ( possible ) latvian have to discuss the * british * eu `` leave or remain '' vote going by your logic ? 
  and yes , i saw that accidentally wrote point as pint , but it will stay for obvious reasons . 
  you are literally saying that italy has no natural resources and is hostile to human development . 
  that is retarded . 
  and how does german law on banning free expression relate to the eu as a whole , or juncker wanting to limit right parties ? 
  i also saw no car accidents today , does that mean it 's non-existent ? 
  just because there is also an opposing view does not make the bias present in media false , even the graphic shows that with the `` remain '' bias category . 
  is `` rok182 '' the latvian version of blink182 ? 
  murdoch wants to stay , i believe . 
   or 45 % of media is non-biased no , that is what `` no disposition '' and `` mixed , undecided '' are for . 
  saying that those with a bias for `` leave '' are stating facts implicitly says that those with a bias for `` remain '' are necessarily stating lies , which is patently false . 
  also  just reporting facts . 
  as i said in the comment you apparently did n't read , bias = / = lies . 
   that 's a stupid way to go about it . 
  saying that bias is not inherently lying and that 45 % of media is biased in the `` remain '' side is a `` stupid way to go about it '' ? 
  about what , exactly ? 
  stating the true definitions of words and explicit , statistical fact ? 
  just as a matter of disclosure , i am pro-leave . 
   i am sick of this discussion then do n't click these links and do n't comment maybe ? 
  no one is forcing you to read or join in the discussion . 
  you can leave at anytime . 
  bias does n't mean lying , merely that you 're biased . 
  so in this case , 45 % of media is pro-remain . 
   i do n't know . 
  does there have to be one ? 
  from your deleted commented minutes ago in which you asked * me * to give you * your * point , this is pretty weird . 
  but yes , you would not have made a political statement without having a political point . 
  stop being disingenuous and semantic . 
   i thought you were making some point and i thought i was replying . 
  it 's all in our heads . 
  from the looks of your deleted comment , you actually thought i was making your points . 
   accomplishments . 
  creating capital and a big army is pretty easy when you have a shitton of natural resources and land in a climate that is very suitable for human development . 
  try doing the same thing without resources . 
  ironic that you have forgotten the roman empire , when it 's literally alluded to in your handle . 
   a tiny border point in the north with norway and via alaska . 
  nothing that would bother any military minded person - actually , it would . 
  nato doctrine in the cold war , and most likely now , is to ensure that russia is unable to leave the barents sea , or else be severely hampered by the exit . 
  in being able to exit the barents , russia can enable it 's nuclear submarines to strike the east coast , canada and europe at once . 
   the eastern european corridor is the worrying part . 
  not really . 
  russia 's army is the only one in europe capable of sustained , large scale military operations . 
  western europe 's militaries are increasingly under-budget , under-funded and ill-maintained . 
  they can not mount any serious military defense or expedition in the eastern area . 
   if you truly believe that a country should not feel threatened by continous expansionism of their international rivals , both in an economical , military and local influence sense , then you truly have no idea what you are talking about . 
  `` expansionism '' . 
  you say this with a straight face without even wondering * why * most of eastern europe quickly joined nato as soon as they were free from the ussr 's grip . 
  what you are basically saying is that a common alliance created as security and to defend against * russian * expansionism and imperialism is what caused it . 
  ** you ** clearly have no idea of what you are talking about , especially seeing as you lack any historical knowledge beyond 2007 .

  a vassal does n't necessarily have to be a tributary state . 
  i was saying more of in the sense that russia considered ukraine to be in its sphere of influence , which it was . 
  that 's a pretty malleable definition of vassal . 
  it 's like saying switzerland is an eu vassal because they share many policies with the eu countries . 
  i did too . 
  what 's your point ? 
   hostile to the constitution i am against the limiting of free speech and the banning of symbols the government dislikes . 
  am i now worthy of being suppressed and arrested ? 
  literally everyone is in someway hostile to the constitution of every government , everywhere . 
   we are now coming in to a time where almost every european doesnt know what war is . 
  leaving the eu wont lead to war , especially when more than half are already in nato , and europeans are incredibly weary of war . 
  this ... what your arguing for is basically like vichy france . 
  rather than continue on as the free french to freedom , you want to stay an eu ( nazi ) controlled puppet where juncker can impose his will in order to ... not let him impose his will ? 
  that 's some great cognitive dissonance . 
  i want what you 're having . 
   at least we do n't generalise `` an ** irish ** generalising on ethnic basis . 
  ** typical . 
  saves on paper . 
   if people are ignorant enough to believe most of that garbage will the brussels massacre reverse itself if i try to believe hard enough ? 
  that does n't give the page any justice !, 
   essentially , we 'd be dead if we had to go up against anything other than minor sub-saharan african countries . 
  and only in a conventional war , which it would not be . 
  there is no corpse located 23 ' 30 `` n 40 ' 23 `` e !, 
  i do n't know where you got such an idea !, 
   it was your argument . 
  it was ? 
   and it was stupid . 
  `` hurr hurr you are a dumb dumb ! '', 
   whatever im out convenient . 
   we may as well label everything anyone else disagrees with as satire .
