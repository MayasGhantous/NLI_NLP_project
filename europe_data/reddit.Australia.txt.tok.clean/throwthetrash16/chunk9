  hence why the artist gets to choose what it is , seeing as it 's * their * work . 
  a film critic does n't choose that alien is an action movie , nor the terminator an arthouse sex film . 
  you 're destroying your own arguments . 
  the entire point was to show how stupid these free speech laws are . 
  you have comically missed the point . 
  whoever made it determines it purpose , seeing as they are the creator . 
  if anyone else did , we may as well label everything we disagree with a pure slam piece in order to silence critics . 
   i was talking about general principles that also happen to apply in germany . 
  as i said , we are talking about germany , not denmark . 
  the laws are * very * different , with `` hate speech '' being much looser term , allowing critics of islam to be tried . 
   the strawman consists of tring to speak on behalf of me in the last comment , even though i said no such thing . 
  there was no strawman . 
  you brought up * denmark , * without saying so , and i continued on about * germany . 
  * it is not a strawman to then take that argument * in the context of germany * and say how it wrong . 
  this is not a strawman , it 's simple miscommunication on your part . 
  and we only recently had a terrorist attack on one too . 
  and we have to ask `` why ? '', 
  was the cockpit breached it an attack ? 
   hey everyone , let 's jump to conclusions !, 
  very convenient that you left everything else out of that comment showing he did not jump to conclusions . 
  in aviation , it 's very uncommon for a plane to disintegrate from things besides explosions or structural failure , and as the latter can be safely ignored due it 's rarity , it leaves only one conclusion . 
  the koran also encourages the murder of unbelievers , apostates , the conquering of foreigners , etc. 
  it 's incredibly contradictory . 
   really ? 
  because it 's a constitutional right here in denmark . 
  you ca n't just void it at will . 
  except for the fact that people have been tried for criticizing islam . 
  i said no such thing . 
  i know little about the specific case , am not german , do n't know your laws , etc. 
  i am not german , but this whole conversation has been about german law , specifically a case * in germany * this thread is about . 
  so , no , it 's not a strawman , it 's you not knowing what we 're talking about . 
  if you 'd brought up denmark before , it 'd be different . 
  the first couple crusades had the byzantines and catholics work together to take jerusalem and hold it . 
   the us 's interventionist policy dragged its nato partners ( europeans ) into wars like the iraq and lybia which destabilized the region , they were already in wars by the time we got there . 
  lybia ahs been free of western influence since independence , mostly . 
   is it a constitutional right ? 
  that should make it significantly harder . 
  it 's not a right , period . 
  it 's a privilege in germany . 
   this is clearly false because < non-reasons  just because you think a man should be punished for satire does n't make it a non-reason . 
   they change all the time , so if you do n't like what free `` speech '' looks like in germany , then push your representatives to change it . 
  as i 've stated before , it 's a little hard to speak your mind knowing what you say is n't protected from people in authority , ie : the people you want to change . 
  and ? 
  you 're point is what ? 
  also , kangaroo fucker is very silly , there is no such stereotype here . 
  you 're looking for sheep and new zealand , you fucking nazi . 
  and how affected by the migrant crisis are they ? 
  are their politicians actively working against a large portion of the nations interest and calling them racist/xenophobic/islamophobic for it ? 
  it 's satirical , as stated for the * second time . 
   do you really think people would suddenly become peaceful and start to coexist in harmony just because you removed religion from the equation ? 
  they 'd be fighting just as much a before , just over slightly different things . 
  point out where i said this , please . 
  if you could read , you would note i said  no * religious * violence . 
  which right wing governments ? 
  i do n't recall hungary starting the syrian war . 
  all these wars `` caused '' by europe are all civil wars , caused by ethnic/religious differences and political disagreements . 
   saterical speech is just speech , it has no special value , or else i could call in a joking way to call for the extermination of all jews and muslims , create a good laughter thereby . 
  yes , that it is satire has to be added to the context , but that allone is not a reason that it has not the same limitations as freedom of speech . 
  then what you are saying has no value and you should be arrested . 
  see why we have fos , now ? 
   also , the government has more than just the obligation to give freedom . 
  germany has also the duty to protect the constitutional rights of its citicens , for example the human dignity of each man , just as they are obliged to protect the life of every human so your right to offense trumps your right to speech ? 
  stop offending me , off to jail !, 
   the idea that freedom of speech can everything lead us in the past into hitler-germany and we learned that a freedom can only go as far as it does not violate the freedom of other people , for example their human dignity that can be violted by free speech . 
  there are no ulitmative freedoms because every ultimative freedom of a single person can become supression for others when this single person is able to missuse the freedom completly . 
  we have laws that dictate that you can not incite to violence . 
  `` dignity '' should never be a right on the same level as speech . 
   freedom is the ability to use your rights as long as you do n't unjustly hurt others . 
  stop offending me . 
  see how this does n't work now ? 
   you can hurt other 's , everyone has to endure certain amounts of suffering for the freedoms of other 's , but everything has its limits , and blunt and intentional lies are nothing that has to be endured , so it 's okay to curtail freedom of speech , but not dignity ? 
  you 're a coward . 
   or we end with a second trump , oh , sorry , i meant hitler trump has killed 12 million people and started the worst war in history , has he ? 
   because satire falls under the same rules . 
  you can do satire as much as you want as long as it falls under the limitations of free speech which i just showed . 
  no , you talked about freedom of the * press , * also known as ** blatant lies . 
  **  his words are ( at least for a big part of the poem ) basic slander . 
  it 's satirical . 
  the fact that 's it 's illegal is an attack on free speech . 
   that 's not really the fault of the religion itself , though . 
  without the religion and it 's various contradictions , there would be no disagreements , and therefore no religious violence . 
   normally , it is swapped , normally , the right not to be insulted is seen on a lower rank as the freedom of speech , but only as long as the free speech does not get missuesed by saying blunt lies . 
  then it 's not freedom of speech . 
  fos allows you to lie , as long as it is not libel or slander . 
   as long as the free speech is factual-based and not just to smere someone else , you can say what you want . 
  ** blatant lies . 
  ** this very thread is about a man who was ruled against for making a ** satirical ** poem in which he insulted a man . 
  freedom of speech trumps your right to be offended , every time , else it is not freedom of speech . 
   the rule we learn in university ( i study law ) is that whenever there is unclear if this is just smearing slander or factual based , it is factual based and allowed to say . 
  only when a text has no more content as a tirade of insults , solely aimed to diminsh another person without discussing anything about that person , free speech is limted and losses . 
  again , it not freedom of speech then . 
  and , as stated above , this was a ruling against satirical works , so again , ** blatant lies . 
   germany is one of very very few nations in the world that got a perfect grade in concernse of freedom of press . 
  you can say nearly everything in germany , there are just two expetions : * freedom of the press * means jack shit when we are talking about * freedom of speech . 
  *  and which you only want to hurt another person , you are free to say everything ** blatant lies , ** as i 've already stated , seeing as a man has had his freedom of speech violated in a ** satirical ** poem , the fact which this thread is discussing . 
  what you are doing is walking up to a murder scene and saying it was suicide . 
  and united countless times too to prevent islamic expansion . 
   neither will happen . 
  obviously , you have n't being paying attention . 
  people are going in droves to the right now , due to the fact that most liberals have become disillusioned with the regressive left and either have no where to go , or wish to simply throw a wrench in the works to get the left to wake up .
