what 's up with slovenia ? 
  being so far `` behind '' compared to croatia is something i did n't expect . 
  but it was the summer when i bought my first real 6-string . 
  95 was my first summer if memory serves me right !, 
  there is simply too many poor people in this world , even if some regions are not at war they are major shitholes . 
  it 's impossible to help everyone , that 's something people need to realize and as you said , risking our own stability is just ridiculous . 
  i do n't know , watch and tell me , 
  maybe you should watch `` we feed the world '' , its an austrian documentation , which also interviews the nestle ceo back then . 
  no need to buy when you 're the best choice ( :, 
  the grand emperor vittore i gozzadini , chosen buy god and the electors of the holy roman empire . 
  he put the roman back into the holy roman empire . 
  venice joined the holy roman empire when the title was bestowed upon emperor vittore i. 
  the hungarians got finally defeated and will never be again . 
  the venetian lines will be widened by new recruits from all over the empire . 
  they will be ready to defend the empire from it 's enemies . 
  ave , imperator , morituri te salutant, 
  the treaty of versailles made them solely responsible for the war . 
  worst way to die , i was trapped in ostmark , only way out to engage the 20k rebelstack again ... all those venecian dieing in vain . 
   also / u/magnive you missed out some good shit the first time the game goes down rather fluent , there is no streamer . 
  the game is from 1444 until 1820 , we 're at 1500 , so no deutschland yet . 
  the venecian doge had this stroke 45 years ago in a crucial war . 
  i do n't think so . 
  venice participated in the containment war against france . 
  after that with the help of the 3 other italian kingdoms , venice was able to acquire valuable hungarian land so the italians will never have to fear for lebensraum . 
  then the ragusian duchy swore their allegiance after a swift occupation of their territory . 
  after this and finally paying back all loans , the republic of venice was able to take a step in the right direction . 
  a last vote was held and the republic dismantled . 
  a dictatorship was called to further lead the venecian and italian people to glory . 
  italy will not fall . 
  italy will not bow . 
  italy will stay free . 
  man the latvians really like austria considering all those austrian flags there : ^ ), 
  someone in the turkish goverment : `` maybe . . we are the baddies ? '', 
  probably after reparations for conquering italian lands . 
  the doge of venice , finally has something good to report . 
  after the austrian king fled the field and italian and livonian reinforcements arrived austria was struck down and it 's days were counted . 
  northern italy has been secured . 
  the rouge nation of mantua will also be brought back home within the next 2 years . 
  venice has almost fully recovered from the 2 wars against austro-ottoman and it 's finance as well as it 's research institutions have recovered and are working at 100 % . 
  corruption is being routed out from the new italian provinces . 
  the venecian goverment as well as the current elected doge , will protect italy from harfmul outsiders as well as insiders . 
  the true path is to elect people and not to think god choses the leaders . 
  n.r.m p.s : sometimes it 's not about the power you have , but the people you can unite for your cause . 
  welcome to the club . 
  what are the consequences of poland not signing ? 
   because we have more dialects : ppp https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder981/250x250/73134981.jpg, 
  checkmate atheists, 
  it was just a joke , because reddit told me belgium is n't real : ^ ), 
  then belgium should n't be on the list : ^ ), 
  austria is in 4 !, 
  austria first , belgium second . 
  i like that the countries are ordered by importance ( top important , bottom unimportant ) ^ ^ ^ ^ \\ ( and ^ ^ ^ ^ definitly ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ ^ alphabet ), 
   yeah , reality is n't a disney land it 's not even the parking lot in front of disney land . 
  ohh but evil austria for closing the balkan routes with other countries : ^ ), 
  what are you talking about ? 
  can also confirm . 
  was on google maps in lissabon , felt very safe . 
   as a person from a country where there 's mandatory conscription of males , i think women should have mandatory conscription as well . 
  it 's the same here in austria and i agree . 
  looks more like a complex fracture of a foot : ^ ), 
  sources please . 
  [ will always be relevant ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ german ^ ^ but ^ ^ subtitles ^ ^ work ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2e2yhjc_mc ), 
  i think there is still to point out if friends just take super powers and make unconditional alliances that the game indeed becomes rather unplayable for some countries . 
  even more when for balancing reasons countries get banned and rules get set , but then you 'd have lets say france , austria , spain unconditional aliance at day1 , it would certainly lead to some stupid imbalance . 
  austria-ottoman was a day 1 alliance . 
  + the argument with austria is not a great power , but still is in a very special place as emperor with one of the highest if not the highest forcelimit at the start . 
  first of all , nice that it worked . 
  now to crucial parts that were imo not ok . 1 ) game balance between superpowers there are banned countries and rules in place to balance the powers . 
  yet 2 + friends decide to ally each other and just play together even if they never would if it were different players throws the balance of even more than if plc goes down . 
  szenario : i bring 5 friends and we 're fast for the next campaign and just take france , england , ottoman , austria and play co-op . 
  this would n't be much fun to play . 
  2 ) playing overtime we should never play overtime . 
  no matter the technical difficulties or whatsoever . 
  it is especially bad if then a certain amount of people dc in one region and then still keep playing longer . 
  ( middle-eastern europe : hungary , venice , plc , . . africa : tunis ) and then if those dc 's get abused it 's even worse . 
  3 ) savegames like it was done later , the save should be available through a fileshare-service before hosting the lobby again . 
  give everyone 5 minutes time and count it as a break . 
  those are my 3 cents . 
  there will be a 90 % chance of serious backstabbing . 
  speed 2 will make it that troop movements will take already 5 + minutes . 
  ( depending form where they go ), 
   rightful land in italy \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  i do n't think the player can sort out and ally against the ottomans , there will be backstabbing and in the end ottomans will win . 
  i 'm more curious about how the hungarians , poles , uzbeks , timurids , mamaluks , etc. 
  will handle the situation when the small ones got annexed . 
  i 'm curious if the ottomans will just pick them apart one by one through sneaky diplomacy or rather bruteforce their way through . 
  i 'm not sure if i like the rule or if i do n't like the rule , it has both ups and downs . 
  that 's what i was thinking too , hm . 
  is the ledger deactivated ? 
  i hope so !, 
  as spectator or a nation ? 
  ( is it paradox ? ), 
  where are the kings and doges of the italian region ? 
  i 'm venice !, 
  [ yes we have them in austria ^ ^ totally ^ ^ not ^ ^ zoo ] ( https://www.zoovienna.at/tiere/saeugetiere/sibirischer-tiger/ ), 
  it 's not for everyday use , it 's for collecting or as investment . 
  you misspelled laibach : ^ ), 
   we done 80 + people fine . 
  us at r/sweddituniversalis have reached that number , though expect a huge amount of people dropping out in the beginning as they get bored/tardy/wiped out . 
  i do n't expect even close to everyone to show up , mostly the opms i do n't think that all will even show up .
