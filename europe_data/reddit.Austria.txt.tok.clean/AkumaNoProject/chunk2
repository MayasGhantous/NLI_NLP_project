   honestly the biggest issue is actually the few client players with awful internet connections that makes the speed drop down to 1 . 
  and that due to bugs someone will always desync/crash but you ca n't rehost every 5th minute . 
  yes that 's the issue i 'm more concerned about, 
  the most i 've played was with 9 :d i 'm worrying about the host-pc will not be strong enough , same for his internet connection . 
  sorry : c fixed it now . 
  ( i 'm not sure if it 's entirely correct , if people change countries and it only gets edited in the list i do n't check again since it would be too much , i only keep adding new ones , but it should be at least a good indicator ), 
  austria has some tough work before it !, 
  phew, 
  was n't it just about the wording where `` slovenischsprachige staatsb\u00fcrger '' got taken out , and replaced by `` staatsb\u00fcrger '' ? 
  how exactly ? 
  it 's 89 people right now , i 'm not sure if the game can handle that : o, 
  yes that 's what i meant , that it 's the same country but differently spelled . 
  i try to update as often as possible , until the ulm one it should be up to date . 
  jianzhou and yianzhou are the same country ? 
  they 're twice in the list !, 
  ( / u/lolidkwtfrofl and / u/silaz ), 
  damn grey colors , my bad , fixed now, 
  i gib 100 ducats you kill austria ? 
  big trubble in small italy ? 
  yes , castille might have trouble finishing the reconquista . 
   and italy is going to be a wonderfully bloody mess . 
  and we 're right in it , though you should hope aragon does n't go insta pu to castille :d, 
   edit : also i think you gave england a few extra provinces in france :p no , i just looked again and it should be just 6 provinces for england, 
  i made this [ visualisation of the list ( careful big ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sbkgzpq.jpg ) . 
  ( updated 22.2 19:00 ) ~ ~ also : hosokawa are twice on the list ! ~ ~ ~ ~ / u/pashahlis and / u/thechosenapiks ~ ~ edit : also will there be at the start of the first time after everyone is ingame 10-20 minutes on pause to sort out diplomacy ? 
  also multiplayer is a lot more about diplomacy ( and fun ! ), 
  could i play venice ? 
  wow i did n't know what i expected when i scrolled down, 
  who are they making out to be in this `` inner circle '' ? 
  soooo yay ? 
  or nay ? 
  * better version imo, 
  why not from stermann and grissemann ? 
  you could get rich if you would invent such a thing, 
  or a meteorite . 
  meteorite efficency vs. dinosaurs : 100 %, 
  i 'd like trump more if he was a dinosaur,

  i do n't think aslong as he is an official diplomat/representative he should actually be forced to leave . 
  but i 'm not 100 % sure about it . 
   i recall a certain german chancellor becoming a russian cheerleader for putin at the expense of us & eastern europe aha  and then taking a stand against us on iraq . 
  oh yes , let 's support the us 's warmongering ... let 's cheer for it !, 
  yeah !, 
   spied on us continously & took a stand against us on iraq . 
  lucky that the us does n't spy on allies or something . . / s  but after a half-a-century of commitment to europe , the europeans seem to jump at the first opportunity to stab us in the back , cut as many ties as possible & re-align away from us completly yes there was no gain from the us evolvement all over the world . 
  that was a pure act of grace . 
   `` anyone that does n't agree with the eu politically is not allowed to enter europe ! '', 
  i see , comprehensive reading is n't one of your strenghts . 
  a ) it 's not about agreeing , it 's about threatening to `` destroy the eu '' as an official diplomat . 
  b ) ** persona non grata ** in ** eu-memberstates ** . 
  this is why you do n't make a deal with the `` devil '' ( or someone really unrelieable ) and instead implement your own solution . . eu get your shit together this is your time to shine . . 
  the way he is talkig publicly ( that 's important that he is making these threats in the public ) he should be persona non grata in the eu-memberstates . 
  rather regarding to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stasi, 
  i did n't notice at first , `` english stasi '' seems really unfortunate :d,

  does n't germany also vote for parties and not directly the person ? 
  [ dualism intensifies ] ( http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/osterreich-ungarn/images/1/17/%c3%96u_flagge.png/revision/latest?cb=20151206004135&amp;path-prefix=de ), 
  i know where it would be , but it would be nice to have at least all the major cities on the map ... for the visuals !, 
  oh ... no vienna ... okay :(, 
  even in the current eu , this bloc would have significant influence, 
   well , the a-u was quite bad for croatia , as croatia was the only other active political entity within the empire , and thus a major inconvenience . 
  croatia was split and messed with right up until the war . 
  which was the try to disvolve the tensions which were rising ( in my opinion ) , not really the right approach , since it would n't have worked and other solutions were being brought up to solve the problem . . like trialism , federalism . .  the only chance for a proper deal was trialism , but that idea died with ferdinand in sarajevo unfortunately . 
  i do n't think that the trialism would have solved the tensions of the `` vielv\u00f6lkerstaat '' ( sorry i ca n't think of a good word , basically country many enthnicies had to live together ) . 
  sooner or later a i think a form of federalism ( which was also proposed ) would have been more likely , like the `` ungarischer ausgleich '' , `` m\u00e4hrischer ausgleich '' followed up by maybe the `` slowenischer ausgleich '' , `` kroatischer ausgleich '' ... so somewhat like the eu ^ ^ but ^ ^ cooler ^ ^ and ^ ^ smaller in general ( more specifically for the general population ) i would say it could have been better , but it could have been much worse . 
  edit : but maybe i 'm wrong and biased idk, 
  what would be the critical parts ? 
  that 's why i put member in '' '' i meant regarding to slovenia , croatia , bosnia , czechia and slovakia ( + other territories ) or do i have a wrong assesment ? 
  austro-hungary was n't that bad for the `` member '' - states as some would imagine . 
  it 's something !? 
  let 's see how it will play out i guess . 
  the points listed are interesting , it 's the right direction , reducing the numer of crossings and increased funding to decrease the general migration . 
  how about no ? 
  the eu can only destroy it self , britain is not that important . 
  it 's the same for andy murray , if he wins he 's british , if he loses he 's scottish . 
  they are reporting that he 's from albania, 
  so , how about we try to stop it instead of threatening to join the race to the bottom ? 
  what could go wrong in a race to the bottom ? 
  are the lr-epp and the em-ni close to eachother , that the predicitons give them in the 2nd close to all votes from eachother ? 
  so when will the first round be ? 
  and the second one will be a `` stichwahl '' ( best 2 from first round against each other ) ? 
  and it 's too long for some crunchy news headlines, 
  how many threedeckers are ready ? 
  will the grand armada be ready to sail by sunrise ? 
   ende that 's smart . 
  yes but it 's uncreative :(, 
  so , the british raj will be reastablished ? 
  it looks like it 's in jump range no ? 
  who ? 
  i 'm planning to go there after finals in two weeks ( :, 
  `` we are not now that strength which in old days moved earth and heaven , that which we are , we are . 
  one equal temper of heroic hearts , made weak by time and fate , but strong in will . 
  to strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield . '', 
  this kinda fits the situation europe finds itself in ps : `` bella gerant alii , tu felix austria nube . '', 
  i do n't understand this sentiment of people who want to `` save '' all the poor refugees . 
  why destabilize the eu for this ? 
  if there 's a way to help without threatening the eu , good do it . 
  just accept you ca n't save or help everyone . 
  what about the poor chinese people who are working as slaves making smartphones driving them into suicide .
