  where is the help for them , the public support ... 
  that 's a bald statement !, 
  yes, 
  shhhh ... this is the time for `` made in austria '' to rise : ^ ), 
  you ca n't win anyways , but i 'd rather not see turkish politicians spreading propaganda in austria . 
  i have a solution for this , we sit them in a train , and just drive them to germany , 
  the migration flow needs to be stop by any means . 
  because it wo n't stop alone and more many more will come . 
  austria already has one of the most refugees/migrants per capita . 
  it is simply not sustainable for us to take so many more . 
   `` austria will not carry out any controls on the brenner borders at the moment and it is not set to resort to using the army in the immediate future , '' so he said what is fact right now . 
  armored vehicles and 750 + soldiers are in barracks in tyrol . 
  they were never sent to the border , nor would they be sent if the situation does n't escalate . 
  if however italy decides to just wave the migrants through like greece and everyone else did in 2015 , our military will be ready to secure the borders . 
  this is the point of preparation . 
  why stop there ? 
  `` what do you think about putting together a really cool world where only i am welcome , that we 'll run until all others learn how to behave themselves ? '', 
  lets marry instead and take back all rightful clay !, 
  it 's common practice . 
  shoot yourself in the face and blame austria . 
  do n't argue with this guy , he is shitposting in both threads flamebating and spreading misinformation . . 
  obvious troll is obvious . 
  to add some insight . 
  ** no , the soldiers are not at the border ** , ** they are in barracks in tyrol ** , but ready at any time to secure the borders of austria . 
  the soldiers were sent there because intel was given that italy started ** relocating migrants from sicily to the italian mainland ** and it 's likely that like in 2015 migrants will be given a free pass again to roam north . 
  but i guess austria will be the boo-man of the eu again , like when closing the balkan route to stop the influx of migrants . 
  even though that austria has one of the highest refugee/migrant per capita rate in the eu . 
  so like in the article they go there sign the attendance and then leave again , basically the same as not showing up in the first place but they still get paid . 
  yes , i do n't understand why their salary is so out of proportion ? 
  in the austrian parliament they earn 8000 $ + per month . 
  why ? 
  doctors in hospitals earn less , i do n't even want to start talking about regular workers . 
  and all of that without any qualification requirement . 
  they always talk about that they work for the people and can relate to them . 
  how can you relate to people that earn 1/8 or 1/7 from you . 
  it 's actually mind blowing . 
  it 's probably the only job , where you do n't need to show up nor work or in general give even a single fuck but you get paid more than most of the people . 
  it 's just the same crying back when austria and the balkan states closed the balkan route . 
  it will be boo boo bad austria for a while but actually it 's the only reasonable thing to do . 
  do n't feed the troll . 
  obvious troll is obvious , he ca n't be this stupid . 
  will there be something done about the tax havens inside the eu ? 
  probably not . 
  probably like many things/words/sayings from the monarchy days . 
  but the `` this sounds spanish to me '' if you do n't understand anything should be well known too . 
  do i speak bohemian ? 
  this is what you would say if he does n't understand what you want from him , even if it 's clear . 
  `` die technik is a hund . '', 
  the technology is a dog . 
  if something technical is n't working . 
  `` threaten '' who ? 
  the people who profit from the crisis ? 
  i ca n't vote for anyone and having a good feeling about it . 
  maybe we should make our own party , 
  but i do n't see a government without them . 
  either sp\u00f6 or \u00d6vp will coalition with them . 
  i just wish the political discourse in austria would n't consist of `` look how bad they are , you need to vote for us . '', 
  because this just polarizes the people without solving any current problems . 
  but will he prevail ? 
  tune in in october , for the next episode of `` austria votes ... again '', 
  maybe they should do a study with crabs : ^ ), 
  the right wing party lost out a bit in polls because of the center right getting a popular candidate , but they are still second/third largest party . 
  and since center right/left ( \u00f6vp and sp\u00f6 ) broke up the goverment , i do n't see them form a coalition again . 
  therefore the far right party will be in the next goverment imho . 
  1453 worst year of my life . 
  let 's make a deal , we build a wing factory in vienna to supply the husaria . 
  and you support austrias claims on hungary , slovenia , s\u00fcd-tirol , trieste , transylvania , croatia , czechia , slovakia , krakow area ? 
  do n't mind hofer , this was the presidential election , who in austria is mostly representative . 
  in october austria will vote their goverment . 
  but we would need a name . . that sounds good . . hmm . . and maybe some clay around krakow . . gib pls, 
  remember , that if you put a crab ( or whatever ) into water and cook it slowly enough it will die without even noticing . 
  while if you throw it into boiling water , it might fight back . 
  poland stealing austrias spotlight d : rip, 
  wait for the cryout after the austrian elections in october and `` how bad austrian people are . '', 
  maybe we get sanctioned again by the eu , 
  if the percentage is positive , people think immigration has a positive effect . 
  if it 's negative it has a negative effect . 
  austria and the old crownlands so similar ... maybe we should make our own union with habsburgs and hookers . 
  will this be along the lines : we do n't send them mustard gas . 
  but we will send them mustard and gas and if they make mustard gas it 's not our fault . 
  or will there be an actual embargo ? 
  damn , 6/11 ... seems like i 'm anti-semite now , i did nazi that coming :(, 
  will the vote be public available ? 
  i want to see if austria gets more than 3 points . 
  maybe its meant as a metaphor ? 
  and austria . 
  i guess the nordics have the same reason as we . 
  we do n't have a general minimum wage , but we have `` kollektivvertr\u00e4ge '' which regulate the wage , but they are branch-specific . 
  poor austria , always forgotten . 
  austria or adobe ? 
  i just ca n't tell !, 
  maybe they use it because it 's easier to spell than `` criticizes '' ? 
  everyone taking part in those ngo 's should be brought before court for being part of a criminal association . 
  because this is what those ngo 's are , criminal organizations profiting from the mess . 
   `` help '' . 
  why not say it as it is ? 
  usa following their own goals . 
  they are n't doing this for anything other than self interest . 
  same with the invasions and destabilisation in the middle east . 
  the ( military ) presence in the whole world .
