the bike scene is definitely a parody of [ kanye west ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbatam7vtgc ), 
  when your camera is so bad , people think it 's an oil painting . 
  and fp\u00d6 . 
  i mean , norbert hofer has a real chance at the austrian presidency ( if we finally manage to hold an election ) and as the president he can dissolve the parliament and hold new elections . 
  which the fp\u00d6 will probably win as well . 
  when movies are doubt they remove the original voice track and they have professional voice actors speak the lines . 
  [ this is dubbed ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsdi1vsxipy ) ( it 's pulp fiction , btw ) [ top gear is pretty much the only show that has a voice over in german ] ( http://www.dmax.de/programme/top-gear/videos/top-gear-das-unkaputtbare-auto/ ) . 
  it 's awful . 
  i was looking for a chart like that . 
  you know that some people want stuff like a bigger screen , etc. 
  you only get 5.5 '' with an iphone 6/6s/7 plus, 
  the bubble is called : `` students that ca n't afford a $ 1.000 iphone '', 
  well , i see a lot of them . 
  not as much as iphone or samsung , but you do n't see as much tesla as audi or vw . 
  at least here in austria . 
  would you have read the article if it said , that there is an austrian start-up that is a competitor to bosch and siemens ? 
  oneplus did quite a good job with their first smartphone . 
  it 's not the best smartphone but if you were to compare it to other 300 - $ - android-phones it was definitely one of the best . 
  the bz\u00d6 was an offspring of the right-wing party fp\u00d6 . 
  mainly led by j\u00f6rg haider . 
  and they were one of the main players in the whole hypo alpe adria bank thing , which is going to cost austria several billions . 
  so ... yeah ... it 's kind of still funny after all ... 
  somebody in carinthia actually did this . 
  irrc he voted for bz\u00d6 and drew a penis next to another party on the ballot . 
  it was ruled out as not showing the voters intent . 
  hence the bz\u00d6 had lost one vote and it was quite close which meant , that they lost on seat in the local government because of this . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the us are like the only first world country , where a candidate with 500.000 votes less can actually become president . 
  well , the first time was n't really much different to any other elections . 
  they did this kind of stuff ( counting on the election day and not at the next day ) at every election the last years . 
  but with previous elections it did n't matter much , because the postal votes would n't make a significant difference . 
  however , this time the right-wing party had a candidate who could actually win ( and who was leading without the postal-votes and on monday it was announced that he lost by some 30.000 votes to the `` green-party '' - candidate van der bellen . 
  every political party in every country would question these results . 
  i mean in 2000 george w. bush won even though he had ~ 500.000 votes less than al gore . 
  bush won florida ( where his brother was governor ) and all of floridas electoral votes by 537 votes . 
  and there was a significant error in palm beach because they had some strange ballot design . 
  [ you can read more here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/florida_election_recount ) . 
  they needed more than a mount and several recounts to come to a final result . 
  but the new iphone 7 cost 's only 69.90 $ / month for 36 months . 
  that 's so cheap !, 
  honestly . 
  having a dish washer and a dryer are nice commodities but not absolutely necessary . 
  i used to live for at least 5 years without one . 
  a drying rack costs like 10 $ and if you 're on well fare you have enough time to do the dishes by hand . 
  there is not a 1cm wide glue-free patch . 
  some `` wahlkarten '' where completely open on both sides . 
  my own `` wahlkarte '' did n't have any glue at the bottom of the lid at all . 
  i could stick my whole hand under it . 
  and the glue was not very good as well . 
  i actually opened it again . 
  that 's just laughable . 
  i can only speak as an austrian , but a lot of germans do n't know that we actually do n't really like germans either . 
  i 've had a lot of colleagues at university who were quite astounded about this . 
  in austria it mostly comes from maintaining our own national identity , maybe it 's something similar for the people from poland . 
  well ... i do n't think , that austria would be any better than [ estonia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy_phvhe4os&amp;t=41m28s ), 
  it looks like it . 
  the first time round they were not really careful with when then are allowed to open and count them and no they have difficulties with the production . 
  it 's such a joke . 
  of course ... i was just mimicking the public outcry after this story first became public :d, 
  [ do we ? 
  ] ( http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/wien/5065166/raetsel-um-obdachlosensperre-in-park-gelost ), 
  they wanted to join and in 2010 they even started discussing the terms of joining the eu but in 2013 they held an referendum and they decided that they want to stay independent . 
  norway is also not in the eu . 
  [ well , whatever ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_presidential_election_in_florida,_2000 ), 
  the difference between the two candidates was only 30.000 votes . 
  and effected by the possibility ( ! ), 
  of a fraud were more than 80.000 votes . 
  so an overturn of the vote actually makes kind of a bit sense . 
  if it was like a 10 % lead for one of the candidate i do n't think that they would have overturned it . 
  well , irrc the bz\u00d6 lost a seat in the local parliament of carinthia by one seat , because somebody drew a penis on the ballot . 
  also the serbian company where the right-wing party ordered the publicity material . 
  thanks for that , iceland . 
  even though iceland is beating the shit out of the other teams in the euro , they are not in the eu . 
  if french is becoming the main language of the eu i 'm gon na vote for the \u00d6xit . 
  or austri ( a ) tt . 
  thanks , edited it, 
  the tweet you sent took \u00d6zdemirs statements out of context . 
  [ here is another one , that is mentioned in this tweet ] ( http://www.deutscharmenischegesellschaft.de/materialien/der-genozid-an-den-armeniern/vor-dem-deutschen-bundestag2/cem-ozdemir-schreiben-an-die-dag/ ) ( also in german , but maybe google translate works with this one ) what he was asking for ( 15 years ago , btw ) was that the turkish state should work out by itself how it should handle its own history . 
  he wrote one in favour for it , at least as far as i know . 
  but please , if you have another source , i would be happy if you could provide me with that . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hghbbashihu ), 
  what is interesting is , that cem \u00d6zdemir , son of turkish immigrants , was one of the main players behind the recognition of the armenian genocide . 
  they did they same back in april with austria . 
  i do n't even care if he already sent him back or not . 
  technically speaking , even arabs are asians , because they live on the asian continent . 
  in austria at least we consider chinese , japanese , korean and people from southeast asia as asian , people from pakistan and indian as indians ( sorry , but we do n't see the differences as much as you do ) and people from the middle-east as arabs or oriental . 
  i love kangaroos !, 
  or i love sound of music !, 
   lecker triggered !!!!, 
   oulu [ looks fine to me ] ( https://esnoulu.org/sites/esnoulu.org/files/styles/zoom/public/events/images/iceholesw_1.jpg?itok=lnr7mtmh ), 
  case in point : morocco you can travel to morocco without much problems . 
  maybe some crooks that overcharge you , because you 're a tourist , but that 's gon na happen nearly everywhere . 
  however , here in austria we still have some local problems ( e.g. 
  innsbruck , salzburg and linz ) with refugees from morocco . 
  that 's just ridiculously stupid ... and that 's definitely a point where the eu should work together and show some strength . 
  germany has the gorch fork . 
  and the us coast guard uses the `` eagle '' . 
  how much is it ? 
  if i recall the beer prices correctly from my last visit this is about 300.000 $ , right ?
