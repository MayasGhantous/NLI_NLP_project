  what about vatican city ? 
  orf ( the public broadcaster ) did a test with nutella from hungary against nutella from austria in hungary and the people liked the hungarian version more . 
  according to ferrero they create slightly different variations for different countries because the preferred tastes are a bit different . 
  the actors are mostly british and irish and most scenes are filmed in europe . 
  oh , and it 's on hbo , which is not a public tv station . 
  in most european countries it 's fine to show nudity after 9 or 10pm on the public broadcasters . 
   vancouver is one of the least livable countries in the world til : vancouver seceded from canada, 
  as of right now . 
  both , txl and sxf were closed yesterday and today because of strikes . 
  and ber is not gon na open until 2019 . 
  til : zurich is tiny compared to vienna . 
  even though both countries have about the same population ( 8.3 vs. 8.6 million people ) only ~ 400.000 live in zurich , the biggest city of switzerland . 
  nevertheless , it 's somewhat true . 
  [ the economist ranks vienna as second best ] ( http://pages.eiu.com/rs/783-xmc-194/images/liveability_august2016.pdf ) ( only 0.1 points behind melbourne ) and [ monocle has vienna as 3rd ] ( https://skift.com/2016/06/22/monocles-new-quality-of-life-top-25-cities-survey-tokyo-is-tops-again/ ) . 
  you do n't have cigarettes vending machines ? 
  at least in austria , your date of birth is saved on your bank card and you just stick it into the vending machine , it reads your age and if you 're older then 16 you can proceed to buy cigarettes . 
  is there a trump hotel in serbia ? 
   here in sweden , a lot of stores have adopted a system where you use a terminal in the store to print a note for condoms , tobacco and some other stuff ... you then go to the register , they scan the note , give you a receipt with a bar code on , which you then scan at a kind of vending machine by the exit that gives you the ware . 
  that seems overly complicated . 
  why not just make it a vending machine , that just happens to be located inside a store ? 
  [ i 've found the exact dialog that happened beforehand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsaezpbpwbc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=131 ), 
   why do these northern countries focus so much into english ? 
  ever been to finland ? 
  imported tv shows and movies ( except maybe something made for kids ) are in english with subtitles . 
  you kind of have to learn english to watch these shows without having to read all the time . 
  there also is n't that much content on the internet in finish , so you have to focus on learning another language . 
  i ca n't complain about our new beaches in carinthia .

  also 7.8 on quality of life ? 
  [ so that 's why we 're number one in the quality of life index 2017 ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/quality-of-life/rankings_by_country.jsp ) ?

  well , not exactly , it 's downhill , super g , giant slalom , slalom , combination , super combination and team events combined -  also called alpine skiing, 
  pretty much . 
  it 's the sum of all ski world cup points by each nation . 
  austria has won this ranking since 1990 . 
  [ tell me more ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationencup ), 
  [ austrian skiiers did the same in december 1998 .

  [ effectively germany is the 4th largest electoral district of turkey ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_germany#turkish_politics ) . 
  i do n't know about other countries were there is such a large turkish population that is also allowed to vote back home in turkey . 
   can someone explain the point of these campaigns ? 
  because there are 1,5 millions turks living in germany . 
  and unlike austria , turks in germany are allowed to hold dual-citizenship , which means , that they are allowed to vote in elections as well . 
  vatican city actually produces nobody , because their citizenship is neither jus sanguinis nor jus soli but jus officii , so you ca n't be born a citizen of vatican . 
   austro-turks especially in austria , there should be such a thing . 
  at least not from a legal standpoint . 
  if you take on the austrian citizenship you automatically lose your previous ( e.g. 
  turkish ) one . 
  but turkey issues no turkish passports to turks who just acquired an austrian one .

  [ but there are a lot more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_euro_commemorative_coins ), 
  so ... a d\u00fcr\u00fcm ? 
  austria also conscripts ~ 26.000 men each year . 
  so i guess it counts as training . 
   burgenland burgenland only has some 290.000 people ( 15.000 aged between 20 and 25 ) , which makes it the least populated federal state . 
  furthermore , it 's quite close to vienna and graz and there is not really any higher education , which means , that a lot of people aged 18-24 move away from there .

  [ peter box ?
