  in austrian german i would just say , that i paid `` an zehner '' for it .

  also in austria ... 
  til andr\u00e9 rieu is considered austrian even though he actually is dutch . 
   is n't dominated by one language english kind of became a lingua franca of tourism ... 
   5 % of inhabitants of luxembourg claim to speak and understand spanish , making it the highest penetration of spanish speakers in europe outside spain . 
  the last time i checked , portugal ( 10 % spanish speakers ) was still part of europe . 
  also france ( 14 % ) . 
  and italy ( 11 % ) . 
  and sweden and the uk ( both 6 % , same as luxembourg ) . 
  also romania and the netherlands are not too far off with 5 % of the population speaking spanish . 
  also donald trump has just been officially elected .

   is absolutely disgusting and smells strongly of piss [ they used an organic binding agent to keep the sandy ground from sinking and thereby damaging the stephansdom . 
  however , the binding agent is reacting with groundwater and creates a butyric acid .

  and as for the rest , i 've no idea in which parts of vienna you 've been , but i 'm living in one of the `` roughest '' ones ( 10th district ) and i barely see panhandlers . 
  yes , you do see them in the more touristy areas , however , a lot of them are part of the so-called `` bettelmafia '' , illegal groups who collect all of the earnings for their personal gain . 
  [ some of these groups actually come from romania . 
  austria has never really been in favour of turkey joining the eu . 
  polls in 2006 showed , that as much as 81 % of austrians disagreed with turkey joining the eu . 
  that figure is probably even higher today . 
  obviously , after erdogan imprisoned critical journalists and said that he was thinking about reinstating the death penalty there was no way that austria would suddenly support turkey joining the eu . 
  but why ? 
  everyone in austria is allowed to vote . 
  you only have to have some kind of photo-id ( passport , identity card , weapons pass , student id , drivers license ( not always accepted ) , ... ) or an identity witness ( family member , etc. ), 
  who has an id and who can confirm that this is said person . 
  no need for voter registration . 
  as you can see , i posted this 6 hours ago when the national broadcaster said that 1 % more people turned out to vote this time round . 
  i 'm sorry for not having accurate data right after the polls were closed . 
  i voted 4 times , because postal vote . 
  i was about the send out my ballot for october 4th when they postponed it . 
  i actually voted for `` der kleber kommt aus deutschland '' as sentence of the year . 
  technically yes , but only under the leadership of j\u00f6rg haider ( from 1986 onwards ) the fp\u00d6 really became a major player in the political landscape of austria, 
  actually no , * they see me rollin ' , they hatin ' * [ it 's a joke on chamillionaire 's * ridin ' * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctwjvgpj9xw ), 
  basically , to become president of austria you have to get 50 % + 1 vote . 
  in the first round there were 6 candidates : * alexander van der bellen , former leader of the green party , running as an independent * norbert hofer , from the right wing fp\u00d6 * irmgard griss , former judge , running as an independent * rudolf hundstorfer , from the social democratic sp\u00d6 * andreas khol , from the conservatice \u00d6vp * richard lugner , tv-personality and millionaire who was running as independent because none of them had more than 50 % there was a second round with the winner and the second place of the first election . 
  this was then ruled as not valid and had to be held again and then also the date was changed because the postal votes were flawed . 
  this means , that a lot of conservative voters or voters from the social-democratic party voted for either candidate because there was no candidate of their own party . 
  however , the orf included the postal votes in their projection . 
  but 53.6 % is only a bit left . 
  that 's ok . 
  it 's more like trump took some pages from the fp\u00d6s playbook . 
  we had these people since the 1990ies . 
  kickl is even worse tbh, 
  yes , 46,7 % of 84 % percent of austrian adults voted for hofer . 
  but a lot of them usually vote for \u00d6vp ( the conservative party ) or other parties . 
  you ca n't say that fp\u00d6 is going to get anywhere near the 46,7 % of norbert hofer in the next election . 
  van der bellen 's lead is 3.6 % and the variation is \u00b1 1.2 % . 
  so mathematically van der bellen already won . 
  especially because urban areas and postal voters tend to vote more for left ( ish ) candidates . 
  it 's not so much about overall turnout but about voter mobilisation . 
  and it looks like van der bellen was better at this . 
  the last polls closed at 5pm . 
  actually more people voted this time . 
  that 's incredible . 
  i 'm stupid , sry . 
  no , it did not . 
  they just had a different result which included the projection of postal votes . 
  especially because he is usually doing better with postal votes . 
  and this result is without them . 
   paulers who ? 
   infamy just invite some instagramers to these places ... 
   i 'm grumpy about slow people on the elevator and such found the guy from vienna . 
  ( i hate them too ), 
   and pretty much 90 % of service industry workers are in no mood to serve . 
  they all look tired and repelled by tourists .
