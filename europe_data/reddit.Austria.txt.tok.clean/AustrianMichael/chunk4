  are n't the tourists the ones that pay for their marked up food and drinks ? 
  without tourists they would soon be out of business because the natives do n't want to pay these prices ... 
  it is . 
  and technically audi , vw and porsche are also owned by the same company , the volkswagen ag, 
  i 've read bill browders book `` red notice '' and it just appears that he is salty that somebody ( putin ) outsmarted him . 
  he genuinely lost the opportunity of becoming one of the richest person on the planet ... 
  poor opel ... not even the other german automakers like them enough to let them take part in their cartel ... 
   spa for men [ definitely not ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3ypx3aralq&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=15 ), 
  [ the grand tour went there ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kingacthjwo ), 
  [ they have an interesting choice of actress in their commercials as well ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zwupq-wko0 ), 
  [ this wikipedia article is based on data by the unhcr ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_refugee_population ) . 
  germany had at this time , when germany closed its borders , 3.1 refugees per 1000 people while austria hosted 7.13 refugees per 1000 people . 
   germany remains as a forerunner of humanitarian assistance , and we 're continually learning from our experiences . 
  so that 's why austria was forced to take in more refugees per capita then germany because you closed our common border and introduced hourly/daily quotas ? 
  my `` aldi '' ( it 's called hofer in austria ) has a security at the exit . 
  tells you enough about the part of town i live in ... 
  people just take them and stuff them into their pockets . 
  it 's just ridiculous to what length people go to save a few cents or to save themself the trouble of bringing a cloth bag . 
  good luck trying this in favoriten . 
  the people did n't even understood why there are no plastic bags at the checkout anymore . 
  they kept asking for them , because they used them every day . 
  yes , that 's exactly my sentiment towards these people . 
  most of them know , that they are going to a store , so what 's so hard about bringing a backpack or some cloth bag or something similar to carry your stuff home . 
  i put the stuff i buy in a cloth bag all the time . 
  however , it 's the only stuff that 's in there , so when i put the stuff at the conveyor belt at the check they see that the bag is empty . 
  i love cloth bags . 
  if you have a brand and want me to advertise for free , just give me a free cloth bag and you can be sure that i 'll be using it ... 
  amazon is already using `` frustfreie verpackung '' , which is made mostly out of cardboard . 
  they really cut down on plastic usage . 
  my nearest hofer is only accessible by foot , so you ca n't take the cart outside to put your stuff in the car . 
  so you have to have some kind of bag to carry your stuff home ... 
  [ yes , here is one in its natural habitat during winter ] ( https://www.thelocal.at/userdata/images/1422454253_klkaenguru.jpg ), 
  also the small ones for fruits and vegetables ? 
  because right now , they already got rid of the big plastic bags ( at least here in austria ) you get at the checkout but people now just take 3 or 4 of the small plastic bags meant for fruits and vegetables and just stick all of their groceries in them after checkout . 
  naughty ... 
   a 200 $ bill i got one from my grandparents once . 
  that 's pretty much the only time i saw one . 
   in germany pay with cards lol . 
  what ? 
  do n't they have all kinds of stupid germany-specific payment systems like `` geldkarte '' or `` ec-karte '' and the like ? 
  in finland they did n't accept my 1 cent coins i brought from austria ... 
  great idea . 
  as a slogan i would propose [ a.e.i.o.u. ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a.e.i.o.u . ), 
  [ say what again ? 
  ] ( http://www.bundesheer.at/pool/img/0145_boot.jpg ), 
   of the schengen agreement lol . 
  just look at the austrian-german border . 
   germany is one of the few that helps you and you still shit on them while austria and hungary are the ones letting you rot . 
  guess who blocked it 's borders to austria in 2015 when a lot of migrants where arriving through the balkan route ? 
  guess who said that it 's barbaic of austrians foreign minister to close the balkan route ? 
  germany is the root of all evil in this . 
  and then they fuck us austrians over by just deciding to close their borders so that the refugees are stuck in austria . 
  well , papua new guinea is not exactly a modern state either . 
  and it 's only 150 kilometres to mainland australia from there . 
  vienna , because there is a better ( the best ) quality of life and we already have experience with international organisations ( opec , un , unhcr , iaeo , osze , etc. ), 
  well , the [ marshall islands are about to disappear due to climate change ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/12/02/world/the-marshall-islands-are-disappearing.html ) , so it might be interesting and helpful to hear standpoints of somebody who is personally effected by the effects of climate change . 
  [ here you go ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0gr2s876vg ) . 
  seems a bit complicated . 
  at 1:44:50 bill clinton is lip synching ... 
   a set of coins from each country i have a 1 $ coin from monaco . 
  that 's pretty rare i guess ... 
  imagine the smell in the car . 
  awesome . 
   i wish i 'd appreciated my teenage years when none of this was happening in europe on this scale .

  [ here 's a video about how you make a spiegel cover ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyal2p42l_u&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=57 ), 
  that adds another level of shitty action film to the whole story ... would make an excellent plot for a french version of scandal ... 
   next to switzerland and liechtenstein and germany . 
  and czechia . 
  and hungary . 
  and slovenia . 
  and italy . 
  well , the episode came out after his [ 2000 presidential run ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donald_trump_presidential_campaign,_2000 ) . 
  / r/shittybattlestations, 
   apartments are at least $ 20,000 lol . 
  what ? 
  a 30 sqm apartment in favoriten ( one of vienna 's worse districts ) will cost you at least ~ 100.000 $, 
  furthermore , it raises awareness about not just dumping your trash somewhere . 
  when the government just cleans it nobody cares about it . 
  i 'm not an expert in street art or generally in painting walls , but how does one paint something like this without somebody noticing it ? 
  it 's not like one of the stencil by banksy that takes only a few minutes to spray ... 
  and austrians . 
  til : there is murauer milk as well ... 
   she fucks up and her party has no chances in the future that 's not true . 
  we have the fp\u00d6 in austria and they were part of a legislation from 2000 to 2003 , embezzled a lot of money and voters just forget about shit like that a few years later . 
  just exchange the leaders of the party and voila ... you can compete again against the other parties . 
   the most economic sense that 's the point . 
  they should also factor in ecological costs ... which right now they are n't ... 
  i know ... one german name for it is actually `` chinesische stachelbeere '' ... with `` native '' i meant that most kiwis are grown there ... 
   he lived in vienna he lived in vienna around 1913 ... so did stalin , trotsky , freud and hitler ... 
  personally , i think that 's one of the stupider things that 's happening in the eu . 
  i ca n't believe that it 's `` cheaper '' to transport food across europe just because it 's a few cents cheaper to produce in another country . 
  we have the same shit [ happening in austria ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000056004228/steirischer-kren-aus-tschechien-kraeftemessen-beim-krenreiben ) . 
  there is a special kind of horseradish in styria , called `` steirischer kren '' . 
  there are two companies that sell it under the same name , one big vegetable company and one smaller company . 
  the bigger company is harvesting the horseradish in styria , because otherwise they would n't be allowed to call it `` steirischer kren '' ( much like champagne from the champagne in france ) and then they transport it to czechia to process it and then they transport it back to austria to sell it in supermarkets all across the country . 
  are n't kiwis native to new zealand ?
