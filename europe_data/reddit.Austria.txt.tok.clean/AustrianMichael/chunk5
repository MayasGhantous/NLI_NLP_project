  to be fair , they asked them to show it on a europe-centered ( with the atlantic in the middle ) world map instead of the usual us-centered . 
  if you walked out to the streets and asked people where north korea is on a us-centered map they would certainly have troubles finding it .

  germans and their inability to integrate in other countries . 
  i sometimes work during the summer on a mountain cabin which serves to a lot of tourists and germans are by far the most arrogant customers . 
  not only do they not use local culinary terms ( wtf is an apfelschorle ???? 
  ) , they do n't tip and they get angry that there are no `` pommes '' ( fries ) at a cabin at about 2.000 meter above sea level ... and you can really notice how they talk down to austrians and especially people working in the service industry .

  have you ever seen a cigarette vending-machine in austria ? 
  you need an austrian bank card where you age is saved to buy them . 
  generally they are not located in public places . 
  we had one dedicated to beer in my former dorm as well . 
  otherwise they would need the same age verification as cigarette machines . 
  fanta naranja ( spain )  fanta in austria seriously , it tastest a lot more like oranges and a lot less fizzy . 
  to extend on 5 , there is something called `` wahlpflichtgegenstand '' , where you have to take a selection of additional courses .

  history ) or an additional language . 
  i did n't grew up there ... so i know what it 's like to live in the countryside ... 
  i know . 
  but i think , that it 's crazy that you ca n't , for example , buy a tramway ticket in vienna with a card . 
  that 's just stupid . 
  recently , an american asked me if i could change his 5 $ note into coins , because otherwise he could n't buy a ticket in the tramway . 
  what ? 
  have you ever used contactless payment ? 
  it 's soooo much quicker , especially if you have some old lady in front of you who is looking through her collection of 1 and 2 cent coins to find a 5 cent coin ... 
  instead i pull out the card of my [ wallet ] ( http://imgur.com/teerblm ) , hold it to the display of the payment machine and after less than 5 seconds it 's done . 
  i can put the card back in my wallet and go . 
   we built a ~ 700mw plant to completion in the 70s and then had a public vote where we decided we did n't want to use it after all . 
  that 's so austrian , i ca n't even tell you . 
  1.6 billion $ for something we do n't even use . 
  it 's just so crazy ... 
  i would love to pay more with cards here in austria , but the industry is actively working against this goal . 
  generally speaking , bigger chains ( clothing , food , etc. ), 
  all accept card payments . 
  however , it is a different story with small chains or even independent ones . 
  there are some caf\u00e9s that actively advertise that they do n't offer card payment . 
  also a lot of austrian `` fast food chains '' just do n't offer card payments , even though they are situated in train stations with a lot of tourists . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  especially in vienna , restaurants accept card payments , but it 's better to tell them , when you ask for your check that you want to pay with card , because they usually expect people to pay cash . 
  also i 've only seen one kebap shop and one wurstel stand that accepted card payment . 
  furthermore , if you want to buy a ticket for the tramway ( wiener linien ) in the tramway , good look without cash . 
  they only accept coins and a ticket is 2,30 $ :( same with public toilets . 
  you need to take an urgent dump ? 
  hopefully you brought 50 cents . 
  i 've only seen the toilet at the main train station and the westbahnhof accepting cards . 
   and this way i do n't have to rely on electronics and systems that could go down any moment . 
  atms can go down as well ... 
  it 's so sad :-( but true ... especially restaurants and bars are really unwilling to accept cards ... or they introduce an illegal minimum charge ...

   berghain do n't . 
  unless you want to stay in line for ages and then just do n't get in . 
   but if there 's something more popular amongst europeans and other tourists why the hell do you want to go where everybody else is going ? 
  mallorca for example is very popular but this leads to the whole island being clogged up with rental cars and people at the beach . 
  i would much rather go somewhere with less tourists and enjoy a nice , clean and quiet beach .

  more like `` hausname '', 
  same in austria . 
  it was built in the beginning of the 20th century .
