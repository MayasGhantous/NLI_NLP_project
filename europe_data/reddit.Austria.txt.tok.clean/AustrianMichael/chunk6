  same restaurants . 
  every fucking year . 
   they had one of those ugly tourist house in those huge lots where there are only tourists in a place where there seemed to be only the beach and bars . 
  that painfully reminds me of all my childhood holidays in lignano , italy . 
  probably one of the ugliest places in italy to go on vacation . 
  * shops close at 7-8pm on weekdays , 6pm on saturday and they are closed on sunday * we 're appear rude unless you give us some alcohol to open up * smoking indoors * we have n't seen the sound of music . 
  literally nobody in austria has seen it . 
  germany . 
  well , not paris , but the bordeaux region is certainly doable . 
  it depends where you live . 
  some towns in certain valleys wo n't get any direct sun for a few weeks ... 
  i think you should go to either madrid , barcelona ( and maybe some other places at the iberian peninsula ( portugal is nice , for example ) ) or to the centre of europe ( geneva , vienna and berlin ) . 
  you can add portugal to your trip to spain . 
  the bachelor degree in economics on the university of vienna is only in german . 
  you 'll need *** b2 german *** . 
   wien university which one ? 
  keep in mind , that most bachelor degrees are in german . 
  even for english-language degree you 'll need more like c1 then b2 . 
  in austria we usually just round up to the next 50 cent or to the next full euro . 
  a beer is $ 3,20 ? 
  say `` 3 , f\u00fcnfzig '' and you 'll get change for $ 3,50 . 
  if it 's a bit more expensive ( e.g. 
  dinner and a few beers ) you can also round up a bit more , e.g. 
  $ 17,80 you can just give them $ 20 .

  you can thank jay-z , because he [ `` made the yankee hat more famous than a yankee can '' ] ( https://youtu.be/1tc02vab1rw?t=181 ), 
  in australia it 's 1.14 cattle per capita and in austria it 's something like 0.21 cattle per capita , which is higher than the eu average at 0.18 cattle per capita . 
  to me it sounded perfectly fine . 
  a lot better then most austrians . 
  they did n't speak rallye driver english , so that made things a lot better :d, 
  since you know what you 're talking about ... what kind of mustard is usually served with it ? 
   leberk\u00e4se to improve upon this , there is pferdeleberk\u00e4se , made from horse meat . 
  delicious . 
  just do n't expect to get it everywhere in vienna . 
  it 's quite rare to find a good one here . 
  one should try salzburg or linz . 
  personally , i think that people in their mid-20ies who do n't speak english at a somewhat conversational level are a bit dumb . 
  especially in times of the internet it 's quite easy to immerse yourself in english ( e.g. 
  movies , books , news , reddit , ... ) . 
  are you serious ? 
  i 've been to finland and people working in supermarkets speak better and clearer english then some of my professors at the university here in austria ... 
   elementary i had two hours of english per week in elementary school and that was in the countryside in the late 90ies . 
  smoking ban in clubs , bars , restaurants , public places , etc. 
  talking about my salary ? 
  not gon na happen .

   i bet you can even see them in the czech republic which is n't far away from where i took this photo . 
  i live in the alps and on a clear day i can see b\u00f6hmerwald , which is pretty much czechia . 
  that you 're a similar but inferior type of austrians ? 
  yes , i 'll admit to that . 
  i know . 
  it 's still interesting how the difference between an opt-in and an opt-out system plays out in two countries with a similar type of population . 
  it 's forbidden to have a royal title as an austrian citizen . 
  the fine if you decide to refer to yourself by your `` title '' is a whopping 0,14 $ .

  still . 
  there are huge traffic jams on the german-austrian border every day now . 
  even if they let in everybody it 's a huge pain in the ass if you have to cross it every other day . 
  funny thing is , that they only control the borders with the heaviest traffic . 
  if you just cross in the town of braunau for example there is no control . 
  so somebody with malicious intend could just use one of these hundreds of different crossings . 
   free travel you 're aware of the current border controls on the german-austrian border , right ? 
   austria prague , bratislava and budapest are perfectly fine to go to for a weekend . 
  munich is a bit of a stretch but with one additional free day easily doable ... ( from vienna ), 
   helsinki cathedral as far as churches in helsinki go , the [ temppeliaukio church ] ( http://www.hiddenarchitecture.net/2015/10/temppeliaukio-church.html ) is probably the coolest one ... 
  bavarians themself do n't like munich , because there are so many non-bavarians living there ... 
   it journalists  know how the news are made translating 1:1 from us news outlets like mashable and gizmodo ? 
   here 's a video comparing justin trudeau talking about quantum computing , and trump talking about uranium . 
  trump sounds like a slow 5-year-old . 
  that 's cute .

  especially younger people in austria can speak english fairly well , so this should n't really be a problem . 
  however , it gets a lot worse if you speak to people that are 35 and older . 
  hallstatt is quite nice and it 's not too far from salzburg, 
   with no internet connection iirc you can download the files in google translate for offline use . 
   lederhosen that 's more of an austrian/bavarian thing ... 
  same in german : gewalt = violence gewaltig = huge, 
  i really like mustard actually .

  do n't forget the beer . 
  the last time i checked we were the country with the second highest per capita consumption of beer . 
  but generally speaking austrians do exercise nearly as much as the scandinavian countries . 
  hiking for example is fairly popular in austria , especially in the countryside . 
  i started with spanish on duolingo but i 'm currently more into re-learning french ( i had 4 years in school and forgot pretty much all of it ), 
  it 's called hamburger royal ts at mcdonald 's in austria . 
  til . 
  thank you . 
  i was mislead because some clubs have an english sign and it usually says `` wardrobe '', 
  well , we usually pre-game at somebodies place . 
  everybody brings his own drinks ( so i pay ~ 50 cents for a can of ottakringer ) . 
  admission ( if there is any ) is something like 5-10 $ . 
  wardrobe is 2 $ . 
  1 beer with tip is usually something like 4-5 $ . 
  kebap/pizza/noodles / [ leberk\u00e4ssemmel ] ( http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7166/6840140931_28be60afab.jpg ) / [ k\u00e4sekrainer ] ( http://diepresse.com/images/uploads/c/5/4/1600596/9ddf8680-ccb6-4494-a169-14c5495a7399_v0_l.jpg ) are something like 3-4 $ so overall i would say : * 6 cans of beer ( 0,5 l ) -  4 $ * admission -  5 $ * wardrobe -  2 $ * 4 more beers ( 0,5 l ) -  18 $ * food -  3 $ ------------------------ * sum : 32 $ but it really depends on where you 're going . 
  i tend to frequent bars without admission and a wardrobe , which makes it cheaper ... if you decided to go to the more upscale clubs you can expect 5 $ for 0,33 l bottles of heineken and 10 $ admission ... 
  dutch , especially shorter sentences/words work fine .
