  even spoken i kind of get the meaning . 
  i 've been watching the videos by [ drugslab ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucvrqkxtigck1yenq4te8hwq ) recently and i hardly need the subtitles . 
  i mostly use `` tschechien '' in german so czechia comes a lot more natural to me . 
  `` let 's go to czechia for fireworks and casinos '' sounds better then `` let 's go the czech republic for fireworks and casinos '' . 
  i can confirm that . 
  i was only allowed to work on the morning ( 6 am to half past 2pm ) shift . 
  i can only speak for austria , but our school system is a bit different . 
  people who only did the mandatory 9 years of schooling usually start with an apprenticeship and they actually get an education on a specific job ( e.g. 
  mechanic , builder , ... ) or you can add 3 to 4 more years of school and earn a `` matura '' , which allows you to study at a university ( for free , btw ) . 
  people who do an apprenticeship obviously work and people who keep going to school usually do n't have time to work 20h a week due to stuff like homework and learning , etc. 
  most of these pupils work for a month during summer to earn some money for holidays and such ( i worked for a month to pay for my first computer , for example ) . 
  i went to a private school and pretty much everybody had some kind of `` summer job '' . 
  some were just making coffee and printing stuff in their parents office and others were really working hard in car manufacturing jobs ... 
   we do n't think that our country is the center of the universe . 
  that 's a nice sentence for a country that used the phrase [ a.e.i.o.u ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a.e.i.o.u . ), 
  in the past . 
  i 'm always amazed how easy it is to read dutch if you understand german ... 
  [ sounds reasonable ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liechtenstein#security_and_defence ), 
  potatoes in all its glorious variations ( i often cut them up in similar sized fries , mix them with some olive oil , paprika and garlic powder and put them in a preheated oven for roughly 30 minutes ) or something simple like pasta with tuna ... 
  [ grammelschmalzbrot ] ( http://flipregionalfood.pbworks.com/f/1277881144/grammelschmalz.jpg ) is the shit . 
  so nice . 
  * first beer with 14 * first ( and since then only ) time to much coke & rum with 14 * occasional drinks ( beer or vodka-red bull ) from 15 onwards * beer pretty regularly from 18 onwards ( legal from age 16 ) and especially since i moved to vienna with 19, 
  there is one next to 25hours hotel in vienna . 
  but it 's pretty much fixed there . 
  `` w\u00fcrstelst\u00e4nde '' used to be mobile trollies ... before they became pretty much fixed installments ... 
  fair point ... but if you were expecting a great amusement park ( how it 's advertised ) you 're going to be disappointed ... 
  the wurstelprater in vienna . 
  a lot of attractions are abandoned and they have an 80ies feeling to it . 
  including the music and everything ... 
   earn fat stacks . 
  i always found that poorer people make more unhealthy eating decision ? 
  i work in it and i can basically come and go whenever i want . 
  the only things are a mandatory lunch-break if you 're working longer than 6 hours and a maximum working time of 10 hours , after which you have to take a iirc 10 hour break . 
  i usually come into work from 7:45 to 8:15 and go home between 4 or 5 pm . 
  fridays are a bit shorter . 
  overall i have to work 38,5 hours/week . 
  casual clothes are accepted and because i do n't really have meetings with anyone important i usually go with a basic t-shirt/polo , jeans and `` casual sneaker '' ( currently simple , black vans and similar shoes from adidas and nike ) . 
   german-speaking countries ( germany , austria , and sometimes switzerland ) and liechtenstein that 's pretty much it . 
  i personally think that culturally poland , czechia , slovakia and hungary are more eastern european . 
  may 1st is already a holiday . 
  and then there is easter and whitsun , etc. 
   second best would be oct 30th or nov 2nd . 
  no , please not . 
  i want something in july or august . 
  you can go outside , have a bbq , etc. 
  something like australia day or 4th of july . 
  in all seriousness . 
  there is an episode of top gear where they try to say doppelkupplungsgetriebe . 
  if you split it up in separate words it 's quite easy to understand : doppel-kupplungs-getriebe = double clutch gearbox and even though a lot of youtube-channels say that it 's an actual word : nobody says backpfeifengesicht - at least not in the civilised parts of the german speaking world . 
   nut butter [ disgusting ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nut+butter&amp;defid=69382 ), 
  [ riiiggghhhttt ] ( https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/03/24/name-change-to-hitler-official/99587276/ ) he would be in jail in austria . 
  to extend on this , most restaurants/bars have a `` hausbier '' , which is usually a widely known lager / `` helles '' / `` m\u00e4rzen '' beer ( e.g. 
  ottakringer , zipfer , g\u00f6sser , puntigamer , ... )  kleines there is also a `` pfiff '' , which is 0.2 litres . 
  i usually do n't need a shopping cart , because a basket holds enough stuff and i have a 1 year ticket , so i do n't have to buy a ticket every time i take the bus . 
  the only real obstacles are going out and paying for toilets . 
  i 'm fine with paying something like 50 cent for a clean toilet . 
  however , please please please also make it possible to pay cashless . 
  i 've started to seldom carry cash ( which is quite brave in a country like austria ) and i encounter cash only toilets all the time . 
  only train stations start to roll out the possibility to pay cashless as well . 
  edit : and what really bugs me as well is how few parks and such have toilets . 
  it sucks if you 're at the park and have to go the next train station just to use the toilet . 
   cyprus , malta you might want to check which countries are in the eu ... i mean ... it 's only 13 years since they joined ... 
  i used to have a roommate who stayed with me for roughly two years . 
  in these two years in vienna he did n't even care to really learn german . 
  i mean , if somebody lives in a german speaking city for two years and all he can say is `` i habe zu \u00fcben mehr deutsch sprechen '' it 's quite shameful . 
  i know german is hard , but he was rich enough to afford a language course and after two years of living in a country and not being able to form simple sentences it just gets annoying and it makes him look ignorant . 
  i 've seen it in aldi in mallorca . 
  it was probably just a seasonal product which they carry for a few weeks but they are usually coming back after a few months ... 
  as far as fast food goes , i would love to see and in-n-out in europe . 
  i only really heard good things about it and i 'm kind of tired of having only the choice between mcdonald 's and burger king when you want fast food burger ... 
  i always had the feeling that american pastries and breakfast food never really had a chance here in europe . 
  i live in vienna and dunkin' donuts had to close several locations because the people here did n't really care to buy 2 $ donuts that were n't even good when you can get better local pastries cheaper . 
  / r/aeiou is leaking again ... 
  do they even know how to run a facebook-group ? 
  you can have an admin pre-approve of all postings . 
  if they see somebody posting bullshit about turkey all the time , just ban them from the group . 
  actually , the austrian right-wing party fp\u00d6 is actively supporting the serbian community in vienna . 
  the serbs in austria are against more immigration because the new immigrants make it harder for them to find jobs and living space . 
  [ fp\u00d6 candidate hofer even visited belgrade and said that he will support serbia if he became president of austria ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000047231173/hofer-besprach-mit-praesident-nikolic-staatspolitisches ), 
  i just hope that everyone in their marketing department got a huge rise for this joke . 
  thanks . 
  i did n't realise that at first . 
  what about kia ? 
  it should be will will write a will ? 
  because the second one is a name , right ? 
  it is said that the d\u00f6ner kebab sandwich was first introduced in germany in the 1970s . 
  ... ahhh !, 
  tinder is quite common in europe as well . 
  `` dating '' ( like it is portrayed in us movies ) is not really a thing here . 
  you might meet up for a drink or a coffee but going out for dinner is definitely something for couples and not for dates . 
  most couples i know met through common friends or through school/university/work but some also while going out and partying . 
  is d\u00f6ner kebab still not a thing in north america ? 
  and of course [ pferdeleberk\u00e4ssemmel ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/leberk%c3%a4sesemmel.jpg ), 
   mineral water or `` soda ''  tap water i actually think , that `` still water '' in austria is kind of a scam . 
  you wo n't taste any difference to tap water and it 's just more expensive . 
  did somebody from austria already say germany ? 
  we used to be the best empire in europe but after two world wars we were left decimated and nowadays we 're ( population wise ) only about 1/10th of germany . 
  thats why we 're always so proud when we beat them in skiing or in international rankings ( e.g. 
  happiness index , quality of life index , most liveable city in the world , english skills , beer per capita , etc. ), 
  easy - never learned a single word of dutch .
