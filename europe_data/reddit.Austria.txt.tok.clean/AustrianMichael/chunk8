  is dutch even a real language ? 
   weird accent and that comes from people who say `` j\u00f6ggeli '' to table soccer . 
  or `` r\u00f6ssli '' to horse . 
  or `` t\u00fcpflischisser '' to a small minded person . 
  hitler not dying as a child . 
  4 of his 5 siblings did n't make it age past age 6 . 
  one died after 6 days , two at 2 years old and another one at 6 years old . 
  only he and his sister paula made it to adolescent . 
  i guess that would have been quite a significant change in world history . 
   due to being american ? 
  most likely no . 
  expect some stupid puns about your new president , but that 's about it . 
  also do n't be offended if a waiter or other service personal is not super super friendly . 
  austrians are very direct and come straight to the point and we wo n't ask you every 5 minutes if you want another drink or if everything is ok .  due to being black ? 
  well , unless you linger around certain subway stations in vienna you should be fine . 
  racial profiling is still a thing but it 's mostly limited to stations along the u6 line , so you should be fine . 
  if the police stops you just show them your passport and cooperate and you should be fine . 
   i do n't speak a 2nd language , will that be a problem ? 
  people under the age of ~ 35 are very likely to be able to hold a conversation in english . 
  elderly people not so much . 
  i think , that we 're more european . 
  there is obviously some influence from the us but it 's not so bad . 
  geizhals.at it 's really great to compare prices as well as features of tech articles . 
  i always found the search and the possibilities to filter on amazon bad and this site really improves on this a lot . 
  especially because you can compare product x with product y , something amazon ca n't do . 
  in my school you were able to choose between latin/spanish/french and italian in 7th grade . 
  in the 9th grade you had to choose an additional language . 
  but that was a recent change . 
  i was the last year that had to take latin in 7th and french in 9th grade . 
  hate ( d ) both languages and i would have preferred learning italian and especially spanish . 
  there was also an extra curriculum for russian and czech , but i do n't remember anyone who actually took one . 
  generally italian , spanish and french are the three languages that are mostly being taught . 
  maybe slovene in some parts of carinthia , but that 's more because of the slovene minority living there then the proximity to slovenia . 
  the ones you can buy in the supermarket are called tortilla chips but people still refer to them as nachos and not really as tortilla chips . 
  we do n't really have spanish/mexican cuisine in austria . 
  a few years back cinemas started selling tortilla chips as `` nachos '' and probably since then people keep referring to them as nachos . 
  [ nachos ] ( http://nachoking.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/nachos.jpg ) . 
  if the blade is less then 6cm they are allowed to be carried within the hand luggage . 
  [ something like this ] ( http://img.youtube.com/vi/shp8flnbnky/0.jpg ) is technically fine . 
  some places in the first district are also named after scotts , e.g. 
  apparently this is because of some irish and scottish missionary who worked in vienna the 11th or 12th century . 
  and in nearly every major austrian city there is a `` s\u00fcdtirolerplatz '' , named after south tyrol after we lost it to italy after the first world war . 
  we also have `` mexikoplatz '' , named in honour of mexico because they were the only country in the league of nations to protest the `` anschluss '' of austria to nazi-germany in 1938 . 
  austria can look quite different . 
  i grew up in salzkammergut , so everything looks a bit more alpine - [ basically it 's mountains with lakes in between ] ( http://www.ausswinkl.at/index_htm_files/3894.png ) . 
  * [ hallstatt ] ( http://www.dachstein-salzkammergut.com/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_hallstatt_c-stmg_f-ch._parzer_03_343d88ee5f.jpg ) is probably the most popular and well-known place in my area . 
  * [ traunsee ] ( https://www.geniesserhotels.com/media/img/800x450/0647_traunsee_panorama_blick_auf_den_zimmern_.jpg ) * [ wolfgangsee ] ( https://www.hotel-winzer.at/image/files-regionpanoramamiddle.jpg ) * [ gosausee ] ( http://dachstein.salzkammergut.at/uploads/pics/gosausee_10.jpg ), 
  mostly vans , like ford transit or vw lt/t5 or caddy . 
  for heavier stuff we have the '' ** uni ** versal ** mo ** tor ** g ** er\u00e4t , or short [ unimog form mercedes-benz ] ( http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/image/1492618/max/1920/1080/61ddabec372603ca3df13fd75222d38c/hr/unimog-schwarzenegger-merex-03.jpg ) ^ ( yes , that is arnold schwarzenegger ), 
   how would turkey take military action against the netherlands ? 
  not exactly military actions . 
  but there are 400,000 turks living in the netherlands . 
  even 1/10th of them can create quite a chaos if erdolf calls for them to defend their homeland or some bullshit . 
  i live in austria and i can confirm this . 
  czechs dying while diving in lake attersee , czechs dying while skiing , czechs dying while hiking/climbing . 
  happens all year round . 
  people in vienna still complain about it all the time . 
  even though we won the first place in the mercer study for seven consecutive years now . 
  and other studies usually rank vienna in the top 5 as well . 
   have terrible sales they still have waiting times of a few weeks in the usa . 
  and it is only available in australia , canada , germany , uk and the us . 
  germany . 
  swap them for a cool country like sweden or the netherlands . 
   specifically austrian german germans are expected to learn austrian german ... marmelade , marille , sackerl , erd\u00e4pfel , topfen , jause , apfelsaft gspritzt , spritzer , ... 
   somewhat well that 's a nice understatement . 
  people working at mcdonald 's speak better english then people teaching at universities here in austria . 
  [ muttertag ( 1993 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zg_mimfe_a ) is probably one of the most famous austrian films that is only known in austria . 
  furthermore , the movies based on books by wolf haas are quite well known : [ der knochenmann ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw9avdfy8o8 ) , [ komm , s\u00fc\u00dfer tod ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6_nzpjolnq ) , [ silentium ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0nemhd0d7a ) , [ das ewige leben ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnuyx6zyv8o ) . 
  rocknrolla was not that bad tbh . 
  [ that 's my earliest memory/trauma of learning english in school . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvzzihqb9vi ), 
  ok . that does sound cheaper than in vienna , but not by that much compared to how low the salary is . 
  milk and gas cost pretty much the same as in bulgaria it seems . 
  but living on 50 $ a month is straight up impossible here ... 
  how much does food and stuff cost in bulgaria ? 
  like a litre of milk , bread , meat , etc. 
  [ as long as you 're fine with carrying a rifle outside town at all times , you 're going to like it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch7hwhgynxk ),

  actually austrias `` 4th of july '' is on the 26th of october , the day we signed our [ declaration of neutrality ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_neutrality ) .

   is the sport broadcasted live yes , unless there is a ski race at the same time . 
  our national broadcaster orf is broadcasting it . 
   are the big names famous for the general population in their countries ? 
  people maybe know fourcade , but that 's about it . 
   are there significant regional differences in popularity within the country , like northern vs. southern italy ? 
  not really , but winter sports are not that popular in the area around vienna . 
   how would you rate the popularity of biathlon compared to other winter sports about the same as cross country skiing but not as popular as ski jumping and a lot less popular than alpine skiing . 
   he said to an austrian newspaper that he is more known in austria than in norway . 
  that 's probably true for every good skier right now . 
  in the us people reefer to her as `` tiger woods ex-girlfriend '' and not as the best female skier ever . 
  i 'm pretty sure that mikaela shiffrin can go pretty much unrecognised everywhere in the u.s. 
  ford transit . 
  the really long and really high version . 
  1,974 m wide , 6,474 m long and 2,636 m high . 
  should i change my facebook profile picture already ? 
  [ we basically invented `` trump-like movements '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_party_of_austria ) ^ ( and i 'm not even talking about that one guy ... ) recently , in the election for president of austria , we opted for the former green party leader van der bellen instead of the right-wing party candidate norbert hofer . 
  but still , the fp\u00d6 is expected to win or at least reach second place in the next general election and it is absolutely possible that they will be a part of the next administration of austria . 
   980 km that 's just like 4 hours on the autobahn :d, 
   fully automatic i 'm pretty sure , that you ca n't just buy fully automatic that easy .
