  it all started out as a meeting of a few golf gti - fans and it has become one of the biggest - if not actually the biggest - car meet in the world . 
  nowadays it 's not only gtis , but pretty much every brand of the volkswagen ag . 
  we did once spot two [ f117 nighthawk ] ( http://www.airpower.at/news02/1023_f-117a/ ) . 
  and actually managed to reach them with the mighty draken . 
   trans-national european streaming service well , there are already channels like arte ( french-german ) and 3sat ( switzerland , austria and germany ) .

  austrians definitely not . 
   monaco it 's actually quite nice . 
  a great day trip if you 're already on the c\u00f4te d'azur . 
  maybe try to avoid the time of the grand prix though , i 've heard that it get 's quite crowded at this time round . 
  roughly 80 % of payments in germany are done in cash . 
  the main reason for this is , that the struggle after two lost wars left a ... mark :d, 
   paper bills just do n't really feel like everyday money , and using them for such small denominations just is n't right . 
  personally , i would love to have 1 $ bills like they have in the us . 
  [ eugen freund ( mp from austria ) was so cringeworthy he was mentioned in last week tonight ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z49gp87ew0 ) [ here is the full link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qizr4yjnctc ), 
   well , but given how the us election and brexit turn out .

  [ remember the austrian presidential election in 2016 ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_presidential_election,_2016 ) right-wing candidate hofer won the first round and then lost the second round at first by ~ 30.000 votes and then at the second attempt by a quite substantial ~ 350.000 votes ( 6 % ) .

  [ g\u00fcnther oettinger ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88ogxlfpemw ) is probably the prime example for a bad german accent ... 
  every heard of the [ freedom party of austria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_party_of_austria ) . 
  their candidate norbert hofer had a real shot at becoming our next president last year and the party itself is currently polling at ~ 33 % whereas the social democratic party , sp\u00d6 , is only polling at ~ 27 % and the conservative \u00d6vp at ~ 20 % .

  we also have a [ `` empfangsbox '' ] ( https://www.post.at/privat_empfangen_empfangsbox.php ) , that is mounted in the entry of bigger houses . 
  the postman can leave a parcel in there and you get a piece of paper with an rfid-chip in your postbox and when you come home you can hold the piece of paper to open the box . 
  works great .
