which was connecting a few large population centers with large unpopulated areas in between if the route does not change chsr will have a draw area with a larger population than any corridor in europe . 
   hyperloop traded some of rail 's ( unused ) strengths in being able to drop people off along the route for the benefit of shorter express times . 
  i read the `` concept paper '' and in this and from that , it was neither clear how this was supposed to work or be viable . 
  investing into a company that looks sketchy at best is one way to waste money . 
  the connections munich-austria and n\u00fcrnberg-austria are ridiculously slow . 
  even the new line from munich to salzburg will only reach speeds of 160 km/h . 
  the three divers were ( links contain further information about each ) : * [ boris alexandrovitch baranov ] ( http://www.webcitation.org/6dhidyjbv ) ( 1940-2005 ) * [ valery bespalov ] ( http://www.webcitation.org/6dhjgchfo ) , tasked with managment of spent fuel rods at block 1 . 
  * [ alexei michailovich ananenko ] ( http://www.webcitation.org/6dhhllazu ) , currently holding a senior position at the ukrainian nuclear forum . 
  for a long time , they were listed on wikipedias [ list of deaths due to the chernobyl disaster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deaths_due_to_the_chernobyl_disaster ) . 
  in january , someone finally looked for them on a search engine . 
   the thing is , i have not seen any scientific evidence that people had to be sacrificed the theory is , that if the molten core had reached the water , it would have caused a thermic explosion that would have damaged block 3 and set free further radioactive material from block 4 . 
  according to the statistics , only half of the sexual crimes were commited by austrians . 
   maybe it 's time to start engaging certain problems it is too late for that . 
  public security is under threat in several areas of vienna and hardly a day goes by with reports about the newly arrived `` fachkr\u00e4fte '' beeing involved into criminal actions . 
  these are some reports from the last three days : * [ an afghan immigrant exposed his genitals and tried to steal a gun from the police officers that were catching him ] ( http://www.nachrichten.at/oberoesterreich/asylwerber-entriss-polizisten-die-waffe;art4,2213600 ) * [ two morrocans tried to commit a rape at the main station of salzburg and assaulted a witness who stopped them from doing so ] ( http://www.salzburg.com/nachrichten/salzburg/chronik/sn/artikel/sexueller-uebergriff-vor-salzburger-hauptbahnhof-opfer-fluechtete-193012/ ) * [ three afghan immigrants commited a rape right in the station hall of wien-praterstern ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000035503971/studentin-in-wien-von-drei-jugendlichen-vergewaltigt ) * [ an afghan immigrant tried to commit a rape in graz ] ( http://www.kleinezeitung.at/s/steiermark/graz/4973855/graz_20jaehrige-entkam-nur-knapp-vergewaltigung ) * [ an immigrant from algeria attacked two random persons with a machete in vienna ] ( http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2770413/ ), 
   yeah , lets take those polls . 
  those polls were made when  10 % of the electorate were undecided and before the last discussion between the candidates took place . 
  those polls could not predict that griss , hundstorfer , khol and would loose voters to the fp\u00d6 and that a large number of undecideds would make their decission with the afghan rape mobs in mind . 
  the last time the fp\u00d6 was involved in governements ended in economical disasters . 
  they did not improve a single thing but institutionalised a culture of corruption and nepotism . 
  do you understand the begriff `` nachwahlbefragung '' ? 
  if you weight the shares of voters for the shares of both categories , for some `` magical reason '' , the result of the election appears . 
  apparently , it is from post-election polls . 
  hofer is set to win the majority in 8 out of the 9 federal states . 
  van der bellen appears to win vienna with 33 % vs. 27 % . 
   he is generally seen as member of the more moderate wing `` moderate '' is relative within the context of this party . 
  as a member of parliament , hofer submitted a request in which he wanted to know if chemtrails were used in austria . 
  he is also a member of a students club which denies that austria is legitimate nation and calls for an annexation to germany . 
  i hope that van der bellen gets into the second round . 
  he would be better suited as a counterposition against the fp\u00d6 . 
  i am a bit sceptical of griss because she has been sponsored by several industrials and has a positive view of the last conservative-fp\u00d6-governement . 
  ** edit/question : ** why is my flair not showing up ? 
  ** first exit polls ** * hofer ( fp\u00d6 , right extremist ) : 36 % * van der bellen ( independent , former green ) : 19 % * griss ( independent , close to conservatives ) :18 %, 
   griess says it 's missing transparency - so she 's not opposed on signing it she voiced support for settlement courts as the were proposed by the commission, 
  `` unlucky '' is a very simmilar english word , although `` olycka '' appers to be a noun . 
  italy has less than 1/5 th of immigrants per capita than austria . 
  i by the way know from credible aources within the railways that italy issued their immigrants with train tickets to austria .

  100 people would be enough to disturb public order to a degree that it could not be restored with means of law enforcement and the legal system . 
  if those numbers are assumed to be typical , those people have enough ressources for guerilla warfare . 
  what is the bar called `` migration '' for ? 
  not the same : [ random swede ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/swede_-_rutabaga_-_veggiegroup.jpg ) and [ random swede ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4dlqoj/xpost_from_rtodayilearned_sweden_is_the_first/d1s7ni9 ) . 
  the whole situation is very unfortunate , but this `` indirect vote about something else '' is the consequence , if the democratic process is obscured for essential issues . 
  i would not be too surprised if this rocket launcher was originally supplied to the so called `` moderate rebells '' in syria . 
  such equipment may not even be available on the black market . 
  i am to some degree involved in wikipedia and therefore familiar with the legal situation . 
  to my knowledge , the removal of content is no requirement for the legal unaccountability of the wmf . 
  if this was the case , content would have to be removed every time someone threatens to sue against it . 
  there are also some court judgements which assert no accountability of the wikimedia foundation for the content , [ example ( german ) ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:lg_koeln_28_o_344-07.pdf ) . 
   i do n't understand how you get the notion that it 's not covered by law . 
  `` beihilfe zur volksverhetzung '' is punishable . 
  i am only familiar with the situation concerning wikipedia . 
  if a user writes something on wikipedia , wikipedia or its operator , the wikimedia foundation can not be held accountable for any crimes or right violations , that this user commits because it only operates the platform . 
  i assume that the situation is similar for facebook . 
  i meassured it on the map and its about 1.500 meters . 
  i do n't have the exact numbers for the tgv 2ng2 , but it must have been going at at least 200 kp/h when it derailed . 
  i tried to measure the curve radius on a map and it appears to be 1.500 meters . 
  this allows speeds of ~ 200 km/h . 
  my father , a retired train driver , has supplied me with [ this file in german language ] ( http://www.filedropper.com/f05v00linienfuehrunggleisenb50teil2 ) , that gives further details on calculating curve speed . 
  he also claims , that there are 30 km/h reserve before a train derails as the equation used for calculating the maximum speed gives the speed at which the steel tyre ( the even surface of the wheel ) lifts , but not the speed at which the flange rises over the rail . 
  the stopping distance for a train a 320 kp/h appear to be 3.900 meters . 
  if the train had only lost 1/3 of its speed when derailing , it must have started to brake a little over 1 km before the curve . 
  at that point , the curve should have been visible . 
  it appears , that the train controll system was not working or installed at all and that the driver did not look at the track kilometer number and did not realize that the high speed line was ending soon - which would be similar to the accident in santiago de compostella two years ago . 
  the accident happened at the beginning/end of a the lgv est ( [ link to the openstreetmap ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/48.6811/7.7002 ) ) . 
  the curve appears to have a radius of at least 1 km . 
  the train must have been at a very high speed . 
  if 42 out of 50 people survived this crash , it shows , that survival chances are good even at high speed crashes . 
  schmidt appeared to be one of the last former politicans who had an intellectual weight and could fullify a function in public discourse without an office . 
  there are no succesors with these attributes , half of the members of the last government are already forgotten . 
  according to recent results , clinton has just gotten a higher number of votes than trump . 
  this would be the fourth time , that a us presidential election is not won by the candidate with the highest number of votes . 
  votes are still counted in california , but according [ to bloomberg ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-election-results/ ) , clinton holds at 86,5 % of california beeing counted at 58,859,634 popular votes , while trump has 58,824,561 popular votes . 
  if current results do not change , the difference will grow to 357,946 votes or 0,3 % of the total vote . 
   in the first ten months of the year 153,000 arrivals even if all of them would have stayed in italy , this is still a low per-capita-rate compared to other states . 
  not a single mention of the `` moderate islamists '' firing mortars onto the routes out of east alleppo to prevent civilians from leaving ( [ source ] ( https://twitter.com/alextomo/status/789063775248932865 ) ) . 
  this is severely biased . 
   if its bad , ( ... ) ... then we do not have the option to exit as the german constitutional court criticized . 
  also , i have yet to see the benefits of isds and ceta as a whole that would make it worth to take the problems with both . 
  this summary is biased at best and avoids the issue with ttip and ceta . 
  isds did n't use to be about `` valid expectations for profit of investors '' , but rather about simple b2b-cases . 
  it was never the point of isds to control the economic effects of legislation . 
  originally , isds was in the context of states used i.e. 
  in trade treaties with the former eastern bloc to guarantee that legal principles such as the invulnerability of property would be honored . 
  as both canada and the eu have the most functional legal systems , it seems absurd to use a mechanism on them that was supposed to be used in states without a developed administration or a legal system . 
  appart from this , i.e. 
  the german constitutional court has criticized ceta for beeing intransparent and not allowing an exit in case that it does not work in its preliminary judgement on the matter . 
  it is not the case , that ceta would have gone into action if the wallonian local parliament had not vetoed it . 
  it was unpopular in several states and given the german constitutional court 's comments on it , it would probably not have passed a regular examination, 
  there are similar studies done on country level . 
  for austria , there was a 0,2 % economical benefit suggested by the associaction of industrials . 
   yes this shows a deep failure of the eu . 
  the failure was not the late escape from ceta , the failure was , that it even got to this phase despite all the wide-spread opposition . 
  this episode is the very example for the eu 's problem with democracy . 
  no , that was data from the last year . 
  `` brink of a civil war '' might be the wrong term . 
  it would be more accurate to say that there is a rapid eterioration of living quality public order in certain areas . 
  germany did not publish any data for this year , but in linz , the 3rd largest town in austria , criminality rose by 30 % in the first half of 2016 compared to the firat half of 2015 . 
  it is obviously not the people who commute in from surrounding villages who became more criminal .
