  the point is : when the axe-attacker from a few days ago yelled `` allahu akbar '' , it was soon reported by various witnesses on social media and several media outlets . 
  but in this case , there is no similar claim , and other reports make a religious motivation unlikely . 
  i find it unlikely , that he would have switched his motivation on the route from mcdonalds to the parking deck . 
  i have seen it myself and there is simply nothing that makes any similar statements . 
  i also doubt the authenticity of the claim , as lauretta is not a typical nname for muslims . 
  the story also does not fit together with the filmed appearanxes of the culprit , in which he complains about living in an area that was mostly populated with turks while not making any religious statements . 
  there are also other peoples claims about the culprit yelling anti-foreigner-paroles . 
  if his parents would have obtained german citizenship , they would have had to drop any other third-state citizenship . 
  it is also not possible to obtain another citizenship at a later point without having to give up german citizenship , so could not have simply taken an iranian citizenship at some point . 
   complaining about minorities in the video from the rooftop , he in fact complains about living in a poor area with lots of turks . 
  i stopped taking cnn seriously years ago . 
  there is no local source or even anyone on social media supporting this claim . 
  unless it is prooven otherwise , i am going to assume that 4chan called that news outlet . 
  according to receng news , an immigrant from iraq hid his bags in a train hnder dubious circumstances anf apparently made a threat . 
  he had dual citizenship btw . 
  in this scenario , it is likely , that one his paremts was german . 
  on a sidenote , the culprit had a dual citizenship . 
  in order for this to work , it seems somewhat likely , that one of his parents was german . 
  a lot of immigrants do n't have european citizenships . 
  there is also the video showing the culprit talking to people on another roof ( [ transcription ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich22july/comments/4u4f0g/video_of_people_offending_the_shooter_screaming/d5mqlhh ) ) . 
  the things he says ( claims of having been bullied and complaints about psychiatric treatment ) make it quite unlikely , that he was acting out of religious motivations . 
  nothing like this was mentioned in any german-speaking media or in the police press conference , so i tend to put this into doubt . 
  this is [ drachenlord ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6cws1gugwg ) , a locally famous internet weirdo . 
  there is a [ transcription ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/munich22july/comments/4u4f0g/video_of_people_offending_the_shooter_screaming/d5mqlhh ) . 
  it is not clear if this is in any way related , but people on various forums are posting that heavily armed police has taken position at the main station of st. p\u00f6lten , a town of 50.000 people 25 minutes by high-speed rail away from vienna . 
  the federal railways [ have announced ] ( http://fahrplan.oebb.at/bin/help.exe/dn?tpl=showmap_external ) , that the station has been closed following orders of the police . 
  * edit : * the station was closed due to a bomb threat , that was cleared within a short time . 
  erdogans plane has taken course on istanbul , where he will soon continue his wrongful deeds . 
  ( [ flightradar 24 ] ( https://www.flightradar24.com/thy8456/a5a3952 ) ), 
  [ according to the live ticker of `` die zeit '' ] ( http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2016-07/tuerkei-militaer-putsch-binali-yildirim ) , \u00dcmit d\u00fcndar , the commander of the 1st infantry division , which is based in istanbul declared its loyality to erdogan ( entry at 0:44 ) . 
  at least it appears , that daesh does not have access to explosives . 
  it appears , that the problem is deeply routed . 
  if it becomes the norm , that there is an attack every few months , something will have to be done against its causes , that will have to ignore claims of religious freedom . 
  this would require the manipulator to gain access to a necessary number of ballots , to prepare those ballots and to change these ballots within a rather short time . 
  if opening the envelopes took hours , it is unlikely , that exchanging the real ballots for the prepared ones would take even longer . 
  the manipulator in this case would not know , if he would either cause a result , that would be noticeably untypical or if he would actually cause a result that would be unfavorable compared to the unchanged result . 
  if the manipulator would only pick a part of the ballots , he could not be sure if his sample would be biased towards one candidate and if exchanging the ballots would noticeably lower the number of votes for his candidate . 
  such a manipulation would take more time than the electoral commitees had and the manipulator could not even be sure if it would actually work . 
  notice : the postal envelope contains a second envelope which contains the ballot . 
  the issue in question was the removal of the second envelope from the postal envelope and the marking of obviously invalid second envelopes ( i.e. 
  ones , that lack necessary data like a signature . 
  unless you have managed to counterfeit a sustainable number of ballots ( which are made out of a special type of paper ) and to include the whole district administration into your conspiracy - this is not a scenario , that is near to the life . 
  doing so does not make sense because you do n't know which vote is inside the ballot envelope . 
  the ballots and their envelopes were not opened . 
  the envelopes , which contain the envelopes of the ballots were opened before the counting of the votes began . 
  the possibilty of a fraud was never discussed or investigated . 
  the courts decissionwas based on the rationale , that two violations of the electiral laws ( local commitee members were not always present , the counting did not start at monday 9 am ) were formal failures . 
  a fornal failure was enough to void the election . 
  the court has not made a statement regarding the question if or how those iasues could have allowed any manipulations . 
  however , a votendoes nit change if it is counted earlier . 
  this evil labour leader on his chairman mao bicycle ... < / s , 
  the number of hospital , police and fire staff seems very low . 
   thalys to belgium and france , ices to switzerland and austria . 
  none of them use lines with appropriate speed limits . 
  [ this map ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:ice_network.png ) shows the problem . 
  there is a structural problem with rail infrastructure . 
  there have been very few improvements in the system . 
  while spain has created a completely new network for long and medium distance-travel , there have been few improvements in germany . 
  there is no functional high-speed rail link to any neighbouring country . 
  the car-centered german government has no plans to change this and is blocking any attempts to change this ( fehmarnbeltquerung , accessory line to the brenner base tunnel and munich-salzburg , etc. ), 
  regional traffic is similarly worse , as there have also not been any major improvements . 
  disclaimer : i know that this source is not optimal , but the other english reports about this issue were worse and sometimes too apologetic of this party . 
  immigration is the core of the problem . 
  austrian rental regulations were made under the same premises and in parts following the existing swedish regulations , which had a lot to do with the brandt-kreisky-palme axis . 
  rents rose significanttly in vienna , where 80 % of the immigrants settle . 
  in other towns , rents did not rise above the inflation rate . 
  the linked file is blocked here . 
  i doubt that these data went into the vote count . 
  the website is not a live interface of the tally system , it is fed seperately with the finished data . 
   i love seeing these hyperbolic comments as if austria was on the edge of total ruin getting the fp\u00d6 into any position where they can make decissions is a safe way . 
  they brought one federal state to the edge of bancrupcy and the last government they were involved in ended caught up in economical incompetence and corruption . 
  kern has worked well as the ceo of the federal railways . 
  the fp\u00d6 will certainly have an obmanndebatte . 
  if you compare hofer and strache , it is easy to see , that hofer is far more suited for the job as a party leader . 
  strache is barely able to make coherent statements . 
  hofer not only appears to be able to think before he speaks , he also appears a bit more civilised . 
  it was foreseeable , that faymann would not stand for a third election . 
  kern is far better suited and the optimal point to install him as the chancellor before the next elections was comming close anyways . 
  we were incredibly lucky . 
  people underestimate how bad the fp\u00d6 is . 
  it also appears , that we got quite a good president . 
  according to recent rumors , the shooter was a local skinhead . 
  it seems as if he used a semiautomatic weapon of unclear legality . 
  do you expect me to translate and list everything of the last years ? 
  * edit : * i will do so later in the evening . 
  in the meantime , i refer to [ this episode ] ( https://translate.google.at/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fderstandard.at%2f2000036666695%2frechtsextreme-entgleisung-auf-facebook-seite-der-fpoe-burgenland&amp;edit-text= ) , [ that article ] ( https://translate.google.at/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2foe1.orf.at%2fartikel%2f378025&amp;edit-text= ) and [ this episode ] ( https://translate.google.at/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fderstandard.at%2f2000028639383%2fsusanne-winter-von-der-fpoe-zur-wahrheitspresse&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  vice has articles of various quality . 
  however , the photo is there . 
   a lot more scrutiny is placed on the fpoe with regards to this than any other party . 
  i have yet the see the call to put someone in gas chambers on the facebook page of another party . 
   neither did the fpoe . 
  where did all the nazis go after they were allowed to vote again ? 
   but instead of making a broad sweep across the entirety of the party it would be a lot more reasonable to attack specifics and not just some association with nazis . 
  no other party has the problem of a siginificant number of right extremist functionaries and followers . 
  neither \u00d6vp nor sp\u00d6 had started a war or a genocide . 
   oevp and spoe have a terrible founding history as well and some of the things that parties stood for do not belong in present days . 
  \u00d6vp and sp\u00d6 did not start as a collecting party for former nazis . 
  judging from pictures of their final campaign event , their base is still [ right extremist ] ( http://www.vice.com/alps/read/norbert-hofer-abschlusskundgebung-hitlergruesse ) . 
   with one of the strongest economies in all of europe . 
  ridiculous nonsense .
