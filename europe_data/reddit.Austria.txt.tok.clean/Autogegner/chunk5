  any reason that could be given as a motivation for the government to conduct such an attack could also be used if such an attack was conducted in a planned manner . 
  southwards of the village in question , rebels tried to push into the city of hama two weeks ago . 
  taking homs would allow the rebels to reconnect to their areas between homs and hama . 
  if chemical warfare agents were deployed , it would make much more sense to do so in an area where they would be of use and allow ground troops to take areas cleared of enemies . 
  the insurgents on the other hand have much more reason to release toxic gas in an area held by them . 
  for months , they have been asking for military action of western troops against the government . 
  this time , they finally got it . 
  however , it 's not been the first time , the us supplied anti vehicle missiles to what they called the `` free syrian army '' and an air raid conducted by american aircraft against the government held town of deir-ez-zor that allowed daesh to advance only happend a few months ago . 
  there is no proof that links the syrian government to the release of chemical warefare agents . 
  an earlier release in ghota [ could not be linked ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=de&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dw.com%2fde%2fassads-giftgas%2fa-38326578 ) to any side . 
  there are few reasons for the government to bomb a village in a region , where there are no military canpaigns at the moment . 
  it would be a dangerous mistake to bomb al-nusra into power over this incident . 
  the mountain in the background is called [ hohe munde ] , it marks the point where the valley of the river inn starts to broaden . 
  the photo was taken on the first clear day after unusually heavy snowfalls in january . 
  the temperature at that time was -14 \u00b0 at the nearby train station of flaurling .

  an interesting place , although completely inacessible by public transport . 
  i planned to ascend to cerro lucero in the neighbouring natural reserve two years ago , but found , that the area is very hard to access . 
  unfortunately , this one is not getting replaced . 
  the flexity will replace the e-2 . 
  this is absurd . 
  even if etas general actions are taken into account , assasinating carrero-blanco was a legitimate murder of a tyrant . 
  there is btw . 
  a recommendable movie called `` operacion ogro '' about these events . 
  this is worrying . 
  the strong sauce appears to be a counterweight to the minced meat , ehich mornally has few taste compared to other kinds of meat . 
  it is a somewhat noticeable feature of swedish cuisine , that similar sauces and berries are used to contrast main ingredients , that seem to have evolved out of scarcity i.e. 
  minced meat and sausages . 
  this does absolutely not curb the impression , that turkey is using its emigrants as some sort of colonial influence . 
  within the last years , it has become apparent that there is a connection between the turkish state and various religious , political and pretending-to-be-apolitical groups in austria and germany . 
  this groups have been working on gaining influence in the political landscape of these countries , which has resulted in i.e. 
  extremist groups like the `` grey wolves '' subverting the social democratic party of linz , the third largest town of austria . 
  not once have groups like the turkish-funded mosque association atib or ditib shown any interest in working on a progressive society . 
  all they do is trying to broaden their influence and claim racism , when misuse of funds for islamic kindergardens is discovered . 
  there is nothing , that points towards turkey beeing interested in anything the we could agree on . 
  the lefts inability to react to this is , what fuels the right wing . 
  trolls act for personal entertainment and tend to limit their actions to some degree . 
  shills on the other side are compareble to the professional begging gangs , which roam public transport stations . 
  they know , that they wo n't achieve anything , but still disturb the flow of passing people to make anybody notice them by blocking ways and stairs . 
  in a similar way , those shills work on disturbing discussions by flooding them with whataboutisms and deflections . 
  when looking at the comments of those accounts , one notice that they mostly comment on things regarding right populist parties of various countries . 
  they never make any substatial arguments and seem to have no knowledge of the local situation or the subject of the discussion . 
  it is known to them , that they can not shift a discussion by rhethorical means . 
  therefore , they resent to disruptions , such as the `` political persecution '' - argument here . 
  did you take a look at the comment history of those accounts ? 
  they are obviously either trolls or shills . 
  it may have been better to leave them as they were , but without europe , those countries would not have advanced over the pre-medieval civilisation which they had before colonialisation . 
  this subject has already appeared at a demonstration of the right wing group pegida in graz in 2015 .

   when asked about another critic -- french jewish singer patrick bruel -- le pen said then that he would be part of `` a batch we will get next time , '' using the word `` fournee '' for `` batch '' , evoking the word `` four , '' which means `` oven .

  there seems to be a systematical problem with radical islamism in graz . 
  when wahabist villages in bosnia were sieged by law enforcement , many cars with number plates from graz were found . 
  if i remember correctly , graz had one of the higher numbers in daesh militants . 
  there is also the strange case of the car attack in 2015 . 
  a man killed three people and injured several others by driving through a pedestrian zone at high speed . 
  he looked instabile to some degree , but during his trial , it became know that he used to beat up costumers of his car dealing business with a person who was later convicted for recruting daesh militants and preparing their journey to syria . 
  a few days before the car attack , this person was secretly recorded saying that were `` preparing something '' . 
  as far as it is known to the public , there has never been a closer investigation if the daesh agent had instructed the attack driver . 
  it does not cause other than administrative costs to discontinue things as passporting . 
  but in general , the uk has been able to take the position as the main financial market place of the eu . 
  most eu countried i.e. 
  issued their bonds in london . 
  the london metal exchange has been the main exchange for ressources of the eu . 
  financial business to and from the eu will not stay in the uk . 
  it my be possible , that the uk gains better access to i.e. 
  india , but selling dubious investments to indian farmers while importing consumer goods from there i a strategy for mitigation , but not growth . 
  you apparently need to be explained basic terms : http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/pra/pages/authorisations/passporting/default.aspx, 
  apperently , this means that the financial industry will not retain its passporting rights and therefore not be able to access the european market from the eu . 
  what is supposed to be left of the uks economy if the financial industry leaves ? 
  shepherding and fishing ?

  an overview for the districts , which are in some cases identical with towns can be found on the pages 1-3 . 
   im on my way to the westbahnhof and even planning to buy two cheesburgers i did n't claim that you would not survive this . 
  but if you need to make this your standard , you should notice the problem with that . 
   aside from that you are partially looking at data of such small scale that it 's not event statistically significant . 
  for the cited case of linz , the difference is 2.700 from an original 7.900 crimes . 
  this is outside of the even carefull standard deviations . 
  for almost all urban regions , the differences are at least a few hundred cases . 
  i did not look closer at this , but it doubt that a test would give point towards the numbers beeing not significant . 
   so you can get odd effects when data appears after the fact . 
  the issue about this is that under this assumption there should be no correlation between any districts . 
  i did n't calculate any further into this , but i am sure that if looking at historical data , a correlation between the values for each district and the general trend can be found . 
  this means that if most districts report a rise in crime , there is a factor that causes a general rise in crime . 
  to assume that this obvious factor would not exist in q3 and q4 does n't seem plausible . 
   none of the moroccan people in austria will stay here or even get asylum . 
  the problem in innsbruck [ exists since years ] ( http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/4740045/innsbruck_oesterreichs-gefaehrlichster-bahnhof ) - it has been expanded by the recent influx . 
  the elements in question will not get deported as there are numerous groups and organisations working against any restriction of immigration . 
   rudolfsheim fuenfhaus is famous for the large foreigner population and being a bit rough about the edges . 
  until it was banned , there was a problem with prostitution and in part gambling . 
  but appart from this , the resulting crime concentrated on hotspots and mostly stayed within this milieu . 
  there was noticably more crime than in other areas , but from what i hear it has become more frequent in the last year . 
   crime does not distribute like that . 
  so your argument is that the quarters of the year are not comparable with those of previous years , because following your argument crime distributes completely randomly during the year ? 
  from the point of time series analysis , it makes more sense to assume a correlation between a development of a rate in consecutive time periods . 
  in this case : it is likely to assume that the crime rate will rise in q3 and q4 if it has risen in q1 and q2 . 
   i shared a flat with a girl and she never had any issues either . 
  accordings to the statics , there are few crimes in the areas far out and in the inner , wealthier districts . 
  but crime in the rest of the town crime has risen by up to 20 % .
