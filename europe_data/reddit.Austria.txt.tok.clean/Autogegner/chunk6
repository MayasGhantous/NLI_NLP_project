   vienna is still a safe city despite the influx of questionable individuals . 
  i used to live in the 15th district , near the crossing johnstra\u00dfe / h\u00fctteldorfer stra\u00dfe . 
  neither i nor any of my neighbours had a problem there at any time of the day . 
  but as i hear from my former neighbours , several , sometimes violent crimes have been commited against people walking home from the subway station . 
   chechens are with us for quite some time alread they at least kept the problems in the areas where they live , i.e. 
  favoritenstra\u00dfe . 
  the current problem does not focus on any certain areas . 
  there has been a general rise in violent crime . 
  in the town of linz , crime has risen by 1/3 , according to [ the statistics for the first six months ] ( https://www.parlament.gv.at/pakt/vhg/xxv/ab/ab_09375/imfname_557573.pdf ) of 2016 . 
   i was there 3 months ago for a week and it looked perfectly fine . 
  so you are a tourist from the united kingdom who probably stayed within the districts 2-9 . 
  unless you can proove frequent ridership of the subway line u6 , i do not think that you can claim expertise on this issue . 
  i used to attend the supermarket at the west station for its late opening hours . 
  there are gatherings of rather agressive groups which are seeking conflict . 
  the last time i was there , i saw someone swinging an iron bar in the station hall . 
  for me , random violence is the main criteria for a no go zone . 
  at no point could i see any of thouse who had been clapping at the arriving immigrants . 
  i presume that the too prefer not to be at this place anymore . 
  vienna used to be a mostly safe city . 
  one and a half year ago , there was no problem with going anywhere late at night . 
  the quality of living is decaying at an alarming speed . 
  the thought at how things will look in another year offers nothing positive . 
  i was in innsbruck on new years eve . 
  i had spent the day photographing trains and travelled back in the evening . 
  i arrived at the main station at 2:30 pm and went towards the river inn . 
  i had already noticed groups of immigrants on the train from the unterland to the town . 
  there had already been a noticeable decline regarding certain aspects in the area near the main station and most noticeable on museumstra\u00dfe towards the inner town . 
  there were certain groups noticeable and although i had gotten the same experience before , there was an unusually agressive climate emanating from them . 
  on the train back , i got to witness two members of this group two rows down from me . 
  when the train attendant came , they were asked to purchase a ticket but declined and told the train attendant they he `` could do nothing '' against them . 
  the two , which had been loudly singing before at least agreed to be brought to another part of the train and appeared surprisingly cooperative , they even showed the train attendent their moroccan passports . 
  incidents like the one described in this article are definately getting more frequent . 
  in the last year , there was a noticeable decline in public security , crime in the first half of 2016 rose by up to 1/3 in some towns . 
  the consequences of letting everyone in can not be overseen . 
  the west station of vienna , where illusionists had been clapping at the arriving immigrants has become a no go zone where crime and fights between mostly afghan and chechen gangs can be obserced several times a day . 
  despite those consequences , the inflow continues . 
  germany has controlls at the boarder to austria and sends back immigrants . 
  the eu commision has prohibited austria from doing the same at the boarder to italy . 
  they accumulate in innsbruck and are slowly adapting the city to their lifestyle . 
  today , i was searching for tendencially post-factual political discussions . 
  what i found on the linked subreddit exceeded my expectations . 
  i am linking this , because it is a striking demonstration of what right populism can do to the human mind . 
   err , than i have no clue what flag that is i saw it from the \u00c5ffnsteign today , it has some sort of standing bear at the top .

  the video appears to be blocked , [ here ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qosat6u4e-8 ) is a sufficient recording . 
  it is also blocked for austria . 
  had there not been the immigration of 2015 , hofer would not have gotten that far . 
  the problem has reached a size , where public security can not be guaranteed any more in certain areas of the major towns , i.e. 
  near the main station in innsbruck . 
  noone wanted to allow nearly unlimmited immigration and there is zero understanding for paying immigrants who had gone through the asylum procedure as much as someone who is unemployed or more than conscripts in the army or the civil service and most students have . 
  if we would not have had the problem of too much immigration , the fp\u00d6 would not have gotten into that position . 
  austria is structurally rather similar to denmark , had the immigration policies been similar , the political landscape would be quite similar . 
  the fp\u00d6 in its current form results mostly from j\u00f6rg haider , who had studied the american far-right , i.e. 
  newt gingrich in order to copy their platforms . 
  haider used them with moderate sucess , he was able to win his state elections mostly by draining from the social democrats and to some extent from the conservatives . 
  his new voters did n't care about him reintroducing antisemitism in austrian politics and probably did n't understand his neoliberal economic policies like the flat tax . 
  haider was able to make to rural population think of him as some sort of saviour . 
  his populist line appears to have been a cover up for nepotism and corruption . 
  while he was presenting himself as the great reformer who only could not realise his ideas for reforms which sometimes took a fascist language , his state carinthia suffered from an economic decline . 
  haider died in 2008 , when his car left the right edge of the road . 
  one year after haiders dead , the first members of his government were sentenced for coruption and embezzlement . 
  there are few of them left who are not convicted . 
  haider had left a toxic heritage to austria . 
  the formerly state owned bank hypo alpe adria was in danger of collapsing , which would had disastrous economical consequences . 
  the bank had to bailed out , the costs may rise up to 20 billion euros , 1/3 of an annual federal budget . 
  haider and the fp\u00d6 had left nothing sucessfull neither in carinthia , nor during their involvement in two consecutive federal governments . 
  everything the fp\u00d6 touched ended in a total failure . 
  as writer josef winkler said , haider was able to clear off with his ashes - numerous people were convicted because they broke the law with him . 
  but voters started to forget what they had caused just a few years after getting out power . 
  the fp\u00d6 , that had splitted after falling out of the government reunited soon after under a noticeably less intelligent chair . 
  this new chair , strache - his name derives from `` strach '' , the czech word for fear - was able to regain voters with primitive campaigns . 
  these campaigns were simply constructed , had simple messages and were mostly operating with fears . 
  a new soviet union arising from the eu ( `` eudssr '' ) quickly became their main issue . 
  the fp\u00d6 noticed , that they could dumb down their line and still gather votes . 
  they dropped every piece of decency and seriousity and started to operate with lies and insults . 
  there were rumors that trump was taking inspiration from the european far right back in spring . 
  the fp\u00d6 has been a main developer of that far right line and with trump , we appear to see the return of this political poision to the place from where it originated . 
  you need tk click on `` 2 . 
  wahlgang '' on the upper left side foe this round . 
   kickl is even worse tbh kickl studies philosophy since 50 semesters and just does n't get smarter . 
  van der bellen is clearly the better choice . 
  in order to explain , i copy a previous comment of mine : hofer ( the right wing candidate ) is by far the most disgusting person on the political stage . 
  never before has a campaign been operating with that kind of maliciousness , that hofer and his supporters have shown . 
  they had less arguments for themselfes than rumors about their opponent . 
  at first , they started spreading rumors about vdb suffering from chancer and dementia . 
  in the later phase of the campaign , they started calling vdb a nazi , a communist , a spy of the eastern block ( while always claiming that hofer had better relations to russia ) and a neoliberal . 
  this right-wing candidate made a point of telling lies and becomming outraged when beeing called out . 
  in an earlier debate , he claimed to have gotten into a terror attack while visiting the temple mountain in jerusalem during an official visit in the parliament of israel . 
  the tv station found out , that there was no official visit to the parliament and the police did not know anything about the attack hofer claimed to have witnessed . 
  he and his supporters later started a witchhunt against the presenter of that debate . 
  it later became known that while hofer was at the temple mountain , someone tried to climb over a barricade and was shot at by the police , but this was not identical to hofers description of an assault with granades and machine guns . 
  he was not near that , but he spun a story that should make him look like the heroic surviver of a terror attack . 
  a few weeks ago , he claimed that there were no muslimic nurses . 
  when beeing called out for that , he cited a masters thesis which prompted the author of that thesis to come forward and deny that her thesis offered any basis for that claim . 
  telling lies with a straight face is what hofers campaign is based on . 
  hofer tried to make himself look sympathetic , but he could not hide his choleric second face that became visible in the last debate when he started yelling `` lies '' when vdb started citing him . 
  there is a real danger that should he get into office , he would be confronted with foreign politicans and diplomats with different points of view . 
  if he should have a similar mental breakdown as in the last debate , he would fall into isolation and ridiculousness , taking austria as a hostage with him . 
  the really dangerous thing about hofer is , that he is working against the eu membership while claiming that he would priorize relations to russia and serbia . 
  both of these countries are economically unimportant to austria .
