confirmed : new german negotiation strategy -- sch\u00e4uble resigns , to be replaced by jar jar binks . 
  i feel so old now . 
  somehow i always assume everyone online to be my age or older . 
  jetzt schon = now already unzufrieden = discontented ( not `` unfriendly '' ) grad = gerade = just verbietung = verbot = ban killerspiele = killer games = brutal video games this comes up * every time * a violent crime happens in germany : it was brutal video games . 
  let 's ban them once and for all !, 
  austria-hungary used to have some [ uninhabited islands in the arctic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_josef_land ) . 
  well , they have n't had a war since they joined the eu . 
  for peace and prosperity , of course . 
  [ english source ] ( http://www.thelocal.at/20150709/slovakia-to-take-in-500-refugees-from-austria ), 
  it rained . 
  it was windy . 
  there was some hail . 
  end of story . 
  gambling is highly addictive and can potentially ruin people 's lives , in contrast to restaurants . 
  the idea that a private enterprise should profit from this is deeply amoral in my view . 
  i 'd rather have profit from gambling put into education than into private hands . 
  athens seems to be different . 
  i remember the only gas station where i got a 100 % correct receipt ( [ context ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3cizwp/holidaymakers_in_greece_ask_for_receipts/csw1gct ) ) was in athens . 
  and i was n't even on the islands , only on the mainland . 
  still better to have that money go to the state ( i.e. 
  society as a whole ) than into a private company 's hands . 
  people are going to gamble anyway , so at least use the money from gambling for a good purpose . 
  apparently it 's not measured precisely enough , or ( more likely ) auditing is lax . 
  also check if the amount on the receipt is the amount you actually paid . 
  i did a two-week road trip through greece in 2010 and i often got printed receipts with a much lower amount on them than i actually paid ( e.g. 
  filling up at a gas station for ~ 30 euros and getting a receipt with 5.00 euros printed on it ) . 
  `` the cheapest form of pride however is national pride . 
  for it betrays in the one thus afflicted the lack of individual qualities of which he could be proud , while he would not otherwise reach for what he shares with so many millions . 
  he who possesses significant personal merits will rather recognise the defects of his own nation , as he has them constantly before his eyes , most clearly . 
  but that poor beggar who has nothing in the world of which he can be proud , latches onto the last means of being proud , the nation to which he belongs to . 
  thus he recovers and is now in gratitude ready to defend with hands and feet all errors and follies which are its own . '', 
  strache to the rescue !, 
  the eu is more than the eurozone . 
  the euro has worked well for some and not so well for others . 
  i do n't see any problem with one of the latter countries leaving . 
  is intelligent design considered creationism ? 
  as far as i know it 's simply the belief that some kind of higher force intervened here and there in the process of evolution ( and possible set up our universe in such a way that it would be able to support life ) . 
  it does n't deny that evolution happens , that the earth is billions of years old etc. 
  so you have extended the [ dilbert principle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dilbert_principle ) to politics ? 
  apart from that , austria and new zealand have a very similar landscape . 
  new zealanders would fit right into europe . 
  they even have alps !, 
  also , austria is often called `` island of the blessed '' . 
  it would be fitting if we ended up on an actual island . 
  i think most austrians would actually like it . 
  we 've been in the center of a tumultous continent for too long . 
  finally , solitude !, 
  edit : there 's also the story that austria and new zealand are antipodes on the globe and vienna lies exactly opposite to auckland . 
  unfortunately that 's an urban legend ( we 're not exact antipodes , only somewhat close ) , but it 's still a popular notion when austrians think about new zealand . 
  i 'm cool with that . 
  they deserved it . 
  would it ? 
  it could also turn out well for both sides in the long run . 
  reintroducing the drachma would allow greece to become more attractive to tourists ( their main income source ) and allow the eurozone to move on . 
  the euro is not a fetish that needs to be upheld at all costs and in any situation . 
  it worked well for some countries and not so well for others . 
  the eu is more than the euro . 
  i 'd replace austria with new zealand . 
  that would be fun on so many levels . 
  i do n't know how it 's in turkey , but in austria for example you may only earn a certain amount ( ~ 400 euros ) in addition to your pension if you retired early . 
  if you exceed that , you wo n't get your pension any more until you drop below that amount . 
  this restriction stays in place until you reach the regular retirement age ( after that , you are free to earn as much money in addition to your pension as you want/can ) . 
  so you have to be very careful with extra income as an early retiree . 
  we were not so fond of our royal family after world war i. 
  in fact , we confiscated all of their property , abolished their titles and rights , threw them out of the country and banned them from entering again for a long time . 
   when i was in high school , my friends father `` retired '' at 48 and just gave the bank card to his son because he did n't need the money since he was still working . 
  how was he able to retire if he continued working ? 
  or did he switch to the shadow economy after retiring ? 
  but ... but ... [ i thought only americans were helping !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c49q6/american_volunteers_are_coming_to_greece_and/ ), 
  wow . 
  that 's more than austria 's ~ 62 % . 
  i always assumed we had the highest percentage of early retirement in europe . 
   unlikely . 
  well , no one predicted the rise of the fp\u00d6 under j\u00f6rg haider either . 
  but right-wing populism `` done right '' seems to have a huge appeal to voters fed up with the `` old parties '' . 
  i would n't be surprised if frauke petry transformed the afd into a german fp\u00d6 . 
  or it 's the start of its rise . 
  the whole situation with lucke and petry is starkly reminiscent of the [ fp\u00d6 in 1986 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fp\u00d6#profilierung_unter_j.c3.b6rg_haider ) , when the liberal leader steger was ousted in favour of j\u00f6rg haider . 
  i 'm afraid you 're wrong . 
  [ music is considered tangible ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tangibility ) . 
  but i do n't think this discussion has much merit . 
  we 've now reached the level of splitting hairs . 
  please let 's keep it at splitting the economy . 
  while i did take economy classes in university , i 'm not an economist . 
  i do n't have any arguments to justify the splitting of real economy and monetary economy . 
  i just assume the economy journalists and the economists they interview do have arguments -- after all , they talk about that distinction all the time . 
   humans want all kinds of things , ice creams , to listen to music , go on holiday , play computer games , travel , undergo therapy , dance in night clubs , read newspapers , have bank accounts etc etc. 
  except for bank accounts these are all tangible things . 
  and money ( e.g. 
  in a bank account ) is just a means to getting these things . 
  in the end , it 's all about the things ^ tm . 
   the point is : what we really need to live and enjoy life are the tangible things and services ( this includes listening to music and getting your hair cut ) . 
  money , or in a wider sense the whole banking sector , is just a tool to facilitate the production and distribution of goods and services . 
  it 's not an end in itself . 
  the great depression originated in the banking sector . 
  there was no war , energy crisis or any other external shock . 
  same for the global financial crisis ( although there 's the theory that the rising oil price might have played a role ) . 
  i do n't know what you 're missing . 
  the terms real economy and monetary economy are really commonplace .
