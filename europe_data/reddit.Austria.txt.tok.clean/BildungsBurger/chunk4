  being surrounded by friendly states is sufficient really . 
  that 's why it 's important to have good relations with one 's neighbors , whether you 're a homeowner or a nation . 
  it pays off in the long run . 
  one common argument against a professional volunteer military is that , if general conscription was to be abolished , only those with certain political leanings would join the military . 
  the military could then be used as a political tool , e.g. 
  for a military coup . 
  if soldiers come from all walks of life and all political groups , as is the case in a conscription army , then using the army as a political tool is not possible . 
  we had a referendum on a volunteer army in 2013 where this argument played an important role . 
  the majority voted against switching to a volunteer model and for keeping conscription . 
  kind of , i guess . 
  still , nothing can beat not being in nato and still spending whatever you want . 
  i 'm actually austrian . 
   but i 've lived in germany for a few years ( still visit often ) and noticed that card payment is even less common there , i.e. 
  less people pay with card and less businesses accept card payment than in austria . 
  i remember when i tried to buy a stereo at saturn germany ( a large electronics store chain ) and found out they did n't accept credit card payment , whereas saturn austria did . 
  good thing then we 're neutral and not in nato . 
  saves us quite a bit of money . 
  1.4 % of gdp , to be exact . 
   my bank does in fact know how the money is used . 
  mine does n't , because i pay in cash . 
    you can enter your card while goods are being scanned . 
  never seen that here . 
  the cashier has to manually enable the card reader first . 
  after all goods are scanned , the cashier waits for you to hand him the money . 
  you can now say `` bankomat '' or `` karte '' and he will press a key on his keyboard that activates the terminal ( which itself may take a few seconds ) . 
  then you can enter the card into the terminal . 
   seriously , people who use cash here are just stalling the queues . 
  here it 's the other way round from my experience . 
  it takes longer to pay via card . 
  businesses also prefer if you pay in cash ; some will have minimum purchase amounts ( like five or ten euros ) for card payments . 
  why ? 
  because banks charge them extra for card payments ( 3 % of purchase price plus 20 cents per transaction , if i remember correctly ) . 
  many small shops also do n't accept cards at all , especially in the countryside . 
  but you 'll find an atm in almost every small village and in the entrance area of many supermarkets , as well as in malls , at street corners etc. 
  they work 24/7 and you can use all of them , no matter which bank they belong to , in the whole eurozone , without any fees . 
   i guess this also means nobody there is using self-service payment automats ? 
  they 're great when you do not want to stand in line . 
  i 've seen something similar at ikea , but the last few times i was there they were closed . 
  apparently they did n't work as well as intended ( we certainly had problems when we tried to use one and had to go to a regular cashier 's desk ) . 
  tl ; dr i 'm no fan of card payment and certainly do n't want it forced on me . 
   using any kind of payment card will do the same . 
  banks also profile you through your bank account use , which is all handled digitally , today , including atm withdrawals using cards ? 
  yes , but the bank does n't know how the money is used . 
  they know that i withdraw a few hundred euros at the beginning of every month , but not where i spend them . 
  payment with card is a hassle most of the time , so most people reserve it for large purchases , like a new tv or computer . 
  for everything else , i and most people i know use cash . 
  it 's faster , anonymous and does n't need a network connection that is often annoyingly slow and sometimes does n't work at all ( i see signs like `` no card payment due to technical problems '' every other week at my supermarket ) . 
  even if it works , i still have to insert my card , wait ten seconds until it 's been read and verified , enter the pin code , wait another five seconds , confirm the amount and wait another ten seconds until the device allows me to remove my card . 
  using cash is simply faster and easier . 
  most people know the concept , but celebrating one 's name day is uncommon , or at least i 've never heard of it . 
  yes , but that difference is invisible because you never think about it . 
  also , it does n't help much when you have to decide whether to use `` quick '' or `` quickly '' when talking in english . 
  you simply do n't have time to mentally translate the sentence into german and see if you could declinate the adjective or not . 
   the only way is get the feel of it through reading and listening a lot . 
  the adjective/adverb thing . 
  in german there 's no difference . 
  we 'd say `` a quick visit '' and `` i visited them quick '' . 
  learning when to use quick and when to use quickly was very challenging . 
  it just does n't come naturally for native german speakers . 
  also , the spelling . 
  german is spelled phonetically , english is not . 
  i got about half of them right , mainly because i 've been to most of the countries ( scandinavia , iceland , faroese ) . 
  i did n't get the dialects right . 
  also , i understood luxembourgish perfectly , but did n't know that it was luxembourgish . 
  it reminded me of some german dialect ( mosel area ? 
  according to der standard 's live feed , it is . 
  there 's also a shoe dangling from the underside of the car .

  edit 3 : an [ updated map ] ( https://images.derstandard.at/t/lb109/livebericht/2000017771991/e90193e9-121a-4351-9ae3-369fb6fee036.jpg ) has been posted in der standard 's live stream . 
  translation of the legend : ( 1 ) 12:15 , the rampage begins , first person killed ( 2 ) perpetrator stopped and attacked passers-by with a knife ( 3 ) perpetrator drove on , hit two cyclists ( 4 ) driving with high speed through herrengasse , a pedestrian area with many shops and street caf\u00e9s ; two dead and many injured ( 5 ) perpetrator stopped in front of police station in schmiedgasse and voluntarily surrendered to police, 
  yes . 
  according to preliminary information by the police he went into a psychosis after being expulsed for domestic violence . 
  no religious or fanatical background so far . 
  indeed , according to kleine zeitung 's live feed , he 's a 26-year-old austrian with bosnian roots . 
  kleine zeitung is generally a reputable newspaper . 
  still , this does n't say anything about his motive at all . 
  he could be just mentally ill . 
  the man drove through pedestrian zones full of people ( saturday afternoon shopping ) in graz , austria 's second largest city . 
  according to eyewitness accounts -- among them the mayor of graz , who was riding his vespa and drove to the sidewalk when he saw the car approaching in the rear view mirror -- he went as fast as 100 to 150 km/h and deliberately ran over dozens of people . 
  so far , three are confirmed dead according to media reports , with 50 people seriously injured .
