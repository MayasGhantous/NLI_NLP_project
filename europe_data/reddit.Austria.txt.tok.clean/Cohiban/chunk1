same here btw . 
  now in exile , though . 
  in the city best known for music , cake and horses . 
  yay . 
  uni/work : windows 7 home : mac os, 
  well , people here were mildly upset/confused , when winners and losers of the war gathered in sarajevo to remember those that died and only the serbian delegation did n't attend , since they had to unveil a princip memorial somewhere in rs . 
  apparently , serbian politicians still feel the need to play the blame game at every opportunity . 
  and no one else was interested in participating . 
  well , this attitude from my side stems from the time of the 100 year anniversary . 
  lots of whining from the serbian side , lots of anger directed towards us , no sign for reconciliation from your side . 
  instead : nationalism , meetings in bosnia/rs , yadda , yadda , yadda . 
  i gave up to understand this attitude . 
  i 'm not mad at serbia , i do n't question their ( international or internal ) politics . 
  heck , i 'm even happy that my government still supports the idea of your country joining the eu one day . 
  why ? 
  because obviously it 's good for business . 
  please , carry on with your accusations and blind nationalism . 
  perfectly fine . 
  it does n't bring you anywhere , though . 
  i could have entered a huge discussion about who started wwi . 
  truth is : it was a gigantic clusterfuck from every side . 
  that 's why i chose to just write something along the line of : whatever . 
  let the serbians talk . 
  apparently it 's good for business . 
  it does n't really bother me and apparently it 's a huge deal in serbia . 
  whatever . 
  does n't matter as long as we can take advantage of them now ... 
  never !, 
  nope . 
  they usually just stick together and do n't bother anyone . 
  the negative stereotypes are directly aimed towards the viennese . 
  but after living here for 6 years now ... 
  it 's not as bad as everyone said . 
  vienna and carinthia are the weird ones . 
  also , you just confirmed that germans would n't recognize a humorous statement even when their lifes depended on it . 
  pretty much that . 
  not surprised by zeman 's `` speech '' , though . 
  probably drunk as shit ? 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  apparently , 16 % of all people living here have an immigration background . 
  and there are two ways to deal with that : we could leave the eu and lose all the benefits of the membership or suck it up , deal with it and make the best out of it . 
  switzerland chose option a ( kinda ... ) , the uk will probably do the same . 
  but why should we give them all the goodies anyway ? 
  so , apparently they have a problem with the eu and want to get rid of the bilaterals . 
  which would not only end eu migration , but would also lead to taxes on financial transactions , etc. 
  they ca n't just get the benefits of a deal and offer nothing in return . 
  sure , and it 's perfectly reasonable for the eu to tax financial transactions in/out of switzerland until the borders are open again . 
  sure , but you 'll be treated like other friends of ours . 
  like albania or macedonia . 
   leaving the eu is not the same as leaving erasmus . 
  considering that this divorce certainly wo n't be a nice one and keeping in mind what had happened to switzerland after their referendum , i 'd probably hurry with my erasmus semester in the uk . 
  well , not sure about the current state of your army , but a declaration of war from our side would n't be a huge threat against any nation ... 
  looks a lot like some regions in china . 
  even with that cheesy tiger art pieces . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  i waited for the old ~ ~ latvia ~ ~ austria joke . 
  to be fair , that 's in saalbach . 
  mhm ... 
  i always feel like 90 % of schweizerhaus ' customers are tourists . 
  still butthurt ? 
  fail . 
  this . 
  http://imgur.com/a562jh4 albania , moldova , kosovo , macedonia : literally no opinion . 
  uk : ni seems to be the weirdo out of the bunch . 
  no opinion about wales . 
  i love england and scotland , though . 
  hungary : i love that country , but their politicians are behaving like lunatics at the moment . 
  germany/switzerland : love/hate relationship going on here . 
  some people there are just weird and not very polite when they figure that you speak german , but not from their respective country . 
  russia : i really want to like their country , but considering what is going on there ... 
  customary international law ? 
  `` perchten '' are well known in western austria and come in different forms and colours . 
  there are some festivals in winter where people dress up like them . 
  here are the most popular characters : [ schiachperchten ] ( http://perchtenverein-goldegg.members.cablelink.at/schiachpercht_01.jpg ) [ h\u00e5bergoas ] ( http://perchtenverein-goldegg.members.cablelink.at/habergoas.jpg ) [ sch\u00f6nperchten ] ( http://mint.sbg.ac.at:8000/pics/2008/fasching%20in%20innsbruck/014_sch\u00f6nperchten.high.jpg ) [ here are some more ] ( http://perchtenverein-goldegg.members.cablelink.at/figuren.htm ) scariest shit i 've ever seen when i was young : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_y_sdv_hug, 
  well , tyrol has innsbruck , which is full of young and open-minded people . 
  something carinthia clearly does n't have . 
  [ chances are that that 's actually a thing . 
  ] ( http://images.fxcuisine.com/blogimages/scotland/deep-fried-pizza/scottish-deep-fried-pizza-03-1000.jpg ), 
  [ i have to agree . 
  also amongst my favourites .

  never had that in my life , but god ... that looks delicious . 
  that 's the country where they serve their schnitzels with j\u00e4gersauce , right ? 
  i said that the dish is not my favourite and not that i want to burn in hell for eternity ... 
  while i enjoy a schnitzel every now and then , it really is just a breaded slab of veal/pork / ... 
  there are more exciting things out there . 
  [ schweinsbraten with kraut and dumplings ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t0xpyg20yna/tucaqeult6i/aaaaaaaadqo/c5jty4q65hy/s1600/img_0411.jpg ) that and most hungarian inspired dishes . 
  single best ingredient : pumpkin seed oil . 
  nectar of the gods . 
  everything tastes better with a few drops of that oil on it . 
  soups , salads , even vanilla ice cream . 
  there really is n't a place in austria that 's as religious as the american south . 
  carinthia rivals them in conservativeness and general backwardness , though . 
  it 's funny because the one that probably has to put pressure on serbia , the new commissioner for european neighbourhood policy and enlargement negotiations , is from one of those eu countries that are most interested in south stream ... 
  prepare for some `` tough '' negotiations from his side . 
  prater is ~ 600ha and v\u00e1rosliget ~ 120ha . 
  and neither of those two is the biggest european city park . 
  i somehow doubt that it 's the biggest city park in central europe . 
  both prater and v\u00e1rosliget are bigger and i guess those are not the only ones . 
  a nice park nevertheless .
