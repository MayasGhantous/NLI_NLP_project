  the principles set in the eea agreement are only applicable to members of the eu and efta ( edit : sans switzerland , of course ) . 
  see : http://www.efta.int/media/documents/legal-texts/eea/the-eea-agreement/main%20text%20of%20the%20agreement/eeaagreement.pdf, 
   the biggest effect of a brexit would be on other pro-secession groups within the eu : they 'll get a bit louder in the immediate aftermath especially if the uk 's exit results in any perception of short-term economic gain or they 'll be dealt a popularity blow if the uk 's exit results in any perception of short-term economic pain . 
  that 's why i 'm pretty sure that it wo n't be easy for the uk to join the free trade area . 
  would be the wrong signal for the secessionists . 
  fear the ard !, 
  i would n't call our far-right conservative . 
  they are far from it . 
  seen some at westbahnhof , but no chance for interaction in vienna or linz . 
  there are simply non on the street . 
   do n't give me that crap , as if eu countries would n't invade serbia the moment it withdrew from the eu path . 
  this time we will kick your ass . 
  for realz . 
  sorry , but it 's a vast exaggeration to claim that the tories are the most pro-european in the uk . 
  as you said : the vast majority backs a half-assed campaign to keep the country in the eu . 
  and that 's already stretching it . 
  a very loud minority tries to push your country out , though . 
  so yeah . 
  more pro-european than widely believed ? 
  probably yeah . 
  the most pro-european party in the uk ? 
  you have to be kidding . 
   the conservatives ** are ** , and have always been , the pro european party . 
  you actually believe that ? 
   lord blackwell , a ** former adviser to john major and margaret thatcher ** , said that he does not believe that remaining in the eu without a `` significant change in the current arrangements is ultimately sustainable '' . 
  a staunch tory publicly supporting brexit ? 
  quelle surprise . 
  no one likes cherrypickers . 
  well , the comments on youtube are basically like those on / r/europe ( an ) . 
  huh ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directive_ ( european_union ) #legal _ effect, 
  it was because ferdinand i of habsburg was married to anne of bohemia and hungary , who was the daughter of vladislaus ii of hungary , the second to last king of hungary of the jagiellon dynasty . 
  ferdinand i , as the husband of anne , took over after louis of hungary died without sons , as it was laid out in a treaty between the house of habsburg and the house of jagiellon . 
  he subsequently was elected king of hungary in bratislava . 
  that claim was ( in the end unsuccessfully ) challenged by john z\u00e1polya , who got elected king of hungary in tokaj and sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r . 
  after a couple of lost battles he fled the country and asked the ottoman empire for help . 
  the rest is history . 
   claiming austria was a victim is utter bullshit . 
  no one is actually claiming that . 
  the whole article is a non-story . 
  yes , there was a referendum , but it was rigged . 
  then again , i 'm pretty sure the majority supported the anschluss , but there is no way 99.73 % voted yes . 
   we are basically part of them anyways , at least politically . 
  what ? 
  shameful ? 
  yup . 
  thing is , once the fp\u00d6 is in office they usually screw up big times . 
  they never performed well two times in a row . 
  frankly , strache 's fp\u00d6 is quite a bit more right-wing/populist than haider 's bz\u00d6 ever was . 
  and that 's quite telling . 
  considering that public opinion on cases like this is mostly formed by tabloids and not by the actual case file , including psych evaluations and hearing transcripts , i 'm not surprised that this still gets debated a lot . 
  do n't really get the downvotes . 
  did anyone actually read the article of krone and the many turkish news outlets that reported on the decision of the constitutional court ? 
  well , yeah . 
  the krone is one of the worst tabloids we have in austria . 
  this is not about age of consent . 
  multiple turkish newspapers reported the same story . 
  guess the responsible journalists just get imprisoned now ? 
  not an expert on turkish law , but seems like kronenzeitung was referring to this bit :  article 103 regulates any kind of sexual activity with minors under 15 ( or minors under 18 who lack the ability to understand the legal meanings and consequences of such actions ) as child sexual abuse . 
  according to the article , the turkish constitutional court got rid of this law now . 
  [ hurriyet ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkeys-constitutional-court-stirs-outrage-by-annulling-child-sex-abuse-clause.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=101607&amp;newscatid=509 ) reported the same , by the way . 
  seems like it 's a news display that randomly shows headlines from kronenzeitung . 
  the headline that was displayed is [ this one . 
  the airport was n't responsible for that and the display was not put up to taunt turkey ... 
  i somehow doubt that that was put up by the airport ? 
  any additional sources ? 
  i could only find something on turkishpress.de , but the webpage does n't seem to work right now . 
  the eu promised to speed up talks and open new chapters within the membership negotiations . 
  kurz said he would veto that . 
  [ link ] ( http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/5064770/erdoganchefberater-twittert-an-kern_verpiss-dich ) for anyone interested . 
  frankly , i think they might actually do this . 
  we have presidential elections soon and the major parties are trying to avoid a power shift towards the fp\u00d6 . 
  i do n't get it . 
  in essence , hungary tries to show that hungarians are against mandatory quotas ? 
  but would n't they be fucked , if the rest decides to apply dublin more strictly ? 
  economically neo-liberal ? 
  good joke . 
  besides , the idea of them being far-right is mostly fueled by themselves and by those many `` isolated incidents '' of showing far-right tendencies or outright german-nationalism . 
  if they want to be taken seriously they should work on their member-base and not only on their highly theoretical party programme . 
  the wto will give a fuck when your membership rights get suspended because of your actions . 
  since `` substantially all trade '' would n't be covered by the treaties anymore , the exception in art xxiv gatt would n't be applicable anymore . 
  other countries ( read : your competitors ) might impose punitive tariffs in case your country decides to unilaterally maintain lower tariffs for eu member states . 
  applying 0 tariffs only to eu member states without being a member state would lead to dispute settlement since it 's discriminating other wto members . 
  art xxiv would not apply anymore . 
  yes , it is worrying that some procedural rules were ignoring in a handful of regions . 
  but the fp\u00d6 wo n't be able to prove that this changed the outcome of the elections . 
  as for der standard making fun of fp\u00d6 witnesses : it was well deserved according to friends that attended the hearing . 
  yeah , but they still have to establish that the opening of the wahlkarten or them starting two hours too early had an impact on the result . 
  i do n't think that the fp\u00d6 was able to do that so far . 
  well , feel free to read the protocols on derstandard.at . 
  there is no evidence that there was manipulation , every fp\u00d6 witness so far confirmed that there was no fraud . 
  what they found , though , is that some procedural rules were partly ignored . 
  it 's pretty clear that they did n't change the outcome of the election . 
  fp\u00d6 ca n't provide evidence for that and all their witnesses say that everything has been fine . 
  except those staring lefties from the other parties . 
  highly suspicious . 
  at first i was a bit worried , but after the first couple of public hearings i 'm fairly confident that the election wo n't be declared void ... 
  considering the very weak witness-reports of the fp\u00d6 election witnesses , i think it 's more likely that some of them will land in prison or have to pay fines . 
  the public hearing has been a farce so far . 
  the absolute highlight was when one fp\u00d6 election witness said that he 's absolutely positive that there was no fraud , but he could n't help but notice that the witnesses of the other parties looked at him in a funny way .
