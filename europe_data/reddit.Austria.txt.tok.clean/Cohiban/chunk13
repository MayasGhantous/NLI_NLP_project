  i do not mind tourists speaking english at all . 
  i also do n't expect them to first ask me in german whether i speak english . 
  mid - to late 90s . 
  italy and croatia . 
  can not remember with whom we interacted , but i remember a few austrian and german kids . 
  i 'd add wiener zeitung and salzburger nachrichten for daily newspapers . 
  it 's still used in more conservative settings in austria . 
  for instance , really fancy coffee houses in vienna . 
  what exactly are you looking for ? 
  banking law is a pretty broad field and it would help if you could narrow down the scope a bit . 
  also , what do you mean with legal diplomas ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q01mqubqsdm ) is still pretty legendary . 
  seems like my old elementary school teacher did n't bother to teach the new version . 
  actually , towns can choose to establish their own gemeindewachk\u00f6rper that have the exact same duties as the bundespolizei but restricted to their respective town limits ( \u00a7 9 abs 3 spg ) . 
  not a lot of towns do so since it costs quite a bit of money to maintain a gemeindewachk\u00f6rper . 
  the more prominent example would be the stadtpolizei baden which is one of the few ( maybe even the only one ) that sports [ different uniforms ] ( http://www.siz.cc/tools/galerie.php?width=800&amp;height=600&amp;image=090305-sbig-07.jpg ) . 
  i am familiar with the basics of freemasonry , its history and the most common controversies . 
  freemasonry in austria is fairly transparent , but not a huge thing . 
  personally , i think of it as another rotary club . 
  a networking organisation with some quirky traditions . 
  in official court documents we 'd write `` eur 7.000 , -- '' or `` eur 7.000,99 '' . 
  that said , in real life 2,50 $ is certainly more common . 
  the [ most popular fields of study in 2016 ] ( http://www.vol.at/die-beliebtesten-studienrichtungen-in-oesterreich/5122197 ) were in order : * law * business and economics * education * psychology * biology * computer sciences * medicine * architecture * sociology * communication * english * politics * german * translations studies * history * chemistry * pharmaceutical sciences i combined various legal and business programmes that are listed under different names , but are essentially the same . 
  to be honest , i think that most major beer brands in austria taste pretty similar . 
  that 's the reason why i usually go for the more local brand . 
  zipfer or eggenberger when visiting my parents , ottakringer in vienna , puntigamer or g\u00f6sser when visiting family and friends in styria . 
  the occasional stiegl from the supermarket . 
  while not super popular or mainstream , you can occasionally find `` piroggen '' at restaurants specialising in `` alt-\u00f6sterreichische k\u00fcche '' . 
  watch out for daily specials , since they are a bit of a pain in the ass to make . 
  in case you are in vienna from time to time , i think [ `` die au '' ] ( https://www.yelp.at/biz/die-au-wien ) at augarten has them permanently on their menu . 
  the pirohy in bratislava were served with a sour cream/bryndza cheese mixture and bacon . 
  [ like so . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pierogi#/media/file:bryndzov\u00e9_pirohy_\u30d4\u30ed\u30d2\u30fc.jpg ), 
  well . 
  seems like you missed the point of my message ? 
  ww2 jokes aside , i do n't think it has much to do with it . 
  personally , i think the `` resentment '' stems from the cultural gap between germany and austria . 
  while we share a common language , social and cultural norms ( like humour ) can vary significantly . 
  both germans and austrians are often not aware of these differences and end up coming across as smug assholes ( in the case of germany ) or passive-aggressive simpletons ( in the case of austria ) . 
  yeah , [ cold cuts ] ( https://www.meinbezirk.at/resources/mediadb/zoom/2017/03/23/12269024_30_1492259594.jpg ) ( `` osterjause '' ) are pretty popular . 
  my grandma would always go to church with a basket full of meats and cheeses to get them blessed before family lunch . 
  also , [ young lamb/goat ] ( http://www.eduhi.at/webimg/osterkitz_gross.jpg ) ( `` osterkitz '' , think of schnitzel made out of different meat ) is commonly found on restaurant menus during easter . 
  i 'd say it 's fairly popular amongst the older folks . 
  younger people hardly ever know how to really play it . 
  that said , i played it fairly regularly with friends at various coffee houses in vienna when i was studying . 
  cafe rathaus has some pretty good tables to play it on and people regularly gather for some games . 
  decent beer too . 
  i only know the rules for a couple of years now and was never interested in it until moving to vienna . 
  but it seems like there are some people playing it in my native upper austria too . 
  frankly , i think that a strong innviertlerisch sounds most like bavarian . 
  in western austria , `` eine halbe '' or `` a hoibe '' instead of `` ein kr\u00fcgerl '' is preferred . 
  we have the gardebataillon ( or simply `` garde '' ) . 
  an infantry battalion stationed at maria-theresien-kaserne in vienna . 
  most members are just conscripts . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gozh0sxxxpo ) is what they usually do . 
  this time in winter gear . 
  this recording features the erzherzog albrecht march known from das boot . 
  each hair dresser of the shop usually has a tip jar . 
  i usually give them the change i get . 
  never heard of something like that before . 
  i have to admit , though , that rechtsgeschichte was n't my strongest subject at university . 
  i 'll try my best to find something on that soon-ish . 
  sounds interesting , but an initial google search did n't bring anything up on that for my hometown ( which is n't one of the major ones in austria , but relatively important in upper austria ? . 
  i 'll keep you updated . 
   besides that some people have an inexplicable hard-on for talking about how shit is better in austria even though they only seem to pay attention to us when it 's time to take down a bilingual road sign or during winter sporting events . 
  full disclosure , i grew up in upper austria so i was n't really exposed to carinthian politics . 
  also , i never visited slovenia for some reason . 
  that said , i really want to . 
  slovenia looks amazing . 
  but you are completely right that people in austria are n't aware of it , generally speaking . 
  which is a pity . 
  man , i moved around a lot . 
  the place i consider to be my `` hometown '' ( in upper austria ) had people living there by 1300-800 bc . 
  the first time it was mentioned in documents was in 1013 ad . 
  that said , my family just moved there some 100 years ago from somewhere that is now the czech republic . 
  no idea about any trees there . 
   at the voting place , you have to show id , so impersonation is nearly impossible . 
  interestingly enough , the nationalrats-wahlordnung does actually allow someone to vote without showing an id in its \u00a7 67 . 
  irmgard griss forgot her id when she wanted to vote back in 2016 , but was able to be identified by the majority of the election officers since she was one of the candidates on the ballot . 
  pretty much that . 
  handled my fair share of guns at the military ( steyr aug a1 , glock 17 , browning m2 , ... ) , but do n't intend to ever own one myself . 
  i do n't get the appeal of them . 
  austrian [ states ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/austria_states_english.png ) are somewhat important . 
  austrian federalism , as enshrined in our constitution , is rather weak . 
  while all federal states have legislative bodies , an executive body and systems of financial management , their power to legislate is limited to rather `` small '' areas like waste management , building regulations , ... 
  the more important matters ( criminal law , civil law , corporate law , most aspects of economic law , defense , ... ) are regulated by federal law . 
  that said , our gouverneurs ( or landeshauptm\u00e4nner ) can be quite powerful . 
  some of them are even more powerful than their party heads and act as spin doctors for their parties . 
  see lh [ pr\u00f6ll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erwin_pr\u00f6ll ) or bm [ h\u00e4upl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_h\u00e4upl ) . 
  the political aspect aside , i 'd say that the federal states are important to preserve the local culture and identity . 
  people are immensely proud of their state , even though they do n't really serve any real purpose . 
  a lot of people criticise him for supporting the anschluss . 
  to be honest , i think karl renner is for social democrats what leopold figl is for conservatives . 
  personally , i ca n't really relate to either of them as a father figure . 
  i acknowledge their service to the republic , though . 
  hans kelsen might be one of the unsung heroes in austria . 
  i 'd add rudolf gehring from the cp\u00d6 who got 5.43 % at the presidential elections of 2010 . 
  he basically covered the religious right of the gop , being pro-life and whatnot . 
  that said , his party does n't carry any weight whatsoever . 
  frankly , though , i would n't put him in the same league as atat\u00fcrk or sun yat-sen .
