  he is n't entirely uncontroversial ( to say the least ) . 
  my school now has a flag of upper austria , a flag with their own logo and a flag of the european union . 
  ca n't remember seeing those when i was attending it . 
  two more : [ grammelkn\u00f6del ] ( http://images.ichkoche.at/data/image/variations/496x384/1/innviertler-grammelknoedel-img-3227.jpg ) dumplings filled with semi-crispy pork bits . 
  my favourite dumpling filling . 
  [ beuscherl ] ( http://geschmacks.com/austria/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/01/kalbsrahmbeuscherl_mit_semmelkn\u00f6del.jpg ) heart and lung stew . 
  my favourite when i was a child , stopped eating it when i realised what 's in there , but started to eat it again . 
  we call it sulz south of the border . 
  happens all the time . 
  i regularly get mistaken as either german or australian . 
  generally speaking , european countries do n't apply [ ius soli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) but [ ius sanguini ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_sanguinis ) . 
  you acquire the citizenship of your parents and not of the place where you are born . 
  also , european countries are not like us states . 
  shared a condo in a dorm with an exchange student from south korea during my first year . 
  we did tons of stuff together , it was quite fun . 
  other than that i never really had contact to exchange students . 
  i studied law and most of my classes were in german . 
  exchange students mostly chose public international law related electives , which i did n't do myself . 
  unfortunately , all exchange students got put into a separate dorm during my exchange in finland . 
  that said , the erasmus student network was very active and there were tons of possibilities to interact with locals . 
  in the end , it depends on what you make out of your exchange yourself . 
  do n't expect locals to approach you on their own . 
  be proactive . 
  especially when you are going to study in a big city . 
  from a skiing standpoint ? 
  lech/z \u00fcrs . 
  it 's too expensive , though , and i do n't really like the towns itself . 
  for a better all-round holiday i actually prefer south tyrol ( gr\u00f6den / val gardena ) . 
  the vocab section of our book had both american and british english . 
  our professor was cool with as long as we did n't mix them up . 
  that said , our textbook was very british in pretty much every other aspect . 
   as beautiful as vienna as one can imagine , i 'm a bit biased . 
  but while bratislava 's centre is indeed beautiful , it 's like comparing rennes to paris . 
  new year 's day ( 1st january ) epiphany ( 6th january ) easter ( 26th - 28th march 2016 ) national holiday/labour day ( 1st may ) ascension day ( 5th may 2016 ) whit monday ( 16th may 2016 ) corpus christi ( 26th may 2016 ) assumption of the virgin mary ( 15th august ) national holiday/neutrality day ( 26th october ) all saints ' day ( 1st november ) immaculate conception ( 8th december ) christmas ( 24th - 26th december ) there are also some holidays unique to some federal states , like st. florian 's day in upper austria ( 4th may ) or st. rupert 's day in salzburg ( 29th september ) . 
  i do n't quite understand the three days in bratislava , but whatever . 
  [ kc dunaj ] ( http://www.kcdunaj.sk ) is quite okay for a couple of beers . 
  nice view , good music . 
  it 's pretty much decriminalised right now . 
  none of the major parties is pressing for legalisation , though . 
  at work ? 
  $ 4 for a soup , a main dish and a salad buffet . 
  water included , other drinks not . 
  at a restaurant/cafe nearby university of vienna ? 
   50 % of britons feel they 're a citizen of the eu . 
  ( one of the lowest ) just wow . 
  there are some words with multiple articles , but only one of them sounds right , depending on where you are from . 
  but no , native speakers usually do n't mix up articles or have to do tests at school . 
  personally , i 'd never go through the hassle of driving in a huge city that i do n't know . 
  [ first , i 'd probably go crazy . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2rcppdmsvg ) second , public transportation is usually good . 
  also , large cities are usually connected quite decently with each other . 
  third , parking . 
  either impossible to find or expensive . 
  anyhow , i 'd probably opt for the train or busses ( flixbus , student agency bus , ... ) . 
  by the way , you should really use the webpages of each national railway and not a third party booking page to book your tickets . 
  westbahn , \u00d6bb railjets , \u00d6bb ics and db ices offer sockets in both 1st and 2nd class . 
  frankly , i have no idea . 
  westbahn and \u00d6bb railjets have free wifi . 
  you have to pay for wifi on db ices ( and i 'm not even sure , if their service works in austria ) . 
  there is no wifi on railjets outside of austria ( e.g. 
  hungary , czech republic , germany , ... ) . 
  i 'm not sure about all trainstations , particularly about smaller ones , but there is free wifi at linz hbf , vienna westbahnhof and vienna hauptbahnhof . 
  so , and what cultural similarities do you share with your ancestors ? 
  note : i as an austrian also eat pizza and pasta at times . 
   i can understand if that 's strange and different to people who do not share that culturally experience , but i ca n't say i think that it 's not understandable . 
   that 's the thing , though . 
  i hail from a family one could probably call czech-austrian . 
  never ever would it cross my mind to call myself czech . 
  what 's the point ? 
  i share zero similarities with people from modern day bohemia , do n't speak the language and know only the very basics of the czech republic 's history through my austrian education . 
  sure , i understand when recent immigrants choose to live in communities of their own . 
  but when your great-grandparents were the last `` real '' italians ? 
  come on ... 
  what 's the point of claiming to be italian , when you never really experienced the culture ? 
  even if it 's factual , i do n't really get the implications of such a claim . 
  it 's not too personal . 
  it 's just weird for someone who is n't really rooted in sicily to claim that he/she is sicilian or of sicilian ancestry . 
  universities in austria do n't really care , if you are taking a semester or even years off . 
  i 'd even say that some faculties are rather glad when you do n't show up since some classes are filled to the brim anyway . 
  you will have to continue paying a whopping fee of $ 18,70 per semester , though . 
  at some point they will raise your fee to $ 363,36 per semester . 
  that 's when you do n't finish your program after a certain period of time . 
  i 'd definitely go for buses when you are on a budget . 
  at least when it comes to vienna - budapest and vienna - prague . 
  a train to prague costs $ 62 , [ westbus ' ] ( http://westbus.at/en ) standard fare is $ 22 . 
  we used [ m\u00e5l 1 ] ( http://www.nok.se/laromedel/sfi-sfa/sfi/sfi-studievag-2/mal-1-och-2/ ) in our basic swedish class . 
  not a huge fan of online resources . 
  austria is n't your home country . 
  and people wo n't be happy about a foreigner that 's not able to speak german who 's proposing to kick out all other foreigners . 
  sans him , of course . 
  good luck with finding said groups . 
  apparently you were n't even able to find the webpages of two of the biggest universities of the country . 
  anyhow , people like you usually wo n't fit into such groups since you yourself will have to adapt to the customs of your new country . 
  you will be the guest wherever you 'll go . 
  and in the eyes of the vast majority , people like you are just as pathetic as islamists . 
  whatever : stay wherever you are right now . 
  cultured or not , i do n't care . 
  you are n't one of us anyway . 
  austrian grandfather or not . 
  probably better to stay in whatever country you are from and protect your own culture .
