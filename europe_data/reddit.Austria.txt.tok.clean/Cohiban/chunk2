  [ beuschel ] ( http://www.tourmycountry.com/austria/vienna-pic-beuschel.htm ) : a stew made out of veal lung and heart . 
  delish !, 
  austrians are opportunist . 
  `` oh yeah , we should totally sanction the living hell out of russia '' . 
  then we invite putin to our country and do even more business with russia . 
  yeah ... 
  pretty much every single chairman of the people 's party is lacking internal support after a while . 
  nothing new . 
  personally , i 'm still quite surprised that it happened right now . 
  they simply do n't have any people left that could follow spindelegger as vice-chancellor without trashing the party 's poll numbers till the next election in 2018 . 
  they ca n't give the position to kurz yet , because they need him for the elections in four years and i 'm pretty sure everyone else will make matters worse for the party . 
  one example can be found here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r61ecyegbm, 
   austria did n't exist until the napoleonic wars what ? 
  austria has it 's roots back in 976 . 
  so , i guess there is no german artist that can be considered truly `` german '' before 1871 either ? 
  beethoven ? 
  frankfurtian . 
  schiller ? 
  well , after they found out that waltz had a german passport germans were rather eager to point out that he was indeed one of them . 
  that urged waltz to make some rather rude comments towards them , because he considered himself austrian . 
  [ trams in linz , austria ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/stra%c3%9fenbahn_linz#mediaviewer/datei:linz_hauptplatz_cityrunner.jpg ) 2 generations of bombardier cityrunners and a bombardier mountainrunner . 
   linz combines old town charm with a burgeoning creative scene that might surprise one or two who are n't up to speed with developments . 
  clearly i 'm not up to speed with developments in my hometown ... 
  well , the fence kept you out from austria and the rest of the western world . 
  [ i always thought that tyrolean regions have the most style .

  that thing is leaky as shit ... 
  it 's impossible to control it . 
  if they get caught , they get bussed to austria . 
  i 'm not even mad , europe should definitely help hungary with their patrols . 
  but that hungarian propaganda that seem to be pretty popular in this sub : ridiculous . 
  in case illegal immigrants really get to see a judge they just get deported . 
  no biggy , they 'll be back in a couple of hours . 
  same shit with the croatian border . 
  `` hurrdurr , hungary is the only country enforcing international and european law . '', 
  yeah , right . 
  busses were waiting for them and they brought them right to heiligenkreuz or nickelsdorf . 
  enforcing dublin ? 
  pfff ... nope . 
   you ca n't say hungary is n't trying its best . 
  oh please ... hungary built a leaky/useless fence and is bussing all their refugees to the austrian border in hope that they will be gone by sunset . 
  the exact same thing as all the other countries ( including austria ) do . 
   so meanwhile hungary should just ignore national and international law and just let everyone pass ? 
  well , that 's what you are doing right now anyway . 
  frankly , did n't like openoffice at all while working for our ministry of justice . 
  the compatibility with other software is just hilariously bad ... 
  the article says that the refugees were told that the bus would go to graz . 
  which was true . 
  why should they tell them how to get to germany ? 
  the austrian state is n't a travel agency . 
  edit : quite different to the case of hungary , where they told them they 'd go to the border , but stopped not even halfway there and forced them to register in a camp . 
  austrian authorities told them where they 'd go , they actually got there and did n't have to register . 
  any german/english sources ? 
  not even der standard reported that , which is rather odd . 
  i wonder why this article is getting downvoted in / r/europe ... 
   but no air force either ? 
  used to serve as a soldier at the hungarian border pre-schengen . 
  main task was to catch refugees/illegal migrants . 
  2200 soldiers had to cover 440km of border . 
  it was like tilting at windmills . 
  the hungarians are now trying the same . 
  good luck with that . 
  it 's gon na be a waste of money . 
   the uk is ** one of the few net contributors to the eu budget ** , yet a lot of us feel that we have no clout whatsoever ( take the ` election ' of juncker as ec president , for example ) . 
  before we get to the negotiating table we 're told that anything involving treaty change is a no-no , leaving a bit of tinkering with secondary legislation as the only thing we can come away with . 
  there are quite a few net contributors . 
  also , the uk is n't anywhere near the top when it comes to contribution per capita . 
  i mean , what do you expect , when the uk 's key demands include effectively getting rid of free movement of workers ? 
  there simply is n't much to discuss with him , if he is n't stepping down from that . 
  afaik the veto has never been used . 
  the reason for that is the consequence of a veto : suspension of the provision , which means that certain products ca n't be exported any more , in case efta decides to veto a piece of legislation introducing certain quality standards . 
   for norway it has allowed us to choose what directives to implement norway ca n't just choose which directives they want to implement . 
  there are some pretty narrow exceptions for norway , though . 
  agriculture , food and fishing legislation . 
  i guess you do n't realize that the economic part of the european union is going much further than classic ftas ? 
   he 's been told to fuck off , ignored , insulted and bullied at every turn . 
  he just does n't get what he wants . 
  not surprising considering that he has a pretty bad bargaining position . 
  that bargaining position will get even worse when you left . 
   no political union , just a trade union you really think that a common market would work without common rules ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diomzshsyy8 ) : qualtinger/heller - bei mir sads olle im oasch daham ( proper wienerlied ), 
   it 's quite funny how you 're moaning about the uk when nearly every eu member does exactly the same thing . 
  which other countries have been threatening to leave the eu for years ? 
  well , there 's option a of sitting down like adults and discuss and enact reforms in a professional manner and there is option b of handing over a catalogue of demands with a post-it on it saying `` we might leave , if you are n't doing what we want '' . 
  also , see boris ' opinion on how to deal with migrants and the eu . 
  [ stuff like that pops up every other week . 
  ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/453989/reform-or-face-collapse-george-osborne-warns-the-eu-that-uk-could-leave ) edit : [ and of course , boris is always good for a snarky remark . 
  ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4234779.ece ), 
   when 's the uk threatened to veto something ? 
  i guess i lost track of the many times a member of the british government declared something like `` if it 's not done our way , we 'll leave !, 
  in which ways is efta better than the eu ? 
  how do you envision a revitalised efta ? 
  frankly , calls for efta are n't thought-through properly 99 % of times . 
   or austria saying they 'll kill uk 's reforms if it does n't take any refugees in . 
  well , it 's time for the uk to accept that threatening other member states works both ways . 
  i do n't understand it either , but i 'm not questioning it at the moment . 
  germany has a coalition of cdu/csu and spd , austria has a sp\u00d6 and \u00d6vp coalition . 
  it 's basically the same .
