  frankly , i do n't see germany taking in an unlimited number of refugees . 
  they will close their borders at some point . 
  that 's when they 'll all be stranded in austria . 
  i assume schengen will be suspended at some point and asse gr\u00dc will be put in place again until they figure out a quota system . 
  not at all . 
  unlike germany , we do n't expect the refugees to actually stay here . 
  best way to avoid making friends . 
   is it possible for foreigners to get jobs in those areas ? 
  it 's fairly easy to get a job in hospitality during winter . 
  the hotels/restaurants in s\u00f6lden , ischgl and the likes are full of foreigners . 
  besides that , most other capitals ( graz , linz , salzburg , innsbruck , ... ) are pretty cosmopolitan as well . 
  it 's one of the ways to get austrians very upset . 
   common military lol, 
  well , it 's a pretty rational decision . 
  germany said that they would n't reject syrian refugees , so we would they apply in austria ? 
  not that i consider that okay in any way , btw . 
  the canteen/mensa at my alma mater ( faculty of law/university of vienna ) basically only served goulash , coffee , beer and white wine . 
  happy hours ( buy one , get two ) during finals . 
  they open at 7:00 ... 
  so , there are actually cabs with legit meters in prague ? 
  huh . 
  seems like i got ripped off big times as well . 
  the `` letter from europe '' section , under which this piece is filed on the nyt webpage , only consists of opinions . 
  as many other countries , austria has a lower chamber , the [ nationalrat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_council_ ( austria ) ) ( 183 mps ) , and one that ( should ) represent the federal states , the [ bundesrat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_council_ ( austria ) ) ( 61 mps ) . 
  proposals for federal legislation are received by the nationalrat as applications by at least 5 mps of the nationalrat or a whole nationalrat committee , as bills from the federal government or as applications by at least 2/3 of the bundesrat 's mps . 
  additionally , any application presented by 100 000 persons who are entitled to vote or by one sixth of the persons entitled to vote in three federal states must be submitted to the nationalrat for its attention . 
  in practical political terms , federal government bills play the most important role . 
  bills passed by the nationalrat must , after the procedure in the bundesrat , be submitted by the federal chancellor to the federal president for authentication . 
  now , technically the bundesrat can veto any proposals by the nationalrat . 
  it 's only a suspensive veto , though . 
  if the nationalrat really wants to introduce federal legislation against the wish of the bundesrat , they can easily do so . 
  the bundesrat is really just a powerless body . 
  a playground for politicians that are either too young/inexperienced for the nationalrat or for those that were involved in a minor scandal and had to leave federal politics . 
  tl ; dr : our second chamber is a waste of time and money . 
  none of our political parties want to get rid of it , though , because that would make a couple of those slackers jobless . 
   the way i see it , switzerland and norway are profiting almost as if they were part of the eu , but still get to do pretty much what they want , i.e. 
  all the benefits without any of the obligations ( simplifying , of course ) . 
  switzerland and norway have pretty much the same obligations as every regular eu member state without representation in any of the eu 's organs . 
  in addition to that , they have to pay billions of euros to be able to enjoy the benefits of the eu . 
  see bilateral agreement i/ii ( switzerland ) and the eea agreement ( norway ) . 
  [ well , we have a history of not giving a shit about the song contest .

   nope in loving memory < 3, 
  the biggest problem are n't those that actually get asylum status , it 's those that come to the country who want to apply for asylum . 
  internationally ? 
  probably graz . 
  despite being the second largest city of austria it 's kinda unpopular amongst tourists . 
  imo it 's a neat city , with great restaurants and nightlife ( if you are a student and twenty-something ) . 
  nationally ? 
  it has a pretty bad reputation , but is quite pleasant overall . 
  things improved significantly over the last twenty years . 
  it 's better on the second day anyway :p, 
  [ wiener schnitzel ] ( http://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/onj1oqzl8gwltcbbnk0gjg/o.jpg ) it 's been a while . 
  one month ago ? 
  back when i studied i usually had it once or twice a week . 
  [ cafe votiv ] ( http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/votiv-wien ) has a pretty rad schnitzel for ~ $ 4.70 during lunchtime . 
  [ unhcr already told them multiple times . 
  ] ( http://www.smh.com.au/world/united-nations-warns-australia-about-asylum-seeker-boat-pushbacks-20140110-hv83u.html ), 
  you are right . 
  they are n't refugees , but [ asylum seekers ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c137.html ) . 
  that 's why it 's illegal to push them back . 
  yeah , the biggest `` native '' minorities have always been slovenes in carinthia/styria and croatians/hungarians in burgenland . 
  the new arrivals outnumber them by far , though . 
  pushbacks are illegal according to international and european law . 
  you can usually point out the people from bavaria as well . 
  rolled r , a couple of different words , a different sub-group of bavarian , ... 
  [ j\u00f6rg haider 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j\u00f6rg_haider#death_and_aftermath ) and [ crown prince ruldolf 's ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mayerling_incident ) deaths are also quite mysterious . 
   in hungary , right at the border with austria , in mosonmagyarovar there are plenty of dentists who speak german as well ( vienese clients ) . 
  it 's the same at the czech border with upper austria . 
  dentists , fireworks and hookers . 
  infantry usually does 10 , 20 or 40 kilometre marches with backpack , helmet and weapon . 
  the 20 kilometre one is by far the most common . 
  24 hour or even week-long exercises are also done , but you do n't carry all your stuff 24/7 . 
  alpine training is usually only done with a light backpack , but with skies and your rifle . 
  frankly , i do n't see the problem . 
  there are plenty of people doing their mandatory military service as part of the infantry that are n't allowed to carry more than 25 kilos or march more than 20 kilometres . 
  no problem , they just tell their nco and skip out after reaching their restriction . 
   i spent too much money in the praterstern park tho . 
  i guess you mean the prater ? 
  you go to praterstern for the drugs and to ( wurstel - ) prater for the rollercoasters , 
  mandatory military service is not navy seals training . 
  frankly , there was not a single thing that a relatively fit woman could n't do at my military training . 
  i did not imply that british people are stupid . 
  the political discussion surrounding a possible exit would be the same in pretty much every country . 
  even in austria . 
  you just have to look at the messages that appeal to the masses . 
  it 's not a reasonable debate about the advantages of common agricultural policy that get 's you votes . 
  it 's the simple , populist messages and the parties know that . 
  `` we have too many immigrants from eastern europe !, 
  '' , `` we do n't want germany to rule over us !, 
  you seem to be rather optimistic . 
  there is no way that the more reasonable voices will be heard in this debate . 
  it will be all about populism . 
  totally depends on cameron 's proposal .

  it is precisely `` some documentation '' missing that prevented them from taking the weapons on board . 
  the government of the united stated of america purchasing block seating en masse did n't help at all .
