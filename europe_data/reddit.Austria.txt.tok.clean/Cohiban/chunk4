  the `` some documentation '' seems to be the key factor . 
  the problem was that they wanted to leave the transit area with some weapons . 
  the weapons on their plane were fine . 
   but most of the time we just call them `` bergjuden '' ( mountain jews ) . 
  you must be a jolly bunch . 
  apparently they like to make fun of our bavarian dialect . 
  also , they think of us as some kind of hillbillies . 
  if that would come from some northern germans , fine . 
  but seriously ? 
  switzerland ? 
  have they ever heard their own dialect ? 
  not anymore . 
  the austrian flag has been around since approx . 
  it used to be the flag of the [ house of babenberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_babenberg ) and was later adopted by the house of habsburg . 
  back then , it used to be a regional flag , the national flag has been the black and yellow one . 
  in 1768 the austrian navy began to use the flag as [ their ensign ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/seekriegsflagge#/media/file:austria-hungary-flag-1869-1914-naval-1786-1869-merchant.svg ) . 
  later on it was used in the flag of austria-hungary to represent cisleithania . 
   the ultimatum was a series of 10 demands created to destroy most of serbian sovereignty , and their influence in the balkans . 
  i disagree . 
  all in all , the main goals were to stop the serbian ambition to expand into a-h , to cut down serbian propaganda against a-h and to bring those to justice that were responsible for the assassination . 
  the text of the ultimatum can be found [ here ] ( http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/austrianultimatum.htm ) . 
  the two demands that ultimately led to war :  ( 5 ) to accept the ** collaboration in serbia of representatives of the austro-hungarian government ** for the suppression of the subversive movement directed against the territorial integrity of the monarchy ;  ( 6 ) to take judicial proceedings against accessories to the plot of the 28th of june who are on serbian territory ; ** delegates of the austro-hungarian government will take part in the investigation relating thereto ** serbia - quite understandably - did n't want any austro-hungarian investigators in their country since it would weaken their sovereignty to some degree , but it certainly would n't have destroyed serbian sovereignty all together . 
  the reason for this demand is quite obvious , though : a-h did n't trust serbian officials , just like serbian officials did n't trust a-h .

  you realize that the dialects spoken in lower austria and south tyrol are part of the ostmittelbairisch and s\u00fcdbairisch groups of dialects ? 
  the co-founder died a while ago . 
  not entirely sure who inherited his 49 % share . 
  anyway , red bull gmbh is incorporated and produced in austria . 
   j. dienstbier still fucking hilarious . 
  accepting a new ( / better ) deal for greece would be political suicide for most ruling parties . 
  expect a clear `` no '' from many countries besides germany . 
  especially after all that bullshit during the last couple of days . 
  yeah , but those do n't have to hold an in/out eurozone referendum today . 
  also , not the leader of the eu/eurozone . 
  which many people seem to forget . 
   simply demand supervision and reforms needed to ensure the money is not misspent wait , was n't that what the eurozone did ? 
  you know , until the greek press came up with merkel/hitler caricatures ? 
   are there any countries you ever helped or you can call friends ? 
  well ... 
  i guess there is half of cyprus ?

  nope , but / u/countvontroll apparently is . 
  that 's not what i said . 
  in the end , the austrians approved the anschluss . 
  but the person who carried out the referendum was a german . 
  i would have let that joke slip . 
  but not when it 's from a german .

  ] ( https://mobile.twitter.com/yanisvaroufakis/status/615127339102531584 ), 
  judging by his actions and speeches . 
   greece might ( perhaps it was even probable ) just leave the eurozone but not the eu . 
  there is no legal basis for just leaving the eurozone . 
  i disagree , though , that this is non-negotiable . 
  on a different note , i think it 's pretty funny that this clown 's blog gets that much attention on / r/europe . 
   other countries did the same with bigger scale compared to ours but none bats an eye . 
  because those countries are n't going to default within the next few days . 
  [ probably relevant ] ( http://previews.123rf.com/images/jcv/jcv0903/jcv090300042/4531540-shipwreck-after-an-storm-in-the-mediterranean-sea--stock-photo.jpg ), 
  i suppose [ essigwurst ] ( http://www.gutekueche.at/img/rezept/6840/essigwurst.jpg ) or schweizer wurstsalat ( probably not austrian ) are also quite popular during summer .

  [ certainly not the best excuse ] ( http://www.koer.or.at/cgi-bin/img.pl?id=1318 ), 
  it was a compromise . 
  initially both the hungarians and the kingdom of croatia-slavonia wanted to rule over bosnia . 
  the latter wanted to secede from hungary and form a new entity within the austro-hungarian empire ( `` trialsm '' ) . 
  since both a more influential hungary and a third entity within the empire would have harmed that fragile state , they just decided to split it between austria and hungary . 
  / r/news = american news / r/worldnews = international american news sad but true ... 
  technically , bosnia was never a kronland of austria , but a `` gemeinsames land '' . 
  i know that many people are sentimental when it comes to nokia , but come on ... that company has n't been innovative for years . 
  and that wo n't change after acquiring a french company that 's pretty much as fucked ( when it comes to mobile phones ) as nokia . 
  sorry to break it to you , but that company has been dead for a couple of years now ...

  but the judgement does n't say that people need to be verified . 
  it just says that internet platforms are liable for inherently unlawful content posted by their users . 
  they could just hire mods to delete those messages that are unlawful . 
  or at least delete those messages people complain about via the `` report this message '' - option . 
   its non-enforcable unless you break anonymity and far too impractical to begin with . 
  well , that 's the point of the decision . 
  providers are liable for the content published by anonymous users . 
  i do n't understand why it should be non-enforcable unless you break anonymity of their users . 
   what if a website is rushed by trolls ? 
  what if those were trolls from a different country , delibaretely aiming to cripple the website ?
