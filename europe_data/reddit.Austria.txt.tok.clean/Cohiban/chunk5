  they would have to moderate the comment section or just turn it off . 
  afaik delfi has a `` report this post '' function and has some automated filters . 
  if they knew about the violations ( which seems to be the case ) they would have been liable even under 2000/31/ec . 
  frankly , i do n't see a huge problem with that decision . 
  especially since the ecthr is ruling on a case-by-case basis . 
  well , a tl ; dr is rather tricky . 
  chances are that important things get lost . 
  but here are two of my sources : the european union 's agency for fundamental rights has a [ pretty good handbook on asylum/dublin ] ( http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/handbook-law-asylum-migration-borders_en.pdf ) . 
  it 's pretty extensive , but it has a nice table of content where you can pick those topics that interest you . 
  here is a nice [ paper on the execution of judgements of the ecthr ] ( https://www.icl-journal.com/download/f1527ce403500a9ec58b8269a9a91471/icl_thesis_vol_7_3_13.pdf ) . 
  his daughter is a mep . 
  his fn membership got suspended . 
  anyhow , fn obviously has some huge issues with certain members . 
  as does the fp\u00d6 , btw . 
  imo pretty hard to deny that . 
  frankly , i think most of the threads discussing immigration/refugees or opinion pieces of newspapers are fairly boring . 
  most people are just too emotional about it . 
  be it the left or the right . 
  news on it is pretty interesting , though . 
  anyhow , it made me research stuff like the ecthr 's sanction system or the dublin regulations in detail , so i might have actually learned something . 
  not questioning that at all . 
  even countries that are better off for the moment would struggle to pay an additional 1.5 billion a month . 
   the cost is 1.2 to 1.5 billion euros per month starting by this month . 
  err ... 
  which translates to : he is pretty sure that the treaty of lissabon wo n't be the last european treaty he 'll experience . 
  he did n't directly say , though , that he supports a treaty change in order to implement the proposals of the uk . 
  he went on that the uk 's call for reform might be in the interest of austria . 
  but freedom of movement is set in stone . 
  in the end , he just did n't want to disgruntle hammond . 
  diplomacy at its best . 
  frankly , not at all . 
  everything got easier abroad . 
  ca n't think of any benefits the schilling had to offer to me as a consumer ( in contrast to the benefits it offered to the state ) . 
   i was born in russia , lived in america , and currently in europe , and this has shaped a firm neutral position because i hold characteristics of all three cultures . 
  the flair of a neutral country does n't necessarily make you neutral . 
  personally , i also think that that would be pretty unfair . 
  [ but here seems to be the explanation . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11249111/banning-migrants-from-in-work-benefits-would-reduce-financial-incentive-to-move-to-britain-study-concludes.html ), 
  frankly , changing 1 ) could be interesting as well . 
  would n't that be the perfect excuse for blocking/not adopting/bitching about pretty much every piece of legislation they do n't agree with ? 
  apparently he also wants to restrict in-work benefits for migrants . 
   from the perspective of serbia it 's funny , because serbia actually wanted the same as austria-hungary : expand into foreign countries . 
   austria and slovenia are the only countries uses regional coats of arms there are also some registration plate with the federal coat of arms : [ police , military , postal service , ... ] ( http://oekastatic.orf.at/static/images/site/oeka/20120936/polizeiauto_kennzeichen472.5089105.jpg ) [ diplomats ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/\u00d6sterreichisches_diplomatenkennzeichen_wd-82212.jpg ) do n't carry any coat of arms at all . 
  would be pretty cool , though , if they were allowed to carry the one of their home country or organization . 
   except it is . 
  do you really think your other taxes never increased less due to germans paying all the time ? 
  ** do you really not think if you did n't have that you austrians would be paying a lot more than you pay for your vingette now ? 
  ** the same can be said for every other system , including the one you germans propose . 
   not even to mention that your system ( well , probably ours too ) heavily favours people who pay for a whole your compared to people who just go skying 1-3 times a year . 
  i might pay 15 $ for two sky trips , you pay 80 $ for 360 days . 
  so yeah do n't tell me how fair your system is . 
  as you said , your system also favours those who choose the longer option . 
  by the way , the ecj already ruled on that issue and forced a couple of countries to adapt their prices . 
  in addition to that , you are discriminating against foreigners by de facto not charging germans . 
   because german tourist pay for their vingietty all the time . 
  yeah , but austrians are paying as well . 
  which is n't the case in your model . 
  unfortunately , people that vote for the fp\u00d6 seem to have the attention span of a goldfish ... 
  the last federal state of austria to join the republic was burgenland in 1921 . 
  four years after wwi ended . 
  formerly known as `` deutsch-westungarn '' , it was renamed after four `` burgen '' ( castles ) located within burgenland , which ultimately ended up on the hungarian/slovakian side , though ( \u00d6denburg-sopron , wieselburg-moson , pre\u00dfburg-bratislava and eisenburg-vas ) . 
  well , the german 's technically have to pay , but they do n't since they get it refunded via the vehicle tax . 
  which is bullshit since that tax is n't entirely used to fund infrastructure . 
  no other country with a toll system introduced bullshit legislation like that . 
  but hey , the ecj will have to decide on that issue . 
  and i 'm pretty sure that germany will lose . 
  no , the tolls and the vehicle tax are n't pretty much the same . 
  the money that they get out of the vehicle tax is used for anything . 
  the military , housing projects , public schools ... 
  so i do n't quite understand why the germans should get a refund/discount just because they pay a regular tax . 
  nope . 
  because their taxes are n't for a specific purpose . 
  you germans do n't get penalised in france or switzerland . 
  you just have to pay like the french and the swiss . 
   to treat non-residents equally they 'd have to start paying the german car tax first . 
  you can hardly give a tax rebate for a tax that is n't applied in the first place , can you ? 
  that 's not true . 
  in addition to a vehicle tax we austrians have to pay a normverbauchsabgabe . 
  a tax that does n't even exist in germany . 
  yet we do n't get a discount or charge foreigners extra for a vignette . 
  because that would be discriminatory . 
  nobody would complain , if german citizens would have to pay just like foreigners . 
  which is n't the case and that 's why they get sued . 
  there is a basis for change , the uk chose not to change much . 
  for better or worse , wwi was game-changing for austria . 
  apparently only 47 postmen got bitten by dogs in 2014 . 
  now they buy 10 tons of dog treats per year . 
  that screams corruption . 
  the city as a whole ? 
  yeah , it 's pretty good here . 
  those areas are pretty bad , though , even when compared to other large european cities . 
  ever been to the areas close to laxenburgerstra\u00dfe ? 
  mexikoplatz ? 
  yes , vienna is generally very safe , but there certainly are areas i would n't want to go to in the middle of the night . 
  that said , these areas are n't anywhere near the tourist hotspots and even viennese people from the more affluent parts of the city usually do n't go there . 
  not that there is actually anything of interest near those areas anyway ... 
  some districts of vienna are a bit shady . 
  looking at you favoriten , rudolfsheim-f\u00fcnfhaus , ... 
  nothing to really worry about , but probably best to avoid at night . 
  those areas are pretty far off the beaten path anyway .
