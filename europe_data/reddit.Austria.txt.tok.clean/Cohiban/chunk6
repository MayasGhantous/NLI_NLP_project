  other than that , austria is pretty tame . 
  have seen it in pretty random bars . 
  nachbar in 1080 comes to my mind , it 's fairly common , though . 
  kozel and staropramen are readily available in many viennese bars and restaurants . 
  i enjoy both . 
   i do n't even know what you are trying to say here . 
  what discounts are you talking about ? 
  there are no discounts and there is no discrimination . 
  everybody will pay exactly the same toll . 
  [ relevant , but illegal ] ( http://www.heute.at/storage/scl/bilder/leserreporter-fotos/954414_m3w620h372q80v34806_vignetten.jpg ), 
   disfigure my beautiful car with their horrible pickerl . 
  i 'm with you on that ... 
  especially when you have like five of them on your car ... all from different countries ... 
  well , naturally austrians are causing a lot of traffic in bavaria since using the a8/a93 or one of the bundesstra\u00dfen is literally the only way to get into the western part of our country . 
  that 's pretty annoying for bavarians living in the border region . 
  the fact that we are allowed to drive for free and that bavarians have to pay for our vignette caused the csu to propose the ausl\u00e4ndermaut . 
  so yeah , i guess they are pretty pissed . 
  a maut in bavaria would n't be a biggy , if everyone had to pay for it ( like in austria ) . 
  now we are a bit cranky since effectively it 's only a `` ausl\u00e4ndermaut '' . 
   how often do i have to repeat this ? 
  vehicle tax alone is not enough . 
  all the revenue from vehicle and gasoline tax goes into road maintenance - and then some from unrelated taxes . 
  i know and that 's why your government 's argument does n't make any sense at all !, 
  it would make sense to give germans a discount on vehicle tax , if that would be the ** only ** source for maintenance of your roads . 
  instead your roads are maintained not only by your vehicle tax and gasoline tax , but by ** every single tax ** germans and foreigners pay . 
  it 's the same deal in every single other country . 
  even austria and switzerland , who are additionally charging for the use of their roads . 
  the difference : we are charging everyone . 
  we do n't give discounts to those who are paying taxes of any sorts . 
  we pay kfz-steuer , we pay nova , we pay a whole bunch of other taxes . 
  all of them are ( partially ) used to keep our roads intact . 
  yet we do n't get any discounts or benefits from it when buying a vignette . 
  because that would be discrimination and that 's why we are complaining . 
   i do n't think you understand the first thing about how the german autobahn is financed , toll or not . 
  i understand how german streets are financed , but the main argument of germany is that they already pay vehicle tax ( which is n't normally paid by citizens of other countries ) so they should get exempted/get a refund on the toll fee . 
  now , i 'd ( kinda ) understand that when the revenue of the kfz-steuer would only be used for maintaining and building roads . 
  but that 's not the case . 
  and no , i do n't give a shit about how much one has to pay for using your roads . 
  but when your only argument is that you already pay kfz-steuer ( which is a questionable argument at best ) than just scrap it all together and introduce a pay-out-of-your-pocket model . 
  if you would have done that there would n't be a discussion about discrimination altogether . 
  sure , people would still moan about it , but discrimination would be out of the equation . 
  when it 's clear that they only reduce the cost of vehicle registration because they want to avoid charging germans for their toll that 'd be indirect discrimination , which is also illegal . 
  i 'm objecting , because i do n't agree with the fact that germans should be entitled to a tax refund/discount on their vehicle tax . 
  mostly because the vehicle tax is n't `` zweckgebunden '' , meaning that it 's not even sure that germans are actually paying for using the streets . 
  hence you ca n't be sure , if everybody is actually paying the same for using the streets . 
  again , just introduce a proper maut for everyone ( be it in - or ausl\u00e4nder ) . 
  scrap your kfz-steuer and everyone is happy . 
  yes , i really think so . 
  mostly because the idea stems from the csu and everybody knows that they are pissed that we have to use your autobahn in order to reach our western states . 
   fact is : foreigners continue to pay considerably less for the usage of german roads than germans . 
  that 's true for pretty much every country that has a toll system . 
  while germans pay for an austrian vignette they do n't contribute as much in taxes as austrians do . 
  so , austrians should be entitled to a tax refund of sorts as well ? 
  quite frankly , i do n't understand how i 'm the nationalist in this debate . 
  germany is clearly introducing a discriminatory toll system mostly aimed against austrians . 
  and yes , you are paying a higher vehicle tax , which is supposed to finance your streets . 
  but then we are paying more income tax and other fun stuff like the normverbrauchsabgabe , the latter does n't even exist in germany . 
  both are financing our streets . 
  yet we do n't get any tax goodies or discounts on our vignette . 
  because that would be discriminatory as well . 
  nobody would complain , if germany would introduce a toll system , where everybody has to pay the same and without such shady tax deals . 
  fine , then let 's increase our toll and give people a tax bonus on taxes only austrians are paying . 
  that 's what germany will do and that 's what i 'm complaining about . 
  oh , right . 
  huh , seems like we 'll have to charge german 's for studying in austria instead . 
  i 'm looking forward to the moment when the bavarians realize that instead of paying for driving on the a8/a93 , we 'll just clog their bundesstra\u00dfen . 
  joke 's on you , germany . 
  i hope it 's not karl habsburg ...

   as for now you can you can smoke everywhere , unless you see a sign which forbids it . 
  its a topic thats in the news from time to time in the last years and there will be a smoke ban this , or the year to come ( for restaurants , bars , official buildings ) like in italy . 
  it 's forbidden in all public buildings . 
  then again , the people frequenting the faculty of law of uni vienna and pretty much everybody who goes to a canteen of an austrian judicial court does n't seem to give a fuck . 
  oh , the irony . 
   im personally for this ban , since it makes going out more fun imo - often you can wash your hair twice the next day and dont wear the cloths for a week or so . 
  quite frankly , the short excerpt of fischer 's speech is n't really capturing the tone of his original piece .
