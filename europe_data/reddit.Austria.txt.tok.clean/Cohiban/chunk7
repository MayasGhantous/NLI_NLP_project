  [ i guess we are known for our mountains .

  well , all animosities aside , otto seemed like a fairly capable politician . 
  some of his policies as a mep were quite tacky , though . 
  karl on the other hand is a moron ... 
  technically he was from the archbishopric of salzburg . 
  the empire was n't a state per se . 
  well , our government is in a relatively convenient position : most of the mass-surveilance of austrians actually happens in germany , the uk or the us itself ( internet , phones , ... ) . 
  that still leaves various known spying location in and around vienna and in western austria . 
  the first one was a pretty old-school surveilance station in a nice old villa , which they closed after it got too much media attention . 
  people got upset when they were told by austrian police to not take photos of the building , but could n't explain why . 
  now , supporting a foreign intelligence service operating in austria is one of the few things that 's illegal in austria . 
  so technically those police officers commited a felony . 
  nothing happened to them , though . 
  apparently they moved that office to their [ un embassy ] ( http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/breitbart/breitbart-london/2014/09/24/izd_tower_von_donauturm.jpg ) ( notice that suspicious looking thing they built on top the building ? 
  ) , where they allegedly do most of their spying on the un . 
  the us embassy to austria also has such a thing on it 's roof . 
  now , here is the fun part : spying as such is n't illegal in austria . 
  it 's only illegal when it 's directed towards the republic of austria or it 's citizens . 
  they sure as hell spy on the un and on most of cee . 
  from what i 've seen , their stations reach well into ukraine . 
  but it 's impossible to tell , if they spy on austria ( probably yeah ) . 
  there are some other surveillance stations ( or `` radio communication stations '' ; k\u00f6nigswarte and neulengbach ) officially run by the austrian bundesheer , but there seems to be proof that they are also used by us military . 
  nobody knows why they were built , but apparently they were partially financed by the us government . 
  given our neutrality that 's the only thing that 's going to be hard to explain for our government . 
  interestingly enough , i have seen some us military officers running around neulengbach during my mandatory service at the army myself . 
  no clue what they did there , though . 
  haha , got the same tip during my military service in austria . 
  my go-to austrian newspapers are [ die presse ] ( http://diepresse.com ) , [ der standard ] ( http://standard.at ) and [ salzburger nachrichten ] ( http://salzburg.com ) . 
  die presse is centrist/conservative , der standard is leftist and the salzburger nachrichten are liberal ( not in the us ' sense ) / centrist . 
  all three are considered to be the best newspapers in austria . 
  salzburger nachrichten are probably the least biased . 
  in addition to that i check out the webpages of neue z\u00fcrcher zeitung , a couple of german newspapers and some english-language news . 
  taz is actually pretty far from being unbiased . 
  but at least you know what to expect when buying a copy . 
  * [ erzherzog albrecht marsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlbdggx47ik ) * [ radetzkymarsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afm9pv8rypq ) * [ schneidig vor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdd_0swpeae ) * [ o , du mein \u00d6sterreich ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfnmpgvcpz4 ) : * [ radetzkys nachruf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izwuywuux4i ) : a funeral march , usually played by the military . 
  * [ kaiserj\u00e4germarsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ctwhetzega ) lots of other relatively well known marches ( erzherzog rainer marsch , hessen marsch , ... ) . 
  we sucked at fighting , but at least our music was classy . 
  the european parliament will have to agree on the visa waiver program , so i do n't really get your concern ? 
  do you want to hold a referendum on every visa policy decision ? 
  or just when certain ( * cough * ) countries are affected by it ? 
  because you would spend a lot of time casting your votes in the first case . 
  so , when should they have introduced the new law in order to not be suspiciously close to those elections ? 
  they started to amend the asylgesetz since november 2015 . 
  at that point they did n't even know when the bp election would take place . 
  the balkan route is closed . 
  you mentioned idomeni yourself . 
  at which border is that supposed to happen ? 
  at the italian one ? 
  the one the fp\u00d6 still does n't want to close ? 
  frankly , the fp\u00d6 proved already more than once that they are not capable of running the country . 
  just like \u00d6vp and sp\u00d6 . 
  you see , that 's the difference between what the opposition does ( fp\u00d6 : `` ausl\u00e4nder raus , sofort ! '' ), 
  and political reality . 
  sure , it took them too long to act . 
  but it 's not like you can change a law by snipping a finger . 
  the proposal for the most recent changes were discussed publicly for a couple of weeks now and everybody knew that it 's only a matter of time for it getting implemented . 
  yeah ... 
  it 's just that the current government and various groups in parliament were discussing possible solutions to the migration problem for months now . 
  yeah , hofer still has to win the second round in order to become the president . 
  you really think they drafted that piece of legislation within three days ? 
  well , he definitely is wrong . 
  germany and austria have never been a single country except during those 7 years under hitler . 
  culturally we are influenced by the multi-ethnic empire austria-hungary was . 
  the only thing that 's fundamentally the same is our common language . 
  in terms of citizenship ? 
  not really . 
  frankly , i do n't really care about the outcome of the election and i totally understand that people are fed up with sp\u00d6vp . 
  but this time there were more than enough options on both sides of the political spectrum that are n't affiliated with a party that constantly has problems with right-wing extremists . 
  so , yeah . 
  call me salty as much as you want . 
  in the meantime i 'll continue to call out people that are electing far-right hicks which are as bad , or even worse , than the political establishment . 
  for proof , refer to previous governments with fp\u00d6 involvement . 
   but more importantly , hofer himself disagrees with these views . 
  yes . 
  he was almost as convincing as bill clinton when he said `` i did not have sexual relations with that woman '' ... 
   city people are already calling us stupid nazi fucks . 
  in case you are offended by that , you should n't have voted for a guy that 's a member of an organization that does n't recognize austria as a nation and calls germany `` the fatherland '' . 
  do n't want to break the circlejerk , but that 's old news from november 2015 . 
  edit : [ some more infos on it . 
  ] ( http://www.thelocal.se/20151110/swede-defends-anti-nazi-event-without-jews ), 
  the same way you put off your clothes . 
  anyway , linguists are cunts . 
   i think all lawyers are cunts . 
  [ edgy . 
   neither are b\u00f6hmermann 's blatant racist slurs badly disguised as satire . 
  wait , you are implying that b\u00f6hmermann is just a racist disguising his racism as satire ? 
  historically , [ aff\u00e4re mayerling ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mayerling_incident ) . 
  edit : oh , and of course the natascha kampusch abduction . 
  [ just saw a report ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/justiz/natascha-kampusch-zweifel-an-suizid-des-entfuehrers-wolfgang-priklopil-a-1087957.html ) that seems to suggest that wolfang priklopil - the kidnapper - did n't commit suicide . 
  so , you only want to liberalise trade in goods ? 
  not a very smart move , but go ahead . 
  edit : now that i think about it , that would be germany 's wet dream . 
  the nightmare of the brits of true federalisation is just that : a nightmare . 
  no way that that will happen anytime soon . 
  i guess you forget about the most recent news from poland ... 
  taiwan is certainly not a police state and hong kong does n't fit that description either . 
  i guess you meant singapore ? 
  i agree , but it 's not for those that do n't like filled chocolates . 
  i highly recommend touring their [ production facilities ] ( http://www.zotter.at/en/choco-shop-theatre/choco-tour.html ) .
