  because that was what faymann was commenting on and not the mere fact that hungary wants to get rid of migrants . 
  might be true , but not a reason for spreading misinformation and hate . 
  asse/schengen lasted till 2011 , but we were n't allowed to stop anyone from crossing the border anymore . 
  the government made it pretty clear that they do n't plan to use conscripts for migration control . 
  full quote and context , please . 
  because ( a ) that 's not what he said and ( b ) what he actually said was in a different context . 
  things are almost never solely positive or negative . 
  promoting free movement is probably more interesting for many central european countries whereas liberalising the financial market is in the interest of the uk . 
  you are basically asking to take away an advantage from others without offering anything in return . 
  do n't take me wrong , i 'd do the same . 
  but it 's unlikely that 27 member states will agree to that . 
   mount athos is a monastery ...  liechtenstein i guess you have to leave the eu then and get a special deal following that . 
  good luck !, 
   denmark which one of the four freedoms is affected ? 
  by the way , denmark is n't the only country doing that . 
   channel islands just like mount athos : to small to be of much concern . 
  if you want something similar : leave and try to rejoin or get a trade deal instead . 
  i think it 's pretty clear that freedom of movement has it 's pros and cons . 
  if the uk thinks it does n't need freedom of movement , they should leave and try to get their own special little trade agreement . 
  there has never been an opt-out from one of the fundamental freedoms . 
  not even for non-members like switzerland . 
  considering the reactions after our western neighbors referendum on eu migration , i would think that opt-outs like that can be ruled out . 
  it 's just unfair to other member states and risks that the eu falls apart when other countries start to think they are special . 
  well , then he should probably propose plans for said reform . 
  all he is asking for - over and over again - are opt-outs from key features of the eu . 
  that wo n't fly . 
  never . 
  at least not for free . 
   if he did n't get any concessions , he would campaign to leave and we would almost certainly exit the eu . 
  if you have a look at his demands , it seems like he does n't want to be part of the the club anyway . 
  seems like a better option to leave , pray to god and hope for a new/better deal within the next 15 years . 
  the money from the `` membership fee '' is basically peanuts . 
  the remaining 27 could easily make up for that . 
  if he really thinks that that 's his main bargaining position then , well ... 
  i think he overestimates the options he has ... 
  http://derstandard.at/2000029210423/fluechtlinge-faymann-interview-sorgt-international-fuer-verwirrung he was talking about reinforcing measures that are already in place for a long time . 
  non-news from an austrian tabloid and rt. . . 
  i agree . 
  he basically wants to keep all the goodies they are enjoying right now plus opt-outs to an extent we 've never experienced before . 
  at the same time , he gives nothing in return . 
  good luck with getting the signature of 27 member states . 
  might be a vienna thing this . 
  that city is losing it 's dialect just as quickly as most parts of germany . 
  did you just describe davies wet dream ? 
  sorry , but there is no way that 's going to happen ... 
  i tried to include the most important events , but lesser known pictures/moments just like last year . 
  [ 1921  ( http://mek.oszk.hu/01900/01906/html/cd9/kepek/tortenelem/to071fit171.jpg ) the beaten charles i tried a last time to revive austria-hungary . 
  here pictured during his coup d'etat in hungary ( 1921 ) . 
  kneeling during field mess . 
  after that the monarchy was done for good . 
  [ 1934  ( http://dort.pw/images/februar_34/1934_02_12_linz_hotel_schiff_bundesheer.jpg ) the starting point of the forgotten austrian civil war . 
  austrian military and police raided the headquarters of the social democrats in linz ( hotel schiff ) looking for illegal weapons . 
  shots were fired . 
  [ 1945  ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/kz_mauthausen.jpg ) the americans free kz mauthausen ( sfw ) . 
  war is over . 
  [ 1955  ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/libapps/accounts/2785/images/1955_un_membership_begins_period_of_expansion.jpg ) austria gets voted into the un . 
  rehabilitation after ww2 and being considered an enemy state . 
  [ 1989  ( http://members.aon.at/roemersteinarena/mock&amp;horn27.6.1989.jpg ) foreign ministers alois mock and gyula horn cut the fence between austria and hungary during the pan-european picnic putting an end to the iron curtain . 
  werner faymann reminds me of kermit the frog . 
  horrible . 
  heinz fischer is just extremely slow speaking . 
  [ old , tacky grandpa . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdotqk0ykw0 ) not really a politician , but the austrian dude who goes on a hike with the freaking [ secretary general of the un during new year . 
  ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xat1/t31.0-8/12484623_10153888526738453_5898549903212063967_o.jpg ) i like him . 
  living in china right now . 
  ca n't confirm that they know that we speak german . 
  the only thing they recognize is the city of vienna and the classical music therein . 
  but 9 out of 10 times i just get mistaken as an australian . 
  i do n't even bother anymore . 
  most famous : [ stille nacht , heilige nacht ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9jxatsbywc ) a more regional one ( upper austria ) : [ es wird scho glei dumpa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rowhuwqxdpe ), 
  persecution complex ? 
   everybody can join the free trade area , as long as they implement all the eu requirements . 
  everyone can join the free trade area as long as they fulfill the requirements set in the eea agreement and if they have the goodwill of the other members . 
  austria will have to pump 19 billion in the rescue of a small regional bank alone . 
  seriously , it is n't that much at all when it 's divided by the remaining 27 member states . 
  the ep is n't going to vote on anything unless the commission ( / the member states ) wants them to . 
  also , i do n't see how the eurosceptics ( that are pro free trade at the same time ) have a third of the seats . 
  especially after the british meps left . 
  sure , in theory that could work out . 
  there 'd be tons of people in trade , though , that would lose their job . 
  and that 's a serious problem for irish politicians . 
  oh , not barking at all . 
  but there might be some people out there ( other than you ) who consider voting `` out '' without knowing all of that . 
   no two eea members are alike , but they are n't obliged to implement all eu regulations . 
  the norwegians tend to implement almost all of them , the swiss adopt relatively few . 
  this is the main reason to leave . 
  switzerland is not a member of the eea . 
   `` secessionists '' ? 
  jesus , you make it sound like a cult , not a community of nations . 
  i thought it was the aim of your secessionists to leave that community of nations ? 
   i 've already made up my mind that i 'm voting to stay in the eu , but realistically , excluding the uk from free trade in the aftermath of a brexit would incur significant costs on a lot of countries , in particular ireland . 
  yup , it would be pretty tough on ireland . 
  and i 'm sure that they 'd find a solution . 
  but it will be costly , it 'll take a lot of time and it wo n't be status quo . 
   it would also mean picking up the cost of the uk 's contribution to the eu budget frankly , 11 billion euros is n't a whole lot anyway . 
  that 's not a big concern for the eu . 
   i suppose the exit group have a plan for joining the efta or eea . 
  joining efta would n't grant access to the eea since the term ` efta states ' is defined as `` iceland , the principality of liechtenstein and the kingdom of norway '' . 
  joining the eea directly would require the consent of efta and the eu . 
  good luck with that .
