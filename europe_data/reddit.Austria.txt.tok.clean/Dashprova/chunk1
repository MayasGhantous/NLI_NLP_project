who would pay for the cost of all that ? 
  an imf report from 2013 calling a 2010 recession unavoidable . 
  surely there can be no revisionism there , no special interest . 
  is there any amount at all to finance the many reforms ? 
  some reforms do n't require a lot of money , but most others are very , very costly . 
  it seems disingenuous to force them to do reforms in the space of 3 years while at the same time giving them no money to do them with , while forcing them to cut expenditures . 
  where is the money for reforms going to come from ? 
  are you making a joke here ? 
  hoped to create a global crisis ? 
  as if greece could do anything of the sort . 
  what kind of news have you been reading ? 
  they hoped to get a better deal than the ultimatum that was extended to them and that they could n't in good conscience accept without a mandate from the people . 
  they got that mandate and then turned around and accepted it later , but that was n't because their plans to `` create a global crisis '' failed . 
  it was because their own economy deteriorated very rapidly when they could n't reach a compromise . 
  sure . 
  they are long papers , pdf warning . 
  http://iie.com/publications/wp/wp13-8.pdf http://www.bankofgreece.gr/bogekdoseis/report_on_the_recapitalisation_and_restructuring.pdf https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr1257.pdf  the present values and haircuts presented in table 3 may not be a good estimate of the debt relief received by the greek sovereign , for three reasons . 
  first , as already discussed , from the perspective of a debtor country it may be appropriate to apply a discount rate that reflects expected future borrowing rates over the lifetime of the new bonds , rather than the yields prevailing immediately after a debt exchange . 
  second , greece borrowed the quasi-cash portion of the `` psi consideration '' ( $ 29.7 billion in short term efsf notes ) from the efsf . 
  as a long-term liability with relatively low interest rates ( namely , the funding costs of the efsf plus a small mark-up ) , its present value can be expected to be lower than the value of the efsf notes to investors ( except at very low discount rates ) . 
  third , greece borrowed $ 25 billion from the efsf to compensate greek banks for psi related losses . 
  the present value of this restructuring related liability must be taken into account when computing the overall debt relief . 
  also the need for recapitalization here by the interim pm of greece : http://www.grreporter.info/en/record_losses_28_billion_euro_banks_after_their_involvement_psi/6635 and by another good source that summarizes different findings and which concludes that greek banks were the ones to mostly take the hit in 2012 : http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6013.html, 
  maybe this time try to make someone else take a debt haircut instead of greek banks and greek pension funds that just reflect the haircut loss into greek society . 
  for example the greek banks who took the haircut had to be recapitalised by greek state funds to the tune of $ 50bn , which made the whole exercise rather pointless . 
  because the debt got reduced in 2012 from the haircut and got increased again in 2013 because of the recapitalization . 
   it makes no sense to haircut public debt to private bondholders if the private banks , that hold much of that debt , are to be recapitalised with funds that the government will have to borrow from the esm . 
  this smacks of a ` revolving doors ' process for public debt , as proven in the case of greece where the psi reduced debt in 2012 by 13.4 % only to boost it again in 2013 by 19.3 % -- as the recapitalisation funds were borrowed by the state to compensate the banks for their ... psi losses . 
  it 's not exactly proportional because there is no formula , it has been set by treaty to roughly reflect population sizes in a degressively proportional manner ( where smaller states have more seats than their population would normally grant them ) . 
  actually , it can pass through esm at 85 % agreement . 
  finland can be circumvented . 
  [ you can find a table with vote percentages here . 
  ] ( http://www.esm.europa.eu/about/governance/shareholders/index.htm ), 
  wow , that 's exactly what he 's * not * proposing . 
  more debt is what europe has been doing with greece , and it has led nowhere . 
  [ he 's even used those expressions himself to describe the european policy when it comes to greece . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/opinion/krugman-kick-that-can.html ), 
  that was precisely my point . 
  to claim finland has the same voting power as germany is simply untrue . 
  eu mp seats are based on population , but participation ( and voting power ) in the financial instruments has to do with gdp . 
  germany absolutely does ** not ** have the same voting power in european matters as finland . 
  where the heck did you base that ? 
  do you know that different countries have different number of seats in the european parliament ? 
  germany has 96 and finland 13 . 
  also different countries have different votes according to their capital in the esm , the ecb , and so on . 
  not anymore i do n't . 
  tone is irrelevant . 
  what , he offended the delicate sensibilities of your politicians by telling them they 're wrong ? 
  that they 've mishandled this crisis ? 
  just the facts for me . 
  and they speak for themselves . 
  getting hang up on ultimately trivial things like that should n't detract from his main points , which are at least worthy of discussion, 
  i think much milder than that . 
  some of us even consider that stance quite extreme , it does n't help at all to resolve the problem . 
  we have had good relationships with greece and very positive state visits in the last few months . 
  austria is very amenable to helping greece . 
  our government said they could even have the vote passed on monday if required . 
  it 's been a constant motif in the past few months . 
  i believe the reasons are that they want to portray them as not having any ideas at all , with the subtext that there are no ideas other than those pushed by all the ruling parties in europe which are mostly rightwing and thus follow rightwing economics . 
  i seem to remember varoufakis has always published his proposals on his blog as a testament to the need for transparency every time he was accused of not having any proposals . 
  i remember one time they were accused of that even the greek government published their folder of proposals which was 50 pages . 
  so i think it goes to the same narrative . 
  they bring proposals that are n't what the insitutions want , they take one look at them and say `` you do n't have any realistic proposals '' which lately has evolved into `` you do n't have any proposals '' . 
  perhaps because the uk is a financial centre so banks ca n't up and leave , but if they get taxed too severely in other places they might move assets and relocate to less-taxed places ? 
  i 'm not sure . 
  i believe the [ ecb loan repayments which are more short term and with relatively high interest ( ~ 4-6 % ) is the acute problem . 
  ] ( http://graphics.wsj.com/greece-debt-timeline/ ) i do n't think the efsf loans are problematic . 
  by the way i ca n't access your article , it 's behind a paywall . 
  this is obviously a caricature , but there are all kinds of inflammatory and very negative articles about greece in the german press constantly that do shape public perception . 
  that 's not a source , that 's a narrative ... greece has n't defaulted since the great depression . 
  did you read the source i provided ? 
  it provides average retirement ages as well as actual ones . 
  actual retirement ages are obviously lower than nominal ones , but that is the case for most countries , including almost all european ones . 
  please provide a source for that claim . 
  greek men on average retire just as late as the germans . 
  the retirement age is 65 , like most countries of the eurozone . 
  [ oecd source . 
  ] ( https://www.oecd.org/els/emp/ageingandemploymentpolicies-statisticsonaverageeffectiveageofretirement.htm ), 
  you 've obviously did n't read a thing i provided . 
  i 'm not arguing it . 
  there 's nobel - laureate economists who are arguing it . 
  but even if nobody was arguing it : there are ** tons ** of countries who run consistent budget deficits , on occasion quite large . 
  i 've just told you of one : the united states . 
  there are many others . 
  the uk . 
  japan . 
  brazil . 
  hungary . 
  india . 
  the philippines . 
  [ go have a look . 
  ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/gc.bal.cash.gd.zs/countries/1w?page=4&amp;display=default ) or , if you 'd like to look at the last few years , here you go : [ convenient oecd source ] ( http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/download/190200211e1t008.pdf?expires=1434678466&amp;id=id&amp;accname=freecontent&amp;checksum=19b12c3cb13a0ef97af5213d68d1fe94 ) . 
  from there you can see that ** in fact the oecd average has been running a budget deficit * over 5 % * for the last 6 years . 
  ** among them countries like uk , usa , japan , ireland , portugal , slovenia , spain , the list goes on . 
  you persist in the notion that this is some special case of the greeks mismanaging their economy - once again , by taking one economic index and considering it * in vacuo * . 
  there is no single budgetary strategy that can be considered without taking into account everything else about the economy - its size , its type , its needs , its regional and epochal fluctuations . 
  there has been mismanagement , of that there can be no doubt , but of the kind that 's more common than dirt in the world , and in no way special to greece . 
  i 'm sorry , but if you insist on calling * me * ideologically prejudiced but at the same time keep proving you do n't know anything about economics yourself but are instead arguing from heaven knows what impulse , then i 'll discontinue this discussion . 
  this would be funny if it were n't so sad . 
  you latch on to one economic indicator , out of context and * in vacuo * , as if it captures the whole economy , but you just reveal to everyone with a rudimentary knowledge of economics that you do n't know what the hell you are talking about .
