it 's far from a majority yes , i missed to point this out specifically . 
  basically i think i share your opinion . 
  i just wanted to focus on this specific rumor and shed some light on the background . 
  i called them separationists , not `` freedom fighters '' . 
  and in the shadow of russian atrocities i think it remains highly relevant to keep a critical view of all sides . 
  and you do n't help the ukraine ignoring the problems that make up the complex sociology of the maidan happenings . 
  a desirable democratic government of the ukraine needs to maintain awareness towards nationalistic movements even in peace-time , not to mention war-time . 
  no country is safe from the fascist threat , which does especially also not exclude russia , which currently does in my austrian view nothing else than hitler with his [ ** `` heim-ins-reich '' ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heim_ins_reich ) - ideologie . 
  extreme right-wing parties rising . 
  not to forget opus dei . 
   the us is a more unequal country ( the properly adjusted gini is some 0.38 there , to 0.33 for us ) meaning that the rich are taking a larger portion of that national income . 
  so this is not a measure of median incomes and living standards, 
  freedom !, 
  seems to look very similar to a clear night view of europe with all the lights . 
  i kindly invite you to north korea so you can investigate some differences , 
  too many communist unions , 
  our army ( austria ) uses the hedgehog and i like it . 
   ~ ~ mozart was viennese ~ ~ beethoven was austrian at least that 's how i heard it frequently . 
   largest terrorist training camp in europe i 'm sorry , but you ca n't compete with the german bnd in that matter . 
  you may find some of it on youtube , i have seen 3 docus about the nsu-case and almost half a dozen some years ago about the raf . 
  as i recall they were mainly produced by zdf or arte . 
  they were sent on 3sat , phoenix , arte or one of the zdf-channels like neo or info . 
  edit : what you describe , i have n't seen however . 
  mario draghi , president of the european central bank , was vice chairman and managing director of goldman sachs international from 2002 -- 2005 . 
  of course many in europe are anything but happy about such a guy working with very very limited democratic control over the ecb !, 
  other than that , yes , i would love much more direct democracy , maybe switzerland as an example . 
  luckily there were some documentaries on german tv channels recently with a shitload of proof that it 's systemic and not exceptional . 
  edit : however let me add , that it is n't really an attempt to spread nazi-ideology !, 
  in the light of findings about the raf-cases , which also only came to public a few years ago , the bnd has a good tradition of so called false flag activities . 
  a lot of insiders said , that in a democracy you need such tools to build up a modern police force . 
   which is very welcoming at the surface , but ... 
  i think i know what you 're at , but i think that 's the same all over europe . 
  at least that 's an impression i personally got from north to south and from east to west . 
  that is of course correct . 
  but it seems in the light of recent failures around the nsu-case in the article , that the bnd has some kind of tradition . 
  it 's not that easy . 
  the buddies of our billionaires in the western money world are n't directly financing those radicals . 
  osama bin laden for instance was evicted from saudi arabia at a certain time . 
  these guys are the losers within their abnormal rich societies . 
  and turn their remaining money against the buddies of their winning fellows . 
  the enormous amount of money makes an inner saudi conflict between winners and losers of their crazy system such a big international problem ( starting with 911 if you wish ) . 
   do n't shy away from astroturfing social media to influence public opinion . 
  what makes / r/europe outstanding is that here at least there is a strong intelligent opposition to them , sadly there are too many other topics where that is n't the case as much elsewhere on reddit . 
  environmental law , health ... 
  almost every part of society is affected but no open discussion allowed . 
  then the same `` wise power-junkies '' come out to say , `` the public can not decide , it does n't understand because it 's not educated enough '' . 
  what a perfect way to provide education keeping everything secret :(, 
  that 's not the point , the point is , whether business ( systemic dictatorship of a minority ) should rule or democracy , the majority of people that is . 
   business cares for money ** only ** . 
  it 's amazing how many people believe religion-like in money ( power of the wealthy ) while ignoring the higher value of almost everything else in the universe . 
  it 's a drug , i call them power-junkies . 
  sacrificing all kinds of humanitarian values up to the biological environment we live in - for their addiction only . 
  and it 's destructive as any known hard drug . 
  i do n't really know , i guess the uks foreign policy in the near east since the time of colonization plays a major role here . 
  in germany they were hunting muslim extremists so much , they totally ignored the nazi-terrorists  spain has no colonial history in the near east and france colonized islamic countries but seems still to have a slightly better reputation there . 
  to many it may be an important additional information , that the german secret service bnd was established after wwii by the us and the uk as kind of official successor of their previous stay-behind troops and manned with those agents . 
  however these were basically selected for being anti-communist . 
  previous forces from the ss and the wehrmacht were perfect for this job . 
  so the german secret service was built up by the us and the uk staffed with nazis , many of whom escaped their punishment for their atrocities in the 3rd reich that way . 
  it 's basically racism . 
  white ( rich ) immigrants are very welcomed everywhere in europe . 
  well we talked about austria , and nazis here sure hate wiesenthal , while the majority hates hitler . 
  facing a similar phenomenon over here in austria many conclude that it 's our xenophobia that leads to a lack of perspectives that these people have within our culture . 
  it 's not that easy and self-explaining how to integrate yourself into a foreign culture also . 
  but what imams and the islamic web have to offer needs really desperate people . 
  and there we have a responsibility for everybody to create a climate of more perspectives for foreigners/immigrants . 
  which is unlikely , because we even make the world a hell for our own people everywhere . 
  we could say either hitler or simon wiesenthal . 
  oh , i thought they had no empty accommodations for the refugees that come over the sea daily , so they need to put them in prison-like camps ... 
  for those who prefer more action i 've heard , suicide by cops in the us also is a bargain . 
  no , i 'm going to teach you about your home-country in your native language !, 
  / s of course !, 
  thanks for providing more insight . 
  even if the article may have a wrong message , readers here can get a better picture . 
  thanks !, 
  we are both living in small countries , austrian here , and foreigners tend to have a limited insight . 
  i think though , we are n't that different . 
  austria also has many very secular people but is still heavily influenced by catholic tradition , which is represented more by the old/conservative side of the population . 
   france is ostensibly a catholic country . 
  as far as i know much more secularist than ireland  there is a very strong `` pro-life '' movement in ireland , largely funded by american protestants . 
  if those american protestants want to influence ireland , they need to work with catholics . 
  we are curious what 's going on in the former colonies . 
  edit : and in austria we felt the same with us stories about the fritzl-case . 
  i 'm living a few miles from that location . 
  a few days later my little brother had his 9th birthday and i gave him an adventure as present : together we went to the boarder which goes through a small forest with my then quite new nissan terrano i and picked up in total 12 eastern german refugees and one dog that wandered around without orientation in the forest and brought them to a nearby camp . 
  we both remember especially the moment when we could tell newly found people that everything was alright , nothing more to fear , they were safe and we would help them find their way . 
  still gives me gooseflesh thinking about it . 
  interesting , since this is the first post of mine in this thread not being a question . 
  thanks for trolling mr. international negotiation master , 
   teenage-political-awakening level claims so that 's what you accuse the topic-article basically to be ? 
  dismissing doubts based on logic as conspiracy theories is a lame attempt to control a discussion . 
  and not answering in detail to any raised question means obviously you have nothing else to contribute . 
  what 's please `` academic '' in blind trust in industries and their lobbies ? 
  it 's simplicity and straightforwardness is appropriate in your view to the number of affected citizens ? 
  have you ever considered the possibility that it was maybe the other way around ? 
  that this was a precondition to allow most major lobby groups and industry sectors to control discussion without an outcry of the public ? 
  is n't it a great contradiction how freedom and concealment are going hand in hand with tipp  ? 
   terrifies them who 's them ? 
  the saudi regime . 
  and other saudi 's were for sure sponsoring al-qaeda .
