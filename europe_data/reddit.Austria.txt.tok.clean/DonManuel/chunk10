   german and austrian companies are overwhelmingly supporting the concept of a highly integrated eu, 
  some alt-right us billionaires and putin 's circle of oligarchs , both representing economical interests that can only win from a weak and eventually collapsing eu . 
  because some very rich and powerful people put a lot of money into nationalistic propaganda for the large stupid bottom of society . 
  that 's the weakness of fascism , they often split into various fraction and then fail to cooperate with someone `` somewhat slightly different '' , since their dream is an irrational homogeneity . 
  now the fascists replaced jews with muslims . 
  much more victims , much less power . 
  also it seems like not only russia is sponsoring european fascists but indeed mossad too . 
  so europe has kind of become a proxy war field for the isreal/muslim conflict . 
  ukraine and belarus were all together lithuania , but 1360 is a while ago . 
  asylum for refugees is a human right declared in the international declaration of human rights . 
  i 'm sure my austrian fellows will in majority join in the welcome . 
  i 'm almost sure that also applies for our german neighbors . 
  sultan news going nuts . 
  maybe better news than relaxed triumph . 
  queen m\u00e1xima , please tell the sultan to care for his own goats . 
  been many times to greece , my first idea here was to recommend a roundtrip around crete . 
  what have clintons even to do with any of those topics ? 
  they 're history , get over it . 
  need another enemy , be honest : it 's nothing less than democracy . 
  well , criminals that know how to behave excellently always have been way more dangerous than those who offend on first sight or expose an uncultivated image . 
  german native speaker here , in german media juncker is continuously ridiculed , but he 's just so much less important than putin - i would even say for europe . 
  that 's why i answered to your putin-hating/not-juncker-bashing statement . 
  you really want to compare the role of putin with that of juncker ? 
  that 's bizarre . 
  or you could just call him a prophetic magician . 
  but he has !, 
  just wait for him citing breitbart , sputnik or rt tomorrow . 
  6 newcastle ? 
   to see a world where these cultures can coexist that 's what i saw to some extent in all those projects . 
  identity can be based on so many different realms . 
  but power ( politics/money ) must be redefined and identity based on the exclusion of others ( religion ) is outdated . 
  then different cultures can coexist without problems . 
  i learned to accept that within my life-time i will not experience an auro-ville with an ideal diversity as you miss it as of today . 
  not to mention a globe with a humanity with that social intelligence . 
  so i enjoy the little things . 
  over 50 nations , i know . 
  an extraordinary place , christiania or findhorn appear `` small '' comparably . 
  in india , sadly not here in europe . 
  but i 've been there ~ 20 years ago . 
  glad to see how nice it developed , was n't sure at that time . 
   i am actually curious what people will call actual fascism when it returns . 
  who ? 
  the blind followers or the critics in jail and concentration camps ? 
  we have a strong fascist party here in austria as many other european nations . 
  they have n't gone away past wwii and it needs constant awareness to keep them from government . 
  authoritarian , nationalistic , religious , oppressing opposition and press , anti-feminist , spreading hate and fear of lbqt people , isolationist , war-mongering . 
  an element or two might miss in the specific case . 
   the truth is that poland is n't descending into some authoritarian morass , or moving backwards toward sovietism . 
  yes , it 's more like contemporary russian , hungarian or turkish fascism . 
   my opinion is that those far right parties are the biggest tools of the system . 
  best example : the trump cabinet, 
  only nationalized banks within democracies could be expected to have obligations towards democracy as such . 
  after trump vladimir seems a bit broke these days . 
  also in germany the afd has financial problems recently . 
  just waiting for our fp\u00d6 for similar news . 
  those europeans who really understand certain elements of us hypocrisy realistically are aware that we are n't any better in europe . 
  those who can and volunteer to list a lot of accusations often have n't reflected and are also wrong often . 
  indeed , the media always hides how russian bombs in syria are basically made of chocolate only . 
  [ ** yes ** ] ( http://www.breakingnews.com/item/2016/12/01/large-fire-burning-at-major-oil-refinery-operated/ ), 
  this is still the dream of many , but nationalism is strong across the globe today . 
  he really did love those 60ies us cars . 
  my point is basically you have no clue but the bigger a mouth . 
  the same could have been said when the us had below 10 mio white colonists inhabiting it . 
   trump wants to help blacks by kicking out mexicans not the first to appeal by playing out minorities against each other . 
  before you stand up for what you believe you could want i guess you should better analyze and learn about the present situation , 
  because there is no globalization of individuals but only of capital and corporations . 
  it would really make sense , if people were free to move where ever they please and all nations would agree on good social standards and the protection of the globe 's environment . 
  if human rights and equality were globalized and the biggest global players put under democratic control . 
  thanks , figured out already he was n't an honest user . 
  bullshit , go home russian troll . 
   he was a democraticly elected pressident of a democraticly and legitematly formed nation . 
  i was wrong , a russian troll !, 
  i suspect you are either an american troll or a badly educated youngster . 
  tito was no democracy . 
  these symbols change for a reason , you went from dictatorship to democracy if i may remind you as northern neighbor from austria . 
  when have you been born btw . ? 
  before or after that happened ? 
   what is this american idiot on about ? 
  what changed in your country 25 . 
  juni 1991 ? 
  there 's a great tradition changing it 's name permanently , the tradition of fundamental religious gun loving white racists , like going back to the kkk . 
  ever heard of the tea party ? 
  dominator, 
  there 's no `` divorce bill '' . 
  but you do n't leave the restaurant without paying open bills . 
  i guess you favor the middle way . 
  environmentalism, 
   national community this is an arbitrary construction , borders changed often . 
  we are a global community , only this will never change . 
  think of scientists that have been a global community since ages . 
  how about global solidarity among humans ? 
  if a large meteorite hits earth we would all be affected . 
  tribal animals were an attempt to understand human groups , but in our interconnected world that explanation has been proven wrong . 
  see my comment about [ ** identity ** ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6b5aqv/viktor_orban_with_some_of_his_best_friends/dhjyiv1/ ) . 
  to be a human on planet earth is a great identity out of zillions of topics we identify with . 
  you identify with a gender , varying age groups throughout your life , your profession , your preferred nutrition habits , your preferred drugs , the region you live in ( which mostly is orders of magnitudes smaller than your `` nation '' ) , your preferred means of transportation , your education level etc. 
  all of that working on a global base , connected worldwide through the web . 
  nationalism is a kind of religious propaganda with no scientific evidence supporting it . 
  except africans we all have a long history out of africa behind us , you find no group of really pure genes . 
  nationalism and religion are the main roots of war , so nonsense .
