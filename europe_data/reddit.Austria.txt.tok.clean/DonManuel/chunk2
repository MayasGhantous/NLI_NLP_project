  so basically we are dealing with an inner-saudi conflict that is spreading over the world - not the whole thing , but a large part of it . 
  what about a pan-european democratic decision process ? 
  why should we be so incapable as european people to vote for decisions compared to the real life outcome of our foreign ministers combined ? 
   she still did better than expected absolutely !, 
  i also tend to see the glass half full instead of half empty , 
  you can break down the same principle to any larger democratic country and ask the same question for all federal states of austria or hungarian counties . 
  i favor the idea , that democracy is stronger , the larger it grows . 
  i trust more in the entirety of the people of europe than in any of our `` leaders '' . 
  well , the ec was actually founded by corporations , but they seem to lose more and more control in favor of democracy . 
  if initially today 's power of the european parliament had been envisioned , i guess , many power-junkies would have preferred not to found the ec . 
  that 's why *** we *** need also to take more responsibility and articulate our preferences from now on . 
  i think  ashton was a tragedy or a joke or both because  there is no such thing as a common foreign policy just alliances . 
  it makes me sad , that so many europeans love their nations as separate entities more than europe to unite . 
  communists !, 
  i wonder what his theories about mh-370 are ? 
  oh yes , i loved most about the case , that all utilities that run nuclear plants offered to give them for free to the nation ( taxpayer ) including withdrawing said accusal . 
  argentine is a great example of the consequences . 
  i 've heard that assumption , also in russia you find g.a.s.h. 
  right , but there are also muslim extremists who are n't funded by saudis . 
   bigot as in believing in any ideology instead of understanding science ? 
  * you * sure know about the vatican observatory , 
  http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/la_mort_aux_juifs_%28loiret%29 please translate this french version , the english is very short only . 
  so there is some probability the name refers to a pogrom and could be seen as remembrance place as auschwitz that way . 
  same could be said about gay nazis or catholic child molesters . 
   his muslim mates i think them in europe are meant with `` to europe '' . 
  i can understand it from that angle of view too . 
  i just picked them as an example for heavily suppressed groups . 
  it 's one step after the other . 
  i would n't be surprised , if islam ( who started ~ 700 years later ) will eventually have taken a much shorter time than christianity to evolve towards equal rights for women and homosexuals . 
  socially the culture of islam is still terribly retarded , but i feel as they evolve even quicker than christians today . 
  i 'm saying this as a fundamental atheist though , hoping , that also there the scientific enlightenment will even spread quicker . 
  you are too busy doing reddit aside your responsible job , 
  he probably cited neville chamberlain , 
   first victim of war is truth . 
  allegedly us senator hiram warren johnson ( 1918 ), 
  indocanadians ? 
  what 's that ? 
  but this is no sensation ... 
  a great map of environmental foresight , love for risk , and democratic participation !, 
  just wait for [ ** quant-e ** ] ( http://www.autobild.de/artikel/quant-e-sportlimousine-autosalon-genf-2014-4547426.html ) , 77 % will be nothing . 
  you could attack my generalization even more referring to switzerland or norway , which are only very rich but no island and have similar problems understanding that europe needs to unite . 
  other than that , of course countries were easier to be persuaded to reduce their nationalism and integrate into a larger community when they were economically weaker . 
  islands as such play a minor role though , here i agree , i should have focused on wealth only . 
  neither ireland nor malta come near to the wealth of the uk . 
  and talking about wealth of cyprus is as talking about the social competence they show with their split island . 
  the uk can not leave europe , only the ec . 
  island people and rich people have a bit more problems to accept to be part of something bigger , to show an advanced social behavior . 
  but nobody can stop evolution . 
   technology these days is cool wolves are even cooler , 
  let us remember : public backlash is not irrelevant !, 
  i would say it really depends on the american . 
  `` american '' is just not specific enough to answer that question . 
  though most will find at least some places where they are welcome . 
  oops , i mixed up submission and article !, 
  yes , now i also saw the article gone . 
  probably the city did n't like it . 
  edit : they seem to have replaced it with this : http://www.yourmoney.com/your-money/news/2358006/new-ffrees-campaign-to-get-britain-saving, 
  i still see it on the new-page on about position 85 ( also when not logged in ) . 
  so i think it only has n't been upvoted enough to remain a bit at the frontpage . 
  still i also wonder why / r/europe did n't like that article more . 
  `` consumer protection from media content '' = = `` propagandist censorship '', 
  religious freedumb is the freedom to incite and organize mass psychosis . 
  we are not going to join the us with that medieval nostalgy , since neither we need scientology nor a majority believing in creationism . 
  i referred to your view , not your nation , with the term of innocence . 
  if you talk with many social layers of many countries , you would n't have such a naive hope . 
  all nations have a culture of nationalism where personal value and identity is defined by others being lower . 
  nationalism where an attitude of brotherhood or at least friendship towards other nations dominates does n't exist . 
  now the younger generations show abilities to find other ways to define value and identity . 
  this may evolve but it will not take decades , it will take centuries . 
  and during that time no bigger war may break out . 
  as long as wars happen in this world , the fire of hate can not be extinguished . 
  basically your view appears to me full of naivety and innocence , but on a second thought i realize that it 's even difficult to explain why hate does n't stop aside of the difficulty to understand the whole history . 
  i think we can see a prime example how it could work between germany/austria and israel . 
  even the current troubles down there can basically not disturb this relations because germany and austria officially admitted their guilt and did some kind of reparation . 
  of course you find the enemies here and there still , but it does n't look like they were successful in dividing those nations again . 
  as others indicate here too : the official admittance of guilt is always a necessary precondition . 
  it 's not so absurd if you still benefit in your generation from any kind of resources that were stolen by your ancestors . 
   price dumping on labour costs is what this is , and nothing else . 
  on top of the blatant sexism that is . 
  sadly i have to agree . 
  i think you are referring more to real life prejudices than actually the active users of this sub . 
  this may have been how this was perceived abroad , but actually it was completely different . 
  we did n't decide whether women should be conscripted or not . 
  we had polls if conscription as such would be abolished or not . 
  then people were made to believe that without conscription and since also the civil service would disappear that there would n't be enough money for all that civil work that had been so cheap over all the years . 
  austrians decided in a very strange way therefore , but the motivation which you describe , though also very human , plaid a minor role only . 
  well , i hope the romanian people profit more than austrian investors . 
  the more i feel sorry having misunderstood you . 
  sorry to mix you both , so let me rephrase : does n't that refute the point i was referring to ? 
  does n't that refute your point ? 
  the first ships of a joined eu army ? ( ! ), 
  the eu and ukraine share a boarder in hungary , just saying . 
  well , you focus on markets , i did on education . 
  i think education is even more basic . 
   inequality yes , in austria i also perceive it as an affirmative action . 
  as austrian and net-payer in the eu i support the support romania gets . 
  if i was born there i would expect it from rich europe too . 
  especially to reduce or stop the brain drain , which in itself prolongs this dependency . 
  yes , the wto is the prime example of corporations overruling democracy and therefore a major source of concerns about tipp . 
   acting as if *** it was very likely that *** a free trade agreement created these liabilities is *** not *** a lie,
