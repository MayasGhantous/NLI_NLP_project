  how is `` knowingly flat-out lying '' even possible if nobody really knows what they negotiate . 
  until we know , everybody is entitled to articulate his suspicions . 
  everything is justified that finally helps to make the negotiations public . 
  the influence of vested interests ca n't be bigger , if no public democratic control is present . 
   more unsubstantiated claims that dont relate to ttip or even free trade agreements in general . 
  full public disclosure and problem solved . 
   gerrymandering til , thanks !, 
  but why do you trust more in some secretely negotiating elite circles and fight against everybody who wants to check for himself ? 
  and everybody can guess from my honestly taken flair why . 
   more disturbing is that currently party # 2 is jobbik . 
  indeed frightening . 
  i saw some of them accidently on a kind of parade at sopron ( love the market there ) , better left quickly on first sight  edit : also i think jobbik is kind of a force driving people to orban for fear of them, 
  from his english , no , i do n't think so . 
  even teabaggers write better . 
  but do n't forget that many from the former east-block hated their previous systems so much that today they are found all over the conservative spectrum up to the far right as eg [ ** jobbik ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jobbik ) in hungary . 
  fears of the unknown are no rational argument . 
  so i need to know before i can tell you . 
  but from what has leaked already i suspect most that standards should be lowered and corporations empowered . 
  no need for this . 
  oh , yesterday you were calling it [ ** anti-american ** ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2cbep4/european_ombudsman_asks_council_and_commission_to/cjdtfdb ) and did n't answer why public disclosure of such information in a democracy was anti-american . 
  but you insist opposing opposition to secret tipp negotiations , why ? 
  i 'm living in austria close to the hungarian boarder , so we are also more aware of hungarian news . 
  we learned how orban changed the voting districts to intelligently create an artificial majority in various deciding districts ( splitting other districts where the opposition was stronger ) . 
  at which percentage would you think those tricks also stop working ? 
  is this already a kind of explanation for the popularity of orban ? 
  that enough people believe he could do something about this discrepancy ? 
  one day i 'd like to read a sociological study concerning the points you raise . 
  other than that i could only come up with dozens of anecdotal evidences for what you describe . 
  please be more precise , what 's exactly anti-american in that request for publication ? 
  is democracy , public disclosure of anything affecting the public , now something anti-american ? 
  if it was good for the majority why negotiate secretely and imply any mechanisms that undermine democracy ? 
   would be good on the long run for them too ... not for the industrial lobbies negotiating tipp though , only for the people of the us , but they do n't count . 
  only because machiavelli works , he does n't represent the only true opportunities . 
  sounds a bit more credible than the iphone-pic from a mh370 passenger on diego garcia . 
   i still do n't see the similarity . 
  i can live with that , 
  exactly !, 
  that 's why i instantly focused on france in my other posting here . 
  you may be correct with your last sentence , but this is still quite remarkable to me , regarding the extreme armament of greece ( per capita spendings ) and turkey who both are big enemies but both part of the nato . 
  i see weapons business overruling politics in the eu . 
  somehow these french ships remind me of the german submarine deal with greece right before greece had to be bailed out . 
   gsm standard specifies that mobile devices must be able to be turned on by the network . 
  i 'd love to see better proof for this !, 
  also it 's funny how korea is always near the top . 
  everybody knows how their military drill in school kills any creativity ... 
  i 've heard that a few times , but why exactly ? 
  are there devices around that have been shown to still stay somehow alive ? 
  we should organize and offer a eu sponsored seminar presenting and explaining the off-button , 
  yes , i am even suspecting it is n't so random at all but low performers are intentionally selected in order to raise funding for education . 
  seems more like a secret complicated game to me than a true survey . 
  as long as they still exist , people should not forget : there is still an off-button , 
  for us austrians this graph is way nicer than our pisa-ranking ... 
  front national : 25 % what should we expect ? 
  would you think , when we are really talking about europe , that the new york times or similar us publications would n't also be kind of biased ? 
  should us papers also not be submitted to / r/europe ? 
  ca n't be child abuse , must be something supranatural !, 
  your hate is big , your arguments@topic still missing . 
  also any evidence how the author was such a `` lunatic liar '' . 
  and ? 
  why should a source with a bias not publish valid points ? 
  your arguments@topic are ? 
   i never read the article so you admit to basically mere trolling . 
  it 's about power generation , not weapons , but most probably most downvoters did n't read more than the title , as you ... 
  oligarchs are no revolutionaries as of changing the structure of society . 
  they may change the capo and strategies but they will leave basic structures unchanged . 
  well , they are called roma over here , but the political right has no problem to bait them as if they were called gypsies . 
  but i also wonder why we have no openness towards a nomadic lifestyle . 
  almost too good to be true if it went that easy ... 
   he was just put against a wall and shot . 
  not particularly cruel imo . 
  well , capital punishment without a trial seems primitive and brutal enough to me . 
  was not like gadaffi or mussolini , ok .  how would that happen ? 
  what distinctive parts of gypsy culture can be preserved ? 
  language , history , music , arts ... come to burgenland/austria and meet [ ** burgenlandroma ** ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgenlandroma ) to learn how integration and preservation of culture could work . 
  i think there are of course laws that make sense only locally , but most realms from the environment over financial markets up to human rights allow to divide and rule from outside if we have the possibility only for different laws . 
  and this is constantly happening , whether by the us , russia or china . 
  asking for a pan-european democracy is a little different from asking for a dictatorship across german speaking countries . 
  exactly what i thought when posting it !, 
  the idea is not to create a super powerful `` government '' of whatever kind but a super powerful democracy . 
  you only end up with oligarchy if no real democracy is implemented but some kind of delegation democracy . 
  the latter was necessary pre-internet , but can be abandoned now step by step . 
   in your opinion is it wrong to ask and study questions such as `` are people of ethnicity x smarter than people of ethnicity y when adjusting for environmental effects ? '' ? 
  yes , humanity as a whole is not developed enough to ask such questions , we need to learn other things first . 
  there have been unlimited opportunities how to punish ceausescu . 
  if he had served life in prison you could argue , he could have spent more time in his life experiencing being at the bottom instead of the top . 
  if people just kill to take revenge , they show a very underdeveloped consciousness . 
  the higher developed ones will react with fear . 
   we do n't know . 
  if you want to know , you know . 
  where i live , burgenland/austria , i am glad that many survived the nazis . 
  they are allowed to be different and respected for their individual culture . 
  today . 
  it took a while to reach that level after nazism , when they were pursued as the jews . 
  a long time they just survived in some kind of ghettos . 
  but the integration is possible and easy if everybody wants and today they get academic degrees as everybody else . 
  also , in 21st century if they are allowed to settle somewhere with dignity , they do n't have no genetic defined nomadism . 
  so in direct contact and with friends among them today i would regard it as a shame to only think about researching on their genes in order to determine any kind of `` cultural weakness '' or whatever other negative or only comparing attribute . 
  i think the eu should become united as the united states of america . 
  i would love to see my country of austria as just a federal state within this greater union . 
  as austrian let me explain how my view of romania developed .
