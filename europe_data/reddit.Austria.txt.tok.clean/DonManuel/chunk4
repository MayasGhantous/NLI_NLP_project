  first there was ceausescu and sekuritate . 
  it seemed like the most evil of places and the poorest people living there , as north korea almost . 
  later in life i came to the conclusion that even the worst dictatorship is a democracy of non-revolution , as ceausescu was killed in the most primitive and brutal way . 
  now why romania still has such a bad image is basically fear . 
  fear of a people that allowed once a ceausescu to happen and to work within a sekuritate against the own people . 
  your political class also does not reduce this fear , corruption and primitivity seem to dominate . 
  finally our right wing people in the rich north/west need a concept of the enemy , and they have an instinct to build upon said fears . 
  that said , romania could also be the first european country to fully integrate the gypsy culture and stand as an example for the rest of us . 
  but anyway , it will take a long time to eliminate the heritage of ceausescu , it is still present in so many hidden ways . 
  i am white and speak german for first language . 
  my grandmother has been raped by russians after wwii and i suspect some gypsies to have stolen a bicycle from my garden . 
  but i would rather let a gypsy manage my finances and a russian protect my sisters if you are the alternative . 
  you literally game away your human rights and any dignity with this posting - shame for my white skin you are . 
  yes , i hope / r/europe does n't sink the submission , since this really is affecting many europeans . 
  whenever you want to fight big corporations as an average citizen you need to unite with others . 
  i call such a union a government and i fight against corruption and for democracy within that government . 
  i see no alternatives . 
  i would prefer not to need to defend my few acres of property against the wishes of a multinational , i am glad there is a government that may still have the power to do so . 
  here in europe we still manage very well to limit monsanto 's activities , *** via *** government . 
  glad to know , there are some like you , 
   churchill did n't want the uk to be part of a supranational organization wait , the uno , the nato are no supranational organizations ? 
  now they need to buy officials , we still have the opportunity to ( re ) claim democracy , that is officials representing the people and punished for corruption . 
  but if there are no officials at all , who is going to stop corporations from doing what they want ? 
  if today even governments seem to be too weak ( occasionally ) , how should weaker governments be stronger ? 
  i also do not want our european corporations to be allowed to overrule any foreign democracy with their economic power only . 
   as usual , it 's appalling to see obama presiding over this . 
  i understand , but obama is no revolutionary . 
  he still did his best to improve evolution i suppose . 
  i love most that corporations will be suing governments for any kind of regulations that only threatened wins of that corporation . 
  no country and even hardly the eu will be able to afford environmental and health protection any more , because all those regulations could endanger corporation 's wins . 
  and this is no theory , exactly that happens in hundreds of cases at the wto yet . 
  i think it 's just an emancipation from certain us controls leading back to wwii . 
  germany and the eu will never get closer to russia than to the us but become more of a `` independent third player '' . 
  how did you find out so quickly ? 
  state jobs as in communism ? 
  do you know that russia is no communistic dictatorship anymore ? 
  it 's an oligarchy with high unemployment rates and a majority turning back to subsistence economy . 
  the idea of 149 mio doing nothing except taking money from government for sitting around has nothing to do with the reality of the majority today . 
  most russians would answer , `` if only ... !, 
  '' , but this is referring to old times of communism , some decades ago , not today . 
  that 's why so many wish those times back and even praise stalin forgetting about a death toll of 20mio . 
  russia is hell but a different one than painted in that article . 
  why is this posted in / r/europe ? 
  this is a very us based view with a lot of completely outdated information . 
  i love my country of austria and i love europe . 
  but there 's a lot of truth in that american 's view of us . 
  let 's start with subscriber numbers of / r/europe relative to the rest of reddit ... 
  [ ** partii inuit dismissed from greenland 's government for not supporting proposed lifting of zero-tolerance uranium policy ** ] ( http://www.wise-uranium.org/ureg.html#glztp ), 
  both are dramatic options . 
  it 's really amazing to me how unstable the world appears today as in comparison to my childhood in the 6oies . 
  even more intense due to the grown scientific foresight and the public availability of information ( web ) . 
  i 'm impressed austria beats switzerland by an order of magnitude :o, 
  i wonder if sea level rise due to climate change might slow this down or even prevent it from happening . 
  i said serious media in german . 
  / r/de is german for german discussions about germany . 
  if you understood german , you could watch the [ ** first german national tv channel ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soyyyognnmg ) reporting about it . 
  in english i found only this source telling the same . 
  so much for the lack of credibility of globalresearch in general . 
  no conspiracy . 
  official broadcast in germany . 
  you find it in many variations on / r/de from serious media . 
  searching for an english source there 's not so many . 
  [ ** example . 
  ** ] ( http://www.globalresearch.ca/german-secret-service-implicated-in-fascist-murders/5396262 ), 
  if the german secret services had not built that scene up , this radical minority would n't even exist in that dimension in germany . 
  the average education of the majority in germany is sufficient to just make a majority embarrassed from such atrocities . 
  brussels knows this . 
  so the scandal has actually another quality than you assume . 
  so why are n't they going to bucharest to get one of the nice jobs there ? 
  that 's probably the reason so many try to work in richer eu countries ? 
  ever looked at it from the other side : if you are as poor to live in a sewer , how much would you care for laws ? 
  `` raided '' ... that 's when police has to solve problems it is absolutely incapable of . 
  these poor people deserve help , not punishment . 
   be paid for by others through compulsory contributions that 's the idea of a social system . 
  of course that 's a lot more precise . 
  but excuse someone of outside to address simply `` portugal '' , in the long term a democratic majority will also enforce its will . 
   as long as it is covered by the insurance this is exactly not happening with this bill . 
  sad how portugal still believes in oppressing women . 
  if they only wanted to make it easier for women to keep their babies , completely other measures have shown success , see secular liberal france . 
  totally unrelated , but you are aware that 9/11 was done by a cell that originated in germany ? 
  so much for the meaningfulness of a plain growth figure . 
  forced democracy never works , must come from the people . 
  arming their dictators does n't help the case however . 
   i believe you 're trying to imply that communism and christianity share some characteristics such as indoctrination and dogmatism . 
  now i understand some of my downvotes better , thank you , but that 's a misunderstanding . 
  i meant both share some positive values about e.g. 
  social justice . 
  i agree , but if you reduced it to the intersecting set of values with communism , something would come out that i would call social common sense . 
  if you leave out god , communism and christianity have a lot in common . 
  it 's true for 99 % of the gmo market . 
  the rest are fig leaves for pr . 
  as the patents for golden rice have been bought and are controlled now by the bill gates foundation . 
  which causes cancer if we chose to believe the who . 
  then we would need to break the dominance of agro business over science . 
  the corporate goals are n't to feed the world but maximizing profits . 
  but what is produced and sold as gmo today has basically just two `` improvements '' : either glyphosate tolerance or bt production by the plant . 
  there are absolutely no nutritional , health or environmental benefits , just a terrible technocratic business model which does n't care at all for any sustainability . 
  instead the maximum dependency of farmers from one corporation is the aim . 
  [ ** it has been estimated that of the money lent to greece more than three-quarters went into paying off existing creditors and less than 10 % in supporting citizens through the shock adjustment .
