  most of the money given to greece never reached the greek but went straight back to foreign debtees . 
  ~ ~ most ~ ~ ^ * a big part of greek debt is already only [ ** compound interest ** ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compound_interest ) . 
  greece has become a mere object of the global financial casino , and the greek are expected to pay for the games .

  one political project ? 
  it 's at least 27 political projects , which is the problem . 
  i think the unification is great , but we still have a long way to go until we do n't lose too much energy with conflicts among each other . 
  also : i would miss greece :(, 
  this should be the top post on the topic . 
  but mobbing the lazy greeks seems to make more sense for most on reddit . 
  i hope you are correct . 
  but one should n't forget many cultural affinities between russia and greece , most important probably the religion . 
  and the pride of the greek , which will not allow too big a feeling of humiliation . 
  nonsense , some idiots promote a referendum with no chance whatsoever . 
  turkey does not own the kurdish people . 
  the more impressive is the german solar pv electricity production . 
   education i beg to extend it to science . 
  many democracies forgot their responsibility and have left financing too much to corporations , thus giving away science to profit driven decisions . 
  the idea of europe `` accepting '' refugees is wrong . 
  basically europe lets hundreds of them die in the mediterranean and those who make it to the shore are n't immediately sent back from where they fled but treated a little bit better than many animals , worse than most pets however . 
  so they are here . 
  and for a reason . 
  nobody risks his life that way just to `` improve economically '' . 
  that 's a myth . 
  every country in europe where a society agrees to ignore the problem , closing boarders etc. 
  is acting inhumane . 
  i do n't exclude my home country of austria from my criticism , but at least we have tens of thousands already here and - contrary to most media - most of them are treated humanely and are well . 
  most probably . 
  the refugees however will continue to produce facts because they will move somewhere . 
  if you talk to refugees they have clear priorities where they prefer to end up . 
  it can be seen in the current distribution across europe . 
  i have no idea , if it would really work to distribute them to other countries than them wanting . 
  they are humans , they have almost nothing to lose , they break every law just to save their lives !, 
  a completely different welcoming culture is required if you really want to get some control through trust over these people . 
  i think that may work in this 10 % democracy as i regard the representational system implied today . 
  i do n't think the swiss would support their democracy in its current form any longer , if they were all forced to vote in each of the polls . 
  as i ca n't recall any non violent smooth revolution i prefer an evolutionary approach in small steps . 
  administrative institutions are necessary and could be ruled democratically as well . 
  think of the funny media format that gets popular nowadays , where all kind of desktop aristocrats are remotely operating a real life person doing something , e.g. 
  a region in germany even adopted already liquid democracy . 
  but next to nobody participates . 
  that 's the real problem .

   our politicians do n't believe in democracy . 
  i 'm not sure if they believe less than majority of the population . 
  so if a majority still sticks to authoritarian idea ( l ) s it could even be called democratic to be authoritarian . 
  i like to regard dictatorships as the democracy of non-rebellion in that context . 
  we need even more a wider spread of democracy , an interested , informed and responsible public , to back up reasonable policies bottom-up . 
  i do n't believe that much in a top-down system of ruling elites around charismatic leaders any more . 
  but the article of the original submission speaks another language , they are merely negotiating time horizons . 
  feels like you lead back to my op , 
  greece is a country , a nation of people . 
  your argumentation sounds to me like educational measures in kindergarten or primary school . 
  i would have specified , of course i mean both sides . 
  we are talking about a whole nation and even the whole eu . 
  i do n't think investments are automatically `` careless '' . 
  the way from point a to point b is usually a bit longer than the direct connection . 
  i have the impression that the troika forces the impossible shortest way over the mountains , while the greek need to find a more realistic path . 
  i hope you allow putting it in such a metaphoric way , 
  so you trust in the intelligence of the troika ? 
  why are such incapable negotiators allowed to play with whole nations ? 
  if the deadlines really are that urgent , why not nominate intelligent humans ? 
  please address a content with arguments , the website has no priority .

  we have totally free speech for children . 
  growing up also means to learn , that free speech may not be abused . 
  that 's why many europeans regard many americans as pretty childish . 
  yes , 2006 the crisis started , and guess what they did ? 
  send people into early retirement without replacing them with new ones . 
  that 's not `` enjoying retirement '' but forceful reduction of jobs in order to save money , exactly what international investors requested . 
  stupid people always look for simple answers and a clearly identified scapegoat . 
   it 's everybody 's fault except greece . 
  that 's not what the article says .

  alright , thanks for the info !,

  do n't bother too much with the pubertal cry for general free speech with no limits . 
  i think you created some very sophisticated rules - i think either people obey naturally or they just do n't fit in here . 
  no , it 's meant to be sarcastic and says , `` with a few valuable likes this should be enough resistance towards the political right wing ... '', 
  welcome to the social web , where ( stupid ) propaganda is mostly more effective and coordinated than a rational , factual , logical and sober opposition .

  why not ? 
   ca n't wait to see these clowns fail in the most epic way . 
  do n't be too optimistic .

  but maybe i 'm too pessimistic , living in [ ** burgenland/austria ** ] ( https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2014/06/04/aust-j04.html ) . 
  yes . 
  nuclear energy already provides a lot less energy than all renewables together , also the latter are cheaper . 
  so where should we go from here ? 
  wasting money in nuclear to create 20 times ( nuclear is 5 % of global primary energy consumption , of which only 40 % are usable electricity ) the waste per year that we already do ? 
  no , the growth rates of nuclear and renewables compared show clearly where we are heading . 
   we do n't have suitable renewables yet .
