  we have them . 
  this is written with 100 % wind electricity ( burgenland/austria ) . 
  germany , at the altitude of canada , produces a significant amount of electricity with pv alone , not talking about their wind . 
  also nobody worries here that we have n't enough storage technologies . 
  i 'm not . 
  my point is that a thermal process ( boiling water ) is losing 60 % energy right at the beginning , thus being never more efficient than 40 % . 
  having no more clever technology is just wasting a precious resource in terms of energy density . 
  it 's like plowing your field with a space-shuttle ( resource wise ) . 
  do not omit  pile nuclear waste to be taken care of for thousands of generations edit : and in case you do n't know , nuclear plants are doing nothing else but boiling water to produce electricity . 
  [ ** the effect of cctv on public safety : research roundup ** ] ( http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/surveillance-cameras-and-crime )  the analysis found that surveillance systems were most effective in parking lots , where their use resulted in a 51 % decrease in crime . 
  systems in other public settings had some effect on crime -- a 7 % decrease in city centers and in public housing communities , and a 23 % drop in public transit systems -- but the results were n't statistically significant . 
  when sorted by country , systems in the united kingdom accounted for the majority of the decrease ; the drop in other countries was insignificant . 
  the study concludes that while surveillance cameras can be effective in specific contexts such as parking lots and public-transit systems , the potential financial and societal costs require greater research . 
  too say the least , i 'm not convinced . 
   catastrophically stupid a majority of germans considers catastrophically stupid to pile nuclear waste to be taken care of for thousands of generations , in order to boil water . 
   please argue exactly what i 'm refusing , i just stated my personal preference . 
  why not ? 
   it would be better for the usa and the world to change to the british way . 
  agreed , as long as we 're only talking about arming policemen , 
  i guess not only domestically but that also the nra lobbies a lot . 
  the us as another english propaganda world , full of guns , sure must also have an influence . 
   policeman with a gun on his hip is apparently okay i am used to it but i really admire the uk with that !, 
  not that i believed , cctv was helping so much , but i see other surveillance methods doing more harm than cams . 
  it 's great and i would hope others would realize that too , but look around in europe ... 
  police without guns in the uk . 
   the article is clearly biased ( nothing wrong with that ) thanks for staying factual in your posting !, 
  if there was a flair `` opinion '' to be set , i would have used it . 
  but i found the view of the author contributing to the discussion about podemos . 
  you seem to be unable to understand a users overview , but obviously this does n't keep you from making the worst accusations . 
  i 'm no spammer , are you maybe a troll with your new account , using alts for vote manipulation ? 
  i understand that a lot of nationalists , fascists and capitalists will hate this site , but instead of hitting the site , provide your criticism to author and content instead . 
  that 's not what you should communicate if you want to make it work . 
  that 's what you shout to bring up everybody against it . 
  do n't tell me , you 're the only one here talking reality and another view was a dream only . 
  letting people die in the sea , who decided to leave their homes and countries , is also no option . 
  technically , europe has no problem feeding and sheltering a few million refugees . 
  if e.g. 
  jordan survives its current situation , europe can too . 
  it would need to be communicated , that europe suffers because it ca n't feed banks , but it could feed humans easily . 
  nationalism and dictatorship are closer together than many are aware of . 
  also a democratic achievement to overcome nationalism in favor of minorities of all kinds . 
  these bastards are in power because people are only used to dictators and not enough aware of democracy . 
  the whole balkan i would say . 
  i think the quickest solution would be to concentrate on tourism again . 
  luxembourg is a tool to balance the london city . 
  of course they need both to change . 
   london wo n't fall . 
  i think of the ancient rom . 
  a human life time may be not enough , sure . 
  but hubris is deadly . 
  more and more people are starting to understand that war exists economically too , there 's not only the traditional killing with weapons . 
  london still dreams of ruling the world . 
  due to mind and intentions the london city never should have been a part of the ec . 
  that way we just have a thieve in our family . 
  i hope they leave . 
  i ca n't wait to see the london city outside of the ec . 
  never imagined how nice another ice age would be . 
  one of the 2 billion trends right now !, 
  today we know , ceau\u0219escu and nixon had n't such a different mind . 
  yeah , europe needs more of this mutual forgiving !, 
  one of zillions of reasons why the eu needs more not less integration !, 
  because many hungarians who wanted more went abroad - spell brain drain . 
  i am living close to the border to hungary in austria . 
  even before the iron curtain fell , in eastern austria the competition on our job market with hungarians began . 
  in the beginning most spend their money in hungary , later they often settle abroad . 
  [ ** `` icaria : a chapter in the history of communism '' ** ] ( http://archive.org/stream/icariachapterinh00shaw/icariachapterinh00shaw_djvu.txt ), 
  well , i 'm not going to disclose my identity for proof , maybe others made the same experience and share my gratitude . 
  i 've told most of it in my previous sentence anyway , let me add , that extraterritorial `` scientific '' activities of the us in form of some kind of `` institutes '' around the globe are sometimes just camouflaged intelligence offices . 
  who would have thought ? 
  it 's just different if such an information happens to significantly alter your personal history ( especially if you were completely disguised as a child by the time ) . 
  yeah , without wikileaks i would still believe my father was a marine biologist in the early 70ies in northern africa ( where i grew up ) ... 
  thank you wikileaks to help explain history better !, 
   there are reasons to support these deals and reasons to oppose them . 
  but my immediate take is that when the us chamber of commerce makes a huge priority out of complicated deals , and offers an obviously false rationale , you should strongly suspect that there 's bad stuff hidden in the fine print . 
  the rest of the world should be asked , not us self . 
  putin aside , i 've been really impressed about the hate against ( especially environmental or health ngos ) exactly here on reddit , with all its `` science oriented '' `` progressive '' user base . 
  that 's the correct version at least , but it has become an old joke . 
  do n't worry , alitalia is going , so now air france will care more to not lose klm also . 
  i 'm not from france but i know klm very well through close friends working for them . 
  i used `` regarding as '' synonymous to `` comparing with '' , not so different . 
  you can compare to lower or higher levels . 
  i would n't call people `` dumb as fuck '' who prefer the higher comparison . 
  exactly that 's what zimbardo tried to prove . 
   there is no chance he will remain on the force , like it always happens in america . 
  while i believe human rights might be slightly better protected in germany , i ca n't see the real big difference . 
  german police has always been very tough and since decades many regard germany as a `` police state '' . 
  there have been innumerate peaceful protests that were answered with full violence , think e.g. 
  anti-nuclear protests some decades ago . 
   these are exactly the sort of people who should never be allowed to be police officers . 
  as with abu ghraib , do n't blame the individual , blame the system which is rotten top-down . 
  understand the [ ** stanford-prison-experiment ** ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanford_prison_experiment ) to understand , that such a system has the tendency to make the worst out of average people . 
  what are your main reasons to leave saudi arabia and where would you love to go most ? 
  so do you plan a future in saudi arabia with wife , children and another job like your father ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  so you are neither related to any royals nor belonging to the hard working folks from asian muslim countries like pakistan , indonesia or bangladesh . 
  would you regard yourself as part of some kind of middle class therefore ? 
   arab expat so where does your family come from ? 
  stop that fucking military spam on / r/europe !, 
   someone we can both be proud of . 
  absolutely , that 's what we should agree on ,
