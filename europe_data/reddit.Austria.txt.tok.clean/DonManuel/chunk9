  maybe we should found a united human organization to replace the concept of a united nations organization . 
  different nations still allow to divide and rule for multinationals that escaped every democratic . 
  i do n't think the reason is merely more or less capitalism/corporatism . 
  if europe had n't experienced two big destructive wars which the us have n't on its ground , then our inequality level would resemble the us more . 
  anyway we 're still following the us example and inequality is maybe even increasing faster here . 
  yes , we have , but if i told you , how should they remain secret ? 
  yes , made the mistake too , to believe gorbachev represented an evolutionary mental achievement of the majority of russians . 
  obviously he did n't . 
  dream on , 
   i hate to be on the side of kremlin bots like oh , i feel your pain , must be unbearable . 
  and of course , the european governments could really learn a lot from the kremlin how to deal with a kremlin caused refugee crisis . 
  instead of learning from the master , they are just helplessly helping , wtf . 
  never . 
  russia and putin are so poor victims , i can not hit on them too  . 
  actually your `` russia '' i do n't care about , neither about putin , i 'm more sorry for the russian people that they have n't woke up from their dream of a tsar . 
  eventually nobody suffers more of that than themselves . 
  your entertainment level , that is the same prop i expect from the fsb , is nothing minor . 
  first make fire , then put oil into it and later mock bystanders they did n't piss earlier into it . 
  great tactic , 
  crimeans did n't actually flee their country , a majority ( ? ), 
  chose ( ? ), 
  to associate their land and community with another one . 
  other than that going more into details about the crimea is rather ot here . 
  edit : fixed , zozulia is right, 
  it 's really astounding how all the refugees flee to bad germany and nobody is interested to emigrate to the model student of human rights called russia - stupid refugees !, 
  are they now giving asylum for fsm-refugees that are religiously prosecuted in their home country ?

  i can understand how he misses the kgb , the gulags , brainwashing camps and unlimited torture . 
  what a loss . 
  i wonder how lenin 's and stalin 's millions of tortured and deaths feel in the heart ... 
  obviously liking does n't imply any understanding ... 
   next you 're going to tell me that you value mammals more than other animals , or that you value animals over other organisms , or that you value life over inanimate matter . 
  and below inanimate matter : patriots and nationalists . 
  patriotism is outdated in a globalized world . 
  the identification with a country of today on this globe is a stoneage habit that we need to overcome . 
  we must identify as humans and understand what makes us different from apes and what not . 
  patriotism or the identification with a religion lead to the biggest waste of life , time and resources for our human evolution . 
  also patriotism means inbreeding . 
  we must learn to appreciate increased genetic variety , otherwise all humans outside africa will further degenerate on all levels . 
  fuck patriotism . 
  music , inventors and scientists impress me most . 
  only one more day , *** then *** we know if they really have `` no self-control '' and are controlled by `` american angst '' . 
  today this headline is just obsolete . 
  these are the hard numbers , mostly the media refers to electricity only . 
  austria has about ~ 33 % in that graph , while we produce ~ 90 % of electricity renewably . 
   would this be possible in other european countries ? 
  most probably not , people are afraid of envy and mostly for a reason . 
  seems like the best place to be at that time . 
  =  wealth is dangerous, 
  til monaco is about as dangerous as belarus . 
  agreed , austrian here . 
  to me it feels like they 're trying to supply political motivation for the various trade agreements and their supernational courts currently discussed . 
  on both sides . 
  agreed . 
  the loud far right populists in fact drive many more to the left parties than before . 
  while they hurt traditional center right parties the most . 
  because i love arabs , black people and others considered foreign . 
  from a quick search i guess the gap today is somewhere at 100k while the unemployment figure of last year is around 40k , who probably already are in duty as of today . 
  except many were g\u00fclen imams , 
  and those who have still more brain but are children now are secured not to learn the dangerous practice of using this brain . 
  win-win . 
  would be another eu if all member states were able to unite for such a decision . 
  the human mind 's variety is amazing , is n't it ? 
  capable of integrating the wildest contradictions . 
  more like a [ ** gay russian nazi ** ] ( http://www.vice.com/read/meet-russias-gay-aryan-skinheads-finally-bringing-homosexuality-to-the-neo-nazi-world ) . 
  englishmen import their own tea , the german supply has no taste . 
   oh 200 up from 20 daily . 
  yes , thanks , hope to remember it one day forever , german native speaker here , 
   do you want me to remind you austria 's territorial changes during the same time-period ? 
  seems like the term `` losses '' gets interpreted as something depreciatory only . 
  actually i 'm in the generation where we only use it in the sense of `` sorry for your loss '' . 
  using `` looser '' as a contemptuous term has come up as a modern habit which i detest . 
  and yes , of course i know how much austria has lost . 
  do n't start with that one , otherwise we end up realizing how related all those different people actually are , from germany and denmark over the benelux countries and france to britain , how artificial basically the idea of separated countries and cultures in that part of europe . 
  true , but it 's still amazing for me how long it took for human 's cradle of democracy to achieve its current status as a modern independent state . 
  `` gains '' ? 
  looks more like a history of losses to me . 
  no need to go back so long , was n't possible 60 years ago too . 
  do you have an idea about the reasons ? 
  maybe other industrialized nations could learn from it . 
  that 's how austrian airline captains are used to be welcomed at home . 
  austrian here , ( my ) google thinks we are airline captains , 
   fake europeans let 's not forget , by genetics most of them still are europeans . 
  just emigrated generations ago . 
  no , with britain a country left that actually never really wanted to be in . 
  so be it . 
  now we can concentrate even better on a better europe . 
  one true source of shitposting . 
  d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu : the sick men upon the bosporus, 
  reality often beats satire . 
  except when hundreds of thousands of hungarians fled to my area in austria in 1956 ... 
  please explain this conclusion , sounds very weird to me . 
   common sense or rationalism are quite often two very different things . 
  looks like quite some populist right wing folks across europe are opposing ttip in order to gain some momentum . 
  some ! = the i specified below . 
  no , soros tends to invest in intellectual elites , neither in nationalism ( king orban made his university illegal over night therefore ) nor in capitalistic elites since he supports a lot of high level education for the poor . 
  good luck further shifting the scope whenever you have no argument . 
  but must feel really good to be so right while all others fail so big , enjoy , 
  because the eu has more negotiation power towards big players as us , china , india or russia than each of its member states alone . 
  because social and environmental standards across our small continent are better than a inflationary competition towards the bottom among small nations .
