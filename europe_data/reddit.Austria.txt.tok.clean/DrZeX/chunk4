   so i do n't really identify with my skin color because there 's nothing to identify with . 
  that 's exactly what i said though . 
  there is nothing to `` identify '' with , because it 's just that , your skin colour . 
  you 're white , brown , black , or whatever else but you ca n't deny reality . 
  you can say that you do n't care about your skincolour or that it 's not an important part of yourself , but in the end you still possess the skin colour you possess . 
  and in case you do n't understand what i mean , read the conversation i replied to again . 
     white people always need someone to hate i guess . 
    most jews are white . 
   we do n't identify with being white . 
  that person is clearly trying to claim that they are n't white , which is , again , not something you can claim because skin colour is a descriptor based on a physical reality . 
  it 's not in your head . 
   some people treat this characteristic as some proof of being a god race or something and that 's entirely on them and still does n't change the reality we live in . 
  you ca n't not `` identify '' with your skin colour . 
  it 's white or it 's not , there is no `` it 's white but i do n't identify with it '' . 
  skin colour ( e.g. 
  white ) is a descriptor . 
  also , calling the growing anti-semitism a problem produced by neo-nazis only is delusional . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tndccsh_wgu https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/new_antisemitism large parts of the anti-zionist movement today are leftist extremists who are in favour of the muslim `` minority '' in israel which translates into hate against jews in general , especially those who support israel . 
  also : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism_in_europe#in_the_21st_century  this rise in antisemitic attacks is associated on the one hand with the muslim anti-semitism ( described below ) and on the other hand with the rise of far-right political parties as a result of the economic crisis of 2008 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism_in_europe#anti-semitism_within_europe.27s_muslim_population but i am sure you know about this . 
  where did i do that exactly ? 
  so , gay parades in muslim neighborhoods okay or offensive ? 
  ** f ** ire that burns down the whole town and ** u ** ranium bombs that leave ** n ** o survivors . 
   blame men they ** are ** being blamed . 
  for their actions . 
  which they commit due to their idology . 
  you ca n't just say that someone who outright states that they kill for their god , did it because he was a man . 
  that 's pointless and irrelevant . 
  `` what about the men '' is a completely useless argument here , because the reason why people commit terrorist attacks is not simply because they possess a dick . 
  terrorism is an ideologically driven act . 
  it is important to point out the ideology to understand how to work against it in the future . 
  just saying that the terrorist was a guy is meaningless . 
  do you understand this ? 
  b-b-but gun laws !, 
  race : w, 
   i see it at ** my ** university every day . 
  maybe reread his comment . 
  why are you bringing this distinction up when you just provided a link to a statement from a part of the ** german government ** ( that part being [ thomas oppermann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thomas_oppermann ) , current chairman of the spd parliamentary group ) considering to fine facebook if they do not remove certain content ? 
  this is not just about facebook , but about germany as well . 
  it may be the former who wants to remove content in the first place , but it is the latter who wants to fine them if they do not . 
  do you realise this ? 
  or do you simply not perceive governments fining a private company if they do not remove certain content from their website as censorship ? 
  the second image depicts an elementary school class from the netherlands ( not sweden ) . 
  i wonder whatever happened to the idea of secularism in modern europe . 
  that 's just called wishful thinking . 
  that too , is part of the equation . 
  people still do n't seem to understand this every time they bring up the `` but way more people die in car accidents than from terrorism '' line . 
  car accidents happen without intention . 
  nobody * wanted * to kill you . 
  and on top of that , we sign up for those dangers ourselves by choosing to actually get into our cars and putting outselves in danger on the road . 
  terrorism on the other hand , is an act committed with intent and it has unsuspecting , innocent victims . 
  we always saw the risk with driving , and that it could potentially mean our death if we are unlucky , but we decide for ourselves to do it anyways . 
  terrorism is a new risk , a risk the victim can not control in the slightest . 
  you 're totally right of course ; we already have so `` many '' sickos , why not add some more ? 
  if they did n't have economic problems they could pay for some prostitutes , but sadly they have to relieve their sexual frustration through other means . 
  ( by raping children and women for example ) poor poor people :(, 
  true . 
  good talk . 
  you are taking comments made within entirely different contexts and try to relate them as though they were made within the same . 
  un - and under-reported crimes committed by asylum seekers against other asylum seekers are just a part of the whole . 
  not every crime affects natives , but not every crime is committed against non-natives . 
  you could read my comment again and see that bringing up those crimes was not a reply to your initial comment , but made in regards to `` crime rates have not changed by the way '' . 
  it was not made to emphasise how refugees affect native germans negatively . 
  no , it is n't . 
  i do n't know which thread you are reading or which comment chain you followed but we clearly are n't talking about the same topic . 
   `` native germans are affected negatively '' who brought that argument up ? 
  i consider crimes to be crimes no matter who is affected by it . 
  if it 's refugees committing crimes against refugees i have just as much a problem with it . 
   but because the southern countries were incapable and/or unwilling to register them which is why i said `` europe '' and not `` germany '' . 
  is this discussion about germany or austria ? 
  just goes to show how many people live in their own little bubble and project this view on all who look the same . 
  they see and meet a tiny minority of people in an environment which is only available for the absolute best of any category and then expect all others to be the same . 
  it 's like polling university students about their political ideology and then assigning those views to an entire country . 
  people need to stop being so damned naive and actually take a look outside of their safe spaces to get a grasp of reality . 
  thanks for that . 
  easiest way to prove my point : providing statistics . 
  rape is not the only crime which was committed that day , nor are 5 criminals the only ones who should be locked away . 
   this would n't be any different if we threatened to deport these people ? 
  this was a reply to your `` it is not like they would get off without punishment anyways . '', 
  statement , which is factually false . 
   the crime rates have not changed by the way . 
  i already replied to this idiotic argument in another comment in this thread but i 'll explain to you as well why it is just that , idiotic . 
  of course the crime rate has not changed or actually gone down in a country of over 80 million , especially because native germans are less and less likely to commit crimes nowadays . 
  but this argument does not hold any weight in regards to crimes committed by `` refugees '' , because * they do * commit crimes in a rate disproportionately in comparison to native germans . 
  `` official crime statistics '' also ignore ( or rather can not take into account ) un - and under-reported crimes committed in asylum shelters such as sexual assault and rape of children and women as well as the abuse and sexual abuse of gays and trans * people . 
  the only thing that can be taken away from `` crime overall has gone down in germany '' is that germans themselves commit less crimes . 
  this argument does not hold any value or invalidate anyone else 's arguments about crimes committed * specifically * by `` refugees '' . 
  at the end i 'd like to say , i agree with you . 
  deporting actual refugees should not happen ( those who commit crimes should be sitting in jail for it , not sent back to their uncertain deaths in their home countries ) and those who are not eligible for asylum should be deported no matter what . 
  now if only two years ago europe actually showed balls and did n't wave through everyone coming from africa because `` refugees welcome '' and actually checked who the hell those people were ** beforehand ** , we would n't even have this discussion . 
   despite correct . 
  despite in particular . 
  because if it were not for `` refugees '' , crime would be down even more . 
  let 's also not forget the cases which are not or under-reported , happening in asylum shelters . 
  ( e.g. 
  rape and sexual assault of minors , women in general and abuse as well as sexual abuse of gays ) it 's also intellectually dishonest to say `` crime is down in germany '' . 
  of course with germans committing less crimes nowadays , crime statistics show a positive trend , but importing over a million new people who do not follow the same trend and then arguing that there is no problem because `` crime is down '' does not make your argument valid or anyone else 's less so . 
  the fact of the matter is , `` refugees '' commit a disproportionate amount of crime in comparison to native germans , so overall crime statistics hold no weight in any argument in that regard . 
  tell me again about the great police work after new years eve and how many of the victims from that night found at least some justice with their perpetrators sitting in jail right now . 
  good thing you 'd rather see the lives of germans at stake though , because of those poor , poor moroccans and algerians fleeing from war . 
  because people working their ass off 50-60 hours a week to get food on the table and buy some nice things for themselves and their kids makes for a `` high '' standard of living on paper , but does n't change the suckiness of their government .
