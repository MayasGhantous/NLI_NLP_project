  we tend to call the germans [ piefkes ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/piefke ) and the italians [ katzelmacher ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/katzelmacher ) . 
  he also turned austria into a police state , but i ca n't dispute the resulting stability . 
  one could argue that the sch\u00fctzen are a minority , but there has always been broad support for separatists . 
  the svp , a party which always pushed for more autonomy and ultimatively for the return to austria , holds the post of the minister president of southern tyrole since ww2 . 
  they fought back for some time , but then they realised that terrorism gets you nowhere . 
  since then they furthered their goals only by political means . 
  so you would n't be angry if finland got annexed by sweden or russia ? 
  s\u00fcdtirol never chose to became part of italy , as you can read in the article . 
  according to [ wot ] ( http://www.mywot.com/en/scorecard/theecoexperts.co.uk?utm_source=addon&amp;utm_content=contextmenu ) , this site is promoted through spam and is also actively spamming . 
  source ? 
  ok , it seems you are n't aware of the situation in austria . 
  for the last weeks , our central refugee processing station ( `` erstaufnahmestelle '' ) in traiskirchen had to take care of more than double of its capacity . 
  people had to sleep in garages , janitors closets , even outside . 
  the government had to build tent cities cause the austrian states did n't find enough places for the refugees to stay . 
  each of the austrian muncipality has to provide accommodation & care for an amount of refugees mounting up to at least 1,5 % of its population . 
  as you can see , austria was already doing its share . 
  that was the situation before germany closed the borders . 
  you have to explain this comment to me . 
  cause right now salzburg suddenly has to accommodiate several thousands refugees more than expected without time to prepare . 
  and what is austria supposed to do with the refugees that are n't allowed to enter germany once the border controls are up and running ? 
  wtf :  de maiziere : vorgehen `` auch aus sicherheitsgr\u00fcnden ''  deutschland sei nicht f\u00fcr gro\u00dfteil der fl\u00fcchtlinge zust\u00e4ndig de maziere says germany is n't responsible for the lion 's share of the refugees . 
  that 's an excellent reason to dump them on austria . 
  you are wrong . 
  in burgenland , the sp\u00d6 formed a coalition with the fp\u00d6 , in styria the \u00d6vp formed a coalition with the sp\u00d6 . 
  the question is : who protects the austrian minority in germany ? 
  bayern should be treated like s\u00fcdtirol !, 
  [ relevant satw-comic ] ( http://satwcomic.com/how-to-keep-friends ), 
  that 's not true . 
  [ this swedish general ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lennart_torstensson ) even managed to gain control over one end of a danube bridge near vienna . 
  on his way he destroyed [ castles ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgruine_staatz ) and also laid waste to markets in lower austria . 
  so are you critcizing austria for letting too few or too much refugees pass ? 
  [ at least de maziere said 3.200 refugees per day are too much ] ( http://wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/nachrichten/newsletter/4931203/fluchtlinge-deutschland-droht-osterreich-mit-konsequenzen - ) . 
  what is germanys proposal to solve this mess ( other than rolling the problem of to austria ) ? 
  hi , i respect your judgement , but i think , that this opinion is as much about the question how europe should deal with terrorist attacks as , for example , [ this opionion piece ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t5eq9/the_paris_attacks_prove_charlie_hebdos_critics/ ) . 
  especially now that various governments are using the events to push for more surveillance . 
   i am ... not david cameron . 
  proof ? 
  the germans stole the melody of the old austrian anthem . 
  huh ? 
  at least in austria it 's no secret that nearly everyone threatens to use the veto if certain conditions are n't met . 
  [ for example , this caricature was published in an austrian newspaper yesterday . 
  ] ( http://images02.kurier.at/46-52396183.jpg/940x540nocrop2/1.376.616 ), 
  this is incorrect . 
  our cancellor said he wo n't accept the budget if austria loses its rebate on the brit rebate and the budget for rural developements is heavily cut . 
  this blog suggests that we would veto if one of these two conditions is n't met . 
  it seems to me you really want to reinforce stereotypes . 
  why else would you insult a stranger on the internet ? 
  would you care to elaborate ? 
  in which context am i german ? 
  because this is the flag of austria , the country i live in . 
  america , on the other hand is still a continent ( two , actually ) . 
  so op basically asked why we hate two continents . 
  why should i hate the cubans ? 
  they are just poor bastards which are heavily sanctionized by the us . 
  or are you from brazil ? 
  mexico ? 
  you might want to be a bit more specific . 
   how many people were surveyed , and where did they survey ? 
  they described the method on page 2 : http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/11/17/survey-methods-20/, 
  wow , portugal seems to have greedy mobile phone provider . 
  i pay 14 $ / month f\u00fcr 1.000 minutes , 1.000 sms and 1 gb of data and the costs for my smart phone are already included . 
  i must correct you . 
  we austrians ( and i guess also bavarians ) use the high german standard only when dealing with people who does n't understand our dialect . 
  `` high german '' derived from german dialects in the center of germany . 
  its use as the official german language slowly began after luther used it in his bible . 
  yes . 
  then we could finally become one country again , after friedrich i barbarossa tore bavaria and austria apart . 
  you are n't the first to propose this . 
  the german industrialist hans-olaf henkel introduced the idea , and it never really leaves the discussions in the german-speaking countries . 
  you can read up on in in the [ german wikipedia article ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nord-euro_und_s%c3%bcd-euro ) , if you do n't mind using google translate . 
  the main argument against the splitting are - ) the debt would n't just disappear - ) a northern euro would have a much higher value than the recent euro , therefore hurting exports - ) the transition would cost 250 to 340 billion euros in germany alone . 
  - ) it could split the european union in the long run . 
  you used google translate , right ? 
  when i visited the austrian parliament , i asked the security officer if i should submit my pocket knife - he said i can keep it . 
  i also had a rucksack with me which was n't searched . 
  / r/ridf has just 6 subscribers at the moment , while / r/europe has more than 16.000 , so i do n't think this is a big issue . 
  more important , i like reddit because it stimulates freedom of speech and the exchange of ideas . 
  this also includes ideas that i do n't support . 
  if this guy has valid arguments , they will be discussed , otherwise they wo n't get enough support to stay on the frontpage . 
  you have n't understood the argument . 
  eurosceptics were claiming that countries outside the eu are faring better than countries inside the eu and used switzerland and norway as examples . 
  but norway has lots of oil , switzerland a banking industry which is used wordlwide for tax avoidance . 
  so the wealth of both countries sources from factors which have nothing to do with the lack of eu membership . 
  additionaly , both countries adopt eu regulations and contribute to the eu budget - so they kinda integrated into the eu without becoming actual members and therefore have nearly no influence on eu-legislation . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm not arguing that it would be favorable for them to join the eu . 
  i just want to point out that these two countries are rich enough to do whatever they want without getting into economic troubles . 
  iceland , on the other hand would be an interesting case study . 
  i thought you guys got rid of the mercantilistic mindset ? 
  switzerland avoided 2 world wars and built up a banking industry where the banking secrecy allows pretty everyone worldwide ( who is rich enough ) to hide his money . 
  thereby they benefit from tax avoidance in other countries . 
  we are mainly going there for the dentists and the eye laser surgeries . 
  the price difference is quite enormous . 
  i think that 's okay as long as they state that they are financed by the european commission . 
  i guess you also trust bbc to a certain extend while you know that it 's financed by the british government . 
  also , in these cases one knows the agenda of the investors . 
  i never informed myself on the motives of the owners of the telegraph , spiegel or el pais and i guess neither have you . 
  but we read them anyway , because we are able to make up our own mind , hopefully based on multiple sources . 
  i have n't thought of abolishing representative democracy , but of the possibility to enforce laws by direct democracy ( similar to the swiss model , maybe with more protection for minorities ) . 
  direct democracy, 
  i never said that i 'm in favour of the tax , i just stated that the ftt could replace or lower taxes that are even worse for the gdp .
