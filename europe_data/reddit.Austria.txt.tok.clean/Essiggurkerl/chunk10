  talking about `` human races '' is just a nonsensical concept - where do you draw the line ? 
  autochton austrians could look like a stereotypical `` irish '' - red hair , blue eyes , does n't tan but burns in the sun or like stereotypical south-italians ( dark hair , brown eyes , tan nicely when catching a bit of light ) . 
  are those different races for you ? 
  probably not . 
  but a typical sizilian does n't look significantly different from a maltese , some marroccans or egyptians . 
  not a good start for a new race-box - so , is it the next country border ? 
  sudan , or maybe only south sudan ? 
  i bet these countries also have a variety of differently `` shaded '' people . 
  now let 's go east : i ca n't differenciate a west-russian from the other europeans ( if he does n't sport a stereotypical haircut ) , however further east you go in russia , the more the looks will change towards `` asian '' - where in this country is now the border between `` caucasian '' and `` asian '' humans ? 
  google-imagesarch `` famous azerbaijans '' - literally caucasians - and you will find people that you might categorize `` european '' , `` middle-eastern '' and `` indian '' . 
  i really do n't get how you can seperate people into neat race-boxes , all i see is a contunuum of gradually changing `` typical '' looks . 
  vienna checking in . 
  i know definitely more mixed - `` race '' couples than non-european same-ethnicity couples . 
  probability is just in favour of that . 
  in order to have same-nonaustrian-ethnicity couples you either already have your spouce before moving to austria , or decide to specifically date within your religion/ethnicity ( or let your parents set you up with someone from the `` old country '' ) . 
  there does n't appear to be specific anti-iter `` racial '' relationship stigma like i have heared exists in the us . 
  though bringing somebody home with a different ethnicity will definitly be a nouvelty for a lot of . 
  i 'd suspect xenophopia is more of a thing - so for your `` xenophobic uncle '' it would be a relieve to learn that you do n't date a ` strange immigrant with a questionable cultural background ' , but just a differend-pigmented austrian .

  i hear you . 
  i hate it when those after-ski bars dissaminate their `` music '' all day long to unsuspecting skiers . 
  as for the music choice : it 's probably to boost alcohol sales because people can only tolarate that `` music '' while being shitfaced . 
  a walk along vienna donakanal is a good way to see contemprary graffity - because spaying is legal here , people can take the time to make something nice . 
  collections are posted here : https://www.meinbezirk.at/themen/donaukanal+graffiti.html, 
  perception is probably different , because while weak in actual power , the federal states are big on rhetorics : like national politicians like blaming anything bad on `` brussels '' , `` vienna '' will be made responsible for anything negativ by the `` local lords '' , ignoring that national politicians come from all over the country , not just evil moustage-twisting city folk . 
  the garbage that is sold as `` folk music '' [ nsfw ] ( https://youtu.be/bylr0ymwh8y ), 
  if i can expand on that : etiquette in coffee houses : a coffee always comes with a glass of water - if not , you know you are not in a proper coffee house . 
  stay as long as you wish , nobody will rush you here . 
  write a novel , plan a revolution or browse the newspapers provided here in these awesome newspaper holders . 
  because the waiter wo n't bother you for hours you after you have placed your first order , you have to give them a signs if you want to order something else or want the bill . 
  you do n't need to pay for the whole table at once - just tell the waiter what you had and they will calculate your personal bill for you . 
  hand them the money with a tip of up to 10 % . 
  precisely : they tell you the sum you owe , and in case you do n't have the amount you want to pay ( including the tip ) on you , you hand them a bill and while stating how much you want them to keep .

  what is `` survive '' for you ? 
  tourist-survival ( order food , ask for the way , great people ... ) absolutly . 
  residence-survival ( understand a rent contract , administrative formalities , find work ... ) no, 
  apart from some already mentioned : beyondpod for podcasts qando wien for pubic transport, 
  reading from the thread you linked to :  the flowers and the ** bridesmaids dresses ** at the very least usually match . 
  i think here is the important difference : we do n't have bridesmaids , so we do n't have to communicate a colour scheme to guests before the wedding . 
  for the people doing the decorating however , deciding on a colour scheme , so that table decorations , flowers etc. 
  match is n't an unusual thing . 
  but that 's not just true for a wedding , but also balls or anything that 's not a childs birstday party . 
  i personaly know an austrian guy who changed from playing american foodball to rugby `` because it is less brutal '' - that 's when i learend there is at least one team doing that sport in austria . 
  i have never heared it mentioned in any sport reporting or activity anybody else does personally . 
  so no , not popular at all nor do i see any signs of that changing . 
  goodbye lenin to blame for the first ? 
  naschmarkt is n't that different to other markets , but very overpriced . 
  same for the saturday morning fleemarket in that area . 
  android smartphones some prefer the high end devices , some the bargains . 
  samsung galaxy s2 and its followers were the most sold devices . 
  - recently different brands since the accu problems . 
  i only consciously met former portugese immigrants/guest workers while on holiday in portugal : it was always a nice surprice meeting someone who speaks german to you , their explenation always was that they had worked in germany or austria . 
  i do n't know any portugese immigrants in austria - so either the numbers are quite low , or they `` fail '' to get any negativ attention . 
  probably both ? 
  let 's top that : k\u00e4sleberk\u00e4s, 
  i enjoy tea later in the evening , but do n't feel it fits well to food . 
  ( herb teas that is , i do n't like the taste of those tea trees , whether fermented or not ) . 
  our great tap water is the thing i am most looking forward to whenever coming home from a journey . 
  i wanted to suggest [ die gute k\u00fcche ] ( https://www.amazon.de/die-gute-k%c3%bcche-%c3%b6sterreichische-standardkochbuch/dp/3701503109/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1488155339&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=die+gute+k%c3%bcche ) - also by plachutta , but probably a more traditional verson . 
  on a bike i would n't wait , because there is likely a sensor that does n't detect me and would never turn green . 
  [ pallas athene guards our parliament ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/austria_parlament_athena_bw.jpg ) - though the statue is not a replica of a particlular ancient greek statue afaik, 
  no , never heard of that,

  i 'd change ours to anything less boring - double speed would be a first step . 
  internet : need to restart my router every few weeks - if that does n't count than about 2 years ago phone : ca n't remember, 
  the wine quater , a part of the state of lower austria - now slowlly picking up with bike tourists, 
  technically true , but nowadays everybody calls @ `` et '' , even when wikipadia calls it [ `` at-zeichen '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/at-zeichen ) - i guess for that reason & is called `` und '' more and more, 
  not a question of country , but of village/town/city size - my grandma 's `` one-horse-village '' has no tagging whatsoever , bigger cities do . 
  a ( vw - ) bus that seats 8-9 ppl - but not driving around downtown , but taking the shortest way to the motorway to get some place else . 
  for tv and radio news most trusted and i 'd say objectively best quality is our national broadcaster orf . 
  with newspapers the answer will be different depending on your political leaning - we have quality newspapers with slight leanings in both directions , unfortunately the most read newspaper is a dreadful tabloid . 
  usa - sometimes also `` amerika '' but that is very confusing because that word is used for both the continent and one country on it . 
  there is no standard bairisch , no univied orthgraphy or grammar you could turn into an official language . 
  would be easier to name the non-foreign movies . 
  if broadcasted on tv they will be dubbed however - or come from germany anyways . 
  why bavarian ? 
  that 's simmilar to the dialect of salzburg , but not to every austrian dialect . 
  we do have standardised austrian german as our national language , as you can find it in the \u00d6sterreichischem w\u00f6rterbuch op linked to - do n't mix up austrian standard german with dialects . 
  well , it 's enforced only for exams at school and employees in the public sector - everybody else is free to spell however they want . 
  - they just look increasingly stupid for not going with the time . 
  there was a transition period for years where both forms were correct even in exams , so the switch was n't hard on people . 
  in fact a few publishers were against the spelling reform and pledged to not switch to the new spelling with their books and newspapers - you can read up on the reform at [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_orthography_reform_of_1996 ) though the german version is much more detailed, 
  me too, 
  miles are only used in fairy tales here - so it is a huge distance when you are in an imaginay world where everybody walks or rides a horse . 
  most closely bvt i 'd guess ( bundesamt f\u00fcr verfassungsschutz und terrorismusbek\u00e4mpfung ) but calling them a spy agency is an overstatement . 
  could n't find that model either . 
  the cheapest hp 15-ay - ( some other number ) starts at 480 $ http://geizhals.at/?fs=hp+notebook+-+15-ay182no&amp;in=, 
  thanks for clearing that up - false friend alarm, 
   does n't `` pronto '' mean `` hurry up '' wanted to ask the same thing - we have even imported the word with that ( wrong ) meaning : adding `` aber pronto '' after your demand expresses great impatience . 
   does n't warrant you stares i think it 's mostly the cultural difference : what some non-germans experience as `` stares '' is just `` looking-at-people '' for old middle-european folks . 
   the ones who take the frankfurt - paris train well , germans on holiday is a different story, 
  well , to cook rice i grab a cup - size according to my hunger/the number of eaters - and than add 2 cups of water . 
  does that count ? 
  only through these questions on reddit i realized that for some people `` cup '' does n't mean `` grab any cup you want '' but refers to a defined volumn . 
  now that one english-language recipe makes some sense i saw once where a number of things were given in `` cups '' but than other were not . 
  we have a simple cake called [ becherkuchen ] ( https://www.gutekueche.at/schoko-becherkuchen-rezept-23679 ) = beaker cake where you measure everything in whatever size of cup you want . 
  non really in newspapers or tv channels afaik , but on facebook - the fp\u00d6 posting some made up or hugely over exaggerated shit and likeminded people repost it - those in that filter bubble have a very skewed worldview . 
  depends on how you define `` antiamericanism '' : `` real animosity '' against the us - or us citizens is something that only exists among some very far right or very far left folks .
