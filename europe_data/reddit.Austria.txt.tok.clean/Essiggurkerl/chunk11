  what is seen very critical here is the `` rah-rah-patriotism '' that is displayed by a lot of americans . 
  blindly repeating empty propaganda lines like `` being the only free country , the only developed nation , the one country which gives oportunities to it 's peoples '' while at the same time the disparity between rich and poor is huge in the us and ever growing , whilstle blowers are treated like war criminals and non-us-victims of `` peace keeping ( or oil-freeing ) missions '' are not even reported in their national media . 
  we have learend to be predominatly critical of our nation and our politicians so this jingoism from people who would have all the oportunities to find out the truth about their nation does n't sit well with us . 
  if you call this critical distance anti-americanism , than you will find a lot . 
  it 's those slight cultural differences you need to look out for to `` instantly tell where a person is from by looking at them '', 
  agreed - with the exception of questions that are probably interesting for other european readers - i 'd encourage `` how is fasching/fasnacht celebrated in germany compared to carneval in other countries '' ; i 'd discourage `` i 'd like to travel from m\u00fcnchen to berlin - is autobahn connection a or b better ? '', 
  well no , they choose to wear [ larger cloth ] ( https://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/docs/2014/04/0517-maffly-kipp_mormon-missionaries-550x358.jpg ) ( or borrow them from their dad ? ), 
  even when they could fit in [ smaller ] ( https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/htb1kmfylxxxxxcfxxxxq6xxfxxxr/2016-spring-black-white-light-blue-wine-font-b-red-b-font-font-b-dress-b.jpg ) ones, 
  there 's also fm4 reality check that is mostly in english - but as it is geared towards english-speaking imigrants originally , it is somewhat more in the anglosphere than really a 100 % the topics most important to austians : http://static.orf.at/podcast/fm4/fm4_reality_check_podcast.xml, 
  there are slight differences - american guys tend to dress in shirts that are much too big for them . 
  i disagree our police is trained for years , not just weeks like in most places in the us . 
  they learn how to deescalate a situation , and if they must use force they try everything to not imideatly kill their oponent . 
  warning shots are obligatory . 
  to make even the most trigger happy idiots among our police think twice before they use their gun out of lazyness , there is some burocratic files you need to fill out every time you even touch your gun while on the job . 
   people from other parts of bavaria and austria migrate to munich to celebrate no , we are happy to leave that to tourists from further away - basically every village has their own folk festival , so of you want to experience bad folks music and drunk people there is no need to drive all the way tu munich , knock-offs that are also called `` oktoberfest '' is a very recent developement . 
  munich is a lovely city , but i prefer to visit it any time other then oktoberfest , and enjoy a good beer in the englische garten or viktualienmarkt . 
  imho oktoberfest has developed in a massivlely overpriced mass event . 
  well , i could google that for you , but the question was about the opinion of a.n. 
  - and my answer should depict , that most austrians probably have heared of that name , but do n't know much else about him and therefore have no positiv or negateiv opinion . 
  op probably thinks every zeltfest is an `` oktoberfest '', 
  admiral nelson has a statue on trafalgar square - i remember that from english class . 
  what he has the statue for was n't covered in the london sightseeing chapter of the textbook, 
  which country ? 
  interesting that wikipedia only has definitions for specifically english and german - i had assumed a simmilar word existed in the other european languages , but maybe not . 
  so to a polish person , `` oriental '' is both the german + english group of countires, 
  with `` oriental '' do you mean asia minor , or east asia ? 
  our associacion with `` orientalisch '' is asia minor , levant ( 100 and 1 night , if you want to think very stereotypically ) but i have noticed that native english speakers mean far east like china when they say `` oriental '' - it would be an interesting question how the other european countries understand this expression . 
  i have such a sticker and it works like a charm - i also put self-made `` bitte keine werbung '' notes on other peoples post boxes while looking after their plants and post box and even those worked fine . 
  so technically hitler is german also ? 
  no , but notifications brought me back never heard `` stammreihe '' but as we have compound nouns in german , it is an allowed combination - probably meaning something similar like stammbaum = family tree . 
  stamm itself means trunk or tribe . 
  the page you linked to says it is a adelsdatenbank = nobility data base - if you are not nobility , probably not that usefull to you . 
  where was he from ? 
  simply guessing he might be a farmers boy ( because many were in that time ) : different regions had different hereditary laws - in some regions the oldest son would inherit the whole farm while the younger ones needed to find work as a farmhand somewhere else . 
  other regions devided the land among their children . 
  maybe the promise to get land of his own in the new world would be the motivation to emigrate ? 
  i recenly saw a documentary about tyrolians in brazil - they formed entire villages in the rain forest - got huge land areas for very cheap , but had turn jungle into farmland with no infrastructure around . 
  some kept their traditions and even speak a fossile tyrolan today . 
  here in the east skoda is very common - maybe there is a gradient towards the czech border ? 
  do n't you ? 
   are they really as infamous as they are portrayed to be ? 
  no idea unless you point out how they are porteyed in your country/the media you consume/your filter bubble / ... 
  without you even naming your home country so that we can have some guess what you are refering too there is really no way to give a sensible answer . 
   just the most glorious or martyr parts . 
  that 's really worrysome imo - paving the way for some populist nuts to tap into feelings of gradeur or seeking revenge for past infringements . 
  well , you could vote `` white '' = do n't mark anything on the sheet as to express `` i care enough about politics that i came here , but there is nobody i can vote for '' , could n't you ? 
  i think only in the uk there is this notion of the uk not being `` europe . '', 
  i was very confused when i heared english people or media talk about `` europe '' as if they were not a part of it , until i realized that they appear to use the word `` europe '' and `` continental europe '' interchangeably . 
  [ fair enough ] ( https://youtu.be/ej03hldbpdc?t=2m31s ), 
  well , even after 4 years of learning french , i 'd say \u00e9 and \u00e8 still sound like a `` variety of e '' while the umlaute are totally different vowel sounds - \u00e4 can be described as an e sound , \u00f6 and \u00fc are something new . 
  if i remember correctly , they were refering to the crime rate . 
  those are not diacritics , but [ umlaute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/umlaut_ ( linguistics ) - the sound changes significantly . 
  not typing the dots/adding the e will sound as wrong , as if you had written any other wrong vowel instead . 
  [ `` wien must not become chicago '' ] ( http://www.raketa.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/c162ab89a803c062a93f6e86096b13da.jpg ) comes to mind, 
  sz is oldfahioned - i had already typed  \u00df -  ss or ( oldfashioned ) sz but then deleted the '' ( oldfashioned ) '' because it looked confusing . 
  i quite liked krakau - would you call that a shithole ? 
  please , his name is schr\u00f6dinger - do n't copy american mispronunciation back into writing . 
  no problem , write oe instead , same with \u00e4 -  ae , \u00fc -  ue , \u00df -  ss or sz, 
  i know it as `` eintropf-suppe '' ( drop-in-soup ) - you can use left over flour and egg from making schnitzel, 
  no - people would probalby assume the hairdresser was changed into a governental building and pass right by it . 
  we do n't do flags - had our fair share of flags everywhere from 1938 - 1945 . 
  depends on which metric you are looking at . 
  renuable energy ( mostly water ) is huge , wind energy growing , solar power lags a bit behind germany . 
  thermal rehabilitation and renuable heating sources is subsidized , low energy houses and passiv houses are quite popular for new buildings . 
  electric cars are n't growing as fast as in the leading european countries , hybrid cars are more popular . 
  and because our taxes on fuel are a bit lower then in neighbour countries , we have a huge `` fuel tourism '' comming in , which makes it look like we do n't save on co2 at all . 
  nice username , 
  i guess you are trolling, 
  and that 's due to our constitution ( = verfassung ) ? 
  i think you misinterpreted the question . 
  catholic , that 's why i am surprised, 
  reading about it made me realize that we have no special food for three-kings-day at all , which is strange since usually have traditional food for everything - like [ allerheiligenstriezel ] ( http://www.baeckerei-buchegger.at/uploads/pics/striezel_kopie.jpg ) for all-saints-day , [ osterpinzen ] ( http://images.wogibtswas.at/data/image/500x705/499/oelz-mini-osterpinzen-2493669.jpg ) ( easter ) and of course the [ faschingskrapfen ] ( http://images.ichkoche.at/data/image/variations/496x384/1/sacher-faschingskrapfen-carnival-doughnuts-img-2289.jpg ) for carneval . 
  rather it 's the feast day of packaged sweets : kids dressed up as the 3 kings go from house to house collecting money for a charity - and some people also give out some sweets for the kids to keep . 
  true . 
  when thinking about france + military our first association is them as invadors/occupying force during the napoleonic wars . 
  there might be some `` international law '' master program that is indeed taught in english on some austrian universities - but your master should be very close to your bacherlor degree , or you will have to catch up on a lot of material - and even do a lot of tests - that were in the bachelor program . 
  even in germany you have different names in different regions , afaik , but here the only correct name is krapfen . 
  i looked that up some time ago : tsom is a hollywood remake of an austrian movie that was very popular back then . 
  when tsom hit the cinemas , the sequel to the original movie had just run , so nobody was interested in the `` disneyfied '' version of the same story again . 
  if you are interested in a kitschy old movie that is somewhat popular in austria watch the sissy-movies with romy schneider . 
  i 've seen those youtube videos claiming the only true way to peel a banana is doing it bottom up , but peeling them using the stem as a lever ( how is common here ) works better for me . 
  yes , winter tires are obligatory during winter conditions from november to april . 
  trucks need to carry snow chains . 
  thanks now i 'm wondering how a christmas tradition has shifted to a carneval tradition in your area - cultural exchange , always interesting . 
  i am not talking about any local languages , but the national language . 
  you need to know that in order to follow your courses . 
  there are a few master programs which are taught in english , but since you did n't specify having any bachelor degrees , i assumed you are talking about starting . 
  i googled it for you : http://studentpoint.univie.ac.at/en/application/voraussetzungen/knowledge-of-german/, 
  how good is your german ? 
  afaik there is not much of a barrier for people with eu passports in austria , but you have to proove you speak german very well .

  what does a king cake look like ? 
  hm , in austria the austrian roma + sinti are mostly well integrated . 
  - awareness about them rose in the majority society after a pipe bomb attack on a roma settlement . 
  calling them `` zigeuner '' ( probably equivalent to gypsy ) is politically incorrect . 
  [ little documentary in german ] ( https://youtu.be/7dmbugheet4 ) what is a problem is that since schengen was extended , there is an organized begging tourism from eastern european countries and house burglary gangs that often `` employ '' roma . 
  well , when we went there we learned `` and btw , the old winnetou movies were filmed there '' but it was n't the reason to go there , but because it it a beautiful national park , the water makes it cool there even on a hot summer day . 
  a good daytrip for a mostly beach holiday . 
  yes , the cows blocking the road definitly should be sheep , how dare they !!, 
  i like the simplicity of our flag , also it 's the oldest in the world ( if you count in and exclude the fitting factors ) and has a `` funny '' origin story .
