  or was the question about the eu flag ? 
  while i think having a number of things on the flag that could be misinterpreted with the number of members is n't ideal , i like that is is quite different to the mostly tricolor country flags . 
  no , i would n't want to change it . 
  interesting optical illusion when you compare the percieved size of the star circle on the austrian and latvian flag . 
  maybe not so much in the cities , but in villages traditional architecture varies a lot already in the form of the village - just talking about 2 of our 9 federal states , lower - and upper austria : in the east we have [ ribbon-built villages ] ( http://www.pleamle-magazin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/strassendorf.jpg ) where the dwelling house was in the front , than stables along one side and the big door to the back alley . 
  in the west we have scattered villages , single farms standing on their own , most typical the [ `` for-corner-farm '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/vierkanthof ) googling for pictures i came across [ this ] ( http://www.pleamle-magazin.com/2010/09/dorf-und-hof/ ) which shows even more village forms/farm house forms in different regions of austria . 
  the question was not about the number of foreign languages but of `` languages '' - so , counting german in . 
  i do n't think something between 2-3 is too high , even with lot 's of old people , who have no or very basic english - after all , most people < 40 have learned at least 2 foreingn language at school . 
  also : lots of activism take a look into the history of the womans movement or the lgbt movement for example : men did n't suddenly give woman the right to vote - or own stuff because they agreed that `` all man are born equal '' should mean `` all humans are born equal '' : generations of women fought for this - in the streets , in their homes and families , and wherever else possible . 
  change never happened magically `` becaue suddenly the people in power agreed that them having all the power was unfair '' but because the oppressed organized - and together with allies of the privileged grous - made a lot of fuzz for a lot long time in order to gain some progress . 
  left handed peoples better hand is the left , their worse hand is the right one . 
  different-handedness is the whole reason i formulated it that way . 
  i do n't understand what you mean here . 
  we do n't have the fork in the worse hand to make life more difficult , but because we already have the knive in the good hand . 
   how is only using one hand to eat child-like ? 
  because here only kids who are too young to use a knive - and handle two tools at once - would just have the fork in their good hands when eating food that needs cutting like meat . 
  if you are eating something that does n't need cutting - let 's say a some hotpot - then , in a casual setting , it would be ok to just yead the fork in your good hand , and nothing in the other . 
  but in any more formal setting , you still hold knive + fork in order to load your fork more easily . 
   some people see putting your hand on the table just as rude as elbows on the table . 
  while our table rules agree with `` no elbows on the table '' , not having your hands on the table during a meal is a bigger offence i 'd say . 
   we dont cut all of the meat at the same time . 
  we cut , set knife down , switch hands , eat , switch hands again , pick up knife , cut food , repeat . 
  that 's a bit better but still would look as if you are too clumsy to find into your mouth with your worse hand . 
  so , you revert to this child-like eating style in order to look extra fancy ? 
  wow , til putting your hand into your lap while eating would be a big no-no , especially if you want to impress - everybody would ask themselves what you are doing down there . 
  who has ever seen anybody balancing food on the back of their fork , like the video claims to be the `` european way '' ? 
  we do the same in austria . 
  yes , but it 's a question of age : people below 40 are much more likly to greet friends that way than older folks . 
  i encountered people like that in paris , hanging around the most touristy spots like in front of notre dame , trying to make people sign a sheet with their contact details , and simultainsously bagging for money . 
  agreed, 
  not from a travellers perspective : it is most important to know that i can use the same curency i used in italy when entering san marino . 
  not having heared much about microstates in the real of politics is n't surprising . 
  i see it as an outdated term from the cold war - nato countries were `` the west '' , warsaw pact coutries were `` the east '' . 
  as the cold war is over , and warsaw pakt does n't exist any more , also this old expression of `` the west '' - which is soaked with moral supriority - should no longer be used . 
  believe me , lots of people have a credit card - for the few payments that are not possible with debit card ( like booking some flights , or trains in the uk over the internet . ), 
  but unless i am abroad , i never have the credit card on me . 
  since nfc i prefer using debit cards in grocery stores also - even faster than cash now .

  a good example for the spelling nightmare ( or nigthmeir/nightmeere/nightmair - you ca n't tell from listening ) : how can the vowels `` oo , u , e , ue '' rhyme , and there is a different set of `` oo , ou '' . 
  in german , we use more then just 5 letters to describe vowel sounds - umlaute ( \u00e4 , \u00f6 \u00fc ) and zwielaute ( au , eu ei , \u00e4u ) but their pronunciation is very consistent . 
  to me this is the worst kind of `` christians '' at least how this word is used here : people who want to keep the baggage that `` religion '' has soaked up over the centuries ( conservativism , homophobia , xenophobia , ... ) but want nothing to do with christian values ( helping the poor , loving their `` neighbour = foreigner '' , trying to be a better person yourselve before critizising anybody else ) claim to be a `` cultural christian '' . 
  strache , our fp\u00d6 demagogue [ waving around a cross as if foreigners were vampires ] ( http://diepresse.com/home/politik/eu/481151/kardinal-schoenborn-liest-strache-die-leviten ) comes to mind .

  edit : ( ) for better readability, 
  yes they are - they are so common , that we hardy think of them as `` actually deriving from 2 words '' . 
  using the non - contracted original words looks/sounds odd and would only be done when communicating with a beginner-level learner of german i assume op thought of the contractions of verb + personal pronoun that only exist in spoken language like `` gemma = gehen wir '' `` werma = werden wir '' `` samma = sind wir '' `` hamma = haben wir '' etc. 
  - those vary a bit from region to region . 
  what do you mean with `` traditionally christian but without believing in a god '' ? 
  some babaric regions , like for example the federal state of upper austria do n't know about `` dreiviertel '' , but use `` viertel vor = quater to '' . 
  but i ca n't speak about `` all german '' , there are a lot of regional differences in germany and switzerland too . 
  nearly the same , but we do n't say `` two carters '' , but `` half : 9:15 viertel zehn 9:30 halb zehn 9:45 dreiviertel zehn 10:00 zehn,

   here in europe , or at as far as i 've seen , being patriotic is considered to be completely natural - as in , pretty much everyone is attached more to their country than any other identity . 
  well , speak for yourself - most people i know definitly identify more with other things than their nation - be it the region they grew up in , their football club , europe , political identity , sexual identity , ... and on our national day , hardly anybody than state/city owned buildings raises a flag - and nobody is obliged to or finds that odd .

  so , calling them national socialistic would be more accurate ? 
  sounds like fp\u00d6 in a nutshell - only that the fp\u00d6 just claims to be `` for the little people ( workers , small income ) '' - when you look what they acually voted for whenever they have some political party , they are a more-money-to-the-rich party . 
  in german , the correct term is tschechien . 
  then there is an oldfashioned term `` tschechei '' - it a shorthand for tschechoslovakei , so it is definitly not correct today , also it might carry negative connotations . 
  because czechia looks somewhat simmilar to tschechei , i 'd guess german-speakers will be somewhat reluctant in adapting to that new term , and will only start using it once czech people assure us that that 's what they want to be called in english . 
  with freedom of movement - do you mean schengen area , or visa-free travel , or the guaranteed right to live and work in those countries ? 
   how much they bring in from tourism are there any numbers supporting the idea that todays royals are bringing in a significant number of tourists ? 
  i like to visit nice castles etc - so the inequality in past centuries does something for todays tourism , but i doubt that the existance of living royals makes it any more likely for a significant number of tourists to visit that country and not the republic next to it . 
  samsung used to be the most popular , huawei is gaining some reach atm , some poor bastards are still stuck with iphones . 
  i must say , i am worming up to their concept of `` cultural appropriation '' - critique, 
  also we have a system simmilar to what is already descriped here for denmark and the netherlands . 
  german \u2260 germanic, 
  the cluster is the prove - every name for itself can/should be considered totally innocent - maybe the parents liked the sound of it / a relative with said name / the story that character stars in ... - but only using germanic names for your mutterkreuz-worthy amount of children you have shows your political leanings . 
  no , those are just oldfashioned german names , not considered to be `` nazi parants choice '' . 
  to give an example of the kids of said polititian : wolf , horst , volker , mechthild , hedda , alwine , adne , sonnhilde , hildrun .

  agreed , however wenn talking about the people , saying `` die briten '' is more common than `` die engl\u00e4nder '' - probably because it is shorter . 
  also , `` gro\u00dfbritannien '' is assumed to be the correct term - the vast majority of people will be surprised learning that technically it refers to the island without northern ireland , and something like `` vereinigtes k\u00f6nigreich '' should be the correct term . 
  btw . 
  is `` british '' also refering to uk-citizens living in northern ireland , or is there a different , correcter term in english, 
  how do you measure ? 
  * with our fresh green president we would be `` the most left that is n't communist '' ever * our government is a coalition of socialist and conservative party ( sp\u00d6 + \u00d6vp ) - so it would be very centrist * the right populists ( fp\u00d6 ) have some good poll ratings which is the deciding factor ? 
  well , my military stategic knowledge largly stems from the civ games , so take it with a grain of salt , but i 'd say in real life , you only send an army if there is even the slightest chance that they can achieve their objective . 
  of course , nowadays it would be much nicer if we could point back to a heroic self-sacrificing defence war against the invading nazi army - but if you consider that even much bigger , ww1-winning nations though they did n't stand a chance and opten for a truce once ww2 had started it becomes clearer how the situation must have looked like back then . 
  i would have liked to see more civil disobedience - if everybody acted like [ franz j\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_j%c3%a4gerst%c3%a4tter ) , ww2 would have ended after one day - but unfortunatly not everybody is able to sacrifice their life for the greater good . 
  well , i think that is your hindsight knowledge talking . 
  what could a very small ( due to the wwi peace contract ) army have done against a much bigger country , who had rearmed for years ? 
  it would have been a blood bath . 
  only mexico had protested against the anschluss - verbally - nobody would have come to assist austria .
