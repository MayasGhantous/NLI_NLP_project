  sending you army to be slaughtered just to prove that you are objecting to something inevitable - who should have given that command ? 
  only looking back we know that those soldiers were likely sent to their death a few years later anyway . 
  but the `` defend your territory until the last soldier died '' - strategy was something specific to the third reich , and not part of the austrian military strategy in 1938 . 
  there are different things to visit in the hofburg . 
  i 'd say the treasury is worth a visit - the crowns with huge jewels , but also odd things like an unicorn horn ( which turned out to be a narwhale horn ) . 
  the national library has changing exibitions , visit that only if the exibition is interesting to you , the cafeteria of the library is always a good stop for lunch though ( entrence from burggarten ) . 
  the imperial rooms could be skiped if you also plan to visit sch\u00f6nbrunn . 
  the riding school training is something i 'd only recommend to horse enthusiats . 
  you might be able to hear the boy choir sing in the hofburg chapel on sunday . 
  the ethnological museum is still closed for renovation , i think . 
  that 's about all i can think of to see directly in the hofburg - you can also just walk through the courtyards . 
  just across the street is the kunsthistorisches museum ( art historic museum ) - i would n't miss that , and across the next street is the museumsquartier with museums of modern art , but also lots of smaller exhibition spaces . 
  pushing young adults into military service is n't the only problem i see . 
  all this  pledge of allegiance and sing the national anthem stuff makes it harder for kids in those programs to think critically about their country . 
  if you blindly believe that you are always the `` good guys '' it is easier for your politicians to get away with invasions of other countries to free the oil or whatever resources it will be in the future . 
  yes , we had that too for a few years - [ its really handy back up once you have used up all your regular aged soldiers and it 's easiest to teach patriotism and esprit de corps when they are young ] ( https://youtu.be/pfrz9wiyfvw ) . 
  taking the audioguide there made the visit much more interesting for me - the voice telling you what happened where , how the stadium was flooded to show the sea battles etc. 
  - you can imagine it much better then just seeing the ruins and reading text in a guide book . 
  learning a lot of new things about automatic cars today , thanks . 
  i guess i would be safe if a car rental only had automatics after all .

  does it taste like [ maggi ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/maggiw%c3%bcrze-neu.jpg/169px-maggiw%c3%bcrze-neu.jpg ) ? 
  that 's what we would typically have next to salt , pepper and tooth picks . 
   and you suddenly increase throttle the car shifts down , to be able to quickly deliver the higher power needed it really does ? 
  thats reassuring for overtaking manouvers . 
  but i guess the gearbox in general would wear out more quickly from all the unnecessary shifts, 
  thanks , never heared of that sauce, 
  so the car can guess that i want extra speedup and shifts down a gear , when the usual reaction to higher throttle would be to shift up a gear ? 
  hewlett packard ? 
  it 's the norm . 
  i would n't know how to take down a gear if i want to overtake someone in an automatic car , or trust the engine break if i ca n't choose the proper gear . 
  the only person i know who drives an automatic car is disabled . 
  ok , here is my peanutbutter story : when i was still a child , probably early teens , my mum bought it once - there were lots of references in us movies/tv shows that we wanted to give it a try once it became a regular thing in supermarkets . 
  so the family gathered around wihe pb-glas , each with a spoon to try it . 
  i expected it to be somewhat like nutella , just with peanuts instead of hazelnut - which is a bit odd , since we unsally consume peanuts salted , not sweet , but i was open to that new experience . 
  it tasted awwwfullll - not salty , not sweet , just a greezy nothingnes with a hint of rancidness . 
  nobody wanted to try a second spoon . 
  we were a very do n't - throw-away-food houshold , so that jar of peanutbutter was sitting on the kitchen counter for months until my mother was sure it must have gone bad by now and happily threw it away . 
  since peanut butter is still available in supermarkets , there must be people who buy that stuff , but it 's nobody i know . 
  interesting , we achieve that by dressing up and running around making some noise - there is a [ nice ] ( https://youtu.be/hdjfkyogy4a ) and an [ ugly ] ( https://youtu.be/p4oymokaz5m ) version, 
  where are you from ? 
  the same pattern is true for austrian media . 
  short anwer why : the eu usually does n't fight back - politicians use it as an easy scapegoat for every unpopular move that they often have voted for themselves . 
  hey , why is austria not on the list ? 
  i 'd like me some nice swiss banks and chocolates, 
  we have an annual protest song contest . 
  find the winners , top 10 and top 25 of all the years on the [ wikipedia article ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/protestsongcontest ) . 
  during the contest all the contestants songs are directly linked on the site , now you will have to find them on youtube/the web yourself . 
  the next protestsongcontest final will take place on feb 12th , will also be on the radio ( and a videostram available on the internet ) http://fm4.orf.at/stories/1774552/, 
  what tradition is that ? 
  does an airgun at an [ amusement park ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schie%c3%9fbude#/media/file:schiessbude3.jpg ) count ? 
  i agree . 
  i do n't mind having a common sink-area either ( like i also saw in st. petersburg ) . 
  however , historically here in austria we always had seperated toilets , and only in the last years the idea came up to drop that seperation in order to make the public-toilet experience more trans-friendly . 
  and since russian politics is n't usually a front runner for lgbt-friendliness i asked for an explanation for the prevalence of unisex pubic toilets . 
  really ? 
  on the contrary i think/hope van-der-bellens victory will be more decisive this time - hopefully brexit/trump has woken up voting-lazy people this time . 
  various forms of [ self-made cookies ] ( http://polpix.sueddeutsche.com/bild/1.1543321.1354795574/900x600/plaetzchen.jpg ) , gingerbread included . 
  there is also [ christstollen ] ( http://ais.kochbar.de/kbrezept/72897_740066/400x266/weihnachtsstollen-rezept.jpg ) - more of a breakfast food/snack imo , because it 's quite filling . 
  no , telemarketing thankfully is forbidden here . 
  opinion polls are plenty though . 
  the only way telemarketing is allowed is , if you took something like a trial subscription to a newspaper and agreed to it in the fine-print . 
  never in my life have i seen more unisex bathrooms in cafes and restaurants then in st. petersburg , russia . 
  maybe somebody from russia can explain why ? 
  are unisex toilets a `` tradition '' there ? 
  here in austria they are not very common . 
  you find them either in more `` alternative '' cafes and clubs . 
  or in older buildings , that did n't consider they would need bathrooms for both sexes - some natural science and tech uni buildings come to mind . 
  btw , the sauna area of our local spa , where clothing is forbidden still has sex-differentiated toilets , so those topics are n't linked . 
  and then there are [ 461 naturschutzgebiete ] ( http://www.umweltbundesamt.at/umweltsituation/naturschutz/sg/nsg/ ) which are administrated by the federal states , so are probably an equivalent to a `` state park '' googeling further showed other categories of protected areas , [ 27 % of the area of austria is protected in some way ] ( http://austria-forum.org/attach/wissenssammlungen/essays/%c3%96kologie/naturerhaltungsgebiete/naturschutzgebiete-karte.jpg ), 
  yes , we sometimes played with the well aswell , until we realized that 4 figures ca n't give a fair game and dropped it again . 
  i fainly remember that there was `` fire '' too , but do n't remember the rules of it - 5 would be a valid set , like ... lizard-spock proved . 
  summs up the austrian experience , apart from tipping - 5-10 % would be expected , if everything was ok . not leaving any is a form showing you were not satisfied . 
  interrupting people mid-sentence , bringing the bill before being asked to or taking away plates before everyone on the table has finished is rude behaviour , which might diminish the tip for sure . 
  we call it schere-stein-papier = scissors-stone-paper - or `` klick klak kluk '' but while shaking we always count ( 1-2-3 ), 
  life in europe is much safer - less crime , less gun accidents etc , so they are not risking anythink , in fact they are much safer than if they stayed in the us, 
  interesting , in german we have `` rom sehen und sterben '' ( = `` you see rome and then you can die '' ), 
  we tried that once in 1934 - [ would n't recommend ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_state_of_austria ), 
  most important question for any of those cases : is he good at football ? 
  thats a broad question and an long periode for architecture . 
  an interesting ensemble - because those are 2 buildings right oposit to each other , both built in the first decade of the 20th century : the former ministery of war , today ministery of life , - [ modern picture ] ( https://www.bmlfuw.gv.at/.imaging/mte/bmlfuw/contentimageinline/dam/bmlfuw/ministerium/geschichte-des-ministeriums/geschichte-des-ministeriums/lebensministerium-800-x-600/jcr:content/lebensministerium%20800%20x%20600.png.png ) / [ old postcard ] ( https://www.bmlfuw.gv.at/ministerium/geschichte-lm/100_jahre.html ) : in the style of historism , like a lot at the [ ringstra\u00dfe ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiener_ringstra%c3%9fe ) , for this building they went for neobaroque . 
  btw , with central heating , a central clock system and several paternoster elevators it was a very modern office building on the inside . 
  [ the wiener postsparkasse ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiener_postsparkasse ) - programatic building of art nuveou , called [ jugendstil ] ( https://www.wien.info/de/sightseeing/sehenswuerdigkeiten/jugendstil ) here . 
  built by [ otto wagner ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_wagner ) who had a significant impact on viennas architecture not just with houses but also public transportation like the city train , now part of the metro system . 
  i linked to the german wiki sites because they contain the most pictures , other languages of course available . 
  transdanubia , the better vienna , 
  somewhat the same system in austria . 
  to become a hunter ( get a certificate that allows you to hunt ) you have to take an extensive course , covering not only gun safety but also deer management , environmental aspects etc. 
  there is a theoretical and practical exam , you need to be a good shot at clay-pidgon shooting f.ex . 
  instead of a region , we have a cake named after that : [ malakofftorte ] ( http://www.ichkoche.at/malakofftorte-rezept-222452 ), 
  not sure i agree . 
  while we were somewhat on track with enlightenment before the french revolution ( joseph ii is the most significant reformer here ) , the reaction after finaly defeating the french occupation was to crawl back into the `` safety of absolutism '' with the system metternich . 
  while i appreciate some of the napoleonic reforms ( system international as the most significant ) , i think in general it held us back on the parth to modernity . 
   they use the english name , just `` black friday '' well the german translation `` schwarzer freitag '' is the phrase used to describe stock market crashes , especially the one in 1929 that led to the economic crisis and subsequent raise of fascism , and days of great disasters in general [ - german wikepedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwarzer_freitag ) . 
  that 's not the best way to promote mindless shopping sprees . 
  maybe it 's the same way in spanish ? 
  about austria : i have only seen it for online shops , and i did n't see any offerings better than any other sales . 
  no , i am very happy we got rid of our emperors - and all aristocraty - at the end of wwi . 
  our bundespr\u00e4sident ( federal president ) is more of a figure-head of state , there to shake hands , wink and smile more then doing politics - that 's the bundeskanzlers job , so it is kind of a sudo-monarchy system .
