  but with the great advantage , that we do n't have to care about the presidents children that would automatically take over if we had a real monarchy . 
  i say that even now , when we have an enlongated presidental election and about a 49 % chance that some guy i do n't like will become the next president - at least i know that i will automatically get rid of him in 6 years . 
  edit : btw , we did n't kill our aristocracy in case anybody is wondering , they just are n't allowed to use arestocratiy titles any more . 
  and the nice castles of the habsburger now belong to everybody . 
  i do n't know anything about karlovy vary - bad hofgastein used to be a grand , expensive summer resort at the turn of the 19th/20th century but fell into a `` sleeping-beauty sleep '' since then . 
  a lot of the old hotels standing around empty . 
  compared to the top touristic ski regions in austria it is quite affordable . 
  stick out ? 
  yes , a bit , if your are beyond puperty age . 
  but having an unusual hair colour/hair cut/any voluntary body modification usually is n't done to best dissolve into crowds , but to stick out , is n't it ? 
  one thing you should be aware of : we have a different approach towards `` looking at people '' than us-americans : it is ok to look at people for a bit , without grinning at them , especially if they have unusual hair/cloth ... from many questions about `` staring '' it appears that americans interpret long looks at `` unfriendly staring '' - if your mum is already worried , she might jump to that conclusion . 
  in reality , people just like to anchor their 1000-yard-stare on something that looks a bit interesting . 
  if you are uncomfortable with a person looking at you for too long - just look back , and the person will look away , if they are not into chitchat mood . 
  and dispite the lack of `` american grinning '' , that was n't a starring match you just faught , but just a neutral encounter . 
  does duolingo teach pronunciation ? 
  anyways , you probably need to prove your knowledge with an exam from an approved source . 
  this is the german conditions for the university of vienna vor example http://studentpoint.univie.ac.at/zum-studium/voraussetzungen/deutschkenntnisse/,

  you have to prove that you have a good language level before you can even enroll in a state university .

  wild camping is not allowed in austria - what is allowed , but supposed to only be used if you have an emergancy/didn ' t make your hike in time is wild biwaking . 
  no campfires outside of dedicated campsites though . 
  what we have instead is a network of alpine huts - most of them with an inkeeper that offer basic places to sleep ( communal bunks ) and also meals for a smal price . 
  those huts are run by monaineering clubs like alpenverein , touristenclub and naturfreunde . 
  they also have some smaller non-managed huts resp . 
  you can borrow the keys to some of the huts if you want to go there outside of the season . 
  talk to your mountaineering friends , they are probably members of a sister club - they all mutually recognize each other . 
  interesting - the svp and all their anti-immigration referendums got a lot of coverage here , people being concerned the swiss `` are all going nazi '', 
  `` different race '' means that 2 individuals ca n't have fertile offspring : horses and donkeys are different races , they can have a baby ( mulish ) , but mulshes themselves are never fertile . 
  humans of all etnicities can have fertile babies , therefore they are not of different races , there is only one human race . 
  why is it so hard to admit ? 
  i see , the numbers are n't that high - in austria we had 90,000 asylum applications in the year 2015 alone , and even more people traveling through towards the north as long as germany had its border open .

  with `` online banking '' i ment a service provided by your bank , not some website of your landlord . 
  here - provided you did n't set up an automatic regular payment or something that allowed the company to order money from your account - typically you would be mailed somethink like this , called [ erlagschein ] ( http://www.raiffeisen-tirol.at/ebusiness/services/resources/media/1016407249002-na-863222639928392699-1-30-na.jpeg ) . 
  you then can either fill the handwritten part out with your account info , sing it and throw it in a box at your bank . 
  or you log in to the website of your bank and fill out a form online ordering the payment to the companies account . 
  - i thought that was an universal system . 
  but ca n't you just pay that via online banking , like paying a paymentform online ? 
  better than that : served in half a baguette - which is hollowed and toasted on those [ toast sticks ] ( http://picture.yatego.com/images/4641c81b016fa6.5/ef73c1eff63ddfcdd3fc3d9a258cd51f-kqh/casselin-elektrische-hot-dog-maschine-aus-edelstahl-960-watt-mit-4-brotwrmern.jpg ) ( please ignore the sad looking shadows of a sausage on the right of the picture ) . 
  usually you can choose between at least a frankfurter , bratwurst and k\u00e4sekrainer , maybe debreziner , klobasse ... served with mustard and/or kechup in the bagettue .

   they pretty much are n't a thing here at all . 
  really ? 
  they are a staple at traditional w\u00fcrstelst\u00e4nde here . 
  til - i was just shocked to recently find out they still exist in the us . 
  i have never seen a check irl , just knew them from old columbo movies etc. 
  and had thought they stopped being a think by the 70ties . 
   i consider myself a proud patriot see , here we have another reason : in our perspective only people who have n't achieved anythink they can be proud of in their life themselves need to fall back on being proud on the country they happened to be born in . 
  6 ) having to register in advance to even be allowed to vote is n't the best - instead we are sent an invitation/instruction without ever having to do something first . 
  7 ) long lines at some polling stations - i assume in poorer neighbourhoods - looks like soft voter suppression . 
  8 ) first past the post , winner takes it all systems are bad at delivering what people really voted for . 
  especially in your presidental election people in a few states decide the fate for everyone else , while most peoples vote really `` does n't count '' and third parties have no chance . 
  [ gcp grey - the trouble with the electoral college ] ( https://youtu.be/7wc42hgla4k ) & [ update ] ( https://youtu.be/zczttb10_vo ), 
   i am no ukip supporter , but the feels , when you have to `` defend '' a political party you despise yourself but some outsider perspective that they are `` literaly voldemort '' are just too exaggerated . 
  reminds me of the time of our black-blue coalition . 
  uk , i feel with you . 
  true  election probably would n't be valid without the correct titles on the paper, 
  this was the [ ballot paper of our first round of the presidental election this year ] ( http://www.salzburg24.at/2016/04/themenbild-stimmzettel-f%c3%9cr-die-bundespr%c3%84sidentschaftswahl-meldungsliste1-apa-bilderdienst-06.04.16-08.01-abd0011-vollbild.jpg ) the [ ballot paper for parlamential election ] ( http://cdn1.vienna.at/2013/09/zettel-650x435.jpg ) looks a bit more complicated because you can change the order of the candidates of your favoured party . 
  it might be official , but do you think it is the right thing to do ? 
  it would n't sit well with me , if one country suddenldy called themselves `` europe '' in short and `` european '' . 
  do n't you think it is quite imperialistic to use the name of a huge doublecontinent for your country as well ? 
   grocery store/bank/drug store and such all within a mile yes , i have 4 different grocery stors within 500m , 2 of them right next to my underground stop , so i can shop there on my way home in the evening . 
  i never have counted the shops within an 1.6 km radius . 
  i commute to work via public transport , that takes me 1/2h - taking a car would probalby take the same time during rush hour , but add the extra time of searching for a parking space or cost of a parking garage . 
  i have my `` shaby '' bike locked in front of the house for short distances within my area - or , if i am lazy , for the distance to the underground station . 
  for trips to the countryside i am a member of a carsharing company . 
  i am living on the outskirts of a big city - predominantly residental area ( with all the shops etc. 
  you might need ) but few office space or industry . 
  budapest and prag are a bit far by european standards ( 4h each ) , but you can easily take daytrips to western hungarian towns , i 'd suggest brno/br \u00fcnn in czech republic and already mentioned bratislava - if you want by hydrofoil http://www.twincityliner.com/en . 
  as well as daytrips within austria - how about [ partly rebuilt roman excravations ] ( http://www.carnuntum.at/en?set_language=en ) . 
  the wachau could also by explored by boat - or hinking , biking - do n't know your mums fitness level https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wachau . 
  there are castles in every direction and so on ... 
  was thinking of [ this ] ( http://www.taz.de/picture/363661/948/tempo_b.jpg ) - germans often say `` tempo '' instead of `` taschentuch `` because it 's the most common brand . 
  and they are definitly a thing during the cold season . 
   kids like dressing up in costumes do n't you have carneval for that ? 
  damn helloween killed weltspartag though :(, 
  same here . 
  as the next day is off , it 's actually not such a bad idea to go to a party - at least for those folks , that do n't plan to drive far the next day for the commemoration of deceased relatives . 
  you are mixing up `` access to the single market '' with any `` trade agreement '' . 
  actually we did . 
  at our second year of seriously learning english ( age 11 ) we had a teacher who made us learn little 4-liners by heart . 
  the textbook we had had those little poems at the end of every chapter - making use of some of the grammar and vocabulary that was taught in the chapter . 
  we did n't have to remember it for long - only as part of the homework whenever we reached the end of a chapter . 
  as a kid i hated it - but i think it helped us a lot at that low level of language ability , as it applied what we just had learned and solidified it in our brains . 
  i have the feeling that in austria the hype dies down again - what i appreciate, 
  no renaissance festivals ? 
  well , because for us history started before the renaissance , we have mostly midddle age festivals - i quite like the one in eggenburg due to the rather middle-age like layout of the town surrounded by a city wall : [ mittelalterfest eggenburg ] ( https://youtu.be/1nmjblfphly ) but we have also an roman festival , at the excavation site of a formar big roman city [ r\u00f6merfest carnuntum ] ( https://youtu.be/vuzgp8eiwdk ) or the one spanning 7 centuries of military history at our military museum [ montur und pulverdampf ] ( https://youtu.be/rn-yp4d7mf0 ) just to name the ones in/near vienna i liked . 
  there is no single ugly austrian neighborhood to find on streetview . 
  well , there is no streetview of austria , after to many people were concerned about their privacy , google lost interest . 
  of course you should be looking both ways , but on which lane a car will cross your trajectory plays an important role in estimating whether it is safe to cross or not . 
  you asked for reasons tourists decide to wait instead of jaywalking , i am giving you one . 
  you claming that  so although people keep raising it in the the thread , the factor of the traffic driving on the opposite side of the road should be eliminated looks rather pathetic . 
   even when the irish cross , many tourists still wo n't move . 
  cars coming from the `` wrong '' side of the road is an important factor here . 
  while i can confidently judge that it is safe to cross at home ( still wo n't do it if kids watch , who ca n't estimate the speed of cars yet ) it 's scary on those islands . 
  during a short vaccation i do n't really get used to looking to the other directions for cars , all i can master is to be aware that there `` cars come out of nowhere from unexpected places all of the time '' . 
  are you talking about the cubes or the black liquid ?
