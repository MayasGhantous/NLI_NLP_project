  if the liquid , that 's not how we do it here ( putting it in the pot ) - rather , at the table everyone individually seasons their soup to perfection . 
   us-americans is quite a mouthful . 
  huh ? 
  what would you suggest instead ? 
  finding [ maggi ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/maggiw%c3%bcrze-neu.jpg ) on every table next to salt and pepper to as seasoning for soup . 
  pretty standard and often only vegetarian dish in austrian pubs as well - but i guess we do share a cultural sphere, 
  also we have been to a pool regularly with school one year in primary school and one year in middle school . 
  there were 2-3 kid 's that could n't swim ( out of 3 primary school classes ) - those were kids with parents from other countries . 
  usually you learn to swimm at a young age from your parents . 
   i also do n't think the eu really likes canada at the moment , with the trade deal talks not going well is this really how ceta criticism gets across in canada ? 
  because that 's not at all how people feel here . 
  ceta is criticised because it gives multinational corporations ( on both sides of the pond ) much to much powers about populations and states ( both european and canada ) . 
  being against ceta is trying to protect european and canadian people . 
   concept image red bull product placement everywhere , 
   do people not order just coffee there ? 
  no - it 's like going into a pizzaria and ordering `` pizza '' or a steak house and ask for `` steak '' [ this ] ( http://www.tourmycountry.com/austria/coffee.htm ) is a list of the standard varieties . 
  ( first i found in english on google , maybe somebody has a better link ), 
  do you know who made [ pinoccio ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gdolynia4y ) ? 
  i could n't find it on imdb edit : found it - zdf , orf and nippon animation studios https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/pinocchio_ ( 1976 ), 
  direct link : http://www.hgm.at/en.html, 
  i think you should switch on a flair, 
  hm , now that i think of it , i 'm not sure . 
  oh , do i need to watch the movie again ? 
  at least the first minutes ... 
   hairy women have you seen `` home alone '' ( kevin allein zu haus ) ? 
  that 's where i learnd that stereotype and that hair on legs are supposed to be ghastly at a very young age . 
  that campain did improve things , but we started at a very shitty level . 
  what makes you think that countries/regions that `` a solo travler of any gender '' or `` any traveler '' should avoid do n't apply as valid answers here ? 
  the question was n't `` coutries that famales - and only females - should avoid while it 's perfectly safe for males '' . 
  we have far too many dogs in the city , they poop everywhere . 
  but that 's my own opinion - most other people have dogs . 
  lol, 
  for snow ? 
   even as a regular citizen ( male ) there 's not a single neighborhood or street in the whole country i would n't go to , at any time of the day or night . 
  same for me ( a woman ), 
  yes , european first , my federal state second , my country third, 
  austria too, 
  why not ask that in a british sub ? 
  til we actually [ have one thanks to a recent crowdfunding campaign ) ( http://www.austriansuperheroes.com/ash-oesterreichisches-superhelden-projekt-durchbricht-crowdfunding-grenze/ ) i could n't find a description about the super powers though - has anybody looked into it and can tell us ? 
  `` literally hitler '' would have been a rare case where this is a correct statement , but you passed the chance , 
  we have even [ films ] ( https://youtu.be/sd7gsos8p4k ) dedicated to them . 
  you misunderstood , we read all that in ( german ) literature class - german versions of course . 
  i 'm sure there are english versions of this classics as well . 
  kind of disappointing that you guys do n't expand your horizon above originally english literature in your school system . 
  had i taken latin or ancient greek i would have read a lot of additional texts in the original language . 
  `` lord of the flies '' , `` of mice and men '' are 2 ( both simplified to our level ) of the many books we read in english class , and some seriously simpified molier in french class . 
  `` starting at '' 19 euros !!!, 
  there are about 20 tickets for that price , when they are gone , there will be some slightly cheaper-than-normal ones , and then the only the normal priced ones . 
  agreed - here is one example : the austrian train service offers reduced tickets called `` sparschiene '' for fast trains ( the ones where you need to pay extra with en eurail pass ) to other european cities . 
  the catch is : that ticket is only valid for one specific day and one specific departure time . 
  and there is a limited number of this tickets - book as soon as possible . 
  october/november is sure an easier time to get those tickets then summer . 
  a day train starts at 19 , a night train at 29 - a couchette starts at 39 , i think - but at the same time you safe on a hostel . 
  edit : forgot the link : http://www.oebb.at/en/angebote-ermaessigungen/sparschiene-europa, 
   `` good '' , `` fine , thanks '' = neutral cultural difference detected  follow up question : so , how do you express `` good '' or `` fine '' - do you have to rely on superlatives like `` great , awesome , increadible , best time of my life ... '' ? 
  eam , what would be the reaction you expected to such a behaviour ? 
  if you were walking past them , are n't you too far away by the time they can answer you ? 
  or do you expect of them to take the time stopping to give a total stranger a dishonest answer ? 
  there are some important variables op did n't give : costline or mountains , vibrant city life with lots of cultural program or empty nature , a spot where you might meet lots of other pensioners from all over , or just `` authentic '' country folks ? 
  it appears you gravely underestimate that difference speaking different languages makes : you will consume different media - different tv stations , different newspapers , read different books , have different traditional music . 
  your history lessons will gravely be different , focus on your own country and use your countries perspective on the world , you will generally have very different school systems ... and i could go on forever . 
  despite bein neighbours , i only learnt about him when you put him on the 2 euro coin . 
  not any ? 
  in german literature , we start with ancient greece ( we read antigone for example , and the odysee , and also had little stops in other importent european literature ( dantes divine comedy for example , machiavellis the prince etc. ), 
  the way you pronounce the name eugen, 
  maybe sent them a mail : [ migay ] ( http://www.migay.at/de/projekte ) - if they ca n't help you , they sure know who you need to talk to - one of their activities `` aufbau eines internationalen netzwerks zur unterst\u00fctzung queerer migrant_innen weltweit '', 
  also `` ich versteh ' nur spanisch '' = `` i only understood spanish '' meaning `` i did n't understand anything '', 
  to enrole to a german university you probably need to proof that you understand german quite well , that 's at least the case in austrian universities . 
  b2 is usually minimum, 
  agreed , also `` eu-citizen '' exists as a term . 
  apart from that i refuse to use `` america '' and `` american '' to describe one country only . 
  it is my mission to bring the nice term `` us-amercian '' into the english language . 
  is / r/yurop leaking ? 
  we should start a club, 
  before the 2004 enlargement some rightwingers tried to spread fear of the `` masses comming over and taking all our jobs '' - but the transitional restrictions helped keeping those at bay , and afterwards people saw that those mass migration is n't happening . 
  while some dogy under-the-book paying-below-minimum-wage jobs are happening , especially in construction industry , the blame here is not been put manly on the eu-citizens that would take those jobs ( because they are still payed a little better than what they could make at home ) but with the employer . 
  some task forces have been formed to find and punish those employers . 
  glad to hear that . 
  i was afraid a `` i actually do n't like the thing you asked about '' answer would n't be welcome . 
  definetly try a `` semmel '' if you can get hold of a fresh one . 
  they are also frequently filled with cold cuts , cheese alone , a slice of pork roast or anything else you can think of . 
  [ d\u00f6ner ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=d%c3%b6ner&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjrmpfmoq7pahwgfrokhrreaakq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#tbm=isch&amp;q=d%c3%b6ner+kebab ) is also a great snack food here . 
  leberk\u00e4se is highly processed , so we are probably talking about the same thing . 
  k\u00e4seleberk\u00e4s contains pockets of melted cheese . 
  i am not really keen on seeing what goes into the leberk\u00e4se , but it is delicious still . 
  the word `` semmel '' refers either to a kaisersemmel , or a langsemmel looking like the zemlija you linked . 
  i do n't like hamburgers , much prefer mashed potatoes + steamed vegetables with my rissoles . 
  as an on-the-go unhealty comfort food , i 'd have a [ k\u00e4sleberk\u00e4ssemmel ] ( http://hellomagyarok.hu/assets/media/news/1000/20150806152429.jpg ) with pickled ghirkin - the crunchy semmel is much more to my liking than those sad-soft-sweet hamburger buns , and k\u00e4seleberk\u00e4se is probably the tastiest thing on this planet - and now i am hungry thinking of it . 
  any citys ? 
  if you post , where you want to go to , somebody might be able to tell you the best train connection . 
  let me rephrase : are you looking for a connection between city a to city b : there is usually the one national company running the show . 
  you maybe can choose between a fast train ( servicing only a few stops ) that might be more expensive and a slower one ( stoping everywhere ) - depending on the sytem in the specific country , prices might also be the same for both . 
  or are you looking for a sashay train ride ( like a nostalgia mountain train ) for a daytrip ? 
  what is `` best '' ? 
  are you looking for the most convenient , modern , comfortable train or the most scenic view , the olderst steam train , cog railway etc. 
  beeing a good football player or orera singer also helps, 
  well , in german we say `` pils '' for the style of beer , but `` pilsner '' refers to the brand `` pilsner urquell '', 
  austria is not part of the nato and hardly anybody here wants to join it - it is viewed as the helper troop for us invasions that we do n't want to be a part of . 
  the opinion on an eu-army is devided and generally more flexible for arguments for and against than nato membership . 
  because i do n't like white bread that goes stale within hours , but prefer a nice rye bread instead .
