  what we expect is that the state protects people from mobs . 
  the police was called to the hotel but decided to not show up for one hour and then the sent only one car . 
  but their police force decided not to protect the festival , sent only 1 car after an hour - so i would say shame on lviv officals .

  well , that 's much closer than austrialia - where goods ordered to austria far too often end up . 
  what i do know : since a few month police is ordered to stand around at praterstern and all the other train stations and are probably quite bored by now . 
  great timelaps, 
  i am quite surprised about the austrian numbers as well . 
  there are some people who hunt half-professionally and the napoleonic wars left us with [ traditional self-defense-groups in tirol ] ( http://www.kleinezeitung.at/images/uploads_520/b/f/2/4652018/c391b032-a8e3-4d96-87ad-316fdd6715ec_v0_h.jpg ) , but those should only add up to a small portion of our population . 
  i made it a habit never to answer a poll over the phone ( land line or mobile ) - not because i am afraid of my government , but wonder who else the company doing the survey might sell the data to . 
  playing [ datadealer ] ( http://datadealer.com/ ) made me a bit `` paranoid '' - but i think rightfully so, 
  well , if they do n't want it , more schweinsbraten for me , 
  ... and large scale power blackouts due to heavy snowfalls ( according to our tv news ), 
  it still is, 
   i thought austrian channels use dual sound channels they might now , i have n't owned a tv in years , so i have n't followed the changes with digital tv , hd tv , ... closely . 
  the `` when i was growing up '' was refering to the 90ties . 
  back then , broadcasting in 2 languages meant you could send the audio tracks only in mono . 
  it really was only the golden girls for years . 
  than they experimented with optional eglish language on thurstday nighs with jamie oliver - who was very difficult to understand for me afer a few years of school english . 
  ad torrenting : as netflix or any other streaming services did n't bother offering their services in austria , there was literary no way to pay for streaming without having to lie about youre wherebouts . 
  but a very leniant law on torrenting ... edit : southpark ~ ~ was ~ ~ has been leagally available for years http://www.southpark.de/alle-episoden but growing up , the only show that was broadcasted on `` dual sound channel '' was golden girls . 
  [ wikipedia entry `` dual language '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dual_language ) - and no , i did not just type that up to prove you wrong . 
  rough translation : as a consequence the city wants to improve safety for mass events . 
  the city and the police need to set measurements that `` such incidents never happen again '' reker said . 
  ** woman and girls have to be able to celebrate carneval in cologne without any feeling of insecurity ** `` we do n't want unsecurable locations here . '', 
  it needs to stay a city `` in which everybody is able to celebrate '' . 
  austria now is the only country in the world that has shared adoption rights but no marriage rights . 
  the difference between civil partnership and marriage became smaller and smaller over the year due to lots of court victories for human rights . 
  - it appears our gouvernment ( s ) have more than enough money to waste on court cases instead of simply establishing equal rights by law . 
  i thought in italy a witch is bringing the presents ? 
   but is actually a totally different person well , santa claus is a malapropism of the dutch version of st niklaus : sintaklaas - so they are not at all two different persons , but the american santa is a commercialized and 3 weeks late nikolaus . 
  - i do n't know where they have got the north pole idea from , maybe from the father frost . 
  the question `` increased trade between america and the eu is a good thing '' is misleading - does it ask if i approve of ttip or of `` real '' trade ? 
  as the general consensus is that ttip is hardly about trade improvements and mostly about raising the power of multinationals . 
   we will see what will happen agreed - i suspect the main reason for building some fence-thingy is to show to the frightened part of our citizens that the polititians do `` something '' - wether that `` something '' is totally pointless is not important . 
   how the narrative changes the main reason for these `` changes '' is the oversimplification in international media from `` politician a in country b says '' to `` country b says '' . 
  first chancellor feymann ( socialist party ) was quick in critisizing hungary , now interior minister mikl-leitner ( conservative party ) demands a fence . 
  neither changed their minds , but oversimlified reporting makes it look like `` country b has changed corse 180 \u00b0 '', 
  we are talking about something totally different : it is not planned to fence of the entire green border but just a few km around the official border crossings . 
  quote from the article :  mikl-leitner said ... that the fence would be `` solid and stretch several kilometres left and right of the border crossing '' i imagine they plan something like an oversized version the queue guides in front of disney land attraction - otherwise i do n't see the point in erecting just a little bit of fence near the boarder crossings . 
  it is not a `` fence '' because it is not planned to fence of the entire green border but just a few km around the official border crossings .

  interesting - so the main difference of the story is that the austrian guy survived - he wore white cloth because it being a crussade , and the latvian guy died and was put on a besheet . 
  i think our origin story would fit better to the latvian flag ( darker red , the white stripe is slimmer ) than our own . 
  is there an origin story for the latvian flag ? 
   i do n't trust german/austrian/scandinavians politicians to be brave enough to quickly allow an intervention or a military operation . 
  they come from countries in which the political climate opposes foreign military interventions . 
  which will translate in reluctance for an intervention , which could be counter-productive . 
  i think you are onto something here . 
  in austria , doubt about a common european military comes from both sides - the anti-intervention side fears we might become involved in some overly agressive worldpolicing - having compulsary military service makes that particulary unpopular ( despite a conscript would never be sent abroad ) while the pro-invention side thinks all wars would be over before the slow eu institutions could decide on doing something . 
  what 's your point ? 
   i am tired and hungry . 
  for me that sounds like an argument to order a pizza and not start cooking a fancy dinner . 
   the car was filled to the maximum , i had to throw away several boxes of stuff that i could n't fit . 
  so you want to fill it with addidional shopping ? 
  could also have stopped at a gas station which is outfitted like a mini shop for easy food items . 
  so you need to order food for the days you `` move into a new apartment '' - big deal, 
  no worries , we just take beethoven instead , 
  this  when a brit reacts to a proposal by saying , `` that 's interesting '' a fellow brit might recognise this as understatement for , `` that 's rubbish . '' but other nationalities would take the word `` interesting '' on face value ,, 
  not really a cake , but we have [ allerheiligenstriezel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allerheiligenstriezel ) in austra - a slightly sweet yeast pastry . 
  the pictures provided on wikipedia are not the best . 
  what do you mean with neutral ? 
  i 'd suppose a law professor is neutral at the beginning , that looks at the subject at hand and finally forms an opinion . 
  by definition anybody who has anything to add to a topic ca n't be `` neutral '' any longer . 
  what is important is that those professors do n't have any money to gain/loose in the process - other than lobbyists for example , buttering up canadian and eu politicians for years . 
  very true - i do n't expect anybody without a law degree to comprehend those details . 
  because of that i am looking for people with those i can trust - for example if [ 101 law professors sign a statement against isdss - details in the link in english , french , german , italian and spanish ] ( https://stop-ttip.org/blog/legal-statement-on-investment-protection-in-ttip-and-ceta/ )  `` the investment protection systems in ttip and ceta pose an unnecessary , and grave , threat to democracy and the public interest . 
  the tribunal system included in ceta , and proposed for ttip , is better than the arbitration provided for in many other investment treaties , but it does not eliminate the risk of an excessively broad interpretation of investor rights . 
  given the quality of judicial review in the domestic legal systems of the parties , it is also unnecessary to establish an international tribunal that grants investors privileged access . 
  it is for these reasons that i call for the investor protection systems to be eliminated from both ttip and ceta , '' states signatory professor nico krisch from the graduate institute geneva . 
   overviews , summaries when the devil is in the details , all this can achieve is to falsly appease righful criticisms . 
  heyhey , kommissar rex was austrian, 
  maybe , but stealing them from you would result in a car with the driver seat in the wrong place . 
  yes , before shooting towards a person you need to make a warning shot . 
  it that doe n't make them stop you can shoot at them , but aim on their feet , hoping not to kill them . 
  i will ask them if there are situations ( like the perpetrator is already harming somebody severely ) where you can omit the warning shot . 
  in the leg , just like the policemen in br\u00fcssel, 
  that might be true for your country , but not for the european police force . 
  here , if you are seriously threatened by a man with a knive , you shoot him in a way where he ca n't run towards you . 
  `` shooting to wound '' is definitly what you want to achieve .

  [ from 2000 to 2005 ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwarz-blaue_koalition ) if you define `` far right '' as the fp\u00d6 regarding austria . 
  i am no friend of the fp\u00d6 - i think they are an incompetent bunch of people who want to enrich themselves on a right-populist agenda like we have seen in the years 2000-2005 . 
  courts are not finished yet with convicting those involved . 
  but i think it is rich that americans are swinging the nazi-club when in fact the political agenda of donald trump is far more xenophobic and hate-inducing than anything the fp\u00d6 is demanding . 
  the words are correct , `` saft '' means just juice in general , to specify fruit juice you should say fruchtsaft , however i have never heared of paprikasch - but googeling it i could find rather different recipies in german .

  thats strange indeed - i assume your school book is not 70 + years old ? 
  the radionuclides used in hospitals have mostly a halflife of hours to days , not millions of years like the heavy elements used in nuclear power plants . 
  - radioactive waste from hospitals might be a problem now , but if you stop producing/dumping it , the problem goes away within a month . 
  the radioactive waste from power plants will be a massive problem for generations to generations of people to come .
