  hungary , why ? 
  the old ones are even worse : `` something-office '' sounds rather random , i whould n't have guessed there is a government department behind it . 
  the austrian ones at least all contain the word `` ministerium '', 
   why this narrative `` poles were in the jews-killing business together with germans '' is promoted so insistently by american and german publishers and media ? 
  why is the narrative of the armenian genocide repeated in western media ? 
  because there is a revisionist history going on in these coutnries - claiming your people were all heroic human-savers and nobody did anything wrong . 
  stop revisionist history , own up to past mistakes , and nobody will find the need to opose state-propaganda any longer . 
  pot calling the cattle black ? 
  i had to laugh out loud - have an upvote, 
  listen to the same old jokes for 50 years first ... 
   i do n't know if it would be doable in vienna prostitution is legal and regulated in vienna, 
  you will have to pass vienna first - bring coffee  edit : i 'm refering to [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5yeh5m/whats_caf%c3%a9_culture_in_your_country_like/depdnus/?st=j07bpvdp&amp;sh=2eda174b ), 
  if you burn all those `` french '' flags , the cheese might melt nicely, 
  question to the dutch : how much is that also a domestic-policy move ? 
  - so close to the election thwarting wilders , so sending more of a message to the voters that they do n't need to go far-right to oppose erdogan . 
  til how sound of music got the awfull idea of `` schnitzel with nudel '' two wrongs do n't make it right here, 
  happened to me once many many years ago , somewhere in the north , i do n't recall where - in a cheaper canteen-like restaurant . 
  j\u00e4gerschnitzel as non-breaded with mushroom sauce is ok also in austrian eyes . 
  maybe the root of the misunderstanding is that with `` schnitzel '' we assume `` wiener schnitzel '' or at least its pork variety while some regions in germany treat `` schnitzel '' as `` could be j\u00e4gerschnitzel '' ? 
  nice idea but quite an odd choice on which mountain peaks , lakes and points of interest it mentions and which it leaves out . 
  the biggest lake ( bodensee ) does n't get a name for example , neither is the highest mountain . 
   and many people order a schnitzel with sauce the problem is that when ordering schnitzel in germany it often happens that it automatically comes with sauce all over the schnitzel ruining the entire dish to unsuspecting foreigners . 
  how am i not arguing in favour of the children 's best interests ? 
  denying adopton rights is denying the kids the right to have a family . 
  if for example children from a former mixed-sex relationship can not be adopted by the new partner you are denying the kids a second parent . 
  if same-sex foster parents ca n't adopt their kids you are denying the kids the safety of a `` real '' family . 
  i wonder if the article even is correct in calling it `` marriage '' . 
  a slovene person in this thread explained that it is in fact still not called marriage but something like civil partnership . 
  i googled a bit - [ sn gives much more info ] ( http://www.salzburg.com/nachrichten/welt/politik/sn/artikel/aufwertung-homosexueller-partnerschaften-in-slowenien-235972/ ) : stil civil partnership , but much better then their previous one : the old law had 70 differerences to marriage , now it is mostly the same ( apart from adoption and name ) . 
  also the situation for not registered same-sex partnerships is now equal to non-married mixed-sex partnerships . 
  i blame my buddy freud, 
  you too are talking about differend kinds of `` evangelical '' : die evangelische kirche a.b. 
  would be tranlated to `` protestant church '' or lutherans while the english speaking world when speaking about `` evangelicals '' usually means `` taking the bible literal '' - nutjobs . 
  it 's not about `` who is better '' but about equal rights for everybody . 
  what i want to say is that marriage is n't all there is on the way to full equality . 
   i suppose due to our history hm , not necessarily due to communism - because in austria it is the same : if you want to marry ( legally valid ) , you go to a civil servant . 
  whether or not you do any religious services ( before or after ) does n't do anything to your marital status . 
  people who plan to do an additional religious service usually keep the civil marrige service as short as possible and often just bring the w ~ ~ h ~ ~ itnesses while those who do n't have a longer service with music , a speech by the marriage registrar and bring all their friends . 
  agreed that we should have made marriage legal instead of `` eingetragene partnerschaft '' - however marriage should not be treated as the litmus test for equality - at least equally as important is the right to adopt , outlawing inequal treatment by employers etc - which we both have for example in austria, 
  [ asterix & obelix at an austrian administration ] ( https://youtu.be/liiur2gv0xk?t=1m51s ), 
   bosnian is not the same as bosniak . 
  could you explain please ? 
  can someone explain the `` german with a dutch disease '' for swiss german to me ? 
  i once had a flemish person tell me that swiss german is easier for him to understand then austrian or german german - is this a common trend ? 
  the reason it has `` that disney look '' is that disney copied this very castle in their logo . 
  ( and i agree that neuschwanstein looks that `` fantasy castle like '' because it is a reimagined piece of historism architecture ) . 
  [ yes ] ( https://youtu.be/olwwsultvnk ), 
  can confirm . 
  when ordering food in a mountain hut on our most eastern skiable mountains you are most probably served by an hungarian waiter . 
  hardly any of the countries on the map was present in its current form when they `` invaded '' . 
   my post was sarcasm . 
  sorry o i noticed , no reason to apologise  mine was sarcastic also , at least insofar that i would n't suggest the french way of getting rid of your royal overloards . 
  but would n't it be easier to visit the royal palace - also the inside - once you throw out your royal family ? 
  sch\u00f6nbrunn and hofburg are among the top visited places in vienna . 
  oh , i thought it was at least a larger park , like [ minimundus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/minimundus ), 
   most of the exiles went to britain and america , where they were often gratefully received . 
  a wee bit of whitewashing going on here ? 
  just the richest , best educated people were welcome to bribe their way to asylum there , [ while the `` normal jews '' were sent back into the holocaust even when on a ship just before miami ] ( http://blog.adl.org/greenblatt/closing-the-borders-to-refugees-wrong-in-the-1930s-and-wrong-today ), 
  maybe \u00d6sterland is more agreeable then . 
   its a czech traditional ritual . 
  til czechs secrately are german, 
  yes , the `` doing nothing and letting court take care of it '' - strategy is something copied here . 
  i do n't know what they are waiting for . 
  civil unions have become very close to marrige , there are full adoption rights , yet the \u00d6vp still has n't signed full marrige equality in . 
  the majority of the general population is for it , the majority of catholics is for it , i do n't know what is holding them back . 
  for that reason people kept it alive in the bath tub : carp likes to live in muddy waters , so if you kill it right after catching it , it will taste like that . 
  keeping it in fresh water for some time will get rid of that . 
  asylum and citizenship are two very different things . 
  i think that being somewhat part of the anlgosphere made them a target for those `` therapies '' in the first place , making it even necessary to ban it . 
  according to this map , it sould be renamed ** uncommon law ** though, 
  about comparing : i know nothing about the us green party , so i ca n't compare . 
  in our media coverage of the us presidental election they were only briefly mentioned as `` those people also run for president , but have no chance in their electoral system '' . 
  the greens in austria are probaly more `` left '' than the sp\u00d6 , but in general they are more concearn with environmental topics , but also focus on an inclusive society . 
  they are the most vocal about lgbt rights , an austrian green party member , [ ulrike lunacek ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulrike_lunacek ) is vice president of the european parlament and probably austrias top non-straight politician . 
  as he seems to be only afraid of hammer + sickle , i only mentioned them . 
  there are of corse also the broken chains , a brick crown and a shield on the bird . 
  hammer and sickle already is part of our national coat of arms since 1919 , no need for the green party there . 
  about our green parties politics - i guess , you do n't understand german ? 
  if you do , or want to use a translator here is [ their political program ] ( https://www.gruene.at/partei/programm/parteiprogramm ) for the vienna elections they published a short program in english [ pdf ] ( https://www.gruene.at/partei/programm/wahlprogramme/ep-wahlprogramm-kurz-englisch.pdf ), 
  for a change , we do the anschluss the other way around now , 
  because international press was only interested in a `` austria is so nazi '' headline . 
  if they did n't fly to austia to vote in person , their vote is n't even counted yet - postal ballots must stay closed and uncounted until tomorrow, 
  at 5 the last polling stations in vienna and innsbruck closed , but polling stations in small villages had already started closing at 12 . 
  - those smaller stations had already finished counting , but only at 5 sharp they were allowed to give the results to the media . 
  originally it was expected that the result might be too close to have a result soon after 5 , but the results are clear enough . 
  you misunderstood . 
  nothing about right populist politics is inclusive . 
  the green party candidate ( though techically independent ) alexander van der bellen is standing for an inclusive society , with equal rights for lgbt , women , minorities etc. 
  yet the media does n't pay attention to that at all . 
  they are not painting a picture about what good that can be achieved with such policies , they just repeat all the bullshit the right populists are saying - the other side is just a `` defence against that '' . 
  they are writhing that a fp\u00d6 president would be a shift to the right of austrian society - yet a green president would be an equally significant shift to the left - but never in any media , domestic or foreign , have i seen any mentioning of that . 
  not dropout , he was n't even exepted in, 
  ugh , they needed to include 5 nazi flags and one portrait of hitler in that little 1min video . 
  sure , hofer is a disgusting populist right winger , like so many in todays western world . 
  but he is not litteraly hitler . 
  also they did n't inform on any of the policies of the green party candidate who already won the election . 
  just staring on the right right wing candidates like in hypnotic snake eyes is probably not the best way forward to an inclusive , forward-thinking europe . 
  edit : one letter removed, 
  not to my knowledge , but wikipedia states that there was once the idea of `` v4 plus '' including austria and slovenia , but hungary objected , so czech republic , slovakia ( not mixing them up here ! ), 
  and austria founded their own club called [ `` austerlitz format '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/visegr%c3%a1d-gruppe ) i doubht that anything substantial will happen there .
