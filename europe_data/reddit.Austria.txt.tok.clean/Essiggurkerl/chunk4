  but none of the candidates wants to make austro-hungary great again :'( / s for the crying smiley, 
  and this is his famous house - [ the `` house without eyebrows '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/loos-haus_wien.jpg ) - looks ordinary today but was a real scandal when it was built , windows without any ornaments around them . 
  probably did n't help that is stands right next to the imperial palace . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/looshaus ) available in several languages but not english wi, 
  the fact that turkey keeps several german journalists in prison might help . 
  thanks - it 's like a german au then, 
  `` au di li '' for austria - is that a german au or a-u , or an o like in the english word for austria ? 
  true, 
  yes , it 's mind-boggling considering we derive most of our national identity from geing `` different then germany '', 
  hm , while / austria is the subreddit about topics concerning austria , / de is n't - it 's the german language subreddit for all the german speaking countries - topics do n't have to concern the dach countries, 
  good - so we can have equal marriage soon - because for some reason our politicians ca n't do anything before germany has done it . 
  yes , asterix in fact is austrian, 
  [ years of playing video games tought them that 's more then enough protection for women ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9f/d7/83/9fd78351fdacda4c18e0451c1988bc0c.jpg ), 
  copying the `` best '' parts of us culture ... 
  proof ? 
  in fact , last year there was a kind of `` christian pride parade '' = [ marsch f\u00fcr jesus ] ( http://wien.orf.at/news/stories/2780823/ ) by chance on the same date going on at the same ring street . 
  both demonstrations happened peacefully , without disturbing each other . 
  so no , we do n't have a problem with that - why should we ? 
  a big baloon animal ? 
  turns out they were secretly planning a surprise party for erdogan , not a coup, 
  vienna can into nordic, 
  yes it is , sandro is a special snowflake, 
  here deka are omnipresent - in cookbooks in the ingredient lists , and you use it in the supermarked when buying open stuff `` 10 deka ... bacon and 10 deka ... sausage please '', 
  but deka ( gramm ) are very popular, 
   to experience something wholly familiar in a way entirely different to what one is accustomed . 
  that 's one of the best parts of travelling !, 
  totally agree with that notion - i would suggest eating `` chinese '' ( chinese bend to local tasts ) wherever you travel : the differences you notice give a good introduction to how local coisine works . 
  stricter food laws force them, 
  all right - that 's just what the author of the linked novel also thought and took at a setting of his story . 
  are you refering to this [ crime novel ] ( https://www.rowohlt.de/buch/kurt_palm_bad_fucking.2858965.html ) ? 
  in won a price , but the plot sounds rather trashy - is it any good ? 
  at least there still is a sign, 
  agreed , but you ca n't easily change your gender to enter a `` one gender only '' event, 
  let me play devils advocat here : if an organization rents rooms for an event , why should n't they have the right to decide who is allowed and who is n't ? 
  there are furry events where you are only allowed in in costume , saunas where you need to be naked , gay men and gay womans parties where only one gender is allowed in etc. 
  let 's compromise and say black-faced ( painted ) people also can come . 
  maybe there is an equivalent to https://geizhals.at/ ? 
  that site manages to rank the sellers by price including shipping cost - including amazon . 
  proving amazon hides that information deliberatly . 
  i give you [ kaiserin maria theresia ] ( http://1gr.cz/fotky/idnes/15/023/org/evs597bb2_obraz2.jpg ) - pupils hate her , because she made us go to school since 1775, 
  i appreciate that he did this during a `` bonus '' song , and not a song in the competition - potentially hampering a contenstant . 
  no , in table foodball is colloqually called wuzler , the verb is wuzeln , pronounce it wuz ` ln . 
  catholic austria here - i am not aware of any `` alcohol/other special things are forbidden to be sold today '' laws or costums in my country - shops are either open or closed . 
  how is the situation in poland ? 
   \u041f\u043e\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b\u0438 [ pronunciation ] ( https://forvo.com/word/%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%b5%d1%85%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8/#ru ), 
  you 'd need a time machine . 
  studivz was a fun social network before everyone migrated to facebook to also be able to communicate with the non-german-speakers . 
   oh , and sadly i ca n't promise you that we will have a lot of snow - you 'd have to go further north i do n't think going north would help ( apart from very very north ) but go to the mountains instead - schneeberg ( snow mountain ) via schneebergbahn can be a daytrip . 
  [ this ] ( http://images.cdn.baunetz.de/img/2/0/1/7/0/6/3/03_foto_wohnprojekt_wien-75d6b7b841dbde95.jpeg ) has won a price for `` social architecture '' - [ article in german ] ( http://www.baunetz.de/meldungen/meldungen-hans_sauer_preis_vergeben_4733693.html ), 
  waiters ca n't give individual bills in most countries , if you eat with other people abroad always keep lots of small money in order to pay your part of the bill . 
  yes , it 's normal to me , and i quite enjoy that i still can discover `` new '' old pitoresque corners of my city . 
  i do n't think that i ever grow tired of it though . 
  it 's difficult for me to imagine living in a place without beautiful architecture of different eras but just new stuff . 
  ovs of some films can be seen too , but usually in a smaller cinema halls or a cinema with older projectors - so you can decide if you want to see the movie on a large screen/3d/whatever is the newest shit dubbed or on smaller screen/older technic in ov, 
  so [ hammer & sickle is a poorly soviet thing ?

  hagen-dasz : my small billa `` around the corner '' has had it for years . 
  sch\u00f6ller : it was more common in the independent ( nah & frisch ) stores - they have either eskimo or sch\u00f6ller , never have i seen both . 
  next to eskimo , there is also sch\u00f6ller ( nestle ) , haagen-dasz , some italian brands i do n't remember and the stores own brands available in supermarkets . 
  ben & jerrys is also widely available which i find surprising , because it tasts worse then most other while being more expensive . 
  btw , the recent heat wave lad to a shortage of packaged ice cream , especially cornetto http://derstandard.at/2000061950349/eiscreme-wird-knapp-in-oesterreich, 
  nice house shoes ( birkenstock-like ) during cooler times , nothing when i 'm hot . 
  state flags seen more frequently than the national flags , but they are n't `` alternative flags '' . 
   \u010cesk\u00fd krumlov nice daytrip distance from vienna many other places in austria and germany . 
  the name first meant nothing to me , but googling the [ image ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=sriracha&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjzmmxltmxvahwdllakhaa6dokq_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=947 ) - those bottles are quite common in fast food places , asian - but also d\u00f6ner shops, 
  we have no such shortage . 
  things like being no 1 most livable city according to some polls might do the trick . 
  wages are n't everything . 
  you 've missed [ elfriede blauensteiner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elfriede_blauensteiner ) ( 22 january 1931 -- 18 november 2003 ) , dubbed the `` black widow '' , was an austrian serial killer who murdered at least three victims by poison . 
  in each case , she inherited the victim 's possessions . 
  interesting - here we have the opposite assumption : seeing a man with a large car = thinking he has to compensate something ( has a small dick ), 
  there are still fees on credit cards while paying with a debit card is usually without any fees . 
  you can , but you recommended to `` just use a credit card '' which i read as `` just use the credit card you already have '', 
  exactly the opposite . 
  you will pay 5 % extra to every purchase when paying with a foreing currency credit card . 
  while using my ( euro ) debit card is free of charge everywhere in euro countries . 
  little susi says to the kiddy fiddler : this forest is creepy . 
  he answers : well i have it worse - i 'll have to walk back all alone, 
  two of my grandmas cousins emigrated to the us , but they have lost contact a long time ago . 
  no idea if they are still alive or have any descendants . 
   last words we had it first - 1919 - or about the same time ? 
  the hammer symbolizes workers , the sickle farmers and the citywall-crown burghers , so `` all of society '' . 
  after 1945 the broken chains were added to symbolize regained freedom . 
  why are people so triggered by a hammer and a sickle that are not even crossed ? 
  well , going with our cote of arms , it 's the [ federal eagle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_austria ), 
   t i think it is indeed a national symbol right ? 
  weigh in austria !, 
  yes , our [ federal eagle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/austria_bundesadler.svg/2000px-austria_bundesadler.svg.png ), 
  should that be a joke or how did you come to that conclusion ? 
  short video [ context the media lacks : austrian troops to italian border ] ( https://youtu.be/qif0nukfh9a ), 
  oh yes - i was trying to read all the knickerbockerbanden books but he nearly wrote as fast as i could read . 
  it took 20 + books for me to realize that they all follow the same formula . 
  then i migrated to holbein . 
  can we still call it stereotype when it became flesh and made his dwelling among presidents ? 
  no , benevolent parenting is just considerered `` good parenting '' without any connotations towards other countries . 
  not parenting at all and letting you kids just do what they want is called `` laissez-faire '' - but i do n't think people are thinking of france when they criticize that style . 
  also , beating your kids is still leagal at least in some parts of the us , while its prohibitad for a long time here , so that association does n't make any sense . 
  i suppose the answeres here are less dependent on the country of the person but of their gender . 
  i do n't know but you could call the austrian raiways and ask : http://www.oebb.at/en/leistungen-und-services/kundenservice,
