  worst : whenever i am at the sea , i feel the urge to swimm in it , regardless of the temperature or water quality because from early childhood i associate the sea with summer holiday at a nice beach . 
  thanks to `` murder she wrote '' i picture pitoresque small fishing towns with nice , eldery people and a lot of murders . 
  without it i 'd probably just know of it 's existence and location . 
   best : mild climate , mild winters and summers because of the gulf stream . 
  i would see that as a disadvantage - i very much enjoy our hot summers and cold winters . 
  a lukewarm summer and rainy winter is a horrible prospect to me . 
  indeed , the details do sound a bit different then how the story usually is told . 
  but let me be divils advocat here : 95 % of his crops next year were roundup-ready - but how many % of the seeds he plantet that year were ? 
  how precisely can your neighbour spray his roundup - how much will blow into your field ruining your crops ? 
  so if your neighbours switched to a crop that allows them to use poison that will kill anything it hits - how free is your choice to plant any corp you want ? 
  in europe where field sizes are much smaller , as was the general opinion on [ / pics ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6kpci0/cumulus_nimbus_letting_a_poor_town_near_vienna/?st=j4onwyu0&amp;sh=0a3cb8f1 ) yesterday - if one farmer plants a gmo seed that entitles them to use roundup , all his neighbours will have to follow or go bankrupt , a fast domino effect . 
   the most likely reason that gmos are banned in europe is because it is a from of economic protectionism , not so much that - as commercial non-gmo-seed-producers are n't charities either - it 's more a concern about unforseeable effects an the whole system ( food safety , environment , sustainability etc ) if bringing this huge change it . 
  it 's probably from the lessons learned from biodiesel version 1 . 
  here just a small , easily reversable change was made : setting a quota of < 10 % biodiesel that should be mixed into normal diesel . 
  origianlly the idea was that european farmers are incentivesed to again grow plants on fallow , less profitable agricultural land . 
  they have some auxillary income besides growing food , we import less fuel from instable countries , at least a few % of our fuel is co2-neutral - everybody wins . 
  the real effect however was that it was cheaper to clear rain forests to grow fuel plants for europe in countries where there is n't enough food for the local population , the whole process ment much more co2 for the environement then not having any bio fuel - everybody lost . 
  throwing a huge monkey-wrench with unforseeable outcomes into the agricultural system that is n't reversible did n't become more popular after that . 
  this should be on the top, 
   no one is `` forcing '' anyone to do anything ; there are plenty of seeds that you can buy that you can replant . 
  not really true - farmers who 's non-gmo crop had been contaminated with gmo seeds from neighboring fields were sued by the company - it should be the other way around imo . 
  that 's not the system of agricultur we would like to have here . 
  be sure you buy the vignette before you enter austria , asfinag likes to do checks just a few km after the border and there are hefty fines . 
  the last gas station before the border probably has a big sign announcing that fact . 
  do n't buy a all-year vignette , but the 10-days-v . 
  sorry , i did n't hover over your flag - in the resolution of my screen it looks like the english flag with one white pixle in the middle, 
  i 'd say thats a good example about our different styles of communication in england vs. central europe . 
  your answer would defenitly lead to follow up questions `` what - how can you not have an opinion , are you kidding me ? '', 
  and not be understood as an attempt to avoid the subject . 
  eam , not having an opinion over the-single-major-thing-that-is-viewed-worldwide will not only make you look stupid , it will enrage people much more than if you have a different political leaning than them . 
  saying you traveled to europe to get away from trumpistan for a bit - then you could ask about national politics in the place you are , or change the subject entirely . 
  politics is our favourite topic for small talk , if the weather is n't abnormal that day , so probably yes . 
  also quite common : nemeth = `` german '' in hungarian, 
  quite common , there has been a large increase in the last 5 years . 
  my suspicion however is that for lots of people `` it 's just a phase '', 
  thing is : they have problems hearing the difference between u and \u00fc - something that was totally unthinkable to me until i realized i have difficulty differenciating the different czech sch sounds . 
  but are n't all berufschulen also teaching english ? 
  it 's fachenglisch ( subject-related english ) , so they are more focused on vocabulary of their trade than holding a philosopical discussion , but at least some basic knowledge of english will be provided . 
  that 's not a stereotype , it 's mostely true  my favourite `` game '' when bored in the underground : guess where the tourists are from - recognizing germans is quite easy - americans = old people with shiny new sneakers are also easy to guess . 
  one week to malta ( close to valetta ) , one to cannes for language training . 
  other trips ( skiing weeks , one-day hiking tours , mauthausen for our concentration camp excursions ) did n't take us to cities but small towns or rural areas . 
  no tea for us , we have `` sturm im wasserglas '', 
  that 's a quote from faust though - the devil had taken the shape of the dog . 
  in the city , where lot 's of people do n't live in a house with garden , renting a small piece of field - often with already planted vegetables , sometimes also automated sprinklers became very popular in recent years . 
  as is maping fruit trees on public land that everybody is free to harvest : https://mundraub.org/map, 
  ( vienna ) when i have visitors i ask them for their favourite architectural periode to then point them to things to see - we have much to much interesting stuff for tourists to check out in one go . 
  but generally i like to show them griechengasse - just a few steps apart there are the oldest residental buidings ( gothic , i think 13hundreds ) , a peace of the former city wall with cannon balls from the ottoman siege still sticking in it and a life-sized puppet of a legend figur form the times of the black death ( augustin ) . 
  and the ones singing in colloquial german are n't even known in germany, 
  depends on the aliens i guess - how frightening are they ? 
  interesting - and this is why we should learn history from different perspectives . 
  from the little i have read , it looks like the bloke skiing style was mostly cross-country skiing with some methode to manage to go downhill if neccessary , while the lilienfeld style did some inventions to skis and skiing style particularly for going downhill . 
  thanks for the info, 
  well , hitler invented that trying to undermine the churches, 
  industral [ salt-mining ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hallstatt_culture ) or classical music, 
  who are you refering to ? 
  [ according to us an austrian invented alpine skiing ? 
  ] ( http://www.schneestation.com/phpwcms/index.php?historie ), 
  most quotable ? 
  definetely muttertag i sag 's glei , i wars ned - i hab mi den aufn willi gsetzt !, 
   americans are not blunt and keep honesty to a minimum to save from hurting feelings . 
  that 's exactly what we percieve as superficial friendlyness - you are friendly to my face , but i have no idea what you really are thinking . 
   it 's only americans who are like this , i think . 
  i think the british have a simmilar communication style . 
  groschen - interesting , til as groschen was our small unit schilling/100 , i would have misunderstood that . 
  do n't mix up criticism with hate . 
  we do n't beat around the bush with our political opinions - if we think something is a bad idea we say it to your face/write it plainly . 
  if we critizice you/your government it 's a friendly `` change my view '' - request . 
  my experience with americans is that they tend to not say what they think but uphold a superficial `` friendliness '' as long as possible and only show their true opinion once they boil over with anger . 
  from that perspective i understand that honesty might seem shocking . 
  the decoration is uniform but there might be different cake types in the different stories . 
  sometimes the cakes are not on top of each other but [ seperated on a stand so that the lower cakes can be served before the upper one have been eaten up ] ( http://www.konditorei-haferl.at/tl_files/torten/hochzeitstorten / 000005 . jpg ) in some regions lots of different kinds of [ decorated cookies ] ( http://static.chefkoch-cdn.de/ck.de/fotoalben/6ab3fbcd55d207368ab29bf2013f97c4/48904/medium_florentiner035.jpg ) are an absolute must, 
  vienna : [ alte donau ] ( http://www.angelkarten.at/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/alte-donau.jpg ) and [ donauinsel ] ( https://www.likealocalguide.com/media/cache/ec/65/ec6545983f2529a590a4429c777e683d.jpg ), 
  i do n't like sweet dishes as the main dish , like kaiserschmarren , marillenkn\u00f6del , mohnnudeln etc. 
  - the taste is n't the issue , but i just prefer savoury . 
  [ relevant : cabaret song about english language suffering by it 's global sucess ] ( https://youtu.be/bllm6zk7rnc?t=24s ), 
  this, 
  it 's a heated discussion where the best ice cream store in vienna is , let alone all over europe . 
  but all the good stores that opened longer then 5 years ago are italian or pretend to be , so italy would have the best reputation for ice cream . 
  any idea why it got better ? 
  i think the general trend is that manners like that decline , especially in big cities . 
  talking about inglorious basterds : yes , but at least they are self-aware about that and are upfront about not being historically correct . 
  other movies are unironically dripping with american patriotism and inacurrencies ( looking at you pearl habour ) to an amout that they are unwatchable . 
  i ca n't say anything about band of brothers because i have n't watched it . 
  other examples of `` national '' writers we read that are probably very common would be \u00d6don von horvath ( geschichten aus dem wienerwald ) , arthur schnitzler ( anatol , reigen ), 
  we too . 
  - in german class, 
   we did a 9 city european trip and paris by far had the most tourists groups from asia . 
  so you were n't in vienna, 
  i 'd say that has more to do with the special segment of russians we get as tourists ( new-rich oligarch families ) then what an average `` russian '' is like . 
   people do n't wear traditional clothes and listen to `` polka-ish '' music in 99 % of austria . 
  a lot of pubs catering to tourists anywhere in austria have their waiting stuff wear traditional-ish clothes . 
  and the afterski-noise ( ca n't call it music ) could also be classified as `` polka '' by someone lucky enough to not know it . 
  yes , we have subsidised music schools , but i do n't know about the percentages , and i think not the national state , but the federal states or even the munpcipalities are giving the money . 
  it 's sometimes glowing in the morning - from the platform of u1 kaserm\u00fchlen it 's quite a beautiful sight , seeing the city center and the glowing mountain in the background, 
  then there are those classics , which try to use as many words in the foreign language as possible and still be understandable . 
  [ heisse n\u00e4chte in palermo ] ( https://youtu.be/l2qgoxybdmw ) [ strada del sole ] ( https://youtu.be/3ochun1i8ze ) to stay in the time slot of your first example : this song claims there is no beer in hawaii [ es gibt kein bier auf hawaii ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsuhgb9ap-c ), 
  depends on your definition - the east end of the alps ends shortly before vienna . 
  on a clear day i can see the schneeberg ( snow mountain ) while waiting for the underground ( at an above the ground station ) . 
  a bit like in [ this photo - though the lense used here makes the mountain seem closer ] ( http://www.botanische-spaziergaenge.at/bilder/lumix_30/p1000241.jpg ),
