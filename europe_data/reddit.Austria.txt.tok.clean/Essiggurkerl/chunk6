  interesting - is it more the brasilian or the middleeuropean version ? 
  and the `` bread '' is sloppy and sweetish, 
  i doubt they are paying taxes on their rose-selling `` businesses '' so it 's at least illegal in that aspect . 
   civic nationalism ( not ethnic ) rather than being a melting pot of cultures which is something only the us can/wants to do in my opinion we are more a `` melting pot '' then the us is . 
  in austria we have adopted a lot of the cultural things of our former crown lands - foods/cooking recipes is probably are probably the most visible one . 
  gulasch from hungary , lots of sweet dishes from bohamia , even the wiener schnitzel is thought to be influenced from milan . 
  most of the austrian words that differ from germany-german , and are an important aspect of our national identity originate in languages of the former austrian empire ( palatschinke , krapfen , karotte , ... ) . 
  the process did n't stop back then , nowadays d\u00f6ner is a beloved fast food , and i am looking forward to some of the syrian dishes i could already try out becoming more common . 
  we expect of our immigrants that they will bring the best parts of their culture over so that the general society can adopt them . 
  reversely we expect of them to try out all the `` austrian things '' and quickly adopt the parts they like ( as well as the self-evident values like equality between the sexes ) . 
  i have the impression that the us leans more towards having different cultures living next to each other , everybody in their own bubble . 
  the recent outbrake of `` cultural appropriation '' even frowns upon mixing and tries to separate people into their `` racial ghettos '' . 
  what is replacing it ? 
   asking one more time after you said you have a bf is a bit assholey its very assholey to have to claim that you are already `` owned '' by a man in order to be left alone . 
   how do you pronounce `` przepraszam '' ? 
  they should have imported carneval instead , the proper dress-up-as-anything-fest . 
  halloween ruined weltspartag, 
  already my parents in the late 1960ties made school trips to mauthausen . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  and kind-of-fitting here : every beginning of the school year parents signed a paper allowing teachers to give kj-tablets to us in case of a nuclear catastrophy . 
  yes , you need to listen - or read the title, 
  in case that 's a serious question : [ this is what it means ] ( https://youtu.be/a23945btjyw ), 
  there were several `` english gardens '' - travel/documentary shows running on different german-laguage channels . 
  they inspired relatives of mine to choose south england for their summer holidays . 
  warsaw pact , cold war , velvet revolution etc were all coverd - if former crown lands count . 
  we had one once - now it 's called world war 1 - would n't recommend, 
  it annoyed me a lot when we were n't part of the eu yet , so i try to pay attention and fight it also now . 
  one short example that particullarly annoyed me : the belian theme park `` mini-europe '' featured only models of buildings of the first 15 eu countries , but still used the name `` europe '', 
  there was a lot going on in our media in 2014 memorating the start of ww1 , i have n't heared anything about plans for celebrating the end . 
   also their belief that they can just take a 20 minutes hike ** in slippers ** and see the greatest alpine panorama ever . 
  btw i learend about `` sound of music '' from dutch tourists while on holiday in salzkammergut . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosna_ ( sausage ) more information on the german site , that you can google-translate, 
  why not ? 
  and then there is the one student too cool/too anarchist for nice clothes , who wears a t-shirt and shorts that look like they should have been washed a month ago . 
  same here, 
  a 3-countries-hicking trip , then a few days recovering at the adriatic sea . 
  herbal teas , but i do n't like the taste of black - , green - , white tea or anything that is made from the `` tea plant '', 
  during our presidential election fp\u00d6 who previously tried to gather anti-eu-voters suddenly claimed they were pro-eu all along . 
  facebook for the `` middleaged '' that were young when facebook was new , whatsapp for the old people , and i 'm not totally sure if facebook or snapchat/other for teens . 
  twitter is rather unpopular in austra , journalists probably use it the most . 
  for us , north starts at the wei\u00dfwurscht\u00e4quator, 
  i do n't think we have that . 
  another story that came to mind regarding typical neighbour relationships is `` the hammer story '' : a man wants to hang a painting . 
  he has the nail , but not the hammer . 
  therefore it occurs to him to go over to the neighbor and ask him to lend him his hammer . 
  but at this point , doubt sets in . 
  what if he does n't want to lend me the hammer ? 
  yesterday he barely spoke to me . 
  maybe he was in a hurry . 
  or , perhaps , he holds something against me . 
  but why ? 
  i did n't do anything to him . 
  if he would ask me to lend him something , i would , at once . 
  how can he refuse to lend me his hammer ? 
  people like him make other people 's life miserable . 
  worst , he thinks that i need him because he has a hammer . 
  this has got to stop !, 
  and suddenly the guy runs to the neighbor 's door , rings , and before letting him say anything , he screams : `` you can keep your hammer , you bastard ! '' from `` the situation is hopeless , but not serious '' ( the pursuit of unhappiness ) , by paul watzlawick, 
  do n't give them ideas \u00d6, 
  hollywood movie ? 
  please do n't - hollywood tends to value tropes over accurancy . 
  no , i do n't like the taste of deep fried stuff . 
  there are a few austrians who have one at home , but it 's the exception . 
   nowadays , they are trying to profit from the migrant crisis . 
  as people smuggles ? 
  just 86 % on the us - but i should be asleep right now, 
  i did n't pay any attention to that because they do n't fit at all to our style of university . 
  one example : if you finish the final exam at highschool positivly in austria , you can just sign up to any austrian university - you can also sign up to several at once , and later decide where you want to stay . 
  this of course shifts student-to-teacher ratios because there are multiples of only nominal students . 
  all of them, 
  learning in the morning that there was a light earthquake during the night that some people on the other side of the city reported to feel - they might be hypochondrians though . 
  and twice a year there is a test of all those signals 15min apart, 
  depending on your political leaning derstandard.at or diepresse.com ( resprectly their print verions ) . 
  [ memrise ] ( https://www.memrise.com/home/ ) hosts user-created courses - for anything that can be learned by hard : vocabulary , geographic knowledge etc. 
  cagalogue sizes vary a lot between languages , and the quality of a course is depended on the user who created them - some are excelent . 
  your democrats would fit in with our conservative party + neos for the more progressive ones , your republicans are more extrem right then our fp\u00d6 . 
  state cote of arms are quite present in austria because they are used at [ licence plates ] ( https://www.google.at/imgres?imgurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ub-feuerwehr.com%2fresources%2fa%2b-%2b%24c3%249cbersicht%2b1.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.ub-feuerwehr.com%2f11.html&amp;docid=jup3nzcngpthgm&amp;tbnid=bsizt_mbgxllbm%3a&amp;vet=10ahukewjeqtzrp6xuahvmelakhbp0al8qmwgnkaywbg..i&amp;w=508&amp;h=465&amp;client=firefox-b-ab&amp;bih=946&amp;biw=1040&amp;q=autokennzeichen%20bundesl%c3%a4nder%20%c3%b6sterreich&amp;ved=0ahukewjeqtzrp6xuahvmelakhbp0al8qmwgnkaywbg&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8#h=465&amp;imgdii=bsizt_mbgxllbm:&amp;vet=10ahukewjeqtzrp6xuahvmelakhbp0al8qmwgnkaywbg..i&amp;w=508 ) - you might not be able to recognice the district ( first letter ) the car is from , but recognicing the federal state is easy . 
  my district ? 
  no , that 's not how our democracy works, 
  here filipinos , especially women , stereotypically work as nurses . 
  afaik they are well liked . 
  still too many vowels, 
  they guessed i am australian - maybe we should stop with the `` no k\u00e4ngurus in austria '' - signs . 
  also , why do they have `` german '' and `` swiss german '' in their list as native languages , but not `` austrian german '' ? 
  top 3 guesses for english dialects : australian , south african , new zealand top 3 guesses for native language : english , dutch , german, 
  same . 
  it resulted with east coast for me , but i had a lot of `` other '' anwers - and do n't have strong feelings for a lot of the offered answers, 
  mostly english , but in vienna we also have secondary schools ( from grade 5 ) that teach french or russian as the main foreign language . 
  maybe also volleyball, 
  what i find particularly abhorrent is that they often have flags in churches . 
  - having this symbol of war decorating churches and at the same time talking about having `` separation between state and religion '' rather brings association of crusades . 
  eu = / = unite with germany we had to wait with joining the eu until the end of the soviet union because they only agreed to the austrian state treaty ( a free austria after 10 years of occupation ) under the condition that we are non-commital . 
  not being allowed to join germany was an important point after wwi , i have no idea if it still stands , but as there is no interest to do so , it does n't really matter . 
  [ same ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=67.7&amp;d=77.1&amp;g=69.6&amp;s=66.4 ), 
  i think we have lost enough , thank you - oh you ment it the other way around ? 
  meh , thanks to schengen and `` freedom of establishment '' it feels like owning everything - and even more - anyway . 
  they do show eurobowl games sometimes on orf sport plus - i have stumbeld upon them - thankfully always summaries of the most interesting bits, 
  do n't you think such actions would incite an `` us versus the rest of the world '' feelings in a lot of us-citizens , stifling the opposition in your country ? 
  agreed - at this point i am just happy he did n't say some stupid shit that starten ww3 tbh, 
  americans often mix up ei and ie - two vastly different sounds,
