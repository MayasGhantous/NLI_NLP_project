  stereotypical breakfest food would be [ kaisersemmeln ] ( https://www.gutekueche.at/img/rezept/8254/kaisersemmel.jpg ) - but you need to buy them fresh - i find black bread as teasty and more convenient , have it with a soft boiled egg , cold cuts , cheese , jam and honey . 
  and a nice coffee . 
  stereotypial sunday lunch is pork roast or schnitzel , both with potato salad and/or rice and other salads ( or kn\u00f6del to the schweinsbraten ) . 
  care to write out obscure accronyms ? 
  the beach can be reached by local train in 30min ( ostia ) - perfect for a day or even half day trip . 
  i 'd also recommend visiting ostia antica, 
  lower austria, 
  i disagree - some secondary schools offer czech as second foreign language ( well , i know at least about one school ) and may i present ( crap , i have no idea how to spell czech - phonetic spelling following ) : ahoi , jak ze masch ? 
  totally agree, 
  our hallways would be blocked if we put washing maschine there . 
  bathroom there 's also a big communal washer and dryer in the attic - but i only use that for extra large things ( duvet ) or things that benefit from a dryer ( again duvet , sleeping bag ), 
   equally , what american foods could you get but do n't like ? 
  mostly just journalists and politicians wanting to have the ~ ~ longest ~ ~ most followers, 
  die siedler von catan and probably most games awarded with [ game of the year ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spiel_des_jahres ), 
  crisp [ frankfurter ] ( https://www.bmlfuw.gv.at/.imaging/mte/bmlfuw/contentimageinlinedouble/dam/bmlfuw/land/lebensmittel/trad-lebensmittel/fleisch/fleischprodukte/frankfurter/frankfurter---mit-semmel---ama/jcr:content/frankfurter%20-%20mit%20semmel%20-%20ama.png ) -  [ `` american style hot dogs '' ] ( http://c8.alamy.com/comp/b7h4f6/jar-of-hot-dog-sausages-b7h4f6.jpg ) for question two : peanut butter, 
  yes , same in austria . 
  exception is if you are a big group ( 10 up ) . 
  and if you have suspicion that the restaurant you are in wo n't handle bringing the entire tables food close together the people still waiting will the those who have their food to start eating . 
  they block the left side of the escalator - especially annoying if i want to run to catch the tube . 
  i have n't noticed special countries who are the worst offenders here - it 's more of a village people/city people thing . 
  tarokkieren is quite popular in austria too - but more for the `` advanced '' players , the rules are much more difficult then schnapsen . 
  i do n't know the rules , but i definetly want to learn some time . 
  i only know of the 4-person game and one interesting aspect is that pairs play together , but who plays whith whom is n't known from the start but depends on what cards you have - so one person will know who their partner is , but the other does n't . 
  the person who knows will try to support their partner , but not be too obvious so that the other 2 do n't notice . 
  this most complex of card games ( i know of ) is more of a game for regular groups compared to schnapsen which will be played casually by eveyone from grandparent to grandchild . 
  in the [ movie series `` der bockerer '' the game ( and the circle of players ) is a recurring theme ] ( https://youtu.be/icsqaffljy4?list=pl84bd42941dc90865 ), 
  up and coming - the last 10 years saw some communal marketing efforts with the [ dac regions ] ( http://www.oesterreichwein.at/unser-wein/dac-districtus-austriae-controllatus/ ) - but it 's very concentrated in the east - the west of the country is indeed beer , most and schnaps country . 
  i would have said wine - gr\u00fcner veltliner , zweigelt , riesling , blaufr\u00e4nkischer are some dac types . 
  how does it work ? 
  `` amendment '' can translate to correction/revision as well as addition/extension . 
  - do you add onto it with ever correction -  eventually leading to a mess nobody can see through or are the laws actually changed ? 
  in our system a 2/3 majority of parliament can create laws with constitutional status as well as change old ones . 
  sorry , no time to read through that , but an important start would be to ** stop venerating that document ** as if it was a holy book that descendet form heaven - only then you can start modernizing it . 
  today is double april 1st after all, 
  kind of boring and the [ video looks like a cheaply made tourism ad ] ( https://youtu.be/sppm1v3dqze ) - but it works well on the radio , i assume that 's what they went for this year . 
  the only ancient connection that comes to mind is with vienna : [ in the middleages scottish monks ( english wikipedia says irish ) were invited to found a monastery in vienna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schottenstift ) when it became the capital city . 
  up to this day the name remained ( schottenstift ) , also the name of a school with a good reputation ( schottengymnasium ) , several street names ( schottenring , schottentor - also underground stops , schottenbastei , schottengasse , etc. ), 
  not op , but i 'd say it 's a bad habit - only acceptable if you serve it with pommes frittes , which is a disgrace of itself . 
  i 'd suggest some small improvements in the guidlines : * `` what 's your opinion of [ thing most people have never heared of ] '' should always include a short 1-2 sentences definition of the thing , possibly a link . 
  * always use modern units * very lazy tourism questions ( please plan my trip through all over europe without me giving any special interests , special needs or any other reason why i do n't just do my homework and google the stuff ) should be discouraged . 
  seems about right . 
  and prohibition and how it enabled the mafia . 
  i appreciate all those countries who have a different design for every coin . 
  boring coins is the mayor argument agains a monarchy . 
  germans usually do n't understand the word palatschinke . 
  there are those stories about german tourists interpreting it as palat-schinken ( something-bacon ) , ordering it and then complain when they get pancakes . 
  no those were emmigrants in the 19th century . 
  had to google it but in fact there was a lot going on . 
  [ a mass in st stephens cathedral , also an exibition in wien museum ] ( http://www.salzburg.com/nachrichten/oesterreich/politik/sn/artikel/gedenkmesse-im-stephansdom-am-internationalen-roma-tag-144817/ ) [ presentation of a `` roma strategy '' by state secretary and national roma-contact-bureau ] ( http://www.kosmo.at/delem-delem-internationaler-tag-der-roma-und-sinti-video/ ) [ lots of things going on in burgenland ] ( http://www.erinnern.at/bundeslaender/oesterreich/gedenktage/8.-april-internationaler-roma-gedenktag ) - the state where most [ roma live ] ( http://volksgruppen.orf.at/roma/stories/2833420/ ), 
  this sequence might be : look at what the canteen has to offer - if it does n't sound good discuss if several people are interested in ordering something , go to a restaurant nearby or do a supermarked run . 
  nothing if iban and bic is used, 
  i agree that that is quite possible - but using gas now gains him nothing . 
  that plan sounds very well - for an immigration program . 
  do n't get me wrong - `` guest workers '' of the 70ties and 80ties and refugees from the 90ties and 2000sends turn out to actually be immigrants and not just `` here for a little while and as soon as possible go back to the country of origin '' . 
  - and failing to start proper immigration programms right away is something we still have to catch on . 
  but there might be syrian refuggees who are not interested in becoming europeans - who would rather chill out in savety and some comfort until the war is over and go back to their country as soon as possible . 
  at the same time : why sould you only qualify for an european immigration program if your country is wartorn ? 
  very suspicious about the claim that it was assad - what would he gain from using serin right now - now that finally the us warms up to the idea of not regime-changing him at all costs ? 
  now that he is winning militarily anyways . 
  the question that could lead a way is who gains from it ? 
  first suspect would be american non-state compatant companies that make a lot of money form a long lasting war . 
  i 'd appreciate to gain proof first and fire later - but unfortunately thats not the american way . 
  why not tell us what you are talking about first ? 
  oh , there is an edit - so horse racing is still a thing ? 
  what about an epic closing : [ der rosarote panther ] ( https://youtu.be/jrl5z1k60tg ), 
  i 'd appreciate it, 
  is n't `` fungi '' just italian for `` pilze/schwammerl '' ? 
   in 2003 , the phrase on everybody 's lips was `` pre-emptive strike . '', 
  yes - because everybody was criticizing it !, 
  brings back memories about how germany `` defended '' itself against poland in 1939 . 
  different orthodox denominations have grown significantly in recent years due to yugoslavia war refugees and other innereuropean immigrants . 
  podcast of news program of public radio station - what category is this ? 
  the podcast that discussed this video from the 80ties was published last week - i 'd guess some of the listeners being amused by this `` english for non-english speakers '' song were amused by it and posted it on facebook , reddits and whereever - and you stumbled upon one of those secondary posts . 
  ah ok - maybe the person who made it appear `` somewhere on the internet '' for you then is :-) the timing would fit anyway, 
  is it illegal now ? 
  but most people wo n't like the taste of it . 
  hello fellow [ hi ] ( http://www.hellointernet.fm/ ) listener - no , before episode 80 i had n't heared of it . 
  burgenland croatian is a real insular language - far removed from `` real '' croatian or even slovene . 
  what about carintian slovene - which borders directly to slovenia ? 
  ... moaning about how everything was much cheaper `` unterm schilling '' not considering inflation would have gone on for 15 years regardless . 
  what ? 
  have you really heard anybody saying that ? 
  ( unironically , not making fun of the right crowd by hyperbolism ? ), 
  i think one explatation is if the public pictures themselves as a possible victim . 
  - lots of people all over europe have been to london or paris once , viewer to st. petersburg . 
  so there is less of an emotional `` this could be me in that underground train '' reaction . 
  as soon as politics were made there , people would percieve linz as unfriendly mordor , regardless how the people really are ( just like vienna now ) . 
  i agree with your other points , linz would make most sense . 
  also lots of modern buildings there , not as much pressure to keep everything looking `` historic '' for the tourists like f.ex . 
  same in austria - half a liter is called `` ein kr\u00fcgerl '' , 0,3 l is `` ein seiterl '' . 
  so , nobody in poland believes in `` earth was created in 7 days '' - that 's what i thought . 
  popular here too - as well as b\u00e4rlauchzeit ( bear 's garlic - right now ) , schwammerlzeit ( mushroom time ) wildsaison ( game season ) etc. 
  what - american style protestantism is pupular in poland ? 
  sachertorte , apfelstrudel , milchrahmstrudel , topfenkuchen , linzertorte , salzburger nockerl , and the list goes on and on, 
  hm , i have seen [ hungarian-style baumkuchen ] ( http://eatsmarter.de/rezepte/baumkuchen-auf-ungarische-art ) in austria too , did n't even know the thing you link to existed . 
  but still would agree that this baumkuchen is more typical for hungary and is just also a thing here due to being neighbours ( just like langos ) . 
  i have the suspicion that the true reason is to have it as spaced out to 1 . 
  may celebrations as possible to air out the flags biannually . 
  the `` official '' reason i do n't know about . 
  yes , i have done that once - renting a bigger boat in sibenik for a few days and heading to the kornati .
