  it was definitly an interesting experience . 
  but i personally only hold a `` drivers licens '' for inland waters and due to becoming seasick easily when calculating routs below deck it will probably stay that way . 
  yes i sail as recreation when on a lake - whatever the rent place has to offer . 
  segelschule neusiedl am see has catamarans for example .

  then vote every week who will go to france ? 
  according to toni knittel , your fellow tyrolian `` ungef\u00e4hr bei salzburg '' - so best ask your salzburgian colleagues both and record where exactly in salzburg they are from . 
  noted  now i am interested where the feber/februar border lies and if it 's the same place like the arrrrsch/oasch border . 
  the seven ravens - a gebr\u00fcder grimm story, 
  oh , til - where are you from ? 
  climate change, 
  i suppose you wanted to write `` j\u00e4nner '' ; `` febers is very oldfashiones - you might see that in some old poam but not in contemporary writing, 
   reality tv and talk shows interesting - while we import a lot of scripted tv shows ( which are all dubbed thanks to our big neighbour ) i do n't think any of those american reality tv or talk shows were ever shown on tv . 
  i suspect the reason is that it is cheaper to make your own bad reality tv/talk shows than to dub foreign ones . 
  [ hasta la vista , baby ] ( https://youtu.be/q73guur8zlw ), 
  we have the stereotypes that it is the germans who were white socks in sandals - next time i have to listen to these socksandal peoples and count the nationalities . 
  i think it 's more a question of density : do you live in a vast country with few people you are used to traveling far distances to get to anything . 
  my absolute favourite author : [ mira lobe - eng .

  wikipedia ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/das_kleine_ich-bin-ich ) - [ audioversion ] ( https://youtu.be/ozsk73p9tbs ), 
  a cooked meal . 
  lunch is the most important meal of the day . 
  companies often offer affordable canteens to their employees , universities have several `` mensas '' offering cooked meals for a small price . 
  probably not unique to our country : while the bells are on holiday before easter , children replace them with their wooden noise-makers : [ hand-held ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hihguebkqh4 ) or [ a big one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nexzzlgcacs ), 
  hm , do n't count on that . 
  i have witnessed several cases where the waiter brought mineral water ( sparkling of course ) when you just order `` water '' . 
  `` russischer tee '' is how old people call black tea looking the reason up just now : originally refered to tea from china transported through russia because non-sea-transport gives better quality . 
  somehow all black tea ended up being called `` russian tea '' in colloquial language . 
  somehow reduce the money that can be put into a presidental campaign - the way it is now every candidate who wants to win pretty much has to sell himself to shady corporations to fund their campaign . 
  be prepared for some cultural differences that you might misinterpret as unfriendlyness towards you . 
  talking politics is our form of small talk - so as soon as somebody chatting with you finds out you are american they will ask you about your opinion of your president . 
  prejudices about black americans ? 
  if you happen to run into a fan of basketball or some `` black '' music styles they might expect you to be the resident expert in their favourite topic . 
  also look up our restaurant etiquette which is very different , and be aware that `` looking at people '' is n't frowned upon here - [ people from english speaking countries might call that `` staring '' , ] ( https://youtu.be/e-irquhcive?t=3m3s ) it happens to everybody regardless of skin colour . 
  you do n't have to sign up to be allowed to vote but contrary get sent an invitation/reminder + potential form to order an absentee ballot automatically . 
  also elections are held on a sunday so that most people have the day off -  voter supression is n't a thing here . 
  true . 
  some american studio bought the rights to remake braunschlag , but i ca n't see that dark humour work on an american audience . 
   because the question has probably been asked before . 
  that 's in fact a true concern - first use the search function there for similar questions and read all the answers there . 
  only then ask your ** more specific ** question - add for example your special interests , your age etc. 
  i 'd say germany . 
  despite our constant struggle to prove how different we are to them , they are still our closest neighbour . 
  and politically they have their shit together . 
  [ margarete sch\u00fctte-lihotzky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/margarete_sch%c3%bctte-lihotzky ) - inventor of the `` frankfurt kitchen '' - the first sensibly designed kitchen and other furniture for comfortable living in small spaces . 
  she took a scientific approach by measuring the distances people walked in their kitchen when preparing a meal and designed for the minimal affort . 
  allegedly wearing shoes is what causes that . 
   shoes on inside anyone else 's house why ? 
  did it ? 
  biggest plus is that they display the true delivery cost right from the start - which is deliberatly hidden on amazon before the final order-window . 
  op , why do n't you link pictures to the food items you are asking about , as you are already aware that there are different things called the same word ? 
  did n't know that was the case for germany - but i have been to paris a few month ago . 
  seeing `` bands '' of `` soldiers '' patrolling the streets - always in packs of 2-6 guys was a very strange sight . 
  it looked like the city was under siege . 
  i am aware that especially paris had some gruesome terrorist attacks to stomach , but am not sure this is the right reaction to it . 
  - giving the population the feeling to be constantly surrounded by `` army dudes '' kind of makes the terrorists win . 
  the knoff-hoff-show, 
  i know too little about the previous law to have an oppinion on most - only the last point : unified way of marking of firearms and centralised database system that sounds very sensible to me , at least for the schengen area . 
  as we do n't have border controls and it is very easy to drive your gun to another country , it 's only sensible to have a common database and marking standards . 
  wanted to post the same thing about hungarian , czech , polish names that hav been `` austrianised '' a long time ago, 
  `` in your house '' - yes - in the community laundry at the attic of my house . 
  i use that only for things that should be dried in a drieer : sleeping bag , duvet etc. 
  are `` shaken up '' and isolate better if dried in such a drier . 
  my usual laundry i wash with the washing maschine in my flat and hang on a rack - energy efficient and saves ironing . 
  i worked near a restaurant that served it - we often went there for lunch . 
  but before that i had never heard of it . 
  nudelsuppe is a well loved starter and as [ old-viennese-suppentopf ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/alt-wiener_suppentopf ) containing meat it can also be eaten as the main dish , so the concept is n't entirely foreign to us . 
  ( no english version of the wikipedia article yet ) . 
  czech flag becaus they brake out of the `` 3 parallel stripes '' monotony . 
  mazedonia and bosnia + herzegovina for the same reason too . 
  there is a whole [ `` norwegian quater '' ] ( https://www.google.at/maps/place/trondheimgasse,+1220+wien/@48.215878,16.4740383,17.5z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x476d011e0e63e087:0xb4ce62d32e1ce2db!8m2!3d48.2161434!4d16.4761507 ) with streets called after norwegian cities . 
  pragerstra\u00dfe and br\u00fcnnerstra\u00dfe are the names of the streets in vienna that lead to the respective cities in czech republic . 
  let 's invite at least slovenia for a little bit of mediteranian coast line . 
  better croatia too . 
  this should be top, 
  nobody is forced to gain an austrian citizeship . 
  but if you become a citizen , you should accept the laws of your country . 
  they can of course regain austrian citicenship - by at the same time ending whatever other citizenship they had in the meantime . 
  gaining citizenship is n't the point , holding 2 citicenships is what is forbidden . 
  there is a bit of a difference between `` not cooperating '' and deliberatly setting up a system to deceive . 
  if you think a bit about it , i 'm sure you can find it too . 
  dual citizenship is n't allowed in austria . 
  people who take the austrian citizenship have to end their former one . 
  exception is if you are born in a country that hands out citizenships by being born there , but also are an austrian citizen : then you can keep both citizenships until your 18th bistday and decide then which one you want to keep . 
  the state of turkey is systematically cheating on that law by allowing turkish citizens who want to take the austrian citizenship to hand in their turkish citizenship only temporary when taking the austrian c. and then giving back the t. c. secretly in order to have masses of voting austro-turks . 
  this is of course unfair towards all other people who keep our laws . 
  i am not sure what the best way is to deal with that . 
  austria has been an asking turky for years for lists of their citizens who are living here so that our laws can be enforced but they refuse to do so . 
  i 'd say yes - an english-natives accent when speaking german will be different if they are from england or the us . 
  - but only german-natives which are quite at home in the english language will hear that difference - people who after school stopped using english and watch dubbed tv instead of pirating the origial versions from the internet wo n't . 
  that 's exactly the same here . 
  do you need a specific job for your school ( ferialpraktikum ) or would any job be ok ? 
  in any case - at http://bestinfo.at/pages/index.php?lng=de&amp;m=0 i am sure there were some booths for that topic specifically . 
  have a look at the `` aussteller '' . 
  true - we produce a surplus of milk and butter , so it has been a staple for generations while peanut butter is sold in the exotic foods section . 
  hm peanut butter - not popular at all hear . 
  the people who have tried it , generally hated it , me included . 
  serious anwer : no , putting mustard on the bread would have never come to my mind without reading about it . 
  the reason we spread butter and you do n't is probably that our bread rolls and bread is solid enough to actually [ spread butter onto without it falling apart ] ( http://media.news.de/images/fehlt-in-kaum-einer-lunchbox-das-gute-alte-butterbrot_855547757_800x600_2919643c041272e5a554b0b6e9ebc14b.jpg?images/c7/b5/d01e8f983e63c870c8177e2e912e.jpg,nopic/no_pic.jpg,800,600,,1,67,0,889,667 , , ) . 
  for savory cream cheese or different spread are also an option , but what would you put between bread and jam/honey/nutella , if not butter ?
