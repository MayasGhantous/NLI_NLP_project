nah ... you do n't . 
  you do n't even understand what roman empire was . 
  damn ... it 's been 9 days and i still ca n't believe someone from europe is so uneducated . 
  it 's not common . 
  everyone needed to prove his `` greekness '' . 
  dude ... terrorist attacks are not a real threat for someone . 
  you have literally way more chances to die from a blowjob than a terrorist attack . 
  it was philip ii of macedon . 
  the difference is that macedonians were greeks like spartans and athenians . 
  slavs came into balkans literally one thousand years after the fall of macedonian empire . 
  macedonians were taking part at the olympics . 
  that means that they were considered to be greek . 
  they were speaking greek etc and the empire was created by the house of `` argeads '' which was greek . 
  demosthenes called them `` barbarians '' not because they were not greek but because they were acting like them . 
  consubstantiation is the word . 
  after a bit of googling it 's the same as '' \u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 '' and the literal translation is `` same substance '' . 
  it means `` same form '' i believe . 
  shit you are right ... i went straight to the articles . 
  i can read greek too and it does n't . 
  all it says at page 19 is that christianism is the `` predominant religion '' . 
  why you cant ? 
  they do n't shoot greeks . 
  i was there not so long ago . 
  the only difference is that you ca n't find alchohol like you could 2-3 years ago and that taxim 's shops are closing pretty fast . 
  it doesnt . 
  nah ... he was slav and his name was alexandrewko the gretko . 
  yes . 
  because that massive task needs to get paid . 
   the euro is fine . 
  eh ... no it is n't . 
  edit : i do n't believe i am getting downvoted for stating the obvious ... that the euro has many-many flaws . 
  he is getting paid to do all that you fucking dumbass . 
  like his other graffiti .

  they must be more than 2.000 . 
  i think there are 2.500 only in istambul . 
  dont u see dude ? 
  so much vandalism . 
  https://www.instagram.com/wd_wilddrawing/ he is probably getting paid to do most of these . 
  thx you for the post . 
  very informative . 
  how can a fighter cost much more than what it was advirtised ? 
  were n't the deals made before the delivery ? 
  did countries know how much it will cost but said `` ok '' to the new nearly doubled price ? 
  as for greece , i do n't believe that they will buy f-35 either but that 's what i [ read ] ( http://en.protothema.gr/greece-to-get-f-35-stealth-jets-photos-video/ ) here . 
  i ve heard that they have many problems that wo n't be solved anytime soon tho and that they lose vs any fighter once they get spotted . 
  i assume both are not true ? 
  greece , belgium and every other country are looking to buy f-35 . 
  can someone that is familiar with military stuff tell me why everyone wants to buy this expensive fighter ? 
  is it so strong ? 
  is n't russian fighters for example way cheaper ? 
  sorry to break it for you but you were and will always be at the brink of grexit as long as your debt is unsustainable . 
  maybe varoufakis was a narcissist but in my opinion he wasnt wrong . 
  noone said that it was not greece 's fault . 
  but instead of helping them we fucked them over and in the meantime we guaranteed that we will lose our money . 
  our politicians forced a country with an unsustainable debt to take the biggest loan in human history and instead of being angry at them , you are being mad because a country that faces worse economical crisis than us did in the 30 's can not recover . 
  so nice and european of you . 
  i applaud the rape of reasoning that is happening in your brain right now . 
  is this a meme ? 
  can people without any knowledge about the situation stop having that strong opinions ? 
  greece did n't want to borrow that much money back in 2010 . 
  it was forced to do it . 
  moreover , everyone faked the numbers . 
  spanish banks were accused of doing it again back in 2009 . 
  even germany could not reach the eu limits . 
  you just hear about greece because otherwise you would n't be ok with what happens there . 
  you hear about tax evasion in greece but never for estonia that has higher numbers . 
  if i remember correctly imf apologized and admitted that they were wrong multiple times but somehow you keep repeating your brainwashed misinformed opinions . 
  it 's called a `` report '' and yes ... they get paid for that . 
  i mean ... germans read bild . 
  you mean russian ? 
   he actually put the debt under control for the first time in decades in greece . 
  [ you ca n't imagine ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/10895239/greece-sues-for-7-billion-euros-over-german-submarines-that-have-never-sailed.html ), 
  i delete my post and i apologise, 
  yeah ... they do nothing for the daily violations of the greek airspace tho . 
  i am not so sure if they will help . 
  they will probably send their wishes . 
  how will be greece finished anyway ? 
  turkey has the edge only in land . 
  greece has the slight edge in airspace and in aa . 
  it would be disastrous for turkey to attack greece or vice verca right now . 
  if greece cuts back , then gg . 
  also , the military spending has been reduced by 30 % since 2010 . 
  the gdp fell by 30 % and the gdp % of military spending stayed the same . 
  it 's safe to say that the military spending is reduced by 30 % so yeah . 
  eh ... while it 's true that greece did all that and not only greece ( many more countries lied about their debts including italy and spain ) , what europe is doing the past 7 years is ridiculous . 
   and now your claiming to be upset because , despite the fact that you still do n't collect around 30 % of your tax revenue , which exists as a grey market , meaning you ca n't even afford current repayments , everyone else is the bad guy for what , not giving greece the money it wants out of solidarity ? 
  the thing greece sure as hell was n't thinking of when it was doing it ? 
  you just made a full post saying essentially nothing . 
  what is your solution ? 
  `` punish greece for an eternity '' ? . 
  i am not sure if you realize what the loss of 30 % of gdp and 25 % unemployment means even yourself . 
  tax evasion ? 
  how can you solve tax evasion when people can not afford to pay taxes because they either have to pay those or their rent ? 
   fuck off mate . 
  saying 5-10 bullshits and then flaming . 
  oh god ...  then after trying to hide it for as long as possible the shit hits the fan and it no longer becomes possible you go to the eu and say `` heh sorry about that , but now we need money because if we do n't where going to crash out of the eu and damage everyone 's economy by making the eurozone crash '' . 
  this is your biggest misconception . 
  greece did n't want more money ... never . 
  europe could not afford to deal with greece back in 2008 and decided to kick the can down the road by loaning greece the biggest loan , in absolute numbers , in human history on condition that greece will shrink the income ( gdp ) that those loans must get paid from .
