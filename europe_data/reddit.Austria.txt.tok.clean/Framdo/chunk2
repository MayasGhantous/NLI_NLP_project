  talk about some nonsenses and some fucks up ... [ they can tell you that they fucked up themselves anyway ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/05/imf-admit-mistakes-greek-crisis-austerity ), 
  president of the eurogroup ( peg ) so yeah ... peg is netherlands essentialy . 
   nl says no to what imf is suggesting and that there are multiple projections for the greek growth . 
  tbh there is no politician in europe that wants to admit that greece 's debt is unsustainable . 
  it means that the programs were useless and he just agreed multiple times to throw money into a hole . 
  important points : * imf does n't want to say that the greek debt is sustainable just to help greece go out to the markets and wants a lower primary surplus and lower growth . 
  * germany does n't back up ( 3,5 % primary surplus for many decades , austerity , no debt restructure ) . 
  * imf says that more specific measures are needed . 
  * greek minister of economics say that he had very rough negotiations with imf and a veto from nl and germany and that 's why he accepted so hard measures , thinking they can find a compromise between them . 
  * france says that the debt needs to be prolongated for about 17 years with a primary surplus of 2 % after 2022 and not 3,5 % but imf needs to be onboard . 
  * shauble ( ouauhu ) says `` good luck , we wo n't find solution '' since imf does n't compromise . 
  * italy says that things can be improved and wonders why there is no solution . 
  asks imf what 's going on . 
  * ~ ~ slovania ~ ~ slovakia says that `` we all did mistakes , including the imf . 
  what matters is that the austerity wo n't affect esfs and esm . 
  asks why imf thinks that greek economy wo n't grow more than 1 % / year for so long . 
  * nl says no to what imf is suggesting and that there are multiple projections for the greek growth . 
  * austria says that if greece has 1 % growth for the next 40 years what 's the point of the program ? 
  imf needs to decide . 
  we ca n't have discussions about new measures every 4 weeks . 
  asks imf to bet that if europe is right about the greek growth imf will have to pay double . 
  ( rofl ) * eurogroup 's chief says that imf should join without paying . 
  imf just needs to agree . 
  imf says that they will think about joining and paying later . 
  * greece says that `` this option is the worst . 
  we have negotiated a so painful program , so that the imf can say that the greek debt is sustainable so we can go out to the markets . 
  * imf says that they fully understand the dissappointment of greece but there is no agreement for the debt . 
  says that imf can pay later but only on condition that the debt will become sustainable . 
  i died . 
  that means that there is 45 % youth unemployment . 
   and btw that was the point ... 
  and in greece too ... 
  here ... we found the guy that does n't know shit about how a business works . 
  there is no agenda or methology . 
  of course stats like that say nothing . 
  but it 's a good data to have . 
  germans obviously have very high productivity due to the industries that they have developed and the infrastructure . 
  and here i thought that the average german spends 1.500 hours annualy producing only white socks and sandals . 
  oh . . how deluded i was . 
  even by that alone you should understand that it 's not the case . 
   faking their data for example til : every country in the eurozone is a criminal . 
  burn them all !, 
  hail misinformation . 
  [ they did it once ] ( http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=675982 ), 
  http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/02/greece-says-new-bailout-terms-agreed-with-lenders.html https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/greece-reaches-new-debt-relief-deal-with-creditors-058xsldjd where does it say about 115 out of 140 ? 
  the problem is that this time greece agreed to do all the reforms . 
  poor sweden . 
  / r/austria eh i am really out of touch with austria nowadays so i do n't really know . 
  / r/greece is a shithole . 
  stay away . 
  yeah ... everyone wants to get stucked in athens without much food , being a prostitute or going to berlin and spend months inside a fucking tent waiting to be deported if he is not legitimate . 
  worth the risk of getting killed . 
  / s also , you need to open a dictionary and learn what the words `` open '' and `` borders '' mean . 
  the ugly truth is that we have open borders ? 
  that 's why thousands of people are drowning ... right ? 
  and this guy is getting upvoted . 
  ah ok ... you just proved right the first impression i had of you that you are ignorant or idiot ... or both . 
  no problem . 
  you are simplifying a very complex matter with a very poor generalization . 
  educate yourself on the matter first and then we can start having a discussion . 
  until then , good luck . 
   almost everyone tried to scheme him . 
  a few people * maybe * ? 
  i ve visited the whole europe and people have tried to trick me . 
  imagine if i was doing an internship . 
  also ... i do n't see how your argument is relevant to the discussion at all . 
   people are just incapable of keeping a level headed point of view in this case because of all the totally unsupported conspiracy theories regarding him being extradited to the us from sweden because sweden has n't extradited anyone to us ... right ? 
  yeah ... / r/europe is disgusting when it comes to refugees . 
  i did n't say that it 's exclusive and what exactly is n't true ? 
  that many of the weapons greece is buying are from germany ? 
  the military spending has been radically cut anyway . 
  it is the same percentage of gdp but keep in mind that the greek gdp has been cut by 30 % over the last years . 
   funny how this rarely is mentioned because the weapons are being purchased from germany and many german officials were/are part of the problem . 
  greece also won eurobasket that year . 
  do you guys watch eurovision ? 
  * unsubscribes * ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
   i do n't think mr. varoufakis is a good source on this matter . 
  is [ nsa ] ( https://www.vox.com/2015/7/2/8883307/merkel-nsa-wikileaks-greek-crisis ) a good enough souce or you want merkel and schauble themselves to tell you ? 
  from the way i see it , varoufakis is by far the best source you have . 
  he is not a politician anymore and he never was for more than 6 months , which means that he never played the game . 
  noone has ever disputed his claims . 
  / u/xnicolex for reference . 
  according to [ this ] ( https://www.toytowngermany.com/wiki/german_taxes ) your numbers are off . 
  moreover , you have to understand that in greece the money that exist on the market are way less while ** the cost of living is the same as in germany . 
  ** let 's not forget that businesses get taxed even if they make ** 1 euro ** and that individuals if they make more than 5k . 
  also , there are more bullshits like that your property is being taxed with its ' ** 2007 ** value when the house market was booming . 
  my father 's house who is no longer living in greece obviously used to cost 350k back then , now i doubt that you can even find a buyer and if you do it will cost about 100k . 
  according to / u/gluer for every 1.000 euros he makes he keeps the 389 and that without the recent increase in taxes . 
   is n't austerity in greece kind of working ? 
   he said it  here he directly admits it . 
  he says it 's not hacking because the tax data `` belongs to the ministry '' , so there 's no crime . 
  so it was not hacking ? 
   in the end he put grexit on the table as a bluff what ? 
  when ? 
  god damn it man ... what i understand is that many greeks have really short memory . 
  source for that ? 
  [ how dare you ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afl9wfgje0m ), 
  what do you mean by bluffing ? 
  he really did n't want to sign because he knew that the greek debt is unsustainable . 
  he wanted to make a parallel payment system that would give some breath to the greek economy while the banks were closed and on the same time he wanted to threaten that he will restructure a small amount of greek debt that would basically fuck up the qe due to court rullings between ecb and german banks .
