  not to mention that you ruined the hre and humiliated austria . 
  now , i do n't * hate * you . 
  i 'm just not particularly fond of you either . 
  whatever the poorest nation with the least impact on trade is . 
  or france . 
  that 'd probably wreck the economy though . 
  france is too big . 
   fritz unless you 're talking about someone with the first name fritz , you forgot an l. 
  why replace at least rudimentarily educated unemployed with completely uneducated unemployed ? 
  our unemployed stand a better chance of gaining a job than your average african would . 
  500 roma in a small village is n't going to end well . 
  and this whole `` the police did n't care '' thing is what happens when you call the police racist for everything . 
  [ same as they did n't investigate that gang-rape thing for a long time because the perpetrators were muslims , getting more teenage girls raped . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9253250/rochdale-grooming-trial-police-accused-of-failing-to-investigate-paedophile-gang-for-fear-of-appearing-racist.html ) it 's not racist to investigate crime . 
   police team is being taught their language to engage with the migrants directly rather than work through interpreters that is their solution to people getting death threats ? 
  language lessons ? 
  how about arresting those that did it and locking them up ? 
  how about teaching the immigrants the local language instead of the police a foreign one ? 
  the wage gap is a myth . 
  women make the same for the same work across the first world . 
  they just tend to not do the same work , work less , different jobs , pause their career to care for their family ... 
  yep . 
  if you drive through an area with lower income , people are still really impressed by a bmw . 
  the more expensive ones even work on the lower middle class . 
  i 'd say you just need more to impress here because people make more . 
  one of their first actions was to burn a pile of money because they believe in the `` wage gap '' . 
  that tells me all i need to know about them . 
  hold up your pants , since you slide them down to get your dock out . 
  we generally only use one hand . 
  as nice as it would be , the average dick is n't big enough to require two hands to point properly . 
  i hope they properly commit to integrate them or they 'll get more ghettoization . 
  nice thing to do though . 
  5 % of your countrymen voted for the feminist initiative in the eu elections . 
  i 'd say at least they did n't know that . 
   they are wasting our lives and killing our dreams and hopes why would the greek government be responsible for your hopes and dreams ? 
   all of that while none of us has committed any crime illegal immigration is a crime . 
  if they want out so bad , they can always leave greece . 
   our only fault was that we did n't have a piece of paper . 
  no , that you did n't have permission to stay in the country you were in . 
  it just happens to be printed on a piece of paper . 
   now we are forced to suffer in greece . 
  you can leave . 
  [ they have crazy feminists ] ( http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/pc-preschool-bans-words-him-and-her/story-e6frfhk6-1226082516997 ) , [ no , seriously ] ( http://pastebin.com/in731zma ) . 
  [ economic left/right : 0.50 social libertarian/authoritarian : 2.05 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ridbgto.png ), 
  i am not . 
  maybe a tiny bit of joking . 
  i simply think that a monarch is a much more efficient system than the current democracies . 
  and after others see how much good a restored habsburg monarchy would do to austria , some of our lost territories might decide they want to join us again . 
  and with that , we 'd have more military power again ... 
  true , but she lost silesia . 
   you and what army ? 
  one step after the other . 
  first , we vote to return to a constitutional monarchy . 
  and then our emperor will know what to do to get our lost territories back . 
  they got it in the first place too . 
  if the us did n't want ships sunk maybe they should n't have carried warmaterial . 
  without us intervention , there would n't have been concessions from us . 
  we 'd have overrun the french in a matter of months . 
  franz joseph i would be pretty high on the list of course . 
  he united austria and nearly brought us back to our old strength again . 
  we still exist , the habsburgs still exist . 
  austria can rise again . 
  no , i 'm an ultra-monarchist prick that is grieving for concessions made to the allies in wwi . 
  an empire is by definition not really nationalist . 
  hitler hunted the habsburgs . 
  it 's still foreign and its influence should be reduced . 
  we went from [ the big one ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tlikulv.gif ) to being the tiny western part thanks to the us interfering in wwi , which was none of their business . 
  we lost our emperor too , and an efficient and wise government was replaced by idiots that ca n't agree on anything . 
  the us destroyed this country . 
  we ca n't do much more than petty stuff at our current size , but something would be better than nothing or , worse , calling the us our friend . 
  because the non-smokers that get very annoyed by smoke are the minority . 
  most non-smokers do n't really care . 
  yes . 
  everything that pisses off the us is good . 
  plus all that `` whistleblowers should n't be persecuted '' thing . 
  i tend to agree , although not about christianity . 
  christianity is a foreign religion , one that has barely anything to do with the land here . 
  it 's a desert religion while europe is a fertile land . 
  hellenism , asatru , those are european religions . 
  smoking is ok in moderation too . 
  i smoke a cigar about once in one or two months , my doctor has no problem with that . 
  solution : do n't go there . 
  why should others stop enjoying themselves because you do n't like how they 're doing it ? 
  the smoking rooms in bars are already bad enough . 
  do n't give them any ideas . 
  if you do n't like smoke , do n't work in the hospitality field .

  oh yeah , we have those sleeves too since all those `` these things are going to kill you '' texts on them are a bit disturbing . 
  those packets are disgusting . 
  they could at least have gone with the `` plain white '' option rather than the `` gruesome pictures '' one . 
   it is not acceptable to allow the tobacco industry to use deceptive marketing gimmicks to lure our children into this deadly addiction cigarette packages are hardly designed to appeal to children or hide the effects of smoking . 
  what 's next , the alcoholic livers on all whiskey bottles ? 
  i hope they stick with cigarettes at least , ireland has some really great pipe tobacco and i 'd hate to have to shift all of that into other tins . 
   most government budgets are more than balanced if they would n't have to pay interest . 
  so would my budget be if i could borrow for free . 
  borrow a bit of money , build a housing block , rent it out , pay back the money . 
  rinse and repeat until i own a whole city . 
  i 'm a monarchist . 
  the less monarchies around , the less the chance of austrians getting their head straight again .
