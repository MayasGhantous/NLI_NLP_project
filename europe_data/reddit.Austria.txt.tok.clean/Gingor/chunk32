  we 'd just need to reacquire the other provinces . 
  ~ ~ rename it to the holy roman empire , restructure it as an empire on the model of rome , press our claims as successor of rome to [ everything that rome owned ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/roman_empire_trajan_117ad.png ) . ~ ~ ~ ~ make the official languages german and latin . ~ ~ ~ ~ capital is vienna , of course . ~ ~ ~ ~ then give up the throne to the current head of house habsburg . 
  or marry into that family and stay emperor . ~ ~ let me rethink that . 
  declare us the second roman empire ( with original structure ) , make the capital rome , the official language latin , and then start reconquering our [ lost territory ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/roman_empire_trajan_117ad.png ) . 
  i stay emperor . 
  no official religion , but i 'd restore pagan temples and monuments and cut any and all benefits to monotheistic churches . 
  considering that they 've stormed a tv station , i 'd say yes . 
  maybe you 're right and they 're just normal right parties . 
  i do n't know enough about them to make that call . 
  all i 'm saying that at least to people in the german sphere , they look very much like the neonazis we have here , even without russia saying anything . 
  either they have a fascist problem , or they have an image problem . 
  why exactly do people get kicked out of school for having sex to begin with ? 
  a little reprimand for doing it on school-time would be enough , no ? 
  letting the girl stay is unfair though . 
  austria has some kind of monument to the fallen/missing local soldiers in basically every village , one for each world war . 
  in mine , a mass gets read at the wwii one once a year , and police and military marches and a brass band plays and the mayor has a speech , etc. 
  i think it 's the same in most towns here . 
  i generally do n't go as i 'm not christian . 
  some mix and match going on of course , some are bigger than others ... generally you get that black cross , an eagle , some black marble , maybe on an obelisk . 
  storming a tv station is n't just silly , it 's a very dangerous sign of a lack of press freedom . 
  as for right sector , look in the upper left corner of their website . 
  would you say that does n't look like neonazi protesters ? 
  and svoboda has the same members as it had before the name-change . 
  so ... why exactly would you consider it different from its predecessor ? 
  red and black are * very * common colors among neonazis here to prevent them getting accused of wiederbet\u00e4tigung ( an actual crime here ) . 
  i 'm not saying that ukraine is a fascist hellhole here , or that russia is any better . 
  i think your government has a clear influence by fascist parties , and the way you toppled the old government was n't exactly democratic either . 
  i do n't think the situation in ukraine is as easy as `` putin bad , kiev good '' . 
   like what parties namely right sector , which is n't in government , but is allowed to exist and has members , so some people are clearly interested in it . 
  and svoboda , which has actual seats in government . 
  they * look * like nazis and their flag ... well , who else had red and black ? 
  admittedly , right sector is n't too big of an influence . 
  it 's still alarming that you have such parties to begin with . 
  and you do n't just have right sector , you have also svoboda , who stormed a tv station and beat the director up . 
  and those people occupy government positions . 
  and svoboda 's predecessor had [ this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/i%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%8f_n%d0%b0%d1%86%d1%96%d1%97.svg ) as their logo . 
  this looks very similar to neonazi symbols to me , stark lines in black/white . 
  if you want to say that the government in kiev is n't ruled by fascists , fine . 
  but some people in it and parties there seem to have a lot of similarities to neonazis here when it comes to symbolism and their looks . 
  admittedly , i 'm not well enough informed about their actual policies to make a clear call ( and most sources are heavily biased , so learning more is hard ) about their policies . 
  they are in right sector . 
  as in , in the party . 
  [ just look at their website . ] ( http://pravyysektor.info/ ) . 
  they have people like that * in their logo * . 
  most countries have some right elements , very few have [ actual right-wing thugs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5ckstha.jpg ) . 
  i mean , look at them . 
  do those look to you like political activists to you ? 
  or more like a group of people itching for a fight ? 
  to me , they look identical to the neonazis we have here . 
  and not the political kind . 
  the `` go out and beat immigrants with baseball bats '' kind . 
  there 's actually newspapers in latin . 
  modern words have been developed for it too . 
  you can speak the latin language and still use arabic numerals . 
  it 'd actually be needed , what with roman numerals not having zeroes . 
  not particularly bitter . 
  english is very easy . 
  i 'd prefer latin as a common language though . 
  it 's more elegant . 
  english is a very simple language . 
  german would be good too of course . 
  ukraine is bordering civil war . 
  men die in war . 
  it happens . 
  they are women . 
  you do n't kill women . 
  so , not an actual transsexual ? 
  * gypsonia, 
  oy , why do the french get italy ? 
  mentality-wise , italy and greece would fit together better . 
  and turkey is n't even in europe , and is more looking like a dictatorship lately . 
  overall , i 'm against it , and not only because you are against monarchies . 
  the differences are too many , and the wealth difference alone would ravage northwestern europe . 
  being one country with the south would already be damaging enough , but being one country with the south and the east would just destroy us . 
  and that 's not even counting national differences . 
  ireland in one country with the uk ? 
  yeah , that 's gon na work out well . 
  greece and turkey ? 
  the whole balkan into one country ? 
  do n't think a few people might still be a bit salty about that whole `` war '' thing there that was only a few years ago ? 
  and the whole `` pacifist '' thing would weaken us too . 
  and i am sure the ukrainian police has no stake in the outcome of this investigation whatsoever . 
  i tend to agree . 
  at least kill people properly instead of burning them to death or suffocating them . 
  and stay away from women . 
  at least a puppet would be funny . 
  also , thanks for that . 
  have n't laughed this much in a while . 
  unless someone does some metal , i like the one with the hottest women best . 
  the austrian one is just terrible imho . 
  her voice is kinda broken in some passages and ... well , she 's a bearded lady . 
  well , i ca n't say that i 'm surprised . 
  then germany , which is n't surprising either , considering that austria is a german state . 
  we have a christian party ( cp\u00d6 ) , but nobody actually votes for them . 
  the communists have over 8 times their votes . 
  i do n't think even the cp\u00d6 members vote for the cp\u00d6 . 
  then there 's the `` we totally are n't the nazi party '' party , which also uses christianity ( `` occident in christian hand '' ) , but they blatantly are n't christian . 
  just racist . 
  [ here ] ( http://rt.com/news/156480-odessa-fire-protesters-dead/ ) it says someone was on the roof of the building , trapped with 50 others , including women . 
  only thing i can find on it though .
