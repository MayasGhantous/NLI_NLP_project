but you have bears . 
  do n't want my picnic basket stolen by a bear . 
  in total about 2500 $ i think . 
  if you do n't mind sleeping in cheap motels it 's really not that expensive . 
  sure !, 
  it 's 4 am here though so i 'll have to keep it short . 
  i took one trip to the us so far , drove from sf to ny within 3 weeks . 
  my girlfriend spent a month at the university of new orleans before that and met me in sf . 
  we also had a friend join us on our roadtrip so we were three people . 
  since we were in a bit of a hurry we never spent very much time at one place unfortunately . 
  because of that we did n't talk with too many people since we were driving a lot . 
  ** general impression ** when we planned our trip i was very much against driving all across the country because i was basically freaked out about how huge it is . 
  [ i 'm from a pretty small country myself ... ] ( https://mapfight.appspot.com/at-vs-usc/austria-united-states-contiguous-size-comparison ) in the end , this was what i liked best about the us . 
  there 's so much space !, 
  especially when we drove through arizona and nevada it really put things into perspective . 
  driving through the desert is awesome . 
  europe is crowded . 
  in austria we can take refuge in some valley but all in all there is barely anywhere you can go without stumbling over some kind of a settlement . 
  in the western us it 's obviously vastly different . 
  we met people who went camping inside death valley - you ca n't pitch a tent outside a camping ground ~ ~ anywhere in ~ ~ in most of europe . 
  but also in the eastern us there 's so much space . 
  i did n't spend to much time in cities but they seemed very condensed to me . 
  the few blocks of nyc i explored contained so much more than the same area of a european city . 
  i prefer our medieval buildings but it was certainly interesting . 
  older city buildings in the us are cool too so if you wait for a few hundred years we 'll probably envy you . 
  ** people ** what we noticed first is that americans are extremely nice compared to europeans . 
  this is something you hear a lot , often europeans complain that this niceness is only superficial . 
  i think that 's often not the case . 
  people were generally way more helpful and friendly than in europe . 
  now i like my typical austrian grumpy acquaintances at home , but especially when you are travelling you kind of rely on other people being willing to communicate . 
  after we left sf heading south we stopped to get something to eat . 
  when we wanted to pay we were told by the server that the family on the table next to us had paid our bill and wished us a nice trip . 
  just like this . 
  we were pretty amazed and would n't stop talking about this for the entire trip . 
  something like this has never happened to me in europe . 
  in general people at gas stations , bars , motels restaurants et cetera were always nice and willing to help us out if we had some kind of problem . 
  we had some extremely minor car troubles ( being a not very experienced driver this startled me a bit ) but were helped without issue . 
  once we got lost while searching for a cheap motel in monterey , asked someone on the sidewalk about the way and they called the motel they worked at and organized a cheap room for us . 
  small stuff like this made a huge difference to me . 
  in europe people are nice too , sure , but most will be more reserved at first . 
  there 's a chance to meet assholes everywhere but in europe it 's somehow socially tolerated . 
  there 's so much more but that was what sticked out to me most . 
  definitely planning to go to the us again . 
  it 's really the best country to travel by car i think and i 'm a bit shy when it comes to going to completely foreign places . 
  i 'd totally recommend every european to go to america too though . 
  europe is so influenced by american culture that many people do n't realize it anymore . 
  in the us you can see all the small differences between the old and the new world and get a decent understanding of western culture as a whole . 
  many people prefer to travel exotic locations such as asia , for me it 's maybe even more interesting to experience all those small differences that make you realize how special your own little corner of the world is . 
  well actually it stands for more than that . 
  `` geheim ** e ** '' , as in `` geheime staatspolizei '' . 
  the `` ge '' in `` gema '' actually stands for `` gestapo '' . 
  one of the very few dubs i enjoy is [ ein k\u00e4fig voller helden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgroxegbil8 ) , the german version of hogan 's heroes . 
  they gave the germans various accents ( schulz is a stereotypical bavarian , klink is a saupreiss , general burghalter a grumpy guy from vienna ) . 
  if you like the show and know some german do yourself a favour and watch a few dubbed episodes , it really adds to the show ( of course at the same time some jokes do n't translate well and the americans sound a little bit weird when dubbed ) . 
  also we austrian folks do n't see black people very often . 
  but this does n't apply to obraka here since he has fled the country . 
   and you have to go to it to get a necessary page whitelisted or you have to be it , which is pretty common within reddit 's audience . 
  ... while you are only employed for 5 , if you are unlucky . 
  i would n't say that . 
  i work part-time in first level it support ( helpdesk ) - as many people here i 'd say - and also sometimes as a janitor . 
  in both jobs there are times where i have to be ready ( so people can call or come to my office with their problems , or be somewhere quickly for repairs ) , but i have pretty much done everything i can do from my pc . 
  sure , ideally i should barely have any downtime , but in these jobs you sometimes just have to be available . 
  often i ca n't even leave the office to get something done because someone has to be available . 
  my supervisors explicitly told me that i can use downtimes for personal stuff , though it should obviously be appropriate and not distract me from my work . 
  so most of reddit is definitely okay for me to browse at work and i 'm thankful that people tag stuff as nsfw if i 'm in a subreddit like this . 
  oh and right now i 'm at home or i would even be in this thread . 
  i 've got one thing to add to all these lovely maps : directly beneath the castle there are a lot of caves . 
  they built a small bunker system in some of them to serve as a secret underground hospital . 
  nowadays it 's a lovely museum . 
  wow i suddenly got hungry . 
  are those pasties hard to prepare ? 
  i 've wanted to make something like this ever since i read game of thrones . 
  there might be some truth in that , popular bavarian humourists like polt or fredl fesl are very funny to me as a tyrolian . 
  however i do n't like most of our local comedians pretty much , but the more popular stuff from vienna is great . 
  that your women are crazy in the bedroom ? 
  ( good crazy ), 
  honestly , i pretty much only perceive the baltic states ( i 'll throw you all in the same pot here ) via discussions on reddit . 
  my impression : you guys do n't like russia , and especially the soviet union . 
  and communism in general . 
  yep , that 's about it . 
   ronaldo totally thought he was brazilian . 
   at least 30 % wrong that 's oddly precise . 
  and those guys want to join the eu , no thanks !, 
   humorless i know plenty of funny germans . 
  some even have some kind of humour . 
  however the comedy stuff that runs on german tv is just sad . 
  i know this goes for most countries but guys like mario barth would n't know humour they were bombed with it by the allies . 
  we 're generally perceived as evil , i 've got to say that surprised me . 
  but being the sad little remnant of an empire that we are i think we should be glad anyone still is at least pretending to be afraid of us . 
  however if i see that dumb and dumber reference one more time i might just kill that little american bastard in my cellar . 
  or / r/european if you prefer more racism instead of less . 
  yep , [ see here . 
  ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2c11xv/reurope_is_now_a_default_subreddit_for_europeans/cjaye3m ), 
  silly belgium , muslims do n't drink . 
  sounds french . 
   but i 'm on a crappy connection in delhi maybe the uk is n't included because you guys ca n't let go of the colonies ? 
  go move your colonies to europe if you want to be a part of our club !, 
  on a more serious note , i 'd welcome more russians in this subreddit regardless of cultural identity , if only to get a broader perspective on the eu 's issues with russia and the ukraine crisis . 
  for my taste it 's getting a little bit too circlejerky in here sometimes and a bigger userbase might be a good thing for a change , provided there 's some diversity . 
  crimea , amirite ?
