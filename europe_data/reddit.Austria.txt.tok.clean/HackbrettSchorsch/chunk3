  in tax , social and labour law , yes . 
  i have never heared of a provision requiring companies to safe anything outside this scope . 
  i see . 
  how 's that compatible with any potential fundamental rights regarding self-incrimination ? 
  in austria you 'd have to get a search warrant and look for the evidence yourself . 
  since when are you , the suspect , required to help the prosecutor ? 
  my understanding is that obstruction of justice only applies to anyone , but the suspect . 
  the constitution does not draw minimum requirements , but governs the fundamental legal framework of every country . 
  asylum is part of this framework and the german constitution also provides the limitation on asylum , which is obligatory and not free to choose for those enforcing the law . 
  that would be pure arbitrariness and illegal in any proper rechtsstaat ( abuse of power ) . 
  this is also why you can not compare art 16a to art 3 as the latter does not provide limitations . 
  so no , you can not increase the protection level , when there is a statute limiting it . 
  alright , i suppose the constitutional court has no clue either then . 
  16 a abs . 
  16a abs . 
  16a abs . 
  16 a abs . 
  16 a abs . 
  art 16a basic law for the federal republic of germany : ( 1 ) persons persecuted on political grounds shall have the right of asylum . 
  ( 2 ) paragraph ( 1 ) of this article may not be invoked by a person who enters the federal territory from a member state of the european communities or from another third state in which application of the convention relating to the status of refugees and of the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is assured . 
  the states outside the european communities to which the criteria of the first sentence of this paragraph apply shall be specified by a law requiring the consent of the bundesrat . 
  in the cases specified in the first sentence of this paragraph , measures to terminate an applicant 's stay may be implemented without regard to any legal challenge that may have been instituted against them . 
  young stalin was actually just as good looking as che and in contrast to him , stalin could grow a beard . 
  germany is not even enforcing its own constitution , ffs . 
  just to give you an idea how far this lunacy goes . 
  nope , mobilisation starts tomorrow . 
  no , it may not be illegal . 
  international law has no hierarchy therefore the convention on refugees is on the same level as the treaty with turkey . 
  the latter however derogates the first one as lex specialis and lex posterior . 
  german zalando is operating in many countries in europe . 
  not eu wide though : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zalando#/media/file:european_countries_in_which_zalando_operates.svg, 
  try working as much as men then . 
  women make 22 % less , but they also work 23 % less . 
  there is no pay gap . 
  only a working hour gap . 
  why ca n't we just always get along like that ? 
  one can only hope they succeed . 
  no , it would n't as the gcr is silent in this regard and when the integrity and sovereignty of a country is at stake , no international law is forcing it to assit its own demise . 
  it would be in clear contrast to every country 's ( and the people in it ) right to self-determination . 
  balanced by the same amount of german citizens . 
  so you 'll be fine . 
  he clearly does n't understand what his job is , does he ? 
  protipp : it ai n't economic migrants from marocco . 
  pretty sure they wo n't be fighting the british this time . 
  it happens to be fully automatic without a captain as well . 
  lucky them the girls were shooting like girls . 
  it 's like the russians do n't want to have nice things . 
  soundtrack was better though . 
  * and please do n't throw your id away when you come as we can not deport people without proper ids . 
  * shit intensifies . 
  looks like it is his [ internet porn night ] ( http://www.break.com/video/ugc/peters-internet-porn-night-191412 ) . 
  so bomb bucharest then ? 
  ficki ficki could have been better as well . 
  wow , thanks dw for this brilliant piece of journalism . 
  but cost a shitload of pension funds instead . 
  smokers tend to die early , which is good for the pension system . 
  sounds like an impartial investigation to me . 
   offending believers ' feelings we have the same fucking statute in austria . 
  how this could exist in a supposedly enlightened country is beyond me . 
  fuck you and your gods . 
  never . 
  german citizens have been brainwashed their entire life to just bend over and ask for more . 
  sure because getting rid of all his people is going to help assad ... 
  only a matter of time ... 
   as if there is a possibility that there will be a day where u ca n't buy pork anymore in germany ... that is not even remotely the point here . 
  well , they always have been the smartest europeans with regards to strategic decision making over centuries now . 
  why should it stop with the eu ? 
  this looks like somebody had to sneez with a bleeding nose . 
  well , most of those freedoms do not extent to illegal aliens and creating a cardboard sign wo n't change this . 
  also love the `` we 're not terrorists , so do n't destroy our homes '' sign . 
  i am no terrorists either , so i might build myself a new house in vienna 's volksgarten . 
  actually the first time removing kebap was n't used euphemistically . 
  translation :  according to a news report the federal ministry for economic affairs considers the costs of a permanent re-introduction of border checks to not create any dramatic cost increases . 
  `` the economic implications altogether should be negligable '' , according to an interal paper of the ministry provided to the `` welt am sonntag '' . 
  `` waiting queues at border crossings '' and `` effects on the supply lines '' of enterprises might occure . 
  nevertheless is it the opinion of vice-chancellor sigmar gabriel 's resort that fears of the economy are unfounded . 
  of course you can . 
  who 's going to stop you from doing it ? 
  germany is also as rational thinking as a teenage girl . 
  everything is unfair . 
  their asylum policy could n't be further to the left . 
  which is why we declared them illegal while driving for other people 's well-being sake . 
  should we do the same with islam , to finish your analogy ? 
  and you seem to think that people are the problem with fundamentalism and not the foundation it builds upon . 
  apparently did n't help much . 
  door policy should start at the border , but since left wing politics have broken europe 's spine , we should get used to it . 
  not this shit again . 
  i explained in length , why that is utter bullshit . 
  you do n't get deported for [ smoking a joint ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47uc2y/swiss_hold_divisive_referendum_on_deporting_petty/d0frwrw ) or [ speeding ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47uc2y/swiss_hold_divisive_referendum_on_deporting_petty/d0fy02w ) . 
  these are not among the [ offences listed in the initiative ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47uc2y/swiss_hold_divisive_referendum_on_deporting_petty/d0fqgu3 ) and apprently left wing propaganda convinced everybody that these could get you deported . 
  no , it can not . 
  you could be speeding a thousand times and nothing would happen in this regard . 
  you could be caught smoking a joint a hundred times and nothing would happen . 
  mateschitz is not the richest austrian . 
  that would be ferdinand piech with an estimated fortune of [ $ 33.8 billions ] ( http://www.vermoegen.org/ferdinand-piech-vermoegen/ ), 
  any criminal offense triggers the first condition , but it does n't get you deported , which is why claiming speeding gets you expelled is bullshit and simply not true . 
  only the offenses listed in art 2 of the initiative can get you deported if you have a previous record . 
  the initiative is not badly written as they do n't want you to get deported for speeding and other offenses not listed . 
  does n't matter what the bundesverordnung says on speeding . 
  it is not mentioned in the initiative .
