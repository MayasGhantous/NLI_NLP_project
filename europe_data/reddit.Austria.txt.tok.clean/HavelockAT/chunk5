  `` unoccupied for longer than 6 months '' sounds like `` you do n't need it anyway '' . 
  the election was n't about `` giving up your town '' , it was about refugees . 
  what do you mean ? 
  edit : i thought the question was about our ** actual ** most important ally . 
  germany, 
  so you 're saying that the voters being christians does n't have any effect at all ? 
  why is this different with muslims ? 
  of course it 's different . 
  i just wanted to show that christians are able to enforce laws to kill someone besides self defense . 
  well , i never chose to become an atheist . 
  at least you 're consistent . 
  so what 's all that `` in god we trust '' stuff about ? 
  i think it 's at least debatable if you can choose what you believe . 
  imho i did n't choose to be an atheist , it just happens that i do n't believe in god . 
  you can just decide whether you follow the rules of your deity and which ones you follow . 
  as long as you do n't harm anyone there 's no problem . 
  it starts to become a problem if you want to influence others . 
  but your argument sounds like `` acting on your sexuality is something you choose , so it 's ok to discriminate against acting homosexuals '' . 
  where 's the difference ? 
  in everyday usage we also define `` discrimination against a specific religion '' as racism . 
  we regularly have problems with hooligans . 
  how many times does it have to happen before we can start saying `` hey , you know what , football fans really * are * trouble , so let 's ban football '' ? 
  that 's called `` lagerkoller '' or `` cabin fever '' . 
  / r/patpet is talking about '' ** very ** right winged '' . 
  that 's the source of many mayor problems . 
  germany has the npd , which is regularly the source of violence . 
  racism is the cancer for humanity . 
  it 's not that hard to find out . 
  just talk to them . 
  she invited all ** syrians ** and is still taking them in . 
  ok , thanks , now i know that you do n't want to discuss seriously . 
   would you say that denazification in germany was more extreme than in austria ? 
  that clearly was the case . 
  the austrian government suceeded with their `` interpretation '' that austria was the 1st victim of the nazis . 
  they long denied that austria ( and much more austrians ) played an important role in the ns regime . 
  compared to germany denazification was a joke . 
  until the 80s the topic was hardly ever raised in austria . 
  my parents hardly learn anything about it in history classes . 
  the duscussion mainly started in 1986 , when kurt waldheim , former secretary-general of the united nations , ran for federal president in the 1986 elections . 
  during the election campaign it was released ( by his opponents ) that he was a member of the sa and made a carreer in the wehrmacht . 
  he never mentioned anything about this in his cv and after the topic was raised he strongly denied his membership . 
  ( later he said that he could n't remember if he was a member of the sa . ), 
  he made statements like `` i just fulfilled my duty as a soldier '' , or , much worse , `` the international press is dominated by jewish world congress . 
  everyone knows that . '', 
  many sides , including several foreign countries , strongly opposed waldheim as a candidate , which leads to reactions like `` we austrians vote for whoever ** we ** want to vote '' . 
  waldheim won the election and got isolated in many western countries . 
  the usa even denied him to travel to the usa . 
  due to the discussions austria started to seriously discuss its part in the 3rd reich . 
  1991 vranitzky was the 1st austrian chancellor who confessed the crimes committed by austrians and asked the victims for their forgiveness . 
  ( i.e. 
  41 years after the end of the war ! ), 
  it 's very hard to give an un-biassed summary . 
  i 'm strongly afgainst the fp\u00d6 , so take my summary with caution . 
  :-) after wwii the nazis were banned from voting . 
  1949 they were allowed to vote again . 
  while the two big parties sp\u00d6 ( social democrats ) and \u00d6vp ( people 's party , comparable to christian democrat parties in europe ) tried to get the votes of the former nazis ( and somewhat succeeded ) , the vdu ( which later became the fp\u00d6 ) was founded as an alternative to the two big parties . 
  many former ss/sa/nsdap members voted them or became members . 
  even till 1978 [ friedrich peter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_peter ) , a former obersturmf\u00fchrer of the ss , was the head of the fp\u00d6 . 
  for a long time the fp\u00d6 mainly attracted former nazis and other far right wing people , but also a group of liberal people who wanted an alternative to the two big parties . 
  in the 80s norbert steger became head of the fp\u00d6 and tried to turn the party into a liberal party like the german [ fdp ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fdp ) . 
  1983 ( when the sp\u00d6 lost its absolute majority ) they even formed a coalition with the sp\u00d6 . 
  the plan was n't very successful and the party lost one state election after the other - except for the carinthian fp\u00d6 , lead by j\u00f6rg haider . 
  j\u00f6rg haider opposed steger 's plans for a liberal fp\u00d6 and was heavily supported by the german nationalists in the party . 
  1986 they moved steger out of office and haider was elected as head of the fp\u00d6 . 
  thus the sp\u00d6 broke the coalition and the fp\u00d6 was in opposition , again . 
  haider was not only in favor of german nationalism , he also had good connections to the nazi scene . 
  he regularly joined the [ urlichsberg gatherings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulrichsberg_gathering ) and made statements like `` in the 3rd reich they had a properly employment policy '' . 
  but haider always knew that he needed liberal and protest voters as well , so he made his main campaign against the establishment . 
  statements like `` they are against him [ haider ] because he is on your side '' or `` now more than ever '' ( i could n't find a better translation for `` jetzt erst recht '' ) , both against the `` establishment '' who constantly critisized him , were part of his main campaign . 
  later he strongly was against the eu ( another form of the establishment ) . 
  the second part of his campaign was against foreigners . 
  statements like `` the government gives foreigners hormones so they become more fertilise than austrians '' were normal fp\u00d6 propaganda . 
  he aslo brought calculations like `` we have xxx unemployed people and yyy foreigners '' , just like the nsdap did with jews . 
  but haider did n't seem to be islamophob , he even had good connections to muslim statesmen like saddam hussein and especially gadaffi . 
  haider had a very good friendship with one of gadaffis sons . 
  2000 the fp\u00d6 became member of the austrian government again , which leads to two serious fights in the fp\u00d6 . 
  the latter one resulted in haider forming a new party ( bz\u00d6 ) and all of the former fp\u00d6 secretaries of states and almost all former fp\u00d6 members of parliament left with him . 
  his plan was to let the far right german nationalist part behind him in the fp\u00d6 ( which succeeded ) , form a new party without financial debts ( which did n't succeed so good , because the fp\u00d6 sued his new party and partly had success ) and hoped that the former fp\u00d6 voters would all go with him and vote for the bz\u00d6 ( which worked even worse , the bz\u00d6 is n't part of the austrian parliament or any state parliament except for carinthia anymore and the fp\u00d6 is stronger than ever ) . 
  strache took over what was left in the fp\u00d6 . 
  at the next election ( 2006 ) the fp\u00d6 already became stronger than the bz\u00d6 and the bz\u00d6 had to leave the government . 
  since this time the fp\u00d6 was constantly growing . 
  strache took over some parts of haiders campaings ( especially against foreigners ) , but it somewhat changed : 1 . 
  campaigns against foreigners became more important . 
  the general term `` foreigners '' changed into muslims . 
  strache tried to get votes from immigrants , esp . 
  serbians , and succeedes very well . 
  campaigns against homosexuality and `` gender terrorism '' also grew in importance . 
  ( i do n't know any homophobic statements from haider . ), 
  at least haider did n't just protest , he also had solutions . 
  ( i did n't like them , but that 's debatable . ), 
  strache has no solutions at all . 
  no , but the fp\u00d6 is much more than that . 
  homophobic , islamophobic , anti eu , good connections to far right student groups ...

  the fp\u00d6 has no answers at all .
