  driving a car . 
   fixing this problem needs to start organically from within their culture . 
  true , but this takes time and does n't help the refugees who need shelter * now * . 
  and we also ca n't deny the western involvement in the problems in middle east . 
   fine , send their women and children as refugees uhm , what ? 
  women have to right to come to us , but men do n't ? 
  sounds very sexist to me . 
   `` as a whole '' , they are n't looking to change their culture , but bring their culture that is antithetical to western values to europe . 
  i ca n't verify that . 
  refugees who make troubles are a minority . 
  like / u/pm _ your_favorte_song said : it 's too complex . 
  i do n't think that `` muslim '' is the problem . 
  the problems are * different culture ( it 's more the regional culture than religion . 
  some moslems come from a culture which is way more compatible , some non-moslems have serious differences , too . 
  and , of course , it 's personal attitude too . ), 
  * bad distribution ( we do n't have too much refugees in the eu , but some regions have much more refugees than others ) * a union with too less powers to handle the problem efficiently * too less communication with worried people * infrastructure which is n't well enough * hate speech the problems are complex , but i think we can solve them . 
  ** and ** i think that * not * taking refugees would cause even worse problems . 
  if you do n't want to see the difference between a war and a murder you bring extreme right-wing agenda . 
  i doubt that france had accepted the agreement so willingly if uk was n't an eu member . 
  one of the reasons fpr the agreement is that france has to take back the refugees anyway ( dublin iii ) , but that does n't apply to non eu members . 
  they are stopped as calais . 
  not all ofc , but a considerable number . 
  not normal , but many germans and austrians commit similar murders . 
  ah , apropos austria ... were the fritzl crimes christian crimes ? 
  which muslim attacks ? 
  is this a muslim attack because the killer happens to be a muslim ? 
  is every murder committed by a christian a christian attack ? 
  thanks . 
  the racism in the last days is disgusting . 
  over-sensitive newspapers ? 
  so every rampage is a terrorist attack ? 
  yes , because of the eu - which you are leaving now . 
  too many ? 
  we have a few % . 
  that 's the point , yes . 
  women who are not up to standard * are * harassed or victim blamed . 
   burka , niqab and maybe even chador are not fine . 
  because you say so ? 
   if they want to , for religious reasons , they are n't compatible with western civilization why ? 
  our civilization is not christian only . 
  we have jews , atheists , muslims and some others , too . 
  could we throw out our german nationalists too ? 
  if we do , we can cancel the 3rd run of our presidental elections because hofer would be deported to germany . 
  the catholic church wo n't like it so it wo n't happen . 
   gay people can be gay openly the european right thinks differently . 
  just ask pegida , afd or fp\u00d6 . 
   it was basically islamist lite vs islamist hardline . 
  i hardly know g\u00fclen . 
  he would be islamist hardline , right ? 
   and the us threatened to evict turkey from nato if they implement the death penalty ( which is a bit hypocritical tbh ) why ? 
  yes , the us has death penalty too , but the main issue is the post factum implementation . 
  us did n't do that . 
  if you pay fees at domestic atms , your bank is allowed to charge the same fees in the eurozone . 
  eu law mandates that the use of atms in the eurozone must be treated like the use of domestic atms . 
  so if you do n't pay atm fees in your own country , you wo n't pay any fees abroad , as long as you do n't leave the eurozone . 
  and what about san marino , andorra , monaco and scv ? 
  they have agreements with the eu and are allowed to mint own coins . 
  i have accounts at german banks , too , and they do n't charge any atm fees , too . 
  ( dkb and number26 ), 
  i just withdraw cash locally at atms . 
  no , we do n't . 
  that 's just a lie of right-wing campaigns . 
  point taken . 
  we even speak the same language . 
  :-) and , like metternich said : `` the balkans begin at the rennweg '' ( a street in the 3rd district of vienna ) . 
  please change the election rules for the eu parliament . 
  i want to be able to vote for eu wide parties and not only austrian meps , like i 'm able to vote for members of my national parliament who do n't live in the same state as i do . 
  germany did n't . 
  we share a border with germany , too , and we fail at running a presidential election . 
   and have an army and ** financial central ** unlike the buffer states the financial central is already planning to move to the `` buffer states '' . 
  you ca n't unilaterally change international treaties . 
  do n't let the door hit you on the way out . 
  ... and i 'm glad . 
  why should uk get a better deal than the other 27 members ? 
  why should the uk show the whole world that the uk does n't keep their agreements ? 
  austria too . 
  ah , you 're right . 
  it 's somewhat like the queen : in theory he has a lot of powers ( e.g. 
  firing the prime minister and all cabinet members and replace them with whoever he wants ) , but it 's part of the `` unwritten constitution '' ( tradition ) that he does n't use most of his powers . 
  in the past we had hardly any exceptions - and they were in unusual circumstances , e.g. 
  the current president vetoed a law which accidentally included a penal provision with retroactive effect . 
  ( parliamentary procedures took longer than expected and the mps forgot to change the date of effectiveness before they passed the law . 
  penal law with retroactive effect violates the echr - which is part of the austrian constitution . ), 
  however , nobody guarantees that any future president will follow this uwritten , non binding rule . 
  actually hofer already stated that he 'll use his right to dismiss the government and his right to veto international treaties if he feels it 's in austrian 's best interest . 
  he specifically said that he 'll veto ceta and ttip if the government wo n't hold a referendum ( or if the referendum fails , ofc ) . 
  van der bellen , otoh , said that he 'll veto ttip too ( he did n't mention ceta iirc ) and he would n't give strache ( fp\u00d6 leader ) a mandate to form a government even if the fp\u00d6 got the most votes in a general election . 
  yes . 
  it was predicted that van der bellen only had a chance to win if turnout was high . 
  turnout was high and he won . 
  fp\u00d6 just appealed against the 2nd round , but if they had appealed against both round , it 'd be very likely that noth rounds were overturned . 
  [ here 's the english version ] ( https://www.vfgh.gv.at/cms/vfgh-site/attachments/9/6/5/ch0003/cms1467363707042/press_release_07-01-16.pdf ), 
  not everywhere . 
  in some places even the smaller envelope was opened . 
   i seem to recall hearing that this was common practice for the past 30 years , which makes this even more insane ( in the sense that it did n't lead to any elections being overturned prior to that yes . 
  the constitutional court said that it did n't have a chance to overturn any election for this reason before , because until now nobody has filed an appeal on this grounds . 
  the court is only allowed to check the arguments used in the appeal . 
  if all voting stations close at the same time ( or start counting after the last station has closed ) , it 's virtually impossible to leak any information . 
  it 's nothing special , in almost every election the green party has more postal votes than general votes and the fp\u00d6 has less postal votes . 
  it would be surprising if they hadn ' have this time .
