  one roommate did it as you discribe , put it to the drying area still full of soap , she was like me from austria living in germany . 
  i thought it 's gross , but did n't complain when she did the dishes and i 'm still alive eating from those plates , so it did n't really bother me too much . 
  never . 
  born around 1985 . 
  but a lot of people i grew up with said that their parents slapped them once or twice , and the saying `` a gsunde watschn hat noch niemandem geschadet '' ( a healthy slap in the face never harmed anyone ) is quite common , even if it 's illegal . 
  not sure , better ask them !, 
  edit : sure that the train goes that way , not sure if it 's included . 
  you should have a look if this `` one country '' - eurail ticket is interesting for you : http://www.eurail.com/en/eurail-passes/one-country-pass/benelux it includes rides within belgium , netherlands , and the train ride with the eurostar train between london and brussels . 
  take a look at the mandetory reservation fees for most trains , but it could be cheaper than flying to brussels/amsterdam from london . 
  flying to madrid from there will be the best option . 
  i agree with most other people that you could think about skipping z\u00fcrich if there is no particular reason why you want to go there . 
  as it is your honeymoon , i 'd suggest to reduce the cities you stay in and book nice hotels just for berlin and rome . 
  so you can unpack your stuff , relax and feel at home at your hotel and the surrounding area . 
  that does n't mean you only visit those 2 cities . 
  you can do great daytrips from both cities !, 
  from berlin , there are good train connections to dresden , hamburg and leipzig ( each about 2 hours away , book in advance for a good price like 19-29euro / person each direction ) , as well as a lot of closer smaller cities/nice places . 
  you could also go to poland like szczecin or poznan . 
  from rome , you could do a day trip to neaples and pompeij ( 2h train ride away ) or florence ( 1.5 h train ride away ) . 
  if you do it that way , you would be a lot less stressed about packing and unpacking , checking in to hotels , changing currency ( swiss does n't use euros ) , going to and from airports who are often outside of the city , ect . 
  you just need a small backpack for the day and in the evening , you are `` home '' at your hotel . 
  and you could just skip the day trip if you do n't feel like it and be more flexible if the weather is bad ( like save the daytrip for the next day and spend the day in a museum in berlin instead ) but if you want to see as many countries as possible , adding a third destinations is absolutely possible , especially if you stay 14 days . 
  i 'd suggest something you are really interested in ? 
  maybe salzburg ( sound of music , hiking , relaxing - will be cold in february ) , paris ( sightseeing , if it 's cold you could stay in the louvre all day ) , athens ( history stuff ) , amsterdam , london , barcelona or dubrovnik + kotor ( not sure how easy to get there by plane from berlin ) . 
  as you very likely have to fly anyway , distances do n't really matter that much . 
  how should we know ? 
  i 've never watched a game , so i ca n't really tell . 
  it 's a niche sport that is n't covered at all by newspapers/tv news , ect . 
  the superbowl is usually covered , but only because of the ads and song acts , hardly any news coverage mentions who plays against who or anything about the actual game . 
  it also takes place in the middle of the night . 
  having said that , i do know some hardcore fans who watch every game of the [ vienna vikings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vikings_vienna ) , who are apparently a quite successful team . 
  i guess you mean [ eurail ] ( http://www.eurail.com/en ) ( for non-european citizans ) or [ interrail ] ( http://www.interrail.eu/en/interrail-passes ) ( only for european citizans ) both can be a good deal , but you should compare prices , often it 's cheaper to buy tickets seperately or use busses . 
  edit : and be aware that with this tickets , you often have to pay additional mandetory reservation fees for high speed trains and night trains , especially in france ( tgv ) and belgium/netherlands ( thalys ) . 
  which countries/cities do you plan to visit ? 
  maybe we could help you more, 
  yes , i can vote in austria and germany and usually do . 
  it 's usually some kind of fake modesty you pretend you do n't want to take the last piece , so you ask around if noone wants it ? 
  really noone ? 
  really ?? 
  are you sure ??? 
  ok , then i 'd take it , if it 's ok ? 
  really ok ?? 
  ok then i eat it . 
  usually noone would dare to say `` hey , i really want that !, 
  '' , so you know the outcome, 
  i 've never heard of those stores , so i 'm not sure if i understood this questions , but i guess , in germany hornbach and bauhaus would be similar ? 
  you can buy paint , costum sized , and standard pieces for all kinds of stuff ( including kitchen , bathrooms , plants , ... ) , ect, 
  yes , especially new york , las vegas , los angeles and florida , but mainly not for relaxing , but for sightseeing and visiting all those places you 've seen in blockbuster movies / tv series . 
  it 's quite expensive , but not something a middle class person ca n't affort ( but not your usual family vacation trip ) . 
  you can get quite good deals if you book early or use special offers of travel agencies . 
  ( when i booked flights for me and friends a few years ago , we payed around 280 euros per person for each direction , so 600 euros per person just for flights , which would be super expensive to book for a family of 5 , but not that hard for a single person with some savings ), 
  oh god , why did you remind me of that song ?? 
  i finally have n't heard it for several years . 
  christoph & lollo edit : yes , yes austria [ has ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6muwrzaygu ) a [ lot ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvikz8oe_xa ) of [ great ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrel_68o-mw ) . 
  [ bands ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwgistpkcdk ) , and [ songs ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tiv2k6rulc8 ) and [ singer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agvvbgtf-eg ) and [ artists ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksxtxynxibs ) ... but i love their concerts and i stay with the band i 've choosen :p, 
  most shops and supermarkets will be closed on sunday - in salzburg there is a big supermarket inside the trainstation thats open on sundays and until late at night every day . 
  tipping in restaurants is expected but not like in the us . 
  waiters get paid a living wage ( but not much more than minimum wage ) . 
  if you were happy with the service , tip around 5-10 % by rounding up to a convenient number ( like if it 's 13.50 $ , pay 14 $ or 15 $ ) always give the tip directly to the waiter , do n't leave it at the table . 
  there are no free refills of beverage in restaurants . 
  in touristy places there can be pickpockets , so keep your passport , credit card , ect somewhere safe . 
  upload the pictures you take to some online cloud storage every evening via wifi in your hotel - so if your camera or smartphone gets lost/stolen , you do n't lose all the beautiful pictures you took . 
  make copies of your passport , maybe scan it and email it to yourself , just in case it gets lost ( unlikely , but if it happens , it would make things much easier ) . 
  do n't put all your cash and credit card in one place , distribute it between your luggage . 
  from my personal observations : most people do n't have much interaction with black people on a personal level . 
  for example , i never went to school with any black kids - several from asia , middle eastern , balkan , ect , but noone what americans would call black . 
  this is changing at the moment . 
  the most personal interaction that a lot of people i know had would be the drug dealers standing around u6 subway stations , and refugees at our church . 
  what needs to change is that black people are seen as a part of normal life . 
  people need more interactions with black people in everyday life , and it will take some time until stereotypes changes . 
  i 'm talking about general stereotypes , not about how individual people are treated . 
  as soon as people see someone is a tourists / students/neighbour , most people will treat them just as if they were white . 
  black american tourists do n't fit into the stereotype and therefore will have to deal with typical `` american tourist '' - stereotypes instead . 
  i also do n't live in vienna anymore and only go there to visit every few month , so i 'm not the best source . 
  there has been a huge very visible increase of drug dealers near my parents home ( people standing around , asking everyone if they want to buy weed , having gang conflicts between them ) . 
  the police basicly managed to shut it down by racial profiling all black people nearby ( which i 'm not supporting ) . 
  i think the main reason why people here claim everyone treats black americans just like other americans is because it means you know they are from the us , and that makes skin colour irrelevant for a lot of `` scared '' ~ ~ people ~ ~ idiots the question would be answered differently if it was `` how are black people viewed in your country . '', 
  because for that , even in my quite intellectual circles of friends and family , the typical ( not said out loud ) stereotype is drug dealer from sub-sahara africa , speaking no german and broken english . 
  to be fair , for a lot of people , that 's the only real live interaction they have with black people ; being asked if you want to buy weed at subway stations in broken english . 
  i 'm so glad i never had to read it in school ( although i choose it for some kind of reading list for matura ) . 
  there were several books that i hated during school and now really like , because it 's just different if you are forced to read stuff and write tests about it . 
  haha , i thought it 's a stupid stereotype ; so i was really irritated when i visited spain for the first time and my first stop was sevilla ... during the seville fair in april , without knowing there is a festival going on ... 
  so many beautiful ladies in flamenco style dresses everywhere , in everyday situations like it 's normal ; at the train station , the bus stop , walking around , sitting in restaurants ... took me a few hours to understand what 's going on and that i should n't spend the evening in my hostel . 
  so true . 
  my cousin from nothern germany could n't understand why i do n't go snowboarding in the alps ever other weekend . 
  i mean , you can go snowboarding around vienna in the winter , but well , it does n't compare at all to what you 've seen on your winter holiday in tirol ( edit : tyrol ) . 
  most austrians do n't live close to mountains like that , and it 's a lot closer now that i live in munich ( which is n't as close to the alps as well as some people think ), 
  harry potter the physician across the nightingale floor / tales of the otori - saga a song of ice and fire lord of the rings der richter und sein henker ( the judge and his hangman ) die br\u00fccke ( [ the bridge ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_br%c3%bccke_ ( novel ) ), 
  definitely go up to the castle !, 
  i 'm not sure how far you will get if you only have a few hours in total , but the view gets more and more breathtaking the higher up you go !, 
  bring a waterbottle and something to eat , there is no restaurant up there . 
  c ) why ? 
  typing english on a [ german keyboard ] ( http://clasfaculty.ucdenver.edu/tphillips/germankeyboardlayout.html ) is no problem at all , english has no special characters . 
  what is painful in general is typing on a keyboard with any layout you are not used to , especially when it lacks characters you need ( like \u00e4 \u00f6 \u00fc ) . 
  can be hard when you are abroad and want to login somewhere with a username or password that uses special characters and you ca n't find them on the keyboard . 
  kotor was the highlight of my trip !, 
  and i got really scared on some of your [ roads ] ( http://www.dangerousroads.org/images/stories/newroads1001/01kotor.jpg ) . 
  very nice people and beautiful landscape, 
  my grandparents from one side of the family both grew up in poland and were forced to give up everything and move to germany after the war . 
  they moved to a very small village in northern germany , married there and were completely accepted by the locals . 
  my grandfather even was a quite well liked politician in this small town and the whole village attended each of their funerals .
