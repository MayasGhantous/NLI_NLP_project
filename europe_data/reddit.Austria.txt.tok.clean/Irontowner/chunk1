makes sense . 
  maybe i should just sit down and study the rules instead of trying to pick them up from tv .

  austria ( then austria-hungary ) lost a lot of territory in wwi . 
  most of these losses are seen as `` just '' ( since czechs , hungarians , slovaks , etc. 
  obviously deserve their own countries ) . 
  the only one seen as unjust is [ south tyrol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_tyrol ) because mostly german speakers lived there . 
  ( italy later encouraged italians to settle there so it 's now split between italians and austrians ) . 
  it was a political issue until the 1970s ( including bomb attacks and assassinations ) when austria and italy agreed on a status of autonomy for the region . 
  as far as i can tell , most people are happy with the current arrangement , although many austrians might still secretly think it 's `` ours '' . 
   while on even-numbered years , it paid a tribute of approximately $ 12 to the spanish bishop , plus six hams , six cheeses , and six live chickens . 
  this medieval custom was subsequently abandoned in 1993 . 
  they so should have kept this custom , maybe with some additional eu-regulation about the consistency of the cheese and the age of the chickens . 
  that ceremony when they deliver the chickens and the food to the spanish bishop would have made for some great tv . 
  1 ) in austria , that 's complete bullshit . 
  you can go anywhere in the country/city as a normal civilian , let alone as police . 
  2 ) neither/nor . 
  in the beginning , refugees are a burden for the welfare state but eventually they find jobs and often do the menial labor that locals do n't want to do . 
  the kids they bring also help with our otherwise shrinking population . 
  3 )  importing people from a different culture and mentality will irreversibly change a country . 
  our countries/societies have changed a lot in the last 70 years . 
  we went from a fascist dictatorship to a democracy , from a patriarchy to equal rights for women , from conservative catholicism to liberal non-religiousness , and now we even have ( almost ) equal rights for gay people . 
  not a single one of these changes had anything to do immigrants - it all came from within our own societies . 
   if europe takes in all syrian refugees , the population change will just be a drop in the bucket correct , although the syrians are n't equally distributed over all of europe but mainly went to 3 countries . 
  either way , birth rates among immigrants usually drop to the levels of the native population within two generations , so they 're not becoming the majority anytime soon . 
  here 's obama [ giving a speech in berlin ] ( https://imgur.com/a/uz4io ) in 2008 when he was n't even president yet . 
  so yes , obamania was definitely a thing in europe just like in the us . 
  it even lasted long enough for the nobel people to give him the nobel peace prize in 2009 ( basically for not being george bush  ) . 
  years later , some people were disappointed of some of his policies but he remains very popular to this day . 
  ( speaking for germany and austria ) . 
  i guess the reason why you see less artwork is that people are more motivated to satirize/fight against someone than to celebrate someone . 
  i 'm sure it 's similar in the us . 
  my brand of cigarettes are $ 4.60 in austria and $ 3.50 in hungary . 
  having a few drinks at a cafe or going to a restaurant in hungary would cost * roughly * half of what it costs in austria . 
  hope that helps a little . 
  no , not that i 'm aware of . 
  generally , drugs are more regulated here than in the us . 
  there 's no ads for drugs on tv and potentially dangerous drugs are n't prescribed as easily . 
  there 's a debate starting now that doctors prescribe too many antibiotics but the problem is n't with addiction or anything but with bacteria becoming more resistant to them . 
  afaik it 's a worldwide issue , though , albeit to varying degrees . 
  r/germany is probably the best place to ask this . 
  r/de and r/berlin might also be useful . 
  i think miami and florida in general are seen very positively . 
  beaches , party , tropical climate , etc. 
  i think after california and nyc it 's the third most popular destination to visit in the us , so pretty good . 
  personally , i love the art deco architecture . 
  [ franz kafka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_kafka ) ( writer ) : austria & czechia [ romy schneider ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romy_schneider ) ( actress ) : austria & germany [ matthias steiner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthias_steiner ) ( olympic gold medalist weightlifting ) : austria & germany [ adolf hitler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adolf_hitler ) ( nazi leader , mass murderer , etc. 
  ) : austria & germany i do n't think nationalists care too much about this stuff , though . 
  it 's more of an academic discussion or maybe national vanity . 
  we do n't really fight over these - and certainly not over hitler . 
   i 've also heard people claim that mozart was german but we definitely consider him austrian . 
   maybe in the 60s ? 
  agreed . 
  like in many other countries the `` hippie-movement '' changed a lot of things in austria . 
  people of that generation are still called 68-ers ( referring to 1968 ) and it means leftist , revolutionary , long hair , anti-authoritarian , etc. 
  '' * * ( if you sleep with the same girl twice , you 're already part of the establishment . 
  best : do n't need a navy . 
  very few shark attacks . 
  worst : i 'm not sure but maybe it 's a disadvantage in international trade ... 
  there 's also / r/acteuropa and / r/europeanfederalists you could look at . 
  i 'm not exactly sure what those subs are about but they sound like it 's something pro-eu and activism . 
  definitely try asking in r/germany and r/de . 
  r/de is technically a german language sub but it 's perfectly ok to post in english . 
  the crowd there is very pro-eu and some people are politically active so they should be able to point you in some useful direction . 
  good luck !, 
  to be honest , atm i 'd be happy if the eu does n't significantly deteriorate in the next decades . 
  if i 'm optimistic , though , i hope we 'll have a european army by then and something like a foreign minister so we speak with one voice in world affairs . 
  i 'm still not 100 % sold on worldwide free trade so i hope we do n't make to many agreements in that regard . 
  i think we 'd lose to much sovereignty if we open our markets for anything and anyone . 
  and maybe most important of all , i hope we have found a solution to dealing with migration . 
  i think this will become an even more pressing issue in the future ( climate change ) so we need to know how to deal with it . 
  it 's the [ porsche ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/porsche_ ( familie \\ ) ) and [ piech ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_pi%c3%abch ) family . 
  they own large chunks of volkswagen . 
  according to [ this recent article ] ( http://oekastatic.orf.at/static/images/site/oeka/20170626/oest_reichste_oesterreicher_a.5624144.png ) they 're worth over $ 35 billion . 
  ( # 2 is the owner of red bull ) historically , it might have been the habsburgs but most of their assets were seized after wwi . 
  ladies and gents , we have a winner !, 
  was going to say the same about silicon valley . 
  also : canada 's immigration point system has been mentioned a lot lately . 
  anti-immigration voices sometimes praise australia 's policy of bringing migrants to an island . 
  the european country that is most often cited here is probably switzerland for its low taxes and direct democracy . 
  `` national days of mourning '' is [ staatstrauer ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/staatstrauer ) which occurs after tragic events . 
  it 's not a fixed day in the calendar . 
  it 's not a big topic here and i doubt many people would know many details about it . 
  we know lincoln and that it was about slavery but that 's about it . 
  yes , the possibility exists in austria but i think it 's extremely rare . 
  i ca n't think of an occurrence in my lifetime . 
  [ half-mast ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/half-mast ) on the other hand is more common . 
  ( coincidentally , the wikipedia article has pictures of the austrian parliament ) . 
  it 's done when former statesmen or other significant figures die . 
  maybe also in case of tragedies , similar to the one in portugal . 
  i 'd be surprised if the uk did n't have it , for example when a monarch passes . 
  edit : there were 4 national days of mourning in austria in 2004 when our president died in office . 
  well , the same calculation applies for germany , spain , netherlands and even czechia . 
  if you immigrate to a european country ( either from within or outside the eu ) as an ( unskilled ) worker you usually start at the bottom and have to work your way up . 
  i seriously doubt many americans would want to do that . 
  edit : hungary is `` selling '' residency permits if you buy $ 300k of government bonds . 
  that 's a much more realistic `` price '' for it but the average person in the us or worldwide ca n't afford that . 
  do you mean our governments should try to make money by selling visas for $ 20k to americans ? 
  if so , you are really underestimating the ( annual ) budgets of our countries .
