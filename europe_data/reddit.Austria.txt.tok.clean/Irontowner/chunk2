  $ 20k is nothing in a country 's budget . 
  let 's say we `` invite '' 10,000 americans : $ 200m is still not much in austria 's budget [ which is ~ $ 180,000 m ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_government_budget ) . 
  plus we 'd have 10,000 immigrants who do n't speak the language , need housing and probably expect well paying jobs . 
  would n't work ...

  ' * - george best [ source ] ( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/george_best ), 
  the 1970s were a good time for football in austria . 
  [ hans krankl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_krankl ) played for barcelona , won the european cup and was european top scorer . 
  he also scored the winning goal against [ germany in cordoba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria_v_west_germany_ ( 1978_fifa_world_cup \\ ) ) which made him a national hero for centuries to come . 
  [ herbert prohaska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herbert_prohaska ) played for inter mialn and as roma . 
  he was voted `` austrian player of the century '' a few years ago . 
  we had another good run in the 1990s . 
  [ toni polster ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toni_polster ) played in spain and germany and was among the top scorers in those leagues . 
  [ andi herzog ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/andi_herzog ) won the german championship with werder bremen as captain . 
  he now coaches the us national team under 23s . 
  current : [ david alaba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_alaba ) is playing for bayern munich and has won numerous german championships and cups and the champions league . 
  he 's by far the most expensive player in austrian history . 
  i do n't know much about her but that particular statement is extremely stupid and should never be uttered by a leading politician in a western democracy . 
  she might as well have said : '' if the rule of law gets in the way of fighting terrorism maybe we should get rid of it . '', 
  technically , she 's suggesting to give up everything that we stand for and imho it would be reason enough to call for her resignation . 
   i really have no clue why they called themselves socialists , maybe historical reasons , maybe just addepting to the us-use of the word . 
  no , it 's not the american meaning of the term . 
  `` socialist '' is/was quite widely used for center-left parties in europe . 
  the austrian sp\u00d6 used to be called `` socialist '' until he 1980s when they changed their name to social democratic . 
  i think it was the normal term in many countries and some changed them , some did n't . 
  well , there are stats about where people came from who applied for asylum in europe in the last few years . 
  iirc it was somewhere along the lines of 40 % syrians , 30 % iraqi and 30 % `` other '' , which included afghans , north africans , even people from pakistan and bangladesh . 
  the longer the refugee `` influx '' in 2015 lasted , the more the numbers shifted towards `` other '' . 
  it 's also true that some migrants throw away their documents before arrival and then claim to be from syria . 
  the authorities work with translators who can tell where in the arab world someone is from based on accents/dialects . 
  they also double check the information they are given , such as addresses , employers address , names , etc. 
  so it does n't really matter whether `` people '' can tell the difference , but the authorities can . 
  once you are processed , you get a document to use in europe that states your nationality . 
  i checked a few dictionaries and wikipedia and that sounds about right . 
  i see . 
  i think here it 's more common for the person who wants to have privacy to leave the room . 
   that players are always racially abused in multiple ** always ** is definitely wrong . 
  in fact , when it happens it usually makes the news and clubs are punished for it . 
  whenever adults want to have a conversation , they send their kids to `` go out and play '' . 
  i do n't remember that ever happening during my own childhood . 
   do you believe in gravity ? 
  well , yesterday i tripped but did n't fall . 
  how do you explain that ? 
  no , the us should n't leave nato , but what you 're describing is pretty much what we have now . 
  a ) nobody in nato is forced to join `` american adventurism '' . 
  nato is defense only , and the only time article 5 was ever triggered was 9/11 . 
  nato members did n't ( have to ) join the us in vietnam , or gulf i , or iraq 2003 . 
  remember , rumsfeld 's / cheney 's `` coalition of the willing '' ( iirc ) was not all of nato . 
  germany famously refused to take part in the iraq war , and so did other nato members . 
  b ) article 5 is often misinterpreted in the public . 
  yes , it states that in case of an attack , nato members `` will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith , individually and in concert with the other parties , such action as it deems necessary , including the use of armed force , to restore and maintain the security of the north atlantic area . '', 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/north_atlantic_treaty#article_5 ) it does n't specify how much support there has to be . 
  you could literally comply with article 5 buy sending one rifle and 20 bullets to the attacked country , thereby providing assistance . 
  we do n't do much in austria and do n't have a memorial day . 
  we were on the wrong side of history in our last two wars , so it 's difficult to `` honor '' soldiers without `` celebrating '' what they fought for . 
  there are small memorials in every town though that list the names of fallen soldiers . 
  i think the day people would light candles there is typically all saints day . 
  good question . 
  my goal in life is to move to a warmer climate , so something southern would be nice . 
  and yes , red or blue would play a role in my decision . 
  if i combine those two conditions , i guess southern california it is . 
   if i did n't have to work , i 'd be up north in summer and down south in winter , like many retirees do it . 
  right , the jacket definitely distracts from the dress . 
  i think [ dirdnls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dirndl ) look pretty cool , especially [ on the right girl ] ( http://old.dirndl.com/bilder/n/xl/_mg_8889.jpg ) there 's a whole sub devoted to them : / r/dirndls, 
  always have enough cash with you . 
  i do n't know about switzerland but compared to the us , austria is a credit card wasteland . 
  very few places accept them - cash is king . 
  if you maybe/probably/sometimes need specific medications/anything you 'd buy in a drugstore , bring enough of it with you from the us . 
  buying drugs abroad can be a pain because names and regulations are different and the same stuff you can get over the counter in the us might need a prescription here . 
  just to clarify : the german word `` neger '' is the equivalent of american `` negro '' which was a common word for `` black '' until the 60s ( ? ) . 
  we do n't have an equivalent of `` nigger '' . 
  in austria , the options are usually ketchup and mayonnaise . 
  i usually take ketchup . 
  [ stg 77 ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hizynsc.jpg ) ( sturmgewehr/assault rifle 77 ) [ steyr aug ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steyr_aug ) . 
  i was n't in the army and have never shot one , so i do n't have an opinion about it . 
  here are [ some examples ] ( https://imgur.com/a/ewaan ) from burgenland . 
  i agree that there were no issues in burgenland . 
  short answer : your best stuff is ( much ) better than our best stuff . 
  your worst stuff is ( much ) worse than our worst stuff . 
  longer answer : austrian or german tv series can in no way compete with stuff like got , walking dead , breaking bad , etc. 
  we lack the money , the writers , the actors - everything . 
  our market is too small to support a large industry , and with all the american shows up and ready for our tv stations to buy , an industry will never develop - simple as that . 
  we have fewer channels , though as in the us , and anything that is n't high quality scripted tv is probably better here . 
  the news are definitely more in depth than any cable or network news in the us . 
  our public broadcasters still have major news departments with offices and correspondents all around the world , since `` news and information '' is one of their main mandates by law . 
  imho documentaries are also better here . 
  i would rank austrian and german original documentaries ( history , nature , etc ) above american ( history , discovery , natgeo ) and maybe slightly below the bbc ( definitely the nature stuff , history maybe equal ) in terms of quality . 
  we do n't have propaganda disguised as news coughfoxnewscough , which is a good thing . 
   sports i would say the quality is similar here and in the us , although you are probably 5-10 years ahead of us when it comes to new technology like hd or 4k or whatever . 
  the biggest tv sports here are soccer , skiing and formula 1 . 
  we have much less commercials , which makes watching tv generally a nicer experience here , imo . 
  [ age of consent in france is 15 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_europe#france ) , so there is no problem with it . 
  i very much agree . 
  if people are starving in the street , they will simply start robbing people or stealing from supermarkets . 
  worst case for them : they get caught and go to prison , where they at least get food . 
  human survival instinct , and you ca n't even blame them for it . 
  it was faroe islands ' first non-friendly international game . 
  they were all amateurs , while austria had played in the world cup in italy a few months earlier . 
  the game has its own [ wikipedia entry ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/fu%c3%9fballl%c3%a4nderspiel_f%c3%a4r%c3%b6er_%e2%80%93_%c3%96sterreich_1990 ) ( in german ) .
