i thought that 's the europe subreddit ? 
  other continents have their own problems , we ( as europeans ) share pretty much the same shit that 's going on in the us . 
  and that 's clearly a lack of education , empathy and humanity . 
  that 's the most racist thing i 've read for a long time . 
  probably you just give too much of a shit about other people to see that . 
  i wish you good loot and stable connect ), 
  so you 're in favor of a racist and sexist lifestyle ? 
  i do n't think this is something we should tolerate , but hey , i 'm probably too well educated to grasp that thought . 
   it 's mostly the white working-poor class , they 've been marginalized for years , now they 've been mobilized . 
  by a friggin billionaire ?!, 
  how can such a person be the hero of those people ? 
  by making bold promises he most certainly ca n't keep ? 
  sometimes it feels hard to not think that the white working-poor class consists purely of illiterates . 
  erdogan makes goats butthurt :(, 
  ! remindme 1.1.2020 $ : funny you 're talking about the big boys ... while we still have 445 million inhabitants , uk 's 65 look pretty laughable compared . 
  who 's the big boy now ? 
  this was because people shat their pants during the high tides of the european migrant crisis . 
  right parties are significantly dropping in voter 's favor again in austria ( and [ germany too ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000055454142/streit-frust-themenflaute-afd-im-sinkflug ) ) now that the number of immigrants has significantly dropped . 
  right perties simply do n't have anything meaningful to give - they just play with fear and nationalism . 
  hofer failed in austria , wilders failed in the nl and it 's pretty save to say that le pen will fail in fra too . 
  optimism is what needs to be the flavor of the month again - this makes people so much more creative and productive !, 
   significantly more so than austria now you need private lessons in statistics too ? 
  you do know the difference between relative and absolute contribution , right ? 
   however when you start calling the british `` ungrateful cherry pickers '' that 's where i draw the line . 
  you 're not even doing it hard for me ... ever heard of the infamous , highly cherry-picky [ uk rebate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uk_rebate ) ? 
  and i believe now that the uk is history in our lovely avangers team , i bet there are many more situations to come where to pick cherries during negotiations ... but i hope those times are gone now . 
  i think your brain is so fucked up and full of fear and hatred , that it consumes you . 
  dude , chill ... we are the most furtunate people in the world to live in the greatest and wealthiest place in the world . 
  the eu will remain to be the greatest peace project this planet has ever seen . 
  have you checked what [ research areas the ceu is offering ] ( http://www.ceu.edu/research/areas ) ? 
  there is no `` studies on how to stifle free speech '' or `` jewish conspiracy 101 '' ... good luck developing hate propaganda in human rights law , sustainable development , environmental studies , medieval studies or mathematics . 
   at what expense , the subtle brainwashing of their institutional professionals ? 
  i 'm a phd student and i can assure you , people in academia are perfectly capable of fostering their own thoughts . 
  [ vienna offered to host the central european university in case of shutdown due to moronic decisions made in hungary ] ( https://kurier.at/politik/ausland/vassilakou-bietet-soros-uni-quartier-in-wien-an/256.085.831 ), 
  i repeat myself : yes we need the eu , yes we love the eu . 
  and yes , we acknowledge that we are stronger together ... no need to remain small if we have such amazing friends to be together with !, 
   because you 're a small weak country so basically what the uk is going to be soon ? 
  :( yes we need the eu , yes we love the eu ... good luck in finding your luck on the global market on your own lol, 
  go away , we do n't even want to talk to you anymore . 
  i jused look through some of the lyrics of different national anthems . 
  i really liked the norwegian one , this could easily be used in any viking saga :  farmers their axes sharpened  wherever an army advanced ,  tordenskjold along the coastline thundered  so that we could see it back home . 
   even women stood up and fought  as if they were men ;  others could only cry  but that soon would end !, 
  meanwhile , the austrian anthem made an attempt to gender-neutrality . 
  since 2012 the line `` heimat bist du gro\u00dfer s\u00f6hne '' ( `` thou art home to great sons '' ) was replaced by ( metrically not fitting ) `` heimat gro\u00dfer t\u00f6chter und s\u00f6hne '' . 
  ( `` thou art home to great ** daughters ** and sons '' ) . 
  so by shoehorning something into the lyrics that does n't fit into the vocal melody at all , austria is the first country in the world to make its anthem gender-neutral . 
  i always read norwegian with an activated viking voice ... sounds strange , but epic !, 
  yeah , so great , kosovo did n't even bother making their own . 
  or it 's just another n/a and ` europe ' on the map stands as a placeholder . 
  austrian here : because fuck those ungrateful cherry-pickers , that 's why . 
  i counted them ... twice . 
  i call bs !, 
  * amazing,

  `` ast\u00e9rix et la transitalique '' ... for all that do not speak french : `` asterix and the transsexual italian '', 
  we should pay less taxes to adopt the system that germany now introduced . 
  except , that austrians pay even higher taxes plus road charges ? 
  get your facts right please . 
   maintaining roads in the mountains is more expenssive . 
  ok , seems you ran out of arguments ... i work in the field of natural hazards and i can tell you : our motorways are safe and secure and not located on any mountain passes . 
  also you pay road charges only for motorways in austria , not for the mountain passes that * maybe * require a bit more maintanance . 
  but whatever . 
  [ this is totally wrong ... lol ] ( https://auto-motor.at/auto/neuwagen/neuwagen-archiv/kfz-steuer-deutschland-oesterreich.html ), 
  is this so difficult to comprehend ? 
  * in austria , austrians pay road charges , germans pay them , everyone pays them . 
  period . 
  * now in germany , austrians pay them , everyone pays them , germans pay them too at first but as a substitute they pay now a reduced motor vehicle tax , which makes only foreigners pay for the road charges . 
  dude . . austrians have to pay those road charges in austria too !, 
  now with the road charges in germany , germans receive that money back , making only foreign road users pay for it . 
  you still do n't get it ? 
  ask the germans , they are master experts in this ... last week they finally introduced road charges for foreigners . 
  this is particularly fucked up , as the shortest way from eastern austria to western austria is through germany . 
  if you want her to turn into lordi , then go ahead . 
  imho this is thanks to the moronic tax regulations that draw large concerns not requiring them to pay taxes in the eu, 
  [ chad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chad ) is not even on the map , duuuuude ...

  nah ... not even rpg 's come with a decent booklet anymore these days :(,

  at least you wo n't join is . 
  you 're doing the lord 's work . 
  hail to thee, 
  nice ... wo n't ever happen between austria and germany though . 
  go away speakers of the ugly german !, 
  my ex-gf 's heart is as cold as helsinki in winter :-(, 
  listen closely to the train announcement : belvedere , not belveder ( and you do speak the last e compared to the french pronounciation ) .
