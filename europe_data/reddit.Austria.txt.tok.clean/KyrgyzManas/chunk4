  varies from state to state or even county to county . 
  the number of schools teaching creationism is alarmingly high ... do some google research . 
  in europe this is unimaginable . 
  to be fair , the usa and south korea are teaching creationism too . 
  we are n't communists !, 
  we may be liars , pigs , idiots , communists , but we are * not * porn stars !, 
  what about ostmark ? 
  aaah our good , old hammer & sickle ... friendship , comrades !, 
  the floor is lava already !, 
  geomorphologist here : this is very likely an [ esker/os ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/esker ) ( some sedimentary remnants of the fennoscandian ice sheet during the last weichselian glaciation ), 
   i 'm pretty sure germans and austrians will have no trouble communicating . 
  i think you have no idea how fucked up people in the western barbaric parts of austria speak . 
  i , as a guy from vienna , ca n't understand people from the westernmost part ( vorarlberg ) at all when they speak with their native dialect . 
  same applies to some tyrolean dialects . 
  my gf is from central austria and even there i had problems at first understanding many of the words her parents use in their everyday 's life ( wtf is drawig , feigid , gfickert , brechad , ... ), 
  and once again scotland is the best part of that soon-to-be unimportant island in the atlantic ocean !, 
  the closer you get to austria , the better things get , even the people . 
   i find sebastian kurz to be very realistic in this regard . 
  people might think that from the outside , but now that he took over the conservative party a month ago and caused re-elections in october , people seem to realize he 's just an uneducated dumbass with dumbo-like ears . 
  he 's a back-stabber par excellence . 
  $ dit : also people think that it 's easy to close a migration route through the sea ... ask greece and how they were unable to stop people from migrating over sea and how important turkey was ( unfortunately ) to stop the migration flow into the balkans when merkel set up that shady treaty with them . 
  lol . 
  i pay $ 9,99 for 2000 minutes and sms + 4 gb lte just across the border ( austria ) . 
  in austria ( and the netherlands ) i think this is already the case for some publishers ( [ springer for example ] ( https://scilog.fwf.ac.at/en/article/2835/open-access-publishing-at-springer ) ) . 
  i got a paper accepted recently and directy got the notification on that i am eligible for open access publication without any further ado . 
  now it 's published under open access licence as it should be because we were all funded by public money . 
  i was in madrid 5 years ago and i have to say this was one of the most disappointing cities i 've been to in europe :( adjacent [ toledo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/toledo_skyline_panorama%2c_spain_-_dec_2006.jpg ) on the other hand ... man , this was one of the greatest cities i 've been to for a long time !, 
  * macadamia * mamamia * macedonalds * malaria but a decision is still pending . 
  nanananananana batman !, 
  what a bunch of ` bloody cunts ' ... 
  `` world cities '' -  reykjavik turns into arkhangelsk, 
  yeah it 's surprising that the austrian chancellor has a football attached to his foot and not a ski ... i 'm totally with you . 
  i think you have never watched a good porn movie . 
  but the food is delicious at least !, 
  mother of dragons too ? 
  `` happy genocide folks ! '', 
  ... other half is ridiculously hot !, 
  it 's basically heaven and hell over there . 
  i am always baffled seeing german as such an important language in eastern european school systems . 
  why not french or spanish ? 
  those languages are spoken by far more people around the globe . 
  [ kazakhstan prepares to ditch cyrillic for a latin-based alphabet by 2025 ] ( http://www.eurasianet.org/node/83206 ) ( article from last week ), 
   also estonia has a small ingrian finn minority , many of whom immigrated to finland in the 90s . 
  for alcohol reasons i guess ? 
  i will never forget when i took a ferry from helsinki to tallin where most of the finnish people headed over with huge empty suitcases . 
  on our way back to hel , those were full of booze lol, 
  but this is not what you usually observe in large cities ... not in the us after the last presidential elections , not in the uk after the brexit shizzle , not in austria after the last presidential elections nor in any other western country i can remember in the past elections . 
  usually the larger cities have a significantly higher share of well educated , young liberals that tend to vote against protectionist , nationalist and conservatist directions . 
  in the case of istanbul it just means imho , that there is a farily large amount of morons regardless of their education . 
  plus half the opposition was probably imprisoned too lol, 
  good , you should have made that more clear from the get-go . 
  try to work on that . 
  still i do n't agree . 
  nice ... finally a country that wants to be frands with us ;-( love you too cz - i 'm going to a czech city close to our border once a year for beer and food just to get to know some of our border cities . 
  especially enjoyed znojmo and cesky krumlov !, 
  man those meat filled potato pancake ( bramborak ? ), 
  are awesome ... 
  you said there is mafia-like corruption in greece , but only `` minor '' everyday 's corruption in the east . 
  that implies that there is no mafia-like big style corruption in the east , which is false . 
  if you think there is n't mafia-like political corruption in bg or rom ( for example ) , you 're very wrong . 
  look up [ cohesion policy ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/faq/ ) ... one of the greatest things the eu has ever invented . 
  ireland gladly bends over to big multinational companies by offering tax presents that let their economy flourish . 
  smart !, 
  morally questionable , but smart !, 
   with a troublesome geography that makes infrastructure rather expensive that 's a terrible explanation ... look at the alpine regions that need a brazilion of tunnels and pass roads . 
  most of those differences are explainable with some historic context : eastern europe was communistic for a long time , the balkans had a really nasty war going on based on ethnical conflicts ( that still remain today ) . 
  all of them have in common ( together with greece ) that corruption is really blatant and culturally anchored . 
  western europe did n't have those problems and could prosper ever since ww2 . 
  at least you have a second major center in cz ( brno ) . 
  i do n't know why austria is so stupid and focusses everything on vienna ... it 's getting bigger at a really dramatic rate . 
  estimates say in 10 years vienna 's going to have 2 million inhabitants , while the second largest city ( graz ) merely has 290k ` ish . 
  i always admire how polycentric switzerland is . 
  bratislava airport is a ryanair hub because they do n't want to pay the airport fees in vienna . 
  there are cheap af bus transfers from vienna to get there ( takes ~ 1h ) . 
  other than that , there 's not much going on at the bratislava airport . 
  it does . 
  media is stupid af , people are ugly alcoholoics , the food served in gb i would n't even want my cat to eat , most of the cities are boring as hell , there are no mountains to ski and the best parts of gb are n't england . 
  that 's how we perceive gb . 
  oh and brexit ofc ... does n't look too good for you . 
  til that from ukraine to kazakhstan it is shorter than from vienna to zurich .

  i wish you loot and stable connect , comrade ), 
  i was in laos this summer and met quite a few brits ... a lot of them were apologizing for brexit . 
  that 's just legit , but i forgeve them as most of them were nice people . 
  not , if you 're a liberal democrate . 
  otherwise i heard england is nice too in summer . 
  no , you lost your funny parts after ww2 !, 
  we do n't need friends the second we agree on turning into the united states of europe . 
  that 's by biggest dream . 
  fuck all , eu all the way !, 
  that we are all descendants from the trapp family . 
  really ... literally noone in austria has ever seen ` the sound of music ' , yet we are constantly mocked with that . 
  seems to be a us thing . 
  ( funny thing : in salzburg where this movie was made apparently , there are tours to the filming locations ... they are n't even offered in german because there is simply no demand , but in all other possible languages ) . 
   but something not being true = / = not understanding why it 's associated with a country in particular . 
  because czech girls ( but also eastern european girls in general ) are considered as extremely beautiful here in europe . 
  that 's why there are so many ... educational videos with their respective nationality ( `` czech '' , `` russian '' , `` ukrainian '' ) . 
  if people from the us would know about `` belarus '' , `` latvian '' , ... , those would probably also make an appearance on said ... documentary channels .
