do n't think so . 
  but deaths by terrorism are much lower than a couple centuries ago anyway . 
  though the last two years were pretty bad again . 
  [ http://www.datagraver.com/case/people-killed-by-terrorism-per-year-in-western-europe-1970-2015] ( http://www.datagraver.com/case/people-killed-by-terrorism-per-year-in-western-europe-1970-2015 ), 
  that 's because norway is in the eea and thus in schengen, 
   because it 's done behind closed doors so like every other international negotiation ? 
  in fact ttip is the most transparent international negotiation ever . 
  the eu published every paper which showed their position , which is all they are allowed to publish without approvel of us negotiators . 
  also it is not like it will be passed a day after negotiations are finished ... 
  it will lie around for a year or two and absolutly everyone will be able to download and read it . 
  knowing the eu i 'd guess it will also be available in various languages . 
  then the parliament and council will vote for it , which we all elected to represent us . 
  if you do n't like ttip , you can campaign against it in that time ...  because it pushes for some provisions that are against european cultural sensitivities cecilia malmstr\u00f6m repeatedly stated that she wo n't allow that any eu standards will be lowered . 
  ignoring these statements would be political suicide and damage the eu massively . 
  alone for that reason i ca n't possibly imagine that she will do that . 
  besides that , there is no sign yet that this will even happen . 
  it could be also possible that in the end , both the eu and us end up with higher standards because we adopt higher standards from each other . 
   blanket isds provisions there are already over 1400 such agreements within the eu and on an international level , including with russia and china . 
  also these agreements do n't enable companies to sue governments because they do n't like a new law . 
  this only applies on discrimination . 
  so foreign companies have to be treated like local companies . 
  e.g a government could n't say , companies from country xy has to pay higher taxes . 
  i also want to state that i 'm not particularly in favour of ttip . 
  i just think we should let them finish negotiatons and then look at it seriously . 
  maybe the outcome is good . 
  maybe its bad . 
  maybe there wo n't be an outcome . 
  it is also very important to say what we want and do n't want . 
  but to say we should just stop negotiations because us is evil is also a wrong move . 
  some sources for my statements : [ http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/balanced-eu-us-free-trade-agreement_en] ( http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/balanced-eu-us-free-trade-agreement_en ) [ especially this ( page 7 for isds ) ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2015/march/tradoc_153266.pdf ), 
  remember acta ? 
  the last government that had to accept it , was the eu , but because the parliament saw that there was a big public outrage , they ditched it . 
  i really don ' understand where this huge mistrust in our politicians comes from ... . 
   making it all peatonal except for residents and public transport so no one is allowed to drive there except residents and public transport ? 
  what differentiates the landstra\u00dfe in linz from most other pedestrian areas which are of course very common in europe , is that pedestrians and cars share the same road . 
  so anyone can drive through it and leave it on the other end or at one of the junctions that crosses the street . 
  in the other pedestrian areas i know of , most traffic is completely banned . 
  there are still constantly cars driving through it , but they drive slow and are n't to much so that pedestrians do n't have to really worry about them . 
  but still enough that it helps reducing the traffic on the streets around it , on which most people prefer driving . 
  that 's what i thought these superillas are supposed to be . 
  just on a larger scale and i do n't think it would work much worse . 
  though the only traffic engineering skills i have , i obtained from cities skyline , so i would n't count on them ... 
  we have something fairly similar here in linz , austria . 
  the so called `` landstra\u00dfe '' , though it is only one very long street , not a housing block like in the video . 
  a shopping mile leading from the train main station to the town square . 
  on both sides are huge side walks and in the middle a tram line on which cars are also allowed . 
  the thing is , driving there is so unattractive and annoying that people just do n't do it unless they absolutely have to because trams drive by every couple minutes and pedestrians are walking all over the place . 
  every couple weeks there are also some events on the street like street food festivals or something like that where food stalls stand on the border between side walks and street . 
  works really well . 
  [ what it looks like during christmas time ] ( http://www.linz.at/images/landstrasse_weihnacht_g.jpg ) [ during some food festival \\ ( i think \\ ) ] ( http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/ee8d17220b6e408ba38ba75954a7d5f9/landstrasse-street-with-ursulinenkirche-church-linz-upper-austria-dgpbmd.jpg ) [ when nothing special is going on ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=linz+landstra%c3%9fe&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjn-5wymkbrahxcyfakhwqobr4q_auicsgc&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950#imgrc=i8vubd7rt3r_am%3a ) [ another part ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=linz+landstra%c3%9fe&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjn-5wymkbrahxcyfakhwqobr4q_auicsgc&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950#imgrc=gzmb1ooxb-l3om%3a ) [ on google maps . 
  sadly no street view in austria ] ( https://www.google.at/maps/dir/hauptplatz,+4020+linz/goethekreuzung/@48.2988793,14.2916254,17z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x477397814344ee11:0x9a4d98da530777ed!2m2!1d14.285973!2d48.306566!1m5!1m1!1s0x47739790ddf31ea3:0x6f8f96aa85e72702!2m2!1d14.291928!2d48.296201!3e2?hl=de ), 
  welp , now at least we know you 're just some euro-sceptic criticizing the eu for things , lots of member states do much worse . 
  in austria for example , we have even less power over who becomes chancellor . 
  maybe at least someone learned something new about the eu and that in lots of cases , the commission and parliament are n't the ones blocking progress in the eu that people often demand . 
  then you did n't follow the last election ... 
  our politicians serve that purpose . 
  just standing there ... liveless ... doing nothing ... except taking up space edit : like in [ this photo ] ( https://images.derstandard.at/2017/05/29/1359a86d-e6d2-4234-8636-4c7ae540ba8d.jpg ), 
  about the highway toll ? 
  only found some articles on google stating that they plan to sue germany . 
   but now government wants to add a toll and the expectation is that germans should pay twice , with some tax and toll , i do n't know how the german government plans the funding of their autobahn in the future , but in austria , [ according to our ministry for infrastructure ] ( https://www.bmvit.gv.at/verkehr/gesamtverkehr/gvp/faktenblaetter/allgemein/fb_strasseninfrastruktur.pdf ) , no tax money is used for upkeeping our autobahn . 
  to build new ones , little to no tax money is used . 
   for roads they can only use once wat ?? 
  on top of that , i think most of these germans misunderstand austrias problem with the toll . 
  it is not the toll itself our government wants to fight , we have one ourself , but the tax return germans would get . 
  right now , german citizens would get the money they pay back through tax returns or something . 
  austrian government sees this as discrimination since only foreigners would have to pay . 
  so should austria suceed , it is quite possible , that germans really have to pay then . 
  :p though , maybe they hope german government will abolish the whole plan should austria suceed \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af,

   german country ** triggered *, 
  ah yes !, 
  viennese coffehouses are the best . 
  i love to sit there for hours and just read . 
  do n't even have to order something constantly . 
  get one coffee and one can sit there the whole day without anyone bothering you . 
  and who would n't want to spend a whole day in such a beautiful [ place ] ( http://viennasalsacongress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/central.jpg ) , 
  also gustav mahler who was born what then was austro-hungary and is now chzechia though i do n't know whether czechs claim him or not . 
   i 've also heard people claim that mozart was german but we definitely consider him austrian . 
  heard that too , even from germans and it is utterly ridiculous . 
  he was born in salzburg which was then its own state and is now part of austria . 
  never part of germany which did n't even exist at this time . 
  still there are germans who defend his `` german heritage '' . 
  why doskozil ? 
  only because he represents the refugee critical wing within the left wing sp\u00d6 ? 
  they desperately need him to not lose any more voters to the fp\u00d6 and if you disagree with him , that does n't make him a scumbag . 
  imo he is quite the opposite and the best minister for defense in a very long time . 
  before he came into office about a year ago , our military was a national shame which could n't even afford bullets for training and fuel for tanks . 
  now we are buying new tanks and stuff . 
  i do n't want austria to bei in the core of the eu . 
  i want it to be ** the ** core of the eu . 
  ^ ^ ` maniacal ^ ^ laugh '  :d, 
   the austrians would n't really have a problem with it , would they ? 
  i have never met anyone who would consider this , no matter the circumstances . 
  the opposite is actually the case . 
  wwii created a deep hatred of that idea and laid the foundation for austrian patriotism . 
  we always view ourselves better than germans and making jokes about them became a national sport . 
  this was a symptom of something like deep hatred , though younger people do n't mean it like this anymore . 
  lots of german exchange students report from abusive behaviour when they are in austria because of their nationality . 
  so no .
