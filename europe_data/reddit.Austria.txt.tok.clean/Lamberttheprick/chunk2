  i do n't think austria and germany could merge in the foreseeable future . 
  i think we would merge with hungary before that happens . 
  and they did so for hundreds of years . 
  because back then , in the 16th , 17th and 18th century there was no germany . 
  so the term `` german '' did n't refer to a nationality since there was no german nation . 
  it referred to a group of cultures or maybe even ethnicity . 
  everyone who spoke german was german . 
  also german speaking swiss viewed themselves as germans . 
  the name austria referred to the house of habsburg and not really to its people . 
  today german referres to a nationality . 
  this of course did not just stop because the german nation was created . 
  only after the second world war austrians wanted to dissociate from germans as much as they could . 
  we put ourselves in the role of the first nazi victim and the russians enabled us to create a sovereign nation again . 
  this was the start of todays austrian identity but i personally doubt lots of austrians viewed themselves as german nationality . 
  also , there was in fact sort of an austrian identity . 
  before the anschluss , `` austrofascism '' was on the rise which was very similiar to mussolinis italian fascism . 
  their leader was assasinated by nazis though . 
  [ check your facts duh !, 
  ] ( https://www.thelocal.at/20160707/escaped-kangaroo-evades-police-in-austria ), 
  for one , the austrian empire is a couple hundred years older than the german . 
  and even though we descend from germanics and celts like germany and btw also most other parts of europe , austrian territory was almost completely occupied by romans who also founded our major cities . 
  so our culture went in different directions quite early in modern human history . 
  sure , we speak the same language today and are historic allies . 
  but this probably goes back on the hre . 
  it 's the same with english , welsh , scots and irish . 
  just because they all speak english , they are n't all english . 
  as well as americans and australians . 
  we ruled over ourselves for over a thousend years . 
  fought our own wars and created our own culture . 
  so why should we consider ourselves german . 
  ** only austrians are allowed to point that out . 
  you just wait till we send little karl over to you with our hordes of kangaroos **, 
  ** what did you just say about my stupid fellow countrymen  :( **, 
  also , if global warming was n't true , it 's not like we would lose anything . 
  air pollution is still unhealthy . 
  people get ill from it and die . 
  fossil energy is also really bad for nature . 
  the great barrier reef for example is dying because of the coal industry and millions of animals died in the past because of oil leaks . 
  it 's a win-win situation . 
  i do n't get why people oppose this . 
   popper the open society was the first philosophical book i read . 
  few people had as much influence on me and my way of thinking as he did :(, 
   what is the second most popular ** team sport ** in your country would n't consider skiing or formua 1 a team sport . 
  since it would have been his 60th birthday this year , i started to listen [ falco ] ( https://youtu.be/cvikz8oe_xa ) again and i just ca n't get enough of it :o especially the falco symphonics concert where he was backed by an orchestra is symply amazing . 
  personal favorite is [ junge r\u00f6mer ] ( https://youtu.be/eu8lskaqm_0 ) . 
  austrian cauldron : would n't need any guard . 
  everyone would complain all day about the shitty cauldron but when it comes to actually doing something about it , like fleeing , everyone would be like `` meh . 
  is n't so bad here actually '', 
  i personally like the kunsthaus itself , it just does n't fit in its surrounding area . 
  a very modern and bizarre looking building and over the street , 10 meters away are some rather old , maybe even centuries old buildings . 
  they should have built it in the middle of a town square or something similiar . 
  it would look much better then . 
  linz in upper austria was until the late 20th century a very industry-heavy city without much culture , thus we do n't really have these old overwhelming buildings . 
  however , in the last couple decades the local government invested a lot of money in building one . 
  because of this , most of our [ museums ] ( https://www.aec.at/news/files/2016/08/b_center_01.jpg ) and [ music halls ] ( http://static2.bergfex.com/images/downsized/c8/cbb8c054a857e9c8_5ee83e2964d81efa.jpg ) have a very [ modern look ] ( https://austria-forum.org/attach/wissenssammlungen/bildlexikon_%c3%96sterreich/orte_in_ober%c3%b6sterreich/linz/lentos_museum_10/redakii_28163_1.jpg ) . 
  i personally like the [ musiktheater ] ( https://www.landestheater-linz.at/de/repos/files/lth/bilder/mt_galerie/00_aussenansicht_nacht.jpg?exp=70795 ) which was opened only two or three years ago , the most . 
  look from the [ side ] ( http://www.fassaden-blog.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/musiktheater_au%c3%9fen2-590x400.jpg ) the ugliest is probably the [ tnf tower ] ( http://www.linzwiki.at/w/images/thumb/a/a7/tnf-turm_wolfauerstra%c3%9fe_%282%29.jpg/300px-tnf-turm_wolfauerstra%c3%9fe_%282%29.jpg ) of our university , which btw . 
  is also only 50 years old . 
  the rest of the university looks much [ prettier ] ( http://linz-panorama.webfly.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/sciencepark20110703_4.jpg ) though . 
  you 're talking about [ interrail ] ( http://www.interrail.eu/en ) . 
  there are various types of tickets valid for either some or all eu countries . 
  the [ ars electronica festival ] ( https://www.aec.at/ai/en/ ) for art , technology and society will be held in september here in linz . 
  it 's one of my personal highlight events every year in austria . 
  every year it has a different technological or futuristic theme which will be presented in an artistic way all over the city . 
  one can just stroll through linz visiting different exhibitions , enjoy some concerts , watch some animated short movies or visit symposias and conferences to which artists and renown scientists are invited as speakers . 
  last year for example hiroshi ishii from the mit was the main speaker . 
  this years theme will be `` artificial intelligence '' . 
  highliy recommend it for people interested in technology  edit : also recommend the '' [ sommernachtskonzert ] ( http://www.sommernachtskonzert.at/index_en.html ) '' where the vienna philharmonics will play in front of schloss sch\u00f6nbrunn . 
  admission is free . 
  can we let them haul a boulder from london to brussels ? 
  i 'm not sure if it 's a particular dialect , but i love the sound of viennese talking standard german . 
  it sounds rather classy though still casual . 
  [ falco ] ( https://youtu.be/ycfbroji7qe?t=30s ) for example talked like this or this [ older guy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0biczvlmufy ) would be another example . 
  though not my language , i also adore the [ scottish dialect ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cenbkhs3mny ) . 
  it 's one of the major reasons i want to take an erasmus year in scotland . 
  hope it 'll still be possible in a few years :(, 
  god i ca n't possibly imagine a scotsman getting angry and yelling at me . 
  i think i would just burst out in laughter ... 
  it 's a holiday , i just woke up and now do n't want to get up . 
  i mean , i do n't have to since it 's a holiday but if i do n't , i 'll get the feeling to have wasted precious time i could have spent studying , playing one of my instruments or beating the hell out of these filthy ottomans in europa universalis ... 
  '' [ the festival of the chicken ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/das_fest_des_huhnes ) '' . 
  a group of african anthropologists travel to austrian countryside to research the customs of native austrians . 
  [ german version ] ( https://youtu.be/aszg4qdriog?t=1s ) is available on yt, 
   from hitler to erdogan ( not `` comparing '' ) , we 've seen time and again that checks and balances are not just worth the piece of paper they are written on . 
  each pursued a route to granting himself dictatorial powers within the pre-existing legal framework . 
  in erdogan 's case , the referendum . 
  in hitler 's case , the `` enabling act . '', 
  that 's not really a valid argument since the system works different in every country . 
  just because it does not work properly in turkey or in germany 70 years ago , does n't mean it wo n't work anywhere else . 
  that said it is of course possible to undermine the system and establish a dictatorship . 
  but it is much harder in modern `` western '' countries where democracy has a longer history and is much higher valued than in some other countries like turkey or also russia . 
  apart from that , what would be the alternative ? 
  that 's like saying `` check and balance is not working anyhow . 
  we 'll always end in a dictatorship so why bother fighting it '' . 
   in practice , checks and balances do n't count for much if they are not enforced but they are . 
  or else thousands of citizens from several countries in the middle east would not be allowed to enter the usa . 
  i have the feeling lots of people say checks and balance does n't work because trump became president or can push some laws they disagree with , which is utterly bullshit . 
  checks and balances are only supposed to prevent the president from going too far and for that more institutions are responsible than senate and congress . 
  does it literally say  etc. 
  etc. , ?
