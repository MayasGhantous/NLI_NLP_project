you would at least have to say '' * enjoy * trying another country '' according to the declaration . 
  i agree that improving more local help should be a priority . 
  most of those who are displaced never leave the region and - ignoring for a second any kind of moral obligation to help - it is in europe 's best interest to not have a generation or two of people without perspective and vulnerable to radicalization . 
  however , i have this vague feeling that , once europe ramps up its aid for that to turkey , jordan , etc. , those who are now crying `` we 're flooded with migrants , stop it '' will instantly start crying `` we 're flooding them with money , stop it '' . 
  from your mention of family reunifications i conclude that you intend that island to be the final destination for those who are granted asylum ? 
  ( so far i had thought you 'd only want people to stay there while their asylum applications are processed . ), 
  still : why would sorting on an island be cheaper then sorting in the eu ? 
  i have to admit that , ignoring the declaration of human rights due to ridiculousness , getting asylum is not actually a human right . 
  / s edit : apparently the / s is useful despite the obvious tautology ? 
  so `` renting big-ass land '' actually means `` just keep everyone the fuck out of my backyard '' then ? 
   taking in refugees is a gift offered to the displaced , not a right to be demanded by others . 
  only true if those `` others '' are non-human . 
  article 14 of the universal declaration of human rights states that `` everyone has the * right * to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution . '', 
  ( emphasis mine ) edit : after re-reading your comment , maybe you intended `` others '' to be read as `` non-displaced '' ; then please discard my first sentence , but still asylum is not a `` gift '' . 
   the eu 28 can rent a big ass land in turkey or greece ( like an island ) and build a megapolis with 100b euro . 
  it will still be cheaper than the current , useless , non-solution way of letting everyone in before sorting through them . 
  why would that be cheaper ? 
   it is not the job of eu to help refugees !, 
  it actually is though :  european action in this area is based on the treaty on the functioning of the european union to which the charter of fundamental rights , proclaimed in 2000 , is annexed . 
  since 2009 , the charter has been legally binding on the eu institutions and national governments ( when they are implementing eu law ) .

   ironically anti-fascist law used against fascists ( albeit a different sect ) . 
  not very ironic . 
  ma'am , you 're violating \u00a7 132a stgb . 
  i have to demand you remove the offending garment ... slowly . 
   which promotes stable relationships promotes how ? 
   there is no good reason to change it . 
  there is no good reason to force that lifestyle upon those that do n't want to live that way either . 
    people should live however the fuck they want . 
   you want to use the government to promote your preferable consensus i like / u/roadbuzz 's consensus of `` live however the fuck you want '' . 
  the government should promote that . 
  supreme lord chancellor shadowstalker . 
  it 's the name of my enya cover band . 
   yes but even them it was a pointless censorship exercise , wolf 3d and quake disks were just brought elsewhere in europe or shared through bbns elsewhere in europe ? 
  bbss ? 
  are you trying to imply that the warez fairy did n't just carpet drop the goodies all over the school yard ? 
   pointless not at all . 
  when i was a minor two decades ago , being on the index was like a seal of quality - both for music ( die \u00c4rzte ! ), 
  and for video games ( wolfenstein 3d !, 
  doom !, 
  quake ! ) . 
  not exactly what was intended , but not absolutely pointless either . 
   literally porn umm ... the video might be . 
  the song 's lyrics are way too hilarious to be porn . 
  needs more of mein leib . 
  exactly . 
  because if it had been proven to work , it would n't be `` alternative '' `` medicine '' anymore , just regular medicine . 
  are you confusing sex and gender ? 
  or are [ frogs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_reed_frog ) now people ? 
  youtube videos ca n't melt heads-of-state !, 
  well a certain other well-known nena tune might lend itself well to a song about fighter jets and bombing people . 
  so , sequel maybe ? 
  plot double-twist : he 's actually trying to conceal the fact that he has nothing to conceal by making people think he 's trying to divert people 's attention . 
  edit : or maybe that 's just what he wants you to think . 
  time will tell . 
  i doubt it will increase to the levels we saw in the 70s and 80s though . 
  however , public reaction might be different due to higher visibility and the perpetrators being seen as more external than internal . 
   i think europe is doomed . 
  europe survived the 70s and 80s with way worse numbers of terror attacks . 
  sudan aruba you say ? 
  #make austria australia again, 
   it 's dangerous to express your view with the cases i 'm familiar with , it is dangerous to express your view if your view is advocating murder . 
  people who manage to filter their hatred down a bit and manage to simulate a reasonable amount of civility , are usually fine . 
  in principle , yes , but actually it becomes 78kg of * h\u00fcftgold * for a single virgin ( of unspecified gender ) . 
   not the right to own ones own work , which the message in the screenshot is about . 
  the message in the screenshot is about the right to have google not find articles about you that are legal for the authors to write and publish ( and keep published ) . 
  where it 's always raining . 
  starvation is natures way of population control . 
   tu felix austria nube yup , max i was a master of marital arts . 
  that was kind of my point . 
  and give them the possibility to get rid of the dictator if he/she turns out to be not as benevolent as originally thought ? 
  much like a strainer , it 's hole-y . 
  one might even call it a starch misrepresentation . 
   take a wild guess at who commits it and where . 
  i 'd go with `` criminals '' and `` crime scenes '' . 
  where do i collect my prize ? 
  people would 've started shooting in the general direction of people who look vaguely like what the shooters imagine the gang members to look like . 
  ftfy, 
  i wholeheartedly agree . 
  i have a feeling that we should not only reject vigilante retaliation itself but should also reject the claim that - were vigilante retaliation a good or legal thing - this would be a legitimate instance of it . 
  however i ca n't find a good argument for why the latter would be even worth arguing - certainly there ca n't be many people who would care for that but not for the former . 
  should n't retaliation be directed at those who committed whatever act you retaliate for ? 
  exactly . 
  not unlike the english `` kraut '' , derived from [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/johann_gottfried_piefke ) . 
  an austrian guy , a german guy , a marvellously hot young blonde and a nun are travelling by train . 
  the train enters a tunnel , so everything goes dark . 
  there 's a loud slap , a short cry of pain and when the tunnel ends the german is holding his hurting cheek . 
  the nun thinks : `` the german must have tried something with that poor young girl but her morals were strong and she hit him . 
  good on her , maybe he 'll think twice next time . '', 
  the blonde thinks : `` oh poor guy . 
  he must have tried to kiss me in the dark but accidentially got the nun , who slapped him . '', 
  the german thinks : `` the stupid austrian tried to kiss the blonde , accidentially kissed the nun instead , and she tried to slap him but hit me instead because it was so dark . '', 
  the austrian thinks : `` next tunnel , i 'll beat the * piefke * again . '', 
  it 's to prevent the water splashing up and in - / onto your butthole . 
  however , other toilets are available too and afaik increasingly common because apparently kids today think that smelling your own poop is worse than being crippled and traumatized by the cringe-splash of death . 
   we need to take a firmer stance in favor of free speech before it is too late . 
  we should ban apologies to protect free speech ? 
   if we ban all opinions that might be offensive , we ban free speech . 
  well then it is good that it was n't banned and no one was prosecuted for publishing it . 
   nobody should have to apologize for exerting their constitutional right , especially not a media corporation .
