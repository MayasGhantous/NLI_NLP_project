  nobody should be prevented from apologizing for their bad judgement either . 
  while that picture is a little closer than the stuff i found on google , that still looks nothing like the caricature . 
  shape of nose , skull , ears are all completely different . 
  i 'm not saying that caricature is * intended * to look like nazi propaganda , but it certainly does to me , and there 's no reason it has to look like that to depict auer . 
  it is clear to me that it might offend people and i think it is reasonable for the bbc to apologize for that . 
  that caricature looks 100 % like jews were depicted in nazi propaganda . 
  it looks nothing like leopold auer actually looked ( judging from a quick google ) - even when accounting for the exaggeration of features that caricatures normally do . 
  i seem to find war a lot less amusing than you do . 
  but it 's the wrong room , iirc . 
  the one shown labeled as `` bundesrat '' / upper house is actually the room for the `` nationalversammlung '' , which is both houses together and a relatively rare occasion . 
  the bundesrat room itself is less fanciful ( and smaller ) . 
  ( the room shown for `` nationalrat '' is correct however ), 
  oh god my eyes !, 
  / r/crappydesign , please help !, 
  that chart ca n't be from `` bild '' , as it correctly classifies egypt as `` not in western europe '' . 
  there once was a man from a bare spot ... 
  reminds me a bit of [ this ] ( http://www.hechenblaikner.at/werkserien/hinter-den-bergen/ ) book ( austria instead of norway , and rather tongue-in-cheek ) . 
  frau kepetry , as she is known in / r/de, 
   why stay here ? 
  she was born here and likes the view ? 
  crazy gods lady . 
  no hotdogs in austria . 
   will can , if you insist on it, 
  why is drunk woman block view of ample and plentiful potato ? 
  i was joking , as cologne ( k\u00f6ln ) is generally considered the san francisco ( i.e. 
  center of lgbt culture ) of germany . 
   k\u00f6ln have you legalized mixed-sex marriage yet ? 
   vandals did not wrong !, 
  history books out for huneric !, 
   cobra 11 ?!, 
  originally called kiwi 11 , only renamed for european release to prevent hamsterk\u00e4ufe of the fruit of the same name due to its expected popularity . 
  well of course that was dubbed for broadcasting in germany . 
  my reply was 50 % pedantic and 50 % punny/funny . 
   denmarkian that would be a * dane * , and it would certainly taste * great * . 
  as stated elsewhere in this discussion , a hijab probably improves biometrics if anything , as hair is irrelevant for that . 
  do you have a swiss passport ? 
  i suspect he might talk about switzerland , where - according to the article - a mr. wobmann wants the law to be changed so the currently granted exceptions based on religious belief and disability shall be removed . 
  that 's a pretty tautological point in a discussion about changing the law , especially since the law in question currently allows for certain head coverings . 
  yes but there is no scalability problem . 
  taking a covered-hair photo is the same effort and involves the same actors as taking an uncovered-hair photo . 
   as it just does n't scale . 
  how so ? 
  that is a very interesting argument . 
  i 'll try to remember that for the next * concerned citizen * i 'm debating . 
   i had been told not to smile nor wear glasses i think that 's so today 's lame-ass biometrics can recognize you again . 
   haircut if that was the case , passports would have to be renewed every time you got a new haircut . 
  or changed hair color . 
  or my balding intensified again . 
  i can shave my head , get my passport photo done , and grow the hair out again . 
  from an identification standpoint that 's pretty much the same . 
  not to shit on the credibility of the paper , but if it ever titled `` 1 + 1 = 2 '' i 'd start doubting the fundamentals of mathematics . 
  as they do every election . 
  surprisingly enough , expats tend to vote against nationalist parties ( and also against the socialists , and pro center-right , greens and liberals ) . 
  well , half of us hopes it 's muslims , the other half hopes it 's not . 
  that 's the way it feels to me at least . 
  ( proud member of the second half . 
  fuck you , first half . ), 
  that 's what i was trying to convey , yes . 
  i am [ fighting dystopia ] ( https://cvdazzle.com/ ) !, 
  the security aspect of non-figure-hugging clothing that might help conceal objects is completely orthogonal to the face-covering aspect of a niqab ban . 
  is it because you are wearing a burqa and the lattice is interfering with your vision ? 
  i live in austria . 
  the only place i 've ever seen a burqua was in istanbul ( and there iirc it was one single occurence in a ~ week-long stay ) . 
  women wearing ( other ) niqab otoh i 've seen a few in austria , although most seemed to be tourists . 
  and i 've never heard of any security-related event in europe that could have been mitigated by a ban on niqab . 
  the security angle here is imo just something to distract from the flaws of `` women should be free to wear what they want , so to prevent their husbands/fathers from forcing them to wear x , we 'll ban them from wearing x '' . 
  more than just veiled face . 
  a burqa is typically blue ( til before the taliban blue was rare and other colors were frequently used ) and covers the * eyes * with a lattice ( although til that pakistani burkas do not ) . 
  usually you see them in pictures of afghanistan . 
  i once saw one in istanbul . 
  however , i suppose `` burqa ban '' is a misnomer anyway , i would suppose it is intended to cover ( heh ! ), 
  also face veils that do n't cover the eyes , so it 's more of a niqab ban . 
  i 've seen women wearing niqab in austria , mostly ( but not exclusively ) obvious tourists . 
  calling it a `` burqa ban '' is probably equal parts * catering to a crowd that ca n't be assed to even know the name of the thing they want to ban * preferring a well-known but inaccurate word over an accurate but less well known one * preferring a scary sounding word over a more accurate one so a bit like calling a ban of vehicle armor a `` tank ban '' , even if it would mostly cover armored limousines as privately owned tanks are almost nonexistent . 
  i have an infection and do n't want to spread it but have to do business . 
  i am a germophobe . 
  i 'm a japanese tourist . 
  i 'm michael jackson . 
   germany doesnt get cold enough that people have to cover their face . 
  sure does . 
  source : i live in austria , same climate . 
  nobody got arrested . 
  there was a video showing the guy spewing profanities at the munich shooter ( shooter was on a parking garage , shouter on his balcony looking down on that garage ) . 
  there was a brief investigation into whether this was before or after the shooting ( if it was before it might have played a role in pushing the shooter over the edge or whatever ) , but as it was afterwards , the investigation ended without any further action .

  after the tenth beer we 're ^ ( ha ) lalling though . 
  as do our hunters , who are * always * halaling ( and are * always * after the tenth beer ) . 
  i had my reasons for writing `` can '' , not `` will '' . 
  hey we already did n't elect him once , we can do it again . 
  do bmws even have indicator lights ? 
  would n't that take away precious power from the lichthupe ? 
  1/5 stars , would not genocide again . 
  well , when no place accepts his deportees , he 'll have to resort to deporting to the afterlife , amiright ? 
  the opposite of whatever pakistan voted . 
  how many germans do you need to change a light bulb ? 
  just one . 
  they are very efficient and lack humor . 
  yes . 
  also the union jack will get a slight makeover .
