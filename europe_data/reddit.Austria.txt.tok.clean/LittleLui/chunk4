  i 'm fine if the woman wants an abortion voluntarily , but sometimes she might be forced by her husband/boyfriend/pimp , so let 's ban abortions ( for that reason ) . 
  i 'm fine if a woman wants to work voluntarily , but sometimes she might be forced by her husband/boyfriend/pimp , so let 's ban women from working . 
  strange ... that logic seems to only work for head coverings . 
  yeah i 'm not exactly holding my breath for that either . 
  what i got from the news : veil ban ( formerly known as burqa ban ) for public places . 
  `` state should present itself as secular '' ( headscarf ban ? 
  no more state-mandated crosses in courts and schools ? 
  no more nuns as teachers ? 
  end of state-paid religion teachers ? 
  who knows ... ) in public offices . 
  matrix . 
  you take the red pill and are flushed out of the matrix and are therefore smarter than the sheeple who took the blue one ( or none at all ) .

   who does n't want a dragon on their passport ? 
  samuel l. jackson would n't want to take a motherfuckin ' winged legged snake on a motherfuckin ' plane . 
  yeah they all have that 20s/30s retro vibe ... / s, 
  thank god we have photoshop now , that vaseline-smudged lens look is really creepy . 
  ( probably less so if that 's what you 're used to though . ), 
  uk should do a union jack passport . 
  that would look crazy . 
   to get a clearer picture . 
  if you have a figure of 146k immigrations and exclude the second largest group in the list of origins , that makes * nothing * clearer because the numbers do n't add up anymore . 
  you either take them out of that number or you include them in the details , too . 
  anything else does n't make sense .

  i suppose is needs to have proof who did it so they can pay his family a nice pension . 
  i stand by my assertion , that is a rather uncivilized aspect of the us . 
  i do n't see the problem with that . 
  i think it 's pretty obvious that violent crime and nonviolent crime should be treated differently . 
  the civilized world does n't have death sentences and for good reasons .

  heil no ... 
  i had hoped this thread would be g\u00f6ring in a different direction . 
  dude ... 
  if that 's inconvenient , there 's always the possibility to vote by mail . 
  ... by building a wall faster than haider could steer clear of it . 
  that was the night all the freemason training paid off . 
  but he 's the playwright , not on the stage ( mostly ) . 
  and what a poet he is ... bierzelt statt shakespeare !, 
  to be fair , politicians getting called ` nazi '' is actually rather rare outside of maybe facebook comments and over-the-top leftist youth organizations . 
  that 's more like a qualifying race , 
  i always see this brought forward as a kind of criticism , but that 's kind of the whole point of having a runoff election , is n't it ? 
  we 'll happily shit on them for nothing , but when they actually screw up we deal with it like bros. 
  the fp\u00d6 as a whole , and hofer is no exemption here , manage to play this surprisingly well - always giving a nod and a wink to the extreme right but when asked the nod was just a little tic and the wink was because they had something in the eye and 30 % voted for them and why would you even call 30 % of the people nazis ?!, 
  and to be honest , a few nods and winks is probably all it takes to convince the `` sieg heil !, 
  '' - shouters and `` we 'll reopen mauthausen '' - posters ( which i sincerely hope are a small minority amongst those 30 % -35 % fp\u00d6 voters we 've seen in the last few elections ) not to stay at home on election day , and it would certainly be stupid of them to not grab those votes . 
  so it 's debatable whether those nods and winks are even indicative of the actual ideology of hofer and strache - but it 's scary nonetheless that it 's possible to both continuously do those winks and nods yet manage to get elected by a third of the voters . 
  afaik , it is related with `` guten morgen '' , but actually with the `` guten '' part , not the `` morgen '' . 
  therefore it can also mean `` good day/evening/night / whatever '' . 
  / ftfy, 
  because the hills have eyes !, 
  you 're right , my bad . 
  much like it was from 1923 till the establishment of ~ ~ schengen ~ ~ free movement in the eu ( lisbon treaty ratified 2008/2009 in uk/ireland ? 
  first you need some group to actually start the uprising . 
  could be a sect , cult , maybe an ethnic group , something like a clan , anything really . 
  for the sake of the argument , let 's say it 's a single clan that becomes disloyal to the king and maybe persuades other clams to join in . 
  now to hide a clan in a bunch of salt , you have to remember two things : stealth , and divide and conquer . 
  we 'll start with `` divide and conquer '' . 
  you split that clan right down the middle : cl an . 
  now for the stealth part : you flip things around ( cl na ) , mix em up a bit ( na cl ) and get funky with the lettering , et voila : nacl you just throw that in the salt and it will blend right in . 
   disclaimer : transfer of recep tayyip erdogan is to be completed afterwards . 
  there 's this board game , called `` civilization '' , in which you gain wealth by trading resource cards with other players . 
  there 's cards like `` salt '' , `` cloth '' , `` gold '' etc. 
  however , looking identical to the actual resources , there 's also things like `` plague '' , `` civil war '' and other catastrophes that you can hide in the package of cards you swap with the other players , leading to them having to deal with the fallout of said catastrophes . 
  just an interesting fact , i have no idea why i was just thinking about that . 
  can i have your kebab and raki now that you have gyros and ouzo ?
