  very cool, 
  i do n't get it . 
  a german would pronounce it more like `` skwir\u00e4ll '' , not like ... whatever this is . 
  i consider myself a pretty big eu ` fanboy ' , but i do n't think i can agree with that statement . 
  you should provide some specific examples of `` western '' politicians that you think should be targeted and punished in the same manner as african leaders by the icc . 
  that said , if the icc were to indeed target politicans from he usa or russia , they probably would say `` lolnope '' and simply laugh in their face . 
  why even bother ? 
  politics are n't about equality and fairness , they are about who has the biggest stick and/or the fattest purse . 
  african countries have neither . 
  i unplug and switch off all electronic devices at night . 
  partly due to frugality , partly due to environmentalism , partly due to ocd . 
  nothing or socks, 
  i 'd say here iranians have a lot better reputation than arabs or turks . 
  it 's over now , but last week we had 37c here . 
  i pulled the curtains so no sun comes in and put on the ventilator . 
  i think it 's about the same as last year . 
  true , and chevrolet also belongs to it . 
  but stuff like tesla or cadillac i have literally never seen here . 
  most people do n't give a shit . 
  japanese : hyundai , nissan , toyota , mazda are all really common american : general motors is virtually unknown here . 
  ford , fiat and chevrolet are pretty popular . 
  my dad is currently driving his third ford mondeo . 
  you sound like you could n't even find norway on a map ... 
  like that smug cousin who does everything better . 
  in my school around age 13 it was common to have smoked and having been drunk a few times ( not me personally though ) . 
  of course more or less secretly , but there was never much fuss about it . 
  italy and croatia . 
  i have learned that each european country thinks of their mentality and customs as very unique and special . 
  in reality we 're all very , very similar in most regards . 
  whenever someone says stuff like `` haha we here in x like cheap booze '' , `` haha we here in x complain so much '' , `` haha this is so typical for x '' i just roll my eyes now . 
  most people think their country is more special than it is . 
  i consider it a * nation * . 
  it 's generally frowned upon here . 
  most castles are in remote places and also private property . 
  you ca n't just walk in . 
  very popular , but i think it 's disgusting . 
   in certain threads everyone 's praising poland for fighting against the muslim invasion , staying homogenous , and not being politically correct and now everyone 's criticizing them . 
  those are alt right kids straight from / r/the _ donald who have no idea what they are talking about . 
  poland is simply an unattractive country for immigration for most third worlders . 
  as a result they have no muslims or terrorism , so somehow that makes them the * saviors of western civilization * . 
  pure retardation . 
  / r/europe is a pretty pro-eu sub , and poland 's ruling party is very eurosceptic . 
  that 's where the criticism is coming from . 
  they are viewed mostly as the `` good '' and `` civilized '' muslims . 
  very good reputation for a mena country . 
  to be honest you probably should n't read any `` right wing/left wing media '' at all . 
  what 's the point of reading so-called `` news '' if they inevitably warp facts and events to suit their own agenda ? 
  some are more subtle , some are more hamfisted , but at least do n't try to actively seek out such media . 
  you 'll never find out the truth at this rate . 
  you should look for hard facts from neutral , unbiased , unemotional , and most importantly , * reliable * sources and form an opinion . 
  asking people who * actually live here * is a great start . 
  you seem lost . 
  stormfront is [ this ] ( https://www.stormfront.org/forum/ ) way buddy . 
  in german it works the same as english . 
  negative questions are often used as a form of [ suggestive question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suggestive_question ) , whereby a certain answer is expected . 
  for example , `` is n't trump an idiot ? '', 
  implies that this is your opinion , and you expect the other person to agree/challenge them to disagree . 
  this is why those questions are sometimes considered rude/aggressive/confrontational . 
  in central europe it can be very rainy or even snowy , and the temperatures wo n't go above 18 \u00b0 celsius or so . 
  someone played too much eu iv ... 
  changing all your clothes * every day * sounds like a pure waste of time , energy , and water . 
  recently a jew asked me for my number . 
  i told him we have names here instead . 
  i see even your national animal wears socks and sandals ... 
  most days i leave the house . 
  since my childhood in the 90s i have n't noticed an increase or decrease . 
  they are n't noteworthy or special . 
  nope . 
  if it was n't a national holiday i 'd forget it exists . 
  you can celebrate days that belong to cultures other than yours . 
  i see nothing wrong with it . 
  consuming a chocolate bunny at easter is no different than consuming spooky candy on halloween is no different than consuming american burgers in stars & stripes packaging on 4th july . 
  i say , this might be considered `` celebrating '' by some . 
  i am not saying people are actually doing this ; but the assumption could be made they are . 
  now you 're just playing dumb . 
   my argument is pretty clear , stop talking about muslims like they are the enemy . 
  they are not . 
  not yet . 
  to ensure it remains that way , we * need * to enact countermeasures to radicalization . 
  and this might mean putting muslims in europe on a tighter leash . 
  christianity is a non-factor here . 
  do n't be edgy . 
  this is the culture we 're living in , wether you personally like it or not . 
  but * consuming * said themed products is , arguably . 
  the reason is $ $ $ . 
  people consume a lot of american media and see references to 4th of july , it 's not unreasonable to think some marketing companies might try to promote it . 
  in fact that 's exactly what 's happening in the link from / u/eurovisionist7 . 
  i am not offended , as i am no ( practicing ) christian . 
  but your arguments are all over the place without any sense of direction . 
  retarded whataboutism to distract from the * real * , actual issues europe is facing * now * . 
  why not bring up the 30 years war while you 're at it . 
  and the crusades too . 
  i still do n't get why you brought up ` non-adapting ' christians . 
  christian religious extremism is not a problem on the same scale as islamic extremism in europe , end of story . 
  what exactly does that have to do with christians ? 
  they do exist in vienna , but are n't common at all . 
  i think it 's not quite the same thing . 
  the usa still has a lot more cultural influence over european countries than the other way around . 
  the question is justified . 
  not necessarily stupid , but * very * uneducated at least .
