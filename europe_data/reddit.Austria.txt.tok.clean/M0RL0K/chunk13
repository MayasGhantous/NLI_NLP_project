  but young adults who do n't speak at least basic english pretty much do n't exist anymore , at least in my area . 
  english is a compulsory subject in middle/high school-equivalents , ( though many start in kindergarten/elementary ) and there is massive everyday exposure to english through media , technology and especially the internet . 
  you are more likely to encounter a pink elephant than a young adult who does n't speak english at all . 
  and my country ( and probably also germany ) is probably on the lower end in western europe , because we get a lot of stuff translated to german . 
  scandinavians or dutch , for example , often do n't have that luxury , so their english tends to be better . 
  pretty sure australia has more of those as well ... 
  then again , if they are native in venezuela they do n't count as * exotic * there , do they ? 
  yes , this is a thing that has worked and been promoted in the netherlands , but it 's the exact opposite here and in large parts of germany . 
  urban planning is often non-existent , people build wherever . 
  areas like randstad do n't exist here . 
  well i think both taste alright , but every spargel-saison there 's ridiculous hype about it , and there exist self-proclaimed ` afficionados ' like for no other vegetable . 
  i suspect it may be because of the time-consuming harvesting method . 
  tree fiddy , in my experience . 
  i do n't have the energy to expand further on this or refute all your points , but i encourage you to google ` zersiedelung ' and ` urban sprawl ' ( not sure what the word is in dutch ) and find out why it 's a bad thing and a massive burden on the environment . 
  bavarian wei\u00dfwurst is very different from that . 
  i never understood why people go so crazy over spargel . 
  it tastes okay and kind of bland , no idea what 's supposedly so amazing about it . 
  [ relevant . 
  ` culture ' is arbitrary . 
  as an austrian , do i belong to the same culture as a czech or dutchman ? 
  cases could be made for yes or no . 
  as a viennese , a city-dweller , am i closer culturally to a czech from prague , a 3rd generation turk in vienna , or to a rural farmer somewhere in the austrian alps ? 
  cases could be made for all 3 . 
  several reasons : * ineffective use of space . 
  * loss of natural areas and habitat for animals . 
  * more car travel due to longer distances between houses and no public transport . 
  * higher and ineffective energy consumption ( heating costs ) . 
  * high costs for infrastructure ( electricity , water , internet , etc. 
  ) , despite low pop . 
  density . 
  paid for by everyone 's taxes , therefore waste of money . 
  good . 
  `` zersiedelung '' needs to stop . 
  ` defect ' does n't mean what you think it means . 
  top comment says  reddit 's a pretty bad sample because it skews left , which skews anti-american . 
  top reply is  exactly . 
  the amount of communist bullshit that gets posted on reddit is really depressing , until you remember that these idiots are mostly just on the internet . 
  so that 's exactly what they are doing . 
  they then babble on about how reddit is the left wing equivalent of * fucking breitbart * . 
  never mind the fact that the far-right is the most vocal and obnoxious group here on reddit as well , much more than so-called `` communists '' , and actual communists who stick to their echo chamber subs . 
  so they are either : a ) idiots who ca n't distinguish between communist and left/socialist . 
  b ) lying to push their own agenda . 
  c ) both . 
  i love how one of the top comments in the original thread equates left-wing with communism . 
  bunch of retards . 
  ... damn it . 
  * most * , not all . 
  i do n't get what 's so amazing about that one , it 's more or less just chocolate cake :p, 
  deep-fried means cooked in oil or fat . 
  kosovo : [ albin kurti ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soirgkmpn9u&amp;feature=youtu.be ) and [ his party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vet%c3%abvendosje ) . 
  i learned of them through reddit . 
  while apparently a bit controversial , the rise of this party from a grassroots movement has been very impressive . 
  although serbians might disagree ... 
  he [ played himself in a clip ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04zn3l1pzqi ) in a popular late night show . 
  he is depicted as the boss of the hosts , `` censoring '' jokes about himself and his party . 
  i think it 's pretty hilarious if you understand german . 
  sure you did n't hear `` es lebe der kaiser '' ( long live the emperor ) ? 
  none , really , but the closest things would be : * * austriae est imperare orbi universo * , or * alles erdreich ist \u00d6sterreich untertan * ( austria is destined to rule the world ) old habsburg motto , typically abbreviated as * a.e.i.o.u. * . 
  * ( again and again , austria ! ), 
  typical football chant . 
  * * rot-wei\u00df-rot bis in den tod * ( red-white-red until dead ), 
  beer from amazon ... we sure live in interesting times . 
  you behave like an typical alt right troll trying to be clever , but whatever . 
  are you a german citizen ? 
  do you speak the language ? 
  have you ever lived in europe for an extended period of time ? 
  if the answer to one or more questions is no , you are not german and not european . 
  on the other hand , a third generation german with arabic roots , who has german citizenship , speaks the language , was born and lives there , is objectively european . 
  his religion or values are irrelevant . 
  both jesus and saint nicholas ( who santa is ultimately based off ) were real persons from the middle east . 
  it 's just that `` neoliberalism '' gets thrown around a lot and means different things to different people , i was n't quite sure what he is talking about . 
  i see it like this : pandering , spinning things to suit your agenda , making big promises regardless wether you can keep them , etc. , are pretty much required if you want to get elected . 
  regardless of intentions , every successful politician has to esort to such underhanded tactics sooner or later . 
  it 's how democracies work . 
  politics is n't about who is the most upstanding and honest citizen , it 's about convincing as many people as possible that * your way * is the * right way * . 
  there are of course plenty of stupid , egoistic , greedy and corrupt politicians who exploit the system , but i believe there 's also a lot that genuinely care about their country and their obligation to the people . 
  i think a lot of people underestimate how difficult , taxing and thankless a poltician 's job can be . 
  they fill a role in our society that 's just as important as , say , that of a firefighter . 
  still do n't get if you 're pro or anti eu . 
  explain . 
  they are scams , plain and simple . 
  the various goods of those street vendors are either overpriced , have been obtained through illegal means , and most likely both . 
  as for the flower sellers , from my experience , their modus operandi is this : they will run up to people , thrust the flower into their hand , then demand payment . 
  it 's a scam . 
  furthermore , these are usually young girls , * children * . 
  it is effectively child labor . 
  `` tourist-related-jobs '' my ass ... call it what it is : * organized crime * . 
  [ this one .

  especially the last paragraph . 
  flat out refusing to adhere to the quota , agreed upon by majority , is a direct violation . 
  so first agreeing to a participate in a democratic process , then after the decision was made , saying `` lolno '' is a reasonable suggestion ? 
  you expect the eu to just say `` ah whatever it 's fine guys '' ? 
  it was actually in elementary school . 
  i ca n't remember that much , but fourth grade was very europe-focussed , we learned english and made presentations about all different european countries and cultures . 
  we even did a stage play about the eu , where we `` sang '' about the different countries and how they came together , with which we actually won a prize at some event . 
  i 'm sure it was n't actually meant to `` indoctrinate '' us , but i suppose it left an impresssion on me . 
  i came to the conclusion that the eu is a good , important thing many years later on my own , but i think in part due to this i regarded it as something positive all my life . 
  the eu tried to do just that and visegrad threw a massive tantrum . 
  so this wo n't be happening for a long time .
