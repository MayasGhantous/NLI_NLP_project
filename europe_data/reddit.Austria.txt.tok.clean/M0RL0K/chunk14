  i was n't sure how to put it ... we did some `` european unity-themed '' projects . 
  you swamp people have strange instincts ... 
  very strong , but i went to a pro-eu school during the peak of eu-hype , so i actually think i might be slightly `` indoctrinated '' . 
  do n't think that 's a bad thing though . 
  implanting a strong european identity in kids is important if the european project is to succeed . 
  this does n't necessarily have to replace national identity ; i firmly believe both can coexist . 
  in my opinion , a true nationalist who wants a prosperous future for their country should be in favor of a strong , united europe . 
  i do n't know anyone ( under 30 ) who did n't . 
  never . 
  edit : quarter pounder here is called `` hamburger royal ts '', 
  pretty sure it 's rare here as well . 
  i was to a kz mauthausen * exactly * 11 years ago . 
  username does n't check out . 
  personal guilt , not really . 
  but vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung , as you put it , is very real and regarded as important . 
  i think now , that the last contemporay witnesses of this time are dying off , it 's more important than ever to remember and talk about this time . 
  we learn a lot about ww2 in school . 
  unlike previous generations , we are taught that austria was not a victim , but very much active participant of the whole nazi thing . 
  kz mauthausen still stands and is a mandatory ( i think ? ), 
  visit for every school kid here . 
  my class also made a trip to auschwitz where we listened to survivors . 
  maternal grandfather is hungarian . 
  sometimes people will comment on my surname but that 's it . 
  i admit that `` survive '' might be a bit dramatic/badly worded . 
  but i still do n't see how being able to resist foreign ( as in american , chinese , russian , and who knows who else in the future ) equates to `` big bad superpower and dominate the world again '' . 
  to talk dismissively of a united eu capable of a strong foreign policy is easy for someone sitting on his comfy islands and their pile of nukes . 
  but for a small , ( nominally ) neutral country in central europe like mine , the situation is a bit different . 
   august  winter k, 
  no it 's not . 
  for some reason you equate `` protect interests '' , and `` some sort of union '' with `` big bad superpower '' . 
  so the only options are either being irrelevant or a `` big bad superpower '' ? 
  what kind of retardation is this ? 
   europe has been one of the most relevant continents , if not the most relevant , for centuries . 
  times change . 
  if you think european countries will be able to survive , without some sort of union , on their own in the upcoming century , you are incredibly naive . 
   speak about your own country , mine is not `` shitty '' . 
  and if its economy is terrible , consider it started being like this when we were thrown in the `` eec '' , the predecessor of the `` eu '' . 
  * i was being diplomatic * . 
  objectively speaking , your country is far `` shittier '' than mine , and will be for a loooong time . 
  did n't greece forge papers about it 's economic situation to get entry into the eurozone ? 
  of course we have plenty of arms companies , but there is no `` military industrial complex '' like in america . 
  because close cooperation is the best chance for europe to remain politically relevant and protect it 's interests on a global stage . 
  why anyone , particularly from shitty , weak little countries like yours and mine would be against this is beyond me . 
  a true nationalist who wants the best for their country should be * massively * pro-eu . 
  you mean specifically as an arms developer/manufacturer for the government ? 
  non-existent , on the same scale at least . 
  it means everyone fends and looks out for themselves first . 
  it means a `` dog '' will `` eat '' another dog the first chance he gets if it becomes beneficial to him , and this behavior is accepted by society . 
  the reality is , both the usa and europe , and indeed all so-called `` developed '' nations are dog-eat-dog societies . 
  our wealth and cheap goods come from exploiting third world countries for their resources and cheap labor . 
  the naked truth is , basically every one of us is enabling modern-day slavery . 
  some are just more aware of it then others . 
  that 's not to say those third world countries are any better . 
  precisely * because * they are so poor , individual wealth and success is placed on an even bigger pedestal , no matter by what means achieved . 
  the way i see it , the rising sun flag is more of a general symbol of japan ( particularly imperial japan ) , while the hakenkreuz mainly represents the nazi ideology . 
  so while i can understand why many people do n't like it , a better comparison would be to the imperial german flag of 1871-1918 , or the reichskriegsflagge . 
  as others have said , air con is not the norm here . 
  for the few really hot summer weeks i have a ventilator . 
  now kiss . 
  you should strip down , self-flagellate , and profusely apologize for everything to your intellectually superior european betters . 
  my point is that i would not choose it , which is op 's question . 
  mother 28 , father 30, 
  nope , you were born to old parents . 
  i kew you would object to that ... but yeah , disqualified for several reasons . 
  meh i personally do n't like it ... 
  agreed , it 's a cool location but does n't necessarily look out of place .

  i 'm a pale cave dweller who shuns sunlight . 
  my taint hurts just from reading that . 
  do n't vote conservative . 
  growing up in vienna , lots immigrants ( mostly from balkans and turkey , some africans ) are part of everyday life since i can remember . 
  i do n't mind them or care about them . 
  there are n't really any `` ghettos '' as is the case allegedly in other european cities . 
  they are spread relatively evenly , although there are a few notorious `` hotspots '' . 
  overall , coexistence is very relaxed and peaceful . 
  there is no terrorsim or anything . 
  personally i do n't interact much with them , apart from buying food . 
  turkish/kurdish/arab youths can get rowdy and annoying , but i do n't blame them , since this behavior stems from their upbringing and culture . 
  i firmly believe that many of them are actually having identity crises . 
  they are n't real austrians/europeans , but also not real citizens of their native countries . 
  i do n't envy them . 
  we also have a shit ton of germans , but those i do n't really count . 
  lock myself inside and play video games all day , probably . 
  do n't think it 's used often , but when it is everyone knows what it means . 
  yep . 
  i think they should be punished , out of principle . 
  sometimes you have to accept things agreed upon by the majority , even if you do n't like them . 
  that 's how it works in any democracy , it 's just on a larger scale on the european level .
