  if the eu let 's it 's members walk all over it without consequences , what chance will there ever be to have an actual common policy and work towards common goals ? 
  did you just say poland = `` eastern europe '' ? 
  oh boy , you 've done it now !, 
  i personally never read any of the books , but i watched a lot of astrid lindgren stuff as a kid . 
  differences between austria and germany : * language . 
  while most austrian accents belong to the [ bavarian dialects ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bavarian_dialects ) , the austrian ones are generally much stronger and widespread . 
  typically , a german can be identified very easily by an austrian by his language . 
  the reverse is n't always the case , as austrians can get mistaken for bavarians or even swiss . 
  * geography . 
  due to the alps and generally more bumpy terrain , agriculture works/worked a lot differently . 
  this in turn affects cuisine and customs a lot . 
  * due to it 's history as a multi-ethnic state , there 's a lot of slavic and hungarian cultural influence in language , cuisine and customs , especially in eastern austria . 
  i 'm not sure about berlin . 
  but i think bavaria definitely has more in common , both culturally and linguistically , with austria , than , for example , with schleswig-holstein . 
  everything is dubbed in german , so as a small kid i did n't watch any english language stuff . 
  i pretty much learned the language only from elementary and high school . 
  later i started consuming english language series , games , books and ofc the internet and became more fluent through that . 
  true , but did he just confuse flags or something ? 
  and my point is that this dislike is n't at all similar or comparable . 
  open borders and freedom of movement were one of the main reasons for brexit in the first place . 
  joining schengen now would be going full retard and probably political suicide . 
  it 's insulting to compare the relationship and history of austria and germany to that of poland and russia . 
  for what it 's worth , i , as an austrian , agree with you . 
  it 's not a dumb question and the answer is n't easy . 
  mr danish guy has a few misconceptions . 
  that 's a ridiculous and insulting comparison . 
  how can anyone upvote this stupidity ? 
  the concept of a greater german nation and ethnicity is a lot older than that , and for most of it 's history , austria was part of that . 
  very true . 
  this is also why i am actually anti-neutrality ( although austria 's neutrality only exists on paper anyway ) . 
  accurate . 
  i think this is the case everywhere . 
  whining about and shitting on your own country is cool as long as * you * do it . 
  but god forbid if someone else does it , a lot of people suddenly become super nationalist surprisingly fast . 
  it 's impossible to say . 
  if there was a referendum about it right now , in the current situation , it would most likely horribly fail . 
  austria is already * very * closely economically intertwined with germany , and with both in the eu , there really is n't much incentive to completely join together . 
  however , in the future , should circumstances change , and there was a definitive benefit to it , who knows . 
  the roots to this lie in the so-called [ german question ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question ) and [ german dualism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria%e2%80%93prussia_rivalry ) . 
  austria was excluded from the newly formed german empire because it lost the war for supremacy over all germans against prussia . 
  however , even after that , the german-speakers of austria - hungary were still universally considered `` ethnic germans '' . 
  when a-h broke up after ww1 , the `` german '' remnant almost unanimously wanted to join the weimar republic , but this was prevented by the entente . 
  but this new state was still called `` deutsch\u00f6sterreich '' ( german austria ) , and it 's citizens were still , for all intents and purposes , considered ethnic germans . 
  this is also in part why nazi germany encountered so little resistance during the anschluss . 
  it was largely seen as the final reunification of all germans . 
  this is also why i get a little annoyed when people say `` dae hitler was austrian xd '' . 
  it 's a fact that at the time , he was both , and he * hated * austria as a political entity . 
  during the aftermath of ww2 , the new austrian government pushed the [ victim theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victim_theory ) , a narrative that painted austria as the first victim , even though many austrians were complicit nazis . 
  i personally know for a fact that my great-grand uncle and great-grandfather were enthusiastic nsdap members , even before 1938 . 
  most austrians nowadays do n't give a shit about concepts such as ethnicity or shared history . 
  they are annoyed at the way germans talk , and being not-german is part of the national identity . 
  it 's mostly shit-talking , tongue-in-cheek , not more . 
  the texas comparison is actually quite fitting . 
  the attitude of southerners towards `` yankees '' is in many ways similar to that of austrians and bavarians towards northern germans , called `` piefken '' and `` sauprei\u00dfen '' . 
  i think your friends are spending to much time on / pol / and the_donald . 
  in it 's current state , completely out of the question . 
  but if they ever get their shit together , i actually would n't be opposed to a secular , democratic , pro-western turkey joining eventually . 
  it 's already called that in my native language , and czech republic is needlessly long . 
  the question is very non specific and as a result the answers will vary , because everyone will interpret it differently , but that 's not my problem . 
  op did n't specify what exactly he means by `` regulation '' . 
  in the broadest sense , laws are nothing more than a form of regulation , i.e. 
  a specific code of conduct imposed by some authority . 
  and while an aqueduct itself may not be a regulation , without them it could n't be built in the first place . 
  no regulations at all also means no infrastructure , no laws , no society . 
  so , effectively anarchy . 
  i would definitely take the over-regulated option , because being reliably able to shower at specific times is better than no shower at all . 
  where did you look those numbers up ? 
  the 3 baltic states . 
  estonia probably most of all . 
  easy for you to say , sitting on your comfy island and your pile of nukes . 
  i 'm not talking about becoming a superpower , i 'm talking about not being the playball of america , russia and china . 
  in my opinion , smaller countries like mine should always be in some sort of strong union for better survival . 
  history has shown time and time again that in the end , `` neutrality '' does n't mean jack shit . 
  less autonomy . 
  the country has barely 9 mil . 
  people , yet is needlessly divided into 9 federal states , modeled more or less after germany . 
  more centralisation and less powerful states , or the abolishment altogether would increase efficiency in various areas a lot . 
  this wo n't happen though , because the heads of state are way too powerful and protective of their privileges . 
  vienna has it 's own american football team , the ** vienna vikings ** , and also ice hockey team , the ** vienna capitals ** . 
  no idea why they 're called that , probably to sound cool . 
  the eu is n't perfect and makes for a great scapegoat , but what 's the alternative ? 
  shitty little countries bickering amongst each other , achieving nothing , and fading into obscurity . 
  the eu is the best chance for europe to remain politically independent and relevant , and to efficiently tackle the challenges that await us this century . 
  he 'd be a centre-left social democrat . 
  traditionally this is the strongest party in my country , so he 'd fit in just fine . 
  something for edgy kids and naive manchildren . 
   * allies currently meeting the nato guideline to spend a minimum of 2 % of their gross domestic product ( gdp ) on defence will aim to continue to do so . 
  * likewise , allies spending more than 20 % of their defence budgets on major equipment , including related research & development , will continue to do so . 
  * allies whose current proportion of gdp spent on defence is below this level will : halt any decline in defence expenditure ; aim to increase defence expenditure in real terms as gdp grows ; ** aim to move towards the 2 % guideline within a decade ** with a view to meeting their nato capability targets and filling nato 's capability shortfalls . 
  source : http://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm this agreement , by the way , i 'm pretty sure is not legally binding . 
  in any scenario , wether the goals are reached by 2024 or not , the under 2 % - spenders do not `` owe '' nato or the usa anything . 
  of course in response the usa and other 2 % + spenders could decide to cut back themselves . 
  seems unlikely though , as i 'm pretty sure trump plans an increase in military spending and cut back on social security . 
  also hurts when another austrian constantly shits on vienna ... we all have our guilty pleasures do n't we ? 
  ;d seriously though i know a few s\u00fcdtiroler and they all are perfectly content with their dual identity ; the ones getting emotional about this stuff are mostly north of the border . 
  you mean like [ this guy ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6e5jqr/when_foreigners_study_in_europe_what_happens_when/ ) ? 
  our current chancellor ( head of govt . ), 
  is center left , and his party will most likely finish 1st or 2nd in elections . 
  vdb is n't centrist he 's pretty far left . 
  it 's not a widely discussed topic or issue .
