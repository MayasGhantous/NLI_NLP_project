  but fringe opinion among radicals ? 
  not so sure . 
  i was half-joking , they are n't * really * openly flying the german flag . 
  but fact is that serious , right-wing nationalism in austria is closely linked with pan-germanism , which emphasizes one german `` vaterland '' that includes austria regardless of borders . 
  no one knows quite sure to which degree these `` deutschnationale '' reject the austrian state and seriously want reunification , and it probably varies individually . 
  i actually do n't really know what flag they use at their gatherings , and do n't plan on finding out . 
  the austrian flag definitely a symbol of state , rather than the people , since it 's derived from the crest of the first ruling house . 
  it has no special name , and most people do n't care too much about it . 
  of course being the official symbol of austria , it has a certain prestige , but that 's about it . 
  since we are a federal state , often people have greater attachment to the regional flag than to the national flag . 
  it 's not typical to fly it at any private gatherings or celebrations like you described , except among hardcore right-wing nationalists ( then again , those might prefer the german or maybe a certain * older * flag ... ) . 
  the only place i use the flag is reddit and other internet places . 
  if i were inclined to attend football games or similar events , maybe i would get a physical one . 
  i personally think it * looks * very boring , but i like it nonetheless for it 's badass origin story . 
  i think op is talking about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_schleswig_war ) war , while you mean [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_schleswig_war ) war . 
  he got schooled pretty hard by / u/no _ real_username , let 's hope some of it got through . 
  what people mean when they talk about `` right wing '' are far-right parties like ukip ( uk ) , fn ( france ) , afd ( germany ) , pvv ( netherlands ) , fp\u00d6 ( austria ) , and others . 
  the problem with these parties is that they tend to spout xenophobia , anti-immigration and anti-eu rhetoric and promise a whole lot , but do not provide actual , feasible solutions to problems , let alone any economic competence . 
  and fact of the matter is , if you vote for one of these parties , you * are * anti-refugee . 
  period . 
  politics are n't simply divided into `` left-wing vs right-wing '' , and you ca n't blame the `` left wing '' on problems with immigration alone . 
  angela merkel , for example , who is often singularly blamed for the so-called refugee crisis , is a centre-right politician , but ideologically , she has very little in common with the afd . 
  similarly , `` left wingers '' are not all 100 % pro-immigration and pro-islam . 
  most of us acknowledge that there are huge problems that need fixing , but simply do not believe that voting far-right will improve the overall situation . 
  rather the opposite . 
  i know of one who got dismissed because he abused the flex time schedule , called in sick a lot then failed to bring a doctor 's note , and on top of that underperformed . 
  apparently he said he wanted to contest it , but nothing ever came of it and never heard from him again so he most likely did n't bother . 
  and honestly even if he had contested and won , what would really be the point ? 
  relationship with employer and working climate would be ruined at that point and then he 'd probably end up leaving anyway . 
  if you ca n't speak/aren ' t comfortable with the native language , you should start with something like `` excuse me , you speak english ? '' . 
  it 's generally the polite thing to do in my opinion . 
  [ i got chicago/new york ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/12/20/sunday-review/dialect-quiz-map.html?r=40020111000012003008j000j0n001040j40210j010208j000 ) . 
  a lot of these words i have never heard of , and do n't have an equivalent in my native language . 
  so i took * does n't exist * / * other * a lot . 
  overall i think it 's pretty pointless because no one would seriously think i 'm american once i opened my mouth . 
  not if we do it first ... 
  switzerland . 
  then you are either lying , an anomaly , or denmark is much more cosmopolitan , open and tolerant compared to my country , than i assumed . 
  regardless , my opinion stands . 
  the amount of non-racist , `` colorblind '' people in europe is often vastly overestimated . 
  no it does n't and to one i know either ( except my racist grandparents ) . 
  but i also live in a big multicultural city and very left-leaning environment . 
  to assume that people in the countryside , who have never met , let alone interacted with a dark skinned will have similar views is arrogant and naive . 
  i just googled this guy and `` person of color '' is reaaaalllly stretching it . 
  he is half-indian with an irish mother , and almost 100 % `` white-passing '' . 
  if not for his name , most people would n't even suspect his ancestry . 
  i 'm not too familiar with irish politics but if it 's similar to other european countries , i daresay a visibly foreign-looking person ( i.e. 
  much darker skin , asian features etc. ), 
  would have a much harder time . 
  this is such crap . 
  stop pretending this is only an american thing . 
  skin color and ethnicity of a politician may not matter to you , but it does to a large portion of the european population , and therefore this would be a significant event . 
  i mean when other languages are spoken with that accent , do n't be dense . 
  dutch and danish . 
  very un-sexy to me , no offence . 
  oversimplify means that not everything in my post 100 % applies to every nation or ethnicity withing uk/spain . 
  that 's why i wrote `` essentially '' beforehand , to show it is n't clear-cut in some cases . 
  in scotland 's case , fine they were n't conquered . 
  their initial willingness to join and their willingness to stay now are debatable at best . 
  and the point about being a small nation ruled over by a bigger one definitely applies . 
  in any case , this is n't meant to be pro or anti independence , i 'm simply trying to roughly outline the differences between these 4 different countries and their relationships to, 
  true , i was oversimplifying it . 
  i 'm sure there 's a few other exceptions in there as well . 
  and all my other points still apply to scotland . 
  too much about ancient rome , ww2 and holocaust . 
  germany and italy : went from small states to a united country only about 150 years ago ( even less if you count ddr in germany 's case ) . 
  made up of different historical regions and cultures , but by and large , they all consider themselves `` ethnically '' german/italian respectively . 
  they all joined together willingly ( exception : alto adige , but they 're cool with it now ) . 
  uk and spain : have been unified countries for much longer , but consist of one dominant `` nation '' ( england/castile ) ruling over the smaller ones ( wales , scotland/catalonia , basques ) . 
  they were essentially conquered and never really given a choice . 
  as a result , the emphasis on independence is much stronger . 
  so in essence , they are polar opposites . 
  germany and italy , for most of their history , struggled to unite into one country , while uk and spain struggled to keep the country together . 
  german : native language english : taught since elementary school , mandatory in all high schools italian : mandatory 2nd language beside english , could have chosen french also , do n't speak it fluently nowadays, 
  oregon maybe ? 
  always found it intriguing . 
  least of all i would like to live in the south or midwest . 
  whatever you say bro . 
  why do you care about that ? 
  what knowledge do you seek to gain by this question ? 
  are you an arab-american with an identity crisis ? 
  actual arab ? 
  i 'm legitimately curious now . 
  well , you 've got me there . 
  it ai n't a joke buddy . 
  well , definitely not the germans . 
  edit : for the record , this is just some friendly bantz , i have german relatives and love my northern brudis very much . 
  so do n't get your panties in a bunch please . 
  [ mine ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=67.7&amp;d=50.5&amp;g=50.0&amp;s=74.0 ) pretty accurate , as i consider myself a moderate left social democrat . 
  but this quiz is obviously made by americans , for americans . 
  now show us yours , op . 
  why not both ? 
  seems to work for the usa . 
  flair up at least if you 're gon na answer anyway . 
  do n't care about sports but you 're right , that one takes the cake as far as circlejerks go . 
  most famous battles in which austria participated ended in spectacular losses . 
  in fact , austria is very often the `` villain '' in * other * countries ' miracle battles . 
  but here 's a few ( more or less ) significant wins : * sieges of vienna , [ 1529 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_vienna ) and [ 1683 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vienna ) : no description needed . 
  * [ battle of aspern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aspern-essling ) : napoleon 's first major defeat ( allegedly ) . 
  not very well known internationally , because the war was lost soon after .
