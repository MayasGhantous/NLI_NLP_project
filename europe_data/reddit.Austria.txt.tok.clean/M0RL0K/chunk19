  the mere presence of those things does not , by itself , imply the outcome . 
  but it does . 
  confederations of nomadic , warlike horse-archers from central asia always raided and conquered their sedentary , `` civilized '' neighbours . 
  the mongols were just the last and most successful in a long list of those . 
  you think without genghis khan they would have just sat on their hands for eternity ? 
  not only that , he also wants to ban whites from procreating and make islam state religion , which is in line with eu policy . 
  my ass told me this today . 
  yes . 
  the german word for it ( `` flohmarkt '' ) means exactly the same . 
  we sometimes have them right in the inner city districts ( vienna ) , and it gets really cramped up and crowdy . 
  annoying if you live there , but they are only on weekends a few times a year . 
  the goods are pretty much the same you described : cheap food , antiques , clothes , jewelry , toys , game cartridges , comics , etc. . 
  it `` kinda '' lives on through the whole country of germany , which is a successor state of the german empire , which was formed by the kingdom of prussia . 
  but prussia as a political entity is gone ( probably ) forever , and so are large parts of it 's former territory . 
  pan-german nationalism , anti-semitism , eugenics and `` racial sciences '' were common and socially accepted concepts before hitler was even born . 
  the defeat in ww1 and subsequent humiliation created the perfect environment in which such philisophies could thrive . 
  who 's to say another `` f\u00fchrer '' would n't have risen instead ? 
  it happened all over europe at the time . 
  in my opinion , the rise of nazism and ww2 would have also happened without mustache-man as it 's figurehead . 
  but we will never know . 
  this is the common narrative , but let 's not forget that this small man with a mustache actually * hated * austria , banned the name , and wanted to exterminate it 's identity and history . 
  while he admired prussia and prussian culture and in many ways used them as a role-model for the nazis . 
  his only real connection to austria was that he was born there . 
  username definitely checks out . 
  called `` german dualism '' , this rivalry even has it 's own [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria%e2%80%93prussia_rivalry ) . 
  it effectively ended when prussia unified germany and kicked austria out . 
  it 's one of the reasons why , from time to time , you see some austrians still express a weird anti-german sentiment , even though most probably are n't aware of the historical reasons . 
  however , austria still exists today , while prussia does n't , so in that sense you could say we won in the end . 
  if there is a huge discrepancy between the two candidates it will become apparent quickly , and can be projected with reasonable accuracy . 
  currently it 's at 66 % to 34 % , which is incredibly decisive . 
   you do n't gain many concrete benefits except the right to vote . 
  if you think that 's not worth it , fine , but then also do n't complain about it . 
  it 's a fair choice : you can either remain a citizen of your country of birth and vote in the elections there , or if you want a say in the politics of your new country of choice , you can commit to it and pursue citizenship there . 
  if you are living in a country for years , yet do n't see the need or benefits of pursuing citizenship , then do n't be surprised if you 're not allowed to vote . 
   also we have the wolpetinger raurakl haa\u00dft des bei uns , oida !, 
  austrian word for couch is `` bankerl '' not `` polster '' . 
  i do n't think it will happen within our lifetime , so let 's enjoy our europe while it lasts eh ? 
  i honestly believe nation states as we know them now will disappear into the near or far future , one way or another . 
  the main 2 scenarios i can see are either . 
  * european nation states eventually form into one bigger federation , be it the eu or something else . 
  * total collapse of civilization due to overpopulation , lack of resources , war and global warming . 
  followed by either extinction of the human race , or the fomation of completely new countries from the ashes . 
  we do it , but only between male-female or female-female . 
  our word for it ( `` bussi '' ) also comes from french i believe . 
  i personally am not a fan of it though . 
  1918 worst year of life . 
  [ this is the american embassy ] ( http://www.msg-history.com/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.downloaditem&amp;g2_itemid=10029&amp;g2_serialnumber=13 ) in vienna ( could n't find a better picture ) . 
  pretty big and pompous building , but then again vienna is full of those , so it does n't really stand out . 
  i think by far the most impressive embassy we have is the [ french ] ( http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/02/05/45/69_big.jpg ) one, 
   it 's a fact austria was at least ( or even more ) as responsible for the nazi shit show as the germans were definitely agree there , i 'm just so sick of this lame old beethoven-hitler thing constantly spewed by ( predominantly ) muricans . 
  sounds like straight out of a ukip spot . 
  i think it 's still a very good comparison . 
  bavaria ( and austria for that matter ) definitely is to germany ( sauprei\u00dfn , piefken ) what the american south is to the north ( yankees ) . 
  the way you describe it , that whole scene looks really funny in my head . 
  i shook hands with a japanese woman and her hands were disgustingly stinky and sticky with sweat . 
  i 'm usually not even the fussy type , but for some reason it shocked me . 
  beethoven of course was n't austrian ( never seen anyone claim that ) , but hitler was most definitely german for all intents and purposes . 
  i personally do n't . 
  the dislike is typically limited to being annoyed at the way you talk . 
  i am viennese and we have tons of germans here , and not a very strong dialect ourselves , so most people here do n't care at all . 
  in the country a german will stick out much more , and some people may be annoyed but that 's it . 
  i suppose it is similar to the southerner/yankee and english/scottish relationships . 
  a mix of inferiority complex and at the same time proudness of your own language and heritage , being different for the sake of being different . 
  austria as a country is a very modern invention . 
  for most of it 's history , austria was the most powerful of german states . 
  that changed after prussia unified germany and formed the german empire without austria , but until 1945 , austrians still considered themselves ( and were considered ) german . 
  after 1945 the not-german-ness was pushed and propagated to distance themselves from germany , and an actual austrian national identity was formed . 
  hatred is definitely too strong wrong word , `` dislike '' is more appropriate . 
  yeah , you summed it up much better than me . 
  humor is one of those things where every nation will claim to be the most sarcastic and morbid . 
  it 's exactly the same with being the most drunk , most miserable , etc. 
  until you realize that really , everyone basically has the same humor and same stereotypes about their countrymen and neighbours . 
  it 's pretty universal across europe and probably the world . 
  same with being drunk and miserable , by the way . 
  funnily enough , normal leberk\u00e4se consists of neither cheese nor liver . 
  possibly , i 'd have to ask my grandma . 
  * paternal grandfather : manned a so-called [ flak tower ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flak_tower ) in vienna towards the end of the war , got hit on the head by a wayward artillery shell , declared invalid for the rest of the war . 
  * paternal grand-uncle : wounded somewhere on the eastern front ( around k\u00f6nigsberg / kaliningrad ) , died on hospital ship in the baltic sea , when it was sunk by the americans ( ? ) . 
  * paternal great-grand-uncle was an illegal nazi before 1938 , member of nsdap , later sa . 
  died somewhere in the balkans , ( allegedly ) killed by tito 's partisans . 
  * maternal great-grandfather : all i know is he was russian prisoner of war for a time . 
  * other maternal great-grandfather : was in the fascist hungarian army , presumably died somewhere on the eastern front against russia . 
  i think india was pretty much only brought up in context to european history . 
  we learned that : * alexander the great 's conquests stopped at india , and the indus marked the easternmost border of his empire . 
  * the cirumnavigation of africa and the discovery of the americas were driven by efforts to find better routes to india and china . 
  * the british colonial empire , which of course included india , and it 's subsequent decline . 
  i believe we did learn about gandhi . 
  assuming you 're indian , what did you learn about europe and it 's individual countries besides maybe the things i just listed ? 
  my country had no overseas colonies to speak of . 
  however , the `` sense of brotherhood because of shared history '' part is very applicable to the former countries of the habsburg empire ( i cri evrytiem ) , like hungary , czechia , slovakia , slovenia , etc. 
  although that feeling may not always be mutual , i like to think we still have some things in common . 
  in many ways i feel closer to them than to western/northern europe and even germany . 
  exactly the same in austria , we have `` heast '' , which is dialect for `` h\u00f6rst ( du ) '' . 
  romanians , albanians , jugoslavs and turks . 
  romanians have the best reputation , while turks are the most numerous . 
  i learned italian in school and it served me decently well in italy . 
  however i have n't used it for so long that i could n't hold a real conversation nowadays . 
  * generally you take off your shoes after you step in and leave them in the `` vorzimmer '' ( entrance hall/corridor , literally `` pre-room '' ) . 
  some house owners may permit shoes on the first floor , but never in an apartment . 
  * i think being loud and interrupting is considered rude pretty much everywhere , especially as a guest , so this is kind of a no-brainer .
