  it 's how i see it anyway . 
  what the actually vote for i have no idea , but i imagine they heavily vote socialist , so in that sense they are n't really conservative . 
  this is a sub to ask europeans about their stance on various topics . 
  i do n't see why this question is worse than any other . 
  if i cared about the champions league ( which i do n't ) , i 'd actually also be interested to know if there are any americans who know of it/watch it . 
  clearly op did n't assume everybody knows it , otherwise he would n't have explained what it is in his post . 
  i just learned about it through some weird imgur memes ( i know , i know ... ) . 
  generally , i think college sport is pretty much nonexistent in europe , and there is also little interest/knowledge for american college sport . 
  was fishing once as a 11 year old . 
  almost died of boredom , and caught 1 tiny fish . 
  never was hunting . 
  i do n't generally have a problem with the killing itself , but i really dislike the whole culture , theatrics and machismo surrounding hunting . 
  it 's kind of obnoxious and backwards in my opinion . 
  so that 's why i 'll almost certainly never get into it . 
  germany , or if that does n't count , italy . 
  no , and i do n't understand why anyone would do this . 
  i usually wear fresh socks except in summer . 
  how does a bracelet help against sunburn ? 
  and why only in march ? 
  is it like a balcanic tradition or something ? 
  usually we are slumped together with bavaria and switzerland for a general `` alpine german '' stereotype with lederhosen , dirndl , gamsbart , alphorn and ma\u00dfkrug . 
  sometimes in a story a nazi will be austrian , he is generally the most evil of all . 
  i have never shot or handled one . 
  i may one day , but currently i have no interest or energy to acquire a license in the foreseeable future . 
  since i live in the city , i could n't do anything with it anyway . 
  it would mostly be a waste of time , space and money . 
  the mainstream parties calling themselves `` christians '' are typically just moderate ( sometimes not-so-moderate ) conservatives . 
  the actual fundamentalist christian parties are mostly very minor parties . 
  this is not a purely american/english-speaking thing . 
  i have a hungarian last name which has become ` germanized ' , and i do n't see using the germanized version as mispronouncing the name at all . 
  using the original pronounciation instead of the current one feels weird and wrong . 
  i think the same can be applied for ` anglicized ' names . 
  leopold , duke of austria fought in the 3rd crusade . 
  according to legend , there was one siege where the fighting was so fierce , his formerly white coat of arms turned completely red , except for the small strip where his belt was . 
  funnily , this story also somewhat relates to england : king richard lionheart also fought in this battle , and later got into an argument with duke leopold , about flags or some nonsense . 
  leopold was so offended that he abandoned the crusade and went back home . 
  i 'm not sure how well known this story is in england but later , when richard returned to europe , he was captured in austria by leopold , delivered to the holy roman emperor , and spent a few years in captivity . 
  it has no fancy name , but makes up for it with a badass origin story . 
  i actually have a small vietnamese restaurant in my street and get takeaway there sometimes , but i have never seen this dish there . 
  most people just eat noodles/rice with meat . 
  i was born just after the curtain fell , so i personally do n't really qualify . 
  that said , my hungarian grandfather fled to austria in the late 50 's , and often talks about how shitty and depressing it was there , especially his time in the army . 
  of course he was n't the only one , and most hungarian/czechoslovak escapees ( for lack of a better word ) told similar stories . 
  also , both my parents tell stories of how they walked up close to the heavily defended and guarded czechoslovak/hungarian border as a dare , and how imposing and scary it was . 
  it was basically mordor . 
  i 'd say generally , the warsaw pact was perceived very negatively , maybe even * worse * than life there actually was , because of course the communists were n't the only ones heavily using propaganda . 
  pretty shitty apparently . 
  * [ kaiser franz joseph ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_joseph_i_of_austria ) , under whose rule austria-hungary was in steady decline , and who arguably started ww1 . 
  the habsburgs in general are viewed by some as inbreeding despots , by others as a nostalgic symbol for a time when austria ruled over an empire and was more relevant in general . 
  * [ engelbert dollfuss ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/engelbert_dollfuss ) , who ruled austria as dictator before being murdered by the nazis in a failed coup attempt , and [ kurt schuschnigg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurt_schuschnigg ) , his successor who maintained the regime until overthrown by the nazis in a * successful * coup , and was even thrown into concentration camp . 
  they were pretty much fascists like mussolini , but due to the fact that they vehemently opposed hitler and fought for a sovereign austria , they are sometimes stylized as heroes . 
  * uncle adolf , who i think needs no introduction . 
  a general `` eh , he was n't all bad '' - mentality persists among many people , especially older and conservative/right wing , and i daresay it is more socially acceptable than in germany . 
  i wish . 
  `` bruda '' , `` kollege '' or `` oida '' , depending on their austrianization . 
  do n't wear shirts with stylized eagles on them if you can avoid it . 
  over the course of history , many nations , peoples and empires have held themselves to be exceptional , superior and different to all the rest , destined for greater things , etc. 
  the usa are n't the first country to hold this belief , and are n't the last . 
  compare with , for example : * the concepts of virtus and romanitas in ancient rome * sinocentrism in china * master race-ideology in nazi germany the perceived superiority / exceptionalism comes from different sources , depending on the country . 
  sometimes it 's race or ethnicity , sometimes it 's culture or philosphy . 
  for the usa i think it 's mainly political and philosphical in nature , because the national identity is very strongly tied to to concepts of freedom , democracy and capitalism . 
  of course , if we think of the word `` exceptional '' as simply `` unique '' , i would say that the usa are definitely a country with a very unique history and place in the world , more so than most other countries . 
  if you compare them globally , most eu countries are pretty much peaceful * utopias * . 
  especially western european countries and especially sweden ( and the rest of scandinavia ) . 
  a few ghettos full of unpleasant muslim retards wo n't change that fact any time soon . 
  i think op clearly meant `` apologism '' as `` being sorry '' , even if the wrong word was used . 
  as an austrian ( basically german in this context ) , i do n't feel any guilt or the need to apologize for a war my great-grandparents ' generation started . 
  however , i think it is important that the holocaust and other atrocities commited by the third reich be thaught in school and remembered by all generations in germany & austria . 
  slowly but surely , the last contemporary witnesses to this time are dying out , so remembering the atrocities to make sure they do n't happen again will be more important than ever . 
  the germans that * do * feel the need to apologize are very sincere and in-fact often self-loathing . 
  the ones that are n't sorry at all and are in fact proud of their past are usually very blunt about it . 
  i personally do n't like coffe very much , but viennese coffee houses are a big part of viennese culture with a long tradition , and are recognized as a unesco cultural heritage . 
  allegedly it was started after the ottoman siege of vienna in 1683 , with the beans looted from the ottoman camp . 
  of course nowadays cheaper coffee from machines , starbucks etc. 
  is also ubiquitous , as in probably every other western country . 
  arguably the most significant nation/culture in ( western ) history . 
  i know little about contemporary greece , but overall i imagine it to be fairly similar to other mediterranean countries i 've been to . 
  alright alright i never was much of a sports person ok ? 
  who would even want a shitty plate without our glorious stars ? 
  not very popular . 
  i think american football is much bigger and has a better shot at becoming a mainstream sport ( although both probably never will ) . 
  unless i specifically ask for corrections , yes i would mind . 
  it is kind of rude to be honest . 
  goulash outside of hungary is more similar to p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt , i think . 
  personally , my favourite hungarian dish is l\u00e1ngos . 
  wake up around 9:00 . 
  depending on the day , go to work or study/pretend to study . 
  do n't eat anything all day until ~ 16 pm . 
  play with cat , browse reddit , read a book , play video games , watch dumb stuff on youtube . 
  occasionally shower and shave . 
  browse reddit on phone in bed , staying up way too late . 
  upon employment , you automatically become elligible for insurance and healthcare . 
  of course it 's not really `` free '' , it is included in your monthly taxes , but you do n't have to actively do or pay anything additional for it . 
  in my country , `` america '' and `` american '' generally denotes the us and it 's citizens . 
  when talking about the continent you 'd use `` north america '' , `` south america '' or `` american continent '' . 
  exactly , i bet every country with a so-called [ primate city ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_primate_cities ) has this . 
  often islam is cited as the main difference . 
  but i actually see no problem with a moderate , secular islamic country joining the eu . 
  sadly , turkey seems to head in the opposite direction currently . 
  same reason most people in the eu are against turkey joining .
