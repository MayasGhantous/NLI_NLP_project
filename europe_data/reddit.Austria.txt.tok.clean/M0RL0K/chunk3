  i ca n't find any country in their colors on the map . 
  you can ? 
  that 's nice richo , i 'm sure your parents are very proud of you . 
  so if you are not a hateful , bigoted nationalist , it means you want islam to grow ? 
  got it . 
  lol `` dinarid '', 
  of course , got ta make everything about `` muh rapefugees '' right ? 
  your flair says `` slovenia '' . 
  how could you possibly be up to date about wether new mosques are being built in britain ? 
  huh . 
  * mountains * not hills , thank you very much . 
  i 'm surprisingly non-triggered by this map . 
  austria can into relevance . 
  learned a thing or two from the russians after all huh ? 
  you and me all count as germans for them . 
  for something completely different or chaos fans , i recommend the fantastic * soul hunter * and sequels . 
  gw is very pro-israel , so this would n't be far-fetched actaully . 
  these always creep me the fuck out . 
  uncanny valley . 
  not sure why this is special , you can see such graffiti on most blocks in every major european city , especially germany/austria . 
  everyone , take a good look at op 's history . 
  i do n't mean to defend such a horrible act , and of course the perpetrators should be punished harshly but ... if you are really desperate you would do anything for money . 
  and i could be completely wrong here , but feel a person must be very desperate to do something crazy like this . 
  a single horn can be worth a lot . 
  only true 1000 ad kids will remember this !, 
  probably slavic/hungarian influence . 
  exactly what i 'm always thinking . 
  from portugal to ukraine these `` traditional clothings '' all superficially look kind of similar . 
  i 'm not sure if i should count myself to the 9 % or not . 
  i 'm from vienna and learned it in school . 
  although i probably ca n't hold a real conversation nowadays . 
  1920 never forget . 
  i thought brits are the only ones who call those things chips . 
  looks delicious , but i do n't consider the ones on the left `` sandwiches '' at all . 
  i 'm pretty sure `` oranda '' is simply japanese trying to pronounce `` holland '' . 
  does n't sauce over the schnitzel completely ruin the crispness ? 
  might as well not bread and fry the meat at all . 
  the native name is `` crna gora '' , which is a direct translation of `` montenegro '' , which both mean `` black mountain ( s ) '' . 
  the montenegrin language is a dialect of serbo-croatian , and mutually intelligible with the other variations . 
  at least what i heard , i do n't speak the language . 
  why is that ? 
  the domesticated turkey is usually called `` pute '' in german . 
  i 'm pretty sure at no point in history austria lay * northwest * of bavaria ? 
  it did n't even exist in 814 . 
  is this map just weird or was there actually a different political entity with that name at the name ? 
  i 'd rather not ... 
  a childhood without asterix & obelix must be a very sad one . 
  verleihnix ( ordralfab\u00e9tix ) literally means `` lends-nothing '' , which i actually find quite fitting for that character . 
  not really . 
  the last foreign currency i handled were polish z\u0142oty , which felt the same as euro to me . 
  ca n't comment on danish crowns , but i think overall they look very similar to euros in design . 
  we have a coastline now ? 
  i 'm ok with that . 
  the relation between germany and austria can be compared to the english and scots , or yankees and southerners . 
  you sure you do n't mean * k\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz * ? 
  in german it 's called * fachwerkhaus * . 
  how is sinterklaas racist ? 
  if anything that would be zwarte piet . 
  my country is spot on though . 
  vienna is baltimore ? 
  could be worse i guess ... 
  i have to be completely honest , i had no idea hungary shares a border with ukraine . 
  even slovenians themselves confuse their country with slovakia ? 
  impressive . 
  this dude had a very interesting life . 
  rightly so because it 's a stupid comment . 
  i eat the whole apple without any leftovers . 
  skin core , seeds , stalk . 
  ukraine has the most beautiful in my opinion . 
  i 've never heard of this guy . 
  this whole thing feels like a south park episode . 
  do n't know what everyone is on about . 
  yes the wording is a bit clumsy , but you can still perfectly understand what is meant . 
  also : til why all eu passports look so similar . 
  always wondered why they are all the same wine red . 
  it became an official name because using the erroneous reference became so widespread and commonly accepted . 
  not the first time this happened in history and wo n't be the last time . 
  first commenter , you are apparently shadowbanned, 
  the situation is similar to netherlands/holland and uk/england in that the biggest/most prominent region is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the whole country . 
  that the names are very similar in czech and one is derived from the other does n't change the fact that czechia = / = bohemia . 
  that 's funny coming from a dutch flair . 
  calling czechia `` bohemia '' is a bit like calling the netherlands `` holland '' , or the uk `` england '' . 
  then what is the alternative ? 
  small , insignificant countries bickering amongst each other and fading into obscurity while being overtaken by asia ? 
  because in the long term that is what will happen . 
  you 're right , apparently they are . 
  although technically both get beat by italy/vatican . 
  exactly and same goes for tschechei . 
  by `` always tschechien '' i mean it 's called that since 1993 , i.e. 
  when the country was formed . 
  afaik , vienna and bratislava are the world 's closest capitals . 
  you can drive between them in less than 1 hour . 
  what was the reason for calling it `` czech republic '' in some languages in the first place ? 
  in german it was always `` tschechien '' . 
  edit : alright not always , but tschechien is the official name since the country 's formation in the 90 's . 
  you could make the same map for germany or france and it would look similar . 
  let 's be honest , both are pretty spot on . 
  because the sight of blacks is revolting to their pure , aryan eyes , duh . 
  exactly , they pretty much just do n't care all that much . 
  and overall , a good global image by being racially inclusive is probably more important to the company .
