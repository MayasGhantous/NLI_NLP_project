  the cakes look all the same to me . 
  mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu already proclaimed austria `` racism capital of the world '' earlier this year . 
  i get the feeling he just likes to talk a lot of shit . 
  the young dude looks more hungarian , true . 
  either way the other guy is austria because these 2 very cearly represent the k. u. k. monarchy . 
  pretty sure the old dude is hungary , not romania . 
  i 'd like to see a credible source on that . 
  it has strong symbolic value though . 
  it deliberately shows the whole island of cyprus underneath an olive branch to promote peace and unity between the greek and turkish population . 
  do n't know your jelincic guy , but from what i read about him , he is the slovenian version of haider/strache . 
  both xenophobic , nationalist , anti-eu populists . 
  yeah i think most of us on / r/europe know this guy by now . 
  slovenia invading and conquering * k\u00e4rnten * back from austria is about as likely as austria invading and conquering s\u00fcdtirol from italy . 
  in both cases , there are some delusional idiots and nationalists who think it will happen one day , but the truth of the matter is , most people in both countries do not give a fuck . 
  look at his comments . 
  this guy is notorious for being a slavic nationalist and putinbot . 
  amazing how little button-pushing it takes for people like you to show their true colors . 
  meh , i think i 'll continue to call it k\u00e4rnten . . and while i 'm at it , i will also refer to ljubljana as * laibach * from now on . 
  well , it 's most definitely k\u00e4rnten now . 
  but your `` free peasants '' are of course free to call it whatever they like . 
  actually , it 's called k\u00e4rnten . 
  looks really unprofessional and is worded weirdly . 
  actually looks like satire . 
  on the other hand , seeing this in carinthia would n't terribly surprise me . 
  maybe letting you guys go independent might not be such a good idea after all ... 
  it 's ridiculous in a * good way * . 
  as if the ~ ~ catalonian ~ ~ catalan christmas log was n't ridiculous enough , it literally [ shits presents ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ti%c3%b3_de_nadal ) . 
  which is exactly what the europeans also did ( or are trying to do ) . 
  i see no reason why future turkish generations ca n't do the same as well . 
  i 'm confused . 
  well i can see your point , but i do not agree with it . 
  what is `` christian cultural background '' to you then ? 
  well i ( i 'm catholic btw ) do know quite a few practicing muslim bosnians , and their `` mindset '' is completely european . 
  honestly who cares what religion their ancestors 400 years ago had ? 
  many european nations that brutally oppressed and killed each other for centuries are now each other 's closest allies in the eu . 
  if reconciliation between these countries is possible , i do n't see why it ca n't be possible with turkey in the future , especially when ( hopefully ) religion becomes a less and less important political factor . 
  and by the way , i fail to see how the fuck this has to do with `` white guilt '' . 
  i 'd like to see a source for your claims . 
  and i still fail what that has to do with the question of wether styria should belong to slovenia or not . 
  nope , istanbul is larger . 
  what about albania and bosnia then , where over 50 % of the population are muslims . 
  are they not europeans ? 
  my bad . 
  of course istanbul is n't the capital . 
  pre-erdogan turkey was ( and in some respects still is ) more progressive than some eu countries . 
  ~ ~ the capital ~ ~ istanbul is europe 's largest city . 
  the ottomans ruled a large chunk of europe for 400 years and are part of europe 's history . 
  secular and moderate islam is no different or more threatening than christianity . 
  the path of that turkey chose in recent years is lamentable , but many europeans seem to think that turkey is inherently incompatible with the eu and europe , and i personally do n't believe that . 
  that 's pretty much what i said . 
  i was just pointing out to op that both sides of the border had/have sizable german/slovenian minorities . 
  but the reason they voted that was n't `` we are ethnic swiss suppressed by austria '' , it was more like `` new austria sucks '' . 
  and in the end the swiss themselves did n't want them . 
  in the same vein , bohemia and vorarlberg are two separate things . 
  bohemia was czech people under austrian rule . 
  but vorarlberg was never `` swiss people under austrian rule '' . 
  completely different situations . 
  i am aware . 
  but that does n't necessarily mean vorarlberg is , or ever was , part of historic switzerland . 
  exactly !, 
  because there was absolutely no basis or reason for that referendum in the first place . 
  the western part was mostly part of the frankish empire . 
  the eastern parts were under the rule of various slavic and other nomadic peoples , like the moravians and avars . 
  that does n't mean vorarlberg is rightfully swiss . 
  it was never part of the original eidgenossenschaft . 
  the only reason they voted for that is because everyone at the time hated the new austrian state and wanted to get out . 
  that does n't make it more swiss . 
  vorarlberg was under austrian rule for over 600 years . 
  the slovenes are a recongnized minority in austria . 
  the same ca n't be said for the ethnic german-austrians of lower styria ( now northern slovenia ) , who were all but expelled and are to this day not recognized by slovenia . 
  if anything , carinthia is more slovenian than styria . 
  they even tried to [ conquer it after ww1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-slovene_conflict_in_carinthia ) . 
  the only one you actually got right is the burgenland . 
  gib clay back italy !, 
   the real danger is not the veil -- it poses no threat -- but the bigotry of those who 've made it a symbol of their own fear and hate . 
  there are 2 sides to this coin . 
  the full-face-veil ( or burqa or whatever is the difference ) is also a symbol of a backward , misogynistic and dogmatic form of islam . 
  i think it is not unreasonable , racist or `` bigoted '' at all for educated europeans to be firmly opposed to it . 
  i 'm pretty sure no one has ever said that word out loud . 
  `` bundespr\u00e4sidentenwahlwiederholung '' would be completely sufficient . 
  seems to me they made up the word specifically for this contest to make it more interesting/funny . 
  holy shit , i loved the mumins as a kid . 
  have n't heard of them in ages . 
  somewhat ironic that braunau of all places voted vdb . 
  i expected vorarlberg to be smaller on that map tbh . 
  and do n't forget they are all cucks , homos and muslims . 
  if there existed such a thing as `` austro-hungarian bloc '' , i do n't see why croatia would n't be part of it . 
  it 's funny ... austrians ( especially viennese ) say exactly the same thing of themselves . 
  i honestly think it 's pretty much the same all over the world . 
  being miserable and talking about how shitty everything and everyone else is seems to be a `` national pastime '' no matter where you live . 
  no it is n't . 
  there is almost no snow , especially around christmas . 
  i wonder if `` obese '' means the same as `` overweight '' for the purpose of this report . 
  how is it a straw man ? 
  you literally said you want to close all borders and do n't care what happens to the people outside . 
  of course the current situation is not perfect . 
  i completely agree that we are getting too many immigrants too fast . 
  but i think far-right ideologies and their `` us vs them '' - mentality are just as dangerous to europe 's future . 
  so you want to live in a fortress surrounded by barbed wire and ignore the problems of the rest fo the world forever ? 
  you think that is the direction europe should take ?
