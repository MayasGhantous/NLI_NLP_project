  and i do n't see how poland-lithuania is relevant to this . 
  i 'm sorry if this offends your national pride or whatever but the potato stereotype comes from the much more recent soviet era , during which , let 's be honest , the baltics were one giant shithole . 
  poor country with cold climate = potato . 
  that 's really all there is to it . 
  not surprising . 
  i think the potato jokes about various ethnicities ( irish , baltics , belarusians and probably more ) are because potatoes are a typical `` poor man 's food '' and often during bad times there was little else to eat in those countries . 
  is it just the terrain or is there a reason wallonia has so few inhabitants compared to flanders ? 
  everyone knows finland is the balls of europe . 
  which makes the baltics the taint ... fitting if you ask me . 
  puts in perspective how crazy close together everything is up there . 
  the benelux states together cover slightly less total area than austria , but have almost 4x the population . 
  damn that 's flat . 
  my bad . 
  i personally think it 's a more interesting and worthwile topic than all the lame christmas market/winter pictures . 
  because let 's be honest , you 've seen one , you 've seen them all . 
   an empire ruled by [ potatoes ] ( http://www.potato.es/wp-content/uploads/potato-slider.png ) . 
  ftfy, 
  it 's just a meme at this point . 
  do n't think that 's going anywhere . 
  both presidential candidates are from different parties than the ruling government ( i.e. 
  the ones who decided on this embargo ) . 
  it 's not `` hardcore hate '' , it 's simply politics . 
  the way erdogan and the turkish government have conducted themselves the past few months , i think it 's only fair there are some consequences to their actions and words ( although it 's largely symbolic anyway and probably does n't have real economic impact on either country ) . 
  we do n't have a `` right wing gov '' . 
  our chancellor is a social democrat . 
  not at all suprised that most austrians are a closer genetically to our slavic/hungarian brothers than to the germans . 
  still pretty cool and interesting to see . 
  although some people somewhere probably do n't like it . 
  if anything , vienna would surrender * you * , not the other way around . 
  pannonia would be a more fitting name though , imo . 
  what i like about op 's map is that this format allows for overlap . 
  germany is western + central , baltics are northern + eastern etc. 
  most accurate map yet , i completely agree with it . 
  i could n't find any reliable information on this family and their status anywhere in austrian media . 
  so my guess is that their story is like these stories always go : they arrive here ain hopes for a better life , and file an asylum application . 
  while it 's pending , they make themselves at home , integrate ( or not ) and think they 're safe . 
  then comes the rude awakening when the application gets denied , and they either have to leave or are forcefully removed . 
  it sucks , but i do n't see a better solution . 
  it 's the only way i see to even attempt to manage the mass influx of refugees . 
  `` but he 's such a nice guy and look how sad he is '' simply is n't reason enough . 
  * what if the usa elected an educated , reasonable , charismatic man for president ? 
  * * what if china suddenly became a democracy and upholder of human rights ? 
  * * what if every country on earth banded together and worked towards a common goal of peace , prosperity , and preservation of earth ? 
  * these hypothetical questions are nice , but completely pointless , and have nothing to do with the reality we live in . 
  the hell is a rakousko ? 
  i do n't think that will help with the pain from what he is suggesting to you . 
  it stands for ** donau city ** actually . 
  ca n't wait for this meme to die . 
  apart from that fyrom thing , greece does n't usually partake in the typical balkan squabbles so i exclude them . 
  meanwhile , albanian nationalists claim they are illyrians which makes them the only natives in the region ... 
  looks just like the hipster kids in my neighborhood . 
  a strong eu and strong individual nations are not mutually exclusive . 
  in fact , they go hand in hand . 
  that 's clearly not vienna . 
  oddly specific ... 
  it 's . . different . 
  i 'd like to try it . 
  also because for our size , the population density is pretty low by european standards . 
  [ scumbags of europe !,

  and some just like to watch the world burn ( literally ) .

  poland truly is the future of western civilization . 
  poles ? 
  trumpets all over the world eat that shit up . 
  simple words for simple minds . 
  trumps specialty . 
  i 'm down . 
  let 's make rome great again !, 
  well played , luigi . 
  in that case s\u00fcdtirol would be ours in a week . 
  how is he `` articulate '' ? 
  he provided no solutions or any offerings of assistance with the migrant crisis or terrorism , neither of which even affect poland . 
  he simply said what those gullible idiots want to hear . 
  a bit of fear-mongering and eu-bashing here , a bit of `` poland stronk '' - ing there . 
  of course the poles with their collective inferiority complex are gon na eat that shit up . 
  pretty sure it 's named after [ these guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pandur ) . 
  you are not the hero this sub needs , but the one it deserves . 
  no , because for most of it 's history , austria was one of many german states , just like in italy you had savoy , naples , venice etc. . 
  when a-h broke up , most people wanted to join germany ( weimar republik ) , but it was prevented by the allies . 
  an actual austrian national identity only really developed after ww2 . 
  being a separate country was convenient at the time because it allowed to shift the blame for nazism on germany alone . 
  there are a few important people in our history of course , but i 'd say they are viewed differently than in most other countries . 
  you hit the nail on the head with all your points . 
  the winners of ww1 & ww2 . 
  it sounds good in hindsight , but pan-slavic as well as pan-germanic sentiments were way too strong at the time . 
  garibaldi looking kind of droopy there . 
  ridiculous nonsense . 
  the defense minister is a social democrat . 
  our far-right party has zero to do with this , and have no say in it . 
  what the fuck are we even gon na do with 750 men . 
  it was sarcasm . 
  i see you have it all figured out ... 
  yep , that 's all . 
  your hollow phrases and this picture fully convinced me . 
  all hail god-emperors putin & trump . 
  and now with the trumpisms . 
  love it . 
  and how exactly would we `` pay '' , may i ask ?
