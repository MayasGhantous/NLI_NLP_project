  the picture is beautiful , if you had posted it without that stupid title it would 've gotten a lot better reception . 
  but sadly you chose to expose yourself for the putinbot you are . 
  first picture is paris under nazi occupation . 
  * cries in austrian *, 
  way too detailed and complicated from a vexillological standpoint . 
  pretty standard for the time of construction . 
  [ greek revival ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_revival_architecture ) was all the rage . 
  this was also the seat of parliament of austria-hungary . 
  this so-called * reichsrat * was basically a massive , ineffectual shitshow of everyone ( german-austrians , hungarians , czechs , croats , etc. ), 
  shouting at each other in their native language , and intentionally stalling/sabotaging any efforts at decisionmaking . 
  it must have been incredible to watch . 
  that the parents are desperate and heartbroken over this is of course completely understandable and justified . 
  saying they `` sentenced him to death '' is unfair and sensationalistic . 
  they made this decision with the * child 's * interests in mind , not the * parents * interests . 
  further reading reveals that the echr actually delayed the decision to turn off life support , reviewed the case , and came to the conclusion that the doctors and judges in the uk made the correct choice , which is to spare the child further suffering . 
  but central europe * has n't * shown much solidarity , did they ? 
  when v4 disregarded the refugee quote they justified it with `` doing what 's best for their country '' . 
  so why ca n't germany do the same ? 
  i think it 's a good quick explanation for someone who might be wondering why a lot of european languages have similar-sounding words and sentence-structures , especially compared to the rest of the world . 
  that 's not what it says here . 
  it says most european languages have a common ancestor ( indo-european ) . 
  i agree in the sense that christianity and greco-roman culture , ideas and values are undoubtedly the biggest influences and main common denominators in the formation of an over-arching * european culture * . 
  to be fair , if you have his money and power you probably do n't care . 
  since it 's from a catholic german ( austrian ) perspective , probably has to do with the thirty years ' war . 
  i think it 's a different version of [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/v%c3%b6lkertafel_ ( steiermark \\ ) ) , so it 's from austria . 
  yes , i know about indo-europeans and all that jazz . 
  as i already said , this is a legal case . 
  the eu ca n't make you take refugees , but it can make you pay a price for it . 
  v4 failed to uphold a legally binding agreement , specifically [ this one ] ( http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-v-area-of-freedom-security-and-justice/chapter-2-policies-on-border-checks-asylum-and-immigration/346-article-78.html ) , and now they face the consequences . 
  i do n't see how this is different from any other democracy . 
  the numbers of refugees v4 would have to take are a fucking joke . 
  like a drop in a bucket , you would n't even notice it . 
  hell , i do n't even notice anything , and my country has already taken more refugees than yours would have had to . 
  and this is why the eu is incapable of deciding on any common policy and has trouble handling this crisis . 
  decisions agreed upon by the parliament simply get * ignored * for over a year , then when the eu acts , everyone cries about `` undemocratic eu '' . 
  you do n't get to fucking cherry pick the best bits of eu and ignore the rest without consequences ? 
  big shocker . 
  wether `` rightfully '' or not is n't the question here . 
  this is about violating an agreement and being held accountable . 
  you expect the rest of eu to just say `` ah whatever it 's fine guys '' ? 
  v4 agreed to vote on a democratic process that would be binding for all members . 
  vote did n't go in their favor , v4 said `` fuck that '' , and now face the consequences . 
  it 's a simple legal dispute , has nothing to do with disdain . 
  and look where it got him . 
  clearly this is a fringe opinion among `` elites '' . 
  should the eu fail , it will be * despite * brexit , not * because of it * . 
  they were replaced by migrants from the middle east , duh . 
  one year old statement that has been universally regarded as ridiculous hyberbole ? 
  very convincing . 
  `` diversity '' is such a stupid fucking strawman . 
  no one is seriously advocating for immigration or better integration policies because of `` diversity '' . 
   so gay and peaceful, 
  you do n't say ? 
  we killed gustav adolf ... 
   assuming that all those arrests were made without evidence is n't much less ridiculous that 's not what i was implying . 
  it could mean a good thing , but it also could mean that the amount of radicalized youths is above average , which would be a bad thing . 
  is there any comfirmation of a foiled terror attack here ? 
  if not , could be simple coincidence . 
  arrests = / = convictions, 
  i suggest downvoting . 
  i have often asked myself ... if i had lived in the 3rd reich , would i have resisted the german regime ? 
  gone underground ? 
  and i came to the conclusion : nope . 
  i would have been a good little nazi . 
  and so would have been most others . 
  not sure why you 're telling me this , i never denied it ? 
  violent attacks by neo nazis are hardly * legal prosecution * . 
  he 's a flair-less 7 day old user ... come on now . 
  yes , it sounds really stupid and unfitting , imo . 
  this is why we * need * the eu . 
  only by banding together can europe assert itself , sort out it 's problems , and effectively face the upcoming challenges . 
  it 's no different than when american rednecks rant about `` swedistan '' or something similar anywhere else on reddit . 
  people wo have no idea about the conditions nor any solutions to the problems offering their `` expertise '' . 
  that said , from what we hear about it , you ca n't deny turkey seems to slowly become an abomination . 
  and you apparently already left and resignated as well . 
  what is your solution to your countries problems ? 
  how would you fix turkey , op ? 
  alright , let 's do it . 
  you start . 
  i do n't know what to tell you ... sadly , you will probably have to deal with discrimination and `` profiling '' as long as you are here . 
  you can thank your countrymen as well as native european bigots for that in equal measure . 
  but if you do n't have ties to religious organizations , what do you have to fear ? 
  legal prosecution solely based on nationality and appearance is ( thankfully ) not a thing here and wo n't be anytime soon . 
  deleted post said `` muslims are the main victims of islamic terrorism '' as if that absolved all muslims and put them above scrutiny . 
  i do n't understand what you 're trying to say . 
  that 's the spirit ... join the dark side . 
  i gave you one of my abundant downvotes for talking about downvotes . 
  that 's exactly what a zoo is . 
  a mix between safari and museum . 
  they could , but who 's gon na pay for these ominous * other places * ? 
  amazon prime . 
  no , but actively advocating * against * anti-nazi protests as a german would be considered controversial . 
  you yourself were comparing germans , a nationality , to muslims , a religion . 
  does n't exactly hold up either . 
  [ you jelly ? 
  ] ( http://wetter.orf.at/oes/ ), 
  muslims are also the main perpetrators of islamic terrorism , are n't they ? 
  in any case it 's how they are * perceived * by the public eye . 
  you ca n't deny that over the last decades muslims have become more and more unpopular , distrusted and feared . 
  wether justified or not is irrelevant .
