  the ship of * not being stigmatized * has objectively sailed . 
  it 's a [ star wars meme/copypasta ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/prequelmemes/comments/5q3du8/did_you_ever_hear_the_tragedy_of_darth_plagueis/ ) , and i 'm 80 % sure op used the wording on purpose . 
  why are you ranting off immediately about anti-white agenda in a thread about catholic traditions ? 
  i partook in similar traditions as a child and yet i do n't believe and never believed in god . 
  this has nothing to do with indoctrination . 
   but some groups say it stigmatises muslims ... 
  i think * that * ship has sailed . 
  not sure censorship is the right way to tackle this issue ... 
  not a story the soviets would tell you ... 
  predictably , this thread will attract both edgy atheists and alt-righters who have to make everything about muh rapefugees . 
  i think the contrast between czech rep. and slovakia is particularly interesting . 
  the region vienna-bratislava is basically almost one metro area at this point . 
  bratislava is one of a few cities on your list i have been to as well , and i think it 's a very nice city . 
  did you have a particular bad experience or did you just find it boring / ugly ? 
  and as a viennese , how did you like it there ? 
  rank your experiences in each country from best to worst ? 
  fake news !, 
  huh ? 
  different how ? 
  the mindset of insisting on free speech ( muh amendmentz ) whenever you say something dumb and get called out most definitely originated in america . 
  while the article actually makes some sense verhofstadt has said plenty of wrong or stupid shit before . 
  he 's not always the sharpest tool in the shed . 
  i thought you had better things to do ? 
  anyway , this tactic predates the alt-right or trump . 
  it 's been going on for decades . 
  well then , pick your fucking words more carefully next time . 
   no , i 'm not doing that . 
  disagreeing does n't mean telling someone not to speak their mind . 
  * telling * someone not to speak their mind is different from * making * them . 
  this is the key here . 
  telling them is disagreeing ( be it through insults or a constructive response with arguments is irrelevant ) . 
  forcefully making them , that is suppression and censorship . 
   and if my nationality is relevant here , it 's because americans blabla . . no it is relevant because , as i said in another comment this is the typical right-wing tactic now , carried over to here from america . 
  everything said is justified by free speech , and speaking up is immediately `` censorship '' or even better `` liberal tears '' . 
  it 's the typical right-wing tactic now , carried over to here from america . 
  everything said is justified by free speech , and speaking up is `` censorship '' or `` liberal tears '' . 
  so you are literally equating censorship and disagreement . 
  so your original post would read :  i do n't think anyone should disagree with her just for defending her position . 
  sounds pretty fucking stupid , does n't it ? 
  i have a problem with carelessly abusing and misusing words . 
  that 's what you call censoring ? 
  yes , this is , as i already said , voicing disagreement . 
  perfectly acceptable . 
  same here . 
  it seems like almost half of eu countries are losing their government currently , one way or another . 
  but i specifically attacked his nationality because it is relevant to the topic . 
  the irony is , this is basically exactly what / u/nrcx is advocating here . 
  and that 's exactly what i did in the first place . 
  so by your definition people saying `` i think what you said should n't ever be said in that place '' is censoring . 
  you 're not attempting to * censor * me , are you ? 
  i am usually against the usa bashing in this sub but this comment is the perfect example how to deflect any criticism on basis of `` free speech '' and cry `` censoring '' or whatever . 
  and i hate * this mindset * . 
   that 's just `` shut up '' in so many needless words . 
  what do you mean needless ? 
  this is commonly used rhetoric to express strong disagreement , nothing more . 
  has 0 to do with censoring . 
   it 's hardly outrageous for a pm to defend her own position . 
  the outrage comes from the * context * of where it was said ( auschwitz ) , perceived as inappropriate for the time and place . 
  i know what it is , but ours do n't look as shitty . 
  typical american `` muh free spech '' comment . 
  who is censoring anything here ? 
  of course she 's free to say what she said , but at the same time others are free to critizice and strongly voice their disagreement , and she has to deal with the consequences . 
  it 's called * political discourse * . 
  / pol / then, 
  also known as 4chan . 
  germany has had a huge influx of non-muslim immigrants who ` drink heavily ' as well for decades , though . 
  you are clearly misinformed about the amount of immigrants if you believe western europe will be `` literally losing their countries '' . 
  i 'm not so sure a demographic change is preferable to societal and economic collapse . 
  you talk like these things are mutually exclusive , but the opposite is the case . 
  most will be coming hand in hand , or due to outside influence we have no control over . 
  an over-aged population will be worse equipped to handle all of these problems . 
  1955 , when , on the condition of neutrality , the allied occupation of austria ended . 
  austria dodged a bullet by not becoming another soviet state . 
  luckily , nowadays our neutrality only exists on paper anyway . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  without replacement rate ( wether through births or immigration ) the pension system is at risk of collapsing or at least entering a crisis . 
  introduction of a greater variety of beverages from all over the world , most likely . 
  according to this chart it 's actually on the rise again in germany , and on the deline in america , how do you explain that ? 
  that 's what the headline says , but from the article it sounds more like the british ambassador voiced his disagreement in a measured , diplomatic statement . 
  so he just did his job . 
  i love some brit-bashing as much as the next guy ( / s ) , but these kinds of articles are fucking stupid . 
  it comes from * rhomaioi * ( romans ) , which is how the byzantines called themselves . 
  reading up on it a bit , it sounds like vetevendosje is a good example for a successful grassroots movement . 
  would this assessment be correct ? 
  would be nice if you could briefly explain what each party is about . 
  `` west bulgaria '' ? 
  we call it `` paprikahendl '' over here . 
   the ottoman were known for sending troops into eastern austria to loot and enslave the local population . 
  in the fact the ottomans always sent a special type of mounted unit far ahead of their actual army , to roam around in the enemy 's land , to pillage it , spread terror and fear among the local people and make slaves . 
  exactly , the so-called [ ak\u0131nc\u0131 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/akinji ) , or `` renner und brenner '' in german . 
  being stretched thin is * one of many factors * that contribute to the decline of an empire . 
  other factors are political infighting , weak leadership , complacency , other emerging powers . 
  all of which , in case of the ottomans , started to appear at the end of 17th century . 
  maybe ` stagnation ' is a better word . 
  but that 's exactly what i was saying : the decline would have happened anyway . 
  so even if the ottomans would have captured vienna , they could not have held onto it for very long . 
  you are right , it was bad wording . 
  what i meant was that the * events that would initiate the inevitable ottoman decline * were already in motion . 
  it 's how i learned it in school and from the museum . 
  the turkish army was soundly defeated by an army of the so-called holy league , comprised of hre and polish forces .
