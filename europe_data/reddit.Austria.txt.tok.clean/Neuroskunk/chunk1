do you think austrians would build something good-looking ? 
  austria is n't western european . 
  uhm , the right guy won the first time already ? 
  are n't we a banana republic already since '99 tho ? 
  or since waldheim 1986 ? 
  well i think it 's time to move to western europe now . 
  i fear hofer will win this time :(, 
  same here in austria . 
  unfortunetaly most parts of austria are rural . 
  some shitty countries acknowledge they did shitty things , weasel themselves out of any responsibility and try to repeat the same shit 70 years later . 
  welcome to austria !, 
  those weeks between the two elections were some of the weirdest/scariest in my life . 
  i 'm so glad sascha won . 
  austria has one of the biggest chechen diasporas in europe, 
  bratislava is also the only capital bordering more than one neighbouring country . 
   germany and austria , while being more similar , are not always located together because austria is considered central europe for a similarly arbitrary reason . 
  i 'd say germany is definitely western europe , and they are also vastly more similar to france than to us . 
  so considering germany western european and austria central european definitely makes sense . 
   and you could even still defend it were it not that way , because income wise austria is more like sweden than slovakia , or estonia more like albania than finland . 
  well yeah , while we are not as wealthy as sweden we are wealthier than slovakia . 
  but then again we share most of our culture with the latter one , and only a few things with sweden . 
  the habsburg definition was kind of a joke of course , but i do n't see a reason why romania ca n't into mitteleuropa :d, 
  well as i said before that 's my own opinion ; i ca n't think of anything i got in common with bavarians besides a dialectal continuum , while we share tons of food , architecture and culture with the hungarians or czechs . 
  that could be different for somebody from tyrol or salzburg for instance , but then again austrian regional sub-cultures are really different from each other as well , just like in every other part of the german speaking area . 
  well sorry bro , while you guys had a great dynasty taste , you did n't really have the top percentage of habsburgers :d, 
  well germany is kinda located in central europe , but culturally western european , and austria is 100 % central european both culturally and geographically . 
  as i said before all of that is highly subjective of course . 
   austria and germany are extremely similar culture and language wise . 
  well yeah , the germans and us share a language , but that 's about it . 
  i ca n't say that there are all too many cultural similarities between me as an eastern austrian and any german ( i love them of course , like i love all of our neighbours ) . 
  and the misbelief that austrians are germans led to two world wars and is only advocated by far right nuts nowadays . 
  neither charkiw nor sevastopol were in ** western ** ukraine last time i checked . 
  and of course i thought about galicia/lwiw when i talked about the central european part of ukraine . 
  well considering we share vastly more culture with cz , slovakia , slovenia and hungary than with germany my categorization * does * make sense for me and is n't even slightly weird , but then again this topic is a rather subjective one ... 
  i presume most germans ( and even more swiss ) would be kinda triggered being lumped together with us as well . 
  most of poland are definitely central european . 
  even western ukraine is in central europe after all . 
  i 'd define central europe as the countries who had the honour ofbeing ruled by the glorious habsburgs ( well obviously the austrian line , not the genetical inferior spanish line ) . 
  would also trigger many belgians , which is another plus . 
  austria is definitely not a western european country ; group us together with the blue ones and the map is pretty alright . 
  my other minor gripes are slovenia and croatia ( the latter one to a certain degree at least ) being central european as well . 
  the `` 1930s '' part was more about the general situation in our country . 
  was that an offer ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i 'm not ashamed of our history , i 'm ashamed of more than half of our population being stuck in the late 30s politically and that 's justified . 
  i already felt ashamed of being austrian before that obviously , 
  i 'm not a nazi . 
  i might be a liar , a pig , an idiot and a nazi , but i 'm not a porn actor !, 
   be ashamed of his nationality well there are tons of reasons to be ashamed of being austrian ( actually more than for most other countries of the world ) . 
  neither i am liberal in the european sense of this term . 
   i am not and i do n't claim to be an austrian . 
  honest mistake . 
  it 's fucking stupid that you use the flag of a random country though . 
   p.s just read text under your flair and i am fucking sad i lost dozens of seconds writing a reply to you . 
  what 's wrong with my flair text ? 
  and guys like you are one of the reasons why many people are ashamed of being austrian . 
  does n't work because of the * scharfes s * though : s, 
  well german topics are way more relevant for austrians than austrian topics for germans for obvious reasons . 
  we would be one of the top countries in the category dnb producers/capita . 
  that 's the best music video of all time . 
  ~ ~ of all time . ~ ~, 
  and that 's another reason we should finally abolish our pointless army . 
  you do n't fucking say a single bad word about hans  :(, 
  do n't tell anything to the mossad , or they 'll try to kill him a second time . 
  well let 's do this !, 
  and deny them german town-signs !, 
  lwiw 10 years ago when i was in high school . 
  we had a partner school there ; they visited us every year , and we were the first group visiting them . 
  and kiev last october for sightseeing and visiting the chernobyl exclusion zone . 
  it was a joke anyway , i would never travel to carinthia , eeeewww, 
  is that club any good ? 
  asking for a friend ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  i had a blast both times i 've been to ukraine . 
  definitely one of my favourite countries . 
  except ( almost ) nobody in austria has seen the sound of music :d, 
  nah , happens all the time in real life as well :d, 
  you are the first person ever who confused australia with austria . 
  it 's the opposite normally . 
  well sorry \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  switzerland does n't have a de jure capital ( bern is only the * bundesstadt * ) . 
  sounds like a normal austrian afternoon . 
  considering that fp\u00d6 will be in our next government , he 's screwed either way . 
  do you realize how pathetic you sound ? 
  i do n't commit to austria , so should i lose my citizenship now ? 
  lol also austrias requirements for citizenship are sadly some of the strictest in europe . 
  that does n't sound like good news for us and liechtenstein : s, 
  well i obviously know how european imperialism and colonialism changed the world , do n't worry . 
  austria never really colonized though ( not that they did n't try ) , nor did we change anything significant outside of central and eastern europe either . 
  thanks , but no thanks :d sicily was n't part of austria for that long either . 
  well i guess it 's time to annex triest again . 
   however it 's not and 100 % france , denmark and ** austria ** have had a much larger effect on the world , than any state in the us has or will have . 
  uh , i do n't think our tiny little shitstain had a bigger impact on the world than some us-states like california . 
  except starting multiple world wars maybe . 
  yeah , because german is a pluricentric language just like english . 
  thank you !, 
  kinda funny , since we were the guys actually starting this shitshow . 
  austria is n't a german country ? 
  we do n't really have any cultural or ethnic connections with germany besides the shared language . 
  why did n't you rename the street named after vienna as well ? 
  and what makes jesus , your hatepreacher , different from mohammed ? 
  hypocracy much ...
