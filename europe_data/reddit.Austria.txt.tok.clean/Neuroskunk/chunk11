  [ leberk\u00e4sesemmel ] ( http://imgur.com/a/faxl3 ) basically a kind of sausage ( mostly pork nowadays , but the traditional one is made from horse ) baked as a loaf and than eaten hot in a * kaiser * - roll . 
  my favourite one is k\u00e4seleberk\u00e4se , a cheese-filled variant . 
  not sure if they are actually my favourite ones , but i mostly drink wieselburger and stiegl austrian beer is generally pretty good fortunetaly , except abdominations like ottakringer . 
  this one should only be used for washing feet . 
  [ this house ] ( http://imgur.com/a/eqkpn ) fyi : that 's ( or rather was , since it was demolished ) actually josef fritzl 's house, 
  it sounds even more like * ficker * ( somebody who fucks , fucker ), 
  you got something wrong there . 
  germans are blunt but always honest , while we are the exact opposite . 
  getting wasted and then making out sounds pretty romantic to me : s, 
  since i have an oddly high number of friends who are cooks , food is actually serious business in our conversations . 
   date ? 
  nah , we just get drunk and ( maybe ) have sex . 
  same , but it 's the patricians way after all . 
  the [ dark ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesregierung_sch%c3%bcssel_i ) [ years ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesregierung_sch%c3%bcssel_ii ) between 2000 und 2007 . 
  then the not as dark period since then , and the probably even darker period starting after our next parliamentary elections . 
  [ and this case ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natascha_kampusch ), 
  i 'm pretty sad we are n't even in the top 10 :(, 
  uh politics or social issues . 
  ca n't really think of any other topics i 'd consider `` big '' . 
  dating in the american sense is n't all that common in austria . 
  you just get wasted , make out , then repeat that a few times until you 're in a relationship . 
  the rapey and grumpy alcoholic uncle !, 
  peter tobin is a really interesting one as well ( though he is scottish ), 
  meiwes is n't a serial killer though ( at least as far as we know ) . 
  some famous german serial killers would be * [ fritz honka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritz_honka ) * [ j\u00fcrgen bartsch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/j%c3%bcrgen_bartsch ) * [ fritz haarmann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritz_haarmann ) * [ martin ney ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martin_ney ) * [ joachim kroll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/joachim_kroll ), 
  he was first convicted in 1974 for the murder of an 18-year-old german and sentenced to life . 
  in prison he started to write short stories , poems and an autobiography ( purgatory or the trip to prison ) , which got him attention from many austrian artists , authors and intellectuals who campaigned for him . 
  he was eventually pardoned and released in 1990 and started to work as a radio host and reporter for the orf ( federal austrian broadcaster ) . 
  anyway jack could n't resist and strangled 6 prostitutes in austria and one in czechia within the first year of his release . 
  he even reported about his own murders in the radio . 
  while producing a reportage about prostitution in the us he killed an additional 3 women there as well . 
  unterweger was a suspect for the austrian police from a rather early stage . 
  they did n't have enough evidence until early 1992 though . 
  he evaded his arrest and fled through several european countries and the us until he was arrested in miami in late february ' 92 . 
  two years later , in the night after being sentenced to life once again , he hanged himself with his sweatpants with the same kind of knot he used to kill the prostitutes . 
  * als behmen noch bei estreich war * i 'm not a monarchist and happy that you guys are sovereign and all , but i still feel a closer cultural connection to you guys than to many german speaking areas < 3, 
  european : germany ( / s ) , nah probably azerbaijan if it 's counted as european . 
  non-european : somalia maybe ? 
  the us is obviously not all too culturally different , but that 's also the reason why some of the differences seem even more jarring . 
  still not one of the countries i 'd feel the most culturally different . 
  you met them ? 
  take care , buddy, 
  so that 's where our golatsche is from . 
  * we are the austrians . 
  your food will be assimilated . 
  resistance is futile . 
  of course they are pretty much `` cultural '' moslems . 
  i 'm an atheist myself after all . 
  i do n't know , it just seems more `` normal '' for me to have muslim friends who attend mosque a few times every year than having ( believing ) christian friends . 
  i guess that 's because only really religious people attend mass here at all ( at least that 's how it was in the semi-rural area around vienna where i grew up ) . 
  i do n't think that i could be friends with a religious christian to be honest , since i do n't think we would have much in common . 
  the only young ( believing ) christians i 've met were a polish schoolmate ( who was pretty alright ) and 2 rather creepy american mormon missionaries who tried to convert me . 
  they stopped bothering me when i started to sing that joseph smith song from south park . 
  i have quite a few muslim friends who attend mosque sometimes though . 
  yup , the 50 $ was a fine . 
  [ and the crowdsurfing was at a enter shikari ( a british punk/dnb crossover band ) concert at sziget festival in budapest . 
  probably smoking a cigarette in the viennese metro . 
  i was 16 or 17 back then , and had to pay 50 $ . 
  not my proudest moment : s also crowdsurfing while i was encased in some glued together tires . 
  was only dumb in the sense of being rather dangerous , but also pretty fucking awesome . 
  got a bit sick , since i drank quite a few beers beforehand , but everything turned out alright :d, 
  well better being trolled than being winged-hussared :d, 
  i 'm kinda mad we did n't incorporate pierogi into our cuisine , like so many other central-european dishes . 
  that looks so fuckin ' good . 
  i do n't think that 'll ever have a healthy relationship with my country unfortunetaly , but i got ta admit that you 're obviously right to a certain degree . 
  have my upvote . 
   i have to tell you to grow a pair . 
  in a country like austria , where nearly 50 % of the voters voted for a right-radical nutjob in the last presidential elections you definitely need a big `` pair '' to speak out against that lunacy . 
   you mention people holding grudges against others and i agree hating other ethnicities is bad , but you apparently hold a grudge against your own history and are `` ahamed . 
  yes i am , and that 'll never change . 
  the difference is that grudges between ethnicities lead to racism , which is always awful . 
   not only is this a bit pathetic how ? 
   but it does n't erase history true . 
   `` bad shit happened , not my fault though '' tell that the victims of both world wars , not to speak about all the other victims of austria . 
  it 's not my personal fault obviously , but the fault of my country . 
  and that 's definitely a reason to not embrace any form of patriotism here . 
   how would you know ? 
  we ca n't trust you ~ ~ westerners ~ ~ central-europeans . 
  ftfy , though i got ta admit , that your point still stands :d, 
  and you fortunetaly got them finally . 
  but culture and society changes . 
  you wo n't lose your language rights in a federalized eu , would you ? 
  patriotism is an outdated concept for me . 
  i 'm not trying to change your point of view , that 's just my opinion . 
  if you 're happy with being proud of your country it 's alright for me . 
  but if you 're from a place like austria and a half-decent person it 's not possible to not be ashamed of it . 
   you have your own dialect of german you should be looking to protect ... 
  i speak high-german , and would be okay with speaking american english , urdu or suaheli as well , it was just a coincidence i was born in a german-speaking country  , so many great people have come from austria and many of the worst people as well , and who cares ? 
  i 'm not related to most of them anyway  you 're very good at winter sports since i have never been skiing or have done any other winter-sport i do n't care about that either  vienna is a wonderful city i agree that vienna is an awesome place , but it 's foundation is the exploitation and terror on a good part of other central and eastern europeans , so it 's basically another reason for being ashamed . 
   the point of `` patriotism '' is making sure my language and culture is n't being erased and that our nation states , which hundreds of thousands of people died for ( since we did n't have it easy , like most western countries ) continue to endure . 
  that 's exactly the reason why i think that patriotism is an outdated and evil concept . 
  too many people died for that stupid shit . 
  but well , fortunetaly europe is a mostly free continent , and that 's the reason why we can have different opinions in that regard . 
  i might have a different point of view , since there is n't really anything to be proud of as an austrian anyway , only shit to be ashamed of . 
  i stare on maps for hours ( i 'm a pdx-fanboy ), 
  a good percentage of the yes-voters regret brexit already . 
  what 's even the point of patriotism besides having a fucking low self-esteem ?!, 
  and why would you hold a grudge against a whole ethnicity for stuff which happened centuries ago ? 
  i 'll never understand you right-extremists ... 
   it encroaches on my rights that 's bullshit  takes away my national identity and patriotism at least in the case of my country , austria , that 's a very very very good thing i embrace  it enforces the liberal system on me that 's pretty great as well,
