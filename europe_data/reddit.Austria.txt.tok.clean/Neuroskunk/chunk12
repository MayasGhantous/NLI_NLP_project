  1 ) jeans , t-shirts ( either neutral-coloured ones , or shirts from my favourite music labels and producers ) 2 ) beverage-wise 95 % i drink are either beer , wine , coffee or mineral water , food-wise i 'm not all too picky and i love to try out new stuff and obscure cuisines 3 ) austrian patriotism , racism , bad coffee 4 ) pretty good , since i 'll go to bratislava tonight 5 ) i 'm a pretty honest person , ca n't really think of anything i say without meaning it 6 ) way too many to mention :d, 
  well i generally know next to nothing about my mothers family . 
  i 've met my greatparents and my mothers siblings from that part of my heritage , that 's all . 
  not that i really care anyway ; my fathers side is the more interesting one , since my mother came from a family of farmers . 
  i rather have multi-culturalism than racist-assholes like you , sorry, 
  yup , both of my great grandfathers i know anything about fought in ww2 . 
  one of them was an `` illegal '' ( an austrian nazi before 1938 ) and fought on the western front , while the other one lost both his legs because of a grenade in russia ( and was carried home on the back of another soldier after he was released from war captivity ) . 
  it 's possible that my other two great grandfathers were wehrmacht soldiers ( or even worse ss-members ) as well obviously . 
  why would you even think austria and germany are * buddy buddy * ? 
  there is n't really much cultural similarity between our two countries , bavaria aside , after all ( besides the language arguably ) . 
  though i * do * find the inferiority complex many austrians have regarding germany really stupid , and would like to have a buddy in europe , since we are pretty much isolated . 
  tell locals that you find this part of germany really beautiful . 
   do people in other european countries give you a hard time for simply being german ( either jokingly or serious ) ? 
  we do , both jokingly and serious , because of our collective inferiority complex . 
  which is kinda silly , since we do n't really share much culture besides the language . 
   sleipnir - stimmen im wind do you realize that sleipnir is an actual neonazi-band ? 
  if you ever feel the urge to throw somebody out of a window again we 're ready , northern bros < 3, 
  i do have breakfast !, 
  coffee and cigarettes , like most austrians, 
  11am-12am mostly , sometimes 11:30 -12:30 . 
  i do n't eat anything for breakfast , so i 'm hungry quite early . 
  not sure about the situation in nl , but here in at i would be more worried if i had soldiers anywhere near myself . 
  a really useless ( besides catastrophy aid ) and underfunded institution for right-wing nuts and mentally impaired people . 
  a neutral country like ours does n't need conscription or any army at all . 
   people who join the military are losers who could n't do anything else in their life . 
  they make delicious pea soup though . 
  exactly the same ; though here they make awesome goulash . 
  * burgenland : inbred and kinda mentally impaired third world people ( kinda true ) * lower austria : bland/ugly , wine , dictatorship of the most powerful austrian , people like to keep other people in their cellars ( that 's where i 'm from , the state , not a cellar , yay ) * vienna : worst drivers , `` different '' than other austrians , smug * upper austria : bavarian nazis , much industry * salzburg : mozart * styria : pumkin-seed oil sniffing dudes who kinda sound like dogs * carinthia : mediterranean nazis * tyrol : mountains , kchchchchchchchchchchch * vorarlberg : why are n't you swiss ? 
   liebesgschicht 'n und heiratssachen or rather anything produced by elizabeth t. spira . 
  such a great woman . 
  i talked to an aussie once , and one of the only guys from austria he knew was tobias motherfucking moretti . 
  i do n't know your entry either ( or any other including the austrian one ) , but everything is better than aluhut naidoo . 
  / r/austria is ( fortunetaly ) way more left-wing than austria in general . 
  most right-wingers/patriots are heavily downvoted or mocked . 
  i 'm not proud of anything of our country , quite the opposite actually . 
  what i really like about europe is that we have some of the highest life quality in the world , our open borders and the great cuisines of many european countries . 
  you should try some austrian beers , we got quite a few decent ones . 
  awesome view , looks a bit like the waldviertel . 
  i grew up about 20 meter from a forest on a hill and miss that quite often , since my current balcony view is a kik sign . 
  it 's the second biggest ( at least i think so ) cemetry in europe and has more `` inhabitants '' than vienna itself . 
  and since the viennese soul is a pretty morbid one , [ one of the most famous austropop songs is about it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qrdfvnx_f0 ) . 
  [ recess , one of my favourite 90s disney shows ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zobiglkzkzc ), 
  well , some * effen * are still advocating a reunification of tyrol . 
  american football is quite popular in austria compared to most other european countries ( though still very niche nevertheless ) . 
  the austrian football clubs are n't even that bad for such a tiny country , and there 's almost always at least one german or austrian team in the eurobowl . 
   it 's a nice , historic city and most people i 've met abroad thought it was the capital of austria anyway . 
  seriously ? 
  never met any foreigners who thought salzburg is the capital . 
  they either knew it 's vienna or thought canberra is our capital . 
  definitely northern german culture . 
  and 50 % of the people have czech surnames anyway !, 
  austria has the highest quota of teenage smokers in the eu , and the legal smoking age is 16 . 
  so yeah , we love our cigarettes ~ ~ and spliffs ~ ~ . 
  nope , they are polish . 
  though to be fair a certain pessimism is necessary to survive in a country like austria ... 
  and as far as i know , at least from playing a few hundred hours of eu4 , historically . 
  not really ; most austrians have a stupid-ass inferiority complex regarding germans , which leads to hostility , while many germans think of austrians as those weird mountain-nazis who dare to speak some perverted form of their language . 
  it 's kinda sad that we are rather isolated in europe , but that 's how it is . 
  not sure about heaven , since i enjoy different kinds of food/lovers . 
  hell : the policeman is american , the lover is swiss , the cook is german , the engineer is austrian and it is all organized by austrians . 
  or bosnia-herzegowina for that matter . 
  i may be a staunch atheist , but that statement makes my habsburg chin twitch . 
  some parts of the south probably . 
  he is still way too right-wing for my taste , but definitely better than clinton and trump . 
  i got ta agree that sas is really oversensitive/generic in many cases , but some [ gems like this fella ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/5zmk4e/do_i_look_dark_irish_do_i_look_german/ ) definitely deserve being made fun of because of their ignorance . 
   we stormed normandy to save their asses . 
  patton took our heroic grandfathers across france and drove those goddamned nazis before them like an army of conans lead by alexander himself with the spirit of caesar in their hearts . 
  now we 're doing the same thing for europe , but the internet is the battlefront . 
  that 's a quite funny example , since patton was pretty antisemitic as well . 
  hopefully not . 
  not european places/figures but there is a kennedy bridge and a mexico plaza in vienna . 
  ( schwedenplatz was already mentioned by somebody else ) . 
  well anything but villainization is fortunetaly illegal in austria as well . 
  even our right-extremist `` freedom '' party cunts distance themselves from national-socialism , even though their precursor party was founded by former nsdap members . 
  i mean it 's pretty disgusting if it is n't fresh and ice-cold , but if it is fresh i vastly prefer it over any other softdrink ( except almdudler maybe ) . 
  tastes are different , 
  i think of our current military as a rather pointless and anachronistic establishment , since we are a neutral country . 
   what 's a belgium ? 
  do you mean ~ ~ zuid brabant ? 
  / s ~ ~ the austrian netherlands ? 
  ftfy, 
  at least you guys have kofola and superior drug laws :d, 
  [ the classic austria/australia switcheroo ] ( https://archive.is/0bbo2 ), 
   gesaffelstein ( ** feel like german electro music , do n't know why ** ) well even his alias is a combination of `` gesamtkunstwerk '' and `` einstein '' . 
  great music , and i got ta admit that he is one sexy motherfucker . 
  homebrewing is legal to a certain extent , and many farmers distill their own schnaps . 
  i think i read once that austria has one of the highest rates of overweight people in europe , but one of the lowest rates of obesity .

  the viennese metropolitan area !, 
  i even get a newsticker from my favourite newspaper over whatsapp a few times every day, 
  beer and wine ( and liquor/schnaps to a certain degree ) are vastly more popular than cider ( even though we have something similar called `` most '' ) . 
  i like cider though :d, 
  why do n't you ask that in / r/austria ? 
  phone/tablet/private pc : opera as browser and google as search engine . 
  work computer : ie and google . 
  a dude called andreas gabalier is pretty unpopular with most decent austrians ; not only is his music rather shitty , but he is also an open patriot and sympathizes with our right-wing populist party . 
  america is a double continent , while americans is generally used for citizens of the united states . 
   austrian direct democratic issues ca n't think of many popular votes besides the one about conscription in the last decade to be honest . 
  i identify as human first , european second and flatland austrian third ( i 'm not patriotic at all though , quite the opposite actually ) . 
  normally we do n't really need any holidays to get wasted .
