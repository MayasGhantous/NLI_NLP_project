  jokes aside , st. patrick 's day is celebrated in quite a few bars nowadays ( and not exclusively irish pubs either ) . 
  otherwise oktoberfests became more popular in the last few years , but they suck hard for the most part . 
  fuckin ' awesome music . 
  otherwise not really any different from other americans . 
  the only one coming to mind right now would be [ tshee-ka-goh ] in broad austrian dialect ; though regarding states germanizations like neu york , pennsylvanien , nord-dakota used to be common half a century ago , though the only one still used is kalifornien for california . 
  i 've never voted for our communist party ( though they are the second strongest party in the city-council of graz , our second biggest city , and i 'd definitely vote for them if i lived there ) . 
  they are a tiny party otherwise , but seem pretty alright compared to certain parties which might get over 30 % at the next elections here . 
   austria - albert einstein even though einstein had the austrian citizenship for a while , i would n't really consider him austrian . 
  we 'd probably be asked about ostritches then , and kangaroos are the superior species . 
  most popular ones are * [ nova rock ] ( http://www.novarock.at/ ) - rock and metal ; never been there though * [ frequency ] ( https://frequency.at/ ) - indie , dnb , minimal , rock , metal ; basically everything , since it 's hosted by the federal youth radio * [ electric love ] ( https://www.electriclove.at/de ) / [ electric love ] ( http://www.lake-festival.at/ ) - basically tomorrowland conterfeits , never been there either * [ nu forms ] ( http://www.nuforms.at/ ) - dnb ; it 's the successor of urban art forms , which used to be the biggest dnb festival in continental europe, 
  best fuckin festival in the world . 
  been there 3 times already . 
  the only sms i receive are the ones from my provider . 
  even my granny has whatsapp , there is n't really a reason to use sms anymore . 
   if a habsburg wants to step on austrian soil , they have to sign a statement that they wo n't run for public office . 
  not sure about other positions , but habsburgs are allowed to run for president since 2011 . 
  [ this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_federal_railways ), 
  * the animals of farthing wood * recess * goof troop * wickie * dragon ball, 
  another reason to finally travel to portugal for me :d, 
  [ that 's my 3 year old kitty zelda !, 
  have n't heard of them either , am eastern austrian . 
   but it 's ** required ** to not like germans ftfy, 
   this terrible management would have been her last political move in most european countries including austria . 
  but apparently not in germany . 
  i have to agree that it would 've been her last political move in austria . 
  which is kinda sad , since a humane refugee policy comparable to germany is what i 've wished for us as well . 
  unfortunetaly there are still way too many patriots and racists here . 
  nah , we austrians prefer religious and claim throne as cbs :d, 
  you are a the summary of what 's wrong with europe right now . 
  probably , since the german word for lame is `` lahm '' ( lamb would be `` lamm '' ) . 
   the radical left is very anti-semitic ( they say they are only anti-israel , but no , they are completely filled with hate and team up with islamists cause of their common enemy ) the radical left is a diverse bunch ; do n't generalize , since many leftists are very pro-israel ( and not just `` antideutsche '' ) . 
   what is a ` belgium ' ? 
  do you mean the austrian lowlands ? 
   `` did france ever won a war ? '', 
  the person who asked that never played eu4 before . 
  hardly happens here ( fortunetaly ) . 
  in the rare case it happens i mostly try to get out of the situation , since most people who try to smalltalk with strangers in public are weirdos ( at least in austria ) . 
  strangers asking for directions and stuff like that are obviously different , i try to help them of course . 
  we got many awesome dnb producers like mefjus , camo & krooked , kimyan law , roygreen & protone , tr tactics and fourward at the moment . 
  those are well regarded in that scene ( but otherwise pretty unknown of course , since dnb is n't exactly mainstream in most places ) . 
  falco might be known for `` rock me amadeus '' , but he has been dead for almost 20 years now . 
  wan na exchange the rest of tyrol for trieste ? 
  definitely !, 
  belgium is one of the prettiest countries i 've been to actually !, 
  not a huge fan of mountains to be honest . 
  i dislike the landscape and most of the music artists . 
  also rampant racism and patriotism ( especially considering our history ) . 
   i also think we are the only country where prussian is still the go to swear word for germans . 
  even though it 's not that common anymore , it 's still an `` insult '' in austria . 
  so basically karel schwarzenberg ? 
   alright so basically , jrotc is a high school program here in the us that helps teens and young adults build leadership skills , serve the community , be patriots , and build a sense of esprit de corps/unity . 
  we do drills , wear military uniforms , etc. 
  sounds a bit like the hitler youth , which fortunetaly has n't been a thing here for over 70 years . 
  to be fair , hofer actually is crazy ( but then again 50 % of the austrians are crazy anyway ) . 
  i totally understand that this topic does n't have any relevance for a dutch citizen of course . 
  well i 'm glad when it 's finally over . 
  this election campaign was way too long already . 
  i think hofer ( the right-extremist candidate ) will win , which is obviously horrible and a huge shame for every normal austrian . 
  i do n't think most fellow europeans will care , since austria is ( fortunetaly ) pretty irrelevant . 
  pizza with salmon , spinach and feta/generic sheep milk cheese is pretty common here in austria . 
  waiters and waitresses in austria ( and especially vienna ) are notoriously unfriendly . 
  i ca n't think of many jobs more pathetic than being member of an army to be honest . 
  oh , so east thrace is suddenly not a part of europe anymore ? 
  thirty years ' war . 
  another shitshow my country was responsible for . 
  mlinci looks fuckin good , might do them for my roasted goose next year instead of dumplings :d, 
   and it confirm the theory that when people are unhappy and you give them the choice between status quo and outrage , sometimes they will choose outrage . 
  there 's a lesson in that . 
  and `` outrage '' is the worse choice in most cases , at least nowadays . 
  goose roast with red cabbage and dumplings !, 
  technically fascism and national socialism are n't the same ( not that it makes a big difference , both are reasonably similar ) . 
  and even if you consider them exactly the same both austria and italy had fascist-governments before germany had one . 
  i 'm pretty sure most of us europeans and a sizable chunk of your fellow americans rather have free healthcare , labour laws which benefit employees instead of employers and proper social benefits than your great `` freedom from '' . 
  ca n't think of a reason why you would post on a subreddit ofeuro-socialist cucks either , besides being a troll or having a huge inferiority complex . 
  we eat serbian bean soup and sing `` gott erhalte franz , den kaiser '' . 
  make new mexico old mexico again !, 
   the dutch wikipedia page talks about `` a taboo '' on christmas music before 6 december . 
  we need that here !, 
  you can have all of styria and carinthia if you want :d, 
  do n't know why i connected `` gut , werner '' to faymann then , my bad . 
   haha , i did n't know you had `` italian lifestyle '' people in austria !, 
  not to unplausible , considering you are our favourite neighbours :d, 
  well the cheaper white wines at discounters cost about $ 2.70 per liter . 
  those are mostly cuv\u00e9e 's and do n't taste that bad pure . 
  the one i take to music festivals takes the cake though . 
  it 's sold in 2l plastic bottles and costs $ 2 . 
  you do n't have to refill them in a different bottle , because glass bottles are n't allowed on festivals . 
  i do n't think there is anything cheaper either and it tastes reeeeaaallly fuckin ' horrible if you drink it pure . 
  the bottle does n't even specify the country or even the colour of wine ( `` european wine '' ) . 
  depends , mine are about 1/3 water and 2/3 wine ( a `` summer spritzer '' is weaker ) , so not that much alcohol in one glass either , but you can drink more of them and way faster than beer for instance . 
  another advantage is that it does n't really matter if the wine is good or bad , so you can use cheap wine too . 
  wine spritzer ( i actually had to google the english term ) is definitely the most popular/common mixed drink here . 
  we use it to get drunk fast or as a refreshing drink in the summer . 
  so what 's the crucial difference between two forms of organic material without sentience if i may ask ? 
  uhm most europeans beg to differ , since an embryo is hardly more than a bunch of cells . 
  so it 's definitely not murder . 
  i 'm for free contraceptives for everybody though , which might lead to less abortions . 
  lower austria , near vienna !, 
  it 's mostly used at the deli-counter in super markets ( `` 20 deka gouda '' instead of `` 200 gramm gouda '' ) or measuring drugs nowadays . 
  dekagramm is widely used here in austria ( i actually thought it 's a unique austrian thing ) , so it might be common in some parts of the former empire ?
