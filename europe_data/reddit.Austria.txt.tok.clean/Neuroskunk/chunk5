   he 's austrian british and speaks austrian-german with british accent/grammar please please , only ~ ~ northern slovenians ~ ~ styrians talk like arnie , and their dialect is horrible . 
  you guys are obviously right . 
  i do n't think arnie would dub his movies in german anyway , since it 's a shitload of work with a comparably low salary . 
  iirc he also refused being interviewed in german by austrian tv a few years ago , since he regarded his german skills as too low nowadays . 
  at least here in austria k\u00e4rcher and k\u00e4rchern are almost exclusively used . 
  we call cocaine cola around here funnily enough . 
  it is easy to buy them here as well obviously . 
  source : i 'm wearing a plain color shirt right now . 
  nonsensical prints are common , but most of them look ugly as fuck . 
  heck we are allowed to vote , smoke and drink alcohol after we turn 16 and not even we have anything like a sweet 16 . 
  one of my great grandfathers came in the 30s from the exotic country of germany to work here , and my bohemian ancestors arrived in the mid/late 19th century as far as i know . 
  chechnyans and afghans apparently do n't get along well , and there are certain tensions between some ( but obviously not all ) members of different ex-yu ethnicities here . 
  ( just saw the consistently part , not sure if those apply for other countries as well ) . 
  also soletti for pretzel sticks , f\u00f6n for hair dryers and kelomat for pressure cookers . 
   bavaria [ m\u00fcnchner r\u00e4terepublik stronk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bavarian_soviet_republic ), 
  dunno , something between 1800 and 2000 $ approximately . 
  he should 've taken humanist instead of wasting 1000s of dip mana though ... 
  my surname is approximately the 3600th most common surname in austria , but it 's a rare spelling variation of one of the most common ones . 
  apparently my great grandmothers brother was a criminal and fled to the us in the early 30s . 
  was never heard of again though . 
  it 's just ~ ~ a prank ~ ~ friendly internal bickering bro \u00dc i could 've called you prussian after all . 
  hey , i actually called you a * mountain german * !, 
   usually only people with very dubious political or religious views want to have their kids homeschooled . 
  well that 's the biggest problem i have with homeschooling . 
  just the truth , bro  ( and this thread is about triggering foreigners anyway ), 
  bullshit , bavarians are southern prussians . 
  i 'd rather merge with cz . 
  i 'm way more comfortable with schluchtenschei\u00dfer than with * \u00d6si * . 
  i know , but the mid 90s were the era the dnb/jungle scene peaked anyway , and since austria is slow it never died out here . 
  that 's chairman kim himself actually . 
  glory to juche !, 
  well for me personally yes , since i 'm mostly into drum 'n' bass music , and this genre is basically non-existent in germany . 
   `` damn , berlin , what a city . 
  berlin    vienna ( except the music scene maybe ) . 
  there i said it . 
  but then again i 'm not german . 
  so the stereotype about foreigners liking it is probably true . 
   we have n't seen the sound of music . 
  literally nobody in austria has seen it . 
  i did in english class , and it 's fucking horrible . 
  schnitzel with noodles ?!, 
  wtf, 
  you are n't a real austrian if you have n't been to one of the hausmeisterstr\u00e4nde ( `` janitor beaches '' ) . 
  i agree though , lignano is really lame . 
  because it 's a bullshit populist move because of our elections in october . 
  definitely in this specific case . 
  make austria kaiserthum again ? 
  well you guys can have your rightful clay ( styria and carinthia ) if you want, 
   but parties win or lose elections on their party manifestos . 
  well austrian parties do n't work like that . 
  it 's all about populism here :(, 
  that 's a pretty interesting idea !, 
  i 'll definitely check it out . 
  thank you , we really would like to have a harbour again . 
  that 's a palatschinke , wtf . 
  i got ta side with the german guy about what an omelette is . 
  [ so all of those polls are 100 % wrong ? 
  i 'd rather have any party besides the vp ( and the fp obviously ) leading as well , but their recent surge in popularity is nothing you could deny . 
  which is scary , since kurz is n't any less racist than the fp\u00d6 . 
   where it belongs fuck , i hope you are n't serious about that . 
  i read a few of the knickerbockerbande books and obviously saw tom turbo back then . 
  did n't know he was known outside of austria to be honest ... edit : just researched that a bit . 
   his adventure-series a case for you and the tiger-team was a big international success , particularly in china , where the series overtook harry potter in terms of sales numbers at certain points . 
  holy fuck . 
  well vienna also hosts the opec for instance , even though austria does n't really extract much oil . 
  vienna is a diplomatic hub ( which hosts the osce and has one of the four uno hqs ) , good infrastructure and it 's also the capital of a neutral country . 
  not with me :(, 
   kurz is fairly moderate you must be a troll . 
  many families with a house got one , either a `` normal '' buried one or the inflateable variant . 
  and that guy was a fascist lunatic responsible for the death of tens of million people . 
  well our cultures are vastly different after all ; the us is a lot more individualist and capitalist for instance . 
  imo mediocrity is sufficient in an already very priviledged and wealthy country like ours , and austrians are generally lazy in their own way . 
  there are quite a few people who want to strengthen our growth again , but most of them are either economically liberal or patriots/nationalists . 
  two currents i 'm not really a big friend of . 
  exactly . 
  i save up quite a bit as well , just for worse times ( or later for my kids maybe ) , but working really hard just for the sake of ** maybe ** having more money than i 'd be able to spend is n't anything i 'm interested in . 
  well you 're free to try to become one . 
  many austrians ( including me ) prefer our traditional lazy mediocrity though . 
   prefer eastern european countries like poland and the czech republic because they hard working , religious and wholesome people poland and czechia are central european , and cz is actually one of the least religious countries in the world . 
  you do n't seem to know much about europe at all , buddy . 
  czech and hungarian , since they 're interesting languages and will be really useful after the reunification . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ^ ^ ^ ^ regarding ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ last ^ ^ ^ ^ part, 
  not sure why you were downvoted , patriotism ( and especially austrian patriotism obviously ) is something i ca n't stand either . 
   whoever is currently president has a party at prague castle no offense northern bro , but does n't zeman have a party in the hrad daily anyway ? 
   personally i enjoy the day with my family or use it to visit relatives becaus it 's a work free day that 's my `` celebration '' as well . 
  well arnie is still an austrian citizen ... 
  [ hc strache ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinz-christian_strache ) for quentin tarantino maybe ? 
  nope , at least not officially . 
  though i 'd say a party which is patriotic for a country responsible for the death of hundreds of millions people because of racist reasons should definitely be included in the `` far right '' . 
   do you celebrate the 26th of october ( austrian national day ) in the us ? 
  to be fair i do n't even know any austrians who would `` celebrate '' austrian national day . 
  you 've become a mod of / r/ostberlin !, 
   wecken \u0ca0_\u0ca0 that 's clearly a kaisersemmel . 
  just ( half ) kidding , but i love how pluricentric german is . 
  i just read up about that guy , and his alternative name is * vormund * , which sounds pretty fucking metal in a weird way . 
  meh , i love both of those , especially when i 'm wasted ( so quite often , i 'm austrian after all ) . 
   i do n't know how much about that is true but we even have statues in her honor for that very reason ... to be fair she was one of the most decent habsburgs anyway . 
  you forgot how lenin rose from his coffin to spit some mean rhymes against the west . 
  the only one i can think of is falco . 
  he 's only known for rock me amadeus outside of austria ( and maybe germany ?
