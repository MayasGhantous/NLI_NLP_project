  i actually saw some lynx occasionally when i was a child . 
  the closest border to where i lived is the styrian one . 
  i would think that gouda , parmesan and mozzarella rank higher , but it 's really not that easy to say . 
  there 's also bergbaron and drautaler which are just variants of other cheeses really . 
  out of the 15 people there 's one indian , one serbian , rest is austrian . 
  since the last election we 've had 2 chancellors and soon 3 vice-chancellors . 
  to be perfectly honest , snap elections are reasonable . 
  arguably the \u00d6vp has been blocking reforms and any movement in the government due to the popularity of the new sp\u00d6 chancellor in an attempt to make him look worse , while hoping their own `` starboy '' who is now seeking to taking over the party would win them the next elections . 
  he has been quite popular due to his strict stance on refugees . 
  ( this is just my personal opinion though ) . 
  my parents in carinthia have the softest water however . 
  i was n't even used to water spots ( wasserflecken ) until moved to vienna . 
  kaze no ne from the final fantasy crystal chronicles ost . 
  i do n't actually speak any japanese . 
  hills of radiant wind from the nier ost . 
  not an actual language , which makes it literally incomprehensible . 
  we also have a difference between regular high schools that go from grade 5-12 and those that are only for grades 8-12 ( borg ) . 
  it was very noticeable . 
  i live rather close to one of the bigger parks in vienna ( stadtpark ) and it was completely full there for a week or two . 
  varies throughout the country . 
  where i am from we have lots of dried/smoked/cooked meats ( sausages , pork , cowtongue ) cut uo into small pieces stacked on a plate with eggs and hirseradish on top . 
  instead of regular bread we have reindling , which is made from sweetened sourdough . 
  the whole concept of left/centre/right is not one of absolutes but relativity . 
  the context in the us is a different one than in europe . 
  by european standards trump is definitely on the right of the spectrum , as are republicans in general . 
  personally i like the swedish and eu flags a lot . 
  there 's just something about the combination of colours . 
  other than that it 's nepal . 
  it 's just very unique . 
  i do n't know about best , but supposedly it 's one of the oldest . 
  it 's also totally metal because the red is the blood on the shirt of a prince/king after a battle . 
  the white is where his belt covered the shirt so it did n't get boody . 
  you ( accidentally ) mapped shit to qualit\u00e4t and quality to schei\u00dfe . 
  to sum it up : quality shitpost upvote i came here to say this . 
  best time to go since all the squat racks are free . 
  yes . 
  all central europe is austria . 
  we just do n't keep anyone on a tight leash . 
  i think that may have been the joke . 
  he was technically austrian but he also was a german leader . 
  here we also have [ icelandic yoghurt ] ( http://www.skyriceland.com/images/products-2013.png ) which is super high in protein . 
  american , dough that is round in shape and glazed with sugar `` schwedenbomben '' : lit . 
  either bombs from sweden or swede 's bombs , formerly known as `` negerk\u00fcsse '' ( lit . 
  negro kisses ) , thin waffel discs topped with marshmallow cream and covered in cholocate . 
  supposedly they originated from denmark . 
  `` hamburger '' : lit . 
  person from hamburg , needs no explanation i hope `` frankfurter '' : lit . 
  person from frankfurt , in germany this is referred to as `` wiener w\u00fcrstchen '' ( lit . 
  `` viennese sausage '' or `` sausage of a viennese person '' , it 's ambiguous ) , essentially the sausage you put in your hot dog `` eskimo '' : lit . 
  eskimo , essentially like an elongated slightly pointy bread roll filled with peach jam and covered in desiccated coconut ( reminiscent of snow ) . 
  parisian , cooked sausage , better known as `` extrawurst '' `` wiener schnitzel '' : lit . 
  viennese cutlet , a piece of meat in a crust of breadcrumbs , actually italian in origin, 
  with netherlands i just always tend to think of demons or something . 
  maybe not on an individual basis , but in general i would argue that there are certain values people share , like never ever wearing shoes in the house . 
  canada or japan . 
  japan simply because i find their culture interesting , not sure if i would actually want to stay there though . 
  noone i know wears shoes indoors . 
  there 's a part in pretty much every household dedicated to taking off your shoes and potentially putting on gues shoes/slippers . 
  not directly . 
  indirectly sort of , but not for every type of job . 
  but we almost got everything covered . 
  50 % of its area is green area , and around the outer parts of the city you will find areas that look more like a small city with a population of a few thousand . 
  the eu flag . 
  the swiss one is a big plus though . 
  austria : fp\u00d6 : crazy rightwing extremists \u00d6vp : would love to watch you while you sleep , or pee , or cook , or go shopping , or are sending an e-mail to your mom , or while you are pooping in front of the door of the interior ministers house sp\u00d6 : it 's all their fault anyway . 
  greens : leftwing fascist nazi communists . 
  neos : would love for everything to be owned by private companies : water distribution , social insurance , your children . 
  which makes no sense , considering the head of state has little to do with merkel who is chancellor . 
  i think finding the california of the eu might also be interesting . 
  personally i think sweden might fit the bill . 
  for austria it would have to be vienna . 
  lower austria has a similar political influence since it has roughly as many eligible voters , but is by far more conservative . 
  because we do n't want war . 
  also we would n't want to invade russia , so we would n't necessarily fight on their territory , causing lots of structural damage to eastern europe in the process , which already is worse off than the rest . 
  and this is still completely ignoring the potential damage nukes would cause to a large number of cities everywhere . 
  the weirdest variation in german that i am aware of btw is strawberry . 
  it 's known as erdbeere mostly everywhere . 
  however there are parts of lower austria where strawberries are called `` ananas '' , which means pineapple in almost every language including german . 
  haha no . 
  they already ruled one federal state and ruined it ( highest debt , lowest economy growth , lots of young people leaving ) and they also were part of government 15-10 years ago and courts are still not finished dealing with all their bullshit . 
  gulasch is definitely way up there on the list , although globally i would think that pizza is the most important dish europe brought to the world . 
  personally i like ther berlins and viennas of the world if that makes sense . 
  the colorful mix of everything . 
  * contraction, 
  i have had english lessons since i was in third grade ( 8/9 , i was born in 1991 ) , and i read/watched a lot in english ( trying to translate the yu-gi-oh trading card game rules when i was 11 or 12 , watching cartoon network , which was only available in english ) . 
  my little brother ( born 1993 ) had english lessons since first grade iirc . 
  halloween is mostly celebrated in vienna , but not too much . 
  st. patrick 's day is something some pubs may want to be a part of , but in general people do n't consciously celebrate it , they just passively partake . 
  i do n't even know anyone that celebrates valentine 's day . 
  also it makes absolutely 0 sense for one country to celebrate another countries independence day . 
   one thing i notice is that / r/askeurope tends to be far more pro-immigration than / r/europe . 
  the problem is that most people like to boil such a complex issue down to a few sentences which may give the impression that people here are more on the left of the spectrum , but you do n't really have to be leftist to be pro some kind of immigration for instance . 
  i would say center-right to left . 
  it 's just that most people are n't even clear anymore on what center-right even means , considering angela merkel is a center-right politician , but when asked most people would put her more towards the left . 
  there 's less tolerance for the right , far right and far left though .

  my grandmother was born in 1934 , so i suppose she would remember . 
  she thinks we 're close to the appcalypse apparently . 
  the sad part is that the 30 % of people you talk about likely think the exact same thing about another at least 30 % of the population .
