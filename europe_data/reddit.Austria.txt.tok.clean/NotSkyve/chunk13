  i just imagined people trying to say \u00d6sterreich . 
  * shudders * yeah , we 're good . 
  fp\u00d6 currently is the third strongest party and the strongest according to polls . 
  however we are still a year away from elections . 
  the fuck is ruinenlust ? 
  well known children 's book authors : * astrid lindgren * christine n\u00f6stlinger ( essentially the austrian astrid lindgren ) * erich k\u00e4stner * thomas brezina * the not so grim grimm fairytales, 
  nah , schulz would actually try to make europe great , instead of just claiming he will and then lighting everything on fire . 
  edit : also i originally thought that / r/the _ donald was satire . 
  i use cups for rice ( ie . 
  half a cup ( or a small cup ) of rice plus two cups of water ) unless i really want to cook a very specific amount of rice . 
  pretty much everything else i just eyeball or measure in si units . 
  ignoring the fact that you are not only wrong , since most of these if not all exist , but in local variations , you also did n't really get my point . 
  the point being that most countries have their own great pastries , claiming that any one country has `` the best '' is just insane ( or ignorant , take your pick ) . 
  you can ask for penpals at / r / [ countryname ] , ie / r/austria . 
  alternatively , travelling via couchsurfing helps . 
  did you see that ludicrous display last night ? 
  i just happen to live on a street that directly connects to the donaukanal , so everybody walks their dog there . 
  generally very clean , except for dog poop . 
  street is stra\u00dfe , road is landstra\u00dfe , but can also be just stra\u00dfe . 
  there 's more differences than shown on the map though , at least within austria . 
  south tyrol and tyrolian dialects are relatively similar from what i can tell , but carinthiana and tyrolian dialects do still vary quite a bit , even though all three fall under the dark blue area . 
  there is a `` fescht '' / `` fest '' divide shown , but even that is n't detailed enough from my experience , although i suppose the differences might not have registered as dialects because their grammar might not be different . 
  on the other hand the map says `` mundarten '' , according to [ this page ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%a4rntner_mundart ) there 's 6 carinthian `` mundarten '' . 
  below that people generally are not considered adults yet ( due to their age ) , so it makes sense that it would n't be acceptable any earlier than that . 
  from what i know , lots of companies tend to be bought up by either the us or china , which makes it really difficult to have something european succeed as european . 
  the eu would have to invest in some way , so that being bought is n't always the best solution for every new company . 
  to be fair , literally any european country would fight the uk on such insane claims . 
  his claim with regards on cakes makes no sense for instance . 
  everyone knows that the habsburg empire , and vienna specifically has always been great at making desserts . 
  the french know it so well that they even have a whole category of baked goods [ named after vienna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viennoiserie ) . 
  in austria on the other hand we have adopted lots of great cakes from our eastern friends , like [ hungary 's dobos cake ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dobos_torte ) , which is very useful if you want to kill someone via heartattack , because they wo n't stop eating it . 
  switzerland has no direct connection to any oceans , so that likely is the reason why it is so limited . 
  i have no idea if they are allowed in austria , but i do n't think i have seen any . 
  vienna has the [ university of applied arts ] ( http://www.dieangewandte.at/jart/prj3/angewandte-2016/main.jart?rel=en&amp;content-id=1454062383446&amp;reserve-mode=active ) , which offers degrees focused on various things . 
  if you are talking about small cramped shops that have a variety of products , then they are generally very rare here . 
  those that exist that i am aware of are usually turkish owned i think , but they are n't exactly the same type of shop , at least if i compare them to the ones i have seen in brussels/barcelona . 
  austria is mostly annoying in the southern parts due to all the mountain roads . 
  roads generally are in decent shape though . 
  it 's dragosta din tei . 
  dragostanite sounds like a pok\u00e9mon . 
  historically social democrats , if there still were any minors they 'd likely be voting for the freedom party . 
  this applies to the general `` working class '' . 
  [ paris ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqo_66i3cw ), 
   i agree about the lack of democratic legitimisation though . 
  it 's not that there is none at all as the bundestag members are elected and the land gouvernments selecting the electors are legitmised as well , but i 'd prefer a direct election of the head of state as well . 
  that would just unnecessarily increase the cost of such an election , with no real value gained , since the german president has no real impact on anything . 
  it 's not like the german president is directly elected , that makes it a lot less interesting , since the outcome can be easily predicted . 
  [ steirereck ] ( http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners/steirereck ) , has 2 michelin stars iirc . 
  everyone should be able to get an abortion , and if the circumstances make an abortion the sensible choice , insurance/the state should pay for it . 
  i tend to want to use the british writing , but i run into issues with it , like trying to use a library function to convert an image from rgb to grey and of course it wo n't work because i constantly write grey instead of gray . 
  likely lots of people did n't want to say that they would vote for trump , sort of how the fp\u00d6 used to do worse in polls than in actual elections . 
  but of course that 's hard to say . 
  the reason only about 50 % of people in the us vote is very easily explained by their voting system . 
  if you are for instance a democratic voter in texas , there 's no point in voting for a president , since texas is going to have a republican majority anyways , which means that all electoral college votes go to the state 's victor . 
  and since the electoral college decides the president , not the people , you might as well not bother voting . 
  there 's [ flimmit ] ( https://www.flimmit.com/ ) , which is an austrian vod service , but i 'm unsure whether it can be easily accessed outside of austria . 
  has worked for anime , so i guess ? 
  orf does have its tvthek , but it might be geoblocking anyone that 's not from austria ( have n't tried , but they are generally very weird about it , you ca n't get a card to decrypt the orf satellite signal outside of austria ) . 
  english speaking cinemas in vienna usually are pretty filled , and most cinemas show some blockbusters with ov . 
  we were read that book in kindergarten . 
  literally nobody uses t\u00fcte for anything other than getting a cone for their icecream instead of a paper cup . 
  that makes games of `` spot the german '' always incredibly easy  similarly `` kucken/gucken '' is just a german thing . 
  we always use `` schauen '' . 
  for me it 's more difficult to get/hear the difference between the `` a '' and `` e '' sounds of bad and bed . 
  it 's a bit difficult . 
  you could try and look for tv shows from european countries that have english dubs ( or at least subs ) . 
  those wo n't explicitly talk about the culture , but can teach you a lot about it implicitly . 
  for the most part though , i feel like understanding english pronunciation is just a matter of experience . 
  not all of it does make sense necessarily ( it sort of does , if you know the origin of specific words ) , but you will eventually get the hang of it . 
  ... yet !, 
  austria uses `` sackerl '' for the same thing swiss use `` s\u00e4ckli '' , so it 's really not that difficult to understand  germans would use `` t\u00fcte '' , which in austria pretty much always would mean `` cone '' ( for ice cream ) . 
  the `` weirdest '' swiss word i heard is `` m\u00fctschli '' , which contrary to what it sounds like is neither a `` m\u00fctze '' ( `` haube '' in austria ) nor is it cereal , but instead it 's a bun ( `` semmel '' ) . 
  there 's nothing wrong with that , it 's just a difference in word order from what i pointed out as correct . 
  it 's not grammatically correct in prescriptive german grammar of german or austrian variety ( not sure how it is for the swiss ) . 
  it 's grammatically correct in some dialects ( mine included ) . 
   also : hey skyve , you ca n't fool me with that username . 
  hon-forums are pretty dead ( deader than usual atleast ) , hu ? 
  i pretty much have only checked the off-topic forums for 2 years or so and i am still a moderator , but nobody seems to mind . 
  so yeah , pretty dead . 
  that 's the weird thing , i do know the opening of lady oscar , but i do n't think i 've ever seen it . 
  the whole point of the title is to be grammatically incorrect , but grammar does n't really translate  * der dativ is des genitivs tod . 
  ( incorr , book title ) the closest way to translate it to get it accross is probably something like this : * the dative is the genitive 's death . 
  * the dative is the gentitive his death . 
  i just received an sms yesterday , telling me that i won 2,000,000 pounds from some kind of coca cola raffle . 
  checking out the homepage via google resulted in `` site is netherlands based , but most likely from nigeria '' . 
  depends on the age , but when i was younger ( 6ish ) i used to watch nadine , stern der seine , which is essentially an anime about a female batman/zorro during the french revolution . 
  in the series finale marie antoinette is beheaded . 
  i 'm literally the only person that knows that show . 
  probably has to do with it running in the early morning on rtlii . 
  no other child ( that i know ) got up as early as i did i suppose . 
  i also used to watch `` es war einmal das leben '' , which is a french educational cartoon about biology ( orig . 
  there 's also a history version of it and probably others . 
  do n't worry about it , natives are as well . 
  colloquially , the genitive is dying . 
  that sounds like a crime . 
  there 's less of a difference than ae/be for instance , since it 's mostly about exchanging lexical items ( cookies - biscuits for instance , which actually has it 's german equivalence in pl\u00e4tzchen - kekse , although both are used in germany , i have yet to see anyone say pl\u00e4tzchen in austria ) , but essentially never about orthography ( things like neighbour - neighbor , centre - center do n't exist ) . 
  there is also a huge difference in spoken language . 
  when an austrian ( refers to the past it is generally in `` perfekt '' ( `` habe ich doch gesagt '' ) , while germans would use the `` pr\u00e4teritum '' ( simple past ) ( `` sagte ich doch '' ) . 
  important words to know : * marillen - aprikosen ( apricots ) * marmelade - konfit\u00fcre ( jam ) * j\u00e4nner - januar ( january ) * feber - februar ( febuary ) * paradeiser - tomaten ( tomatoes ) * erd\u00e4pfel ( lit . 
  earth/ground apple ) - kartoffel ( potato ),
