it does in german . 
  happy cake-day , bulgaria , i guess . 
  do [ perchten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-christian_alpine_traditions ) count ? 
  sch\u00f6nperchten [ 1 ] ( http://perchtenverein-goldegg.members.cablelink.at/schonperchten_umzug.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://blog.sanktjohann.com/wp-content/uploads/dsc02385-768x1024.jpg ) schiachperchten [ 1 ] ( http://media05.regionaut.meinbezirk.at/2014/11/20/7537655_web.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.lumamedia.at/img/hoeflein_2013.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.eventfotograf.at/event/2007egon/perchtenlauf/images/e327.jpg ), 
  look a lot like [ perchten ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=perchten&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=923&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmip5ovl7mkyaiva9uuch0hrqdo#imgrc=6_pqe7k70hrgtm%3a ) are they a winter / christmas tradition aswell ? 
  i believe they are the second strongest party by now , are n't they ? 
  i allready gave germany hitler for their beethoven . 
  but we can trade a fritzl for your crocodile dundee if you want . 
  i 'd like to ride a donkey taxi :[, 
  wished vienna could get snow like that . 
  and just two ( ? ), 
  years prior , the case p\u0159iklopil / kampusch . 
  makes you wonder how many more are out ( t ) here . 
  i 'm making a wild guess and say rtfer56 is austrian . 
  himmler was n't . 
  as such he would n't nominate himmler . 
  yeah , i think modern poland is like 97 % ethnic poles , 1,5 % slavs , ~ 1 % germans . 
  i do n't think its that far-fetched . 
  afterall , the germans had a division called * legion freies indien / free india legion * along side a * legion freies arabien / free arabian legion * consisting of locals . 
  the germans when fighting in north africa had the [ * legion freies indien * / * free india legion * ] ( http://www.lacanauocean.com/image/0-lacanau-ocean/histoire-lacanau/free-indian-legion/occupation-lacanau-atlantic-wall.jpg ) along side the * legion freies arabien * / * free arabian legion * consisting of volunteers ( i believe ) that hoped the germans could drive out british colonial forces . 
  also the german * africa korps * never made itself guilty of any warcrimes as far as i know ; rommel simply ignored orders to execute british commandos and jewish war-prisoners . 
  so i asume the nazis did n't really develop a `` negative image '' over there along side the fact that they were on the side of the local `` freedom fighters '' at the time . 
  but i 'm just guessing here . 
  do n't care much for classical music but ca n't go into the new year without the radetzky march . 
  you know , i kinda like it . 
  i wish more puplic institutions and ministries had classic or old-timey banners . 
  if our garbage trucks would display a medieval lion with a waste bin , that would be kinda cool . 
  i think he is thinking of [ warhammer orcs / orks ] ( https://youtu.be/vn79fq7cdpq?t=53s ) . 
  today i learned that we share a border with russia . 
  guess the germans * had * to invade poland just to anschluss austria back in the thirties . 
  starving poland ? 
  did i miss something ? 
  i guess these kind of string instruments exist in all sorts of variations in lower europe . 
  wait , do [ jericho trumpets ] ( https://youtu.be/nc9lmr5mjjq?t=10s ) count ? 
  hmm , maybe the [ zither ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kkqdotecdg&amp;ab_channel=runner902 ) ? 
  something more [ modern ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2smtkzk138&amp;ab_channel=musicflo66 ) i guess . 
  a tradition i 'd like to give a shout-out here is turning the city-halls into giant [ advent calendars ] ( http://www.staedte-fotos.de/bilder/wiener-chriskindelmarkt-2007-das-rathaus-10715.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know how common that is internationally , but over here its something tied very closely to christmas markets , in my opinion . 
  my sister works for the anti-doping division of olympic committee . 
  in certain sports * everyone * dopes . 
  there are just sports where you can not compete . 
  if you ever tuned in during a bike race for example , everyone in the top 100 positions is on drugs . 
  anyone able to confirm that this is legit ? 
  have there been reports about things like this happening in the past ? 
  * being forced * does n't mean that there is someone actually * forcing * you . 
  if i lock myself out i 'm * forced * to call the key service . 
  no one is holding a gun up to my head but its simply the only thing to do in that situation . 
  for those interessted . 
  they made it into a pretty good movie . 
  its nuts what these people got away with . 
  [ baader meinhof komplex ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fanvi8-zlsa&amp;ab_channel=mpihomevideo ), 
  hitler did not want war with the us . 
  its propably the last thing he wanted at that stage of the war . 
  if he wanted to wage war on a country he just did it , he did n't bother with a declaration in these cases . 
  whow , rank three and climbing . 
  quite an improvement over the first half of the last century . 
  after coming back from finland , ( my sister married a fin ' ) i realised how few , young children there were around . 
  like , five years or younger ) . 
  in finland there were young mothers with babies and toddlers everywhere . 
  thank you, 
  hitler was n't viennese . 
  he 's from upper austria . 
  any word on if the migrants were armed like some claimed ? 
  one way to scare off refugees i guess . 
  i think the austrian flag is the second oldest in the world or something . 
  at least thats what i learned back in the day . 
  reminds me of * trotz * in german which translate into * ( de ) spite * . 
  horseshoe theory ? 
  would explain the german lyrics in the intro though . 
  well , nothing new there . 
  i 'm sure you know the numbers of the soviet-finnish winter war . 
  i think i 'd still take my chances with a pack of wolves over a bear . 
  atleast you can out-climb a wolf . 
  * `` there are markings . 
  it 's some form of elvish , i ca n't read it . 
  its literally 50:50 right now , with van der bellen leading with like twentysixhundred votes . 
  got the same for 10 $ but in return they get to send me an ad every couple weeks via sms . 
  pretty sure its the same case in austria . 
  i know they were the very first to launch an expedition to japan were they clashed with the local samurai . 
  impressed by the portuguese 's superior plate steel , the japanese collected every armour piece they could get their hands on , [ converting ] ( https://periklisdeligiannis.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/morion-samurai.jpg ) them into unique looking [ sets of samurai armour ] ( http://i.imgur.com/w4ozhsj.jpg ) . 
  are you replying to the right person ?

  thats from our president 's party .

  * you 're, 
  hofer is a member of ` marko-germania ' , a brotherhood/fraternity ( there does n't seem to be a good translation ) whos members dream of a ` united , germanic fatherland ' and consider the idea of austria as its own , independed nation ' a revisionist fiction implanted into people 's minds since 1945 ' . 
  if he is n't a nazi , he atleast surrounds himself with such . 
  we can import pizza . 
  we ca n't import vienna . 
  i feel ripped off . 
  we really wan na surrender vienna for a bit more of the alps and still no sea access ? 
  also ` bad spencer ' is too great of a pun . 
  literally the most vile shite i 've ever read on reddit came after the results of the austrian election ( everything from how ` women should n't be allowed to vote ' to death threats ) . 
  considering their hopes for le pen , i 'm expecting an absolute new low from that crowd . 
  case kampusch * and * case fritzl .
