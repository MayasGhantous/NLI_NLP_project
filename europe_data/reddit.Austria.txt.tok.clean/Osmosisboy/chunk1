yeah you ca n't ` digitally sign ' in blood , can you ? 
  either she is politicly tone-deaf , or my perception of the public reception of ceta is severely wrong . 
  for the sake of completeness i 've translated your comment into german . 
  no need to thank me . 
  i hate axis that do n't start at zero . 
  when you * have * to do it in a graphic at least draw some attention to it . 
  i do n't think we can ever get truly competitive ( on an open market , with little regulation ) to asian countries when it comes to cheap labour , and i hope europe wo n't try to . 
  in my view tpp and its impact on the american job marked have shown that some degree of protectionism is required in any case to prevent migration of manufacturing jobs . 
  so that would be a good time to figure out a way how to make a machine-tax work . 
  maybe some kind of robot-tax or working-machine-tax is the way to go . 
  this could also make human workers competitive for a while yet . 
  do n't you mean to say it 's not a * hollow * threat ? 
  i think it 's very much a threat , and i do n't see how it could n't be one . 
   looking at projected gdp growth it just does not seem worth the risk . 
  i just ca n't really quantify how much the eu exposes itself to lawsuits from corporations with this trade agreement , or how much impact this risk will have on government policies in the future . 
  it 's always about nato . 
  wtf ? 
  i honestly have to say seeing how isds morphs into a permanent tribunal with all the accompanying changes that go with that is immensely interesting . 
  those fines , if big enough to be felt , will make countries change laws . 
  in this way isds rulings can change laws indirectly - or even have an impact on how policies are written in the future , as the governments try to take past rulings into account so as to not get fined in the first place . 
  but this is not how isds will work in ceta :  the new investment protection system in ceta :  * breaks from the current ad hoc arbitration system by ** establishing a permanent and institutionalised ** dispute settlement tribunal with members appointed by the eu and canada * establishes an appeal system comparable to what is found in domestic legal systems * has a code of conduct for members of the tribunal * ensures government control over the members of the tribunal * ensures full transparency of proceedings * bans frivolous claims . 
  so it 's not ad hoc . 
  and :  * a ** permanent tribunal ** , nominated by the parties to the agreement will hear cases for breaches of the investment protection standards in ceta . 
  * cases will be heard by divisions of the tribunal , composed on the basis of a random selection of three members , one from the eu , one from canada , and a presiding member from a third country . 
  so you kind of have to submit to their jurisdiction beforehand and the panel is chosen randomly ( but out of a pool ) . 
  [ -  source < - ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/questions-and-answers/#ceta-improve-existing-rules ), 
  you 're right all the rulings in favor of corporations i 've seen have good justifications . 
  maybe the fears about this are largely unwarranted , since this has been in practice for so long and seems to work pretty satisfactory . 
  but what still worries me are the cases the government actually won - for example [ philip morris v. uruguay ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philip_morris_v._uruguay ) ( that 's the one where a tobacco company tried to fight against health laws ) . 
  i think this shows that companies are willing to use arbitration courts to try and influence policy makers in the government , even if they are pretty obviously in the wrong . 
  it 's just that so much power resides with these courts . 
  a handful of people decide if a country can influence its market for cigarettes . 
  i do n't think a country should subject itself to this when no major economic gains are expected . 
  for me it seems like arbitration courts are more of a bonus to companies - sure it 's a good thing to have , but i do n't see it sparking new economic investments and activities from them , because the big corporations who would use this system have enough financial backing to swallow losses from a deal gone sour ( even if the government was unfair ) anyway , so they already take every business opportunity they can . 
  sad !, 
  ca n't they get into trouble when they disregard those regulations ? 
  like a lawsuit or the voting gets ruled as void or something like that ? 
  i do n't doubt that afghanistan is unsafe . 
  `` this particular agreement allows european governments to ride straight through all the argumentation that 's been made over the ** past 15 years that it 's not safe to return people at the * moment * . 
  ** '' 15 years is a hell of a long moment . 
  try this analogy but swap out the gun with a simple pen . 
  you give away free pens and someone decides to stab someone with the pen . 
  now how much responsibility lies with you ? 
  i think it 's much less clear . 
  anyway analogies are tricky things and it 's dangerous to try and argue about an issue with analogies . 
  edit : about your point with the `` free wifi '' - sign : the eu courts ruling was about businesses so that is a separate issue . 
  but it 's an interesting point . 
  oh i can access street view and look around * other * countries . 
  they just did n't drive around in austria with their car because we made some law that dissuaded them from doing that . 
  it infuriates me whenever i go camping and would really like to just take a quick look to get a sense of the place . 
  nah man , i ai n't playing that pokemon shit . 
  and austria shut down google street view for me . 
  so now i ca n't go explore every city in austria from my home and hungarians ca n't get a convenient ride . 
  those examples are n't exactly what i 'd call an optimal solution . 
  but i imagine that if you are a bigger player you maybe can get those corporations moving in the directions you want them to . 
  and not simply have to shut them down cause they give you the finger and can simply go elsewhere . 
  this is why i think the eu is important . 
  who on a purely national level could even hope to play in this league ? 
  but they need to make sure the lobbying going on in brussels is transparent so the integrity of the european commission is beyond doubt . 
  as it is everyone always fears the worst and is looking for that shadowy figure in the corner , pulling strings . 
  that reads as if they are playing for time , to reach an understanding behind the curtain . 
   chinese companies were often able to sell steel abroad at a loss because they received heavy government subsidies , such as having the communist government pay the entire power bills for steel mills . 
   `` today we have signed an agreement with china to eliminate export subsidies that the united states challenged because they are prohibited under wto rules , '' u.s. trade representative michael froman said . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.nwitimes.com/business/steel/china-to-end-subsidies-on-steel-exports/article_daa99ef9-1231-5d32-a40e-4bb8f0a1783f.html ), 
  from the article :  turkey has yet to make a formal extradition request to the us for gulen . 
  do they want him , or not ? 
  i think i need more context . 
  they fuck up plans for people in london to raise awareness for problems in the us . 
  how can you even find a handful of people to do this with you and who believe this is a great course of action ? 
  you criticize them , even only indirectly , they immediately want to insult you on the international stage . 
  how 's that about foreign relation policy . 
  just wait for the presidential election in october . 
  i 'd guess you 'll want to rethink that statement then . 
  ^ ^ but i think the current chancellor is doing a good job , so far . 
  i 'd say he is a pragmatic first . 
  and i think the reason he seeks to better relations with hungary is primarily to have more options for later should the situation come to a head again . 
  there are n't many good reasons to bash the hungarian government . 
  appeasing once base can be a good political move , but if it makes future important negotiations that much harder i do n't think it 's the smart thing to do . 
  so him normalizing relations with hungary is not due to pressure , i think . 
  what i 've seen from him leads me to believe he 's going to do what he genuinely believes to be in the best interest of austria . 
  for example he wanted the job market to become more accessible to asylum seekers , and advocated for this openly with the argument that everyone stood to lose when those people could only loiter around and could slip into criminality . 
  i think this shows he is not afraid of getting attacked , because just saying something like that in the current political climate is an open invitation for an attack from the right . 
  his political career is still young and it will be interesting to see how he handles the pressure with the parliamentary elections coming up in 2018 . 
  i feel turkey is overshadowing any dealings with hungary for now . 
  kern made a critical statement about the pro erdogan rallies in austria and that got decent coverage . 
  whatever he ( or the foreign and interior ministers ) does about hungary barely makes public waves here . 
  that might change though if migrants are lines up at their border and hungary cracks down on them . 
  i think that that will certainly start another public debate . 
  i think many people see the somewhat new direction the government takes as stemming from hofer 's ( and the fp\u00d6s ) criticism , so any positives are attributed to them . 
  you know , i think i prefer not having a volcano anywhere near me . 
  i hear they can explode or something . 
  keeping people who have no current assignment on the payroll for 20 years hardly sounds like a workable solution to me . 
   even those western european nations which have seen war , their borders have not changed that much \u0ca0_\u0ca0, 
  well , i disagree . 
  if you know about something on this scale you absolutely have to report it . 
  if you see a car in a no-park-zone , not blocking anything , and you call the police - that would be snitching . 
  mostly we have sown sympathy and leniency , so we should have a nice harvest . 
  lets see how this plays out . 
  who makes the pastries now , ey ' france ? 
  it 's okay to find this funny .
