  we 're a strong independent nation who do n't need no ships . 
  & nbsp ; ships are stupid anyway . 
  hear , hear !, 
  yeah , but the article is so detailed that while it 's technically labeled ` news ' it really is more than that , so i think the violation of the ' 3 month old news ' - rule should be ignored . 
  i 've just read the whole thing and it 's one of the most interesting articles i have ever come across here . 
  * elating, 
   the swedish national council for crime prevention has conducted two studies into the representation of people from foreign backgrounds among crime suspects , the most recent in 2005 . 
  i 'd question how relevant the findings from 2005 really are anyway , considering that the foreign backgrounds have changed and 12 years ( some of them with really high immigration ) have passed . 
  but i think doing ( and communicating ) the research is a very important step to solving this problem , or even identifying if there is a problem/what the problem is . 
  i hope there are more studies carried out currently . 
  i get the feeling this ` bill ' might be the main thing where negotiation takes place . 
  since the lines concerning the single market are pretty much set maybe this way there is more to talk about . 
  `` everyone who wants to deepen defense cooperation show your hands . '', 
  & nbsp ; ^ o ^ o ^ o / ^ o / ^ o ^ \\ o ^ o ^ o ^ o `` okay , we 'll meet mondays and thursdays afternoon in room 234b . 
  to the rest of you : i 'll see you when i see you . '', 
  hahahahahahaha - wait . 
  this * is * satire , right ? 
  but the government - maybe not in case of one country alone , but referring to the eu - has the power to change the framework under which billionaires , stock holders , banks and so forth operate . 
  if our politicians identified the problem it is their turn to communicate it to the populace and to take meaningful action . 
  if ' billionaires , stock holders and banks ' are the real problem i do n't think politicians are aware - it certainly is n't communicated right now that this is a glaring problem and that there are new regulations needed . 
  ( at least not in a way that i would hear it ), 
   eu creates a single market with china/india i find that hard to believe . 
  do you mean a simple free-trade-agreement ? 
  i know my view is narrow and i do n't know all the facts but it feels like ` economy wise ' nothing ever gets fixed for good and new problems crop up every year . 
  it 's hard to trust those in charge when you grow ever more frustrated with the situation and even harder when there is such broad dissent among supposed professionals in the field as to how to go about fixing it . 
  build the glass dome !, 
  ^ ^ ___ ^ ^ ^ europe, 
  one problem ( in addition to the ones i 've listed ) is that i could not tell you what a clear left - or right-wing position regarding housing , health , crime or even economics would be - * especially * in an international context . 
  the left/right label also suggests that there are only two ways to approach an issue - the left-wing and the right-wing way , which is not true at all . 
  also sometimes certain attributes are ascribed to mostly right/left , e.g. 
  ` family values ' , ` patriotism ' or some such , suggesting the ` other side ' does n't embrace those things or sees them as negative . 
  one of the things this does is fostering an ` us versus them mentality ' which is poisonous for meaningful political discourse . 
  i get that it 's hard to stay informed on every important decision that is made but when deciding what the solution to an issue should be you have to examine the whole thing , and not simply state `` i prefer left-wing solutions from left wing parties , so that 's whom i 'm going to vote for '' . 
  could we leave the left vs right bullshit to countries with only 2 political parties , please ? 
  for one , it 's polarizing and since stances on issues can shift rapidly it also does n't help to make things clearer . 
  edit : fixed grammar ( i hope ), 
  if this proofs effective maybe the eu can pick up on the idea . 
   however , johnson 's comments came only 24 hours after the prime minister , theresa may , had reminded her cabinet ministers in her lancaster house speech to show restraint by warning `` any stray word '' could make securing a brexit deal more difficult . 
  too soon . 
   ( ... ) the lights would go out in our biggest manufacturing sector , food will rot in the fields and britain will lose the ability to produce and process its own food.that is not what a successful brexit looks like . 
  kinda reads like : & nbsp ;  and the unclean bird spoke to me and said , `` what are you doing , abraham , on the holy heights , where no one eats or drinks , nor is there upon them food for men . 
  but these all will be consumed by fire and ascend to the height , they will destroy you . '', 
  and it came to pass when i saw the bird speaking i said this to the angel : `` what is this , my lord ? '', 
  and he said , `` that 's not the brexit i voted for . '', 
  build the linguistic wall !, 
  which is why i think that him saying it 's ` no pressing matter ' sounds a bit shortsighted . 
   eurogroup head jeroen dijsselbloem did mention that getting a deal is no pressing matter as greece will not have liquidity issues before summer . 
  it 's called the ` hand-to-mouth ' - financial model . 
  yes , as far as i know , though there could be some regional differences between east and west austria . 
  a semmel looks like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/kaisersemmel-.jpg ) ( at least in east-austria ) . 
  yep , it 's semmel-area . 
  is he ... is he mocking us ? 
  that you even commented about the police kind of implies it ( for me ) . 
  or what was it that you wanted to say ? 
  just a random piece of information ? 
  i do n't want to argue , just wanted to communicate my perception . 
  rank 14 for austria ... i wonder if this was recent enough to include that presidential election schlamperei . 
  ' 6.88 ' in ` political culture ' is a comparatively disastrous score too , but i can believe that no doubt . 
  if it makes us just a tiny bit different from germans then living with the idiocy , that ` deca ' clearly is , is well worth it in my books . 
  in german we call them `` nadelbaum '' which literally translates as `` needle-tree '' . 
  though i do n't know if we just call them so in austria - since i discovered the ` semmel vs br\u00f6tchen ' thing everything is possible . 
  do n't be ridiculous , he just made a joke . 
  the name ` black forest ' stems from a practice in the 15th century when the germans penned up all black people in and around the forest - an early form of racial segregation .

  being self-deprecating is no blank cheque in a discussion . 
  i think people just do n't agree with your opinion and think your arguments are poor . 
  just watch interviews with him . 
  for one his positions on issues keep changing , he lacks a certain moral standard and his statements are rambling . 
  yeah , that would have shut him up for sure .

   the cooperation agreement we have signed today will allow us to build on the areas that we already engage with the afghan authorities on , such as human development , anti-corruption , state building , and the rule of law , as well as ** cooperation on migration ** . 
  this cooperation includes that afghanistan accepts the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers , of which there are about 80.000 in the eu . 
  make us proud .

  i had a lot of comic books about them as a kid and whenever i catch them broadcast on tv i still watch it - not the feature films with real actors though , those are a crime against humanity .

  voters think it 's politically expedient to lack moral integrity - as long as she plays for the right ` team ' . 
  to my knowledge it has been a long time since gates called the shots at microsoft . 
  it may seem inevitable but it really is up to us to make the red line known . 
  i do n't want information about me collected without specific reasons , that is where i stand at the moment . 
  the government is very much in favor , but they know the population is very skeptical and has built up a pretty broad opposition . 
  i 'm just gon na leave [ this ] ( https://petapixel.com/2016/08/02/26-photos-show-war-changed-syria/ ) and [ this ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/12146082/what-has-been-the-real-cost-of-syrias-civil-war.html ) , here . 
   once boasting one of the highest literacy rates in the middle east before the war , figures last year showed more than 45 per cent of children were no longer attending school . 
  the report 's authors warned this would have a `` dramatic impact '' on syria 's future . 
  guess they should have folded that katana blade one more time . 
  they are only leaving the eu . 
  no one promised they 'd stop blaming the eu . 
  nice . 
  shame the article is so short though , some more context would be great , or an explanation of how they did cut the deficit down . 
  yeah , but do n't forget that there were two parties in power 2000-2003 , and three in 2004-2007 . 
  the others should take their share of responsibility too . 
  edit : fixed grammar . 
  our judiciary seems sure money flowed somewhere but i think they 've given up on trying to get to the persons involved , they 've tried to , but did n't get anyone convicted , and instead shifted onto airbus to get money back . 
  there 's an ongoing lawsuit in germany which austria is going to join .
