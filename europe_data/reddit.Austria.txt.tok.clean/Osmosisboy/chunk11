  as i understand it the main thing austria wants to prove is that the contract over the fighter was made in bad faith because airbus knew they could n't follow the delivery time and they sent us older-type fighter which they promised to update ( but knew they could n't for the money they projected ) . 
  also much lauded reciprocity business deals apparently did not happen to the promised extent . 
  they are investigating since 2007 and for ten years of work we so far do n't have many results to show for it . 
  for one i would not trust , for example , a us court to be absolutely impartial when ruling on a eu corporation , and i would imagine vice versa there 'd also be a matter of doubt . 
  also it 's not a good idea to have eu courts overrule national governments in favor of corporations , * even if it is the correct ruling * . 
  can you imagine the blame that 'd be lobbed onto the eu 's doorstep , just because national governments do n't want it on them ? 
   country - usa , next steps - the talks are on hold until there is more precision as regards the approach that will be developed by the new us administration . 
  * diplomatic burn * . 
  hehehe . 
  would you agree in principle that countries have to follow contracts they sign with other entities and should not be able to brush them aside at will ? 
  implementation is of course a huge issue and we should be very critical every step of the way . 
  but i myself agree with the principle . 
  how would they ` fuck the countries that do n't approve their projects ' ? 
  what are you on about ? 
  the ` nuke denmark ' bit is hilarious . 
  also good job on the voice . 
  if it is in conflict with the european convention on human rights , can this be fought against in an eu court ? 
  did i hear someone say deus vult ? 
  no , i 'm not fine with the situation at hand . 
  but lets not forget that greece can just do all these things you proposed and they chose not to . 
  they must understand their own situation . 
  i 'm just trying to identify the magnitude of problems greece would face when doing those measures you 've mentioned . 
  you 're neither one of the people who fucked it up , nor one of those who will see it get fixed . 
  duties wo n't solve this as they increase prices for consumers even further . 
  and we 're talking about food and basic products here , people are going to panic if they ca n't afford that . 
  what you can get is a humanitarian crisis and an unstable country . 
  of course everyone would then feel that in order to survive the country would need to change in a fundamental way , so hopefully they would unite and maybe they could push through that . 
  but there 's an esa sticker and a couple different flags on it ? 
   ( year 1667 ) february -- the first theatre in scandinavia , opens in lejonkulan and bollhuset in stockholm , sweden . 
  what a feat indeed . 
  i applaud your commitment to the arts . 
  here , take a [ beethoven ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/beethoven.jpg ) . 
  oh i just assumed they were , because the colour is kind of yellowish to me . 
  so i guess i have to admit - the swedes did n't best you that time . 
   the new u.s. ambassador to the united nations , nikki haley , has expressed `` strong condemnation of russia 's actions '' in eastern ukraine and warned that ** ukraine-related sanctions ** against russia will not be lifted until crimea is returned to kyiv . 
  in the provided video she does not use the term ' ** ukraine ** - related sanctions ' , but says :  '' ( ... ) crimea is a part of ukraine . 
  our ** crimea-related sanctions ** will remain in place until russia returns control of the peninsula to ukraine ( ... ) '' [ ` crimea-related sanctions ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_sanctions_during_the_ukrainian_crisis#sanctions_against_crimea ) are sanctions imposed against crimea ( probably , but sadly the ambassador is not clear on this ) and are separate from those against russia . 
  why the article seems to confuse this , i do n't know . 
  but none of the provided quotes in it talk about ' ** ukraine ** - related sanctions ' ( which would presumably include those imposed on russia ) . 
  so maybe the journalist made a mistake . 
  the sanctions imposed by the eu are always in force for 6 months and then have to be agreed upon by the member states to be prolonged . 
  is this the way the us does it ? 
  because what i meant when i said `` if he extends the sanctions ... '' was that if he has to prolong it too - and he does it - that would then be something tangible . 
  ordinarily the eu would always issue a statement when they prolong the sanctions to declare why they do it and what they want to achieve with them , so that there is more clarity about the situation . 
  on the whole if trump decides to take a firmer stance against russia , and if he does not waver , i 'd be glad . 
  the problem is his credibility . 
  he has assumed so many positions , with such varying and at times contrary goals , by now it 's almost irrelevant what he says . 
  if he extends the sanctions on russia and couples it with an official statement regarding crimea , then we know something . 
  i 'd be very wary to prematurely praise trump . 
  in ~ 1150 sweden cut norway off . 
  i 've seen that done before in settlers of catan . 
  what a dick move . 
  another crisis averted . 
  well done everyone , case closed . 
  ^ ^ right ? 
  nah man , write about interesting stats , like streaks and so forth , beforehand ; makes it more interesting to watch . 
  it was just a joke . 
  ^ ^ edit : terminated a rogue comma . 
  edit2 : the comma is back and i inserted a semicolon . 
  i 'm drunk btw . 
  what the fuck am i doing ... 
  i always translated ` hate speech ' as ` verhetzung ' , i thought it meant pretty much the same even though it 's no literal translation . 
  but i could be wrong . 
  there is now the word [ hassrede ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hassrede ) but this is just a literal translation of ` hate speech ' , invented just for that term . 
  did you just jinx the launch ? 
  really ?!?!?!?!, 
  do n't know much , but their flag is a huge plus . 
  actually i find the way their democracy works fascinating . 
  though i have to admit i do n't understand it all that well . 
  yes , i do n't think this would be ` hate speech ' . 
  also in austria [ `` vort\u00e4uschung einer mit strafe bedrohten handlung '' ] ( https://www.jusline.at/298_vort%c3%a4uschung_einer_mit_strafe_bedrohten_handlung_stgb.html ) is only punished with a maximum of half a year in prison or a fine . 
  this should maybe be reassessed . 
  if you reach many people with it you can get up to three years in prison . 
  if it 's only a small group of people the sentence is up to two years . 
  if someone is incited and acts on your ` hate speech ' you get at least half a year , up to five years . 
  yes . 
  i 'm curious about the sentence something like this could be carrying . 
  i was talking about conventional war between countries . 
  wait ... austria does n't share a border with germany anymore ... this ... feels ... great . 
  finally people will be able to tell the difference . 
  you do n't win wars just over the air tho , and even the f-35 has its limits regarding stealth . 
  i think stealth is important but how much money is it really worth if you also have to improve the military in a multitude of other areas ? 
  it 's no good if your aviation is top notch when other aspects are severely lacking and so it might be preferable to not go the ` high end-be all end all ' route and just buy middle of the line stuff . 
   after passing worst surveillance law in a democracy ^ [ citation ^ needed ] , ( ... ), 
  i do n't know about the existence of a great many fantastic things and beings , but my inability to disprove them is not a reason for believing in them . 
  you wrote * everything * has a cause and then mentioned a ` final cause ' - which presumably would have no cause ? 
  i just ca n't follow the logic . 
  if you exclude this ` final cause ' from ` everything ' - which you must , else it would need a cause - then you just redefined the word ` everything ' . 
  this would then turn your first statement that ` everything has a cause ' into ` everything , except one thing has a cause ' , which is a premise that no longer appears self evident and which you would have to explain first . 
  seeking an explanation for god in logic is something that 's very interesting to me , and which many famous thinkers tried . 
  it 's okay to not know something . 
  i 'd rather accept that i do n't know something , or have only weak theories that are probably false for something , than to think up a mystical explanation with a framework that ca n't be tested ( or is not allowed to be tested ) . 
  that 's not to say i 'm not curious about those things you 've mentioned - i very much am . 
  but for me the ` why ? 
  because god . ', 
  answers ring very hollow , and they do not satisfy me . 
  i ca n't assume the point of view of a religious person who may be satisfied , even only to a degree perhaps , with these mystical answers - i can not imagine being that person and what ` truth ' means for him or how he feels when thinking about god . 
  because i can not truly assume this other point of view of the universe , people who can , puzzle me . 
  edit : added one word . 
  i 'm not a law expert but this is the relevant section of the `` verbotsgesetz '' in this case : ( i google translated it )  \u00a7 3d .
