  anyone who , in public or in the presence of a number of people , in printed works , disseminated writings or ** pictorial representations ** , invites to one of the actions forbidden pursuant to \u00a7 1 or \u00a7 3 , or tries to mislead them , ** especially glorifies ** or promotes the aims of the nsdap , its institutions or measures , is punished with imprisonment of five to ten years , if the offender is not a heavily condemned crime , if the perpetrator is punished , or if he is employed for up to twenty years . 
  original in german :  \u00a7 3d . 
  i think his behavior is odd enough that the police should question him . 
  in light of what the nsdap stood for i think it 's good to take it serious and not trivialize , especially given austria 's involvement . 
  joking about , or trivializing the nazi era is something that 's taboo in public life at least in front of people you do n't know well . 
  it just is n't done . 
  the gottkanzler schulz wo n't lose to him . 
  \u1d4f\u1d49\u1da6\u1db0\u1d49 \u1d47\u02b3\u1d49\u1d50\u02e2\u1d49\u1db0, 
  yeah he only dressed up as hitler and took a picture outside the guys birthplace . 
  no red flags there . 
  this is out of the blue , but man i just got ta say something ... that isle of man flag is truly something special . 
  glorious . 
  you 'd need a phd in memeiosophy to fully appreciate that argument . 
  to my chagrin i have to admit that i somehow never thought that their faith must be as fundamental to them , as my need for reality to be testable and logically sound , is to me . 
  it 's a sobering thought and very interesting . 
  edit : put in a comma somewhere . 
  i like it better that way  . 
   similarly , you can believe in human rights , humanity , or something like that , it does not exist . 
  that is n't really a good comparison for me . 
  i * believe * we should have a set of rights applicable to all humans but i 'm well aware they are n't some fundamental , irrevocable part of the cosmos , and that we could choose to have different laws or even no laws . 
  i also know that my believe we should have them is not enough to make them exist , that requires action . 
  the word * believe * has a different meaning here than in a religious context . 
  at the end of every article dealing with religion and especially with radicalization involving religion i always go away with understanding it * less * . 
  because i 'm not religious i just ca n't fathom what goes on in those heads . 
  even just regular people , who say they believe in a god puzzle me . 
  are they just paying lip service ? 
  do they * truly * believe ? 
  how can they , if there is so little credible evidence ? 
  i ca n't prove it 's * impossible * there is a god , but that in no way means you have to believe in him . 
  it 's just so strange to me , i genuinely struggle to put myself in those shoes and i do n't think i really can . 
  for a time i just thought something like : `` those people lack social and economic opportunities , so they turn somewhere they think they can attain something . '', 
  but i 'm not sure i believe that anymore . 
  maybe they have an inner need for ` religion ' , with it 's social structure and ( from my perspective ) blind faith which i just never had and so have no hope of really comprehending . 
  i fear that without that comprehension lasting solutions to religious radicalization will continue to elude us for a long time . 
  there 's still hope , i hear the sea levels are rising . 
  the rhythm at the start sounds similar to me . 
  god damn , had me worried for a second . 
  what are the times with the least moderators online ? 
  and a completely unrelated question - what 's the best time to shitpost and not have mods take notice ? 
  that sarcastic headline is coloring your post from the get go and does not facilitate an open mind for the reader . 
  i think it 's a sub optimal way to lead others into a subject that 's clearly important to you . 
   ` thanks , / r/europe , for crying nazism and accusing croatia of being a fascist state ' i take it an official europe subreddit post called croatia fascist ? 
  or are you doing exactly the thing you 're outraged about ? 
  what the hell , why did i just run outside and buy a car ? 
  witchcraft !, 
  ahhhhh , they just do n't make commercials like they used to anymore ... 
  you 're right , the eu 's position would be something better communicated through back channels . 
  i guess this is where a us-ambassador to the eu would come in handy . 
  edit : wait ... i think we should have our own ambassador regardless , right ? 
  maybe it 's just dick waving on both sides . 
  ( which is n't a good sign ), 
  at least we then would have dealt with somewhat disentangling our financial market from the us and that would be one problem less in the future . 
  if both options ( either sticking with the us while they do stupid shit , or severing ties somewhat ) are equally bad i 'd prefer the one lending at least a modicum of control to us . 
  the us has demonstrated what kind of person they are willing to elect , and the voters have indicated they want to walk a more nationalistic route . 
  i do n't think simply shaking our heads and saying to ourselves ` well we are fucked either way ' while doing nothing , is a good problem solving strategy . 
  * technically * underwater , is the best kind of being underwater for countries , i guess . 
  that * is * unexpected . 
  should n't this all be underwater ? 
  you 'd think that those countries with an abundance of oil would make the switch to renewables last . 
  i mean , if demand for oil plummets you 'd still have the infrastructure for your own domestic energy needs . 
  or maybe plastics alone will hold the price for oil at a level where it 's not economic enough to consume for energy ? 
  just something i find curious . 
  edit : looking at a map , saudi arabia is in prime location for solar energy . 
  must be * really * cost effective down there . 
  probably ran out of gdp to map before crossing into russia . 
  those bastards turned [ vienna ] ( https://youtu.be/enetopnpiii?t=104 ) into [ baltimore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p0hg3sd0-e ) . 
  ... i 'm gon na go and watch the wire again . 
  where the fuck are the mods ? 
  get that monster out of here !, 
  we 've been stopped a long time ago = /, 
  i dunno ... invading france ? 
  i think we should invade , or annex , or whatever it 's called nowadays . 
  when can the eu army be readied ? 
  i read that they air something today at 2200 in their show . 
  looks like someone else was faster . 
  edit : seems like this is indeed theirs . 
  shame , i do n't think it 's very good . 
  but the question was ` all further migration from mainly muslim countries should be stopped ' . 
  there are ways besides a flat out ` ban ' to achieve that - at least that 's what i would think when asked that question . 
  that 's nice of you to say but you should really come and take a look into our collective basement to get the whole picture ... on second thought maybe you should n't ... 
  anyway you have access to the sea so we 'll be forever envious . 
   there is no `` arabia '' . 
  check the map . 
  no [ arabia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arabian_peninsula ) ? 
  if your map is missing the [ balkans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans ) too , you should consider getting a new one . 
  i 'm a simple austrian , i see mozart i tell everyone hitler was german . 
   i always get the feeling he is trying to con me . 
  ... well negative . 
  i like people with power over me to be crystal clear in their intentions . 
  when i let go of my prejudices about him , sit down and watch one of his speeches or interviews while trying to listen to only what he is saying - not what * i think he means * but the information he manages to convey to me - i always get the feeling he is trying to con me . 
  he is so vague - trying to appeal , to have me find anything in what he is saying that lets me go along with him . 
  that 's how i primarily form my opinion about him . 
  just observe * him * , not the various reports about him done by others . 
  sure , everybody loves a middleman . 
  ca n't stop watching the livestream , it 's so amazing . 
   germans and russians have a long-standing `` spiritual '' connection as two nations with a preference for the romantic over the rational . 
  - aboutdesouffle ----------  could you elaborate a bit on this please ? - kitkhat we 're not talking about ` german romanticism ' , as in the specific intellectual movement . 
  it was only really a thing in german speaking countries anyway and would not explain a ` connection ' between russians and germans - which i did not bring up originally , and do n't believe is really there . 
  i thought the contention was about a [ romanticized ] ( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/romanticize ) worldview in the past . 
  and this was certainly the case for example in world war i and later for the visions the nazis had about germany and it 's people .
