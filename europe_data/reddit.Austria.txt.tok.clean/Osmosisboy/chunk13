  no , i saw it as an example for romantic views in the history of germany . 
  seems more like denial than a reasonable explanation of his behavior to me . 
  obsolete things get replaced , not reformed . 
  what he wrote is n't really outrageous . 
  for example the notion of a ' 1000 year reich ' can be called romantic for sure . 
  second funniest behind netherlands maybe  edit : just saw the swiss one . 
  i 'll sadly have to downgrade you to third . 
  that 's not how i perceived the exchange - to me king 's statement is coming across as an argument in favor of politic leadership dominated by whites , although i admit he is n't quite clear in what he is saying and it is only implied , which is why he absolutely * needed * to elaborate . 
  i agree the bearded man 's wording at the start was very ham-fisted and not conducive to a rational discussion - it does n't excuse king 's statement though . 
  but how would one take differences in spending power into account ? 
  is this really ` geo-blocking ' of the traditional kind ? 
  they are scared to go to jail and ran out of places to hide . 
   `` the fight against corruption needs to be advanced , not undone , '' said european commission head jean-claude juncker . 
  boy , he sure knows how to tie his shoes . 
  what a bold statement . 
  oh god i 'm dying . 
  always refreshing to see people actually give a shit about their country . 
  those two groups may have significant overlap though . 
  seems dangerous , better not get too close . 
  ( sorry i 'm so bad at jokes qq ), 
  what 's that blue country it 's bordering on ? 
  that 's huge . 
  south tyrol seems pretty nice . 
  i 'm not angry . 
  [ no , those are n't tears .

  yes , but they can surely explain how this is in the best interest of romania , they are corrupt * politicians * after all , not simple thieves . 
  how are romanian media outlets taking all this ? 
  yeah , they know how to bank for sure . 
  but we could try them in an european court of justice then . 
  they are free to not give a shit while locked up in jail . 
  hmmmm , could the eu put anti corruption laws into european law ? 
  would this be a good idea ? 
  what is it with french politicians and embezzlement ? 
  please , think about the kids . 
  they should call the day brexit is triggered ` mayday ', 
  human dignity trumps freedom of speech here . 
  i 'm aware this is n't easy and brings its own set of problems but ultimately i like it better . 
  nah man , they can still criticize despite their own problems . 
  i have read it completely and ` state religion of atheism ' sounds still ludicrous to me . 
  probably because i do n't see how atheism can fall into the definition of religion . 
  lets say this is true . 
  what i meant with :  there are so many factors contributing to intelligence prohibiting testing this directly is that there would be a myriad of things with high impact on intelligence in play here . 
  bad or nonexistent schools in africa , deficiencies in nutrition and no societal pressure to * be * intelligent are just some of them . 
  those things would be on top of any effect complexion would have . 
  hence you ca n't draw the conclusion that it is complexion effecting the iq from ` africans have an average iq below 80 ' . 
  this is what is meant when i say testing * directly * is not possible . 
  there simply is no test group available to draw data from . 
  ( such a group would ideally differ only in complexion , everything else must be the same . 
  imagine a new york where everything is the same but everyone is black - such a city could be compared to the real city of new york to find out what changes come from different complexion.such a thing is simply not found on earth . ), 
  and with no biological mechanism discovered that would explain how skin colour could even effect the brain the default stance is that complexion has no effect . 
  because the complexion of the people who shaped our civilization in the past should not inform our opinion on what makes up a good government . 
  and so his statement is attributed to racism , because he does not explain his logic on why it should ( it could be examined and found to be flawed , or maybe he is right ) and does not follow up with an explanation to this statement ( maybe he himself knows such an explanation would out him as racist , which is not accepted openly in society ) . 
  if complexion has no effect on your ability as a politician then the ratios of skin colours of politicians in high office should match pretty closely with those of the population . 
  if they do not there are many different avenues to take to explain this divide . 
  one of those is pervading racism . 
  probably there are many reasons intertwined . 
  if credible ( ` main stream ' - as in broadly accepted to be scientifically sound ) science findings ever suggest a biological link between complexion and intelligence we will be in * a lot * of trouble ( civil unrest is what i 'm thinking ) . 
  so far it does not , in part because there are so many factors contributing to intelligence prohibiting testing this directly , and a biological mechanism linking complexion to brain development seems unlikely . 
  i have to say i 'm disappointed about this . 
  everything but the stuff about deactivated weapons and maybe alarm guns seems beside the point . 
  i thought the eu recognized that its citizens want them to focus on big stuff like income inequality , unemployment and immigration . 
  this just sucks . 
  what exactly will this legislation do to you personally ? 
  i 'm interested in what you ca n't do when this goes into effect , but can do now . 
  that such wild and beautiful creations are domesticated into unnatural [ abominations ] ( https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/g/02/aplusautomation/vendorimages/0c7c7979-fde6-4607-bdcb-da46a080cf82.jpg._cb314517057_.jpg ) makes me profoundly sad . 
  i do n't get the picture . 
  was n't he a general or something ? 
  generals are soldiers . 
  if it 's so shitty , why do n't you conquer it ? 
  `` indivisible and inseparable '' ... yeah turns out that 's not really true . 
  no , i 'm saying that :  scores ( of ) semi-naked drunken british tourists who fight in street and ** have sex on the beach ** . 
  would make me work shy . 
  i 'd be work shy too if brits came to my island and kept fucking up the place . 
  literally . 
  they should give her some eurobonds to stand on , then . 
   the reports of the asylum applications filed by turkish soldiers in germany came as chancellor angela merkel prepares to travel to turkey to meet president tayyip erdogan . 
  perfect timing . 
  the president of romania seems to be very tall .

  you must be really determined to get into heaven . 
  2016 brought an end to all jokes . 
  it 's about one of the biggest music festivals in austria . 
  that 's what we do in parliament between speeches : [ a thing ] ( http://tvthek.orf.at/profile/zib-spezial-angelobung-bundespraesident-alexander-van-der-bellen/13886544/zib-spezial-angelobung-bundespraesident-van-der-bellen/13904850/musikstueck-joseph-haydn-quartett-in-d-dur/13962743 ) ps : the eagle on the wall we call ` pleitegeier ' in vienna ( ~ flat broke vulture ) . 
  it 's on austrias coat of arms . 
   the term `` refugee '' was hijacked , it ** doesnt ** mean someone who escapes war or is a target of persecution . 
  yeah i misunderstood ` lease them under licence controls ' wrong . 
  would be crazy if you could n't launch them independently . 
  i do n't understand . 
  should n't the us pay the uk for the use of their submarines ( this ` lease ' thing seems backward ) ? 
  the way i read this is that the ultimate decision of firing these weapons rests with the us . 
  the uk gets to push the button only after they get it handed down from above . 
  your reasoning sounds good to me , i think you guys are doing amazing work in this sub . 
  defining ` good sources ' however is pretty tricky . 
  can ` good ' ones turn ` bad ' - how about ` bad ' into ` good ' ? 
  how to objectively judge media outlets from outside , to categorise them correctly ? 
  what metrics can be used for that ? 
  maybe relying on the subjective opinions of mods about what 's reliable and what is not , ai n't so bad . 
  with the right mod team you can surely last quite a while .
