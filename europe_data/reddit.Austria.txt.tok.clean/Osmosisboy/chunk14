  just remember that when you leave , only the rules you set in stone remain ... but we ca n't have a rule for everything anyway - this is only reddit and not a country - so hopefully the mods just keep on doing their thing and nothing ever changes . 
  my money is on ` definately ' as being the correct spelling in 25 years . 
  you watched the dude they just inaugurated , right ? 
  ... though maybe it 's just not funny . 
  sure i 'll send you a letter . 
  no biggie . 
  good luck to you too . 
  if you wa n't to know the official party line , where better to go to than ` state-approved propaganda ' ? 
  this just in : `` russia says ukraine is ` obsolete ' '', 
  you also need soldiers to man this equipment . 
  and schools to train those soldiers . 
  maintenance is also no joke . 
  in short : we must build additional pylons . 
  does anyone have a source in german , preferably from a reputable austrian media outlet ? 
  i looked but ca n't find anything . 
  edit : thanks / u/falkenhirn . 
  so they are saying they want to establish something that 's called ` arbeitsmarktpr\u00fcfung ' inside the whole eu , pertaining only to those branches of the job market with especially high unemployment rates . 
  this would then mean that those jobs would have to be filled with people already inland , and only if there is no one to be found the job is open for anyone as before . 
  at this point i 'm not so sure ` damaging information ' is something that applies to trump . 
  [ yeah , if top management could go to jail for unethical and illegal practices they helped to implement or facilitate , that 'd be great . 
  ] ( https://imgflip.com/s/meme/that-would-be-great.jpg ) ( i 'm not holding my breath though . ), 
  the dots make it look way cooler , get rekt germany . 
  the government of turkey should also make their own reddit , where everyone is free to praise erdogan as much as possible . 
  a paradise where no downvotes exist and everyone is of one mind . 
   what if what if what if is n't that one of the top reasons to even carry a gun - what if ? 
  i do n't find fault in weighing scenarios against each other to ascertain the risks involved . 
  the underlying issue was that the laws concerning guns might be changed ( that 's what the article is about ) so the argument that current laws are working and that at present everything is fine is beside the point . 
  i 'm concerned about things like the ` stand your ground rule ' , or whatever it 's called , in the us which has permitted people to walk free after killing someone because they ' * felt * threatened ' - i think that is over the line . 
  as long as the legal framework is solid and people carrying guns are well trained and stable individuals gun ownership is fine by me . 
  that 's '' ** mr. ** reddit shitposter '' to you , pal . 
  oh damn , i completely misread this then . 
  thanks for clearing it up for me . 
   in the letter to the germany portal , the ambassadors of lithuania , latvia and estonia noted that the baltic states did not join the soviet union voluntarily but were occupied and annexed , while the majority of western democracies , including germany , ** never recognized the soviet occupation of the baltic states ** , said the ministry . 
  huh , could this lead to germany recognizing it now ? 
  and how would russia receive this ? 
  i heard it in a video about two months ago . 
  here it is : [ -  video < - ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmy9uszm_j4 ) , the phrase i remembered is used [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/lmy9uszm_j4?t=149 ) . 
  but to be frank i do n't know why i even bothered searching for this , i feel like i just wasted time for nothing . 
  it was just a jokey comment and you 're just in defensive mode from the get go . 
  edit : oh , and next time when you call someone out maybe wait for more than seven minutes before attacking them further , i had to wade through months worth of videos to find it . 
  what i heard about him is that you want to be the * last * person talking to him before he has to make a decision . 
  [ you 're a soldier ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/4bwep_ffrwy?t=3 ), 
  okay . 
  can someone eli5 what 's going on , and how serious this is ? 
  i got to : '' ... policy makers took steps to unblock the piping of europe 's financial system by tackling an extreme shortage of the short-dated bonds that firms can use as collateral in repurchase agreements . 
  '' , before i had a mild stroke and quit reading . 
  what if there is an accident involving a truck swerving onto the sidewalk and hitting some people before stopping , then the driver gets out and someone shoots him because he suspects a terror attack ? 
  would n't you say this is a realistic scenario , more probable even than a terror attack ? 
  how common are truck accidents would you say ? 
  if someone shoots into a crowd it 's relatively easy to grasp the situation . 
  ( though i have to add that multiple people with guns on the scene would hinder the police a lot ) if a car just misses you by an instant it 's hard to say if someone just used it as a weapon . 
  i think that if you want the general public to defend itself from terrorist attacks , then getting a permit for a gun should involve a great deal of training . 
  weeks at the least , and retraining every couple of years . 
  do n't read too much into it . 
  i 'd say we mildly dislike ourselves too . 
  germany looks so tiny from up here !, 
  gagarin and korolev were truly amazing . 
  just fyi if you like to remember the ` space race ' there 's this really cool [ album ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy-kanvoy80 ) about it maybe it 's something you 'll like . 
  ( the whole album is called ` race for space ' from psb ), 
  i hear she has a heavy cold . 
  hope she gets better soon . 
  what could happen is the amount of speculation out there stays the same but authors may start to label it as such to avoid any problems . 
  that alone would be a huge gain because that would mean many dubious claims would no longer be brought forth as facts . 
  thank you , i did n't know [ that . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/excellency#government ), 
  apparently he also wrote a [ very nice letter ] ( http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/161223125620-donald-trump-putin-letter-exlarge-169.jpg ) to trump , addressed to ` his excellency donald trump ' . 
  numerous media outlets are reporting this or i 'd think it was fake . 
  source : http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/23/politics/trump-putin-christmas-letter-russian-relations/, 
  one approach could be to be a contact point people can go to if they read something outrageous and want an explanation with some concrete evidence behind it . 
  or maybe the staff is actively searching facebook , twitter and so forth for false claims and try to get into contact with the source immediately . 
  how do you know that what they claim is true and they are n't just scamming people ? 
   ~ spreading any further . 
  surely you mean ' ~ spreading any f\u00fchrer ' ? 
  actually ` shock therapy ' was meant as a set of measures to combat issues like hyperinflation and to generally bring countries out of deep economic troubles ( presumably the name comes from economies that are in ` shock ' and that you want to help ; not from your intended goal to shock someone ) . 
  source : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/shock_therapy_ ( economics ), 
  your quote is missing an 's ' . 
  or is it not showing up for you ? 
  nazi loch ness monster , is it you ? 
  really ? 
  [ -  link to article in austrian media about this months ago < - ] ( http://www.profil.at/wirtschaft/schwere-vorwuerfe-holzkonzern-schwaighofer-rumaenien-6268676 ), 
  how much to keep you quiet about this ? 
  finally we get something !, 
  i think we really earned a piece . 
  too soon for that kind of article ... 
  that vestager woman seems to be doing good work . 
  `` the initial answer is no . 
  if we do n't stick to the rules , the eurozone will fall apart , '' he [ sch\u00e4uble ] told die zeit , adding that the construction of the currency union had to be changed . 
  if hofer had won the presidential election last month it seems like this russia trip would have been his first international visit . 
  russia is heavily sanctioned , mind you , so him visiting there because `` austria needs international political and business contacts '' would have caused quite a stir , i think . 
  it just goes against the current consens in the eu about how to deal with putin and would have weakened the eu 's position on this . 
  there are those who are worried about the close ties some political parties seem to have to other countries they do n't `` manipulate the weak minded '' by reporting meetings such as this . 
  this is our slightly populist foreign minister at work . 
  i suspect food regulations in europe would be applied to imported food as well as domestically produced food . 
  china wants special regulations just for imported food . 
  huh . 
  i thought they were after this wto ` marked-economy ' status thing . 
  since christians are repressed in some countries , will this actually work and get them a higher chance of granted asylum ? 
  okay . 
  i guess i 'm too anal about this stuff .
