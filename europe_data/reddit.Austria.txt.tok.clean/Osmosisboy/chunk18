  it 's just that they themselves have this bit of info in the article :  seasonally and calendar adjusted gross domestic product was increased by 1.4 percent compared with the previous quarter . 
  which seems to call into question the context from which the headline stems - `` turkey 's economy grows 5 percent in first quarter of 2017 '' . 
  okay , compared to how many years ago ? 
  or maybe it is simply not seasonally adjusted then ? 
  it 's probably [ ` present arms ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/present_arms_\\ ( command \\ ) ) or something like that then . 
  you ca n't post something that looks so delicious and omit the recipe ... i think . 
  mods ? 
  is n't there a rule against this , it 's very cruel to me . 
  he is surprisingly well spoken for a man with a bucket on his head . 
  ps : his [ ` why vote for me ?

  no to both questions . 
  it 's just a picture i found mildly interesting so i brought it up , and i got ta say i am a bit perturbed by the way you just seem to assume things . 
  nice sign behind him . 
  on the flip side : [ geothermic map ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/eu/images/research/geothermal/map.jpg ) . 
  gib ( almost ) free [ energy ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/research/energy/eu/index_en.cfm?pg=research-geothermal ) pls . 
  what 's the lie here ? 
  i think your comparison to child pornography is a weak one . 
  is propaganda is easily accessible ( even via youtube ) and there are a lot of people who may just be curious about this , or like to watch military engagements . 
  i myself have watched a couple of is propaganda videos simply because i want to know how those people who threaten our way of life seek to portray themselves . 
  you 'd have to ban isis propaganda itself - which i think is impossible because you can not clearly define it . 
  they would just use other words to convey the same message , and so seek to remain within legal limits . 
  to stretch those legal limits to get to them would then go simply too far . 
  we should not allow the imprisonment of people based on what authorities think the message of a suspect is . 
  it will have to be very clear . 
  though i think having something like the is-flag should be punishable . 
  even if the flag has additional meanings not associated with the is , it has now become a symbol of it . 
  ( akin to the nazi flag ), 
  source would go well with a comment like this . 
  edit : i found this [ tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/louisa_compton/status/870920482303987713 ) from the editor of the bbc . 
  pretty ` meh ' , in my opinion . 
  must be a challenge to caricaturize a caricature and still remain somewhat subtle . 
  names are not important . 
  what truly matters is how big ` it ' is - and ` it ' is extremely large if you care to know . 
  tell a friend . 
  should n't it then be called arnold ? 
  what do you show when registering ? 
  my understanding is that the many smaller german speaking states ( including austria ) enjoyed a lot of independence throughout history and the formation of germany happened to not include austria - not included we were basically rivals , although ` friendly ' ones at that . 
   \u00d6sterreich historically was just an eastern realm of the germans i do n't know what you mean exactly . 
  edit : it occurs to me you may have been talking about ` german ' the language , there 's this [ wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_german ) which may be helpful . 
  basically we speak german with minor differences ( and call it ` austrian german ' ) , and have a lot of different german dialects across the country - just like in germany there are a lot of regional differences in dialect . 
  yeah , i think realizing this is really eye opening , and it makes me be much more skeptical of articles pertaining to internal affairs of non-english speaking countries . 
  i 'm not saying everything is false but it pays to be careful when reading such articles . 
   the policies are seen as an effort to avoid a collapse of the coalition government , which would trigger snap elections . 
  this shows that this outlet has no clue about austria at all - a snap election is already a sure thing in the first half of october . 
  party leaders have also already agreed on the date . 
  how dare they talk about our pleitegeier that way ... 
  should n't the maxim of maximizing profits mean that companies will try to get what they can anyway ? 
   `` this is supposed to last for eternity , '' said \u00c5smund asdal at the nordic genetic resource centre , which operates the seed vault . 
  there will be a lot of challenges to overcome then . 
  the [ ` criticism ' section ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mutual_assured_destruction#criticism ) of the wikipedia article to mad has a couple interesting points . 
  i think that this one challenge to the doctrine : `` no false positives ( errors ) in the equipment and/or procedures that must identify a launch by the other side . 
  '' , contrasted with how little time you have ( only minutes ) to start a retaliatory attack ( the ability to do this is an integral part of mad ) and what this means for real world scenarios can be a bit frightening . 
  but it 's true that we know how to avoid nuclear war - do not push the button , even if your equipment tells you that the other side already did it . 
  but i do n't think we have figured out a system that eliminates the role the unwillingness to ` actually do it ' plays as the ultimate safety net . 
  -- i mean look at this case from [ 1979 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_nuclear_close_calls#1970s ) , it reads like a movie script . 
  but unlike a movie it only lasted 7 minutes , that 's not a lot of time to have information running up and down the command chain and to make a decision . 
  or the false alarm on the soviet side in [ 1983 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanislav_petrov ) :  petrov was the duty officer at the command center for the oko nuclear early-warning system when the system reported that a missile had been launched from the united states , followed by up to five more . 
  petrov judged the reports to be a false alarm , [ 3 ] and his decision is credited with having prevented an erroneous retaliatory nuclear attack on the united states and its nato allies that could have resulted in large-scale nuclear war . 
  investigation later confirmed that the soviet satellite warning system had indeed malfunctioned . 
  [ 4 ] i 'm inclined to believe that the technology of today is less error prone , and the political climate less tense . 
  mad looks like a good idea now , but we will have to seriously reassess this if the time ever comes when some soldier actually follows procedure and does his job , while some part of equipment feeds false information to him . 
  then again i do n't think mad is something we have any control over , it 's more of where the circumstances of nuclear weapons have a kind of equilibrium which we have found out , and which allows us to not use them as long as certain conditions are met . 
  this is about a distasteful quote , not about who is responsible for her murder . 
  it was just a shitty thing to say considering what happened . 
  so how do i read this map ? 
  communist genes are red , right ? 
  what i 'm saying is that there are n't even german pilots who are trained to land/start from carriers . 
  so there is no possibility to use it as a base for their air operations - even if the italians provide all the sailors and naval support . 
  of course you could also ask for italian planes that can start/land on the carrier , and italian pilots who have the skills required to use those planes . 
  but at that point the italians do the whole job that germany set out to do . 
  are the bodyguards really untouchable on this ? 
  i ca n't quite believe they 'll get away with this , seems ludicrous . 
  i was unsure if it was a painting as well , if you zoom in and look in front of the palace then the people look a bit like they are painted . 
  same for the church in the far background once you zoom in on it . 
  i do n't mean it as criticism , just an observation . 
  i actually think it is a nice picture . 
   germany should just use italian carrier as a base in the east mediterranean and fk erdogan  ) . 
  germany has no way to operate off an aircraft carrier . 
  i do not think there are german planes who are suited for carrier operations , and there is basically no personnel trained for this . 
  but it would make me less scared . 
  those cyrillic letters look sharp and dangerous . 
  [ interesting ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mother%27s_day#dates_around_the_world ) , sweden seems to have a 2 week reprieve . 
  my ironometer has detected a lot of irony in your comment - could be what you wrote , could also be the youtube comment you quoted . 
  or both . 
  sometimes it 's nice to thank people for things you always take for granted . 
  in completely unrelated news - tomorrow is mother 's day . 
  it 's sad that so much time and effort is put into weapon manufacturing . 
  do n't get me wrong - i understand this is something we have to do . 
  no , no , no . 
  in 2020 when the usa elects its new president we will forget the last 4 years and this joke does n't work because that would make it 2016 again . 
  so ... it has come to this again , * italy * . 
  this is a truly insane way to represent data . 
  the countries are shrunk or blown up according to their tax rate - so you 'd have to possess a good knowledge about country sizes for this to be helpful in any way . 
  or maybe this is targeted to geography buffs who are studying economics ? 
  oh god , another election . 
  ^ ^ probably, 
  nice . 
  now put it in a box . 
  now please , with the arms outstretched and the palms pointing upward , slowly back away from the box .
