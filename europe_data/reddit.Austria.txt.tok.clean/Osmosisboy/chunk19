  what does he know , and when did he know it ? 
  those are the important questions . 
  no sane person would do it ` on a whim ' . 
  no , but i am childfree ^ ^ ^ tm at the moment . 
  i could n't say if i would * not ever * want to have children . 
   a syrian woman on board said she had traveled through six countries to reach libya , paying $ 1,000 in each and leaving two sons aged 12 and 13 behind in jordan . 
  `` i wanted to leave for europe , '' she said . 
  `` it was an attempt to get a better life and reunite my whole family in europe , but unfortunately we could n't make it . '', 
  edit : i can empathise . 
  but what are we ultimately supposed to do here ? 
  we ca n't take all of africa - i hope no one of note is arguing that we can . 
  what ?!, 
  see you in court . 
  also leave ireland with us - you 're not joined at the hip you know . 
  sounds like babi\u0161 should write you a check . 
  if someone knows ... - please let us know ? 
  i do n't think you will get away with no regulations at all . 
  in every sane legal system there would have to be a point where words go too far . 
  but you can debate about the point where laws should take effect for sure . 
  in short - yes , you have to go to court when you want comments removed , not just to facebook . 
  what happened was that a facebook account spread multiple reputation-damaging statements , against which the plaintiff went to court and got a preliminary injunction to stop this for now . 
  they then went with this injunction to facebook and said that they wanted those comments removed - but facebook only blocked the comments so they could n't be seen from inside austria . 
  the plaintiff now went to a higher court to effect the deletion of the comments worldwide . 
  this court ruled that facebook has to delete the disputed comments worldwide , and also that comments which contents are verbatim - so exactly the same , letter for letter - have to also be removed . 
  [ source , only in german \\ ( sorry \\ ) ] ( https://www.falter.at/archiv/falter_201705109505661b2c/muss%20facebook%20jetzt%20hasspostings%20l%c3%b6schen,%20frau%20windhager%3f ), 
  i think that if a facebook user comes across a comment attacking his reputation via false claims then there should be some way for the user to fight this effectively . 
  i agree that calling a politician ` corrupt ' is below the line where taking action would make sense or would even be practical - it 's just not enough . 
  definitely a shot , but not a done deal . 
  edit : just want to add that he would n't `` run '' for chancellor . 
  in austria we vote for political parties , which then appoint the chancellor - even if each party always makes it clear who they would want to appoint beforehand . 
  i 'm not a person that has intimate knowledge with laws but there are a couple of things i 'd like to add here . 
  ` hate speech ' is not a legal term in austria , and so i find it hard to believe that in a court ruling the term would even be used . 
  also from what i 've read in austrian newspapers this case is about slander , and the ability for a person to get slanderous comments removed by contacting facebook . 
  if facebook has a responsibility to delete ` hate speech ' on its own discretion is something that was n't covered in this verdict . 
  all that the court settled was the question whether the austrian court is able to rule on this ( it said it legally could ) and if blocking the contested comments only for austrian users is enough ( it is not , they have to delete it worldwide ) . 
  edit : fixed spelling mistake, 
  that the french really like fraternities , or something ? 
  those seem to be part of their national motto actually . 
  also they have their own nukes so it 's best not to make jokes that are too mean . 
  those laws now exist for many of the same reasons as decades ago - so that the most atrocious acts in the past do not get diluted and distorted . 
  those things really did happen , and we have a responsibility to hand an accurate account down the generations . 
  i think they are far from counter productive . 
  from a related [ article ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/17/google-lobbyists-congress-antitrust-brussels-eu ) :  google has employed several former eu officials as in-house lobbyists , and has funded european thinktanks and university research favourable to its position as part of its broader campaign . 
  this is something that ' worrying me . 
  eu officials who build friendships/connections and then go to work as a lobbyist after some years . 
  how vulnerable is the eu to special interests who employ this tactic ? 
  that seems to be pretty in line with the mid west [ polling station closing time ] ( http://www.270towin.com/imgs/closing_times.png ) though . 
  that would be a weird text on the ballot paper . 
  depends on your definition of nationalism . 
  if your definition includes that it is ` an extreme form of patriotism marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries ' ( or something in that vein ) , then you could easily conclude it 's inherently bad . 
   there have been intentional acts of genocide by mass starvation under capitalism i do n't mean to fight you on this , i 'm just curious - do you have some examples ? 
  what 's the most recent one you know ? 
  that video has some kind of vibe to it that i really dislike . 
  i ca n't nail it down succinctly but it 's a mix of an exhibited sense of self-righteousness , a certain lack of credibility to it all ( perceived by me ) and the blaming of the `` left '' intellectuals without naming instances of where they whitewash communist history in credible academia . 
  i think someone is pushing his agenda on to me and it just rubs me the wrong way . 
  stick it to the man , fellow austri - ... wait . 
  hmmm , maybe we 'll send one guy to test the water . 
  if it works out the rest can follow . 
  ah yes , i remember the days when the ussr wanted access to all my data in the cloud . 
  this is why anschluss can never happen ... 
  oh god , how deep will this reply chain go ? 
  please make it stop , it 's confusing my patriotic feelings . 
   this is unexpected ( unless i 'm just badly informed ) , and certainly not something that germany was driving for . 
  from the article :  german chancellor angela merkel had personally advocated to her colleague vucic to allow the memorial at jarek .

  * some emails are real, 
  thre 's a good bit of info in the ` criticism ' section of the vat wikipedia page - [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/value-added_tax#criticisms ) . 
  my understanding is that generally the status quo beats uncertainty for undecided voters .

  i can find no irony in this , only tragedy - how ironic . 
  the bbc should introduce next to their ` breaking news ' tag one for ` literal news ' . 
  you know , for when they strip words of their context , to make a headline . 
  it would work like this : `` literal news : english language ` losing importance ' - eu 's juncker '', 
  oh i misread that in your post , thank you for pointing this out . 
  so if parts of the government want to dissolve they need to win a vote in parliament ? 
  sounds to me like he just refuses to play the pm 's game . 
  if he wants to fire this minister he should do it directly . 
  and of course the president has the whole range of options given to him by the constitution , people should realize that if you want ` customs ' to endure in politics they need to be written into law . 
  you ca n't trust that the next president looks to the past presidents for guidance - something i very much hope austrians have realized , given the election we just had . 
  anyway , this is just my opinion and i honestly have to admit that i have very little knowledge about the situation . 
   people moving from africa to europe has always been a thing , even when it was up to the italian police to pick them up near italian coasts . 
  one of the points of contention is illustrated by [ this map ] ( https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/migrant-refugee-rescue-map.png?w=500&amp;h=392 ) ( [ i got it from this article ] ( http://time.com/refugee-rescue/ ) ) . 
  the smugglers use barely seaworthy rafts - which by itself make it just barely off the coast before needing rescue . 
  this increases the people those smugglers can service dramatically since they do not even need a boat that can make the journey to europe . 
  meanwhile the refugees who are in distress at sea , are picked up ( by ngo 's , and also the international rescue mission ) but * not * just brought ashore to the nearest port , but ferried all the way to italy . 
  this is what is rising the ire of many people , that the rescue mission is making the job very easy for smugglers and is therefore inflating the number of refugees . 
  this is why there is a call for refugee camps in , for example , libya - to bring the refugees rescued at see to the camps at the coast and decide their asylum request there . 
  and so take away the incentive to take to sea in rafts . 
  a 500 million increase in population ? 
  there must be a lot of unknowns in such a prediction . 
  i always find it weird that there are no confidence intervals circulated in tandem with such numbers . 
  -- i was curious and invested a bit of time reading [ this ] ( https://www.nap.edu/read/9828/chapter/4#4 ) , which apparently is out of a book concerned with population projections . 
  i found the following :  from 1958 onward , the error in u.n. projections of the world population to 2000 has averaged 2.8 percent . 
  errors in country projections have typically been substantially larger . 
  the greater accuracy of world projections over country projections stems in large part from the absence of migration error in world projections and the way other country errors cancel one another . 
  and  errors in population projections for individual countries are often substantially larger ( in percentage terms ) than errors for the world as a whole . 
  in some instances , errors of over 50 percent occurred in past forecasts for a number of countries . 
  those errors could of course go either way , and smaller countries were more error prone than larger ones .
