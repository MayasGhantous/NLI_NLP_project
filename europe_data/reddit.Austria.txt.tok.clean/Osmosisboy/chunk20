  also there is this [ graph ] ( https://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309069904/xhtml/images/p200036ecg43001.jpg ) which shows the relation of ` absolute error ' and ` projection length ' for different world regions . 
  you can see that the absolute error in projections for third world countries is often much larger than for the first world . 
  additionally i got the impression that a prediction for the next * 70 years * is not something that would be ordinarily done with any confidence - the longest projections they talked about in here was 30 years , and it is mentioned multiple times how dramatic the error increases with time . 
  nonetheless it is true that nigeria 's population is predicted to grow substantially in the future . 
  but i think impending climate change alone would make predictions on absurdly long timescales very error prone .

  you are right about the bunker , but i still think it is a stretch to call this ` hitler 's armchair ' because it implies the object has more significance than it has . 
  it 's just one of probably dozens or maybe hundreds of chairs found in the bunker . 
  does trump ` own ' the oval office ? 
  edit : when i replied to the comment it did n't entail the sentence : `` from hitlers bunker , its likely at one point that scumbag sat on it . '', 
  - it was just the link .

  that , for example , the idea that the eu is led along by corporations is n't one everyone ascribes too . 
  his other statements are equally controversial for some . 
  so he just strung concepts together that are n't necessarily accepted by everyone , without even attempting to explain . 
  and so i meant that if you are already on board with his opinions it may make perfect sense , but if you are not it reads like a couple of vague statements strung together not really expressing anything worthwhile . 
  so not that well said for me . 
  one of the ' [ recommendations ] ( http://urbanland.uli.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/05/619_reccomend.gif ) ' is ` positive media portrayal ' - so basically a call for propaganda . 
  what it * should * say is ` accurate media portrayal ' , that 's if the author himself actually subscribes to his own notion that migration is positive . 
  edit :  increased migration across europe has led to some relaxing of some planning regulations and increased responsiveness in planning processes and openness to new approaches , the study found , such as using containers as emergency housing ; repurposing land and buildings for medium-term provision ; greater reuse of brownfield sites and disused waterfronts ; i admit i may be clueless but this sounds like emerging ghettos to me .

  they would still sell ads , but at a reduced rate . 
  the possibility to target me with specific ads - which are more probable to peek my interest - enhances their value . 
  they are able to ask for increased rates on their ads , because they have data about me . 
  but it is all an ongoing discussion , and i think i see where you are coming from . 
  it clearly has some kind of value because they make money off it . 
  ` why ' is always a different question . 
  a pretty straightforward answer would be that because countries generally [ tax corporations ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporate_tax ) on their money earned inside of it , we are possibly able to extend this to include the profits they earn via digital means from people of this countries nationality . 
  now why should we tax corporations in the first place ? 
  one part of the answer is that the country , where the profit is generated , provides part of the infrastructure that is used in generating the profit . 
  even the labour used by the corporation is often something that only exists in this country because of public investments into some form of school system . 
  so this is part of how taxes are justified . 
  i 'm not an expert in this kind of stuff though , so take it with a grain of salt . 
  edit : so in the case of generating money out of peoples data : since they generate profit out of something that ` belongs ' to the country ( e.g. 
  its citizens data ) , they should pay tax on it - or so the justification might look like . 
  i assume this is part of their debate . 
  i do n't know how . 
  they already seek to maximize profits - they will do whatever they get away with , if we tax them or not . 
  nice , i think this will work out .

  i 'm not arguing on the side of communism or the ussr . 
  all i wanted to illustrate was that perception is not a trivial thing . 
  the headline :  austrian president calls on all women to wear headscarves in solidarity with muslims to fight ` rampant islamophobia ' is blatant misinformation . 
  he spoke about the ** possibility ** to petition woman ** in the future ** to wear them - as a rhetoric device to indicate how bad islamophobia in austria might get . 
  * he did not call on woman to do anything at this time . 
  * i must say i 'm quite angry about this lapse in journalistic integrity from the ` independent ' . 
  well , here is my translation of what he said , feel free to mention possible translation errors . 
   it is the right of woman ... [ asks himself : do men also wear headscarfs ? 
  ] ... it is the right of woman to dress however they want ; that is my opinion on this ... - by the way , not only muslim woman , but every woman can wear a headscarf . 
  and the way this is going - and here i arrive at the next question , the one about the factual islamophobia which is making the rounds and could culminate in a day where we petition all woman to wear a headscarf - all - out of solidarity to those who do because of religious reasons .

  his answer is at ~ 2:48 . 
  or maybe it could have changed itself , so as to be of more benefit to its inhabitants and so therefore being perceived by them as a ` good thing ' . 
  i do n't think simply lying is enough to avert a negative public perception in the long run - at least not until we get into dystopia territory . 
  ah yes , the greatest philosophers of the past found that one a tough nut to crack . 
  but being perceived as a good thing by more people could have prevented the fall of the soviet union . 
  there 's been so much ` breaking news ' recently , it must be completely broke already . 
  oh , i think it would be possible to find some deniers .

  how many billions has it been awarded ? 
  i dislike the term ` alternative facts ' a lot . 
  i wish people would use ` misinformation ' or ` lie ' , or something in that vein . 
  i 'm not appalled by the general sentiment he is trying to convey , but at the way he says it . 
  it 's easy to interpret lots of things into his statement , or make a sound bite of it sound bad ( which it really does ) , which is an error in rhetoric unworthy of a seasoned politician . 
  i also wish the headscarf debate would be more grounded in reality . 
  how many austrians think a headscarf is a symbol of subjugation ? 
  how many of those wearing it out of religious reasons feel pressure to wear it from their peers or religious institutions , and so feel compelled to wear it ? 
  maybe we could establish if it is , in an overwhelming majority of cases , ` just an attire ' worn out of each woman 's own volition .
