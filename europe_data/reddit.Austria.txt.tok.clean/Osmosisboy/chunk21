  or if it * is * indeed often a sign of oppression . 
  banning some part of clothing out of ` gut feeling ' is something i ca n't get behind . 
  from where i 'm standing what you are saying is hyperbole . 
  i would acknowledge that the eu is an incomplete project , and not without faults . 
  they make it sound like we could retaliate in a court of law if they do it now . 
   the joint venture , known as ellalink , is also meant to bypass us surveillance . 
  it will be subject to brazilian and european privacy protection laws , which are much stricter than us legislation . 
  austria has an infantry fighting vehicle ( [ looks like this ] ( http://www.army.cz/assets/informacni-servis/zpravodajstvi/ascod---ulan_3.jpg ) ) named ` ulan ' which was the name of a type of cavalry unit that [ originated from hussars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/uhlan ) . 
  edit : clarified a bit . 
  why do you feel the need to insert the word ` hijab ' into the quote ? 
  he does n't say it . 
  context : open discussion of van der bellen with the audience . 
  the questions are sadly not part of the video clip . 
  ( and i do n't know them . ), 
  this is what van der bellen says :  it is the right of woman ... [ asks himself : do men also wear headscarfs ? 
  ] ... it is the right of woman to dress however they want ; that is my opinion on this ... - by the way , not only muslim woman , but every woman can wear a headscarf . 
  and the way this is going - and here i arrive at the next question , the one about the factual islamophobia which is making the rounds and could culminate in a day where we petition all woman to wear a headscarf - all - out of solidarity to those who do because of religious reasons . 
  yeah , that 's what he meant . 
  but the way he says it is appalling . 
  disappointing to see this from a seasoned politician . 
   china was excluded from the international space station mainly due to us legislation barring such cooperation and concerns over the chinese space programme 's strong military connections . 
  how strong is the argument for denying the chinese cooperation ? 
  i would be interested if someone has an analysis of the situation . 
  my understanding is he does n't actually want to have any lists , or act in any concrete way - an austrian politician through and through . 
   in a recent poll asking when was the best time to inform children of the facts of life , 9 out of 10 austrians said they should be kept in the dark . 
  lol, 
   used to have access to the sea right through the heart =(, 
  & nbsp ; but ^ the ^ ^ strategic ^ ^ ^ location ^ ^ ^ ^ / s ? 
  but we 're neutral . 
  shit , you actually fooled me for a bit ... 
  no ... we are south of them . 
  you sure about that australia thing ? 
  you 've done it now you scoundrel , i 'll write your name onto the list . 
  haha sure , just drink one for [ mundl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmm4whotbgc ) . 
  this is how you get to ww1 though . 
  i guess you have to see it from the inside . 
  politics here definitely has more of a ` teenage ' vibe . 
  are n't we kinda allied now ? 
  we should merge our countries to make the flag problem disappear . 
  let 's go austro-latvian empire !, 
   asked if he would refute claims that russia is providing weapons to the taliban , nicholson answered definitively . 
  `` oh no , i 'm not refuting that , '' the general said . 
  is n't this line of questioning a bit backwards ? 
  but i ca n't get enough of ` earth apples ' . 
   `` it is not crazy , '' insists gernot alfons , head of the evn thermal waste plant . 
  could be he wants his support announcement to generate headlines closer to the second round for more exposure . 
  could be a lot of other things too , of course . 
  i hear he was n't so great either , but rather short . 
  the contracts for workers are mostly negotiated by the unions , of course they contain how many hours you work per week , how many hours are permitted on one workday and stuff like that . 
  the industry just is n't willing to deliver what the unions want to see for them to back sunday as a work day . 
  having a weekend is a big part of life in austria - one we chose to protect . 
  i would not want to give it up easily . 
  it is banned in austria because the industry , which is very much in favour of opening sundays , ca n't agree with the trade union on how to exactly implement this - which makes the government reluctant to change anything concerning sunday openings . 
  one issue is that while the industry claims this will generate jobs , the union does n't believe them and thinks that what will happen is that the hours of already employed workers will get longer with not enough financial compensation for this to be desirable for them . 
  edit : added a comma, 
  i think the word ` pogrom ' is used incorrectly here . 
  hah , i did n't take any offence , no worries . 
  ^ ^ to be completely honest my reply seems in retrospect a bit like arguing semantics anyway . 
  cheers !, 
  yeah , political parties apparently find it hard to be critical of immigration without also appearing ( or often actually being ) spiteful towards immigrants . 
  i think the main problem is the amount of resources ( mainly manpower ) a truly comprehensive immigration program would need . 
  that 's just journalists opining about isil strategy . 
  i mean it is very interesting , but i still doubt that somewhere in northern iraq their leadership is discussing how to make france elect le pen . 
  they polarize , but i do n't think they have goals which are so specific as to which politician is elected . 
   ( ... ) isis 's goal is to ensure she wins ( ... ) you ca n't simply say that and not back it up with some reasoning . 
  this is n't an established fact . 
  give me your social media passwords so i can confirm . 
  what is the matter with nh90s ? 
  ( total noob question ), 
  should n't they hold italy 's wine ? 
  i mean supposedly france has good taste ? 
  what do you mean * they ca n't * ? 
  great place for sailing . 
  i love all the different islands , some with old ruins on them . 
  they do n't like to finish their houses though . 
  ( i heard because of tax reasons ? ), 
  you can check-out any time you like , but you can never leave, 
  the article is barely an ` article ' . 
  it 's very short and lacks information , also there is this part :  back in february 2016 , salehi said iran and hungary had discussed plans to design and develop a small nuclear reactor for hungary . 
  ** the aeoi will `` design and develop a 25-megawatt reactor for hungary , '' ** salehi told reporters after meeting his hungarian counterpart in budapest . 
  the project `` requires a lot of scientific work to come up with such a design , certainly a number of years of hard work . 
  ** we want to see if we can do this ** , '' he further said . 
  which is mixed into the information that hungary and iran signed a memorandum about cooperation , making it sound as if iran building a reactor for hungary is now a done deal . 
  but i do n't think this is the case and that there are just talks for now . 
  in any case it sounds weird . 
  why would hungary want to buy a reactor from iran , when they are apparently not sure they can actually build one ? 
  oh and the article is on ` http://www.tehrantimes.com' , so scepticism is called for . 
  edit : made a sentence clearer, 
  have you looked into the work the us congress and senate have done in the past decade ? 
  it all looks pretty grim to me . 
  i like the colours . 
  there seems to be no grass at all , curious . 
  sounds grim . 
  i hope vestager is on the case . 
  murica - ` rubs eyes ' - murcia ... right that makes more sense . 
  very cool . 
  what made you decide on the bull for the flag ? 
  i just think it 's a well made video . 
  actually i do n't agree with many of her viewpoints/solutions . 
  i think that 's a really good campaign video .
