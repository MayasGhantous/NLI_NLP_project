  or the name of the room ? 
  2017 , people . 
  in your post you write :  the international criminal court has been accused of bias and as being a tool of western imperialism , only punishing leaders from small , weak states while ignoring crimes committed by richer and more powerful states like the usa , china , russia and france . 
  if you go to [ this link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/states_parties_to_the_rome_statute_of_the_international_criminal_court ) , and look on the map in the top right you see the countries which are legally obligated to cooperate with the icc in the colours green and yellow . 
  so the usa , china and russia ( among others ) do not cooperate with the icc which makes bringing a successful case against one of their citizens nearly impossible . 
  the argument about a targeted africa i find rather poor , because it does not establish how a ruling in africa would disadvantage african countries . 
  does the icc not promote justice and security in africa ? 
  the cases against those african leaders were ( as far as i know ) fair trials and those people did commit those crimes . 
  so if you do not criticise the proceedings of the court and perhaps acknowledge that they do good work , would n't you * want * them to do as much as possible in your vicinity ? 
  i assume you 've already seen this but in case you have not , this is what the icc has to say about those allegations : ( [ source , go to page 11 of the pdf ] ( https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/pids/publications/uicceng.pdf ) )  ** there are allegations that the icc is only targeting african countries . 
  is that true ? 
  the icc is concerned with countries that have accepted the court 's jurisdiction and these are in all continents . 
  african countries made great contributions to the establishment of the court and influenced the decision to have an independent office of the prosecutor . 
  in 1997 , the southern african development community ( sadc ) was very active in supporting the proposed court and its declaration on the matter was endorsed in february 1998 , by the participants of the african conference meeting in dakar , senegal , through the `` declaration on the establishment of the international criminal court '' . 
  at the rome conference itself , the most meaningful declarations about the court were made by africans . 
  without african support the rome statute ( note : this brought the icc into existence ) might never have been adopted . 
  in fact , africa is the most heavily represented region in the court 's membership . 
  the trust and support comes not only from the governments , but also from civil society organisations . 
  the court has also benefited from the professional experience of africans and a number of africans occupy high-level positions in all organs of the court . 
  the majority of icc investigations were opened at the request of or after consultation with african governments . 
  other investigations were opened following a referral by the united nations security council , where african governments are also represented . 
  finally , in addition to its formal investigations , the court 's office of the prosecutor is conducting preliminary examinations in a number of countries across four continents . 
  all the knowledge gathered here is from ~ 20 minutes research on the internet so it might well be i 've missed some obvious things . 
  but from where i 'm standing it looks like the people of africa should want the icc to continue with its work - but ultimately each country has to choose for itself . 
  if i were a citizen of an african nation i would however be sceptical if my government decides to withdraw from the icc - especially if politicians from my country are currently investigated by them , or have a high chance of being charged in the future . 
  they are not simply receiving a sack of money though . 
  [ the eu is involved ] ( http://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/funding-grants_en ) in choosing the projects that get funds . 
  very entertaining read , thanks for that . 
  the yugoslav wars happened when i was a small child so i never really lived in a world where yugoslavia existed , or even truly realized that there once was a big south-eastern neighbour . 
  i mean i * heard * about it and saw it on a map but it never sunk in how different europe could look today , and how little time has actually passed since yugoslavia was a thing . 
  `` politburo took potato , only sadness '' =  `` eu give potato , only potato '' ? 
  yeah , that would be my concern as well . 
  the misconduct mentioned in the article happened in belgium , so it might well be that the slaughterhouses in the netherlands are already keeping high standards . 
  ( i do n't know this though ) in any case being always watched by cameras would n't be a work environment i would enjoy .

   he ( note : the finance minister ) estimates that the state would need to hire some ** 35,000 tax advisors ** , who will be paid some ron 10,000 ( eur 2,200 ) per month . 
  thus , the state will spend almost ** eur 1 billion per year ** to implement this new taxation system . 
  are there even that many qualified tax advisers available ? 
  it also would be interesting to know what the state hopes to achieve with this - more tax revenue ? 
  more ` fairness ' in taxation ? 
  what does the finance minister estimate the bottom line will look like - budget wise , i mean . 
  sadly the article is a bit lacking . 
  some of them stare back at me ... wait ... norway - are you mocking me ? 
  maybe provide more background - i have no idea what this is about or who ` you ' is in this context . 
  ( edit : tl/dr the austrian constitutional court will rule on whether the election is void . 
  possibly triggering a repeat of the election . ), 
  since the election has garnered an unusual amount of international media attention ( crazy for austrian standards ) last month and there are significant developments i thought i 'd give you a heads up . 
  oh , also i have n't read this online anywhere so it 's great to know no one * really * cares what happens in austria . 
  last month was just a fluke  . 
  ( when searching just now i did indeed find some articles about this , but i guess they just did n't make the rounds ) where we left off : vdb ( green party , left wing candidate ) narrowly beat hofer ( fp\u00d6 , right wing candidate ) by ~ 30000 votes ( 50.35 % to 49.65 % ) in an election where the main parties candidates were eliminated earlier ( probably because voter dissatisfaction with the government ) and only more `` extreme '' candidates remained for the run-off ballot . 
  what happened since : the results have been contested by hofer 's party ( fp\u00d6 ) . 
  the constitutional court ( which will rule on this ) has already heard some 90 witnesses and the evidence garnering part of the hearing is practically over . 
  in the next weeks we will probably have their ruling . 
  ( edit : there 's a good chance they will ** void ** the election , requiring a repeat election . ), 
  this contention is all about the postal vote , which has drastically risen in popularity and thus in numbers in the last ~ 10 years and has also seen a some new laws ( dealing with when/how to open and count them ) not that long ago ( ~ 2 years past ) . 
  the fp\u00d6 says these laws have been widely broken by election officials e.g. 
  they were counted too early ; they were not opened in front of witnesses , as is required and stuff like that . 
  traditionally the fp\u00d6 has been a bit weak with postal voters ( as they were in this election , the postal vote changed the outcome ) , probably because more highly educated people use it and they are not part of the typical fp\u00d6 demographic . 
  the fp\u00d6 has said numerous times they want to change how postal votes work because they think this is `` strange '' . 
  they say that manipulation of the election ** could have happened ** even as they themselves have no evidence that it has . 
  indeed many fp\u00d6 appointed election-witnesses have said in front of the judges that they do not think anything was manipulated . 
  now , by the letter of the law the constitutional court has to declare the election void if ** laws were broken and this has led to a manipulated vote count ** - so they should have to proof that there was indeed manipulation and as far as i have heard there is only proof of a general sloppiness in following the laws . 
  but in the past the court has ruled more in the sense that if manipulation ** would ** have been possible , that is already enough . 
  it is however fair to say there has never been a case regarding elections that thoroughly reviewed . 
  so that 's roughly where we stand now , next week the attorneys of both sides will have their say and comment on the witnesses statements and in a couple of weeks we will ( probably ) have a ruling . 
  i think the general perception is that it is appalling how lax our voting officials ( some of them even belonging to the fp\u00d6 ) were with their duties and how the new laws for postal votes were apparently not workable in practice ( many officials claimed they did n't have the manpower/time to follow the law closely ) and my personal opinion is that however the court will decide this will further boost the strength of the fp\u00d6 , as they are experts in exploiting this kind of stuff . 
  source : some of it can be found on wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_presidential_election,_2016#results ) i tried to be fair and keep an open mind . 
  i did , however vote for vdb and i do not like the fp\u00d6 ( i think they are a purely populist party , interested primarily in strife - and so poisoning the political climate . 
  i do n't like their policies nor how they conduct themselves ) , so this can easily colour my perception of events . 
  maybe some of you have a well formed opinion on ceta ? 
  maybe others do n't . 
  this is my attempt at forming one . 
  the media in austria covers ceta mostly by repeating the talking points from other people . 
  so you might read about union speakers being against it because of such-and-such ( e.g. 
  `` worker protection will be lowered '' ) , and industry officials calling it a good thing because of so-and-so ( e.g. 
  `` economy will grow '' ) . 
  there 's also the contentious issue of the arbitration court - or isds i think they call it now , which will provide corporations with another way to handle disagreements with governments . 
  isds is a very contentious issue in austria , and is almost always brought up by ceta-opponents . 
  what i have n't seen is an article that tries to be objective and is able to stand on its own , without quoting what others have said . 
  just a summary of the key points in ceta coupled with a succinct and competent analysis , an analysis which is free to admit when the effect of something written in ceta is hard to quantify and ca n't honestly be evaluated at this time . 
  ( this is n't that article , i 'm not a journalist ) i followed the public discussion somewhat and know roughly what ceta is about , but since most of what i read are just quotes from either pro- or anti-ceta guys taken from interviews i ca n't really form my own opinion - for that i would need not only information but also context to that information `` who says what , why ? '' . 
  so i strolled around the internet and plucked some of my own information , this is where i went and what i took with me : first i searched on reddit - maybe someone already made a summary of all i was looking for ( including sources ) - sadly i did not find what i was looking for . 
  after that i looked at [ `` questions and answers '' referring to ceta on an official eu homepage ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/ceta/questions-and-answers/ ) keeping in mind that those are the guys who obviously would try to make it look good , but i doubt they would outright lie about something . 
  things i took with me :  canada is the eu 's 12th most important trading partner . 
  the eu is canada 's second biggest trading partner after the us and accounts for nearly 10 % of its external trade . 
   investment is also a key part of eu-canada trade relations . 
  the eu is the second largest foreign investor in canada and canada the fourth largest foreign investor in the eu . 
  those are quotes from the q/a . 
  so it seems like from the eu standpoint the investment portions of ceta * should * [ * ] be much more important than the trade portions . 
  they also have long explanations on why investment dispute settlement is important and how they want to make it `` safe '' so that governments can still shape their policies after their own will , which sounds okayish , but honestly i do n't get it . 
  why not just create an international trade and investment court operating mostly the same as existing court systems ? 
  is n't this isds thing already halfway there ? 
  at the bottom of the last q/a point is a link [ `` more information about the investment dispute settlement and ceta '' ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2016/february/tradoc_154329.pdf ) ... this 1598 page document , written in legalese is useless to me . 
  i also found this [ ceta impact assessment ] ( http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2011/september/tradoc_148201.pdf ) which has a neat summary starting on page 14 . 
  i read parts of that summary and found this interesting :  the ceta is expected to lead to overall gains in welfare , real gdp , total exports , the balance of trade and wages in both canada and the eu over the long-term . 
  based on modelling results , these gains will be maximised under an agreement that offers the highest degree of liberalisation . 
  specifically , the modelling estimates that the eu will experience increases in its real gdp of 0.02 % to 0.03 % over the long-term , while canada is estimated to see increases ranging from 0.18 % to 0.36 % . 
  i could n't find the definition of `` long-term '' anywhere in that document , maybe there 's some wide accepted definition i do n't know , but i imagine this means something like 10 years . 
  0.02 % to 0.03 % seems so close to zero , how would you even measure this after a `` long-term '' to determine success ?
