  i thought so too , but since '' [ individuate ] ( https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/individuate ) '' turned out to be a real word i thought i 'd ask . 
  that the pro-eu factions want to turn us into the `` united states of europe '' and that we will come to resemble the usa in some way is a ( minor ) talking point of the right wing as they seek to steer us in a ` europskeptic ' , or ` anti-federalization ' direction . 
  it 's definitely not meant as something positive . 
  thinking about it i would say the ` silicon valley ' and its huge businesses are sometimes brought up as something that 's worth emulating . 
  specifically when they talk about business reforms and ` overbearing ' regulations . 
  what constitutes an ` individuated society ' ? 
  some people are willing to go into debt for a nice car , because it is important to them . 
  the same holds true for clothing . 
  depends on the reasons for uk 's supposed success , if those things can be replicated by other potential quitters then , sure , there might be others opting to leave the eu . 
  there 's no replacing the us for now , but i would anticipate growing chinese influence . 
  also a lot of friction in asia as china tries to find out what they can get away with . 
  the thing is , as i understand it , china 's ruling party is very committed to continuing economic growth - it 's what the populace wants and expects . 
  so they need the global economy as much as the global economy needs china . 
  maybe we all grow even more dependant on each other and major wars will continue to be ` just not worth it ' . 
  we 'll find enough things to fuck each other over for , for sure , but maybe it wo n't be so bad . 
  that 's what they write onto their shirts though , and they seem like honest folk . 
  edit : grammar, 
  the veto powers coupled with the ` permanent members ' thing make a farce out of it anyway . 
  it 's more like a glorified forum for people to make statements that are supposed to mean something , and to have something to throw at humanitarian crisis . 
  a 5.4 billion $ budget also is n't all that much all things considered . 
  i 'd say make it the primary task of the un to combat humanitarian crisis and come up with a more sensible approach for voting on matters ( like intervening to stop genocide ) , maybe grant veto power over matters to every affected country in the vicinity . 
  never gon na happen though . 
   did fico ( slovakia pm ) agreed to host illegal migrants for eu quotas ? 
  the eu quotas concern all migrants , and so will include people that will later be deemed illegal migrants as well as legit refugees who will get asylum . 
  this is a minor thing , but i want to point out that technically * no one * agreed to host * illegal * migrants . 
  anyway , i think i understand what you mean . 
  as far as i can tell , the situation is that at the end of 2015 slovakia ( and others ) were [ overruled in a majority vote ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34329825 ) during a meeting of the council of the european union concerning migrant quotas . 
  slovakia and hungary have then gone on to [ challenge this ] ( https://euobserver.com/migration/137857 ) in the european court of justice , which will make a preliminary statement on 26.07.2017 and a final ruling probably at the end of the year . 
  i have n't heard about the pm directly agreeing to host refugees , but i can tell you that austria is also not on track to meet the quotas and we are also not currently under threat of eu sanction . 
  maybe the eu commission believes there 's still constructive talking going on with us , it 's hard to tell . 
  i also found this relevant quote ( [ source ] ( http://abcnews.go.com/international/wirestory/eu-chief-states-sanctioned-refugees-48025035 ) ) :  on tuesday [ clarification : 13.06.2017 ] , the eu 's top migration official , dimitris avramopoulos , praised austria and slovakia for recently pledging to do more . 
  but as of june 9 , austria had still not relocated a single refugee . 
  i found a similar quote in the austrian press agency so it seems credible . 
  ** so in conclusion it seems clear to me that austria and slovakia did make some form of conciliatory statements toward the eu commission , but to what degree the pm of slovakia was personally involved is not clear at this point ** . 
  ( it could for example simply have been another minister who made some kind of pledge , technically this migrant quota is legally binding to slovakia and so someone in ` middle management ' may have simply felt compelled to follow through with it , and communicated this to the eu commission which then appeased them ) edit : added the date in the quote for clarification . 
  how much shit does a hufflepuff fan get ? 
  a friend of mine once mentioned he liked them the most and holy shit that discussion got almost out of hand . 
  maybe my absolute favourite : * [ zogg from betelgeuse ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/zoggfrombetelgeuse/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0&amp;sort=p ) explainins certain concepts that play a big role for humans , e.g. 
  language , rituals , aesthetics , mathematics and so on . 
  the premise is that you are watching a guide made for aliens who might want to visit earth ( or maybe conquer it ) . 
  sadly after a dozen or so videos the creator stopped making them , still every now and then i come back and watch episodes because i like them so much . 
  give [ episode 1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xftmkilu6xg ) a shot you are an alien preparing for his first visit on earth . 
  make sure your paperwork with the galactic bureaucracy is in order though . 
  others i frequently to semi-frequently watch : * [ cgp grey ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/cgpgrey/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid ) - shortish videos , each dealing with a distinct topic ranging from geography to lord of the rings . 
  * [ corridor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/corridordigital/videos?view=0&amp;flow=grid&amp;sort=p ) - well made , vfx heavy videos , meant to entertain and tell a short story * [ worth a buy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/worthabuyguys/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid ) - pc game reviewer , tells it pretty straight how he feels about a game * [ shut up & sit down ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucyrhigdukdiow07pd8phxcw/videos?sort=p&amp;view=0&amp;flow=grid ) - boardgame reviews , can be pretty entertaining * [ motorcyclist magazine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/motorcyclistmag/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0&amp;sort=p ) - motorcycle related stuff , i mostly watch the ~ 10minute ` adventure videos ' when they travel somewhere * [ lindybeige ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/lindybeige/videos?flow=grid&amp;sort=p&amp;view=0 ) - mostly history ( often war history medieval -  ww2 ) stuff , some other interesting bits strewn between edit : special mention for [ bill wurtz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/billwurtz/videos?sort=p&amp;view=0&amp;flow=grid ) 's channel . 
  the two long videos are amazing . 
  maybe the [ most awesome stuff ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mh5ly4mz15o ) i 've ever watched on youtube . 
  the rest of the videos are very wurtz . 
  make it a priority when deciding who to vote for . 
  communicate to others why it is important to you and why it should be important to them as well . 
  our previous currency , the ` schilling ' , also did not have a nickname in wider use . 
  at least not that i 'm aware of . 
  the colloquialisms we used had more to do with ` geld ' ( = ` money ' ) , things like ` kohle ' ( literal translation : ` coal ) , ` zaster ' ( literal translation : i have no clue ) and ` moneten ' ( ehhh , also no clue ) spring to mind . 
  those are all in current use for the euro . 
   ( ... ) could the process that elects your party be improved ( ... ) your phrasing sounds a bit weird to me , i suppose you mean ` could the process by which a government gets determined be improved ' . 
  keep in mind that the head of state in a parliamentary system is not part of the government , so there is a different process for electing that person and there may be a bit of a disconnect between the day to day business of politics and the role the head of state plays in such a system . 
  my only major gripe in austria is that snap elections should n't be used simply at an opportune time when polls indicate you got a shot at making some gains in parliament , but how you 'd prevent abuse there i do n't know . 
  it 's probably more a question of goodwill than something that can be remedied by changing the election system . 
  i want the parties that form the government to work for the full term , and i want them to know they have to work together or they have nothing to show for when the next election comes up . 
  just calling it quits in the middle of the term and accusing the respective ` other ' party of being at fault and obstructionist is infuriating to me . 
  i hope that parties who announce snap elections continue to get punished in elections so as to dissuade others in the future and make it clear that we voters want them to work , and be more considerate * at the beginning of the term * when they choose with whom they form a government . 
  edit : thinking a bit more about it i think i 'd prefer a switch to one of the ` alternative vote ' systems . 
  i really hate that i also have to keep possible majorities for government in mind and ca n't simply vote for the party i like most . 
  ( even if so far that has n't made much of a difference ), 
  the way our bureaucracy is structured there are high public servants called `` amtsrat '' and `` inspektor '' , those people head small to medium sized departments ( e.g. 
  municipal authorities , forest departments ... ) in the bureaucracy . 
  in my experience they get a lot of respect , especially when they are stationed in smallish local communities . 
  yeah , trump is featured frequently . 
  not non stop but every couple of days something crops up that i notice . 
  migration is still a hot topic , every time they rescue one of the big refugee boats in the mediterranean with at least a couple hundred people it gets mentioned , and there is a plethora of opinion pieces about this topic - admittedly it has somewhat abated by now and only gets headlines if the eu makes a new decision or there is an international summit . 
  other than that we have elections coming up in fall so various politicians talk shit to each other through the media . 
  count us out then too . 
  at least in austria , the lower house is more powerful . 
  i do n't know in which countries the upper house holds more power than the lower house . 
  a quick search brought up australia but i do n't know how powerful their senate really is . 
  does that mean that elections for senators are considered enormously important in the usa , and come with a lot of media attention ? 
  do seats in the senate switch frequently or are they mostly considered ` safe ' ? 
  i would be curious to know whether you are aware that about half the world 's national legislatures are bicameral and that many countries , like austria for example , consider themselves democracies in spite of using such a bicameral system . 
  if austrian 's call their country a democracy does this then mash with your understanding of what a democracy is ? 
  would you call austria , or many of the other ` bicameral system users ' , democracies ? 
  that you were purposely using your personal definitions , while aware that they are n't shared by others was n't clear to me . 
  you also seem to not include ` representative democracies ' into your personal definition of ` democracy ' which makes communication tricky , and goes against commonly accepted convention which is where all the replies to your comment come from . 
  having to argue semantics distracts from the original topic and conflates arguments in a way that needlessly complicates discussions . 
  honestly it 's annoying to me , and i 'm a bit frustrated about it but just to be clear , i do n't mean to insult you or anything like that . 
  a [ federal republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_republic ) is a form of [ representative \\ ( or indirect \\ ) democracy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/representative_democracy ) , this is the way we use the word ` democracy ' today and its definition encompasses the usa . 
  when the us constitution got written the term ` democracy ' was primarily linked to * direct * democracy - * this * was what the political elite of the time was very opposed to , and so they were careful to not call the usa a democracy . 
  it 's perfectly fine to call them a democracy now though , since our definition has expanded to include indirect democracies . 
  around 2008 or so , shortly after the financial crisis , a large percentage of an austrian bank which was in bad shape ( hypo alpe adria ) got sold to a german state ( bavaria ) . 
  some time later it came to light that there was no saving this bank and the german state felt deceived or something like that , also one of the austrian states ( carinthia ) owed the bank around 20 billion euros , which was enough money to ruin carinthia if those debts would be called upon by the bank - which looked like a real possibility . 
  ( coincidentally this also brought into the public eye what the ` right wing ' fp\u00d6 had done to carinthia 's finances , which were in dire straits . 
  carinthia was traditionally governed by them and was a strong voter base for them . 
  phrases like `` they ruined carinthias future . '', 
  accompanied with a lot of blame got thrown around at the time . ), 
  so this was a fucking disaster , we apparently had to buy the bank back from bavaria and throw an ungodly amount of money at it to keep it afloat . 
  even worse the ~ 2 billion it had gotten from the state by 2013 still was n't nearly enough so the decision was made to split it up into 2 parts . 
  the ` good part ' which could survive on its own and the ` bad part ' which could not and was nationalized . 
  now , all the creditors who were still owed money by this ` bad part ' sued to get their money back from the new owner : the austrian tax payer . 
  last year our finance minister gave in and coughed up 12.5 billion for them . 
  it 's a disaster and every politician involved in the major decisions which led to this should be ostracised if you ask me . 
  of course they are not , they quietly slipped away out of the limelight and have some cushy job somewhere behind the scenes .
