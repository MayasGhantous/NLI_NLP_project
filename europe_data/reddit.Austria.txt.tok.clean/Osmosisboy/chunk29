  if this is what happened why has practically no one faced charges ? 
  the blame for the crash would fall on the private sector , but the public institutions ( and with this the eu ) would be to blame for the failure of identifying and punishing those persons responsible , to set an example and prevent similar behaviour in the future . 
  and also to serve justice . 
  ( eu values anyone ? ), 
  the second one ( which is antithetic to the first ) is that * no illegal * activities actually took place . 
  this would mean there was not sufficient regulation to prevent the crisis at the time , which would be a failure of public institutions . 
  the eu can say that the crisis really originated in the usa and that they could not be expected to regulate usa financial markets . 
  fair enough . 
  but where is the regulation now ? 
  in the wake of this crisis there should have been more than enough public pressure to implement any regulation the eu wished . 
  but i am not aware of a large swath of regulations being implemented , so it seems to me ( admittedly i could be wrong on this , i 'm not a financial insider ) that not much about the system has been fixed . 
  i think that since the eu did n't go on a huge pr campaign about regulating bankers this indicates that they have n't done much in this regard . 
  again the eu is n't looking very good . 
  of course a mix of both scenarios is conceivable . 
  so , as in both my thought experiments the eu did n't come out great that means i currently remain sceptic about the ability of the eu to steer the financial market in a way that is beneficial to us europeans . 
  this is were eu criticism in this matter comes from for me . 
  others might see it differently ( and more nuanced ) of course , especially people with better understanding about financial markets than me . 
  edit : added a sentence . 
  the 2 % are not to be spent * on * nato . 
  they will be largely spent on each countries own military . 
  austria is not even in nato so maybe my opinion is n't relevant but is n't the ' 2014 agreement on the 2 % by 2024 thing ' a sign that politicians are * for * it ? 
  besides that i think most people in western europe prefer to see money just go elsewhere rather than the military , to where it is seen as a more worthwhile investment . 
  but if the consensus is that 2 % is what is needed to have adequate defense than so be it . 
  edit : changed 2020 to 2024 . 
  croatia , though admittedly i have n't seen all that much of europe . 
  but i think it 's a great country to visit . 
  if you understand german you can listen to the explanation of the guy who said it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0a64czgz0q ) . 
  for context : he was overheard by a journalist and another woman , stating such comparisons in a conversation during a ball ( there was controversy and demonstrations about the ball too ) - it sparked media outrage in austria when it happened ~ 5 years ago . 
  yeah , the recent corvfefe with the \u00d6vp shook things up a bit , but we 'll have to wait and see what the lasting impact will be . 
  for anyone interested , [ this site ] ( https://neuwal.com/wahlumfragen/index.php?cid=1 ) collects and ranks polls , and displays them on a graph . 
  fp\u00d6 is blue . 
  fp\u00d6 likes to do this , but the ` outsider pants ' do n't fit as well anymore because they poll very high numbers ( largest or second largest party ) for the last 1-2 years . 
  they were part of the government in 2000-2005 , and those years have produced scandals that still occupy the courts today . 
  that has n't stopped them from railing against the ` establishment ' though - even as they themselves are at least as ( and probably much more ) corrupt and focused on their own gain as anyone else - and i doubt they 'll ever change in that respect . 
  what they always strife for is to enforce this ` all against us ' narrative so really the ` outsider ' , ` non-establishment ' thing is just their shtick at this point . 
  edit : fixed grammar mistake, 
  june is the end of may . 
  if the work they do is frequently ( and demonstrably ) done for special interests and also to the detriment of ordinary eu citizens - then the ` roof is aflame ' , as they say . 
  ( which means something needs to then change * urgently * ), 
  lord of the rings is so good . 
  i seriously can not comprehend how it turned out the way it did , it 's such a fluke - akin to the original star wars . 
  ( it obviously did n't have the same impact on cinema though , or was * that * groundbreaking in the vfx department . ), 
  i think that 's false . 
  but i 'm not really familiar with things he said in the past , which may also play a role . 
  ps : [ part of the speech i think this is about ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_yepog5n8k ), 
  it 's true we did . 
  but you kinda dropped the ball on those campaign pledges you made . 
  2/10 would not war the world again - dope uniforms though . 
  no , no . 
  the russian spirit is vodka . 
  maybe terms like ` idealist ' or ` schwarzmaler ' ( ~ pessimist , but not exactly ) . 
  honestly i 'm shocked this is already a meme . 
  i just feel insulted that this symbol of our nation is appropriated for an advertisement , it somehow really bugs me . 
  but if you think it 's fine i 'm not holding it against you . 
  no why would we ? 
  [ \u0ca0_\u0ca0 ] ( https://www.stiegl.at/sites/default/files/styles/top_teaser/public/images/pages/img_4194_0.jpg?itok=ccet0cjx ) i hate whoever came up with that . 
  [ duuuuuuude , fuck you . 
  ] ( https://www.90minuten.at/images/newsarchive/images/original/3b92dgepa_full_9653_gepa-07061364067_09817_r_1280x720.jpg ) [ seriously . 
  it makes me so angry . 
  and they 're everywhere . 
  i think skepticism as a general attitude is the way to go . 
  if someone tells you his ` facts ' and what * he * thinks follows from them , you listen to what is said ( if it is interesting to you ) and when he is finished ( or you lost interest ) you go away and try to verify the facts he talked about and employ your own reasoning to build an opinion for yourself . 
  after that maybe you think back on it and try to contrast what you have found with the information you 've originally been given . 
  can you do this for every information you encounter ? 
  no , but the more outrageous and ` earth shattering ' the claim put to you is , the more important it is for you to be skeptical . 
  `` extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . '', 
  - is a good doctrine , i think . 
  once a source has been shown , through your own investigation/reasoning to have been wrong then there must be a loss of ` trust ' proportional to how wrong you think the information given to you was , so it can be hard to take the same source serious in the future . 
  in short - try to rely on your own thinking ( to the degree this is possible , some topics can be very hard to understand or to get hold of the big picture ) and use multiple credible sources to gather the facts ( and also their different approaches of what follows from them ) from which you start your own reasoning on a subject . 
  if you do not have the time for all of this then you can of course still enjoy infotainment , but you need to be aware that the information given to you is highly suspect and you must hesitate to integrate anything given to you into your worldview . 
  ** i think one of the few ways to combat false information in media is to promote skepticism ** , but not everyone wants to have an accurate worldview - some just want to be ` right ' . 
  you 'll never convince those people to this approach , because it means you 're never 100 % certain , but the best you 'll ever get is ` high confidence ' that something you think about the world approximates the truth to a satisfying degree - this is what you call ` truth ' . 
  the article is quite clear that this is just a vague proposal , and that many of its propositions exceed the authority of the development minister ( who i understand is the person behind it , this is n't an official plan from ` germany ' ) , and even germany herself . 
  i think the eu is the entity which would have to implement a plan of this magnitude , but i acknowledge that getting it ` out there ' to the populace that something like this is what germany wants may just be a way to drum up support . 
  there are * a lot * of stations something like this has to run through in the eu so this is n't even a start , really . 
  my perception is that there 's not really anything concrete to talk about here , beyond the discussion of `` should we do something '' . 
  edit : added a sentence . 
  in my experience it * is * typical to tip in restaurants with about 10 % - at least in vienna it is . 
  edit : oh and it is normal for the waiter to only check every once in a while if you want anything after your first order . 
  so if you want something it is completely normal to give him a signal when he walks by you . 
  my main problem with ` small talk with * strangers * ' is that i know that people would be too polite to tell me that they do n't want to talk right now , and i would n't want to force something on them they do not want - i know this would happen because i myself have been too polite to end conversations i did not want to have . 
  it also feels like intruding on someone 's privacy when you just start to talk to them . 
  you should have a better reason than `` i 'm bored and i presume you 're also bored '' . 
  it just is n't something that 's done . 
   do europeans not make friends that way ? 
  most certainly we do not make friends that way . 
  do you guys honestly start friendships like that ? 
  how many friends would you say is an average number to have ? 
  maybe it would even be better to define ` friend ' . 
  people i work with are ` colleagues ' , other people i meet semi-frequently - maybe a neighbour or someone who frequents the same social circles as me and whom i meet randomly from time to time - are acquaintances . 
  only people whom i * choose * to meet in my spare time i would consider friends . 
  ps : is ` whom ' used correctly here ? 
  i can never figure it out . 
  edit : reading it again i think whom is wrong ... or is it ? ... hmm ... 
  edit2 : corrected spelling, 
  oh , i think i misinterpreted even your earlier comments , sorry . 
  i think a lot of people would not know that the ` articles of confederation ' are not part of the modern usa , or what the ` confederation ' was , and so would assume you draw parallels between the usa of today and the eu . 
  ( like i did ) so it would probably be a good idea to be extra clear , and not expect people to be very knowledgeable about a short period in the history of the usa . 
  it is an interesting historical point . 
  i would say that countries being worried about their sovereignty , ( maybe only on the surface to whip up the electorate at home ) and causing internal troubles is a thing for the eu .
