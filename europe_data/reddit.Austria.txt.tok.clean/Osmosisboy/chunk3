  well , he could dissolve government , it 's just that no president ever used his powers to this extent . 
  i am suddenly gripped by a strong feeling ... is that ... what ... being informed feels like ? 
  hey come on , we just export this nazi crap . 
  ( and hand our nation willingly to them if they come back popular . ), 
  careful now , or i might marry you . 
  what 's the u.e. 
  vienna apparently moved 200 kilometers or so in a southwesterly direction . 
  the sun does n't even have a decent map of europe . 
  cheers !, 
  ( and good night ), 
  okay . 
  i 'm sorry if you perceived anything i wrote as demeaning to anybody . 
  but frankly i have to say i find it hard to believe that you interpreted anything in my post or comment as putting highly educated people above less educated ones . 
  the word ` better ' is not even used in my post . 
  also i did not discuss ` right ' or ` wrong ' choices for voters . 
  i 'm just baffled by this . 
  wait you can do that ? 
  any hungarians want to help me veto wwi ? 
  if you look at the fp\u00d6 's ( and hofer 's ) voter demographic you can see a clear relation between education and number of votes . 
  coupled with the traditionally weaker results in the postal vote it is a valid guess that more higher educated people make use of the postal vote . 
  proof : if you look at this graph http://cf.datawrapper.de/kmwlz/1/#0 ; blue is the fp\u00d6 and the buttons in the top left corner show the distributions of votes for different levels of education , increasing from left to right . 
  the numbers used in this graph are from the eu election 2014 found at the bottom at page six in this analysis : http://www.sora.at/fileadmin/downloads/wahlen/2014_eu-wahl_wahlanalyse.pdf . 
  this relation with education holds true for all fp\u00d6 election results i have ever seen . 
  you own a pet dinosaur ? 
  that can speak ? 
  ( they are melting . 
  but i guess you did n't care . 
  xd edit : in previous rulings from the verfassungsgerichtshof , the ** possibility ** of fraud was enough . 
  no i did not . 
  and even at the danger that you will spin something i have not said out of it i would hazard the guess that at least half of the population of austria does not count as ' ** highly ** educated ' . 
  at least under most definitions of highly educated . 
  thank you for your time explaining this . 
  one question though : why do we need some kind of ` special settlement court ' to decide this ? 
  why ca n't we use normal courts and let this play out in the open , for all to see whats going on ? 
  could n't we make those isds-proceedings part of our court system ? 
  i get that maybe there is a fear that state judges * might * not be completely neutral , even if they are supposed to be . 
  but that does not mean i can trust any other form of judicature . 
  i just ca n't see me accepting jurisdiction coming from outside a democratic government and i fear the reasons corporations would push for that . 
  yes , but as i have tried to explain that might not be good enough . 
  there is real precedent that the verfassungsgerichtshof will see the `` possibility '' of fraud as enough to declare the election void . 
  even if absolutely no proof for that possible fraud emerges . 
  yes , but they also have to witness the proceedings when the postal votes are counted . 
  in some cases that can mean thousands of letters and so the authorities can bring extra manpower in to help . 
  okay , but would n't that then be just a standard clause all investors would demand ? 
  i mean why would n't they add to every contract : `` oh , by the way you gave this deal to encourage us and we would not invest without that deal . '', 
  sorry if i seem ignorant , but that 's because i am . 
  i admit i have no clue what ceta really means . 
  that makes it really hard to support . 
  and my default stance is ` skeptic ' . 
  please no . 
  wow , amazing . 
  her arguments remain rational but she is also clearly moved and emotional . 
  she seems like what i would want all politicians to be . 
  ( of course that 2 minute clip is n't enough to accurately judge someone though . ), 
  seems to me like investors will be able to judge for themselves if investments of this kind are worth it to them in romania . 
  under ceta they would be enticed to just make such investments because they can always get their money back . 
  ohhhhh thanks . 
   that sort of thing really is what i want to read in international papers about my country . 
  so ... fingers crossed for reelections ? 
  a good portion of election officials * did * manage to follow the law completely . 
  those that did n't were a mix of `` did not take all those guidelines seriously , did my own thing '' and `` i thought they were too much work , but did n't want to call for extra manpower cause that would look bad to my boss '' . 
  also `` we always did it that way '' was a thing . 
  oh , i 'm paraphrasing by the way , but that 's the gist of it . 
  maybe we can actually call it a war this time too ( ukraine anyone ? ) . 
  with nations declaring it openly , as the populations in europe no longer give a fuck about other countries . 
  if the court rules to void the election , of course i would support that ; i trust the constitutional court in austria and i think they have done a good job in the past . 
  while no cameras were allowed during the witness statements , journalists were allowed in and they did report the statements . 
  honestly , i would not have thought it possible the fp\u00d6 could win this , but after hearing some of those statements i now believe they have a very good shot and a solid case . 
  laws were definitely broken/disregarded . the letter-vote-counting i have never perceived to be a problem , but the fp\u00d6 had always claimed things were wrong with it because it never went in their favor . 
  the court will rule in the coming weeks , i would estimate a 50/50 chance they declare the election void . 
  some people have raised the question of what exactly would have to be repeated . 
  the whole election including the formerly eliminated candidates , or just the run-off ballot ? 
  i do n't know but i think just the latter is more likely . 
  true , but if the constitutional court actually follows their line of reasoning that would be a huge deal . 
  normally they just whine for a bit and then let it go . 
  now they really have a solid case , this degree of sloppiness can hardly be tolerated . 
  edit : why did he get downvoted ? 
  i do n't get reddit sometimes . 
  great , now i have to listen to putin gloating . 
  what a time to be alive ... and unemployed . 
  `` i came to brussels as someone who had campaigned against britain joining the euro and who was skeptical about europe , '' hill said on saturday . 
  `` i will leave it certain that , despite its frustrations , our membership was good for our place in the world and good for our economy . 
  but what is done can not be undone and now we have to get on with making our new relationship with europe work as well as possible . '' - quote from him .

  well that seems to make sense . 
  but how would you say this meshes with the uk playing for time ( at least to me it seems like they do ) ? 
  do they just see things differently ? 
  are banks not as much a priority as keeping those trade deals a bit longer ? 
  but would n't a `` done deal '' make frankfurt even more desirable ? 
  at the moment it 's all in limbo and uncertain . 
  how strange . 
  i wonder what her reasoning is . 
  edit : i mean her saying that time is not an issue . 
  i agree there is no need to be nasty out of spite . 
  for me it is very much a trust issue . 
  during the last eu-parliament election in 2014 there was practically no campaigning in austria because the parties just did n't seem to care ( i gather it 's much the same in most countries in the eu ) . 
  that means their views and goals were not openly discussed . 
  how could i possibly trust them if i know virtually nothing about them , or what they hope to achieve ? 
  couple this with all the lobbying firms situated in and around brussels .
