  the way the [ eu institutions ] ( http://en.strasbourg-europe.eu/detailed-explanations-about-the-institutions-of-the-european-union,3214,en.html ) ( most notably the commision , the european council , the council of europe and also the eu parliament ) are set up and work with each other is in my opinion absolutely not comparable to how the usa functioned as a nation under the articles of confederation - i admit i just skimmed the wikipedia article pertaining to the ` articles of confederation ' so i could be wrong , but this is my impression . 
  also the technology of today permits us to share complex information with a large number of people and in a short amount of time , which is something that is critical if you have a number of countries who each need to have the full picture because of the way national governments play an important part in the eu decision making . 
  this is something that just was n't possible 240 years ago . 
  i mean , even if you believe that the eu is working like the usa of old - does n't that then mean that you must also believe the countries in the eu to hold their sovereignty today ? 
  since that was the case for the us . 
  the quote about the us you used continues :  the articles created a loose confederation of sovereign states and a weak central government , leaving most of the power with the state governments . 
  the need for a stronger federal government soon became apparent and eventually led to the constitutional convention in 1787 . 
  the present united states constitution replaced the articles of confederation on march 4 , 1789 . 
  so you kind of misstated how similar the us and the eu are today . 
  i do n't think i 've actually seen shawshank redemption , maybe i will do so tonight , looks like a good movie . 
  but this means i 'm not sure what you meant with that . 
  i was wondering about how he was portrait in the book too and reread it a week ago . 
  i think in the book he is n't as ` panicky ' and prone to ridicule or deny the impossible things he is witnessing , with some sort of offhand comment . 
  he seems more resigned with the situation and accepting of it , possibly because he is still in a deep state of shock from what happens to him at the beginning , but to reiterate he is n't panicky , only sort of numb when the story starts . 
  i thought of him as a very steady and reliable person , someone who takes what is happening seriously but knows how to cope . 
  also i got the sense he got some agency of his own in the things he did as the story went along . 
  in the show he is more of a complete playball for the gods , denies what is happening to him all the time , and many of the attributes i listed before are n't shown in his character . 
  this is just my take on it of course , and it is pretty subjective . 
  i 'm a bit worried about the actor for shadow . 
  or maybe how they direct him to play his character - i 'm just not really feeling it . 
  the gods are well cast though .

  i always thought we were well regarded inside the eu as some kind of ` middle man ' , someone who was seen as reasonable and respected enough - or trustworthy enough - so that if there were dissenting opinions in the eu , austrian officials could step over the lines that are formed and talk to everyone , speeding up the process to find a solution . 
  maybe i always read this wrong and this is just how we liked to portray ourselves in our own media - but i think it 's at least possible that this is what we did for international relations . 
  this last years however severely tarnished all of this . 
  i think we were often with those who act divisive and irrational , because we had no reasoning to back up the ideas austrian official peddled in brussels . 
  i fear we are n't taken as seriously anymore , that maybe the perception is our politicians try to use the eu stage simply to aggrandize themselves for the audience at home . 
  a perception i 'm sad to say i think is accurate . 
  i hope osce missions do not suffer because of our snap election , austria currently is heading the osce which means our foreign minister is its chairperson . 
  this minister is also deeply embroiled in the current happenings in government , and was just named the new head of his party . 
  so i hope he does n't put his main job ( he * is * the foreign minister ) on the back burner . 
  i think political grandstanding will experience a new frenzy in the upcoming months to the elections and austria will suffer for it . 
  europe 's economy has shown an upswing and maybe we all will experience a sizeable boom - it 's a shame that in a time when lawmakers could impact the economy so much we will probably be so busy throwing rocks in each others paths that we will miss out on so much we could have achieved otherwise . 
  it reminded me a lot of this part [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7behkgoa86u&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=759 ) - though i recognize it 's not really about the same topic . 
  i 'd agree with this statement : `` the government should guarantee equal opportunity '' , though i suspect that this means something very different for me than for you . 
  for example public health care is something i take to provide equal opportunity , and you seem to have this on the ` equal outcome ' side of things . 
  the other part of the statement `` the government should not guarantee equal outcomes '' can mean a lot of things , i do n't know what you are aiming at there exactly . 
  and at a glance my gut feeling would be that i agree with it . 
  however i support many of the things you listed in your edit - basically some amount of wealth redistribution - especially when it comes to health care and how taxation works . 
  also your examples do not contain ` equal outcomes ' as i would understand it , since ` everyone gets housing ' is very much different from ` everyone gets equal housing ' . 
  to explain what i mean , i hope that you would agree that , for example , ` everyone gets housing ' is a very different thing from ` equal outcomes ' , since you must acknowledge that there are a lot of different kinds of housing . 
  and so the outcome is n't necessarily the same for everyone , even if the government provides housing for the poor . 
  basically i think the most basic needs like food and shelter should be a given , but this only serves as a start ramp for you to become a productive member of society , and should be on the low end of the quality spectrum - just meant as a temporary measure . 
  when you say that ` another way of phrasing ' , `` the government should guarantee equal opportunity , not equal outcomes . 
  '' , is to say `` is the societal `` greater good '' more important than individualism ? 
  '' , i have to disagree , those phrases mean different things to me . 
  the water in vienna is mostly from springs in the alps ( ~ 95 % ) . 
  if there is a sudden jump in demand they also add some water from ground wells ( ~ 5 % ) . 
  the distance the water needs to travel to reach vienna is about 150 kilometers , but since it comes from the mountains this can be done without pumping - we even use its potential energy to generate electricity while it is on its way down to the city . 
  i do n't think we add anything to the water , but i 'm not exactly sure . 
  the water is regarded as ` soft water ' , so there is n't a lot of calcium and magnesium - which would be responsible for ` chalk ' , and other deposits in pipes - in it . 
  it tastes pretty good , i 'd even say that we are a bit ` known ' in the eastern part of austria for our good water . 
  ` city of god ' ( ` cidade de deus ' ) is an excellent movie . 
  there are only a couple other ` foreign ' movies i 'd consider equally well made . 
  my favourite one is perhaps ' [ downfall ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0363163/ ) ' ( ` der untergang ' , germany , 2004 ) , which is about the last days of nazi germany and specifically about how hitler personally might have experienced them . 
  you can watch this [ short scene ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt3v7tigsro ) from the beginning of the movie if you 're curious ( you can enable subtitles ) . 
  other very good ones i 'd recommend are : * [ crouching tiger , hidden dragon ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190332/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) ( ` wo hu cang long ' , chinese , 2000 ) * [ oldboy ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364569/ ) ( ` oldeuboi ' , south korean , 2003 ) * [ das boot ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/ ) ( ` das boot ' , west germany , 1981 ), 
  in my experience meaning varies from country to country and even from citizen to citizen inside a country . 
  this makes the term nearly useless inside of a discussion because you 'd first have to establish a common meaning for conservative/liberal that is accepted by all participants of said discussion - so best just leave it out , talk about concrete policies or aims that have been set , find common ground and see how the discussion goes from there . 
  as to `` am i confused by the american usage of the terms '' - actually i often am , because i 've observed some kind of truism . 
  it seems that conservative is what conservatives do ( i.e. 
  what the republican party decides ) , and liberal is what the liberals do ( i.e. 
  what the democratic party decides ) . 
  there does n't seem to be much more to it . 
  only some historic points about what the parties have done in the past . 
  so saying you support the democrats because of the liberal values seems to me like you 're saying you support democrats because they are democrats . 
  which is n't saying anything by itself . 
  maybe i 'm not immersed enough into american politics to really understand those terms and their usefulness . 
  but i got to say the way they are used to draw battle lines in a discussion , which would be better served to stick to political realities and to avoid simple labels , is worrisome to me . 
  you made [ some upgrades ] ( https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hajhunezyfa/u9jbnhtz3ui/aaaaaaaaa0y/dmjr9c4t07u/w736-h505-no/upgrading+the+steyr.jpg ) on them . 
  nice . 
  is n't the likely replacement also going to come from hk ? 
  ( [ hk416 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heckler_%26_koch_hk416 ) is what i heard floating around , though it 's just a rumour ), 
  i shot it . 
  it works without issues , is easy to handle ( i really like the ergonomics ) and requires little effort to maintain . 
  i 'd say the trigger is a bit ` meh ' , not exactly snappy . 
  bonus tip : do n't touch the black metal parts ( other than the scope ) after shooting it a lot , those things can get surprisingly hot . 
  probably because of the austria/australia thing . 
  it 's the only explanation that would make sense really . 
  skiing - but the real skiing where they ski down a mountain . 
  not the fake kind where they need to use their arms to push themselves because it is so flat . 
  summer olympics we do n't even mention here ... with the exception of sailing maybe . 
  personally i really like sailing but i think the format would need some work . 
   it is unclear whether member states can rescind their declaration of withdrawal during the negotiation period when their country still is a member of the european union . 
  from [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/article_50_of_the_treaty_on_european_union#re-entry_or_unilateral_revocation ) . 
  the european parliament thinks article 50 can not be revoked unilaterally by the uk , while the uk government says it `` does not know for sure '' . 
  [ ` real humans ' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2180271/ ) was a great swedish show . 
  remade in america it was merely ok . 
  thinking a bit about it i think i would only touch someone else 's child if it is an emergency . 
  if it just scraped its knee i would ask it if everything is okay and where the parents are . 
  being called a pedophile for helping a child up would be pretty overblown but i would understand it if the mum tells me to go away in such a situation . 
  the `` deal '' would be that the uk has to have a sane public debate about what they want from the eu , and where they want to see it headed in the future . 
  this would conclude in some kind of referendum which would serve as the basis for a declaration of the uk government , making it clear to everyone what they hope to achieve within the eu . 
  if i find this declaration believable and also to be meant in earnest , and if it is compatible with my own wishes about the eu , then i would support the uk rejoining the eu . 
  other than that it is kind of hard to answer your question since in a decade the eu might look very different - what with ` two speed eu ' , or ` closer financial ties ' and other ideas floating around currently . 
  probably one of the people shown [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c7wkpl0ukq ) . 
  what 's the reasoning behind naming cities after cities ? 
  exactly . 
  sure it 's accurate . 
  renaming * all the units * that there are to ` pound ' would n't adversely effect accuracy .
