  it would however make all the scientists go crazy . 
  sorry but i am a bit confused about this myself - i 'm austrian so i 've never known victory . 
  maybe someone else can explain it ? 
  oh no , you changed it the wrong way - now the poor americans wo n't understand what you 're talking about . 
  here you go american friends :  ... bill and jack tell you that it 's ** v ** miles ...  ... you can buy ** x ** gallons of water . 
   x gallons they still use roman numerals in the usa ? 
  a bit weird ... but i can certainly believe it . 
  might want to edit the first sentence of the second paragraph from the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metric_system ) , to make your claim more credible . 
   the metric system has been officially sanctioned for use in the united states since 1866 , [ 2 ] but the us remains the only industrialised country that has ** not ** adopted the metric system as ** its official system of measurement ** -- anyway , it makes perfect sense that there can only be a singular original object for something like defining mass , since from this one object everything else derives - even if you , say , divide the objects mass then by 2 ( or some other , crazier number ) and give it a freedom name , like pound ( to then name the unit for ` force ' also pound is * a bit much * if you ask me ) . 
  the metric system has also undergone some changes and its official name is [ ` international system of units ' \\ ( or si-system \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_system_of_units ) , colloquially it 's still often called the ` metric system ' though . 
  edit : added a bit to the first sentence . 
  the flapping of the wings of a distant butterfly . 
  there are seasons ? 
  there 's no way you could fight this . 
  submit !, 
  i just wanted to explain - there 's no need to rescind anything or side with anyone . 
  [ i am from austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmsa_xb2h5u ), 
  i 'm not talking about hate . 
  i 'm referring to the ' [ verbotsgesetz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/verbotsgesetz_1947 ) ' in austria , which was updated in the 90 's to explicitly include holocaust denial - which is something that crops up every now and then . 
  it includes things in the vein of this :  whoever in a printed work , on broadcasting or in any other media , or whoever otherwise publicly in a matter that makes it accessible to many people , denies , belittles , condones or tries to justify the nazi genocide or other nazi crimes against humanity shall be punished with imprisonment for ( ... ) i do n't see how it would be a slippery slope since this law does n't necessitate doing anything else - so there is no cascading effect here . 
  it is also in place for more than two decades now and i do n't have observed anything sliding down a slope - so to speak . 
   i would rather run the risk of allowing evil to speak its mind as opposed to the risk of potentially shutting up good . 
  so you 'd open pandora 's box , being well aware of its content ? 
  ... i 'm not really serious about that last one , it does n't add anything tangible to the debate , just thought it would be an interesting remark . 
  free speech can be turned against you too . 
  i think there 's a balance to be struck here . 
  yeah , faust is something you read toward the end of high school . 
  i can also remember that we read ' [ jugend ohne gott ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/jugend_ohne_gott ) ' - de wiki link , could n't find it in english . 
  it 's very good , i very much recommend reading it - and [ ` krabat ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krabat_\\ ( novel \\ ) ) in german . 
  also we read shakespear in german , which is maybe a bit weird . 
  in english class i remember reading [ ` animal farm ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/animal_farm ) and [ ` misery ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misery_\\ ( novel \\ ) ) . 
  i do n't know , there are just some ideologies/ideas you should n't be allowed to disseminate . 
  and i 'm glad there are laws in place to set some kind of line - we got enough people here skirting it , even occasionally stepping over it . 
  i would agree that laws in this area are especially sensitive and have to be made with special deliberation and transparency . 
  my understanding is that there are refined mathematical models which only need a tiny amount of real world data to extrapolate from this the result with a very high degree of certainty . 
  so when the polls close they count a tiny fraction of the votes and feed its information ( that 's who the vote was cast for and also * where * this vote was cast ) into the model . 
  it is much more accurate than predictions using only surveys because it has real data from the election . 
  this gives you a predicted result plus an error margin of initially maybe 1 or 2 % which then shrinks to almost nothing once ~ 1/4 of the vote is counted . 
  it 's not just france who does this but many other countries as well . 
  of course once all the votes are counted there will be an official announcement - but the prediction alone is often enough to trigger a concession speech . 
  ` fails us ' seems a weird way to phrase it . 
  i think ` disappoint ' would be a better word . 
  you did n't want our ' [ greater german solution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question ) ' , so now be ` kleindeutschland ' and leave us alone . 
  hungary where are you ? 
  help me out here , i know you understand ... please help us stay relevant . 
  even if it were - if you remove any major part of an arch it will collapse . 
  what about the uk you ask ? 
  well , metaphors suck , i say . 
  yeah , you can say `` geiles auto '' ( cool car ) or `` was f\u00fcr ein geiles konzert . '', 
  ( what a cool concert ) but `` i think hans is cool . '', 
  would n't work like that , because `` ich finde hans ist geil . '', 
  is a bit weird ... unless you are a bit turned on by [ hans ] ( https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/hans11.jpg ) . 
  then it seems clear to me that only those who share the same feelings , or the same morality would find such an argument compelling . 
  i think a logically sound reasoning is one of the few ways we have to reach others and have them truly understand our own point of view . 
  i know however that logic can be insufficient ( it can also be very hard to evaluate the logic of an argument ) and morality and feelings are important , but when talking about these things it has to be done in a non-threatening way and generally you can get entangled in ` dead end ' debates very easily that way - of course there are also those who do not want to actually debate anything , they just want to have their attitudes validated by others . 
  i like to think that if you make a well reasoned argument it is taken seriously here and on / r/europe , obviously you have to be especially careful if you want to make a statement that goes against the stream . 
  the problem many seem to encounter is that their argument relies on some premises they consider to be already accepted , and so if they make that argument in a forum where the premises are very much still a part of the debate their statement is considered ill-reasoned . 
  you have to ground the premises of your argument with some logic of their own , or with evidence in the form of credible data - preferably both . 
  i know this is much to ask from an internet forum , particularly one that is used by many primarily for entertainment , but this is how constructive debate has to happen . 
  edit : added last sentence . 
  that germans seem to think we austrians especially like them amongst all our other neighbours . 
  ^ ^ / s. . . ? ... it 's ^ ^ complicated ... 
  hey now , i hear there 's some ink on it too . 
  [ 1866 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question#austro-prussian_war_and_franco-prussian_war ) , worst year of my life . 
  it will be returned to you once you integrate yourself back into the empire . 
  goal/mission is too strong a word . 
  i would certainly say there is an underlying purpose or reason for nations - many reasons even . 
  also , for me ` human civilzation ' is more like an umbrella term for the achievements of humanity , so it ca n't really have a goal or purpose itself . 
  nah , it 's that `` every year , we 'd go back ( ... ) '' is a bit too close to reality . 
  you do n't seem to understand - if we grab a port we austrians would have a port . 
  we might even have a k.u.k. 
  navy again , the port is the key . 
  all other considerations must come second !, 
  that ' / s ' right there means we are still one united empire deep down . 
  in the case of ww1 they primarily wanted to ensure germany would lose - at the time it looked like the eastern front against russia might be won for germany , since they won quite a few battles there and also russia had internal troubles ( revolution ) . 
  if germany could focus it 's forces just on the west , they could possibly win the war . 
  the us did not want germany to establish a european hegemony . 
  i mean it probably was ` the right thing ' to get involved in it for the usa - for their own geopolitical reasons . 
  i do n't think countries go to war for moral reasons , they do it because they have something to gain from it - be it material or something like influence , or to secure their own safety . 
  they shot the archduke - guess we had to march our young into a meat grinder . 
  italy . 
  cassus belli would be that we 'd * really * like a port . 
  so that would be the goal - take a port , does n't really matter which one , though trieste would probably be my first pick . 
  hell , even a town near the sea would be a good start . 
  we would lose pretty soon though , our only hope would be that maybe south tyrol remembers it 's actually austria too and complicates matters for the italians . 
  a testament to the hubris of man . ^ ^ also ^ ^ an ^ ^ art ^ ^ museum [ -  wiki link ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kunsthaus_graz ), 
  oh , how i wish i could [ forget ] ( https://www.museum-joanneum.at/fileadmin/user_upload/kunsthaus/hausseite/slider_kunsthaus_1160x560.jpg ) . 
  haha xd well , if you can read german this [ wikipedia page ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hall_\\ ( ortsname \\ ) ) has lots of info . 
  edit : there 's also a list of cities/towns which have ` hall ' in their name - there are quite a few . 
  i read up on it and apparently etymologists are pretty convinced that the term ` hall ' ( as used in ' * hall * statt ' ) has * something * to do with salt - but what it means exactly is unclear . 
  anyway , that our towns have lots to do with salt is pretty fitting , as we austrians are pretty salty most of the time . 
  how are they called ? 
  i do n't think we even have those - or maybe i just have n't heard about them . 
  in that case maybe you have n't seen [ vienna ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=vienna&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1c1gtpm_enat706at706&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj4w7ii5dbtahwbrrokhxp6br4q_auicigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ) ? 
  it 's pretty well known , but paris is on another level entirely . 
  edit : i think i know what you mean now , it just shows the most famous buildings but no pictures of the whole city . 
  ugh , how embarrassing ... 
  thank you for making me aware . 
  [ innsbruck ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=innsbruck&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjrrohw2tbtahvcmbokhcsdbh0q_auibigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ) ( i just love the mountains ) [ salzburg ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=salzburg&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewidn8tx2tbtahxqdrokhsn6ar0q_auibigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ) ... and [ ~ ~ hallstadt ~ ~ hallstatt ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=hallstadt&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjower72tbtahwbwrokhz3tdh8q_auibigb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=950 ) these might all be a bit clich\u00e9 and well known , maybe someone else has something a bit more ` underground ' ?
