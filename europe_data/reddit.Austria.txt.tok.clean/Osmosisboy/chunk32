  depends , if it 's in a speech it would be pretty bad - but there 's also no way that would ever happen . 
  what 's at least possible is that she might be caught by a rogue mic somewhere . 
  you know - standing around with a couple other people ( all would have to be pretty good friends ) in a semi-private setting , and telling a bad joke , maybe just a stir of the moment thing . 
  still seems almost impossible , of course . 
  there 'd probably be a sizeable scandal , but i do n't think she necessarily would have to resign over this . 
  i just do n't see it happening , though - i ca n't even picture her telling a regular joke . 
  ehhhh ... when i mouseover your flag it says chad . 
  did you confuse the [ chad flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/flag_of_chad.svg/1280px-flag_of_chad.svg.png ) with the [ romanian flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/flag_of_romania.svg/2000px-flag_of_romania.svg.png ) ? 
  or ... have i been trolled ... ? 
  anyway , the protests a couple weeks ago were really inspiring . 
  i hope chad pulls through . ^ ^ and ^ ^ romania ^ ^ too, 
  i always believed the end justifies the means - at least so long as no one on either side is left alive by the end . 
  that way the end is truly just . 
  do n't bring me problems but focus on the whole picture - that we 're awesome !, 
  free cake for everyone . 
  i 'm golfing . 
   american government 's alliance with israel is solid and openly supported ... which is morally right considering jewish people were treated horrifically . 
  if the support for someone else is ` morally right ' hinges mostly on what actions you are supporting . 
  not really on the past of whoever it is you support . 
  at least that 's how i would see it . 
  of course there can be the matter of ` guilt ' , which may complicate the dealings , but after decades when almost everyone who was alive at the time is dead and everyone acknowledges that what happened was bad and also the responsible generation has made an honest effort to pay back the guilt , then it may no longer be reasonable to carry that guilt - just an accurate description of what happened , and to take on the responsibility of it not happening again . 
  my view on the american indigenous population is that most of them today seem to live in poverty and that they have their rights impinged upon * today * ( keystone pipeline is built on their land against their wishes , if i 'm not misinformed ) . 
  so this is where efforts to be just must be concentrated . 
  we can not go through thousands of years of our own history and fix every mistake or evil deed ever done in the past . 
  similarly we can not teach about everything that ever happened in school - i find it hard to believe that you would n't learn about their plight in school though since it relates strongly to the usa . 
   do you believe the usa is really an immigrant friendly and diversified nation ? 
  what are your thoughts on this ? 
  i 'd say the usa is probably the most diverse nation i know of . 
  regarding immigration , my understanding is that it is pretty hard to immigrate legally to the us compared to other nations ( correct me if i 'm wrong though ) - especially if you are poor and have bad qualifications . 
  there is a plaque on the ` statue of liberty ' in new york which reads : `` give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore . 
  send these , the homeless , tempest-tossed to me , i lift my lamp beside the golden door ! '', 
  these lines are from the poem '' [ the new colossus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_new_colossus ) , '' written by emma lazarus in 1883 . 
  i believe this is how america likes to view itself and , for a time , this is what it was regarding immigration . 
  but today its immigration policies do not match this sentiment . 
  is n't ` non legal immigration ' already ` banned ' ? 
  i mean it 's illegal . 
  of course there 's lots you could change when enforcing the law . 
  i really do n't want people around me to carry a firearm , it would make me very uncomfortable . 
  pump action shotguns belong to [ ` category a - restricted firearms ' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation#austria ) - not sure why though . 
  just wanted to add that . 
  austrian gun law is already very strict . 
  in your example the eu would be far more damaged by their vindictiveness against the uk , than it would be by possible uk trade deals . 
  the eu can ill afford to give its detractors ammunition of that calibre . 
  when the usa chooses its president , they 're not electing their best . 
  they 're not choosing * you * . 
  they 're not electing * you * . 
  they 're voting for people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with them into office . 
  they 're bringing a sense of entitlement . 
  they 're bringing corruption . 
  they 're gluttonous . 
  and some , i assume , are good people . 
  you should n't use this kind of tone . 
  however , i also share your exasperation about it all . 
  germans * really * want to win , it 's like they 're at work or something and have to ` achieve ' . 
  which can be a good thing , but can get exhausting sometimes . 
  also hochdeutsch ( high german ) can get really annoying to hear after a while , it really bleeds through and colours their english too . 
  i do n't blame them personally for this though - poor bastards do n't even know they talk piefkinesisch . 
  the french talk french . 
  do n't know what it 's about . 
  eastern europeans can have an accent that 's hard to understand , but they bravely try to communicate . 
  ( just like us austrians probably ) i see americans very seldomly but i had some positive encounters , they like to talk and were very friendly and helpful . 
  uk is the same as americans but with a kick ass accent . 
  russians do russian stuff . 
  -- it 's a shame that talking in english can be very hard when you do n't have much practice . 
  the typical chatter i 've seen americans get in their games , i 've rarely seen in europe . 
  while we can convey information , it takes a bit of concentration to form coherent sentences in another language - something which you ca n't afford while playing a competitive game . 
  so in my experience there is often no non-essential talking going on in europe . 
  overall i think he is a mess . 
  what surprised me a bit is that there seems to be so little coordination between white house/senate , and white house/congress , my understanding is that to enact change that lasts multiple presidencies you 'd need them all to work together to make laws . 
  i also think that with the way he slashes at climate protection in the usa , this at a time where we would need to act decisively to counter the worst excesses of it , he is going to have a lasting negative impact on all of us . 
  here is an [ interview with trump ] ( https://apnews.com/c810d7de280a47e88848b0ac74690c83 ) about his first 100 days done by the ` associated press ' , if anyone is interested . 
  i 'm always amazed by the way he talks - i find it scary that he is n't immediately seen as a posturing buffoon by the overwhelming majority who witness him . 
  i think the usa flag is a bit of a magnet for downvotes - maybe people tend to be harsher on non-europeans ? 
  i 'm not really sure though , maybe people are just wary of leading questions , i 've seen some of those around . 
  i have to say i also only started frequenting this sub recently , so maybe it 's just that americans often have the same kind of questions and people here just want to see something a bit different . 
  i worry a bit about not being welcoming enough though . 
  edit : clarified a bit . 
  i 'd add ` heisl ' , otherwise this list is perfect . 
  the literal translations of the words often would n't really be obscene , for example ` blunzen ' just means ` blood sausage ' . 
  and you 'd just say something like `` k\u00fcmmer di um danen eiganen dreck , du deppate blade blunzn . '', 
  - for example , if you want to insult someone who 's a bit fat . 
  edit : oh , i just realised [ ` deppat ' \\ ( or ` deppert ' \\ ) ] ( https://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/deppert ) might be * the * essential insult in austria ( or maybe only vienna ? ) . 
  we use it all the time , in a myriad of combinations . 
  if i remember correctly , jfk 's devoutness was considered a liability when he ran for president - obviously there has been some kind of shift since then . 
   caravan palace they are great !, 
  i did n't realize they were french . 
  ` kanzler ' also has a neat translation as ` chancellor ' into english . 
  english speakers know that word and so it makes sense to use it . 
   you 're mostly young men who lean left . 
  i guess you 're right about the makeup of this sub . 
  still , if you establish a premise or background for your question without any reasoning and/or data it 's considered bad form . 
  edit : i want to add that there are those who think the right/left thing is more harmful than anything else . 
  there are different definitions for what right and left means . 
  ` right wing ' policies can also turn into ` left wing ' policies and vice versa . 
  i think it is used to draw battle lines and not as something to help people grasp issues quickly . 
  i think he just did . 
  imagine what else must be possible - the internet is a scary place . 
  lol , i 'm wondering how often i 've made that spelling mistake in the past . 
  in german ` australia ' is called ` australien ' - the ` australians ' living there are called ` australier ' . 
  there are a thousand comments about it in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67g72d/eu_strengthens_control_of_the_acquisition_and/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) from yesterday in / r/europe , if you 're interested in it .
