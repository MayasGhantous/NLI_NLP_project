  it 's more like a festival . 
  i beg to differ . 
  it is democratic , the western states pay a reasonable amount , and it permits the states of europe to stay relevant in a global context and thereby shape the world we live in . 
  since the ` authority of a state to govern itself ' is not given up - rather the state retains ultimate authority ( everyone can leave anytime ) - i 'd argue that sovereignty is not diminished . 
  i think there 's much to be criticised in our military , but a neutral country ordinarily would need a stronger army - because it lacks allies . 
  i do think that we 're not really neutral in the strict sense of the word anymore though . 
  at least if the eu army idea gets of the ground we 'll have to have a meaningful domestic debate about ` neutrality ' , and what it means . 
  i know it 's just a joke  . 
  i however was completely serious in my original comment . 
  who is to say , at this point in time , that the use of the weapon was not condoned by the government of afghanistan ? 
  there 's basically no info , so i have no opinion . 
  i 've never heard of a case where someone wants to be sent to prison . 
  the truck attack in sweden would also not be an example of this because , if i recall correctly , he tried to flee and was just caught because some people in a gas station ( or somewhere like that ) thought he acted suspicious and called the cops . 
  which indicates he did n't want to go to prison . 
  most everyone also understands dutch , even if they themselves do n't realise/mention it . 
  although i 'm not sure if it counts as a * real * language ... 
   ( ... ) it is even better paid than military service ... ... something i would n't exactly call an achievement . 
  the pay for conscripted soldiers is a joke , more akin to an ` allowance ' . 
  i 'm aware of that . 
  i believe on issues relating to non proliferation of nuclear weapons , the chemical weapons convention or even the threats of climate change , the security council could find common ground in many cases . 
  the facts that build the basis of every decision must come from an independent/multilateral investigation . 
  however - regime change because it is disliked , uncooperative or accused of heinous crimes should n't be imposed from outside , and this is also where the security council will * never * find common ground . 
  what goals would be achieved by that ? 
  'em otional satisfaction ' ? 
  this would probably cause another global recession ... so i 'm not voting for doing that . 
  whatever reputation the us might have had left for ` being the good guys ' or for ` having genuinely good intentions ' died during the bush presidency . 
  at least for me . 
  if the international community has to act it should be done through the un and predominantly via sanctions . 
  in vienna we still play tarock . 
  we know ' [ k\u00f6nigrufen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%b6nigrufen ) ' ( = calling the king ) und ' [ zwanzgerrufen ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwanzigerrufen ) ' ( = calling twenty , link is from the german wiki , sorry ) which is an easier variant played with less cards . 
  also the tarock cards get cool names like ` gstie\u00df ' , ` der oide ' or ` glatze ' . 
  what did denmark do ? 
  sounds like russian , minus the vodka . 
  if you just told me to guess at the language i 'd probably say it is russian . 
  but it sounds harsher and the words are much clearer . 
  i really suck at languages though , so do n't take me too seriously . 
   absolut vodka well that 's a surprise . 
  i feel silly now for assuming all vodka comes out of russia . 
   what do you think has changed to render firearms `` of little sense '' in a modern society ? 
  he did n't write that though - he said that the 2nd amendment makes little to no sense . 
  i think that if we were to begin a discussion we should n't start it on the wrong foot . 
   the bill of rights is the first ten amendments to the united states constitution . 
  i always thought ` bill of rights ' was a colloquialism for the us constitution . 
  goes to show how little i really know about the usa . 
  i do n't think it 's very common for a regular citizen to directly get in contact with an elected official . 
  could only see this happen with a smallish town and its mayor . 
  [ palatschinke ] ( http://amuseinmykitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/polichinkacloseup.jpg ) vs. [ pancake ] ( https://images-gmi-pmc.edge-generalmills.com/be4bf529-efc6-4cde-8a4f-1be8151a8fe1.jpg ), 
  if i get pancakes after ordering palatschinken i 'm gon na complain too . 
  i 'm not a football bloke , but my friends tell me it 's because they have huge amounts of money and buy the best players from the other teams . 
  also it 's because they are very successful so naturally they are more hated by rivals than if they were just a mediocre team that 's easy to beat . 
  i there a checklist to find out ? 
  generally it 's not allowed but there are some circumstances that permit it . 
  also if you become naturalised you have to do the following : * renunciation of foreign citizenship ( under the law of the applicant 's home country ) unless this is impractical there was a recent controversy about naturalised turkish immigrants who would reapply for the turkish citizenship after being granted the austrian one , without informing the austrian state of course , since this would mean they lose austrian citizenship immediately . 
  apparently the turkish state * encouraged * this by actually advising those immigrants to do exactly that - and also they refuse to inform us if an austrian citizen applies for turkish citizenship . 
  it turned out the department of defense knew that something fishy was going on for years , because the children of these `` illegal dual citizens '' would call to get a written confirmation of having served their mandatory time in the austrian army - to escape serving mandatory time in the turkish one , because , you guessed it , many austro-turks would also let their children apply for turkish citizenship . 
  they should lose the austrian one according to law , mind you . 
  the department of defense informed the interior ministry of its suspicions and they did nothing . 
  why ? 
  no clue . 
  this was some weeks ago and it all died down now . 
  the interior ministry warned about a `` witch hunt '' when some suggested that maybe we should find out who wanted the turkish citizenry so bad that they went behind the austrian states back to get it - so that we could revoke the austrian citizenship from them . 
  i am not aware of how they plan to proceed . 
  so here 's what i feel about this : if you are austrian you ca n't be ( under normal circumstances ) a citizen of another state . 
  we should all be in the same boat . 
  i think it 's possible the syrian plane hit a rebel munitions depot with a conventional bomb and the depot contained chemical weapons - thus triggering their release . 
  of course it 's also possible the plane itself dropped the chemical weapon , but i have to wonder why assad would authorize such use of chemicals because as far as i know he is currently winning against the rebels , and angering the international community does n't seem like a smart move . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/austria/comments/2su77v/traveling_in_austria_part_i_what_to_see_in_vienna/ ) are some recommendations for vienna from / r/austria . the individual country subreddits could probably give you some more recommendations . 
  i 'd recommend walking along the [ `` ring '' ] ( https://www.google.at/maps/dir/schottentor,+1010+wien/48.2066137,16.3600849/48.2014798,16.3736863/48.2088876,16.3823981/@48.2081173,16.3719622,15z/data=!4m11!4m10!1m5!1m1!1s0x476d07bdb40fc305:0x195b7318ef0b97ff!2m2!1d16.3622875!2d48.2137253!1m0!1m0!1m0!3e2 ) in the first district , branching off when you see something you like to check out , like so : ( i pretty much stole another comment from a `` deleted '' user for this ) starting at [ subway station `` schottentor '' ] ( https://www.google.at/maps/place/schottentor/@48.2134804,16.3600582,16.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x476d07bdb40fc305:0x195b7318ef0b97ff!8m2!3d48.2137253!4d16.3622875 ) , walking up to vienna university you will see the votivkirche . 
  you then walk past the university to see the rathaus ( town 's hall ) , then you just keep walking along the ring ( i.e. 
  universit\u00e4tsring , i.e. 
  dr.-karl-renner-ring , i.e. 
  [ walking straight on after staatsoper will take you to schwarzenbergplatz and stadtgarten , etc.

  and it 's really quite cool . 
  i 'd say the nfl is gaining popularity here in austria , but it 's still nowhere compared to soccer . 
  and by god , those commercials every couple of minutes - sometimes i just ca n't deal with them and stop watching . 
  i know you can get accustomed to a lot of things but i do n't think i could watch any sort of program regularly that is being interrupted like the nfl is . 
  just a heads up : if you do n't speak french and have never been a part of french culture , do n't tell people you * are * ` french ' because of your heritage . 
  i do n't mean this in an insulting fashion - it 's just that in my experience that does n't go over too well , especially as a way to introduce yourself . 
  i believe the word ` affect ' is not correct to use here , it should be ` effect ' . 
  sorry i ca n't help you and write this only to nitpick ... that 's the internet for you eh ? 
  i 'd say fc bayern m\u00fcnchen is is pretty widely hated in austria . 
  maybe south korea or japan , but honestly i do n't know much about their general attitudes or how their governments operate . 
  so this is a tough one . 
  but as a rule of thumb i 'd say the ` wealthier ' and more stable the country in question the more ` welcome ' it would be . 
  well if you 've got some more specifics like genre or in what setting you want to play this music , let us know , but here are some songs from austria : ( from ` relatively recent ' to ` ancient ' ) * [ pizzera & jaus - eine ins leben ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m6lyaranrq ) * [ seiler und speer - ham kummst ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwgistpkcdk ) * [ hmbc - vo mello bis ge schoppornou ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmi2m06yffc ) * [ hubert von goisern - brenna tuats guat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-xybjoknmg ) * [ falco - rock me amadeus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvikz8oe_xa ) * [ falco - der kommissar ] ( https://vimeo.com/204755098 ) * [ rainhard fendrich - i am from austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmsa_xb2h5u ) < - ** this one ** is our ` unofficial ' national anthem because it is universally adored by austrians . 
  if you play it to an austrian that 's far abroad he might cry . 
  but it 's maybe a bit slow and definitely not a ` party ' song , or at least not till the end of the party when almost everyone is gone . 
  here are the [ lyrics in english ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/i-am-austria-i-am-austria.html ) if someone is curious . 
  * [ s.t.s - gro\u00dfvater ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6muwrzaygu ) * [ s.t.s - f\u00fcrstenfeld ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fprmp0xuvca ) * [ wolfgang ambros - da hofa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjex5tyokwm ) edit : i remembered another one that 's not really a song but part of a cabaret from josef hader , one of my favourites : [ josef hader - so ist das leben ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeb96x6qf7c ), 
  what makes your sheep the ` best ' ? 
  and why is the plural of ` sheep ' not ` sheeps ' ? 
  but germany was really great at losing them . 
  i mean look at them today , worked out nicely . 
  public broadcasting channel on ` tv ' ( via streaming service though ) and internet . 
  in which subreddit did you read it , do you remember ? 
  i honestly have no clue how i would react if someone would say something like that to me in earnest . 
  that 's pretty bad .
