  you make it sound like we realise that those words are ridiculous but we consciously choose to use them because we speak german . 
  you must understand that this is not how it works or feels for native german speakers . 
  even ' [ donaudampfschifffahrtskapit\u00e4n ] ( https://translate.google.com/#de/en/donaudampfschifffahrtskapit%c3%a4n ) ' does n't really sound that weird to me - because it is a thing that really exists . 
  i mean that the whole ` term ' registers to me not like a stuck together lego-word , but it means something very specific . 
  it just means that one specific thing . 
  that the words donau and dampf and so forth all have their own meanings does n't really register that much when they get stuck together like this . 
  i 'm really shit at grammar so a linguistic explanation is not something i can provide , that was more about how those words ` feel ' to me . 
  counterquestion : why ca n't i call ` schadenfreude ' harmdelight ? 
  if it is just because `` there is no such word '' then maybe the german stick-words-together scheme would be a nifty rule for you guys to get past the pedantic dictionary guardians . 
  maybe you guys should adapt it as well ? 
  things that would spring to my mind are : quality of life - more ` pain free ' days for men than for woman because of biological differences , and that the current generation of soon-to-be retirees had a more stricter career/family divide between genders which had a negative impact on woman careers resulting in practically no job opportunities for most of them in their later live - so either they are allowed to retire early , or they need financial aid from the state because they have poor chances for a job . 
  retraining them does n't make much sense either because the payoff just is n't there with only a couple of years working life left . 
  edit : i just want to say that it might well make sense to equalize retirement age sometime . 
  ( or now . 
  it 's not really something i think a lot about ), 
  i do n't want to enter an argument about retirement ages at this time . 
  maybe someone else will entertain you . 
  i 'd say this fact should surely be a * part * of the argument about when retirement occurs for men/woman . 
  but the discussion does not end with only that one fact . 
  i did n't mean to portray austrian rule as mostly benevolent or whitewash anything . 
  i just thought ` colony ' means something different : that you claim a plot of land that was ` uninhabited ' before ( at least you claim it as uninhabited ) and then have colonists settle it - in the vain that england colonised parts of north america , or spain colonized parts of south america . 
  imagine you and your friends want to order a pizza , but you all have to agree on the kind , and if only one objects he can stop the pizza-ordering-process for everybody - so no lunch for all of you . 
  but you guys are friends and usually some dialog and concessions in other areas can bring consensus on the pizza issue . 
  but then one of you goes through a ` weird ' phase and communication brakes down - you just ca n't agree anymore and you 're no longer willing to pay with concessions in other things to ` get ' his vote . 
  how long would you go without pizza before you 'd propose changes to this unanimity rule ? 
  the first one will probably seem unreal and maybe i would have that weird ` this ca n't be real , out-of-body , confused ' - feeling . 
  or maybe adrenalin would kick in and i 'd just deal with it - i do n't know . 
  i 'd imagine that after a couple you 'd get used to them though . 
  i know it 's just a joke but i want to clarify anyway . 
  our neighbours never were ` colonies ' . 
  as far as i know we only tried the ` colony thing ' one time in ~ 1780 for a couple years on this tiny [ group of islands ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/nicobar_islands.png ) - because every empire at the time did it and we wanted to be part of the club - but after a couple of years the colonists left or something and that was pretty much it . 
  for me the fundamental idea was always more about ` equity ' than true ` equality ' . 
  given some of the biological differences and varying challenges these entail ( especially medical expenses and pregnancy ) i am of the opinion that some things must be handled unequal for different genders . 
  it 's an ongoing process though and i suspect we will never be ` finished ' - there 'll always be a need for discourse and tweaking . 
  come on , he is n't hurting anyone . 
  for me it 's [ hader privat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2br4-aum-ze&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1802 ) ( german only , sry ) by [ josef hader ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_hader ) . 
  he also made a couple of good movies . 
  that 's not ` it ' though . 
  the child has to do an exam at the end of every school year , which is taken in a public school , to show it has reached the goals of the state curriculum . 
  this is to ensure the child 's education is at least equivalent to the one it would get in public schools .

  honestly i do n't even dislike germany - actually i think they 're pretty cool - but cheering against germany in sports is just something we do here . 
  [ czechia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/flag_of_the_czech_republic.svg/255px-flag_of_the_czech_republic.svg.png ) is probably my favourite , though i also quite like the [ scottish ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/flag_of_scotland.svg/1280px-flag_of_scotland.svg.png ) one . 
  i must say [ estonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8f/flag_of_estonia.svg/255px-flag_of_estonia.svg.png ) also got their colours right . 
  the black separating the lighter colours looks really cool . 
  outside europe i think [ japan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9e/flag_of_japan.svg/1280px-flag_of_japan.svg.png ) takes the top spot . 
  i want to live in the timeline where the ex-soviet states in the 90s get a helping hand and become prosperous . 
  a great opportunity for mankind missed . 
  i 'd say i trust the judiciary a lot more than the government . 
  the problem with the government is that it 's made up of politicians . 
  i made `` chicken curry '' to last a few days . 
  i used peaches , pineapple , chicken , cream , curry powder and various other spices . 
  those were all read to me : [ der regenbogenfisch ] ( https://www.amazon.de/regenbogenfisch-marcus-pfister/dp/3314103190/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=utf8&amp;psc=1&amp;refrid=yreaekqs68yyv8e39qhp ) ( ~ the rainbowfish ) [ die geggis ] ( https://www.amazon.de/die-geggis-mira-lobe/dp/3702655840/ref=pd_sim_14_5?_encoding=utf8&amp;psc=1&amp;refrid=ctmb6h8szysm33hpqrtj ) ( ~ the geggis ) [ die kleine raupe nimmersatt ] ( https://www.amazon.de/kleine-raupe-nimmersatt-eric-carle/dp/3836940345 ) ( ~ the small insatiable caterpillar ) [ das kleine ich bin ich ] ( https://www.amazon.de/das-kleine-ich-bin-ich/dp/370264850x ) ( ~ the little i-am-self ) [ he duda ] ( https://www.amazon.de/duda-vierfarbiges-pappbilderbuch-jon-blake/dp/3407793804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1490384616&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=he+duda ) ( ~ hey you-there ) various dr. seuss books, 
  you are of course free to set your priorities how you like . 
  but still i think the various social systems ( state benefits for kids , healthcare ) would serve as a better benchmark . 
  or there are a lot of other things that spring to mind , like corruption or civil liberties . 
  homeschooling would just never cross my mind , that 's why i was astonished . 
  probably turkey because of the current developments , and also i 'm not a fan of religion in my live and i think this would be hard to ignore there . 
  ( but i 'm not sure about how hard it really would be ) runner up would be russia ... and third place would probably go to poland , again because of the religion thing ( but also because some of the politicians there are ludicrous ) ... though i think apart from that i would probably be okay with it , i like the friends i have that come from there . 
  that 's the one overriding factor for living in a country for you ? 
  homeschooling ? 
  just a quick reminder of what some eu institutions are : ( if i write something that 's wrong , please correct me ) * ** eu parliament ** : pretty close to a national parliament , i.e a few hundred elected representatives which agree on a `` eu government '' ( = commission ) and also have to sign off on * almost anything that touches anything to do with laws , or has lasting effects on the eu * . 
  they are elected by the citizens of the eu member states in an election every couple of years . 
  * ** commission ** : ~ 30 person strong , this is an analog to a government consisting of , basically , ministers for the various fields and a prime minister-analog . 
  those people are chosen by the eu parliament , whose parties make it clear who they would like in the commission during parliament elections . 
  ( of course they need enough votes to get what they want ) the commission can * propose * things like laws . 
  ( others have to agree on them though ) * ** council of the eu ** : high national officials ( often heads of government , e.g. 
  chancellor or prime minister ) of the various member states ( who have therefore succeeded in * national * elections ) . 
  since there are 28 eu members there are 28 people in here because everyone gets to send one . 
  the ` coucil of the eu ' can introduce amendments for laws the commission has proposed and ** has to agree on a law together with parliament ** for laws to go into effect . 
  you have now a basic understanding of eu institutions . 
  this next part should give you a brief overview of the decision process in practice , and who gets consulted by default : ( it 's not very long ) [ -  `` how eu decisions are made '' ] ( https://europa.eu/european-union/eu-law/decision-making/procedures_en ) i hope that after reading this ( and verifying the information i have given thus far by another source with integrity of your own choosing ) you would now agree that the decision making process is sound ( not perfect maybe , but surely serviceable ) and that the people who make decisions in the eu are democratically elected and represent the citizens of the eu member states fairly . 
  now , i want to remind you that in the `` how eu decisions are made '' explanation you can see how often law proposals are bounced around and that there is ample time ( and political will , we want everyone to be happy ) to change law proposals into something everyone is happy with . 
  but - ** yes ** - it is true that it can happen that france is overruled concerning a law in * both * the council * and * the eu parliament . 
  ( remember those two institutions are involved in approving a law and both must agree for one to pass ) which would mean that france did n't find enough support from other heads of government in the council , and neither did it garner enough votes in parliament - presumably because other people thought that this was a good idea . 
  so yes , if other eu members hold - with a healthy majority - a different opinion , and they * accept the political damage * that will be incurred by eu institutions if you do n't have the minority have its way ( because they wo n't be quiet about this for sure , and at this stage a compromise would have been sought for for many months ) then ** france would have to go along with a eu decision it did n't want . 
  ** at least if it is obligated under eu law to do so , which in such a severe disagreement could take months ( or longer ) to settle in court . 
  ( it is agreed upon , now in advance , which kind of laws eu member states have to accept to be shaped by the eu institutions and what is to be left alone - france could try to argue in court that the eu did n't have permission for the law in question , or maybe it would use some other legal mumbo jumbo - you know how lawyers are ... ) on to other shores . 
  the ` influence by big company ' concern is also a valid one , and we should always be on the lookout for this kind of stuff . 
  i think i 'll let maybe someone else tackle it since it 's rather late and i already wrote quite a bit ... basically ` ich hab keine lust ' ... at least not right now ... maybe i 'll just write my opinion without explanation , so : i think the eu deals with corporations better than single nations ever could simply because of its influence . 
  it can make demands from them which no one , * single * country in europe could make , and i think the efforts to combat corruption are quite good ( of course better is always possible and we should push for more ) and the eu , as it works today , is doing a good job in this regard . 
  hope this helps and if you got questions just ask , i do n't know everything though i 'm still learning about this all myself - turns out 28 countries working together can get quite complex , who would have thought ... edit : formatting . 
  edit2 : i called a prime minister a ` head of state ' , they are ` head of goverment ' of course . 
  you mean by laws and law enforcement , or regular people ? 
  regular people seem to be fine with it . 
  it certainly is n't perceived as bad as stealing physical goods . 
  roughly in ascending order of importance : build a public broadcasting service that provides information and a broad picture to current ongoings in the usa , primarily focused on domestic policy . 
  it should n't recommend any solutions to problems but just inform on what 's going on . 
  this would be funded with federal money . 
  make it harder to buy your politicians . 
  in short get private money out of politics and instead fund political parties with state or federal money , small individual donations would also be acceptable . 
  corporations are not people - i realise this may be more of a ` law ' term but some outgrowths of this are just crazy . 
  draw up harsher corruption penalties ( and/or widen the scope of the current law ) so the severe cases actually have to go to prison for some years . 
  make it realistic for small , newly founded parties to gain seats in congress/senate . 
  the goal is to have a diverse political spectrum where the more fringe ideas actually only get the numbers of votes they deserve - this is possible because voters can choose and disregard parties they find too extreme , and can be sure to get representation even with smaller parties . 
  of course i 'm not talking about having 25 disjointed parties who ca n't form a government - there is a happy compromise to be found concerning numbers/thresholds . 
  i also feel your education system needs a good deal of attention and may actually be one of the underlying root causes of current problems but i do n't think i know enough to comment on it - let alone recommend what should be done . 
  man , i wish we had germany 's problems when it comes to politics . 
  ( errr ... current ones only . 
  fuck the past ones . ),
