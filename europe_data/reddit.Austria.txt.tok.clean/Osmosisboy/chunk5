  well , australia is exactly the opposite of austria : full of friendly people and the wildlife is trying to kill ` ya . 
  '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' `` leader of the free world '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' - there , that needed some more quotes . 
  i assume he [ likes the spotlight ] ( https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab66fff6a0199a4bd745a360901077b33d2d9f86/0_124_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=1920&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=12f08154ff391a5560f4cf6409fcee1d ) and his high public profile opens some doors . 
  he is n't meeting anyone in an official capacity though ( afaik ) . 
  farage is still a member of the * european * parliament . 
   the first suspect had applied for permanent residency in 2014 , but this was rejected , and in december 2016 he was given four weeks to leave the country , police chief jonas hysing told a press conference . 
  the suspect then disappeared , and police began searching for him , mr hysing added . 
  we are trying to diversify , to build a more robust economy in case of another financial crisis . 
   `` we reaffirm to marine le pen as to all the other candidates in the french presidential election that corsica is not a simple french region but a free nation that will be reborn , that the corsican people are an irrefutable historical reality that can not be blended with the french people . '' i get the feeling this was n't about le pen per se , but a more general protest ( i think the way the protesters conducted themselves was way out of line however ) . 
  i had n't been aware of a kind of ` independence ' movement on corsica before this - anyone know how legitimate they are , and how much they represent corsican sentiment ? 
  i do n't think there 's anything to argue  . 
  nice work !, 
  the colours in this photograph look very ` enhanced ' . 
  what do you mean with reprisals ? 
  the eta disarmed on its own volition , they told them where to find the weapons . 
  how significant is this really ? 
  seems quite trivial to me . 
  seems like a question for / r/askeurope / , maybe someone there can help . 
  ten times a year . 
  i think so , but i guess it 's possible i missed one with all the junk mail they always jam into my mailbox . 
  hah , i wanted to fool you with a made up fact , but turns out that now that i succeded , i have no clue as to how to proceed . 
  no it is not . 
  marble was much softer back then - it has hardened considerably in the last centuries and today is as hard as granite . 
   on the final orbit , cassini will plunge into saturn 's atmosphere , sending back new and unique science to the very end . 
  after losing contact with earth , the spacecraft will burn up like a meteor , becoming part of the planet itself . 
  that 's bloody outrageous !, 
  i want to complain . 
  i listened to [ ` the girl with all the gifts ' ] ( https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17235026-the-girl-with-all-the-gifts?from_search=true ) as an audiobook , and it was pretty good . 
  i 'd recommend it if anyone is looking for something . 
  is there anything you guys listened/read recently and enjoyed ? 
  edit : added the link . 
  no it is n't . 
  i subscribed on 07.12.2016 ... so it took a while . 
  today my [ research * eu ] ( http://cordis.europa.eu/research-eu/home_en.html ) magazine arrived . 
  that 's the one the eu lets you subscribe to free of charge . 
  it 's pretty cool . 
  maybe it 's just myself but i think i 've heard enough opinions about brexit by now . 
  people are just repeating things to the nth power . 
  i 'll be glad when the negotiations start rolling and there 's finally something interesting and definite for journalists to write about - and i 'll be even gladder when we can return to some semblance of normality in a couple of years . 
   biofuel can help solve the co2-issue . 
  is a much contended claim . 
  there are credible studies which suggest that through ' [ indirect land use change impacts of biofuels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indirect_land_use_change_impacts_of_biofuels ) ' - which encompasses the following effect :  as farmers worldwide respond to higher crop prices in order to maintain the global food supply-and-demand balance , pristine lands are cleared to replace the food crops that were diverted elsewhere to biofuels ' production . 
  because natural lands , such as rainforests and grasslands , store carbon in their soil and biomass as plants grow each year , clearance of wilderness for new farms translates to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions . 
  - the carbon emissions of both corn and cellulosic ethanol could in practice be 93 and 50 percent respectively * higher * than those of gasoline . 
  ( this may be a ` worst case ' type of calculation though ) but the consensus in the scientific community at the moment seems to be that ` life cycle ' carbon emissions of bio fuels are hard to calculate with great certainty - which means we are actually not sure at all if it is environmentally friendly . 
  some interesting wikipedia pages : * [ environmental impact of biodiesel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/environmental_impact_of_biodiesel ) * [ issues relating to biofuels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/issues_relating_to_biofuels ), 
  that headline does n't make much sense to me - even after reading the article . 
  ... oh wait i just got it . 
  it 's meant to imply germany is leaving the uk ... i think ... nah that seems also a bit off . 
  [ the austrian eagle has already lost its plumes . ], 
  haha , nice one ... now gib trieste pls . 
  sadly the translation ( taken from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_der_berge,_land_am_strome#lyrics ) ) does n't rhyme anymore so this kinda sucks . 
  also the compound words are stupid to translate . 
  but here it is :  strongly feuded for , fiercely hard-fought for ,  you lie in the middle of the continent  like a strong heart ,  since the early days of the ancestors thou hast  borne the burden of a high mission ,  much-tried austria ,  much-tried austria . 
  i especially like the heart analogy . 
  okay , but please do not rush it . 
  take the time needed to talk everything through . 
  got ta rule 'em all - * a heart so true ... * * ... our courage will pull us through ... *, 
  but it 's our destiny . 
  if you call something stupid you should at least try to provide an argument for why it is so . 
  it does n't sound like `` tat\u00dc-tata , tat\u00dc-tata '' at all , i will never understand . 
  here 's hungary , romania and austria : [ http://i.imgur.com/fjwmmjs.jpg] ( http://i.imgur.com/fjwmmjs.jpg ) edit : / u/agenttud there 's only one pixel row difference between our images . 
  hey that 's a really nice design . 
  is it stock or specially made for linz ? 
  after reading that article i have no idea what 's actually going on . 
  amazing job by the journalist . 
  how did that radio tower ever get approved ? 
  that maut thing gets a lot of headlines down here - there 's probably going to be some angry back and forth over this . 
  brace yourselves elections are coming . 
  quick , build ports everywhere . 
  finally austria can into sea . 
  god damnit you took \u00d6sterreich again . 
  [ those bastards = / ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=280&amp;y=850 ) maybe [ this ] ( https://s17.postimg.org/ix6m8u3bj/new_text_document_2.jpg ) would help calm things down ? 
  i wish we could build an eu flag between them , but sadly we do n't have the numbers . 
  [ this is hilarious right now . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/place/#x=280&amp;y=850 ), 
  or is it the epitome of a project built on rationality and little emotion ? 
  the scene with cameron and the steering wheel is glorious !, 
  i ca n't believe how well all of this is made .

  [ wikipedia -  democracy variants -  republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy#republic )  the term republic has many different meanings , but today often refers to a ** representative democracy ** with an elected head of state , such as ( ... ) also  the founding fathers of the united states rarely praised and often criticised democracy , which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy , ( ... ) edit : also this may be where the confusion comes from :  in american english , the definition of a republic can also refer specifically to a government in which elected individuals represent the citizen body , * known elsewhere as a representative democracy * ( a democratic republic ), 
   leaked european parliament resolution this is not an `` eu response '' - at least not an official one . 
  but the text is quite interesting . 
  * awww * , i love you too random eu-citizen . 
  oh wow , i had no idea the relationship to poland had deteriorated * that * much . 
  i wonder how often this sentiment would in essence be shared by europeans regarding the uk . 
  what gave you the impression it was meant as a joke ? 
  i think he 's expressing an honest opinion of his . 
  you really should state with an `` edit : ... '' what you changed . 
  it 's just proper etiquette for one . 
   leave them on winter time no please , leave it on summer time . 
  the original plan was cool , shame it turned out too expensive . 
  this one however is more on the lackluster side of things . 
  maybe in the future we should count our chickens before ... ( err how does this metaphor work again ? 
  ) ... anyway - maybe we could think it through to the end before making plans known . 
  anyone know what kind of numbers are in play here ? 
  by how much would you increase the crop yield for a given area if you use gm crops , or how much does the need for pesticides decrease ( and with that the costs ) - in short how much , if at all , is either side ( nongm/gm ) favored by economics ?
