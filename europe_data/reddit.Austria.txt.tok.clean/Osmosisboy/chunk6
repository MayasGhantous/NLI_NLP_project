  * * puh , thank god . 
  war is just shit . 
  what 's georgia so happy about ? 
  imagine the following : you take part in the crusades when after a battle the white garment you are wearing is bright red with the blood of the enemy , you then take off your swordbelt - which leaves a broad white line separating the red . 
  for the valour you have shown in battle , these colours - `` red-white-red '' - are the colours of your new coat of arms granted by the king . 
  your dynasty plays an important part in the history of a country called austria and those colours endure centuries . 
  & nbsp ; of course this is probably a lie . 
  but as lies go its a nice one . 
  edit : this is also a situation where using red twice is perfectly acceptable . 
  jesus people , it 's obviously a joke . 
  stop downvoting the poor fucker - considering where he comes from he 's already low enough . 
  can i get one too , then ? 
  pretty please ? 
  but that 's only 0.00968 ... % of the russian population . 
  many russians were n't jailed , that 's the real story here . 
  for those wondering why there are protests i heard the main reason is rampant corruption , possibly brought to the forefront by [ this video uncovering specific cases of corruption ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_gf9g ) , naming some persons responsible for this , most notably current prime minister medvedev . 
  the person talking in this video ( russian opposition leader alexei navalny ) has since been detained and [ had a hearing in court today ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/27/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-at-court-following-arrest ) . 
  if this is wrong please correct me . 
  it 's not so easy to get information about this stuff if you ca n't speak russian . 
   they 're far left , crypto-pro-brexit . 
  they 're what now ? 
  i ca n't decode that . 
  hah , well you sure shut me up good . 
  but there are so many colours , why use ` red ' twice ? 
  but this does n't look like a shoe sole at all ... = /, 
  you 'll have to talk louder , you 're so far down i ca n't hear you from up here . 
  i 'm sorry to be the one to break the news but ... dutch is n't a * real * language . 
  it 's actually fake . 
  i get that it was n't all that funny but i meant it just as a joke . 
  i 'd expect engineers to build a transport vehicle that wo n't easily explode . 
  but i refuse to end every sentence that 's not serious with an '' / s '' . 
  i hope people are smart enough to just figure it out . 
  ... '' - the onion ? 
  man , german must suck to learn . 
  though probably every language has its pitfalls . 
  what is it called ? 
  `` hindenburg on rails '' ? 
  i hate it when they chop up an interview to the degree where you only get tiny morsels on a plate , arranged in a way the ` journalist ' finds most appetizing . 
  i hate it so much in fact that i followed the source , watched the video and spent 30 minutes on a sunday translating a part of it into english . 
  yes , i 'm a moron . 
  here is a bit more of what she said :( [ source ] ( http://www.daserste.de/information/politik-weltgeschehen/europamagazin/sendung/angela-merkel-interview-rom-100.html ) ) * interviewer : ( this question abbreviated by me ) presents the currently a bit harsher political climate ( at least perceived as such from the outside ) to eastern europe , names migration distribution with hungary as an example , states poland with issues with due process and freedom of opinion as an example . 
  asks merkel if it would make sense to use eu aid money as a bargaining chip to exert pressure , if those problems persist or even deepen . 
  * ** merkel : i think we have to have profound talks with those countries . 
  and the commission is already in the process of doing that . 
  and also the eu members will have to say something pertaining developments that are worrisome . 
  just counting these issues up against money i find not very good and also i do n't want to threaten - ** * interviewer interjects : why ? 
  * ** merkel : well i do n't like threats and ` due process ' and ` freedom of opinion ' are inherent values as such , and really these are requirements to be a member of the european union , and that 's why we talk with turkey about them in their negotiations , and so we will have to talk with poland about those things if there are assessments that say that those questions are not completely and transparently enough answered yet . 
  ** * interviewer : that means you do n't want to , under any circumstances , use eu aid money as a threat ? 
  * ** merkel : ( seems bemused by the question ) today in this interview i do n't want to articulate any threats . 
  i want to see to it that ` due process ' , as we understand it , is observed everywhere in europe ** edit : deleted some commas . 
  must be an old map , our current unemployment numbers are n't something to be super proud of at the moment - especially since they 've been steadily going up for the [ last couple of years . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/austria/unemployment-rate ), 
  could you at least read the first sentence of the article ? 
   the payment is only available to the first 1,000 people who register their interest and ** who have already filed an asylum application **, 
  so in 40 years time they will trigger article 50 again ? 
  if you 've got anything meaningful to contribute , i 'm willing to listen . 
  for example how you would define ` undemocratic ' . 
  how is it undemocratic ? 
  our elected officials are implementing it and there are n't major demonstrations ( i doubt there are even * any demonstrations * ) in the street against it . 
  if your problem is foreign politicians injecting their agendas into your population than this * is * a part of how to solve it . 
  also `` free speech '' is n't such a knockout argument in austria as it is elsewhere , e.g. 
  the ` verbotsgesetz ' which ( among other things ) aims to suppress any potential revival of nazism - which in practice means you are not allowed to run through the streets while shouting `` heil hitler ! '', 
  and using the nazi salute to greet everyone . 
  the police will take you in and you ( almost certainly ) will , at least , be fined . 
  i 'm not exactly a fan either ... but information of wrongdoing should still be taken seriously and being followed up on . 
  the source being a bit shit does n't mean we should absolutely disregard everything - we just should n't take anything at face value . 
  i hope this gets cleared up satisfactorily , so that there remain no doubts about what happened . 
  also if they find someone has taken money i hope they go to jail . 
  fines or probation is * not * enough . 
  show everyone what taking that money means - being locked up for a number of years . 
  ( or show them that they get away with a fine and a minor scandal ... whatever you prefer ), 
   `` when a body loses its sense of direction and is no longer able to look ahead , it experiences a regression and , in the long run , risks dying , '' francis told the leaders gathered in an ornate , frescoed chamber in the heart of the vatican . 
  there is something dripping from this quote but i ca n't tell what it is . 
  yes , but australia was just a mix up from the mods . 
  ^ ^ actually i think we seldom use him because he looks a bit mean ( or ridiculous if it 's a bad design ) , and also the display of national symbols is generally more on the sparse side here . 
  we do n't like to overdo it . 
  when we call a pretty big area `` weinviertel '' ( ~ winedistrict ) you know we mean business . 
  i do n't know what to make of this ... at least they realised that cats are an integral part of the internet . 
  ca n't they reach mayors ... i do n't know ... by phone ? 
  and tell them about broadband infrastructure ? 
  if it were a ketchup joke he would use the word ` ketchup ' or the joke would get too obscure - since the viewer ca n't distinguish if it 's ketchup or tomato sauce on the box . 
  i think the situation is : he honestly believes it is tomato sauce and is baffled by this , but the viewer makes the blood -  italian mafia connection . 
  ( and is amused by this and the baffled italyball ) see how well we german speakers understand humour ? 
  and you guys think we 're boring ... 
  a swamp german talking about mountains ... hilarious . 
  honestly i 'd prefer the german way . 
  if i 'm on a homepage trying to get some information i always have to check first if this is even a legit one because the logo alone lets me think this could be some corporation website . 
  a prediction of the future is never a verifiable fact itself , mostly it is an * opinion * based on facts . 
   [ a fact is something that has occurred or is correct . 
  the usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability -- that is , whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fact ) so even if two sides of a discussion agree on the facts , the way they weigh those against each other and ultimately their opinion can obviously differ . 
  if you think that , you need to visit czechia or some of our other neighbours . 
  our beer is drinkable and we have some good stuff peppered in between the bland , but they are basically drowning in a sea of bliss over there . 
  touch\u00e9, 
  their wein sucks so we are clearly in the right here . 
  erm , excuse me ? 
  where 's our word ? 
  norway and sweden use the same but each got their own on the map . 
  maybe we say vino , did you think about that ?
