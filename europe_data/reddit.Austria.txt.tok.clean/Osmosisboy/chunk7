  i mean it 's true we have * some * things in common with germany ... but do you see that state line between our countries ? 
  that means we get our own fucking word !, 
  ps : we say ` wein ' in austria btw . 
  yeah , they must be close to giving up their claim that dutch is a real language . 
  all good points . 
  i searched briefly but did n't find anything about the ` strasbourg veto ' . 
  what is it ? 
  i do n't mean to insult anyone but i would prefer a country where [ corruption ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index#2016 ) is less prevalent . 
  of course it could be that having strict anti-corruption requirements to fulfill ( which would presumably come with this eu agency ) could actually improve the overall situation in romania - so if there is initial eu oversight and a lasting commitment from a romanian government we can trust , i could get behind the idea . 
  he was just filling in those murky details . 
  i 'm looking at a single source here . 
  you know that hungary and poland were alright examples but there are persons who do n't know about them beforehand . 
  how would they know which piece of information to trust ? 
  they 'd have to now check every new fact they come across because trust has eroded , which means the whole thing is discredited . 
  if you look at this differently than me , then that is fine by me . 
  i do n't want to argue semantics . 
  it casts every information he offers in doubt and thus discredits his entire comment . 
  the thinking goes : `` if he is wrong about this , what else is he wrong about ? '', 
  words matter , yes . 
  but a shouting match wo n't have a happy ending . 
  i 'd much prefer us to remain calm , unemotional and rational about this , and to not stir up * our own population * - this would be a door that once it 's open , you ca n't close easily . 
  i do n't want to seem petty but [ austria has taken a more than fair share of refugees ] ( http://www.compareyourcountry.org/migration?cr=oecd&amp;lg=en&amp;page=0&amp;visited=1 ) ( order it per share of population ) currently . 
  and while it 's true that the whole situation is unfair to especially italy and greece , austria was at the beginning very much in favor of a eu plan to distribute refugees to all member states . 
  it 's just that such a plan was n't really accepted or implemented ( really it was blocked by some countries ) so that now we have to be harsher or be one of the few countries refugees eventually wind up in . 
  the talk is unfriendly and sometimes outright hostile but it 's actions that truly matter . 
  if he takes actions to outright hurt eu interests ( and not just talks about it ) we 'll see harsher responses than currently . 
  sure , but still this seems absurd . 
  shame the article is so sparse on information . 
  you need to cross the ` one third ' threshold though to trigger the system and it 's not evident to me how the legislative branch of one country should be able to convince so many others to play its ` blame game ' with the eu . 
  it 's also only meant to be used in cases where the ` principle of subsidiarity ' has been violated so you 'd need a convincing argument why this is such a case . 
  i do think this system is a bit weird though and it 's always a good idea to consider the possible abuse of such a thing . 
  i wonder why they even bothered to implement this , your point about bureaucracy is a good one . 
  sometimes i 'd really like to talk directly to the people in power and get their side of the story ( but without all the typical political bullshit ) ... though i 'm kinda scared that there is n't really anyone who truly knows what he is doing . 
  i just read up on it on [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_legislative_procedure#secondary_actors ) . 
  why is it terrible ? 
  the [ ` treaty on european union ' ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/?uri=celex%3a12012m%2ftxt ) article 16 ( 2 ) states that :  `` the council shall consist of a representative of each member state at ministerial level , who ** may commit the government ** of the member state in question and cast its vote . '', 
  so the respective member state has to decide how much individual power its representative gets concerning the vote . 
  typically a government will find a consensus on how to lead its country ( such as enacting laws and other lasting decisions ) and so they have to also decide on how to cast their one vote in the council . 
  if a government is in crisis and can not make decisions together they can no longer govern a country and should normally resign , triggering an election - but the details of this vary from country to country and are often written into its constitution . 
  whoa , did you just jinx us ? 
  tell them to slow down even more . 
   unless we completely stop having kids , sooner or later our population will stabilize if the average woman gets < 2 kids it wo n't stabilize . 
  someone think about the kids !, 
  hahn is austrian on top of it , so this should go over pretty well . 
  & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  okay , that wording is sure to stir up some shit . 
  sorry i only found a [ different \\ ( this time moderated \\ ) debate ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh-ek0dtv9g ) with subtitles . 
  this was after the first election round and both candidates were on the way to the run-off election . 
  yeah , hitler versus hindenburg would have been an awkward unmoderated tv discussion for sure . 
  is this a pan ? 
  i can never tell . 
  but that 's just called being logically inconsistent or being a populist . 
  edit : probably those terms just mean different things in other countries . 
  we also do not typically sort positions into ` left ' and ` right ' ( sometimes we do but it 's not applied to almost every issue ) , probably because we have more than two political parties . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  here 's a [ -  best of ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahqjqvwstfa ) on youtube , and this is the [ whole thing ] ( http://atv.at/atv-meine-wahl/gaeste-norbert-hofer-alexander-van-der-bellen/d1228604/ ) on the atv homepage . 
  please do n't judge us austrians too harshly , we know this looks pretty bad and it was a minor \u00e9clat last year . 
  it 's fair to say that our political discourse is pretty bad though . 
  god please no ... i 'm having flashbacks now . 
  with all due respect you can be against ttip without being simply ` anti-american ' as a european . 
  there are rational reasons to reject it . 
  ( and i know there are also reasons to support it , but it 's not an easy decision to make ), 
  damn we really blew it . 
  in retrospect i 'm not surprised though ... whelp , anyone wan na try for another world war ? 
  third time 's the charm is what i hear . 
  lets have italy on our side , they always belong to the winners . 
  there would be * a lot * of issues to think about . 
  does n't hurt thinking about it but this really seems like an idea that will go nowhere to me . 
  just the voting part for non-eu citizens alone seems crazy . 
  maybe if the eu were to look at it on a case-by-case basis , as you seem to suggest , and gets to choose the people it wants - though i do n't think non-eu nations would back this approach , they would mostly lose out with this . 
   but he ( | abe | ) added : `` we must not create conditions by which wealth becomes concentrated among only some people . '', 
  it 's nice to know that this particular topic is still prevailing in high political circles . 
  i hope he means it and has some measures in mind and this is n't just paying lip service . 
   the radical plan would allow uk nationals who applied for eu citizenship to work anywhere inside the union as well as giving them a vote in the european parliament elections -- while retaining their passport . 
  one would think such a thing would have to be reciprocated of course , so eu citizens should get a vote in uk parliament elections as well as the right to work in the uk . 
  ^ ^ ^ this ^ ^ ^ should ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ over ^ ^ ^ well . 
  sailing ships make me happy . 
  i do n't know why , but it 's just uplifting to look at one . 
  it 's because we all sit at a round table and instead of `` me , me , me ... '' everyone chants `` us , us , us ... '' . 
  at least that 's the basic idea for me . 
  one problem is that repatriation is still not possible ( or not done successfully , because of various reasons ) in a huge number of cases . 
  persons who are denied asylum are then still the responsibility of the host nation . 
  so this is part of why the line between immigrants and refugees is blurring . 
  that 's from the same show that started the ` america first , but can we say ( insert country ) second ' thing , right ? 
  that 's some good satire you guys got there . 
  i 'm jealous - wish we had some austrian show that could rival it . 
  a lot of names were n't asked , so he is top 3 out of those few listed . 
  notably missing is for example xi jinping . 
  i thought it was america first ? 
  oh ? ... so i should probably stop painting swastikas on buildings ... right ? 
  seems like he did n't actually say this . 
  ` hurriyet daily news ' either does n't understand what quotation-marks mean , or thinks providing sources for quotes is a thing of the past . 
  another job well done . 
  though we were in this thing together , were n't we ? 
  i do n't think the spreading thing is gon na work on a purely voluntary basis . 
  but lets call it ` plan b ' and think about a more realistic ` plan a ', 
  no one say deus vult or the jig is up . 
  they already suspect much of our plan regarding constantinople . 
  ** ramstein * air base, 
  that 's right - fuck you , plants and fungi !,
