  the establishment media still is reporting as if he did ... 
  when morocco sends its people , they 're not sending their best . 
  they 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems to us . 
  they 're bringing drugs . 
  they 're bringing crime . 
  we have some bad habibis here and we have to get them out . 
  that 's very interesting to hear and i am very intrigued since it goes directly against what i was told two decades ago when i learned about it . 
  could you point me towards the right literature ( english or german ) since i 'm eager to keep my knowledge up to date . 
  i was told that the material culture clearly showed an unified immigration of a germanic tribe and quick replacement or assimilation of the remaining celto-roman population . 
  that would be a bold claim . 
  maybe they referenced a specific group , day or specific protest ? 
  who calls the euromaidan uprising a peaceful protest ? 
  how is it illogical and what 's the problem with it ? 
   1866 was 152 years ago . 
  exactly !, 
  that means 150 years ago austria-hungary was not part of a political union with other german states any more . 
   it 's not only that , politicians also considered it essential to avoid another anschluss . 
  thankfully that part we are over with since 1995 . 
  the anschluss was successful and nobody even noticed . 
  not quite . 
  in 1866 the austrian empire lost it 's struggle against prussia over the control of the german federation and the federation was dissolved . 
  and to degrade it as `` simply one of several states '' is quite an understatement . 
  it was the mos dominant and powerful force within the hre and german federation . 
   are austrians realy germans ? 
  i dont wan na argue , but i think , that austrians have more similiar dna and haplogroups as czechs than germans . 
  in fact , bavarian ethnogenesis happened in bohemia thus czechs , austrians and bavarians cluster close together . 
  but we are closer to southern germans than they are to northern germans . 
  i think it 's this [ study from 2008 ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/science/13visual.html ) i have in mind , which has a handy graphic and map , but i do n't know about the methodology or what kind of statistical analysis they made . 
  there is also a lot of pre-germanic ( ie . 
  celtic or even earlier ) stuff going on . 
  the same . 
  austria before being independent was another part of the bavarian duchy . 
  ethnically , culturally , linguistically and even genetically , there is no divide between us . 
  as an austrian who knows a little bit of history beyond the crap they teach us in school . 
  i disagree . 
  austrians are of course germans we are just not those kind of germans you will find beyond the `` wei\u00dfwurstgrenze '' . 
  edit : but of course you are right , most people will be triggered , since not being german was an essential part in the [ victim myth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victim_theory ) or `` lebensl\u00fcge '' of our country after wwii and people readily adopted it . 
  it 's an easy way to get fiber but it 's simply not true that it has no nutritional value , of course it is n't as pecked as other leafy greens but it 's better than nothing and for me it 's a great way to fill me up more when i 'm on a cut . 
  how much must the sea rise for that to happen , is that a worst case scenario or simply a `` this will happen according to all simulations '' situation ? 
  i would like to invite you to my workplace next to a cultural center and kindergarten . 
  all the mothers pick up their children fully veiled . 
  of course they do n't walk much outside . 
  their life is contained between bringing their children to that center and cooking at home . 
  almost daily since i work close to a islamic cultural center . 
  it 's still not a common sight , but in 10 years it will be if the demographic shift keeps going ( which it most likely will ) . 
   panem et circenses that 's all what that is . 
  a couple of years ago it was estimated that only 200 ppl who wear a full face veil live in austria . 
  this number will go ( and has gone ) up if we do n't act now . 
   among immigrants and refugees burkhas and similar are not a thing . 
  complete nonsense . 
  there are many refugees and immigrants who are salafists . 
  i think especially about the chechen community , but also arabs , and turks . 
  your blanket statement , that it 's not a thing is just not true . 
  sure it 's a minority , but we have them here and they want to stay in our country with their believes . 
  i work near a cultural-center/kindergarten , with mostly chechen clients . 
  almost all women wear them . 
  similar in touristy places , malls and shopping streets . 
  saudis and arab oil money love those places . 
  you must really try hard to not see them . 
  or maybe you never leave your home . 
  yes , i really hope this is ( semi - ) permanent . 
  yesterday it felt like 99 % of new posts were shitposts . 
  i downvoted like a maniac and broke my mouse hitting hide , but 20 minutes later the new queue was again filled with that spam . 
  it was funny the first few times , but now all other content just drowns in low effort karma grabs . 
  all dedicated places of islamic prayer are called mosques . 
  and all `` official '' mosques are organized over these 16 associations . 
  even scarier are the many non registered mosques . 
  what do you think the ratio would be there if even the official mosques perform that poor ? 
  1971 gen. pop .

  515.914 6,2 % unfortunately there will be no more recent data since they stopped to ask for religion in the census . 
  but you can extrapolate a little bit to get a general idea that the islamisation of our country is a very rapid process . 
  half of mosque associations \u2260 half of moslems . 
  but yeah , there is a huge problem with the values and believes of mainstream islam and our values in the west . 
  i do n't think you can nor should shut down all mosques . 
  that would neither be helpful ( forcing them into underground ) nor ethical . 
  we should rather implement better screening for migrants from moslem majority countries and maybe stop handing out visa and stay permits like gifts to the poor for unskilled low wage labors and their families . 
  ** one in two mosque associations in graz are radical , says austrian police . 
  ** the 14 arrested could be viewed as martyrs , within the salafist network . 
  in graz the police asses half of the 16 mosque associations as radical . 
  after the arrest of eleven men and three women , in major busts against a suspected salafist-network in graz and vienna , investigative custody decisions are to be awaited over the weekend . 
  the suspects were placed in jail on friday , four in vienna and ten in graz . 
  as `` der standard '' reported , are the suspects , coming from austria , the balkan and syria , accused to have supported a theocracy in austria , modeled after the terror regime of is . 
  all 14 are investigated under suspicion of being in a terrorist and state-subversive organization [ two separate charges ] . 
  three of the arrested are preachers . 
  ** crackdown focus in graz ** about the question , how big the islamistic scene in austria is , the verfassungschutz [ domestic intelligence agency ] was not forthcoming . 
  the police in graz says that in their city , the focus of the crackdown with 800 officers involved , there are currently 16 mosque association registered , `` half of that is radical '' says police spokesman fritz grundnig . 
  ali kurtg\u00f6z , chairman of the islamic religious community ( `` islamische religionsgemeinde '' ) in graz , can not help either . 
  he and his community have `` no contact at all to these people '' . 
  sometimes he sees one on the street , `` but they do n't greet at all '' , says ali kurtg\u00f6z to standard . 
  ** `` persons not reachable '' ** the busts did of course leave an impact in the salafist scene , because persons , which argued for certain ideas are not reachable anymore , says the certified educational theorist ( diplomp\u00e4dagoge ) and islamism expert moussa al-hassan diaw in [ a standard-interview . 
  ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000051630804/islamismus-experte-diaw-die-polizeiaktion-hinterlaesst-ihre-wirkung ) he is also a member of the `` derad '' - network , which operates under call of the justice ministry in prison against extremism .
