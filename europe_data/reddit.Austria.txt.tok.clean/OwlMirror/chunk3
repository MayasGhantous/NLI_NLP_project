  diaw is also concerned that `` left are currently supporters who may view these people now as some sort of martyr . '', 
  ** not a single scene . 
  ** there is not just a single scene of salafists in austria , but `` different personalities , who once were friends and now are in competitive relationship '' and say about each other `` that each other does not have the right religious understanding '' he sees surveillance through the state as a necessary part against radicalism , but also stresses the importance of `` accompanying measures '' within social work , schools as in matters of prevention against extremism and radicalization . 
  ** `` less political squabbling '' ** members of the association derad try to reflect world views , the ideology and religious believes , together with suspects of terrorism in prisons . 
  often personal matters are discussed . 
  which strengthens the basis of discussion . 
  diaw thinks that austria compares well internationally when it comes to prevention and deradicalisation . 
  he wishes for `` less animosity , less political squabbling '' regarding that topic . 
  which values are praised within the islamic state , show videos for example , of the hate preacher , mirsad o. alias ebu tejma , who was sentenced to 20 years in prison . 
  in the videos the practice of sharia , `` right of the husband '' or `` treatment of slaves '' are discussed . 
  the justice ministry has asked youtube and other video channels to take down these messages . 
  but the platforms who are seated out of the country refuse that , because they do n't see themselves responsible for the content . 
  i always experienced his videos as well and carefully researched and viewed him always as a trustworthy source . 
  his style might not be for everyone ( stemming from youtube atheist - theist flamewars his tone has it 's merits ) so why would you call him untrustworthy ? 
  any good reasons besides his style ? 
  that 's not entirely true . 
  when you are long enough in remission your odds of getting cancer again become that of the general population eventually . 
  yes , printing was widely used before gutenberg , even for manuscripts . 
  his invention was the printing press and a more efficient workflow which made possible the mass production and distribution of books . 
  not everyone knows that s\u00fcd-tirol is majority german . 
  so it could be an easy to overlook detail . 
  note the german names in the region trentino-s\u00fcdtirol, 
  that 's the difference between ethnicity and citizenship . 
  most european states are nation states which formed along ethnic borders . 
  since these states are mostly named after the majority ethnicity it becomes confusing when foreigners and their children get the citizenship from these countries . 
  now we have german citizens who demand to be called germans while they are not germans , which is unfortunate . 
  we should adopt a new name for these `` paper germans/french/etc '' . 
  maybe deutschl\u00e4nder to make the distinction or something alike ( akin to the russian solution \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435 vs. \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 ) . 
  the success of rightwing and far right parties in many european countries does not support your claim that these are fringe individuals . 
  quite the opposite , xenophobia is widespread and a if not a majority a very large minority of europeans have concerns or are strictly against mass immigration . 
  so why do you act as if there is a need to organize such opposition to `` raid '' this sub ? 
  why ca n't this not be organic resistance reflecting societal reality ? 
  and all these countries get and rely on millions in aid . 
  the eu is a strong soft power in that region and the only think missing to apply the necessary pressure is the political will of germany and france . 
  but france is currently in the process of changing that stance . 
  name one such law . 
  i think that either the country you departed from is responsible or the one you landed in . 
  and how is it done in international waters ? 
  the approach there can be adopted for the bodensee . 
  if he would really have meant the stasi he would not have said `` less than 100 years '' but rather `` less than 30 years '' or `` less than 50 years '' ... 
  so i really doubt it . 
  yeah i 'm sure that 's what he meant . 
  but seriously , when someone says less than hundred years in reference to german history , we all know what he means . 
  have you already forgotten the g20 riots in hamburg ? 
  i think the high numbers are a direct result of the chaos the left wing extremist brought to the city . 
  please . 
  a large minority want 's more video surveillance , closure of radical houses who are organization hubs of violent extremism and want more police to to enforce the law when these violent extremists have assemblies . 
  your thought : `` literally nazis ! '', 
  all the countless turks on the streets here . 
  they sure do n't want to be part of europe , that 's why they all do n't come here and abandon their own country ... 
  i must have imagined them, 
  not the social democrats . 
  the sp\u00d6 always kept their mouth shut and targeted turks in austria as potential voters . 
  now all * parties try to imitate the right-wing freedom party . 
  reality was that before the parties did this the freedom party was by far the biggest party in all polls . 
  this has changed since everyone else adopted their program and still there is a good chance that they will be in the next cabinet . 
  * not literally all , but those who matter , and even the green break away candidate pilz is trying to fish in their waters . 
  everybody knows that there has to be eventually a privileged partnership agreement with the . 
  the eu ( or at least many members ) and the uk are way too dependent from each other , as to not have such agreements installed . 
  i would not characterize such a partnership as `` all the good stuff and none of the bad '' . 
  eu members will always have a first class status when it comes to deals made by the eu , but that 's no reason to not have mutual beneficial deals with third parties like the turkey or the uk . 
  it 's a rotten carrot on a bend stick . 
  when was the last time ankara did something because they thought they could get entry into the eu ? 
  how about we start offering a realistic deal , something like a privileged partnership which includes a free trade agreements and scientific cooperation without the free movement of people ? 
  the fact that turkey-membership is still not officially canceled but only de facto on hold is what 's annoying . 
  there is still the illusion that there will be a post erdogan anatolia which suddenly will be compatible with western values and ideas . 
  the hope is that we just have to wait for this shitshow to be over with and can go back to business as usual . 
  wrong . 
  turkey never was a viable candidate to join us and all pretense that it was , was pure dishonesty . 
  their values , culture and people are not european and have no place in a ** european ** union, 
  what are you talking about exactly ? 
  `` she '' is legally a man , are you transphobic ? 
  libya is very interested in maintaining good relations with the eu . 
  refusing a boat with `` rescued '' immigrants is very bad for that . 
  there is no reason for libya to not give that permission . 
  you have a very narrow and lacking understand of the human races . 
  while `` white '' is of course not a scientific term it still is almost always a descriptor of a person of european heritage ( european caucasoid ) . 
  hispanics are mostly of indigenous heritage sometimes with european or african admixture . 
  the silly classification system of color schemes you are using is absurdeldy limited . 
  but since latin american indigenous people are related to north american indians you cold but them into the `` red '' category . 
  hispanics are mostly mestizos or completely indigenous . 
  hispanics that are white are a tiny minority . 
  you really should take a book on physical anthropology and just skim it once in a while . 
  they are so obviously mestizos , have you never seen a mediterranean person ? 
  i mean , if you only have encountered turks than maybe i could forgive you . 
  how about you learn the language of the country you move to ? 
  no , i do n't . 
  i worked in implementing the technical part of a marketing solution for a party in switzerland . 
  meps get thousands of e-mails every month . 
  it 's far beyond anything a single person or even a small staff could sensible handle . 
  it 's all automated and  99 % of the responses are canned answers . 
  [ it 's massive body of law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_competition_law ) and i hardly know anything about it . 
  but you are not asking companies to hobble themselves but you outlaw certain non-competitive practices . 
  it 's similar to outlawing deceitful advertising , which you would n't call `` asking a company to hobble itself '' . 
  the idea is that a fair market is better for all parties involved . 
  no , they will get filed immediately and will be automatically assigned to a appropriate campaign when such a campaign is created . 
  there might be other work flows in place ( more generic answer after a certain time period without answer or even escalated to an actual staffer if the mail contains interesting trigger words ) . 
  the whole process is highly automated and frighteningly effective and accurate . 
  are you dense ? 
  this is a textbook e-marketing text .
