i just hate the taste . 
  yeah , me too , i was kinda disappointed . 
  i was looking for 2 hot blonde polish grills . 
  it 's the [ current year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyhqzvfypfa ) . 
  u guys running out of condoms or what ? 
  this shit is so bad , i do n't even know why we 're showing it in europe . 
  but be my guest . 
  i always confuse your flag with russia and your countries name with slovakia . 
  being a czechoslovenian must be hard . 
  i 'm gon na use american for transgenders . 
  why ? 
  because i can . 
   < br  reddit is n't into html . 
  nah thanks , everything we 're doing with germany does n't really work out . 
  first those silly wars , now the eu crumbles too , . . 
  i fucking hate that stuff . 
  you know what ? 
  i already said that i do n't think that she 'll ever be indicted . 
  but if she is i bet you 10 bucks that all her delegates and super delegates move to joe biden and sanders gets screwed . 
  i 'm dead serious , there is no way that sanders will be the nominee . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vfl0qwxugi ), 
  you make it sound like they 'll blow up anywhere randomly because they ca n't find the way to paris . 
   we live in the internet era which enable finding people with the same stupid beliefs as their own i have n't found anyone whos as retarded as me , i 'm looking since 2002 . 
  do n't you fucking dare . 
  i expected [ this ] ( http://pre09.deviantart.net/0ad3/th/pre/i/2012/037/4/d/beat_the_rainbow__kill_the_rainbow__by_mamacharms-d4owlaa.png ) . 
  you gave 0 suggestions on how . 
  protesting does n't work , voting in parties with right wing views is , according to you , bad . 
  so as a civil society , whats left ? 
  anonymous death threats to merkel ? 
  how do you reach political parties that do n't care about the citzens ? 
   s4p is outright delusional . 
  cmon , they are so cute . 
   i just spend my last dime on bernie , gon na diet till the end of the month , but its worth it !, 
  how can you not love them ? 
  they 're naive , fragile , just cuteness overload if you want more of that fluffy cuteness go to / r/pizzaforbernie where people spend their last dime to buy food for others that are phonebanking x ), 
   `` objective criticism '' of right wing views you are literally hitler . 
  is n't objective criticism ? 
  really ? 
  i always called it `` baguette country '' . 
   i did n't tell anyone what they should do , just what would be a sensible strategy in my opinion . 
   which would be literally nothing . 
  you presented your `` sensible strategie '' as sitting on your ass and hoping for change . 
   `` no chance '' is overstating it as long as hillary clinton is under investigation by the fbi . 
  ahaha like crooked clinton will be indicted . 
  my ass . 
  this shit gets burried , just like bills rapes . 
   you really believe that the far right will further yours ? 
  thats not the point , the point is that your vote is the only leverage that you have . 
  so either force them to change their policies by voting differently or try the right . 
  the `` far right '' is n't the issue , the afd for example would n't get over 8 % if merkel did n't fuck up . 
  merkel and siegmar gabriel are afds best recruiters . 
  make austria great again . 
  i think not !, 
   how much would it cost slovakia per asylum seeker if they took them in ? 
  the 250k are probably a cheaper solution . 
   czechia o'slovenia i kinda like that . 
   freedom of movement of goods , people , capitals and services is at the foundation of the eu . 
  i do n't see the part about the housing and the money for people who forced their way across the borders . 
   i am sorry you are being downvoted because you expose the right wing violence . 
   i think one of those were actually the far left trying to pin it on the right , but i forgot which one . 
  yes , germany is weird that way , this is a thing . 
   by all the means in their power humanitarian aid . 
  i 'm not sure if all means of our power would include breaking our own constitution since thats neither security nor defense policy . 
  btw , afaik we 're not `` full nato members '' , we 're just in the [ partnership for peace programme ] ( http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_50349.htm ) . 
  1999 when the nato broke our airspace to bombard kosovo there were actually talks about intercepting the nato planes . 
  but our politicians decided for a diplomatic protest and some mild sanctions x ), 
   austria certainly is no more neutral than say sweden . 
  http://nato.gov.si/eng/topic/national-security/neutral-status/neutral-countries/ yeah . 
  exactly . 
  yeah , because the world wars happend before we were neutral , duh . 
  the `` declaration of neutrality '' happened 1955 and is ankered in our constitution . 
  why [ would ] ( http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/msnbc/components/photo/_new/pb-130408-putin-merkel-da-03.photoblog900.jpg ) you say that , [ comrade ] ( http://i5.asn.im/merkel-putin-laughter-femen-_twwb.jpg ) ? 
   yea we 'll see what happens if an actual war ever did break out . 
   everyone for himself . 
  uh , and btw , we austrians are neutral , thanks , cya . 
   we view russia as an actual threat mainly because you 're right next to russia . 
  especially germany . 
  not to mention that hungary took in more asylum seekers than france , spain , portugal and many other `` western '' countries . 
   but they are useful for the future how ? 
  have you watched the interview ? 
  the article is actually pretty soft on him . 
   and you do n't have to keep explaining to random people that you have gained weight since you took your passport photo 10 years ago yeah , you do . 
  it 's not like they 're not checking for * any * identification . 
  i do n't get this , people are like `` u could n't really travel before the eu '' . . thats kinda bs ? 
  i really do n't see the difference between the current lines at airport security vs the border controls ( seriously ! ), 
  and yes i 've been born before my country joined the eu , i have lived trough those border checks . 
  hell , i even had one of those crappy '' [ starter kits ] ( http://assets.catawiki.nl/assets/2014/10/7/a/d/1/ad1ada0c-4e09-11e4-8e35-1ce4e3baf219.jpg ) '' 7yrs after we joined . 
  i want my restrictions back . 
  no , wait , i want new restrictions , i 'm cool with all immigrants , except the hordes of german economic refugees who work here and spent the cash in germany and the hordes of german students . 
  we 're being overrun here , send help . 
  shall i really explain to you what 7/11 means in that context ? 
  ah you know , left wing liberal media , you just have to crunch the numbers a bit , add or leave out a 0 here and there and tadaaa, 
   or another cologne type incident . 
  maybe your media can spin it arround [ like ours ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000036027978/sexualdelikte-dreimal-so-viele-oesterreicher-verurteilt-wie-auslaender ) . 
  yeah , its his [ own ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000024018670/gruener-bundesrat-doenmez-abgewaehlt ) green party fucking him . 
  really sad , they try to kill off the only one who makes sense . 
   same thing in other green parties in europe . 
  we have atleast one turkish muslim in our green party , he is literally the only sane guy . 
  totally against uncontrolles immigration , etc , he 's trying to be the voice of reason , thats why they try to mob him out of the party :d, 
  other breaking news : rain is wet , snow is cold .
