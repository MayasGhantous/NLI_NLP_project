   there is a correlation between working class and voting fp\u00d6 , ergo ther needs to be a restrictions on idiots voting . 
  which is hilarious irony , because working class people is why and how the left was formed . 
  literally everytime the fp\u00d6 went over 25 % . 
   where one is immediately the devil for supporting rightwing parties . 
  no , you 're still a nazi when you 're voting for the fp\u00d6 , atleast according to the sp\u00d6 and the gr\u00fcnen , the majority of people just does n't care about that stigma anymore . 
  the media is seen in a different light . 
  if you think about it , our next vote will be hofer vs van der bellen , its the ultimate far left vs far right showdown . 
  the political center is dead . 
  exit polls are the same . 
  they 're just as accurate . 
  nobody i know has been polled , the sample size is ridicilous . 
  those are exit polls , made by the same people that made the election polls that predicted van der bellen to win and hofer to get only 22 % . 
  yeah , lets take those polls . 
  found the green voter . 
  they managed to get second place in some regional elections no , you were actually right , they got 2nd in 2000 ( by only 3k votes ) . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalratswahl_in_%c3%96sterreich_1999 https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwarz-blaue_koalition, 
  2nd in 2000 . 
  if i remember correctly we had : 1 . 
  sp\u00d6 ( with viktor klima ) , 2 . 
  fp\u00d6 ( with j\u00f6rg haider ) , 3 . 
  and even tho sch\u00fcssel said he would quit politics if he came in 3rd he made a coalition with the fp\u00d6 and became chancellor . 
  one of the guys who would do everything for power and one of the reasons why the \u00d6vp is dying . 
  he 's the real sith-lord . 
  they 're drifting more and more apart , it 's true that the political climate is moving more and more right , but thats caused by the less educated masses . 
  the less educated tend to go far right now and the `` intellectual class '' are becoming marxists . 
  there is no real middle spectrum anymore , mainly because everyone tries to pander to their voting demographic . 
  no , with their policies they 're center at the moment . 
  sp\u00d6 is left center . 
  gr\u00fcne are left of the left center . 
  wow . . thats maga ... high energy . . and stuff . . 
  thats the german anthem . 
  edit : why r u downvoting me fgts , its the melody [ of the german anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yavbvk8ruqg ) , they stole that ages ago . 
  1/3 of the population are uneducated nazis , at least thats what our green party tells us . 
  that was 1\u00a01/2 months ago . 
  3 days before they closed the balkan route . 
  before . 
  in his last inverviews he said that there is no need to do that anymore since they did the necessary steps to close the route . 
  offical closing of the route was announced on march 10 , the interview was released on march 3 . 
  either you follow politics or you do n't , but stop spreading your half true bullshit . 
  edit : aw shit , i should 've dug out the last `` pressestunde '' and answered with a `` hm ? '', 
  to appear just as uninformed . 
  damn . 
  god no , please no . 
  that does n't work out , i 'd rather get annex 'd by slovakia , sry . 
  thanks buddy . 
   i do n't . 
  he would immediately dismiss the government he would n't , he already said that it 's not necessary since the goverment did change their course in the refugee crisis . 
  please do n't spread lies . 
  that 's not how democracy works at all , you 're confusing democracy with direct democracy . 
  yes , and the majority of scots do n't want a second referendum , so ... they identify with the uk nationality , you 're point is ? 
  oh right , you have none . 
   this is a matter of democracy , not some business . 
  actually , it 's just business . 
  i know you `` like '' to think this is about democracy , but it really is n't , right now it 's about deals and business . 
   no , you fucking do n't . 
  how would you know ? 
  would be pretty fucking stupid of her to tell you her plan . 
   `` strategic voting '' do you want to boost ukip ? 
  because this is how you boost ukip , which is dying right now , please let them die . 
  define `` national '' from her voters point of view and you 'll see the answer would be yes . 
   in the others austria is more ` yes ' then ` no ' . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56n1q0/federalist_sentiment_in_the_european_union_xpost/d8koou3 we 're basically always in the lower 3rd . 
  so yeah , lets take it to a vote , i 'm pretty sure it would be unfavorable towards federalisation . 
  have you seen austria on that map ? 
  because , as we as austrians have learned the hard way , there is sometimes a huge difference between opinion polls and actual votes . 
  you can give a gut feeling as an answer to an opinion poll , but most people tend to think longer before they cast a vote . 
  two speed eu will never happen . 
  muh , equality and unity . 
  i do n't . 
  too pricey , refugee crisis gives cheap labour that can work below minimum wage . 
   which there is n't another refugee crisis and there will be , no problemo . 
  honestly , as a innocent bystander , the labour party looks like it needs to be split into 2 parties , there is way too much tension inside of the party and too many different views . 
  uhm this is germany . 
  so nothing really ? 
  because if that 's enough to be a neo nazi then viennas current sp\u00d6 mayor michael h\u00e4upl was one as well . 
   hofer , who is nobody uhm , yea , . . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria on the right , the 3rd guy under `` president '' . 
  we want in your cool club . 
   arent the right and left wing also separated by authoritarian and liberal ? 
  uhm , do you remember the `` liberal '' udssr ? 
  so no . 
   right-wing nutjobs ( fascists ) not even remotely the same , fascism originated from the italian left and got great under mussolini , whose party was hugely supported by italian jews . 
  well , until he thought of hitler as a serious threat and tried to get cozy with him . 
  experts like [ roger griffin ] ( https://www.amazon.com/the-nature-fascism-roger-griffin/dp/0415096618 ) , [ robert paxton ] ( https://www.amazon.com/anatomy-fascism-robert-paxton/dp/1400033918 ) and many more generally agree that fascism is neither `` left '' nor `` right '' exclusive . 
  edit : i just realized the glorious irony in your comment . 
  blm is allowed to do that ? 
  i thought racist hate groups are n't allowed to exist . 
  tommy robinson was right . 
  it 's actually astounding how much the positions have changed , take austria for example . 
  22 yrs ago the left wing party `` die gr\u00fcnen '' were against the european union , while the right wing party `` fp\u00d6 '' was for it . 
  now 22 yrs later they 're the complete opposite . 
   `` refugees and all immigrants welcome !!, 
  so weird big corporations are pushing for the same !, 
  ooooh you 're wearing a veil !!, 
  it 's so empowering , you go girl , i 'm a feminist too !! '', 
  i legit laughed , because it 's true . 
  because the brexit is hanging above them like the sword of damocles , many corporations and `` important '' people were/are expected to leave a long time before article 50 is invoked . 
  so seeing growth in any sector is kinda odd . 
  people were expected to abandon the uk like rats would abandon a sinking ship , yet that does n't seem to happen . 
  you 're not getting it , the message has been received , now the regional candidates of her own party start blaming the refugee politic and merkel . 
  she 's losing support inside the party , thats actually huge .
