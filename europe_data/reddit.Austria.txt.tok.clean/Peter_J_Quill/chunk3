  the cdu would lose so hard . 
   the election was a regional election not really the point , the point is that the regional candidates now start to blame their own party . 
  this lose is actually big , it could divide the party even further . 
  again ? 
  nice lets do it !, 
  i want some polish booty . 
  ^ ^ in ^ ^ all ^ ^ seriousness , ^ ^ i ^ ^ seem ^ ^ to ^ ^ have ^ ^ a ^ ^ thing ^ ^ for ^ ^ blond , ^ ^ blue ^ ^ eyed ^ ^ polish ^ ^ girls , ^ ^ i ^ ^ think ^ ^ i ^ ^ might ^ ^ need ^ ^ some ^ ^ help . 
   with their party name attached which only shows that the party supports this candidate , but there will be no further affiliation as soon as the candidate becomes president . 
   t 's a technical distinction that you 're making into a whole big thing because ... why ? 
  i did n't , he did . 
  half of the country laughed about it , most people perceive it as ridiculous and shameless pandering , especially when he said that he was as independent as mrs griss from the first ballot . 
  but your flag , does n't seem every united ... 
  so , when are you people going to be a own country ? 
  you do n't understand that he 's not really independent , it 's just marketing . 
  where did he have his campaign parties ? 
  yes , in the offices of the green party . 
  who is financing his campaign ? 
  yes , the green party . 
  who is donating material goods to his campaign ? 
  yes , the green party . 
  who was their leader for decades ? 
  yes , he was their leader . 
  if a wolf looks like a wolf , smells like a wolf , talks like a wolf and keeps company of other wolves he 's still a fucking wolf , does n't matter if he identifies as sheep . 
  theoretically all presidential candidates were/are `` independent '' since you 're not voting for a party , you 're voting for the person . 
  and the president is theoretically obliged to retire from any party membership . 
  with millions from the green party , what was that , 2,5 million euro for the first ballot ? 
  i wonder how much independent money they 'll give him this time . 
  not to mention that they 're actually running his ad campaign and everything else , but yeah , independent . 
  nah , but we would take bavaria if you do n't want it anymore , you can keep the rest of your country . 
   the greens remain around 11 % in polls for like 2 years . 
  i 'd say glawischnig and ellensohn are mainly to blame for that , those people are completely unelectable and actually hurting van der bellen with their support . 
  no way in hell , those polls are probably as fucked as the ones from the first election . 
  edit : on a side note :  independent rival , alexander van der bellen hahahaha , decades the leader of our green party , been a communist for a short time too . . `` independent '' ... fuck me haha  hofer , whose party argued against joining the european union in a referendum on membership in 1994 so was alexander van der bellens , they we 're literally against it . 
  why only cite facts about the right wing guy ? 
  cmon . 
   i addressed him weird way to address him . 
   are you guys going to leave or not ? 
  so does he have multiple personality disorder or did you just address every brit ? 
  sorry , like i said , not big on the double standards thing . 
   there is also a general hate for eastern europeans , whether poles or hungarians or people from the balkan countries . 
  do n't hate on my v4 heroes . 
  not the heroes europe deserves , but the heroes europe needs . 
  short term , long term it 's actually slowly suffocating europe . 
  yet you addressed every brit in your comment , why the fuck should n't i see you like i see every other pole ? 
  i 'm not good with double standards , i treat everyone equal , sorry . 
  the uk is great , nobody likes netherlands tho . 
  stay away with your filthy trailers . 
  tbh , i 'm under 25 and i would 've voted for brexit as well . 
  i saw what happened the past 20 yrs and i do n't want this crazy downward spiral to continue , so change would be my natural answer . 
   complaining said the visegrad guy , . . okay . 
   a lot of it was about european unity i think ? 
  the great thing that made helmut kohl ignore greeces faked books and numbers . 
  got ta love it . 
  the cdu should make that their slogan `` european unity , just so we can make the future a living hell for our children !, 
   to get younger people voting they actually do , and a lot of younger people vote conservative too , but it 's way cooler and easier to portray it like the old people are at fault . 
   they chose not to elect him they 've dodged a huge bullet there . 
  kinda pathetic how his own `` party '' screwed him over and he decided to bend over even more , that guy does n't have what it takes for the job , sorry . 
  you need a reason to write off the money , which is what a couple of countries did , `` refugee aid '' did n't make it into the official budget . 
   some polls i 'm not talking about polls , i mean actual people on the streets who are constantly complaining if you ask them . 
  and most of them do n't care about the handling . 
   this is what most people see when you say romania nah i think of webcam models and ridiculously fast internet . 
   but did it anyway for cheap workforce , etc ? 
  ofc , did n't you notice that they 've started talks to exclude refugees from the minimum wage ? 
  besides , the whole refugee crisis helped the european economy , we need extra shelters , we need teachers for various languages , translators , more bureaucrats , ... 
  it 's a short term boost that will fuck us in the ass in a couple of years . 
  where ? 
  its pretty uncommon to find people who 're not completely disappointed by immigration politics and asylum policies . 
   they seem pretty committed to not finding out . 
   and after austria found out we we 're pretty committed helping them . 
  so , at the end of the day she had no idea what she was doing . 
  all hail our fear and planless leader . 
  better sorry than safe . 
  you can take a wild guess on why he resigned . 
   you know , without that `` magic wall '' you would be able to cheer for 3000 migrants daily ( ! ), 
  at the westbahnhof so maybe slow down a bit and think before whining about it . 
  living near the westbahnhof and seeing everything that happened 2015 first hand , . . yes i know , thank god for that wall . 
  you 're complaining about a minority in austria that did n't want a fence . 
  i can assure you that the welcome crowd was and is just a very very vocal minority . 
  weird assumption , especially since most european countries are drifting to the right and more and more towards nationalism . 
  49,7 % for a right wing presidential candidate was unthinkable 5 years ago . 
  if you predicted something like that people would 've called you insane . 
   those borders meant thousands deaths though !, 
  cuz u were forced to cross them . 
  so , who 's selling them the weapons for that ? 
  who 's financing that war ? 
  what 's the plot twist ? 
   but this is the best example to show how much we would dominate if we were to be a single entity . 
  who upvotes this garbage ? 
  like dude , you do realize that you would n't have nearly as many athletes at the olympics , right ? 
  you realize that the us is behind  the whole eu , 28 states , 28 limits < because they are limited and ca n't send everybody they want , right ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yougov [ post-brexit focus groups : no regret from leavers ] ( https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/08/11/yougov-focus-groups/ ) [ bonus . 
  ] ( https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-07-27/scotland%20independence-01.png )  fully 46 % of scots say that they would rather live in a scotland that was still part of the uk post-brexit , against 37 % who would rather live in an independent scotland that remained in the eu . 
  ( these numbers translate to 55 % vs 45 % once do n't knows are stripped out ) . 
  really ? 
  why ? 
  even walking is an olympic sport . 
  28 eu countries , the uk earned 67 medals , so the uk contributed to 20,62 % of europes medals , meanwhile the other 27 countries ... yeah ... 
  what a shitpost . 
   hitler by mentioning hitler you just took a huge dump on history , lmao . 
  you do realize that hitler was never elected ?
