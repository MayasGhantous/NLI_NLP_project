  right ? 
   but whether that 's ok in 2032 for an erodogan wannabe to find dissidents is another question . 
  i do n't understand remarks like this , last time i checked erdogan was voted in by the people , or am i mistaken ? 
  and during the coup erdogan had actual civilians fight against the military , so the people were the main force that stopped it , so uhm , how exactly is he this big bad dictator that 's acting against the will of everyone in his country ? 
  i mean shit , the turks here in vienna are actually protesting for him , i mean you have the turks at home that are for him , you have the turks abroad that are for him , but he 's the bad guy that acts against everybodys will and the population does n't really want him ? 
  does n't make any sense to me . 
  actually , working in it , you often get better job offers outside of vienna . 
   i 've lived in the 19th , the 10th , the 5th , and the 16th those are the `` decent '' parts . 
  it salaries in austria are kind of a joke if you compare them , so i 'm not surprised . 
   which nobody thinks about when you think `` vienna '' . 
  yeah , i 'm also pretty sure that seestadt aspern will turn into a dump pretty quickly . 
  probably gon na endup like the 15th district , just more isolated , just thinking about that . . brr ... 
  by / u/weneedtofederalize 's logic , yes .

  [ hehe ] ( http://9502-presscdn-0-95.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/dolce.jpg ) , [ who knows ] ( https://thecathwalk.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/dolce-and-gabbana-abaya-collection-fashionparade.jpg?w=640 ), 
   i know this because i live in a very multicultural city ( vienna ) and experience it first hand every day . 
  viennese here , can confirm . 
  its not `` bad business '' practice , it hinders communication , even outside of business , i just said where it 's taught , mainly business classes and psychology classes . 
  i do n't get why europeans are even having this debate . 
  in every business or communication class you learn that  90 % of our communication is body language , the rest words , so stuff like this should n't be allowed in the first place . 
  so the government needs to have less power , but fucked up religious radicals should be free to do whatever they want . 
  mkay . 
  you want to listen to that catchy song you like on youtube ? 
  nahhh gema , u ca n't listen to youtube . 
  germans do feel the need to do that , yea, 
  uhmm . . something something invasion ... edit : no , it was infowars , whatever . 
   not even 1 of our 50 states . 
  uhm , [ dude ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_u.s._states_and_territories_by_population ) . . 
   we 've got plenty of issues with immigration , lack of police resources , high real estate prices literally the same issues every eu country faces . 
  is it tho ? 
  the power of brexit . 
  are you personally electing the pm or a party ? 
  there is a huge difference . 
  our presidential vote for example is a direct vote for the person , so if our president was to resign we would have to vote again , our chancellor on the other hand comes ( usually , sometimes the make some deals , like sch\u00fcssel for example ) from the biggest party who has the most seats in our `` nationalrat '', 
   `` undesirable elements '' like the fn in france nice , so who decides what 's undesirable ? 
  ah well , i forgot , democracy is an illusion . 
  so they 're all speculating ? 
  concentration camps , lmao . 
   is may gon na serve a full term why would she ? 
  she 's camerons successor , she 'll serve till the next general election ( 7 may 2020 ) that 's how politics work , you do n't vote for a person , you vote for a party . 
  do you have a credible source ? 
  sorry , the independent does n't count , especially not an article that was written right after the brexit vote . 
   a newspaper tried it in multiple locations in germany , one of the restaurants charged them 8 $ for a decanter of water lmao , the people arround here would 've raised their pitchforks and burned that place down . 
  this map is bogus , lmao . 
  mh , in austria you can simply ask for a glass of water , some restaurants may charge you , but 90 % do n't . 
  proof ? 
  lol, 
  [ woooooooosh . 
  ] ( http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/checkmate-atheists ) thats btw the sound of the joke flying over your head . 
   europe = eu  no , just no . 
  til islam is a country . 
  fences do work . 
  checkmate atheists . 
   what \u00b4 s the point of man going to the beach without watching almost naked beautiful women ? 
  i have no idea . 
   it was sparked by assad 's violent crack down on the arab spring . 
  who says that the arab spring would 've happened without the iraq invasion ? 
  hey , they can fuck up that dictator , bet we can fuck up ours too . 
   europe is one of the biggest sources of weapons for the conflict in syria . 
  thousands of tons of weapons from eu are being sold and used by terrorists . 
  because syrians are the biggest group among the refugees . 
   they look slightly asian . 
  actual syrians look slightly asian and have a lighter skin color , the `` syrians '' you 're thinking of are refugees from morocco , afghanistan , ... 
  yeah , it was actually pretty ignorant , not witty , idc why that guy gets all defensive n shit . 
   not sure your point holds water . 
  black people commit way more crimes so statistically they would be more likely to get shot , but they are n't . 
  i do n't care about the population , i care about the crime rate , and even tho black people commit more crimes they get shot less often , explain that please .

  you should google the definition of fascism and read some books from the current experts .

  i do n't care about the population , i care about the crime rate , and even tho black people commit more crimes they get shot less often , explain that please . 
  not to mention that 2015 the police in america shot more than twice as many white people , but heyyyy . . black lives matter , we do n't care about the others . 
  police officers shooting blacks is not a real issue , sorry . 
  a chick in a french tent on the streets , i do n't think camping on the streets is legal , sorry . 
  nah , blm is a racist and fascist movement , this is n't about creating racism , it 's about expressing racism . 
  right , cuz its safer if you 're alone as woman in a warzone . 
  sooo , there are a lot of chicks left behind in syria ? 
  aleppo here i come . 
  * jk everyone knows that 70 % of the refugees are n't syrian *, 
   ( there is btw . 
  censorship going on currently on / r/europe which i just experienced first hand by my post being removed for providing statistics -- absolutely terrible nothing new , censorship happens in every sub , its actually quite `` okayish '' in / r/europe , at least compared to other subs , if you criticize , for example , the leftist newspaper derstandard in / r/austria the mods will flipout and delete your posts . 
   no you just gave me two weapons and one tool ( machete ) how 's a machete a tool and a tomahawk a weapon ? 
  wtf is wrong with you . 
  you 've never used a tomahawk to cut wood , chopping , . . ? 
  btw , knives are weapons , not tools , unless they 're table knives , who 've rounded [ tips ] ( http://www.ecookshop.co.uk/ecookshop/products/large/xlarge/zris0910.jpg ) . 
  there is even a historic context for that , but i 'm waaaaaaaay too lazy to explain it . 
   the potential impact of a knife and a gun is different . 
  the point is that the attacker could 've gotten a gun if he wanted . 
  yes , the laws exist , but the black market exists too , if i was willing to spent a couple of k 's i could get a gun in a matter of 2-3 days . 
  wait , the uk and norwegian cops are n't armed ? 
  i mean , a couple of months ago i was laughing at americans that we 're saying we 're being overrun by foreign invaders , ... right now i 'm not laughing that much anymore . 
  i liked benedict , he was at least a smart guy , the current one . . not the brightest light bulb . 
  i mean , i do n't think that islam equals terror , but i have to agree that the current pope is kind of a joke . 
   when this zany story is made into a major motion picture basically [ terminal ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227/?ref_=nv_sr_2 ) . 
   indeed , but most of us think that you can be german in a cultural sense without being an ethnic german . 
  which is kinda bogus , but i do n't care , i 'm actually on / u/mz6 's side of the argument , i just wanted to bait a `` progressive '' into an argument with him and wanted to see how it turns out . 
  i 'm not disappointed . 
   he is saying that there are tons of germans who are not ethnically german and that most of us do n't really give a shit about ethniticy . 
  nop , just baiting .
