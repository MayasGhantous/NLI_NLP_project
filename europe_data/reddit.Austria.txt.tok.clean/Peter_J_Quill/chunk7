  i mean , she 's austrian , but close enough to germany :9, 
  god damnit , even my country is in elo hell . 
   ** de ** mocratic ** r ** epublic of ** p ** oland , de.r.p . 
  there is no way they 're able to enforce that number . 
   except the other government already stopped that , yeah , after doing nothing for months . 
  if heinz fischer had any balls and did n't share a `` parteibuch '' with our former chancellor he would 've used his powers . 
  but like kreisky said , if things get difficult fischer hides on the toilet and comes back out when everything 's over . 
   i hope austria is a lesson to the globalists in brussels haha , dude , not fucking way . 
  have n't you heard juncker ? 
  he 's openly supporting van der bellen and shitting on the fp\u00d6 . 
  they will never stop . 
  i hope you realize that the germans stole the melody of our old hymn . 
   welcome to the v4 austria i actually . . like the idea . 
  god why do i like the idea , oh yeah right , because the v4 were the only ones with half a brain when it came to the balkan-refugee-route . 
  i really ca n't tell if you 're talking about the sp\u00d6 , the \u00d6vp , die gr\u00fcnen or the fp\u00d6 . 
  well , to be fair , the narrative is that `` burschenschaftler '' do n't recognize the state of austria . 
  he himself said that he does and it was never a topic in his burschenschaft , but since he 's member of a burschenschaft , well its fair game for the press to say shit like that . 
   they need to build a wall and make austria pay for it . 
  i hate those jokes . 
  the usa could actually `` make mexico pay '' for a wall , thats probably the easiest shit ever . 
  poland could n't make us pay for it because they 're not giving us any financial aid , if anything its the other way arround . 
   people are already pooping their pants over germany 's power in the eu . 
  hey , lets not forget the fact that most of the austrians do n't want to merge with germany . 
  hell , many of us do n't even like germans . 
  we even have our own curse words for them . 
  oh yeah , and we 're `` neutral '' . 
  we 're totally keeping that stuff and not pretending its still there but basically bullshit since we 've joined the eu . 
  thats actually better than it has been before . 
  when the fp\u00d6 was in our government we had to face eu sanctions . 
  let them cry as much as they want , as long as they do n't try to fuck with our economy again . . 
  you 're actually spot on , but we like to blame the fp\u00d6 and not the \u00d6vp . 
   i hate to bring this up but it irks me when people try to give the refugees ' inherent misogyny a free pass & throw it all on cultural relativism many throw it onto `` war trauma '' or something like that , hell some columnist in one of our biggest papers had the gall to say that our unions are to blame for sex crimes committed by refugees . 
  because our unions require them to wait a certain period before they can get access to our labour market , so he argued that they 're bored , thats why they start raping . 
   when trump becomes our president we get rid of it thats never gon na happen , do n't get me wrong , trump is probably going to win the shit , but he basically said that nato is important , but the funding needs to be cut so countries actually pay what they can , instead of the us paying over proportionally more than everybody else . 
   since it would never go past the german constitutional court now thats important , but we can ignore and break most of the other constitutions , but do n't touch the german one , god forbid . 
   the uk does n't want it . 
   like they 're the only ones . 
  look at our members from the former eastern block . . 
  i 'd like to autxit if that happens . 
  it 's never us , we 're neutral , huehue . 
  but germany is first , so guess whos getting annexed ... 
  or chaturbate . 
  you , i like you . 
  among ira that idea is the bomb . 
  oh you saw it on the news , well thats the news for ya , trying to portray a certain image and bringing you on their side . 
  he did n't produce satire in that poem . 
  he even said in his disclaimer , `` this is against the law , you can sue me for that '' , he deliberately broke the law and expected to get not prosecuted because hurr durr ima celebrity . 
  also , if thats one of your best comedians , well . . that explains all the jokes about `` german humor '' . 
  yeah , just keep joking while merkel is screwing you left and right , 
   when asked about the boehmermann case , mr tiemann said his own protest was more a mark of solidarity with two turkish journalists at the daily cumhuriyet , who were jailed on 6 may . 
  that i can respect and commend , the b\u00f6hmermann retard does n't deserve any respect . 
  rofl , i love how the german media can brainwash the simple minded population . 
  she `` threw him under the bus '' . 
  lmfao meanwhile merkel is laughing her ass off and signing ttip . 
  i saw it on tv as well , he did tell erdogan that he can sue him for that , he basically taunted him . 
   but it was done in the context of a comedic show no it was n't , he said in his disclaimer before he read the `` poem '' : `` this is something that you can sue me for erdogan , this are baseless insults , basically slander , and what i am doing here is not legal '' . 
  he did n't think erdogan would go trough with it , probably because his ego is just as big as erdo 's  . 
   like everyone does with trump . 
  well , thats a complete different issue . 
  the main problem of those sexist and xenophobic claims is that he does hire more woman than men and that he did hire a woman to oversee the construction of his tower . 
  so the issue here is that he can dispel those things pretty quickly and when people tried to make fun of him and his idea of mexico paying for `` the wall '' he was also able to show how this would be doable . 
   people with gender dysphoria have a discrepancy between the gender their brains are telling them they should be that actually depends on who you ask and which studies you quote . 
   then it 's just distasteful satire nope , it was n't satire , if it was he would 've attacked his character , god knows erdogan has a flawed character and there is enough ammunition against him , and real issues . 
  but he chose to spew baseless insults . 
  thats not satire , thats trying to be satire . 
   i believe that there are no limits to satire which can be true , but the problem here lies within the definition of satire . 
  a chain of blatant insults ( goatfucker and what not ) is n't satire . 
  the ss uniforms are hugo boss . 
  only production , but still by boss . 
   the doctor says you 're another gender but the doctor that was present at birth could attest that you we 're said gender . 
  i do n't see how this makes sense . 
   but are n't b\u00f6hmermann 's comments protected by freedom of speech ? 
   or do they qualify as insult or harassment or something like that ? 
  yes . 
  edit ; to clarifiy a bit , he broke \u00a7 [ 103 ] ( https://dejure.org/gesetze/stgb/103.html ) stgb which is very old , but he also broke \u00a7 [ 185 ] ( https://dejure.org/gesetze/stgb/185.html ) stgb and another one which i ca n't remember right now , so even if \u00a7 103 was abolished he could still be sued . 
  because its an outdated , draconian law that requires the government to do so . 
  it 's not a message that says , `` hey , yeah , put that man in jail '' , this does n't contain a message , it 's her saying , yeah do your job , i wo n't meddle with justice affairs . 
  she was completely right . 
  yup, 
  oh god another trump = hitler crap . 
  do you need to relativize the holocaust ? 
  like really ? 
  trump is kinda the opposite , deporting illegals and building a wall to keep everyone out is different than killing every foreigner and trying to conquer and enslave europe . 
  it 's basically : we want nothing to do with you vs we want to own you and every aspect of your life , bow down before us . 
  you mean we set the fashion trends ? 
  look at those nice hugo boss nazi uniforms and boss is still one of the most liked labels . 
  we 're too gud . 
  does n't matter , its a stupid statement so he must 've said himself . 
  * anti putin circlejerk intensifies *, 
  maga = make austria great again . 
  sorry but we 're first in line . 
   if you do n't vote nationalist , it does n't matter how native you are . 
  i 've literally never seen a right winger either express that or act like that . 
  usually they do n't care what you vote as long as you do n't insult them and give them a platform , if you take their platform away and start shouting matches they can get very unpleasant . 
   you have to sue your parents that they made a mistake on the birth certificate when determining your sex at birth . 
  what the fuck poland ? 
   its damn son . 
   unpopular opinion : i think it is true to a large degree . 
  there are exceptions . 
  being raised by a single mom and a grandma , ... this is so true .
