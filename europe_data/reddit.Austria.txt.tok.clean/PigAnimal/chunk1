ah this guy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q94syuddhxa, 
  i doubt it . 
  turkey has booming population . 
  i said it won the war for allies , not that it won the war alone . 
  without us joining and remaining neutral , i m saying war would drag out for longer and either be stalemate or victory for central powers . 
  or even if it was n't victory for central powers us helped the victory condition be much more on side of allies . 
  us won the ww1 for allies . 
  france was at breaking point and would n't be able to hold much longer , russia was out of war and germany got resources from ukraine . 
  with us bringing 1 million troops to western front it turned the tides , had they not done it would have been stalemate or even germany victory . 
  or anyways us tipped the favor of deals at the end of war for allies . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wgqgeotf4e you can see that war was never fought in territory of germany . 
   both eu and non-eu citizens travelling across the schengen area what a failure . 
  so now eu citizens get to be punished ( yes 5 more seconds is a punishment ) because of eu 's failed immigration policy . 
  edit : nevermind now that i think of it its only external border . 
  you do know that if juppe got 27 and le pen 1,5 % more from suprise vote and macro is nuderpolling actually it might be juppe vs le pen, 
  some 3,729,100 people identified as catholic - 78.3 % of the population - compared to 84.2 % in april 2011 the number is still good . 
  hopefully it will raise in % some time in future, 
  do n't worry the new irish will fix it http://i.imgur.com/2ujzspt.jpg ^ ^ jk, 
  aww , do n't get triggered . 
  they said welcome to europe . 
  if ukrainians want to go to romania they can go there , it is you who first got thought of western europe because you have inferiority complex . 
  this pope is traitor to christedom . 
  i miss old pope so much . 
  haha yea . 
  i found it on 4chan, 
  should have sank it . 
  do russians light things up for georgians or ukrainians that they killed/are killing ? 
  sadly many conservatives fall for trap that putin is crusader that spreads moral values here is good series on it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6krhd5madzy, 
  ye on economy wiki page on right side there are statistics but not every one is recent but recently too gdp grew in hungary every year , and since eu is about to start growing again it might improve even more but idk i 'm not huge expert on hungarian economy but i heard my friend say its doing quite good dunno if he is right . 
  maybe eastern hungary has problem with demographics and alot of people just migrate to budapest ? 
  also on first video i linked if you rewind at start even there orban mentions that he is very pro eu . 
  also here is 2017 forecast post that i remember . 
  tho deep in , someone comments says you are underperforming to other east eu members so idk but at least its in 2-3 % group https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4i0lia/eu_2017_gdp_growth_forecast/, 
  orban is very pro eu he said it himself and he is imposing sanction on russia as he said it himself because he supports eu . 
  unemployment in hungary is at 4,3 % . 
  and economy is growing at pretty good rates as for his support you can see him polling at 50 % + / - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_hungarian_parliamentary_election, 
  most based man in europe . 
  he also is doing miracle with his countries economy and is democratically elected with 50 % of vote from population . 
  real hero , here is his recent speech in epp https://youtu.be/s3rji8m93zi?t=2m1s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_hungary, 
  uk has full rights to defend its territorial sovereignty . 
  uk does n't go around saying catalonia or any spanish oversees territory should be independent, 
  memeber states ca n't do anything . 
  its brussels that orders italy to pick them up and if they do n't they get penalized . 
  dutch had their chance last week . 
  after uk and us pawed them the way they failed us hard . 
  i hope they become majority muslim . 
  support your local non-robot hiring pizza place !, 
  thats not how it works . 
  if uk stayed in eu and england voted leave will scotland voted to stay you would n't see england asking for independence . 
  is n't this out of context , i think its old and he said that promoting end of eu would be like them promoting for example ohio independence ,, 
  except they would die from water shortage and without rest of u.s and their companies their economy would be ruined, 
  we will never know, 
  everytime i scroll down and see emoji i think someone got gold so i go to check comment but its just emoji, 
  people who identify as serbs in montenegro vote differently then montenegrins . 
  polls do n't really support accession to nato https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_montenegro_to_nato#political_views, 
  the country has like 30 % serbs it so it will not be very popular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_montenegro#nationality.2fethnicity, 
  you invaded hre and killed so many . 
  also viking reperation when ? 
  why is n't bannon financing her , what is this . 
  trump do n't betray by letting most based party in france fall to russians . 
  also does n't trump have 3 billion what is 200 million for him , pocket change and this is very influential thing . 
  evevryone knew that it will not be good on start , but good in long term . 
  and even in start stats are better then even brexiters dared hope . 
  warsaw or budapest is pretty much 95 % + native and paris was n't like that 15-20 years ago, 
  have you been to paris ? 
  i do n't think there are french people there anymore, 
  i think you missed the joke , picture is just a joke . 
  ye as le pen supporter this is really sad to see . 
  putin is not a good guy and he hates west and is n't conservative here is a good video . 
  the fact that chinese territory remained around same and not conquering much out of their peninsula for 2000years is n't empire and is n't excuse . 
  yes europe to got attacked by mongols , but what i was trying to say is that if china was so advanced they could have stopped them , not die in tens of millions . 
  romans and later medieaval europeans used plate and were much more disciplined then chiense who mostly consisted of peasent armies . 
  romans also used bricks for aqueducts and a lot of buildings it was n't just certain stuff . 
  as for middle east you mention egypt which was roman , greek ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ptolemaic_kingdom ) and later byzantine province , cleopatra was greek alexander the great founded the city of alexandria and even rekt indians https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_hydaspes conquering big chunk of it and that was all the way in india far away from his home . 
  north africa ( carthage ) was destroyed by romans totally and was later roman province , which got conquered by vandals later on . 
  seleucids for example too were greek based kingdom . 
  and persia failed to conquere greece . 
  here is map of world in 1200 year . 
  http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/images/map-europe-1200.jpg also just to add on if ( i know that if 's are n't sources ) but if 4th crusade went to middle east instead of sacking constantinople there is a good chance that part of world would be christian and byzantine might still exist . 
  the reason it was hard for crusaders was because they needed to send troops from europe all the way to middle east will the muslims were close , and had barbarossa not drowned it would be even easier https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/map_crusader_states_1135-en.svg/800px-map_crusader_states_1135-en.svg.png, 
  i just wrote quickly random european kingdoms out of my mind , but anyways . 
  china never colonized anyone even with having so much time and they got rekt quickly by mongols . 
  romans used concentrate and bricks will chinese houses were from mud and wood . 
  if medieval european army was to meet chinese in field i m pretty positive they would totally dominate . 
  the arab kingdoms you mentioned only stole greek knowledge and used it as much as they could . 
  islamic golden age is a myth . 
  you would be suprised how advanced medieval europe actaully was . 
  not really . 
  no one could match europe from start of roman empire and onward ( only ottomans maybe ) . 
  you had greeks , byzantine , franks hre , england , austro-hungary , even tho there were wars , europe was always on top . 
  china was never richer then europe per capita chinese got played by russia ( siberia ) and other eu powers . 
  the builginds from medieval times are still all over europe https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_opium_war, 
  quite the opposite . 
  look at how much poland , romania etc are growing . 
  because they get around most money from eu . 
  love europe , hate eu . 
  europe has always been best and richest . 
  and eu would n't be bad if they were nationalist more and against non-european immigration, 
  it has nothing to do with standard of living or government policies . 
  rveryone knows pepole ca n't protest because of that .
