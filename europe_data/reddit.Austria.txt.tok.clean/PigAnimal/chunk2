  only when they are paid do they protest, 
  if we were to follow that graph for brexit or us election it would be wrong . 
  polls are spread out too much and the one that got it right last election is giving sd lead . 
  love reacts only . 
  and those commie blocks everywhere , ugh, 
  no one should take seriously anything this guy says . 
  erdogan is literally telling and warning eu about invasion and whats happening , yet eu leaders are cucked and will invite even more muslims in , as can be seen by their continued shipping of them into europe from africa, 
  do n't you have 50 % unemployment in youth , along with spain and italy that have huge numbers too . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lfdxol3xck yea sure, 
  lets not forget also that macron said you ca n't leave euro . 
  yea switzerland , uk , norway , iceland etc. . . would like to talk with you . 
  melanchon and le pen won . 
  macron underperformed, 
  the '' experts '' were predicting uk will implode just by vote alone, 
  this reminds me when i gave this picture to my greek friend to trigger him http://i.imgur.com/htd9cfn.jpg, 
  if operation barbarossa started on time they might have even taken it . 
  false and misleading . 
  swedes are very religous and most of them believe in god . 
  france is around 70 % christian . 
  spain is 70 % catholic and only around 9 % atheist . 
  finland is 70 % protestant . 
  this map does n't get right any of the countries and is atheist propaganda, 
  are you sure ? 
  you guys seem to be pretty steady on this chart https://www.google.com/#q=poland+population&amp;*, 
  yes i agree totally , but the timing of this is just not on the point . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_second_scottish_independence_referendum#opinion_polling last poll does n't seem like it . 
  what sturgeon is doing is shameful . 
  she only wants to be in headlines and is using this for her fame . 
  she also campaigns for scotish independence from uk so she can join eu . 
  how is that independence i do n't know . 
  anyways even if there was referendum scots would never vote to leave uk, 
  found it on 4chan someone commented it , and i saved it in my reaction folder, 
  how can she disagree , when its a known fact she got wiretapped ? 
  how is economy worse ? 
  do n't you guys have insane growth rates under erdogan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_turkey, 
  do n't give up friends we still have austria and sweden on the way https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_next_austrian_legislative_election https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_swedish_general_election,_2018, 
  ah intresting , i did n't know that, 
  just take days off and fly to your home country to vote like a man, 
  you know there exist things such as black market and smuggling ? 
  immigration wo n't be stopped and message wo n't be sent . 
  because dutch did n't elect wilders, 
  i did n't mean european union i meant europe , as continent . 
  here is one example i came across now http://i.imgur.com/c4vxqye.png anyways i m very disappointed with dutch elections , dutch you have failed europe . 
  i do n't think democratically elected leader with majority of vote and huge support that can raise riots with diaspora from other country is undemocratic and dictatorship . 
  when will we know results exactly ? 
  nothing to see here , rt and sputnik said this was totally okay and its west and natos fault . 
  media and elites campaigning against fillon and french public ate it all up , they are n't like americans to see thro fake news from mainstream media . 
  media and elites want macron in hard . 
  wait law also lets you target all religions ? 
  so you can target christians in their own country ? 
  what a disgrace , eu should fall apart . 
  why should christians not be able to wear symbols in their own country ? 
  this might be according to some eu report , reality on the ground is much different . 
  rats jump out of sinking ship first , will captain and elite crew members stay untill the end . 
  and ship is not even sinking . 
  why ? 
  we should not give more power to china , they manipulate their currency and do unfair practices on trade . 
  when people want less globalism these guys want it more . 
  chinese goods are cheap and low quality . 
  eu is acting like childs because '' ohh no trump won qq '', 
  turkey fought with west during cold war and for that we owe them something . 
  there is also us base in turkey and unlike others this one actually is very useful and used for operations in middle east . 
  also nato is military organization . 
  we should stop all support for kurds and seek to be more friendly with erdogan . 
  in austria for first round hofer was excepted to get 24 % according to polls but actually got like 35 % . 
  fake poll . 
  scots will never vote to leave . 
  this guy is in panic , he is afraid that he will no longer be able to rip countries off on trade . 
  thats why for first time you see him going on campaigning like this . 
  his country already stopped growing so fast and if trump does something about chinese unfair practices he is in even bigger trouble . 
  globalism is bad look at how china grew will us and rest of europe stagnated . 
  here is good article https://gefira.org/en/2017/01/26/davos-recap-the-globalist-elite-has-few-to-no-ideas-about-how-to-solve-problems/, 
  hohe energie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence_party_ ( iceland ) icelanders did good thing into not being tricked voting for the pirates/greens or whoever . 
  their current party is based and doing pretty good job , i do n't know how they did n't get even more votes . 
  filllon was set up . 
  media and elites are campaigning for macron . 
  they created these fake jobs and scandals around fillon and le pen . 
  and are most likely lying in the polls for macron . 
  and french ate it all up . 
  this will be probabelly be another poll upset . 
  fillon drew biggest rally ever but is supposedly falling in polls, 
  well thats the thing , invest more into it increase stuff and equipment and change their way of work . 
  well my first reply was a question , thats why it has question marks . 
  i asked if eu has the power to sink or turn back boats or is it to nation states like your first comment said . 
  so i wanted to have reply from someone who knows the laws/topic . 
  to save your nations borders ? 
  and to discourage future immigrants who try the same . 
  invasions should be repelled . 
  and i did n't mean necessarily sink on sight , i also wrote turn back , for example the way australia does it . 
  does n't eu have frontex ? 
  i mean if eu wanted to sink every boat and turn everyone back could they do it ? 
  us is good . 
  average salary in france is like 2500 euros will average salary in belarus is what 400 euros ? 
  the only reason russia is against us is because they want to be at the position that us is now . 
  if that happens there will be no democracy or free elections anywhere in russias sphere of influence , look at their ally like belarus or former ally ukraine how they got treated . 
  us is not perfect but it is preferably option by far and overall good . 
  would you be writing that comment if you were aborted ? 
  no one has anything against womens bodies . 
  if women wants to get tattoo on her body fine , if she wants to get piercing fine . 
  the problem comes when she wants to take someone elses life .
