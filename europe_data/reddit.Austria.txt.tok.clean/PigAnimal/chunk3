  fun fact : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persian_language iranian is indo-european language and i think india ( or north part of it ) is also, 
  russians will wear soviet star hat , and a cross necklace , it is seriously unbelievable . 
  soviets destroyed 20k + out of 30k churches in russia and were atheist state . 
  and funny part they get nothing in return . 
  what i meant is that le pen has the lowest chances of happening , brexit and trump had decent chances . 
  wilders will win but forming coalition will be the problem . 
  so what i meant is le pen has lowest chances of happening , and of all things is n't good for placing a bet . 
  but anyways okay bet stands !, 
  i 'm not saying she will win , i actually think she will lose . 
  i just think that her support is not 25 % but rather 30 % -40 % in first round . 
  and her real support is much higher for 2nd round than polls suggest . 
  of all things ( trump , brexit and wilders now coming ) she has the lowest chances of them all , but sure lets bet just for the sake of it since i m bored , if le pen wins i get reddit gold if someone else wins i will reddit gold you ? 
  do n't trust the rigged establishment polls !, 
  they just want to demoralize you into thinking it ca n't be won . 
  you will see near election how they will start telling the truth ( as not to be completely wrong ) and le pen will be surging . 
  thats my prediction . 
  elites and media are campaigning for macron . 
  they want fillon out macron in . 
  macron is 2nd hollande in disguise . 
  for example would you be making that comment if you were aborted ? 
  abortion = baby killing . 
  serbs in bosnia exist because serbs fleeing ottomans migrated to bosnia slowly , and started to gain numbers . 
  later during 90 's they tried to create their own state by war and ended up with republika srpska . 
  so that land always belonged to bosniaks untill serbian migrations during 16th century and onward in which they displaced local populace . 
  media did good job of sabotaging fillon and campaigning for macron . 
  oh please , mongols celebrate genghis khan and he killed 40 million , tatars do n't give a damm about their slave trade that brought out 2 million slavs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crimean%e2%80%93nogai_raids_into_east_slavic_lands and i do n't see ottomans caring much about balkans , or arabs about byzantine . 
  most feel good hating on americans . 
  the lgbtqwxzxnmd and liberal things you are so defending now were invented by americans . 
  it was excelent idea , but politicans in uk are doing brexit really badly now . 
  also of course britian will grow slower even brexit voters knew that economy would not do well in short term but rather in long run . 
   are republicans shitty in every country ? 
  france had it 10 times better under republicans and sarkozy then in hollandes time, 
  rejecting russia does not give you unlimited prosperity on the same day . 
  remember to like '' architectural revival '' on facebook, 
  that does not explain how he was at 70 % or whatever approval rating at one point . 
  he would be at 36 % from start then, 
  uk is a net contributor its the eu that should be paying uk back, 
  well they seem to be on path of recovery now if you are to believe euro maidan press http://euromaidanpress.com/2017/07/21/ukrainian-economy-continues-its-recovery-path/, 
  get rebuilt and take all the gibs then run away seems like good tactic . 
  but anyways poland will not leave, 
  hello my good friend https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_habsburg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war,

  what are you smoking ? 
  you have european culture and are european here are europeans helping you https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_lisbon, 
  not a single bullet was fired on modern territory of serbia in those wars be serbia  invade slovenia , fail  invade croatia , fail  invade bosnia , fail  kosovo war , lose blame everyone else, 
  50-80 million is whole ww2 . 
  thats if you count chinese who died in millions by japanese, 
   you know that they did n't have battle standards and flags in ancient times except they did , http://i.imgur.com/ppm5ywl.jpg . 
   ancient battles were chaotic as hell no , http://imgur.com/a/hvnim rome total war has taught me differently : you have to know colors , how would you say when someone ask '' how does he look '' you would answer '' yellow hair , green eyes '' etc. . you ca n't not know colors . 
  also ancient egyptians paintings had colors, 
  no way is that true . 
  how would they make battle standards and flags ,, 
  got ta give it to orban . 
  conservative , built fence , unemployment 4 % , 3 % gdp growth , no gmo , told imf to get out etc. . . 
  i could n't imagine being a pole and all i have on my mind 24/7 is ww2 and past . 
  everytime someone says something pole will see if there is some reference to ww2 or some battle '' exactly 321 years and 23 days ago battle x happened '' . '', 
  oh you are form nation x , let me tell you why you should pay reparation because of the battle that happened 734 years ago where you took some of our territory '' poles love to talk about how they conquered someone , but as soon as they are the game they cry, 
  i mean independent topics and titles are left leaning marxist topics, 
  reminder independent is communist news paper http://i.imgur.com/cihoxts.png, 
  christianity counts only , sorry man !, 
  thanks for getting it  god entrusted us to disembark su here is ultimate deus vult playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhhdbaah9dq https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uveskl8_w8 https://youtu.be/ky2kzjvnoky https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xk7ri-ibj4, 
  soviet union was atheist state . 
  not really a living standard heaven . 
  meanwhile us printed '' in god we trust '' on money and they won cold war . 
  china is also atheist state and also not a good living standard . 
  edit : also north korea is atheist state : what a lovely country with high standards !, 
  guys . 
  like '' architectural revival '' on facebook, 
  quick post pictures that trigger annoying poles . 
  get over it you lost a city . 
  if everyone got their city back whole world would look differently . 
  if europe wanted to stop this they could . 
  you do realize that ukraine and baltics is closer to europe then us so this is more eu-s problem . 
  also last thing europe needs is russia cutting of its gas because eu only imports russia 's gas, 
  there is also this . 
  the years are off because they were not added by original map maker but map it self is accurate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lfdxol3xck, 
  did americans liberate france so one french guy can use american made site and internet to shit talk about us from his caliphate . 
  did someone say cute idf girls thread ? 
  people need to differentiate between globalization and globalism . 
  first one is us being able to communicate with everyone on globe this easily . 
  second one is someone wanting to have 1 language , no borders etc. . . https://beinglibertarian.com/globalization-globalism-not/, 
  my comment was more related to comments in thread about how poles are poor and oppressed . 
  man usually just do n't care to go or drop out . 
  while women continue college and are more intrested in it . 
  really tragic case . 
  but poland is most xhenophobic nation that beats up ukrainians and germans that visit it . 
  poland has 0 german and uk immigrants and is hostile to non poles in poland https://en.news-front.info/2017/01/24/ukrainian-students-beaten-up-in-poland/ http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/artykul/270263,university-professor-beaten-up-on-warsaw-tram-for-speaking-german http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/06/muslim-girls-racially-abused-polish-holocaust-trip-170628085035959.html, 
  russia brainwashes citizens ( and it works 100 % ) . 
  they manage to spin invading of ukraine and georgia as heroic acts and crimea was never really annexed but its still part of russia . 
  and its ukraine that is invading russia in ukraine somehow . 
  everything russia does n't like is '' western nazi zionist gay anti-russian cia controlled puppet '' . 
  and they always deflect to blame on someone else , '' hey can you stop invading ukraine and georgia ? '', 
  and they respond with '' what you think us never invaded anyone ? '', 
  the cold war anti western mentality has n't left them, 
  turkey fought together with west against ussr and was huge help against them .
