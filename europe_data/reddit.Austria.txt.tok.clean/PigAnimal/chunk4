  with their water supplies , demographic shortage i do n't think they are . 
  it easy to grow economy from 0 like african countries are growing 5 % , but once you reach an actual point of having normal economy it gets harder . 
  their military/military technology is also just copy paste from us and not even close to us or nato militarily, 
  i would rather not live in a country that has no human rights , no internet to fap to anime and you work as a slave and does n't make any female vocal dubstep http://www.boredpanda.com/pollution-china/ https://youtu.be/kbnxnxwmoqu,

  gdp per capita is far from perfect but its as close as it is that we have now to measure wealth . 
  everyone has someone who is hero to their nation and enemy to other . 
  do you think turks like you naming street after john sobieski . 
  imagine if everytime turks sees pole first thing he says is '' oh you named that street after a guy that killed so many turks ! '', 
  do n't get me wrong i agree thats its a bad thing and we should remember our past . 
  what i meant that poles over do it . 
  when czech guy meets brit he would say '' hey sup '' and not go '' british traitors , remember that time when you betrayed us '' like poles . 
  poles are hands down most annoying nation . 
  everytime there is a facebook comment section they start arguing and bringing up the wars from past and it seems to be only thing they talk about . 
  `` my great great great great great great great grandparent was killed by russian i hate russians '' '' screw france surrender idiots i hate french '' `` britain traitors i hate uk '' '' i hate germans '', 
  you had your vote and your last pm won clearly .

  had that crusade went into holy lands instead of sacking who knows what would have happened . 
  communism had all the resources from siberia and if they did n't succeed with that then they never will, 
  thats why i said nevermind my bad . 
  it most likely did n't happen , i thought it did, 
  my bad . 
  i read some article when it happened about how s400 failed to detect them at all or how they only shoot down around 30 out of 59 missiles even tho they knew location in advance so it failed . 
  but nevermind, 
  the one that failed to stop tomahawk missiles in syria even tho they had strike location upfront ? 
  how is it us-es fault that terrorists blow people up ? 
  last time i checked no vietnamese goes and blows people up . 
  if someone will pick up ak and go fight if you give him enough money then he is at wrong . 
  what commies ( republicans ) did was atrocities . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/red_terror_ ( spain ) they wanted communism and they killed priests and would have forbid religion . 
  had franco not won , soviet union would have had another ally against west in cold war and who knows what would have happened . 
  get rekt commies https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_sqgrz5iam, 
  imagine how vile you have to be to offer someone to kill their baby for free . 
  to all people who support abortion , if you were aborted would you be reading this comment right now ? 
  yes just take the most extreme example possible . 
  abortion should be allowed only in case of rape and extreme examples like that . 
  http://i.imgur.com/x12synl.jpg in my games in around 200 russians in csgo maybe 3 behave normally and rarely speak english and when they do its to yell and use curse words , i have never seen someone so uncivilized https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trik3teqx8e . 
  also do i need to tell you to watch on youtube '' russia car dash cams '' or your homicide rate that no european nation comes even close to . 
  albanians are more european they you will ever be . 
  http://i.imgur.com/plm6cuf.png you have much more european born population in your country . 
  you are also not even close to germany or sweden with assyrians https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_people, 
  you also have like 2 % muslim population while many western countries have 5 % +, 
  italy just lets migrants pass through . 
  none of them settle or will be italian citizens , so i do n't see how is that any job . 
  its like '' hey countries up north , handle yourself '', 
  i m not sure but i think it might be other muslims shooting others in youth/gang exchange . 
  best wait and see, 
  where are the people who weave soviet union flag and then pick up lgbt flag ? 
  china is worst polluter in the world , and this is real pollution not some made up climate change . 
  paris deal did n't ask anything from china but asked all from us . 
  http://www.boredpanda.com/pollution-china/ china did and is doing more to pollute the world then us could in 100 years , and us is actually decreasing pollution, 
   i disagree with her assertion did you just assume the gender of that person ? 
   if you gon na burger around in r/europe wow such tolerance !, 
  why the racism for ? 
  you are using american made site anyways now jew gaser please do n't discriminate against other groups its against r/europe rules, 
  then you will end up with country that is in eu but loves russia more then eu . 
  how are they right when they always skip votes on immigration . 
  this is first time they called for less immigration i think . 
  they are party with no ideology of disillusioned left and right voters . 
  i do n't have any idea how they have such high amount of voter base, 
  and funny how when right had good scoring in local elections and m5 failed they immediately [ called ] ( https://www.ft.com/content/0da3830c-50fe-11e7-bfb8-997009366969?mhq5j=e1 ) for stop to immigration ( in rome ? ), 
  if that is n't populist then i do n't know what is, 
  well yea and kosovo if you will . 
  also bulgaria stands at 13 % they have turkish minority then comes russia , many etimates give it from 6 % to as high as 15 % . 
  yes even by % it has around 10 % muslims . 
  it will be a pure [ coincidence ] ( http://i.imgur.com/brgl8nt.jpg ), 
  soviet union and chinese peoples republic and venezuela also have people on their mind !, 
  but somehow people in those places always end up worse off, 
  are you just gon na play race card ? 
  economy in u.s was total disaster under obama . 
  just one of the things, 
  i agree that his le pen bringing might have been an overreach . 
  but the way you all responded pretty much goes with my comment . 
  and if anyone is bringing political bullshit its the guy that killed policeman not the american with comment that has best of france 's interest . 
  we here at r/europe are tolerent of all peoples , unless you are american ofc . 
  we also respect all opinions ... 
  wait you support donald ? 
  go back to t_d, 
  why is noone talking about how red resembles sultanate of rum -- seljuk territory . 
  and blue coastal cities near end byzantine . 
  good article . 
  but why are syrian refugees being blamed on putin ? 
  its merkel that invited them and its europe that refuses to close borders . 
  if eu wanted to , borders could be closed completely . 
  also reason putin is in syria is to protect assad . 
  thats why he is bombing mostly rebels and rarely isis . 
  reason he is protecting assad is there was supposed to be a pipeline between qatar or whoever that was supposed to supply gas/oil to europe and go thro syria making eu independent of russian gas/oil but assad refused it . 
  http://i.imgur.com/xoz2zw8.jpg also this article is from 2016, 
  get over it . 
  uk has so much newspaper you can choose from . 
  from left to right . 
  you ca n't take 1 headline and judge everything,
