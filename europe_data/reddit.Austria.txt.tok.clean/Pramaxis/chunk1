may you enlight me ? 
   senpai i see what you did there . 
   surely ww2 is still shaping germany 's general stance on nationalism do you really think so ? 
  i have a lot to do with germans at my age ( 21 ) and i think this generation of mine may know about what happened but does not see it as their/our part to feel guilty about . 
  why should they/we do so ? 
  neither we nor our parents were alive at time these things take place in history . 
  why should we feel any responsibility about it ? 
  hell no !, 
  one in a century is enoght !, 
  wait ... 
  this was good , you should turn professional . 
  please give us another one !, 
  and that is totally ok but i doubt you would say `` a plumbers work requires no skill . '', 
  until we all have a personal robot to work such things out we need those people and i think it is humiliating to deny their skill out of formality papers . 
  here in austria you spend your years between 6 and 15 in school . 
  if you chose to take an apprenticeship you work 3 and a half year in a company under supervision . 
  over this ~ 3,5 years you also visit a specific school type for your exact kind of work field all in all 10 months . 
  that 's it . 
  for regulare you turn 18 become hereby an adult and take on the duty in the military . 
  after this you 're ~ 19 and are a skilled worker with a good chance of keeping your job . 
  in the mean time others never worked over a longer period of time ( lack experience ! ), 
  and do n't have money to start a live on their own but are now allowed to visit uni . 
  before they are skilled workers too they have to spend ~ 3-4 years and an incredible amount of money they do n't have by their own . 
  times past and both examples turn 23/24 . 
  one has 7 years of experience and no dept for education while the other one just got started with full-time working . 
  i do n't like how the whole world only count an uni degree as an education . 
  could there at least be a hint or a footnote that austria and germany have an dual education in form of an apprenticeship ? 
  1/3 of the employees fits in this education . 
  not everyone need a tertiary education level to do skilled work !, 
  i 'm investing in your post . 
  please take my upvote !, 
  asterix comics ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  gota catch them all ? 
  there it starts again `` your fish is not fresh '' ... 
  made my day !, 
  i like you very much . 
  keep going . 
  it is definitely funnier than 9gag . 
  and i could perfectly speak and read it as it is . 
  wonderfull is n't it ? 
  we have '' \u00f6 '' as `` oe '' , '' \u00e4 '' as `` ae '' , '' \u00fc '' as `` ue '' , the three forms of `` s '' was back in time diffrently written , in austria it is still common and teached . 
  '' \u00df '' was the `` sz '' a `` ss '' is simply fast , this aplies to ** all ** letters . 
  `` st '' and `` sch '' are like `` eu '' as a kid you trail to speak it slow than increase the speed as it gets faster you hear the actuall sound . 
  a big diffrents in theory but not very used day to day is `` y '' but since there are the less used words of our language we simply do n't care . 
  not only in the country side . 
  in graz the authorities themselfs do it too and the payment you have to effort after you screwed it up is ** very ** expensive . 
  oh please com 'n with the dramatics !, 
  you 're just like the uk and france . 
  an old couple in a long term relationship . 
  get over with it . 
  for us it is easy because we write as we speak . 
  in french or eanglish you have rules to know which word or vocal is in which combination the one sound you never use in german . 
  we just read it in the order we write it , no rules just brain afk letter for letter . 
  made my day !, 
  thanks !, 
  but but ... what is with doctor who ? 
  what the fuck did i just watched ? 
  i was there some years ago . 
  lived there two months with my dad and his ( to this time ) new girlfriend and her family . 
  i ca n't remember everything but it felt very special to me back then . 
  we lived in viciebsk and the best experience i have is from the slavianski bazaar ( wirten correctly ? ) . 
  i had never seen so many people before and whole streets were filled with market stalls that sold literally everything . 
  i want to visit it once more for at least another two months if my savings allow it . 
  i think i 'm to shy for going to sauna . 
  but i would like to star choir singing . 
  what do i have to do , to make this my home ? 
  did you really used the word vibrant in this context ? 
  as i said nearly noone usese them . 
  still very exspensive and no benefits in comparison to normal ones in restaurants or hotels . 
  diffrent city . 
  i have seen two in ... like my whole life ? 
  our grades are : 1 ( very good ) , 2 ( good ) , 3 ( satisfying ) , 4 ( adequate ) and 5 ( insufficient ) . 
  they stand for % of the teaching material you understood . 
  i do n't remember the exact numbers through but a 4 on the edge to 5 ( which is `` failed '' ) was 60 % . 
  we get grades per annum . 
  we do n't `` take '' classes . 
  you are set up for them by the school type you take and than life with that choice till the very end . 
  every pupil has the same classes except one language one in a specific school type ( * 1 ) . 
  see number 2 . 
  we do n't have any . 
  we have chemistry , biology and environmental science , physics , math ( all incl . 
  ) , german , english , ( third language ) , sports , religion/ethik , music education , art education , history and social science / political education , computer science , geography and economics , psychology and philosophy and that 's it . 
  we have some in minor ( 10 - 14 ) schools and in bhs/bms ( special school types with focus on certain vocational training ) . 
  haha , that was a good one . 
  we have `` until next class '' and `` until next week '' homework plus some projects you should work on ( two per semester mostly ) . 
  ours work with the w-lan they use to assume the time of arive via the stations . 
  that 's so typical everything that is n't vienna is simplified as countryside . 
  with that logic 97 % of europe are countryside including 2/3 of capital cities of the eu member states . 
  wos ? 
  i live in graz and here you can but it takes hours because of the slow internet connection . 
  also vienna is more modern in such matters than the rest of austria . 
  you ca n't really compare vienna to the rest . 
  for example you had mccoffee and mcdrive three years before the rest of austria . 
  even if vienna would be more modern that would simply mean the other 7/8 of our poppulation ist stil the old way . 
  many viennese ppl forget that pretty fast . 
  did you try paying contactless on the farmermarket or some non-supermarket store ? 
  good luck with that . 
  at least i cover nearly all my need products that way . 
  nearly 5 % of the cards and supermarkets are contactless rdy .
