  austria/switzerland true neutral , checks out . 
  the incident itself was reported on and also posted here because of a strong connection to europe ; not only the selfie issue but the whole context ( visit of mogherini and improving diplomatic relations with iran ) is of interest to europe . 
  if you do n't like that , carry on to the next thread , instead of complaining in here . 
  thanks . 
  super cuddly close to japan , fine with me . 
  among all the positive , like the fact that an agreement has been negotiated at all , and the negative , like the republicans hawkish quest who apparently would love to go to war with iran tomorrow , i 'm pleased to see that apparently the community 's opinion on the matter is sensible , and that people do n't fall for blind anti iran rhetoric here as much as they seem to do in the us . 
  kind of fear-mongery in it 's main prospect , but actually making good arguments ( about the bigger-picture effects of the food industry missing foreign workers ) and drawing the right conclusions ( about the emotional decision for a `` revolution '' ) . 
  in the end , it could be seen as a big experiment : who and whose theories will be right , the cautious people , who feel that today 's economy has too many complicated links to be fixed by easy solutions , or the nationalistic-optimistic people , who feel that some big , bold changes are necessary and * will * secure a better future . 
  in the end , probably both will have been a bit right and a bit wrong about some things , but i 'm also in sure that i would n't want to live in a big `` experiment '' myself . 
  it makes sense in all places that pay some form of conditional unemployment money though ; and also in very much worse off places it can have benefits , like raising levels of education by making women less dependent on men 's income , and lots of other crazy things . 
  look up [ guy standing ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/guy_standing_%28economist%29 ) , [ he 's a proponent of ubi ] ( https://youtu.be/nnhagxy5dxq ) that [ knows his economics ] ( https://youtu.be/9oraivq45me ) ( edit : there 's also a picture of him [ sitting ] ( http://starecat.com/content/wp-content/uploads/guy-standing-economist-sitting.jpg ) ) . 
  and * then * you have conditions like in irak . 
  honestly , i 'd take my daily little bit of instability over decades of opressive rule and then violent revolutions afterwards any day . 
  i think a bit of both , as well as what is popular where ( cf. 
  traubi soda in hungary ) . 
  red bull is definitely correct for austria though , because notwithstanding the origin of the recipe , if you look at `` biggest softdrink producing company in a '' , you 'd still get red bull . 
  after consulting kodansha 's intermediary dict of jap grammar , my vote is on ** itaria nashi ** as well . 
  carries the fitting connotation of `` achieving something without x/not achieving something without x '' , while also being short enough to make it usable as a catchphrase . 
  this ; it 's about retraining customers to take a cloth bag with you to the store/always keep a small foldable bag on you somewhere for spontaneous shopping . 
  gon na have to get better at that myself ( or continually buy and then hoard the newer , more expensive canvas bags they now have at austrian aldi = hofer - i love them , they 're very sturdy and wo n't rip even when you load them up and something like a milk carton is poking them ) . 
  you 're forgetting that lots of people ( me included ) wo n't subsequently use the shopping bags as trash bags , instead they * additionally * buy plastic trash bags to throw away the plastic shopping bags in ( bc of different sizes , the latter wo n't fit my trash cans ) . 
  at least some of this will be avoided now ; mostly it 's about retraining yourself to take a cloth bag with you to the store/always keep a small foldable bag on you somewhere for spontaneous shopping trips .

  copying from higher up :  cowardly politicians were afraid of the restaurant lobby/chamber of commerce and found a typically austrian solution for the unavoidable smoking ban law ( `` make it a compromise that makes nobody really happy '' ) , which has set us back for years . 
  i ca n't wait for 2018 and the first proper smoking ban to take effect . 
  yes , because cowardly politicians were afraid of the restaurant lobby/chamber of commerce and found a typically austrian solution for the unavoidable smoking ban law ( `` make it a compromise that makes nobody really happy '' ) , which has set us back for years . 
  i ca n't wait for 2018 and the first proper smoking ban to take effect . 
  `` shall i continue '' , you just ended your own argument there mate . 
  nowhere here does it say that these countries are eu members , just that they have a special relationship with the eu . 
  you could say the same about switzerland , norway , iceland , georgia , armenia , and others , none of which are members of the eu . 
  but i guess if you 're this willful to be dense you still wo n't get it . 
  thank you for posting this !, 
  i need this in paper format to hand out to people !, 
  and frankly , the people in here complaining do n't know how good they have it . 
  frankly , you 're just trying to be a negative asshole are n't you ? 
  yeah , me too . 
  i think the comment chain turned sour after negative comments from one or two individuals . 
  ah well it happens . 
  hope you 're having a great evening . 
  haha , touch\u00e9 . 
  i like it , mostly for the fact that the meaning is fine , latin is working as a unifier by emphasizing our common cultural heritage , plus it is easily recognizable and frankly makes any chorus singing it sound totally awesome . 
  you 're free to come up with better lyrics though yourself . 
  also are you saying anthems should n't be appealing to big feelings and should n't be easily recognizable ? 
  i think you 're having trouble with the common purpose of an anthem then . 
  good luck making a sch\u00f6nberg hymn then i guess . 
  i 'm sorry , but you do n't get to shit all over people 's honest and well-meaning contributions without making better suggestions yourself . 
  to cheer you up after all the downvotes you 'll get , [ have a listen ] ( https://youtu.be/gbahpnd2qjg ) . 
  also great with [ lyrics in latin ] ( https://youtu.be/c_mefzb4yzk ) . 
  edit : the latin lyrics one is just a `` fan project '' and not in any way official , bc the official one does n't have any lyrics . 
  i personally enjoy the positive message of the german lyrics of the original ( especially the second verse , haha ) , but i might be biased . 
  orthodox churches/basilicas because of their round shapes look cute as fuck . 
  scandinavian churches all look so imposing and gargoyle-esque because of their high-drawn roofs ; very impressive . 
  there 's an interesting difference between southern west european catholic and northern west european protestant/evangelical churches . 
  a proud winner , totally deserved . 
  hope i 'll be able to go and see it once it is finished . 
  also i find it interesting that some church builders dared to go higher than the st. peter 's basilica . 
  not offended , but inconvenienced . 
  if you left some cash for them it means they have to come running after you to give it back , because that 's what 's done there when a customer `` forgets '' something . 
  your wanting to be nice does n't translate , and can have the opposite effect if one is n't able to adapt to local customs . 
  `` here have some money '' turns into `` i 'll make you run after me because i value my own feelings and doing what i 'm used to more than playing by your rules even when i 'm in your own country '' , that 's the rude part . 
  so sometimes , you got ta focus on the * outcome * , and translate things like nice gestures as well . 
  yeah , on twitter it 's the same . 
  makes me feel like we should counter with at least a * few * positive comments as well ; it 's a shame what kind of vitriol these people use a funeral ceremony for . 
  thanks !, 
  here are a few more bigger non-euro ones : indonesia - [ people 's consultative assembly ] ( http://www.mpr.go.id/uploads/galeri/kegiatan-pimpinan/69/197_20150814210020.jpg ) i really like the [ outside design ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vztcyhf7u3o/vao5jjvl7ui/aaaaaaaaeds/m9ov04xetp8/s1600/gedung%2bmajelis%2bpermusyawaratan%2brakyat%2b%28mpr%29.jpg ) and what they are doing with [ flowers ] ( http://www.mpr.go.id/uploads/berita/270_sidang-paripurna-mpr-2015-dibuka-ketua-mpr-dan-dihadiri-presiden-dan-wakil-presiden-ri.jpg ) india [ lok sabha ] ( https://saddahaq.blob.core.windows.net/multimedia/a517424116499977076540245547313.jpg ) [ rajya sabha ] ( https://a6-10418-so.ssl.ucdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/rajyasabha4.jpg ) china - [ the national people 's congress ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/the_third_session_of_the_12th_national_people%27s_congress_open_20150305.jpg/1920px-the_third_session_of_the_12th_national_people%27s_congress_open_20150305.jpg ) has about [ 3000 members ] ( http://www.womenofchina.cn/res/womenofchina/1503/15031067.jpg ) . 
  in contrast , the cook islands ' [ parliament ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/parliament_of_the_cook_islands_-_2006.jpg/1024px-parliament_of_the_cook_islands_-_2006.jpg ) has 24 members and is a former hotel . 
  fuck yeah , i love the one in strasbourg . 
  just so grand , and round , and quite modern . 
  like a ufo of diplomacy . 
  i hope that when they plan the new one in brussels it will be made to look similar to the one we have in strasbourg right now , otherwise i would miss it once the concentration on sessions being held only in brussels takes place ( whenever that will be ) . 
  yeah , and as always , he 's self-aware and [ can take it with a bit of humor ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d61kfyymz_a ) . 
  really respect him for that , smart phone or not . 
  that 's interesting . 
  while i would agree that sometimes you need to walk a few 100 meters to get to the next atm , i feel that discoverability is much better than in most other countries due to the uniform blue-green [ `` b '' sign ] ( http://cdn1.salzburg24.at/2013/02/bankomat-bb-650x435.jpg ) across bank brands . 
  i wish there was something like that in every country !, 
  hahaha , good one mate . 
  you 're trolling , right ? 
  right ? 
  my dad is buried in that bay . 
  long story . 
  this looks exactly like where i 'm from in lower austria ... this explains why i feel so close to my bohemian brudis . 
  it 's one of the last leftovers of showing sophostication and politeness we have left in written communication . 
  would you rather everybody just addressed it each other with `` he !, 
  ach oetti , my least favorite of all commissioners . 
  funny , i especially like the name about these news . 
  wow , powerful . 
  i did n't know this , thanks for posting . 
  disapproving of hunting down and prosecuting these people ... 
  i 'm sure you 're all for letting muslim extremists recruit for their cause and spread their message as well , right ?

  good . 
  hahaha ... 
  i really enjoyed reading this comment train so far , lithuania 's comments are all hilarious . 
  i like you guys . 
  oh wow , i did n't know this yet ... 
  thank you . 
  saved !, 
  if you can have yours , i want [ ours ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/austria-hungaria_transparency.png ) as well !, 
  yeah , randomly not liking france 's contemporary coa and then still taking italy 's does n't make much sense .
