  saved . 
  could somebody kindly post the article ? 
  it 's behind a paywall for me . 
  thanks !, 
  and some prune juice, 
  wow , switzerland must be really fucking great , if it 's even better than japan - which i had a next to perfect experiences with . 
  would like something like `` price '' added as a parameter though . 
  i wish we had something like that as our new `` hauptbahnhof wien '' ; it follows the same concept , but is much uglier . 
  great idea !, 
  i 'll leave this older post about [ wistman 's wood , dartmoor , england ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64tpbc/wistmans_wood_dartmoor_england/ ) here , to give credit as well as to refer to the posting i made about laurel forests , check it out !, 
  interestingly , `` aho '' means `` moron '' in kyoto dialect japanese . 
  hunterhunter something, 
  wait , are you saying ... that other children 's books are n't ?!, 
  wow . 
  if this turns out to be the case , i 'll have a proper til moment .

  honestly both numbers sound quite amazing to me , the first one even more so of course . 
  10 minutes pass so quickly when you 're busy ... 
  yeah sorry if i was n't clear , what i meant was that in comparing something inhabitant-related in different countries , it nearly always only makes sense to look at the * rate * , not the actual * amount * of something ( unless you * want * to compare absolute numbers of course ) . 
  and yes , in this case , per capita would me useful . 
  see edit above, 
  the hypothetical gain by people being able to fend for themselves in ( rare ) cases like this is far outweighed by all the shit that would happen ( often ) when people have easier access to weapons . 
  people can be assholes too , it 's not just the terrorists . 
  that 's why even in `` extreme '' times like this , it 's better to live in a country that handles weapons like japan , than one that handles them like the us . 
  feels unintuitive , but fuck feelings , trust statistics . 
  edit : of course i 'm talking about relative numbers , not absolute . 
  i mean , what sense would that even make ? 
  i remember reading that from the first emergency call being placed to the terrorists being shot it all happened in 8 minutes . 
  it 's not only about absolute spending amount , but also about efficiency . 
  see [ here ] ( http://imgur.com/a/cwqya ) with how much less the eu still accomplishes quite a lot , mostly because they 're not paying insane prices and `` r&d '' to arms companies . 
  native german speaker here , do n't know what all these people have , i think both dein gefecht and deine schlacht would be awesome expressions and very fitting for this occasion . 
  but i also have no problem with dein kampf , as long as it 's not used in that specific context ( nazism/hitler/a book ) , it does n't make me think of that specific dictator 's ramblings . 
  better safe than sorry i guess ... 
  thankfully , he did n't say it like that , the headline is pure clickbait shit . 
  off to valinor ? 
  nah , that 's just a byproduct of them being `` business friendly '' ... cancerous economic system . 
  ok , now i 'm interested in which context you would use it , and because its literal translation is just `` remembered '' : in what relation did you learn that word ? 
  if it 's any consolation , anything that has its own bank branch counts as a city for me . 
  austrian village boy here . 
  a good example of how being a member of the eu allows you , through cooperation , to * better * protect your borders than when you 're an outsider . 
  yes , and that was exactly my point , maybe i should clarify that above . 
  notwithstanding the original meaning , what is called a `` d\u00f6ner '' in germany is called a `` kebab '' here ; when actually , both names make little sense , and something like `` d\u00f6ner kebab sandwich '' would be correct . 
  ok now i 'm getting hungry . 
  i politely disagree , as that was exactly my point : if i went out to buy one right now , they would sell me a lammkebab , mit scharf , mit k\u00e4se ( it 's beef actually , but that 's another story ) . 
  can somebody copy-paste the text ? 
  a `` d\u00f6ner '' is called a `` kebab '' in austria though . 
  the naming after ingredient or preparation method but with no reference to the `` filled bread '' version makes no sense anyway . 
  i often hear kebab sandwich ( as opposed to falafel sandwich ) these days , makes more sense but sounds awful . 
  i 'll stick with kebab . 
  sorry , just commentig to state that i do n't agree ; but this just shows how different opinions can be . 
  i was expecting it to score high and was already upset about it . 
  hey , i like this as well . 
  thank you !, 
  i can not speak for all of eu , but what i like most about austria is our [ cakes ] ( https://az809444.vo.msecnd.net/image/3285191/0x0/0/recipe-bamischokowienerart2872015.jpg ) , [ pastries ] ( http://images.ichkoche.at/data/image/variations/496x384/3/apfelstrudel-rezept-img-20473.jpg ) and [ sweet main dishes ] ( https://www.wien.info/media/images/kaiserschmarren-gross-30306-19to1.jpeg ) . 
  oh , and of course dark bread , and [ schnitzel ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/wiener-schnitzel02.jpg ) . 
  thank you very much for the links !, 
  i will watch what i can later . 
  personal opinion : good in the sense that integration and investment helps us all prosper ( and also acts as a deterrent against violent conflict between trading partners ! ) . 
  i like that china seems to be willing to take responsibility on the international stage . 
  also , i expect the states along the corridor ( central asia ) to profit most . 
  i have to admit i also do not really know about the usefulness of rail transport , when the world economy relies so much on container/sea transport ; or is that also a part of the belt initiative ? 
  lastly , i have to say i am a bit skeptical when i hear about chinese buying/owning ports and other strategically important facilities in europa ; this is not against china though , i would also be skeptical if this was done by the us for example . 
  honestly ? 
  the cause is instability and wars in the middle east , to no small part caused by us meddling in the area . 
  the reason for it to become a problem in europe is missing coordination between eu members , and no proper solution yet for the issue `` we ban people from trying to come , but if they manage to come , they have a chance of staying '' ( please note that i do not disagree with helping people who flee from war ; but still i see this as the main problem that has to be dealt with in one way or another , either by opening asylum centers outside eu borders , or by having working resettlement treaties with african/middle asian countries ) . 
  english will still be the most important language in the eu , as well as internationally . 
  this was ( mostly ) a joke statement by juncker , the reason for holding his speech in french was the upcoming french election . 
  that being said , juncker has this way of unconventional joking ( very dry humor , sometimes sarcastic ) , and treating powerful people like anybody else , which i really like for a diplomat ( watch him [ greeting government leaders and commissioners of various eu countries ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpgii46fcdu&amp;t=1s ) ) . 
  that being said , with the uk leaving the eu , of course the influence and `` culture '' of the anglosphere will go down , some people are worried that this will mean more influence for germany & france , but i do n't think so . 
  generally , some of the uk 's attitudes ( towards integration , monetary union , etc ) have been quite different from the rest of the continent for a long time , and the uk was often perceived as an `` unwilling '' eu member because of it . 
  there is hope that without the uk , some eu reforms that have been stalled can finally take place now ( shared defence ; closer integration ) . 
  i do not know the songs of this year yet , i do n't want to take away the surprise . 
  also , let me say that i love the eurovision song contest because of the community aspect , i think it 's a great idea . 
  but the music itself is often very kitschy and `` good because it 's funny/bad '' ( with a few exceptions ) . 
  most countries send unknown acts , some even [ joke acts ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfecivoxxbo ) , and to be honest , over here we mostly watch the contest while getting drunk with friends . 
  there are a few songs i have to admit i actively listened to after the contest was over though , [ not alone ( armenia 2013 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chkjpnogiwq ) was one such song i really liked . 
  for making a statement about the best song `` of all time '' i have n't by far seen enough ; one of the better ones of the last few years that i have to admit i listened to voluntarily after the contest was over was [ not alone ( armenia 2013 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chkjpnogiwq ) . 
  also the artist is called aram mp3 , ` nuff said . 
  why have i only seen this just now ?!, 
  thank you !, 
  watch the video . 
  it was a dry , half-sarcastic remark , uttered next to the real message ( that he 's talking in french because the election is close ) . 
  for that reason , and many other qualities , i think he 's a great diplomat , and one of the best we currently have - even though i do n't agree with some of his neoliberal policies . 
  but from a human perspective , he 's a great guy . 
  and solidarity , peace , and justice !, 
  for the opposition to be pro-eu , the government has to be anti-eu . 
  but at least we have grassroots movements now : / r/acteuropa , pulseofeurope.eu, 
  good speech , good assessment of the work ahead . 
  let 's get to it !, 
  having countries compete in a `` race to the bottom '' is only good for companies and not for the countries or its inhabitants . 
  happy independence day , flag bros !, 
  that begs the question , european liberal ( libertarian ) or american liberal ( left-leaning ) ? 
  have an upvote . 
   also , sorry for that guy 's retarded comment . 
  thank you for the summary !, 
  here 's a good [ summary by the ny times ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/europe/marine-le-pen-emmanuel-macron-france-presidential-debate.html ) . 
  here 's a good [ summary by the ny times ] ( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/europe/marine-le-pen-emmanuel-macron-france-presidential-debate.html ) . 
  i for one really like him on a * human , personal * level , even when i do n't really agree with huge parts of his neoliberal stance . 
  interesting how what you seem to be taking as a lack in manners and unprofessionalism ( and i can totally understand why !, 
  ) , i see as a healthy dose of humor , fine irony , and a capability to not take yourself too seriously , and also not be too concerned with `` tact '' , which imho is exactly what 's needed when moving in circles and dealing with people that are used to being in power and that are sometimes unhealthily obsessed with their public image .
