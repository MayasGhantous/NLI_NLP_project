  more obama than erdogan , if i would have to out it succinctly . 
  even though we seem to have wildly differing views on national sovereignity and probably also the basic function of a nation state , i wanted to thank ( and upvote ) you for explaining your point of view in this comment and the one above so logically and succinctly ; also i fully agree with both your assessment of the existing strong link between union and single market , and on what you said about the volatility of public opinion and its susceptibility to slogans and media spin . 
  well , after brexit there 's hope that they will actually use this opportune moment for reform , as in deepening the union , and to establish processes that were not possible before . 
  with enough luck , this can be sold to the public as a success - but only when the eu learns from its mistakes and gets better at communicating with its inhabitants ( or , opposing the criticism ) . 
  great and more or less neutral article ; recommended read . 
  yeah , at this point i think you 've done and said everything you could . 
  i enjoyed reading the discussion by the way . 
  this is important in any negotiation , making sure your point of view is clear to the other side . 
  i 'm sure their team had more things prepared than just that , but somehow it seems that 's upsetting to you . 
  seriously , what did you think they would do ? 
  indeed . 
  i am convinced that having someone who is capable of irony , joking around , and jovial gestures in a position of power and where a lot of negotiations need to be made is a hundred times better than having someone who is meticulously concerned with his own status and projection of power . 
  better obama then erdogan , so to say . 
  so , in that sense , he is one of the best statesmen we have had in the last 50 years , and i 'm happy he 's our commission president right now . 
  even when i do n't fully share his neoliberal approach , from a * human * standpoint , he 's a great guy . 
  welcome !, 
  like your flair ; might have to steal it for one thing or the other . 
  ooh i thought we can just share !, 
  killing all the ... this argument makes so little sense , i do n't even know where to start . 
  please refrain from spreading such utter nonsense . 
  i will link this comment if you do n't mind ; succinctly explained . 
  did you know that ireland and parts of the uk ( mostly wales and western scotland ) are one of the few places in [ europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/zonobiome.png ) where naturally vegetation of [ zonobiom v ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biome#walter_.281976.2c_2002.29_zonobiomes ) would occur ? 
  this means forests that are , without human intervention , only limited in their growth by winter temperature , but ( unlike most of the temperate regions ) never by a lack of water ( winter tends to be a really dry season in most places ) . 
  the resulting vegetation is closely related to the [ laurel forests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/laurel_forest ) that often occur in cooler subtropic areas ( bamboo forests in japan are quite similar ) ; it 's a dense and dark forest that ( for the uk ) can be characterized by [ sessile oak ( quercus petraea ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quercus_petraea ) and an abundance of plant species ( thick immergreen undergrowth , lots of epiphytes and lichen ) - a typical `` dark and mysterious fairy tale forest '' !, 
  fascinating stuff .

  do n't know enough about the matter to have a valid opinion . 
  know a few people from there , who are all pro independence . 
  personally , i think people are being used by politicians to distract from other problems , and that they would be worse off on their own , so personally i 'm against a seccession , but who am i to say . 
  not * that * many more actually . 
  we learn english ( starting in 3rd grade , nowadays in 1st grade ) , because of course we do . 
  and then we learn another additional language at a later stage ( for me it was spanish , could choose between that and french ) , starting around 14 as well . 
  so if you subtract the obvious english , we actually had the same amount of language education . 
  no i would n't say that , because these countries are not `` nearly all of europe '' . 
  bigger churches have them , smaller ones do n't . 
  my sample is n't too big though . 
  have an upvote !, 
  also , would you maybe know the source of this ? 
  well he 's technically correct ; same as asia being a european peninsula . 
  honestly , this is arguing about semantics , especially since the division between these two continents is quite arbitrary . 
  to add to that , middle europe : no shoes inside . 
  * especially * guests , would be super rude otherwise . 
  people will sometimes provide slippers for you . 
  only exception to the above rule seem to be plumbers , electricians and other handymen , for some reason they are allowed to walk through our homes with their shoes on while they 're working . 
  you are free to feel uneasy and dirty about it though . 
  wow , as an austrian , why did i have no idea about this !, 
  looks like runes . 
  til , thank you . 
  at least have an upvote . 
  which alphabet was it ? 
  who ... who is this semen demon ? 
  do n't know enough about him to deserve having my own opinion ; i imagine i could find a lot of turbocapitalist groundwork being laid by him , which i would n't appreciate at all . 
  great answer , and you touched on all the imho equally important points . 
  thanks !, 
  edit : one could add that the . 
  serves the function of , in numbers above thousand ; so us 1,000 is european 1.000 ; and us 0.9 is european 0,9 . 
  sorry [ german version ] ( https://youtu.be/f-2jxml2zmk ) best version no contest . 
  but seriously , i compared a bit ( polish , greek , portuguese ) , all of them are good ; and weirdly all of them are better than the english version imho .

  for some people , the logo is like any other logo , a fashion statement ( especially ny is a little bit like nike i 'd say ) . 
  for most other people ... have you tried finding certain articles of clothing * without * a logo ? 
  we are just used to t-shirts and hats having nonsensical prints like `` surfing ' 86 '' or something like that , and to us it never means anything , so ... meh . 
  i might add that in contrast we normally do n't wear clothing with our sports teams/school logos on it casually ; some people might do especially with their football teams , but if it 's not kids it always seems a bit lowerclass/hooligan-y to me personally . 
  martinshorn ( for air horn ) is another one not many people know about . 
  also , k\u00e4rcher for pressure cleaner/power washer . 
  for tampon . 
  also tupperware , jeep , tippex , post-it-note, 
  ah i love viennese dialect for things like these ... with the meaning of `` you are dumb/not such a bright fella/not experienced '' : `` so you came swimming here on noodle soup or what ? '', 
  `` he 's not the brightest piglet of the farrow . '', 
  [ devil 's choice ] ( http://www.firelandfoods.at/shop/de/chilisaucen-2/devils-choice-hot-sauce.html ) , it is soo good !, 
  ah stoiber , holding trumpleton speeches before it was cool . 
  also , have some [ classic maschek impersonating stoiber ] ( https://youtu.be/-527t5rmo0g ) . 
  very common , at least in my family as kids we always used to look forward to hiking trips in the forest because there might be walderdbeeren ( `` forest strawberries '' , while the normal ones are just erdbeeren `` strawberries '' ) to be found . 
  we never put them on sticks , just ate them directly from the plant . 
  in later years we had some in our garden as well , they propagate quite well ( might be protected though ) . 
  lately i 've seen more and more forest strawberry jam being on offer in the more hipstery natural produce markets , so i think they 're getting more popular . 
  other common berries to have in your garden/eat when you find them in the forest are of course [ raspberries/himbeeren ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rubus_idaeus ) and [ blackberries/brombeeren ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/blackberry ) , and also [ redcurrant/ribisel ( including the white species ) ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/redcurrant ) , [ blackcurrant/schwarze johannisbeere ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/blackcurrant ) , [ gooseberry/stachelbeere ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/gooseberry ) , [ european blueberry/heidelbeere ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaccinium_myrtillus ) , [ lingonberry/preiselbeere ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vaccinium_vitis-idaea ) , [ barberry/berberitze ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/berberis_vulgaris ) and other fruits like [ slow/schlehe ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/prunus_spinosa ) or [ european cornel/kornelkirsche ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/cornus_mas ) . 
  interestingly , other berries ( cranberry ? 
  wortleberry ? 
  moosbeere ? 
  etc. ), 
  are unkown here/not found in the wild and people do n't really know how to tell them apart . 
  i am under the impression that in scandinavia you have more and/or different types of berries , is that true ? 
  and on a final note , does anybody else think that the blueberries you can buy in stores are 100 % different ( big , solid , green on the inside , colorless juice , very bland taste ) from the ones you can find in your garden/the forest ( smaller , squishy , dark blue or nearly black juice , strong sweet taste ) ? 
  shame that they can even sell them under the same name . 
  what 's the difference between a truck load full of bowling balls and a truck load full of babies ? 
  second one is easier to unload with a pitchfork . 
  in summer : barefoot . 
  in spring/fall : socks . 
  in winter : socks and [ slippers ] ( https://www.haflingerversand.de/pic/311013_36p.jpg ) . 
  my family does the same . 
  assuming 3,000 net salary : ooh i wish !, 
  could save about 2,000 per month that way !, 
  5/10 , would be higher but often something i do n't like happens : austrians ( me included ) seem to possess some kind of cringy desperation when answering questions about their own country .
