  knowledge about the inappropriate meaning of this flag is slowly spreading though , but in the meantime , please excuse our weird use of this old nationalist symbol . 
  on another note , me personally , i liked the design , and find it unfortunate that it has such a negative meaning now ; again , quite comparable to the svastika symbol . 
  hey , some are not as bad as i would 've thought after reading the `` our state flags are horrible '' statement on / r/vexillology a lot . 
  i actually really like some of them , most notably arizona alaska colorado new mexico ohio tennessee . 
  also , south carolina looks surprisingly middle eastern , a palm tree and half moon ? 
  come on , the only thing missing is some arabic writing !, 
  and texas looks kinda like the czech republic . 
  over here , they 're only used for garden work . 
  i envy people in japan , where the situation is like in taiwan , and crocs are accepted as `` a day out in the city '' kind of shoes . 
  so comfortable in summer . 
  i even brought some home with me , but now i do n't dare to wear them except for a tiny trip to the store around the corner ... 
  baumkuchen , basically, 
  i think we do n't apologize after the fact , so i ca n't think of an expression . 
  social conventions on swearing are not as strict as they seem to be in the us though , a little bit of swearing never hurt anybody , and i 'd say there 's no clear distinction between `` bad '' words and `` good '' words , just a gradient from politeness/sophistication to rudeness/frankness . 
  if somebody would cross a line , the listener would probably just frown silently , same for the person who was talking too harshly , and then continue quickly , trying to not pull too much attention to it . 
  ( something i noticed in other situations as well - for example , americans seem to be very quick to excuse themselves for coughing while speaking , or when mumbling involuntarily ; and while we of course do the same , we would rather `` not pull too much attention to our mistake and keep the opposite side waiting even longer '' , and instead get on with the talking as quickly as possible , and ignoring the mishap . ), 
  also , for emphasis and expressing strong feelings , instead of using outright swear words , we sometimes use switching between standard german and our local dialect , that gives your words the same kind of `` flavor '' . 
  lastly , there 's a few other expressions used in such contexts i can think of , most importantly `` sch\u00f6n sprechen ! '', 
  ( `` speak ( more ) beautifully !, 
  '' ) , which a teacher would use to scold his students when they 're using swear words in front of him ; another idiom is `` reden wie ihm der schnabel gewachsen ist '' ( `` talking how his beak has grown '' ) , woth the meaning to talk freely/frankly , and not give a shit about who might listen . 
  while not answering the question , i hope that was interesting . 
  interestingly , in vienna it 's only once a year in october ( ? ) . 
  only realized i got used to that when i could n't comprehend the siren suddenly going off ... 
  i have to say , i really dig the colors after the rebranding !, 
  professional yet bold , it makes whatever car model look great . 
  they 're not really totally closed , but it depends on the party ; some of them even allow people to decide who should be put on the list and all allow some kind of feedback on how they should be ranked ; over the last years , i feel there has been a push to increase that kind of voter participation . 
  and why it was not implemented differently , that 's a good question ... historical reasons ? 
  spain and portugal !, 
  i just love the iberian peninsula i guess . 
  let 's get started at the top shall we : * germany : ( + ) : the hundreds of years of shared history ; the fact that people generally try to do a good job and aim for quality , long-term solutions and stability ; also hearing their politicians talk , they seem to be much more competent and level-headed than ours , especially remarkable when you think about all the hardships the country had to overcome over the last decades - and now look at them !, 
  you go my northern brudis !, 
  ( - ) : the directness , actually . 
  we 're much more indirect down here in the south , and i think that a `` vielleicht k\u00f6nnten wir das anders machen '' feels more harmonious than a rude `` nein das geht nicht '' * czech republic/czechia : ( + ) : the beer , the food !, 
  half of what we are famous for in regards to cuisine , we got from you guys !, 
  i also like your laid-back and not-so conservative attitude , and the fact that you got your shit together so quickly after the fall of the curtain ( peacful separation anybody !, 
  ) ; you truly do n't get enough credit for how much of a nation from the very heart of europe you are ; also , i like your letter \u0159 ; also , beautiful girls ( - ) : * slovakia : ( + ) : great capital that you can go to on a bike trip from vienna !, 
  i know some kind and warm-hearted people from there that i hope i can visit soon ; other things just said above are valid here as well ( - ) : * hungary : ( + ) : the vegetation , i really love the hot and dry pannonian steppes !, 
  a wonderfully frightening but super interesting language ; also , great capital that feels very much like home , but still different ; great cheese and sausages ; and again , beautiful girls ( - ) : the current politics ; also , bullshit eastern conservatism among some people * slovenia : ( + ) : the landscape !, 
  oh my , one of my best trips i 've been on so far was going by train through your autumn colored forests ; great food in that neat area between carynthia and italy and slovenia ; also , great climate and nice access to the sea ( - ) : sometimes , bullshit eastern europe conservatism and machismo * italy : ( + ) : the food !, 
  also the islands in the south , and the beautiful countryside in the north ; the millenia of history ; the friendliness and openness ; that you take family very important ( - ) : the hawkers in touristic areas ; the language ( sorry , i somehow like spanish more ) * switzerland : ( + ) : the mountains ; that everything is clean and well-kept ; the political system ( - ) : the system of doing money laundering for other countries ; also the people sometimes feel a bit too reserved and conservative for my taste * liechtenstein : ( + ) : the fact that you managed to still exist ( - ) : the fact that you sought a close bond with switzerland instead of austria, 
  in my `` field '' ( side job as a student , fully supporting myself ) i think i 'm doing ok ( 900 $ / month ) . 
  although lately i 've had a few situations where people were shocked to learn i earn that little ( i 'm already above 30 ) . 
  i mean of course i 'd like to have more , but it 's not like i 'm starving or anything ... 
  i do n't know , what do you people even spend all your money on ? 
  what field ? 
  no , because we do n't have district representation ; you vote for a party and that party decides who to give their seats to , location does not play a role in that . 
  does the party i voted for last time represent my interests ? 
  meh , could be better , could be worse . 
  once a day on the morning , unless i 'm having a super lazy couch potato day . 
  twice a day when i 'm in the tropics , it 's necessary . 
  it 's ok to make any statement as long as you preface it with `` i do n't have anything against * these * kind of people , but ... '', 
  asian ( everything from soy sauce to instant noodles ) / turkish ( and greek stuff ) / american & mexican ( peanut butter , tortilla ) / italian ( loots of veggies , cheese , ice cream , ... especially at spar ), 
  had me laughing there ; saved . 
  to be fair , that 's kind of the same language ... 
  100 % agreed, 
  thanks , you made my ( lazy zwickltag ) morning . 
  feeling both amused and weirdly patriotic now . 
  i for one would love to see a movie about some [ gentlemen spies , sworn to protect the kaiser ] ( http://www.prater.at/_img/img_0002.jpg ) . 
  yes , but slapped not spanked ( interestingly that seems antiquated to me , do n't know anybody else who ever received a classical `` spanking '' ) . 
  that being said , born in 1985 , two times as far as i know . 
  first time was when i was about four or five , ran out onto the street and nearly got hit by a car , got a slap for that , mostly because my parents were super scared at that moment ( it was really close ) and overreacted . 
  ca n't even remember that one myself . 
  the second time , i must 've been around 10 , i was a little shit and was really asking for it ( testing boundaries ? ) . 
  my mum had threatened before i would get a slap if i do n't stop and had to follow through , hurt her more than me i think . 
  i turned out alright , and i think there 's certain situations where it 's warranted , we do n't grow up in a 100 % aphysical world where using words always works . 
  of course , it should still not be considered the norm at all , emergency situations only . 
  oh , i was under the impression that what makes communism a bad system ( and unrealistic for us to really achieve in any real way ) is the fact that it requires oversight by all-knowing , truly benevolent leaders , as well as very detailed and fine-tuned planning ( while in reality , people are always prone to corruption , and information transfer works at less than 100 % ) . 
  a truly advanced ai , i would imagine , could surpass those shortcomings and do what we as humans ca n't do , which is allocate everything accordingly to a `` maximize total happiness '' program , without being corrupt or favoring certain power groups . 
  but maybe you 're right , that still does n't address the `` missing incentive to work '' problem of communism , maybe the actual system that would be implemented by the ai would need to be more stimulating and would look more like a mix of today 's social democracy and capitalism instead anyway . 
  the important thing is that it would have our best interest at heart , and maybe , if it 's truly advanced , it would not even need to decide and plan for us ( as in communism ) , but instead * make * us * want * to do in a free system what is in the best interest for the big whole ; but here it gets tricky because we 're entering the discussion of free will , and what that `` greater good '' should even be , so let 's leave it at that . 
  why ? 
  `` common ownership of the means of production , absence of social classes and money '' ... sounds pretty utopian to me . 
  it 's different when you 're on a holiday . 
  i have been thinking about how being ruled by a benelovent ai in a dictatorial/communist system would be better than what we currently have . 
  karpfen , as in the carp fish , and krapfen , as in a type of [ sweet fried dough ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_fried_dough_foods ) . 
  knedl - kn\u00f6del - dumplings , interestingly used in singular/uncountable form only . 
  flocken - flakes , sorry if it 's been said and i oversaw it, 
  yeah , indonesian , in weekly lessons in a small classroom setting ( 4 ppl ) . 
  vienna ; and yes , mostly newspaper sellers . 
  they also helped a lot during the refugee crisis , i remember that being in the newspaper a few times , but not as many people might now about that . 
  lol . 
  exotic - all the classic predator animals like wolves , brown bears , lynx . 
  only in national parks though , most people have never seen one . 
  more common , and still dangerous : ticks ; snakes ( vipera berus ) ; wild boars ( they once damaged a friend 's car ) . 
  i think others already mentioned and linked most of the important ones , just wanted to add what i remember : my german teachers were n't big on literature , but i recall having read die schachnovelle , nathan der weise ( lessing ) , die welle and die verwandlung ( kafka ) . 
  we also started faust i , but did n't get very far . 
  a shame really , loved reading and always liked doing it for class , but i guess learning proper grammar and orthography was important as well . 
  back in the 90s , i learned [ this version of `` schreibschrift '' or `` lateinschrift '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/4/4a/schulschrift_1969.jpg ) ( writing script or latin script ) in second grade , after having learned a `` blockschrift '' ( block script , capital letters ) and `` druckschrift '' ( print script , like block script but also lowercase ) [ similar to this ] ( http://images.derstandard.at/2011/07/08/1308730057361.jpg ) in first grade.that also marked the switch from writing with pencil to fountain pen . 
  i remember how fun it was to write those overly round and loopy b 's . 
  my brother learned [ this newer version of schreibschrift ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/0/0f/schulschrift_1995.jpg ) a few years later . 
  it is important to note that we did n't learn what we call [ `` kursivschrift '' ( cursive script ) ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_kurrentschrift#/media/datei%3adeutsche_kurrentschrift.svg ) anymore , i think the last generation that did was my grandparents ' . 
  we still had lessons ( as part of `` bildnerische erziehung '' , drawing classes iirc ) where our writing style was graded . 
  i remember it being stressed that you join all the letters within a word . 
  starting from first or second grade of middle school ( 5th or 6th grade in total ) we started developing more personal writing styles , and our teachers did n't give so much about beauty or joined letters anymore , only legibility . 
  according to some articles i found , that way of teaching is here to stay for the coming years , which honestly i think is a good thing ; i think learning a proper latin/cursive/joined script is important for developing your own writing style that is not totally horrible to read , and i think having legible handwriting will still be an important skill for years to come ( until we all get brain implants ) . 
  i do n't get the hate on handwriting that exists in some countries at all . 
  maybe they stuck with teaching a joined script that is too ancient and unwieldy to properly write quickly ( look at [ those g , i and s in zaner-bloser ] ( https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5005cd4be4b046f04f5a1111/5331ef79e4b08fbf00961a26/536a6a6ee4b047c985cba5dc/1399483175145/simplecursive.gif ) for example , reminds me of our old cursive ) . 
  oh and to answer your questions , i learned ( and use ) the versions of 7 with a dash and the one of 1 with the slope ; only during my time in japan did i switch to the local ( american-style ) version to prevent misunderstandings . 
  now i 'm mostly back to normal . 
   also , i 'd like to share this [ interesting blog post ] ( http://cndrnh.blogspot.co.at/2009/03/german-and-american-handwriting.html?m=1 ) about american/european handwriting styles .
