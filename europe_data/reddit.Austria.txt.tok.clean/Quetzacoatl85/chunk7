  totally agree , even down to the discounters . 
  r with hacek ( sorry on phone ) is pronounced like both a trill ( spanish ) r and a `` sh '' sound at the same time , right ? 
  german ( bavarian ) - no differences come to mind that were more cultural than personal , but i think it would have been noticeable had she come from further north , judging by experiences i had with a roommate from northern germany - with her the directness took some getting used to , blatantly being told `` no ! '', 
  instead of `` hmm i think it would be better if ... '' felt quite rude and/or unsophisticated to me if i was n't making a conscious effort . 
  chinese - difficult , images of how a girl and guy behave in a relationship were very different , i was coming from a `` we 're both more or less equal and want the same things and should communicate about what we want normally '' side , and she from a `` we both have our defined roles , my job is to pamper her when she acts like a spoiled kid , in return i get spoiled in culturally acceptable ways as well '' side . 
  being taken care of when eating out ( she thinking about what i would like , ordering everything , then looking for the best pieces on her plate and offering them to me ) was kinda fun i have to admit . 
  also , very open-minded , no religious hold-ups . 
  indonesian - she grew up quite westernized , so we 're not too far apart . 
  i like the emphasis that is being put on getting along not only with her , but her family as well , how important good food is ( also , it 's not seen as `` manly '' to eat lots of meat and spicy , and `` girly '' to eat mostly veggies and mild stuff ) , and that she thinks about others and our relationship to them - like she 's trying to shop for souvenirs that i can give to my bosses at work . 
  also , she 's very musical ( you 'll say that 's a personality trait but in my experience singing by yourself is much more accepted there than it is here ) ; and she lets me to be the handyman around the house . 
  very happy . 
  has some body issues , maybe due to being raised strictly religious ( she 's atheist now ) . 
  in general , i have to say i like the pragmatic approach to relationships that i experinced in asian countries ; a relationship works well if two people care for each other , are faithful and get along well enough , anything else is a bonus . 
  both can still be different and like different things without that being seen as a bad thing . 
  made me realize that in the west , we sometimes tend to overburden our relationships with so many expectations , our partner should be our best friend , but also spiritual soulmate , and romantic partner , and also the hottest most desirable person to us , as well as caretaker/provider/jokingly teasing but also loving/tender and strong/etc . , and if he/she does n't fulfill all those images , we tend to question ourselves if this really `` mr/ms right '' for us ; i think it would be better if we were more relaxed about all these expectations , and could see the good things without having to look for everything in one person . 
  we normally go home for lunch except for maybe once a week . 
  mexican , thai ( salads like som tam , yam wun sen ) , indonesian ( especially padang meat dishes , sundanese veggies , and bali seafood stuff ), 
  well , if you 're only ever preparing food by boiling/frying , and never by baking , you can save a lot of space that way !, 
  literally billions of people live that way , you can ask them . 
  depends a lot on where you go , in no particular order : proper pavements , and pedestrian culture . 
  green , untouched countryside . 
  legal freedom to roam in forests . 
  central heating and properly insulated buildings . 
  four seasons . 
  easygoing mentality and inviting people to your home . 
  eating salads and raw vegetables . 
  black bread . 
  cheese and milk products . 
  not that these things would n't be available at all mind you , but sometimes it 's about price , selection and general availability as well . 
  this . 
  you think to yourself , oh it wo n't be this bad , if i really start missing it i can always bake my own and maybe even show people the tasty beauty that is black bread . 
  you even make sure in advance that you will be able to get all the necessary ingredients , like yeast . 
  and then you go there and realise that not everywhere people have ovens in their kitchens ... 
  latvia because of our similar flags < 3 . 
  myself , i have been to asia multiple times and in middle america once . 
  in my circle of friends , most people spent at least two weeks on some other continent during their university time , or did one or two semesters abroad . 
  i would go as far as saying that among the younger student/hipster crowd , traveling has replaced other forms of status symbols ; nowadays it 's not about cars ( do n't need them ) and definitely not about clothes or smartphones ( people dressed in second hand stuff and used handed-down dumbphones ) anymore , but instead there 's a race going on about who had the most mind-blowing experience while goat-herding in the andes or cooking fugu in japan or cycling across iran . 
  can be cool , but also gets a bit boring when it 's not done for the sake of it , but to show off . 
  and on a totally different note , in my work i have a lot of contact with ... more disfranchised people , and while most of them have actually travelled abroad ( all-inclusive trips to spain , turkey or greece ) , they are definitely lacking the horizon-widening experiences you get from spending some time in other countries and * in * other cultures . 
  my favorite coin is the [ 2 $ from malta ] ( http://www.muenzen.eu/tl_files/bilder/malta/2-euro-malta.gif ) . 
  i also like the ones from [ italy ] ( http://tuscantraveler.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/italian-euro-coins1.jpg ) , because overall they have some of the best looking motifs that also are unique for each denomination ( and therefore , interesting ) . 
  by the way , for people that are interested , i wanted to recommend two android apps that are listing all the coin designs : [ eurik ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.osumsky.eurik ) - ordered by country , great overview over the different series , good for collecting ; [ eurocoins ] ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sk.harho.android.eurocoins ) - ordered by coin value , great for just browsing through the coin designs , including info about the motif . 
  adding to the suggestions for germany - as a kid/ya , i really enjoyed books by michael ende and christine n\u00f6stlinger . 
  oh and also wolfgang hohlbein . 
  after a quick review , i would say amendment six and seven ( trials , prosecution ) seem to be quite important , but of course all of them ( with the exception of the second ) codify very basic rights that thankfully have become the norm in the few hundred years since that document was written . 
  in general , i feel like a little bit of de-cluttering and reorganizing would be in order , some of the amendments seem awfully specific ( like the third , `` quartering of soldiers in peacetime '' ) and have no place in a constitutional document imho . 
  apart from the second amendment ( for obvious reasons ) , i would feel most enthusiastic about changing the tenth , for the sole reason that i feel more centralization and giving more power to the federal level , if done correctly , is a good thing and the us is awfully lacking in that ; a single unified police force would be among the first things i 'd propose . 
  ok , i 'll better stop now before i 'm giving op a heart attack . 
  while not being the preferred way of ingestion , i say it may be , if you feel so inclined . 
  i 'm not that orthodox with my schnitzel it seems . 
  oh - but never when you 're having rice with your schnitzel though , rice and ketchup do n't mix well !, 
  i would n't say * proud * , but i 'm * glad * that i got to grow up in ** one of the top countries concerning quality of life ** . 
  people are rich enough to be comfortable , but laid back enough to not be too workaholic . 
  the country is big enough to matter a bit internationally , but not so big that we 're too much in the spotlight . 
  also everything 's modern and infrastructure makes getting around easy , but there 's still places tucked away where you can enjoy nature and not see a garden or man-made structure for kilometers . 
  apart from that , i 'm * glad * that i 'm living in a city that used to be on the forefront of science , art and culture ( around the fin-de-siecle ) , and that we 're conservative enough to have kept some of the nice stuff from back then around ; in general i 'm * proud * of ** the way modernization happened around here ** , especially when i compare to some of the countries that lost so much of their history when lunging forward . 
  about europe , i have to say i 'm most proud of ** its people , and their capacity for greatness and goodness ** . 
  the fact that , despite all of its violent history , this continent found a way to live together in a ( more or less ) harmonious and prosperous way really gives me hope for mankind 's future . 
  it makes me feel that , even though there might be lots of setbacks in between , that we are getting better at being here . 
  not a museum , but if you want to go check out some of the viennese coffee houses , i can really recommend caf\u00e9 sperl , it 's one of the `` classic '' ones but not touristy at all , very comfortable and not too pricy . 
  stay away from caf\u00e9 landtmann and caf\u00e9 central if you do n't like tourists . 
  oh and if somebody recommends caf\u00e9 ritter after me , do n't mistake the ritter closer to the center ( at mariahilfer stra\u00dfe ; the bad one ) with the other ritter further out of town ( ottakringer stra\u00dfe ; the good one ) . 
  haha , the second part of your comment reminded me of a friend from japan who also had difficulty with some words that are similar except for one letter . 
  karpfen and krapfen comes to mind . 
  i was kinda worried when he came into my room , looked like he was hurting and said `` ich glaube mein kopf schmilzt ! '', 
  great thread !,

  wow , some oc , and in high resolution too . 
  underrated post . 
  it 's things like this why i love this place . 
  another bridge built , from lingonberry jam . 
  oh and just send a message if you end up coming to vienna and need anything !, 
  interestingly , both `` nich '' and '' - ste '' sound jarringly northern down here , and it does n't look like that 's going to change anytime soon . 
  pluricentric language and all that . 
  thanks for that great explanation ; lautwandel and its local differences are super interesting . 
  earliest memory i have of being read books to is of pixie picture books , j\u00e1nos , and little frederick . 
  after that , i asked for stories from the mickey mouse magazine ( mostly the duck stuff ) until i could read that and lucky luke/asterix & obelix myself . 
  at the same time , books by lindgren ( mio , mein mio/mio , my son ) and michael ende ( jim knopf/jim button , momo , night of wishes ) . 
  in my youth , i read lots of christine n\u00f6stlinger ( wolf saga !, 
  i 'm very thankful to my parents . 
  getting up to get some water , then go lie down again until the room stops spinning . 
  saturday morning sports ... people these days . 
  friend works at mcd 's , i asked . 
  apparently , they do n't break that often , but once they do , it takes a long time to fix . 
  last time their machine was out , it took 8 days to fix it , because the technician could n't come earlier . 
  so it might be a problem with the producer/their service contract ? 
  this is austria btw , other countries might differ . 
  hmm good question . 
  i think geopolitically , a time with one strong hegemon is more peaceful than one where a lot of countries are racing each other to come out on top ( in military strength , economically , culturally ) . 
  in that regard , i miss the times of the us as the sole `` world police '' . 
  on the other hand , you have to stand behind your own claims , and it 's become more and more clear how the us really has no moral authority whatsoever to ask anybody to be a better country , i think . 
  on an additional note , i think it 's easy to overstate the importance of your own country , when seeing the world through its own media . 
  this is the part where i have to admit having had that egocentristic world view a bit myself : if you go abroad , you 'll notice there 's literally hundreds of millions of people who do n't give a damn about your own `` way of life '' ( being from the west myself , i had that experience when going to asia ) . 
  on the surface , sure , everybody knows coca cola . 
  but surprisingly , people do n't strive to `` reach up '' to that shining example of western culture , as our own exceptionalism would make us believe . 
  deep down , where it matters , we 're not as important as we think we are , and oddly that 's a comforting thought . 
  [ ulm ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ulm ) , i think . 
  i just learned it has a bit more than 50k inhabitants , but it has that nice small-town feel to it , as well as the danube at just the right size , and relaxed and friendly people . 
  spent a great time there !, 
  sadly , yes .
