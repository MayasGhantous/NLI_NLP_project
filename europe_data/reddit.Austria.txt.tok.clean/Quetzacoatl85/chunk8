  this is just a small trivia tidbit , but i remember reading on the news that a bridge handrail collapsed because of the added weight of the locks . 
  happened a few years ago , maybe in italy/france ? 
  hope it helps . 
  not a european language , but here 's one i learned from japanese friends : sumomo mo momo mo momo no uchi . 
  ( `` japanese plums and peaches are both in the peach family . '' ), 
  ( it gets a bit better when written in japanese script , since then it does n't all look the same : \u3059\u3082\u3082\u3082\u6843\u3082\u6843\u306e\u3046\u3061 ), 
  this post does a great job at answering the question ; i fully agree and have nothing further to add . 
  - stop it with american exceptionalism . 
  perceive yourself as one country out of many , and realize that not everybody is striving to `` reach '' where the us are . 
  - get a better banking system , then get rid of credit cards . 
  i 'm talking about free , next-day online wire transfer , automatic deductions and getting rid of cheques and signing when paying by card ( use pin instead ) . 
  also , realize that credit card companies are a middle man that contributes * nothing * to the payment process , apart from leeching off merchants and people that are bad with credit . 
  yes , this is also what pays your cash-back and flyer miles and other stuff designed to keep you happy . 
  - have price tags include all taxes . 
  and no , differing taxes between states/cities does not count as an excuse - if a store/branch can stock its racks , it can also print and apply the correct price tag ; or even better , it can use electronic tags . 
  - get fully tax-funded health care and education systems . 
  up to and including university level . 
  - less energy wasting , more green energy . 
  smaller and lighter cars ( silently kill of the suv ) , less air-conditioning ( in offices , it can be * so cold * ) , more solar/wind power . 
  - get a public transportation system , improve situation for pedestrians ( in some areas ) . 
  pavements , people !, 
  and a modern and fast train system . 
  [ the village next to mine ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/stiefern.jpg/326px-stiefern.jpg ) in austria , along the kamp river , in one of the most forested/backwards parts of the country . 
  i like it there though . 
  austrian german : drah di haam !, 
  ( go have a look at the radishes from below ), 
  hahaa , love viennese and its inventive expletives for that : toss yourself over the houses !,

  i think i spider . 
  you dizzy cocoa stirrer , this makes me have such cables , and makes my disgust pear rise . 
  recommending caf\u00e9 sperl , it 's my favorite out of the classical coffee houses , and not touristy like caf\u00e9 central ( which can also be nice though ) . 
  also caf\u00e9 phil , serving a more hip and young crowd , is right across the street as well . 
  [ ferdinand i ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ferdinand_i_of_austria ) ( ruler of austria and later also hungary , 1835-1848 ) , also called ** ferdinand der g\u00fctige ( ferdinand the benevolent ) ** . 
  due to various issues - his epilepsy , perceived incompetence , and being influenced by a group of shadow rulers ( `` geheime staatskonferenz '' ) which included metternich and others - people were not too fond of him , and turned that into ** `` g\u00fctinand der fertige '' ( g\u00fctinand the worn out ) ** . 
  [ the whole region of europe ] ( https://youtu.be/gbahpnd2qjg ) - well-known , but in a version i really like : slow and silent at the beginning , but oh so great once people realize how great it is to stand united in friendship !, 
  [ vienna ] ( https://youtu.be/13agyullk24 ) - there 's just nothing better to describe vienna , its people and their spirit : `` we had , we could , alas - we do n't . '', 
  underrated comment, 
  austria : just a bunch of italians that think they are germans . 
  interestingly , this geographic description manages very well to capture our mentality of `` things should be done properly and everything should be in order !, 
  unless it 's a lot of work . 
  then ... 
  naah . '', 
  sieghart , friedbert , helmfried , stahlhelm .

  on a more serious note , i find the male given name wolf sounds very manly .

  as somebody taking classes in landscape ecology , i 'm interested, 
  austria : kern - no constituency . 
  he was chosen by his party ( sp\u00d6 ) as the follow-up to the last chancellor of the same party ( faymann ) , who stepped down after a bad turnout at the presidential election . 
  beyond good & evil represent !, 
  best character design in any game , ever . 
  still waiting for part deux ... , 
  first , what 's called libertarian in the us is called liberal over here in europe ( while what you call liberals we would just call left-wing if i 'm understanding it correctly ) . 
  in austria we have a relative recent party founding around liberal values , the [ neos ] ( https://partei.neos.eu/ ) . 
  during the [ last election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_legislative_election,_2013 ) , they reached 4.96 % of the vote . 
  there have been a few liberal movements before that ( [ lif ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_forum ) etc. 
  ) , but they never amounted to much . 
  liberals are generally seen as the `` young '' christian-conservatives , that means they share the same `` pro economy , pro deregulation '' message , but without the conservatives ' `` anti gay marriage , conservative family values '' package . 
  thank you . 
  whiny people , and how far removed from the world we feel as a country . 
  seriously , it feels like the fucking shire here sometimes , full of hobbits that do n't know how good they have it . 
  case in point , just yesterday i was reading an article on how roaming charges in europe will be dropped completely starting from middle of next year . 
  you would think that in the comments , people maybe would be happy about that change ; maybe they would talk about their next trip abroad , or even express appreciation about how close we have grown on this awesome continent of security and culture and prosperity . 
  call me crazy , but they could even show appreciation for the fact the eu bureaucracy is finally * working for them * , and doing something totally great and consumer-oriented while opposing short-sighted national government interests !, 
  but no , of course people are just complaining that a ) they do n't go abroad so often so they ca n't see the sense in it , b ) complain about how they 're afraid that normal charges will start rising ( while having one of the lowest price levels for telekom services in europe ) , or c ) accuse politicians of just doing this for their own benefit and for their own measly phone bills . 
  i mean , come on people , what do you even want ??!, 
  what kind of news would you need to broadcast to * not * trigger those whiny bastards that are only happy when they can tell everybody how unhappy they are ? 
  seriously , living in a third world country for a year should be mandatory , that would show those entitled little shits . 
  ooh i 'm so looking forward to the complete ban !, 
  one more year unfortunately , then i can finally go and visit all those bars and caf\u00e9s i could n't go to so far , leave money there and prove the whiny restaurant owners that got us into this mess wrong ... being afraid of less customers , as if people would just start staying home !, 
  can confirm university , always herr/frau professor , no exceptions . 
  throwing in a few movies with austrian feeling here : glawogger 's trilogy about sex , drugs , and rock 'n' roll ( which he could n't see the finish of before his untimely death ) : [ nacktschnecken ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3shewvdqtpu ) and [ contact high ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bghg7nlzefm ) ( have n't seen hotel rock 'n' roll yet ) ; other good ones that have the awesome austrian movie tradition of `` uh-oh , i 'm not really sure where we 're going with this ... let 's give it a really abstract and pseudo-philosophical ending '' : [ der unfisch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iulvjvtkwfm ) , [ hinterholz 8 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfeohcgji7m ) , [ poppitz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_voavpc2x4 ) , [ indien ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w2evxej_ui ) , [ die drei herren ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aczjbridstq ) ; also they 're usually morbid , and showing underdogs having nonsensical conversations , love it . 
  a few newer ones are [ der knochenmann ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dabtmdfjjj0 ) and [ free rainer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eo6r5un9yk ) ( although the last one is arguably german ) . 
  also , wow the quality of austrian trailers on youtube is atrocious . 
  posting it for people interested , here 's a ( secret ) [ recording of hitler talking in his normal voice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oet1wag5sfk ) . 
  it is the only known recording of hitler speaking in an unofficial tone and one of the very few recordings in which hitler may be heard delivering a narrative without raising his voice . 
  you will have fun trying to wrap your head around places like indonesia/china/india .

  austria : [ result of presidential election 2016 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/bundespr%c3%a4sidentenwahl_%c3%96sterreich_2016_1._runde.svg ) between right-wing candidate hofer ( blue ) and left-wing candidate van der bellen ( green ) , as well as some others . 
  now try guessing which areas are cities . 
  big divide , especially politically . 
  love the anthems , most importantly , the [ european hymn ] ( https://youtu.be/gbahpnd2qjg ) !, 
  - because it automatically builds a barrier between you and others , you ca n't have emphasis on the `` we '' without separating yourself from the `` you '' - because it gives off a `` we are better than others '' vibe - because it does n't make sense to be proud of something you just got lucky to be born into , and had no part in making what it is today, 
  ooh , tell him about the * einsp\u00e4nner * and * kapuziner * next !, 
  i 've come to love the kapuziner lately , and am always excited when the caf\u00e9 i 'm at has it in their menu ... 
  what are the two groups ? 
  you 're right on the money with your observations , just wanted to add a clarification about the asian tourist swarms : there 's a big difference between chinese/japanese ( and korean , although not so much ) tourist groups . 
  try and make it into a game of `` guess which country they 're from '' next time ; you 'll find that the obnoxious ones are from china most of the time , while japanese tour groups are super polite and aware of their surroundings at best and kind of cute at worst . 
  1 . free to send in/to other countries 2 . can send pictures/sound files 3 . app allows me to use the nice apple emoji and not their ugly android counterparts honestly , no . 
  3 was my main reason for switching ( since i had just switched from an iphone when w.a. 
  became popular ) ; and no . 
  1 +2 are my main reasons for staying with it, 
  i really like this one : [ es wird scho gleich dumpa ] ( https://youtu.be/dr7mqq5khhw ),
