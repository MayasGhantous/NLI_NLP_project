  i think we have watch lists which ping if somebody enters a country and i am also pretty sure we do have a black list for criminals who got convicted and deported . 
  visa free travel does n't help terrorists a tiny bit , they already manage to get here via other routes and most perpetrators were eu-citizens . 
  also visa free does n't mean border controll free .

  vienna - linz was like 6 hours , nowerdays it is 1 hour , anybody want to look up other comparisons ? 
  sure but the title of the article talks about a dirty nuclear bomb ... 
  well , we try to be as fast as possible , but we still need more mods . 
  please remember the rules , we are acticly modding the thread . 
  if you see any comments that break the rules please report it and we try to get to it asap . 
  also it is much harder than it sounds to replace any culture unless you want to stoop to genocide which gets you evil eyes from the rest of the world . 
  planing for the worst , hoping for the best . 
  is n't a nuclear bomb always dirty ? 
  i am pretty sure that they are punished when they are caught , but this is little help to the people who already fell victim to an assault . 
  just banned him , he should probably rename himself to `` the_banned_one '' .

  glory hole and all that  .

  we got a lot of reports in this threads , please remember the rules !, 
  yes , we know that sometimes tempers run high and that this woman is stupid and so on but please stay civil . 
  ninja edit : please report anything you think breaks the rules . 
  why ? 
  because what the nazis did was also `` only '' removing dangerous people form society and while i agree that people are terrorists or plan such attacks must be jailed and so on , what he said sounded a lot like thought police , at least the top comment . 
  what you are proposing is dangerously close to genocide . 
  please refrain from personal attacks . 
  you went quite a bit overboard .

  there are almost always groups who are not fully integrated into society but generally it lessens over time . 
  not integrating is obviously bad and we should try to integrate them as much as possible but at the same time we should n't force people to do what they do n't like as long as it is n't against the law . 
  about your dream of the perfect socity , i think it is impossible to obtain but it is always good to work for a better , fairer society . 
  minus religous plus a lot of popularity . 
  well , those papers are at the same level as fox news . 
  well there is such a right of freedom of religion and self determination and in my opinion they are welcome to perpetuate their culture as long as they do n't break any laws . 
  i would n't be so sure about it , especially with `` newspapers '' like dailymail , thesun , bild and a ton of other rather low quallity papers . 
  i do n't think newspapers are reporting about well integrated people .
