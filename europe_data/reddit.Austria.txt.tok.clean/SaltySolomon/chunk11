  well , there are still people who follow the old testament hardcore , however the mainstream sees the many contradictions in it and focuses on the positive messages of it . 
  i think the same should be possible for muslims . 
  yeah , it is almost always a difficult line to walk especially when people call for blood after terrorist attacks . 
  nowerdays , yes but christinaty in the past and even nowerdays ( in certain areas around the world ) are n't saints . 
  i believe that with time many muslims will read the koran as that what it is , a product of its time and see it more as a general guideline than a steadfast rulebook . 
  that is a question that will be asked of course . 
  however as a person studying it-security i can tell you that there is not such a thing as perfect security and that at some point you are sacrificing so much that you loose more in freedom and democracy than you gain in security . 
  i do n't think anybody here disagrees that islam does have its ugly sides but so does chrisianity and what israel is doing in the name of judaism is n't great either ... 
  as soon as greece gets over the naming conflict ... 
  you will probably not get one , however people who do n't like it here will probably want to return home and those who want to stay here will probably apply for citizenship . 
  the mod police was called ? 
  yes , sergant , please ban this troll !,

  okay , sorry but as an austrian the comparison is just straight up dumb ... 
  so you argue that `` white collar '' crimes like ceos emabzaling millions should be treatet better than `` blue collar '' crimes like burglary or petty theft ? 
  one could argue that the civil war was a split where parts where governed by another `` country '' . 
  please reply to me for additional information or send me a message so that i can append this post !, 
   [ / r/syriancivilwar livethread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/4a8zj4/breaking_explosion_in_ankara_k%c4%b1z%c4%b1lay_casualties/ ) post by / u/911mitdidit [ link ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4a92a4/explosion_in_central_ankara_explosion_in_kizilay/d0ydel3 )  they say that at least 10 people died . 
   https://twitter.com/140journos/status/709067369675689984  who is responsible ? 
  no clue . 
  turkish intelligence is too busy suing people who insult erdogan . 
   edit : its a volkswagen scirocco again like the previous attack . 
   https://twitter.com/hasavrat/status/709075897693958144  edit : its confrimed that 27 people died and 75 injured . 
   for more updates ( ki\u015fi = person , yaral\u0131 = injured ) and footages :  http://www.cnnturk.com/canli-yayin  http://www.haberturk.com/canliyayin  edit : another footage . 
  i 'm afraid the casualities are more than what the governer reported . 
   https://twitter.com/istanbul_indy/status/709079905976369153 update : 34 civilian deaths and 125 wounded, 
  we are consolidating all talk about the event in the following thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4a92a4/explosion_in_central_ankara_explosion_in_kizilay/ please use the thread above !, 
  well , i might point out that we got 4 us tz mods now , so it is completly beside the point . 
  wait , there is a poland ball ? 
  finally somebody pointing out that europe is n't completly going down the drain  . 
  i think we are currently falling into the trap for newspapers of bad news is good news .

  to get around the paywall : http://www.froomens.com/posts/the-economist-paywall-bypass-bookmarklet/ text of the article : throughout the cold war , turkey was one of europe 's bastions against soviet armies . 
  now it is being turned into europe 's barrier against the huddled masses of the middle east . 
  at a summit on march 7th , european leaders and the turkish prime minister , ahmet davutoglu , agreed on the outline of a strikingly ambitious deal .
