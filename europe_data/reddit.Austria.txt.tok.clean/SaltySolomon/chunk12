  turkey will take back all the boat-people setting off from its shores to greece . 
  in return , europe is promising lots of things : money ; the resettlement of many refugees now in turkey ; visa-free travel for turks ; and a revival of negotiations for turkey to join the european union . 
  every element of the arrangement is politically , legally or morally problematic . 
  to make matters worse , the behaviour of the turkish president , recep tayyip erdogan , is increasingly autocratic : the weekend before striking the accord with the eu , his government took over a prominent opposition newspaper . 
  but europe is doing the right thing . 
  the deal 's principles are sound ( and have , indeed , been advocated by this newspaper ) : it would control chaotic mass-migration while preserving a generous european asylum system , and enlist turkey as a gatekeeper by binding it more closely to europe . 
  it offers the best prospect of ending the uncontrolled influx that has been feeding anti-immigrant populism and undermining eu integration . 
  and it provides a way for europe to seek mr erdogan 's co-operation without flinching from criticising him . 
  most of the 1.2 m migrants who arrived in the eu last year came via turkey . 
  donald tusk , president of the european council , had been negotiating a deal whereby asylum-seekers would be sifted on arrival in `` hotspots '' in greece and italy , and those rejected would be sent back to turkey . 
  the new scheme , championed by the german chancellor , angela merkel , is a more ambitious arrangement -- all boat-people would be sent back to turkey and processed there . 
  this would avoid turning greece into a refugee camp , offer a stronger disincentive to illegal migration and ensure that europe grants protection to the most deserving , not those most able to pay people-smugglers . 
  but lawyers and un agencies are already questioning the legality of mass deportation , which would require europe to declare turkey a `` safe '' country for asylum-seekers . 
  for all its generosity to syrians , turkey formally applies the 1951 convention on refugees only to those fleeing war or persecution in europe . 
  unless turkey can bring its asylum system up to international norms , the eu may have to fall back on mr tusk 's original plan . 
  either way , europe will have to be generous to refugees -- it has promised to take one syrian from turkey for every one that is sent back from greece -- though it still can not agree how to share them out for resettlement . 
  visa liberalisation will be contentious , too . 
  turkey is the only eu candidate country not to enjoy visa-free travel already . 
  the biggest obstacle , a framework for turkey to take back illegal migrants , would be addressed by the new deal . 
  but turkey has yet to meet many of the eu 's 70-odd preconditions , including the introduction of biometric passports . 
  and while a deal may limit the influx of syrians , afghans and others , freer travel would inevitably increase the migration of turks into the eu . 
  hardest of all will be any discussion of turkey 's accession to the eu . 
  not even turkey 's closest friends would claim that it meets the democratic standards required to begin eu negotiations , let alone gain membership . 
  mr erdogan would dislike the constraints and scrutiny that membership would bring . 
  so europe should call his bluff by opening the two accession chapters that mr erdogan least wants to discuss -- chapters 23 and 24 , on justice and the rule of law . 
  it should also press turkey to do more to support talks on the reunification of cyprus . 
  ultimately , europeans must come to terms with two realities . 
  first , they can not change geography : they need turkey because it stands between europe and much of the eurasian landmass . 
  second , they can not seal their borders entirely : the only alternative to chaos is a fair and orderly migration system , which would most benefit europe -- and those fleeing war . 
  this week 's proposed deal is messy , but it is europe 's best option . 
  well , than he will probably get kicked out again ... 
  we where just answering an `` if '' question , nothing much will happen there , the guy hopefully learned his lesson of not being an racist idiot and the whole thing does n't have to be repeated . 
  in my opinion he is an mep so that is punishment enough to be kicked out of your own house ( even if it is only for the session )  . 
  certainly , if his immunity would be removed by the ep .

  to be honest i rather have people coming together and make compromises that are good enough than something redicoulus happening like in hungary and poland . 
  probably a mixture of both , with the new technology helping to convince to change the planning laws . 
  also london is getting really crowded and any more space that can be created is needed ( in addtion to improving public transport by a lot ) . 
  but how is that different from the parlament of every country where regional interestes get diluted ?

  what a suprise , i think we are living in a time of polarisation , it is incredibly hard to walk the middle path , we as the mod team are trying to do it but it gets us amosity from both sides . 
  well , i also am annoyed at people if they say that you have to be racist because else you are pc . 
  well , it is n't just that comment , also just have a look at his comment history : / . 
  i think it is very difficutl for the extreme right groups to organise because while we put them in the same pot , they all are different , there arer the somewhat neo-nazi groups like the austrian fpo , the anti-eu anti immigration ukip and the super anti-semitism of that french party . 
  they are all so much against people from other countries that they do n't like each other . 
  well , i think that a good ammount of pc is needed in our society if we do n't want straight out racism and gang wars to happen but rather to work together and live side by side . 
  i also think that the semi-anoymity on the internet makes it worse , you do n't have to fear any judgement by your peers about it . 
  i can certainly understand the fear of loosing your job due to immigration , however i think is overblown a tiny bit . 
  i think that is actually a great design , unless you are afraid some idiot throws a bomb thru the window : /, 
  also border checks can be annoying when you travel by car , i once had to wait 4 hours on a really hot day on a dam border . 
  i just banned the guy for that comment , we do n't need any white power guys on the subreddit : / .

  well we could just make another proposal , you either take the refugees or you pay for the refugees in another country .

  commison : indirectly elected by the european parlament the european council : but ministers where elected by the members of parlament -  so they are representatives of their parlament . 
  the eurogroup is an informal working group of top politicans 2 . 
  the european council : consists of the goverments of europe , those where democratically elected . 
  commision : indirectly elected , the same holds true for every goverment in europe !, 
  make a self post with the joke with x-post in the title and a np link in the comments or the selfpost . 
  i doubt it that that post is the original source ... 
  but as you might have noticed in the case the maps are linked and not the subreddit where the maps where posted . 
  well , it is a subreddit about europe not a subreddit about other subreddits that make jokes about europe . 
  linking to another subreddit , not cool, 
  i agree with you it is really painless to do anything with another business in the eu , as soon as you get outside it gets painfull . 
  so you say we need an eu army ?
