  well , they will feel in the purse at the next greece bailout ... is my proposed solution perfect , of course not , but at least it is a doable solution . 
  i think the only way is to distribute all people who claim asylum across the eu , once they got accepted or denied they can move to whatever country they want ( there could be limits , but we can talk about those later ) this way it would take of the weight curshing greece . 
  generally i can not see how the eu can continue without a common refugee/asylum system . 
  i already had the argument with somebody else on this subreddit , comparing the eu with the udssr is straight up wrong :( . 
  udssr was completly on central controll , while the eu is much more democratic and every country has a say . 
  will you always get what you want , of course not and sometimes you will have to swallow the toad but other times you will get what you want and another has to swallow the toad . 
  i am just removing the post , no hard feeling else , sadly one can not change links on reddit once submitted .

  no advertisment please, 
  any benefits of going constitutional republic or constitutional monarchy ? 
  i do n't play the game , so who owns the british isles ? 
  also it is possible that a country is a democracy in the game ? 
  will gb get the chance for a vote on independence in the game too ? 
  no qualms there , it is right to use the original title . 
  i got a report for it being a shitty title , it kinda is but is the one bbc runs with . 
  also : please do n't let this thread sink into a kurds vs. turks slugfest , we will ban you really quickly for personal insults if you do it .

  sweden has a different way of counting plus it is much more likely a woman will report it there do you could say it is the capital of reported rape . 
  moving up from 1 to 3 is also 79 % , small changes can create huge percentages with smaller numbers . 
  i do n't think that anybody denies here that we have somewhat of a crisis on our hands in europe and what pisses me off is that when germany steps up to the plate and tries to offer a solution that would transfer the burden equally to everybody there are countries who basiclly say no without offering any solution themselfes besides `` muh fences '' which is like no solution because border controls are doing heavy damage to the internal market . 
   shaming and putting people out of job who dare to have different opinion ? 
  check ( see the news ) so it should be illeagl to fire somebody who reflects badly on the company -  it is the freedom of a company who to hire and who to fire . 
   imprisoning , torturing and killing people without trial ? 
  check ( us doing it in poland ) i do n't really see how that is connected with the eu -  it was the polish goverment who did it  overthrowing democratically elected foreign governments ? 
  check ( ukraine ) i gona leave this pot of a hot mess alone , there is just so little good and unbiased information , but i might add that a goverment that shoots at is own people has little legitamcy in my eyes . 
   rule of a single party ? 
  check ( corporations bribing both sides of political spectrum ) the eu parlament has probably one of the most variety of parties and oppinions in europe and the eu is a driving force in many ee countries to fight corruption  censorship ? 
  check ( just read the newspapers and how they dont dont allow discussion ) i do n't understand the point newspapers are always biased and present one viewpoint , you always have to read multiple ones to get closer to the truth . 
   restricting religious freedom ? 
  check ( in canada cops are going to church to check , if priests are not making anti rainbow speeches ) do n't really see how this is connected to the eu either , also with your awesome religous freedom scientology is a great religion ...  no freedom of speech ? 
  check ( we tell you what free speech is , or else its prison or point 1 . ), 
  `` true '' freedom of speech does n't exist anywhere in the world except maybe a dark cave where you alone . 
  if there would be true freedom of speech child pornography would be legal . 
  also freedom of speech is only a thing in relation to the goverment . 
  you are free to say what you want but you will also have to live with the consequences  media being mouthpiece of the communist party ? 
  check ( mouthpiece of few multinational corporations , which own all the political parties ) again , if you only take your information from one source you will get some biased information , depending on the source better or worth . 
  also there are quite a number of public broadcasters and newspapers would are quite independet in europe . 
  well , the eu is a political union and trade is just a part of it . 
  and comparing the eu with the udssr ... 
  i can not even start how that is comparing apples to oranges . 
  also the brunt force of the relocation would bare germany and other richer eu states while helping poorer states on the front line like italy and greece . 
  i also might point out that poland looks like a child who wants his cake and eat it too and complains it can not do it and that it is unfair . 
  a couple hundred = hundreds of thousands / s also to be honest why not kick out all the poles and so on out of the uk and germany those people went there against the will of the population ... 
  so basically having a veto on everything and representation is dictating and only if you do n't like the results ... 
  i think that merkle would jump at even this proposal but the v4 are against anything and everything and greece does n't want any help because then they would have to admit that their entire asylum system failed . 
  i do n't think that is merkles fault , it is more that certain other members of the eu ( v4 and greece ) are very uncoperative in finding a workable solution . 
  just to chime in , but france liberal and friendly to foreigners , in what world are you living ? 
  i hope you are sarcastic . 
  it is more local crime news that just gets shortend to local news . 
  some people asked why this is not local news . 
  well the short and straight forward answer is that events of this size and magnitude rarely happen -  not local news . 
  edit : that does n't mean you can ignore the rules in the comments , we will keep an special eye on the thread and please report anything you think breaks the rules . 
  i do n't think germany tries to put of the blame , they agree that they are to blame for a lot but what they disagree with is that poland tries to whitewash its history . 
  so we should keep everybody out and not send the half back ? 
  what kind of logic is that ? 
  also it makes sense that the young/strong/male come first and then try to pull their family afterwards it is really expensive to pay the smuggler and really dangerous . 
  i do n't think anybody is sayiing that poland perpetrated the holocaust but at the same time it is wrong to say that polish citizens did never have anything to do with it and that there were n't any colaborators . 
  there are always many who are willing , i know that . 
  austria has a shamefull history in that area . 
  and he is a proffessor at a well know university which gives him also quite a bit of credibility . 
  still does n't mean he is right , history is always a bit murky , but removing and honor awarded because somebody is n't your opinion is just straight up dumb . 
   what does antisemitism revolve around in poland considering there are so few jews ? 
  probably the usual , they are rich and controll the goverment which is rather silly with the current one ... 
  it is really hard to compare prizes because of inflation and time that passed but generally i like the currency a lot and it makes traveling and internet payment so much easier . 
  except that estonia has quite a large minority in the country and it is a pretty small country  . 
  yes , thank you that will surely help you  . 
  you , know the internet rule , pics or did n't happen !,
