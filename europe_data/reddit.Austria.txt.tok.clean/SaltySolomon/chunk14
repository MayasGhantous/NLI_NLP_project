  i think both sides do n't like to debate , the right also are really quick to throw `` insults '' at one if you do n't agree with you . 
  and are n't you also instantly discarding their arguements ? 
  have you ever thought that your view point could be wrong , i mean i think about it every day and i am never really sure what is the right thing . 
  yes it , kinda is , it turns a neutral headline into a klick bait headline because by your argument you would have also had to add the part about in some dutch schools .

  to be honest rt says whatever the kremlin wants it to say and that makes it an incredibly unreliable news source .

  let me gues , you are n't from austria , but you are an expert in austrian newspapers , good to know ... 
  i agree, 
  i did n't say it was right wing , i think you replied to the wrong comment  . 
  i also would n't call it socialist but rather following whatever ideology pays the most . 
  probably wo n't happen max prison sentence is somewhere around 20 years . 
  i would n't call austrian prisons cushy , just google for pictures from them , they are pretty crappy . 
  also the austrian goverment does protect its citizens . 
  they apprenhended the perpetrator and he is now in front of a court . 
  what else do you want ? 
  should the goverment use pre crime and arrest people because they might commit a crime ? 
  the kronenzeitung is quite something specially and it is hard to make somebody understand who is n't from austria . 
  i would n't call it right wing , but rather a news paper that has crappy journailstic quallity and it likes to exploit everything and anything . 
  i do n't say that all reddit users are n't knowlegable but there is a pretty strong hiveminding going on . 
  if i were invaded by another country my tolerance for their soldiers would be also somewhat limited ... 
  actually the kronenzeitung did , but it is the kronenzeitung ... 
  sorry , but it is old news at this point :(, 
  well , we got a lot of armchair generals from all over the world who never were somewhere but declared themselves experts at anything and everything . 
  just because one is wrong , does n't mean the other one is right . 
  wait , britain first , that name of a facebook page is like an instant disqualifier of balanced inforamtion in my eyes . 
  do i say that there are no problems ? 
  of course not but if you want you can nitpick an edit a video that make everything `` real '' . 
  just look at what happend with planned parenthood in the us . 
  about facebook : i do n't like it they are great at creating filter bubbles where you only see the news that you want to see :( . 
  integrieren : to integrate ; german word for being part of a society , finding a home and being a nice person . 
  sadly secondary meaning does n't translate well to text :( . 
  vienna has a ton of immigrants you just do n't really see them , i mean the biggest group are germans  . 
  i think that the state needs to push german classes much harder because without german there is no integration :( . 
  well , retarted is used pretty much always used as an insult . 
  you can say that his idea is retarted and if you edit it to something along those lines i will reapprove it . 
  but where did they get that number ? 
  that is like one prison and it turned into the entire prison system :( . 
  yeah , there are problems and i am not disagreeing with you about it , but i think it could be much worse . 
  the main problem point in my opinion is the 10th tho . 
  yeah , i think one of the things is that you do n't see well integrated people while those who are n't stick out like a sore thumb . 
  and i just approved it for you  . 
  thats because it was done by the kronenzeitung , one of the most unreliable newspapers in austria . 
  no worries we do n't delete comments for saying a rapist is an idiot . 
  we just remove comments for saying fantastic things like `` all muslims are rapists and should be killed '' . 
  i am not 100 % sure about that , but i did some research on that data and i could n't find a single source for that number , which i think is pretty terrible for a `` statistic '' .

  yeah , i am also not a big fan for learning for test . 
  i do n't think one can mandate imigration by law , one can only encourage it and the mayority of the work has to be done in daily live . 
  yes , because it often happens inside families and so on and there is sadly a great shame connected with it . 
  also when the woman go to the police weeks after it is impossible to prove . 
  that the statistic in britain is n't bogus . 
  that statistic is bogus , they took on prison , looked at the names and multplied from there , this is something i would hardly call good statistics . 
  proof please , 
  yeah , there are way to many armchair generals on this subreddit who love to talk shit but do n't actually want to help in any way . 
  i have to disagree , most are really well integrated in austria . 
  i agree , it can be a problem in austria due to a rather conservative society . 
  i think it is getting better tho . 
  in the context of this thread : i think most people are forgetting that most rapes happen in families and by people who know each other but those cases rarely make it to the news . 
  maybe there are n't many rapes ?
