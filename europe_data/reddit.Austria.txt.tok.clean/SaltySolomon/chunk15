  there are no reasons to send syrians back to syria because it is a fricking warzone , but if they wanted they could put them back to greece for all the good that would do . 
  because it is the kronenzeitung , it is the worst newspaper in austria and if you where from austria you would understand .

  sudo apt-get church-upgrade i hope they are security minded, 
  but saying that is because muslims is a bit dumb , i think it is more that they have a support corrupt president who courts extremists and terrorists . 
  how many nations are left ? 
  no worries , we just like to know when you do something like this , you might also want to link to the colum itself so that it gets a few more clicks . 
  hi , yeah round 7 , is there an aar of the last one ? 
  hi , mod here , it is fine that you post it here and such , but it is pretty close to self promotion :( . 
  next time please send a modmail first so we know about it . 
  my statistics professor once said that you should only trust statistics you faked yourself . 
  so i have to agree with you on this one , it is really easy to missrepresent statistics . 
  so if trump says he would save guard american culture , would n't he have to convert to native american religion ? 
  but to be honest the other memberstates werer n't helpfull at all , nobody wanted to share any burden at all . 
  i think he meant it sarcastic ... 
  crimea has one of the few good ports on the black sea and the rest is shadow play imho . 
  i do n't know how it is in the uk but at least in austria it is a long process with psychologists , social workers and judges . 
  it is always very difficult to decide if a child should be taken away . 
  it can be very damaging to the child .

  yellow press what does it relate too , i mean one of the best newspapers in austria is printed on yellowish paper . 
  yeah , but also from the webdesign i was n't expecting anything good . 
  i generally use tabloid as in : print media with questional journalism standards .

  no , we manually review them and approve them by hand .

  i think you forgot an / s. 
  that too  . 
  but love works in mysterious ways  . 
  also in danger of being called a gramar nazi it is `` which non muslim ... '', 
  i am no expert on the koran so i wo n't go into it , but i think just the social stigma would keep a orthodox muslim man from marrying outside his faith . 
  why , so reality is scaremongering now , good for you  . 
  oh please , the last number you quoted me was the one just for goods . 
  there is a bug chunk of financial services which will probably move to in the eu leaving the city in disarray . 
  the number you are quoting is only goods and is n't including services , please look it up on eurostat . 
  that does n't include serivces , so it evens out if you include those . 
  and i do n't think gb would stop importing them and it is a lot easier to replace those services . 
  we probably would do it but i agree with you i do n't see the point of the post and it is off-topic . 
  yep , we usually do best thing is to report those things so that we can deal with them quick .

  please post a translation in english . 
  could you repost it with the exact title of the news article , 
  the deficit is only in goods , it is balanced by services , the total is pretty even . 
  also it is kinda cherry picking , it feels like you want to get all the benefits of being in the eu while not having to follow the rules you do n't like .
