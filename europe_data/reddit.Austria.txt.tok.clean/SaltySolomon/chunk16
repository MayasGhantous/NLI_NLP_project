  i do n't think that this has anything to do with each other  . 
  they are disabeling all the comments on certain topics . 
  sure , i do n't denie that there is no connection , but to be honest the entire part is a huge clusterfuck and nobody is entirely sure who is right . 
  my point is that it is stupid to compare isis with kosovo . 
  yes , and when did kosovo declare independence ?

  i hope i could help you but i can not gurantee another mod wo n't remove it . 
  look i think the only way you could ask a similar question on this subreddit is by neutrally asking about cool subreddits about europe without any direct mentioning of a subreddit in the text post will get removed pretty fast because it is either about / r/europe -  meta or if specifically mentioning another sub it is offtopic/advertisement . 
  that is one of the dumbest thing a politian has ever said , oh well . 
  i mean it is really logical that a small part of a country which voted and made their independece without a war and compare it with raping and pillaging religous fanatics ... 
  up , up , down , down , left , right , left , right , b , a , now you will never catch me , 
  sorry , while funny it is local news :(, 
  just removed the comment and perma banned him , stay here  . 
  because it is n't about europe , but rather about / r/europe , the merits or dismerits of the subreddit 2 . 
  you can not really change anything so that it belongs to this subreddit , like i said , there is / r/europemeta for those kinds of questions . 
  it is breaking the meta rule and to decide what is meta is up to the mods , not you . 
  stop , simply stop , this kind of thread is n't the right one for this subreddit and that is why it was removed . 
  the this is a subreddit about europe rule , 
  if it is n't meta , then it is off topic , either way it will stay removed .

  local news :(, 
  ups , i gues i mixed things up , they are odly similar sometimes , 
  i think around 750.000 subscribers . 
  for meta talk please use / r/europemeta . 
  please stop going at each others throats about everything and randomly reporting things . 
  i also might point out that the denial of the armenian genocide is against this subreddits rules and that you can and will get banned for it . 
  so i gues the us will get locked out of the visa program for schengen ? 
  i generally think it is dumb by the us , if anybody has read their `` questionaire '' he knows what i am talking about .

  just for future reference , what is the newspapers focus ? 
  can anybody tell me anything about the source ? 
  what are its up and downs ? 
  is anybody else getting a ssl-certificate error ? 
  well , we are a geo default for entirety of europe , every account that gets created with an european ip ( sans-uk ) gets subbed to the subreddit . 
  we also get about 1200 subs each day , so ... 
  could you do some nice visulisation of the data , i could send you the data dumb . 
  there should be a list to it , but i sadly can not change it anymore :( . 
  it is accurate for the moment we hit 500.000 subs , which is about two months . 
  why do you need a mirror , i can put one up on imgur if you need one . 
  yes , and then there is the small part that even bothers to do the survey . 
  we generally get around 650.000 uniques a month and around 40.000 a day , this is without requests via the reddit api for mobile apps which is around 50 % of reddits traffic . 
  that is a different subreddit  . 
  i do n't know who their graphics designer is , but he probably should be fired  . 
  a user can still delete his comments , but as moderators we can only `` remove '' the listing of comments and links from our subreddits , they will still show up on a users page . 
  could you please resubmit the article without a capslock title and send a link to the modmail ? 
  removing something on reddit only means unlisting it from the front page of the subreddit .

  inflated in comparison to countries which combine every occurence . 
  if you replace the judges of the constituional court what do you think their judgment will be  . 
  also everybody is talking about it , but nothing else happend so far , in my opinion they broke the common european values which they signed up for when they joined the eu . 
  but i agree lets drink some tea and wait . 
  about the opinion of di fabio , if they pay me 100.000 $ for a paper of course i will agree with their opinion so that they will ask me to write the next one as well  . 
  okay , great he has an opinion , so do i  just because somebody has an opinion does n't mean it is unconstituional . 
  also this is basically just the opinion of the csu , they are currently somewhat in a fight with the cdu to prove that they need to be a seperate party . 
  they made him write that paper to prove their own beliefes . 
  if somebody writes a paper you always have to look at who payed for it . 
  it is rare that a paper diverges from the wishes of the person who ordered it :( . 
  that does n't mean that he is completly wrong , however i would take it with a grain of salt and let something be declared up to the current constitutional court members  . 
  that does n't mean that the goverment did n't try to break the constitution at all , i just remember the `` vorratsdatenspeicherung '' where the constitutional court revoked the law . 
  ntv is not a reliable news outlet , it is pretty much at the same level as cnn . 
  can you link me a reliable source on this ? 
  a ) where is your prove on that and i do n't think the german goverment has much control over the media b ) wtf ? 
  you know there is th echr and the genevea convention which both force signatories , which germany is to proccess everybody who asks for reguee ? 
  i do n't get your point , it is a bit nonsensical , neither countries goverment broke their own constituion in recent memory . 
  hardly , why would germany care if poland turns into another hungary ? 
  hmm , but if you are breaking your own constitution by not following them , are you still democratic ?
