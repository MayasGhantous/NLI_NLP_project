  germany has 860,000 homeless people and acording to your logic they should work out how to give them homes first before they should give any money to hungary ( via eu ) . 
  if everybody is only looking after themselfes we are n't getting anywehere and i am not talking about relalocating people from germany , i am talking about people from greece , a country with 50 % joblessness . 
  nobody is asking hungary to take a billion immigrants , but you are even against taking 4000 , which is like 0,04 percent of your total population . 
  i do n't know how you can call the eu not democratic , there is the ep and pretty much all the important decisions are made by the goverments that are part of the eu , so i do n't get why you call it undemocratic . 
  i locked the thread because it was getting so incredibly off-topic , this is a sub about europe and not about some random universities in america . 
  i know there are some thoughtfull comments and which are on topic but it was getting worse and we are about to hit / r/all which is never helping . 
  edit : apparently it is against , your `` freespeech '' to stop you from going off-topic , if you want to continue if the american universities are breaking the consitution i recommend you to go to / r/news or to whatever other subreddit that has america as its center . 
  i am pretty sure hungary also wants none of the sweet eu money and none of those ugly thing called democracy , apparently they are all in love with their glorious f\u00fchrerer victor orban ... 
  then please argue with me , lets give it a try , please argue with me and read why a differentiated voicing of oppions is a good thing and why saying : `` all muslims are killing children , eat their hearts and are bad people is a bad thing '' is n't a good thing . 
  well , what do you define as free speech ? 
  wow that sounds complicated , were there problems with election fraud in spain ? 
  i mean it would be great if the thread had first estimates and such . 
  i do n't know i will sticky it too if somebody wants to do it . 
  first , thanks a lot for the summary !, 
  i took the freedom to sticky it so that everybody gets up to speed for the election tomrrow . 
  so just one question , would you be ready to do a thread tomorrow that you would update with the results tomrrow ? 
  i am sure you can do it outside the eu ... 
  sure , but that is pretty much done by everybody in the eu and by the eu itself . 
  i think that some kind of resetlment schema will be necessary . 
  i disagree and i think in the longrun it would be much better when we integrate them , will european culture change , sure but when you look into it past it did many times already . 
  whit whose money and then countries would have to give more power to the eu and refugee canps are politically dicy to near impossible because the war is so close . 
  there were a ton of refugees before , they were just out of sight and out of mind in greece . 
  also i am primaryily proposing to resettle them from greece , a country that has a huge financial and political crisis and uk is much better of . 
  do you really think germany created the problem ? 
  i mean there were a lot of refugees on the way and i do n't believe that it increases much , however now everybody has a `` great '' excuse why they are selfish . 
  well , if you look at the refugee numbers the uk are doing very little for it size and proposing things is different from actually helping . 
  sure , never said they are doing anything illegal , just saying i am not happy with them . 
  yeah , and most redditors apparently only read the title and not the article, 
  yeah , i think the current crissis happend because nobody wants to give any power to the eu , even thou it is needed badly . 
  i think it is n't needed to force somebody to register in a certain country , when they are getting redistributed anyways . 
  i am pretty much for giving refuge , but i am also agree that there needs to be identification of everybody who arrives in the eu . 
  at the same time there needs to be a fair distrbution inside the eu ( i am looking at you eastern europe and uk ) . 
  some can , some can not , those wo can not , wo n't comment here  . 
  #faq 1 . 
  am i shadownbanned ? 
  no you 're not . 
  why ca n't i see the comments on a thread ? 
  we do n't know . 
  we ca n't see the comments either .

  why did you ban me ? 
  we did n't , unless you broke a rule 4 . 
  when will reddit return to normal ? 
  we do n't know . 
  why is this happening to me ? 
  i have finals i need to procrastinate for . 
  but really , why is this happening ? 
  one theory is the admins were making popcorn and blew a fuse ... but really we do n't know , the other one is that the bloody americans are simply bad at it . 
  why are the votes acting strangely ? 
  it has something to do with the servers . 
  we do n't totally know . 
  why are only 5 people online / r/europe right now ? 
  it has something to do with the servers . 
  we do n't totally know . 
  your reddit is n't broken !, 
  please do n't use mobile links, 
  i do n't really think that the mayority is anti-immigtation , it is primarily the vocal mayority when we finally manage to publish the survey then you see that most are somewhere in the middle . 
  so mayority should n't rule , well that is news ... 
  there is a simple javascript on the internet , 
  two things , everything venice and the habsburg empire .
