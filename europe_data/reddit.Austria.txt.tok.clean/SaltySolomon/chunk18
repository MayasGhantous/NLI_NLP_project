  i am imagining it a bit like the nra , when anybody says anything against firearms the scream as if it is the end of the world , tell me if i am wrong . 
  to be honest i know some parts sound a bit overkill , but other parts are quite reasonable , like improved tracking of firearms and some better controll of deactivation . 
  i googled the critique you linked and the author is part of the german rifle asscocation and of course they will be against tightening up the controll on firearms . 
  is there anywere where i can read the full proposal and the details of it ? 
  i be honest , i still have to dig a bit deeper into the proposal , but if they want to make it harder to legally own them , then there wo n't be any grandfathering , i mean the reunification was a special case . 
  also we should n't forget that it is only a proposal , currently all the goverments will talk about and the eu parlament will also have a word or two about it . 
  so we should wait till it is an official law proposal and such . 
  with grandfathering the law would be pointless , what probably would happen is that there is a mandatory buy-back program .

  i heared living on the outskirts is pretty nice , but it is pretty expensive . 
  well , what city do you want to got to , ny , la , portland ? 
  that does n't sound too bad , but you have to find an employer first , right ? 
  what are the requirements for a h1b visa like ? 
  have you looked into how ridculously hard it is to get a green card or similar , i think i said it wrong , they might be not afraid , but they dislike it . 
  even with valuable skills it is pretty hard to emigrate to the us , because they are afraid of imigrants . 
  they are an imigrants nation , so got figure ... 
  it is pretty hard to emigrate to the us and switzerland and are n't you doing exactly the same what the asylum seekers are doing ? 
  do whatever you , like where do you want to emigrate to ?

  is n't throwing money at somebody taking matters into your own hand ? 
  we are a geo-default for all new accounts with a european - without uk - ip-adresses , thats why we got a really big european and a relativly small us population . 
  also all we are pretty stringent on the context of europe part .

  it is a bit like shooting your own country in the foot for old industries sake . 
  okay , thanks for pointing it out , it sounded a lot like they did . 
  how can retroactivity be even a thing , any even halve competent laywer will have a fielday suing against it .

  will approve if given a second source . 
  i am no expert on the matter , but i think that those two are a bit comparing apples and oranges , i think the adapting that has to be done is way less when you come from poland than the one that has to be done when you come from africa . 
  but does n't this always happen with minorities , they are often less successful when they imigrate to a country , it is imperative that they learn the countries language and get well integrated . 
  also are you saying that people who are on goverment aid are thieves ? 
  while i think there is a strong corelation between wealth ( or the lack thereof ) and crime , it is sadly not a statistic i was looking for :(, 
  you are probably right , but even if they are n't racist there is the tendency to suspect a certain group , often minoirties first . 
  the statistic is about getting suspected which is n't being convicted . 
  i asked for a statistic about convictions  . 
  well , somepeople like to talk big and hate being asked for prove . 
  i would love to see your statistics . 
  but it is limiting freedom of religion , just sayig that is also a fundemental freedom . 
  yes , 
  i stickied it , because i think it is really interesting what kind of european tv-shows there are . 
  have a look at `` deutschland 83 '' it is a really good show . 
  i have watched borgen which i thought is great , i also really enjoy doctor who and deutschland 83 . 
  dammit , reddit is so slow , 
  no , great news , the eu will have a look at it and there will be a solution be found . 
  well , you brits on the island were always a special case and your weather  but no worries it got pretty cold now and it will probably be are really cold winter . 
  i heared some muslims blew up a castle : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3tr3ll/muslims_blow_up_castle_in_kortjik_belgium_expost/, 
  and 4 days ago we had 23c, 
  i hope they will catch the ones who blew it up !, 
  yesterday we had 16c , at night !, 
  you could run around in a t-shirt . 
  it is n't spring anymore :(,

  most users vote without reafing the article, 
  we generally try to be that way because 1 . ), 
  we are kinda judge , jury and executioner so we have to be carefull what we do 2 . ), 
  internet sources are more often than not semi-reliable . 
  good post , have a upvote . 
  it would be good if we could get a uniform ( ish ) reporting and counting system in europe . 
  the video without context clause :(,
