  to be honest the ecj bascially did n't accept the case because dyson could n't show another way to test vaccum cleaners that has always the same starting conditions and that is reliable .

  can we ask her questions about star wars ? 
  great neutral article , tbh i was first sceptical about the source but after i read it i can only say that it neutrally states the facts and does n't invent anything or sensationalizes anything which is really easy to do with the topic !, 
  there was a post about it a few days ago you are welcome to link to the article , but without linking to a translation service as the main link . 
  sorry , we got a lot of posts the last few days about this topic , also do n't link to google translate , link to the article and offer the translation in the comments . 
  just a question , could the house of lords block it , i know that the rules are pretty arcane , so thats why i am asking . 
  they do , it is called teenager  . 
  also i do n't know exactly how it works but i think that all unaccompanied asylum seekers under 18 have speciall protections acording to the unchr, 
  that looks like a translation issue , but i think it is probably used for people under 18 . 
  you lost all credibility about 2 posts ago . 
  well , let me just learn swedish in a second to gratify a troll , be back in a year to continue the discousion / s. 
  how exactly do you judge that ? 
  human growth end normally somewhere around 16-17 and i do n't know why you got the word children into your mind ? 
  i do n't believe you . 
  they are under 18 , that is the deffiniton of an underage , he never said that they were kids . 
  i am on mobile , please use modmail, 
  well , i do n't think that it will get better over time when everybody learns how to apply for funds and some intelligent people get together to plan usefull projects !, 
  also that sweet eu money should help with getting out of poverty . 
  you can always hope  and if there are enough protests , 
  but were n't there some removals of immunity in the past ? 
  also is it possible to sue somebody after they left parlament ? 
  but it should be easier to remove his immunity now that he is n't pm anymore . 
  i mean it is less politically dicey . 
  sorry , misckicked :( also could you in future use the full link , shorteners are confusing :(, 
  are there any reliable journaistic sources for this ? 
  or any second source that can confirm this ? 
  if either one is true then i will aprrove it . 
  i know i am sorry , we really love to have to hunt down sources and we do n't have anythinh else to do with our sad lifes :(, 
  okay , thanks, 
  it just so that we do n't get drive by random statistics posted . 
  sorry , but the op has to do it . 
  op , please post the source , else i will have to remove it .

  cheers , your inner ego . 
  we do n't know the final content of ttip yet so it is impossible to make any questions about the trade deal . 
  in comaprison to most european goverments ( that includes the uk one ) the eu is incredibly transperant and very efficient with its funds . 
  tbh , there would be so many different possible answers it probably would fill pages :(, 
  the refugee camp has gotten much better since the austrian goverment got their act together . 
  i answered it somewhere else already , survey will stay up for 14 days .

  we will release the data when the survey is closed . 
  well we will garther data and have a look at it and decide what to do . 
  then put him at 4 or so , those are like the extremes . 
  thanks ,

  we will keep it up for like 14 days .
