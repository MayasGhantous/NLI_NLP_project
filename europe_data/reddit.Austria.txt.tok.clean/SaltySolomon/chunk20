  if i.e. 
  uk leaves it would set a terrible precident for the country ( a country that unilateraly breaks agreements ) but it would more or less sever all ties of the uk with eu countries and they could get sued for a lot of things which they would have to pay for too . 
  we also got one , although the lite version of it . 
  still was n't fun and they arrested pretty much everybody and everyone who got even close to the nazi-party . 
  could you tells how you created the table ? 
  they are the most visible , but they can not push decisions alone .

  some new questions but the basic statistics question stayed the same . 
  yeah , it is a pretty bad newspaper . 
  :( it is like the daily mail of austria . 
  ahm , sure i removed the flag . 
  well , it is a bit like saying that there is only one gun law in north america , so it is a bit of a misleading title , had no better flair tho , so that what i used , we now have a `` slightly missleading title '' flair , rejoice !, 
  are there different laws by the cantons ? 
  is this the procdure for the entierty of switzerland ? 
  sure , but somebody has to pay for the inspections and normally taxis need a higher insurance coverage . 
  i think you do n't want to see the value of open borders , 
  you mean putin gave putin the power to do it ? 
  winning , you mean second place ?
