  well , i am a moderator , but i am not really moderating much becaues most subs are really small and the contents come from the mods + they are art subreddits with very simple uncontentious rules . 
  plus it is a network similiar to the sfwnetwork and i am in a senior position ( read i am doing a lot of updating ) there so i am added to every sub of the network , but more often than not i am doing housekeeping . 
  you mean unless the lobbiest say it should be changed ? 
  what you mean that russians do n't approve of putin and his goverment ?
