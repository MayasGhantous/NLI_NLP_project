  nope , there are enough cases where people get thrown out when they move to a country without being able to support themself . 
  however once you are in a country and work there for some time you are entitled to more rights and protections . 
  so if you spend 8 years working in a country , paying taxes , social security and what else you are obviously also entitled to receive the benefits of it . 
  freedom of movement has some bending already build in . 
  things like that you have to be able to support yourself and that if you are doing illegal stuff you can get kicked out . 
  what uk basically wants is to break it by treating eu citizens like 3rd country citizens while getting special treatment for theirs o.o, 
  if i have to get pre approval by some birocrat if i am allowed or not to live in a country i would n't call it freedom . 
  also , i would n't call breaking a freedom completly is only bending ... 
  but does n't gb also bend rules with things like still having the pound , the rabat , eu treaties have a ton of asterixes ... 
  please mark your nsfw images that way .
