  of course , you want a currency that is n't prone to dumbstering , 
  if the price is right i would sell it ofc , i mean double or triple the nominal sharevalue and i would be in ^ ^, 
  if they just want to steal them then for sure , but if they buy them out for a fair value i do n't see why not .

  well , if you beat somebody below us then you get relativly low elo which is the only thing that you can do if you have the highest ^ ^ -  the rate of max elo is limited to the ammount of players in a group .

  damm , that is a bit too violent for me , where does latvia get their finance ministers ? 
  well , i think it is n't possible to calculate elo that way when they play in seperate groups because elo is calculated in conjunction with your oponnents , if there are more ore more better oponents it is easier to get higher elo .

  also people who drink alcohol should n't get surgery because it is also a , abeit legal , drug ... 
  most propaganda has a kernel of truth ... 
  during the important phases there was no poland : /, 
  that part is a grey area and it tries to be avoided but generally eu treaty law and by extention eu-law is above even consitutional law . 
  ireland allows voting on changes to said eu-treaty tho because any changes have to be ratified by all members and every country can decided how it is done , which is usually based on the countries constituion . 
  well , imho the difference is that : a. france was a member of the coalition that won the war b. 
  the goverment of france fled to uk and so it was not interrupted c . the whole forbidding to call them death camps and wanting to execute the law in foreign countries makes poland look incredibly closeminded . 
  i mean own up to it , austrians did also a lot of bad shit and there was a resistance too . 
  so people from syria are n't refugees ? 
  sure not same size , but it would be great to only pay 0,0005 % taxes . .

  well , i just banned the guy for it , i mean he is probably an 10 year old who thinks he is edgy and reads breitbart because everything else is `` l\u00fcgenpresse '' . 
  of course it is , it is the same as handing one company 13 billion , please learn math substracting something negative yields a positive result . 
  general tax cuts are n't but imagine only one company does n't have to pay 13 billion in taxes , they would now have 13 billion more . 
  of course aid is given , to be more preciesly 13 billion euros . 
  it is like giving somebody 13 billion worth in tax credits .
