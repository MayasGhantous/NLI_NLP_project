  sorry , you do n't meet our minimum account age . 
  sorry , your account is too young :(, 
  weeks ago there was a change to the subreddit and there was a sticky about it . 
  we removed a lot of shadowbans because they had no reason attached and a lot of bans of the last month because a mod overstepped his bounds and was drunk and did a lot of stupid stuff . 
  i think / r/askeurope and the country subreddits are better places to ask . 
  there is nothing unified about how it works . 
  it has a faster turnover and news articles are still allowed to be posted normally . 
  so please tell , what is an average person ? 
  but not the grammar , that `` i '' should be big  . 
  i think ireland is a bit better because it is not obvious you are doing tax avoidance . 
  but maybe it is just that nobody sees those companies . 
  i mean i imagine it as a distributer between postage services . 
  hmm , i do n't think so , should we as the eu ? 
  do you have a couple million euros ? 
  because then i propose a buisness , 
  please post it in eli5 or / r/askeurope, 
  i propose multiple pan european shipping companies . 
  or companies who are doing the cross country shipping . 
  and i just banned him , so if he show up again ... 
  please refrain a bit from annoying greece , we know they are going through a difficult time . 
  you have to replace the www with np , so np.reddit.com, 
  could you tell us a bit about your special codex ?

  okay , but how does one end up with a million ? 
  that would have been about 200.000 children per person ?

  please keep it civil . 
  maybe because sexual assaults normally happen by people the minor knows ? 
  no personal attacks please . 
  \u00c4hm , no, 
  please use np.reddit.com links !, 
  for gods sake , it is the daily mirror ... 
  but what exactly would you change ? 
  how would you moderate in a less biased way ? 
  i meant submit a new post with this link :d, 
  if you have any concerns , please send a modmail . 
  please post the link directly to the news site . 
  look cool down both of you accusing everybody of everything never helped anybody , relax enjoy the beautifull evening and take a break . 
  please do n't go around accusing someone of being a kremlin shill without at least some facts as basis . 
  i think the suffocated . 
  so who is included and what are the definitions of everything ? 
  are asylants allowed to work whatever they want ? 
  it is summer break , nothing much happening here . 
  proof please, 
  it was / r/whiterights, 
  send a message to / r/europe, 
  agreed, 
  please send us a modmail if you have concerns, 
  you mean the one about if / r/european should be banned , that is so totally not helpfull , is n't really about europe and just creates more drama . 
  please refrain from posting links to removed threads . 
  please refrain from posting topics not connected with europe or there is the posibillity of a ban . 
  no green flair , just private business , and i rarely do something momentum so i fly under the radar . 
  sure we mods can not do much , that is a task only the admins can deal with . 
  dude , you gona have to talk to the admins about this , this definitly is harassment . 
  really interesting article , it is well founded and i agree with it fully, 
  fixed, 
  please from a source i can read  also like i said i know that balkan has many devisions and that there is often one more than one truth so it would be good if you post articles from outside the region . 
  look , please post different sources other than one newspaper , pretend it is a wikipedia article , use more than one source . 
  i am still not sure , just because at the moment it is you saying it is reliable and other saying it is n't so . 
  there are to ways of defining reliabily , reliable until proven otherwise and unreliable until proven otherwise . 
  nobody knows , because they keep journalists away , what nobody knows ... 
  like towing all the ships back to international water / interning them on offshore islands under horrible conditions . 
  they are also kinda island and their way is not really a good way ... 
  no he is being down voted for saying that all imigrants are destroying his culture and that they are evil .
