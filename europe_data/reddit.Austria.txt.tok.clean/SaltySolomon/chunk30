  well , but he is n't elected , so it is kinda a moot point . 
  austria has a term limit on the president , so that map is , well wrong . . 
  also the chancelor does n't get directly elected but is rather the leader of the parlament that can form a mayority in parlament . 
  thb , the eu parlament is much more along the party lines and the epp , what you refere to is far from the mayority they need allies and those are much less likely to help those outrageous overreaches . 
  it is one proposal , to be more specific the one of the comission and it will probably have issues getting passed teh eu parlament , oh well .

   gorbachev well , is n't he either a villian or a hero , depending who you ask , on the one hand he tried and did open the udssr and tried a slow transition , going against the party which makes him a hero in my book , on the other hand he did go against communism which makes him a villian in some books . 
  me reading the post after two months ^ ^ either reddit screwed up or you are doing thread necromancy ,

  sure , but reddit does n't have a nsfl button -  nsfw marking . 
  i am joking , 
  yeah lets officially rename it to austrian !, 
  no no no , you are wrong , we speak austrian which is far superior to german !, 
  i am saying that this smells a lot like pointless grandstanding . 
  sure , but they can be taken to court to it and then nothing will change . 
  pretty much . 
  they do n't have any direct power , but are generally a clearing house for data protection and can sue companies if the agency believes that the data protection laws , not much else . 
  great clickbait title , it is the data protection agency of france , oh well . 
  well uk is now pretty much a non factor as in political influence in brussels so it wo n't change too much . 
  please proof it, 
  well , it is n't just about tarifs , but regulatory barriers and access of services to the single market . 
  you linked to a court case that just interpreted the treaty pretty logical . 
  and free movement is n't total , if you can not find work or find a way to sustain youself financially you can get kicked out and you do n't get any out of work benefits for the first 3 years i think . 
  also , the single market includes services which fta almost never include . 
  i think i mentioned this in my post below ,
