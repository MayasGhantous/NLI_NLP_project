  but this one could influence all the voters , 
  okay , it is pretty interesting , does the goverment try to do anything about it ? 
  i mean a central electoral role would help -  you could n't vote double because it would be bloody obvious ^ ^, 
  sure , it is possible to keep it private , but at the same point it is easy to leak them , especially if they want to , you argued that if it gets leaked then there will have to be a redo , if we are following this argument then pretty much no election could be done . 
  i think the only reall solution is that all the polling stations close at the same time and count at the same time . 
  well , then the law sucks , maybe they should change that one and it is still the parties own fault if their members resign : /, 
  sure , it will be posted anonymous ofc : /, 
  it is if a member of the election commision tweets the local result , should the vote be repreated ? 
  well , but the electoral commision is right , because if they do n't send a member there it is their own fault , also just because there is corelation does n't mean there is causation . 
  the media part is doubtfull , simply because then we would have to redo every election if somebody posts something on social media . 
  well , to be more acurate there would have been the opertuninty for fraud , not the possibility . 
  in the past i would have agreed with you but since the parlament selects the head of the commision and them getting a lot more say in more areas with the last treaty i have to disagree . 
  of the politicans using it as a scape goat , goverments have a huge voice in brussels via the council and no law can be passed without them assenting . 
  well , there are lobby groups in brussels but there are also pro consumer , pro nature and all kinds of pro-something lobby groups .

  what , if i remember correct the eu agriculture industry just exports somewhere else . 
  the issue is more that we could n't figure out how to work togther and distribute the workload , a house divided and so on . 
  this idea is beyond moronic , i am not an expert of your constituion but it usually says that everyone is equal infront of the law and not that everyone is equal . 
  also while i think it is meh to focus on one gender , to be against violence that targets people who are in a weak position is n't that bad of an idea .
