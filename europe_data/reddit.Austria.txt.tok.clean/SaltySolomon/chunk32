  yes, 
  nobody knows, 
  well , i will move to canada , 
  please use the megathread, 
  well , half of them will be unhappy  . 
  you will only need 50 % + 1 vote . 
  i wish i could sticky non mod comments , do you mind me adding it to the post ? 
  usually people with higher degrees do mail in votes and vote more to the left . 
  yeah , it will be very interesting . 
  yeah , we will know tomorrow the soonest after the mail in votes are counted . 
  yes , they are , they do n't include the votes by post . 
  alreay in the post  . 
  you can always hope , 
  including mailed in votes on it will probably take till monday for the final results, 
  so you got a bonner for mr. orban , the diktator of europe ... 
  wait , so you should n't be attacked for the groups you are a member of , but of course i could attack him for all the other things , but those things that come to my mind first . 
  you are right , but mr. hofer should be looked at rather doubiously for his membership in a `` burschenschaft '' that denies the independence of austria and for his made up stories from his trip to israel . 
  you are comparing apple to oranges since the politics in the us are completely different and in my mind is that the democrats are more to the left of the middle , that is for us politics . 
  `` obviously '' i do n't really believe in black and white any more , maybe i am just bitter , but breitbart is one of those sources that i only trust as far as i can throw it . 
  please read up on him . 
  a few recent things : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/austrian-presidential-hopeful-norbert-hofer-allegedly-made-up-israel-terror-incident http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/die-ominoese-israel-reise-des-fpoe-politikers-norbert-hofer-a-1093410.html, 
  if they could i do n't know what they would do they got so many odd members and the mayority of their party leadership consists out of far right `` burschenschaften '' and they are very popular with the neo-nazi scene . 
  this party was founded by neo-nazis and there has n't changed much since , they just have gotten much better at hidding it . 
  they are right , but they got multiple wings and spout whatever they think people want to hear . 
  hofer is from the right wing of the party . 
  yes , but vanderbellen always was on the `` right '' closer to the center part of the party , while hofer is the leader of the right wing of the party , which makes him far right  . 
  it is more like slightly to the left vs. far right permanent liar . 
  sure , not it is just voting for an idiot who permanently lies and will be a shitty president  . 
  oh , he is also a member in an associate that does n't acknowledge the independence of austria ... 
  well , both side do it do n't they ?

  i agree that this was really interesting , and my heart beat faster when the race was ukraine vs. austrailia , but then the race was over imho . 
  well , it was pretty obvious that ukraine had one , simply because russia needed 400 + points which is highly unlikely to get . 
  freeze peaches , go back to voat !,

  good , so you are complaining about the head of another religion not following its tenants while not having a clue about them ? 
  so , wait your argument is that they can not have offsprings , so people who do n't get married or unable to reproduce should n't get married ? 
  that are unbelievable 0,001 percent , i am terrified . 
  adoption , children who lost their biological parents 2 . 
  lesbians and artificial insemination . 
  then you are a very bad christian not even knowing your own faith oh well ... 
  it might be social suicide , but so is it in many other countries and religion to marry outside your own faith . 
  no need to attack on a personal level . 
  we also enslaved them and sent them to different continents all in the name of god ... also racism a bit much much ... 
  that is the most white washing of histroy i have ever seen .

  i think that there are still some structural problems in many ee countries and the eu transfere money will reduce over time when they get richer . 
  it is much easier to grow when you are behind and just straight up expecting same amount of growth will continue is just flat out wrong .
