  you know there is a thing called right to innocent passage ? 
  not really , it really depends on the community and such and their primariy power is of social stigma as with every religion . 
  primarily the size and public perception . 
  there is n't really a hard line about it . 
  for example scientology is seen by germany as a cult or private club while it is a religion in the us . 
  in europe it is usually up to the state which groups to accord the status of a religion . 
  in austria there are various statues an organized belief system can be accorded but to make it short it is usually a numbers game with an element of tradition . 
  no , i believe they said something about the decadent west and own fault or such .

  please attack opinions , not users . 
  that might be , but at the same time , those citizens actively support russian adventures in syria and in ukraine . 
  i mean there is a 100 % chance that putin will be re-elected so why should i have any sympathy with them ? 
  cute , you made the austrian flag !, 
  your proportions are slightly of tho : ^, 
  yeah , it is the same way around , hence my scepticism for this solution , it could only work if there is a fta on everything which ai n't gona happen . 
  the issue with that is what do you define as intermediary goods , if you import tobacco and paper to make cigaretts bowth would be very differently taxed diferently . 
  another can of worms is the wto , if the uk offers those terms to the eu ( they can not offer it to ireland alone because it is part of a trading block ) then it has to offer the same tarrif structure to all countries . 
  i think in the end both civil and common law are much more similar than many think . 
  in both types the courts have to follow the law if it exists and in both they can make it up if it does n't . 
  the only big difference is that courts are n't bound by prwvious decisions although many still follow precedents of higher courts because no judge really likes it if the appeal ends up throwing out your judgement . 
  ankara is more or less the capital for the reason that madrid and not barcelona is the capital . 
  but they do share many of them , because rulings of higher courts are binding and youbusually can always appeal ... 
  imho it reads a lot like a i want stuff , but imho it reads a lot like threathening to use a shotgun on their own foot . 
  sure , but you still have to convince 75 % and pretty much france and germany . 
  in addition the european parlament does have a veto on it too . 
  well , one of the unintented results is that the outcome can and is very different depending on the location were the case resides , this is especially noticeable when there are split decisions on the circuit courts . 
  i think common law is probably fine on local cases , but it scales pretty badly with the size of cases . 
  while i agree that the uk was/is beneficial it is absolutly wrong to say that they were loud on worker protection , for a very long time they fought against worker protection laws like the working time directive . 
  they had an opt-out of it till a wild labour goverment appeared ( i think it was blair ) i agree about the ee expansion which was very much pushed by the uk . 
  which is ironic because now they are railing against what they pushed for ... 
  you do know that eu countries can not conclude their own trade agreements ? 
  i followed your we vs ee rant in the other part of the thread . 
  and you also basically want things for your own benefit mascarading it as wanting it for the general populous . 
  he demanded less money for countries not implementing eu decisions and wanting to reap all the benefits without doing anything for it . 
  also regarding the exporting we can not do anything if you vote for your own shitty corupt politicians . 
  germany & austria matey mate mate, 
  the issue with greece is that if they default they can not take on loans for at least around 10 years and with the current issues that is just not feasable . 
  also the import / export balance would screw over the country even more . 
  well , look at my flair  . 
  agreed , i especially like that der spiegel translates many pieces but which more papers with a decent online precence would do it . 
  austria does n't have any names for eu , 
  well , i think he is primarily refering to the newspapers , which are the worst bunch in europe imho because there is so liitle diversity . 
  the austrian logos happened because every minister wants to brand the ministry and improve his or her name recognizition . 
  also with every new goverment the ministries change slightly ...
