  well , if you feel personal attacked i can only recommend you report the offending comment so that one of the moderators can have a look at it . 
  to add to the questions , if it is something like : what is your favourite food ? 
  we usually let it pass , but there are certain people who ask questions like : sweden is doomed , do you think it is because they are invaded by imigrants . 
  we remove those because they are n't questions , but rather loaded statements . 
  this is a moderated subreddit and there are community rules that enforce basic civility so that everybody can have reasonable arguments , else it would end up in a screaming match where insults fly all time , hence we take our job very seriously and also lock thread when we feel that we can not provide the neccessary resources to ensure civil discussion . 
  well , we usually split the work and use automoderator to do some pre-sorting to help us catch the worst stuff quickly .

  hello / r/all , this thread has blown up , due to not enough mods being online to properly police the thread we were forced to lock the thread . 
  we are currently cleaning it up , waving our ban hammers , so be aware !, 
  on another topic , there is a much better source without a ton of click baiting and much more even reporting , if you are interested , here is the link : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38956212 . 
  else , last every commentor be warned , we wo n't be mercifull in this thread and only hand out bans , no warnings because this comment should be warning enough . 
  have a nice day , the / r/europe mod team . 
  please do n't attack other users personally .

  we are n't banning the completetly , we are just speeding up the departure of one type after a couple of days ( usually a week ) and we all know that the next x of europe will show up very quickly anyways . 
  we are also not removing currenty x of europe posts , but only the new ones so that the topic slowly fades out . 
  to expand on my co-mods anser : 1 . 
  there is way more to do on big subs with even a loose connection to politics / ideologies , because while it is rather hard to get into a fisticuffs about a painting , you just have to scream trump and one will break out . 
  agenda pushing happens very rarely , we primarily use it for sock puppet accounts where people create accounts to argue with themselfes o.o. 
  the racism and bigotry thingy happens more frequently but it usually depends on the topic that is the main interest at the time . 
  the most regular of the three is personal attacks which happens a lot . 
  we try our best , somewhere else was already mentioned that we try to keep the subreddit as diverse as possible and to allow as free a conversation while keeping the nutters out . 
  this is only applicipable to news papers , and there even only broadly . 
  sir , this is a warning , do n't editorialize headlines , repost old news and/or post videos without any context , repeat offences will result in a ban . 
  have a lovely day , saltysolomon,

  we try to find a balance between original sources and editorialisation , but it is pretty difficult . 
  currently you do n't need a translation and usually it is enough if you put a google translate link in the comments . 
  yeah , interesting times in romania atm ^ ^,
