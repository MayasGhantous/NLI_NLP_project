  i do n't know , how many bitcoins do you have  oh , sorry i forgot we are getting payed by the eu now  . 
  we are sadly not online 24/7 and sometimes things slip trugh , thats why those threads showed up . 
  sorry , but the general rule is that it has to be primarily about europe and that it is n't enough that a european person is mentionend . 
  by your logic every article about christoph walz would needed to be allowed because he is from austria . 
  we remove articles where the topic is n't primarily europe , but rather some us person hopes that the us president helps him do something .
