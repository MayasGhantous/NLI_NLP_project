  i am sure the voters will be happy if everything has to be cut because the goverment received less taxes . 
  also why would the companies move to the uk when they do n't get access to the single market ? 
  i am sure we can fake a vote , 
  i think / r/yurop will love the post !, 
  well , all things must come to an end , pitty i liked ireland when i visited it , oh well , soon it will be no more !,

   these rules are not exhaustive ; moderators reserve the right to take necessary corrective action where deemed appropriate we have n't gotten around to update the rules : /, 
  yes , it does violate the no questions please rule , please use / r/askeurope  . 
  we remove translate.google.com from the submissions because it kinda nukes all our other automod rules and we want to drive traffic to the actual site , however we heavily encourage submission of a link to the translation in the comments .
