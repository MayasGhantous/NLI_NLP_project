  yes , you can , in austria especially tabloids are forced to post obmissions of being false at the same place of the original article , if it was page 1 one will have to be printed on page one and so on . 
  what a wall of text , making very little sense ...

  well , i am a `` poor '' student , so i am sticking with android  . 
  well , there was a long time when there was no official reddit app , especially on android . 
  i am for one using the baconreader which is a really great reader , you should try it out ^ ^ . 
  yeah , that is one recommendation , but there are many more reddit apps . 
  okay , slight communication error on our back-end , fixed it now . 
  usually because of a high influx of users who do n't know the subreddits rules and/or are on mobile where it is harder to look them up . 
  goode evening , morning or whatever time it is !, 
  here are the mods speaking . 
  it is really interesting how much discussion this post generated and i think it has reached / r/all !, 
  because of this i would like to remind everybody that there are subreddit rules ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/wiki/community_rules ) and that we will ban people for breaking them with a special consideration for those breaking the rules regarding hate speech ( racism , sexism and so on ) and personal attacks ( please do n't call eachother dimwit and so on ) . 
  greetings the mods . 
  please keep civil !, 
  yes , because it would have been removed for the same reason , completly lacking context and we rather have the context of a story than a 140 letter headline . 
  hi , here are the mods , we checked the credentials the op . 
  it would be great if you could help him finish his research study !, 
  no , it was removed because yours was a random screencap of a random document without any context . 
  yes , much better , thank you and have a nice day !, 
  i know emotions are high , but thats not a reason to insult users of / r/europe !,

  i mean we did n't want him , so why not , 
  throws our next wannabe dicator after you , 
  okay , so killing germans is moral , but killing others is n't . 
  you are digging your downvote hole on your own , no need to help you there . 
  and pointing out that both side did some very nasty stuff is now revisionist ... 
  personal attacks , seems you got the real issues with people disagreeing with you ... 
  nope , his proposal was much better because austria would have gotten a part , 
  germans ! = germany , also why exactly is it morally right to do the same to your enemy ? 
  by your logic uk is n't a victim of german agression because they did those bombings ... 
  i am not disbuting railhub and industry bombing were justified , but that by `` accident '' the entire city got carpetbombed is kinda meh .

  two wrongs do n't make one right ... 
  allright , you are of the kill everybody , ask questions never type , alright . 
  yeah , speak about victim blaming , if they had surrendered we would n't have been forced to firebomb civilian cities filled with refugees to the ground ... 
  this is a bit like saying no , the germans were perfectly alright at bombing londons civilian population , because great britain did n't surrender .

  well , my issue is that many define a pro-turkish stance as a blank check to whitewash history in ones country favor . 
  i think both sides did horrible things and there is no good reason why somebody should be killed . 
  well , the you are the lucky exception i mean everybody screws up , but you got to own up to it and i am strongly against making people resonsible for something an ancestory did .
