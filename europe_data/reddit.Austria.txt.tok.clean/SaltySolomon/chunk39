  well , sadly the most `` patriotic '' ( i would n't call them that ) turks always show up and basically say how great they are and how turkey did nothing ever wrong . 
  i think they fail to understand that europe and europeans are willing to forgive , but the first step is to admit that you did something wrong . 
  thank you for the voice of reason , if you see that bs , report it asap , i just nuked the entire comment chain of that comment and handed out a few bans , because holly shit that got idiotic !, 
  sure , but dresden was bombed to the ground 25.000 people wiped out in a single night !, 
  this sets a precedent and especially because it was a multi-country judgement there is a very high expectancy that the court will rule the same way on future challenges and the data retention part of the ips ( investigory powers act / snoopers charter ) is very similar to the law that was struc down . 
  i am sure the british had many `` valuable military '' targets in the middle of a city to use that kind of bomb ... 
  i know the germans where gruessome ( and stupid ) with bombing london and cities like it but the allies were n't much better when it came the other way and they bombed cities with burning bombs that destroyed some cities almost completly .

  look , this is probably not the right subreddit , but a womans shellter is probably still the best place , if he comes after you there they will call the police on him and he will be dealt with .

  i do n't think that 12,5 % are unfair it is the usual tax rate . 
  and why should be apple be allowed to pay ( lower ) taxes in the us for income generated i the eu ? 
  sure , but the point is the ammount they pay for revenue earned inside the eu , thats what the issue is all about . 
  yeah i would pay 12.5 % , but apple managed to move profits to a office that does n't exist anywhere and basically paid 0.005 % on profits in the eu . 
  i agree that 0.005 effective tax is abusurdly good thats why i also want it , how do i get it ? 
  because apple benefitted from it and they basically have to pay back the ammount that distortet the market . 
  the arguments of ireland are basically that they are n't even denying what they did , but that it was correct o.o so , i can create a company and only pay 0.005 taxes ayy yamo . 
  yeah , i know i also really dislike having to remove it , sadly enough it is against the subreddit rules .

  they probably always will find a way , however there is no need to create a focus point for the to rally to . 
  well , in the past austria rented it for a home for handicapped people but when they wanted to add a barrierfree entrance the owner balked and since then the house is empty which is n't ideal for obvious reasons . 
  they did try and buy it normally but the owner did n't want to sell hence this . 
  did you even read the article , basically the austrian republic will reimburse market value to the owner of the house .
