  this is boilerplate , editorialization is also injecting one 's own opinion into the headline and this happened in this case .

  i just reapproved it , next time just say the site changed the title so that we can be quicker about it . 
  so you are saying the site changed the title after posting ? 
  we the mods can not change the title and blame the op , the title is so editorialized it is n't even funny . 
  if the op had read the subreddits rules he would have known that it will be removed .
