  hello community of / r/europe , as you might have noticed the articles about this stories were removed in the last few hours , this was primarily due to a debate about the interpretation of the local crime rule that is there to prevent the subreddit being flooded by everyday crime . 
  after some debate we decided that the story outgrew the category , however this will be the only approved thread and all others will be removed as a dublicate . 
  greetings the / r/europe mod team,

  that makes them questionable , i am personally all for moonshots and things that improve the people 's lives but you also should figure out where to get the money from . 
  you brits are n't blessed with good parties , i think the first pass the post system hurts so much because it basically leads to two parties dominating . 
  i his i would vote lib dems as the only real pro-eu party even if i they do n't have a snowballs chance in hell of doing anything : /, 
  jeremy corbin is a wanker , if you pardon my french , he does have some decent ideas , but the majority of his ideas are highly questionable .
