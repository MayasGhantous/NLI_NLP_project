  but what is people or savy business man stopping them from importing it . 
  it very much feels like people complaing about something they could very much change by voting with their purses , ie . 
  stop buying it . 
  i also do n't really see the legal case of it they are different products from the same company . 
  because what they are basically doing is selling different products in different countries . 
  yes , it is from the same factory but so are many off-brand products in supermarkets . 
  breaking news , yes it is the same grand , but not the same product . 
  also do they both cost the same ?

  our puprose is n't the keeping of peace and i personally see it as an extension of the hate speech rule . 
  but lets sidestep the nation issue , do you think a german user of this site would argue that because he is n't allowed to say that the holocaust should n't be called genocide that he is n't allowed to defend himself . 
  also we also really do n't appreciate as a mods if sometbody is saying that all turks are evil because there fathers fathers did something evil and will remove comments and ban repeat offenders , but what we will not remove are comments saying that it is bad that turks are n't owning up to their past or similiar, 
  because we really like the easy way where you do n't need a bot . 
  less acceptance and a volatile exchange rate .

  would you , as an american say that somebody who is an american second or first generation is not a true american ? 
  so , how can anybody then apply for asylum ? 
  so , basically , it is impossible to be ever a frenchman unless you are white and your family lived in france for the last 300 years . 
  i am really sure that makes integration much easier / s. 
  so , sending people to detention centers under horrid conditions and breaking international law of the sea ?
