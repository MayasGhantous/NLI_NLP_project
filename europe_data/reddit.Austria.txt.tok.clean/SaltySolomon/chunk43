  i just think they are built with the goal of replacing a king with a pralament that should be worshiped . 
  i very much like modern type parlaments because they usually are more worklike as it should be . 
  also those old buildings did n't think about the need for commitees , offices and all that stuff that is really needed in a more complex world !, 
  well , i meant westminster , but ours is also falling apart , so they renovate it over the next 3 years !, 
  you mean that thing that is falling to pieces and has a main chamber that is to small for all its members ? 
  i really like the new design , yes it is not the prettiest but it feels very much like a place where work gets done . 
  btw one of my favourite parlament is the scottish, 
  yes !,

  moved to https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/6jn2i3/what_are_the_stupidest_questions_you_heard_from, 
  i see it going the other way , certain people and media outlets call for removal of all foreigners and call them all economic immigrants to push their agenda . 
  i also agree that economic immigrants should be sent back if they do n't add anything and can be sent back . 
  we can not do much if a country simply denies taking them back . 
  you are accusing the mainstream of not being like you and saying that they should be more like you or that your voice is n't heard , well maybe it is n't worth hearing if you want to send syrian people back to a war zone because they are `` economic immigrants '' . 
  great change of topic , so they are allowed to lie if you agree with it , okay ...

  and every right wing media makes out of every refugee an economic migrant , i mean who sits in a glass house should n't throw around bad news papers . 
  no , we just randomly choose two countries to change colour , what is this humour you are talking about !, 
  we are n't only checking for reliability , also things like editorialization and the other rules . 
  how much would you pay for it , we take karma as payment !, 
  in the past we had an automod that silently removed things with certain keywords , nowerdays it simply tells a mod to give a human okay .

  i think you are confusing things the strong power is from the constitution which improved on the hilariously broken articles of confederation .

  it was a council resolution , which is binding and there was n't a eu parlament vote because it does n't have jurisdiction on immigration matters . 
  since the magna carter only applies to barons it would be interesting how it is interpreted nowadays . 
  also parlament is pretty much free to change that on a whim with an act . 
  the human rights act is the implementation of the charter , hence an exit would be by repealing hence act . 
  regarding slavery , i am not an expert so you will have to ask somebody else . 
  a law that was voted on by the majority has still to be followed by the minority , that how it works ... 
  okay , so rule of law is n't necessary when it suits you , let 's say you kill somebody very unpopular then you should n't be punished because then law is only an opinion ? 
  which everybody agreed to and ratified hence it has the power of a law . 
  the eu money itself would probaly not have the effect , but the cocktail of crony capitalism with corruption would surely do it . 
  ah , yes france , uk , norway , finland and sweden really did try to remove you . 
  so , in you opinion , would it be better to be dirt poor or being actually owned by russia rather than getting money for infrastructure projects and help with figthing corruption . 
  by best guestimate is that the commision is going after countries that are activly pushing back against it first , hence the suits . 
  because you can not say with a straight face that those countries even tried to pretend to work on it . 
  i mean sure you could do that , but it would smash your economy and you would be back to communist level and have your nice little corupt goverments run everything .
