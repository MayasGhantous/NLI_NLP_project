  i what do you think happens if somebody believes a sector would n't be profitable , they will sell it and if nobody wants to buy it because everybody agrees the company will fold , what do you think will happen if a country suddenly has only one bank ? 
  with no competion they can charge whatever they want to their customers and they will simply pass along the sector taxes ... also it would end pretty much all foreign direct investment in said country because who in their right mind would invest in a country where the next week the goverment decides to remove your buisness because it is foreign . 
  i certainly disagree that austria has n't been charged yet , i would even push the commision to do it , but maybe there is currently some neogtiation going on or they are working on it whatever , just pointing out that we do n't have all the facts . 
  you personally did n't say it but the general drift of the comments is pretty much that rather than pushing for everybody breaking the law getting punished an exception is made for certain countries because , heck i do n't even know ... 
  remind me who pays for all the stuff in ee . 
  also we are n't talking about redistributing economic immigrants but rather refugees from things like war zones . 
  or should have austria rejected refugees from ee and sent them back to the `` loving hands of the udssr ? 
  so , that is a very eastern attidute , rules should be enforced first on everybody else , but not on me , i am special why me the others are doing it too ... 
  the commision thinks they broke it , now it is up to the ecj to decide if they did or not , what is so hard to wrap ones head about it , it is litteraly the job of the commision to do this . 
  with all the shit the ee pulls i really think the money we send over should be stopped or reduced because all you ever want is to have a cake and eat it . 
  okay , now you are just strawmanning , how does compare getting taken to court over breaking an agreement to forced suicide ? 
  i can only restate what others said , they do n't have been idiots about the matter and did n't activly resist prodding by the commision , also that is like a ten year old level exucse , i should n't be punished becauese the other one has n't been ( yet ) . 
  so , we should n't follow laws anymore ? 
  what would theresa may need to do to get a mayority in the next ( snap ) election ?

  as by our decision things that happen in the asian part of turkey are only on-topic for the subreddit if it is a national topic . 
  i garter that you did have geography in school , if so i would have you have a look at a map . 
  also , besides it being local crime it is also off topic .

  it will be certainly interesting what their take on this clusterf *** ( mod censorship ) of an election is . 
  you probably confused moderators , who are volunteers and do all the hard work and admins , who are paid reddit employees who run the site ( and are obviously lazy  ),

  if you mean by not supporting them directly bombing then , then yes you are correct . 
  well , i am sure that you will do fine and if worse comes to worst i am sure you will either make it better or find a place in another country . 
  i have heated that austria is quite nice to live in , 
  but now that they got the military , police and justiciary basically fully under controll : /, 
  well , most nato states are supporting the kurds against isis while turkey is/was happily supporting isis and bombing the kurds . 
  i fear that if they slowly loose their grip that they will just get worse . 
  oh , the relationship between austria and turkey sucks really hard ( at least between the goverments ) . 
  i mean regarding the referendum , at least it did n't `` produce '' something absurd like 99.9 % aprroval ^ ^, 
  but turkeys population votes for erdogans proposals and votes for his party , or that even worse party . 
  that makes it kinda difficult to see , i agree that it is more , but the majority is kinda that : /, 
  i just do n't see any shared values with turkey anymore , they got a nice dic , sorry i mean president , they jail independent journalists and sue everybody who is against the almighty and corrupt akp and erdogan to the ground in courts that are , lets just say , less than independent . 
  i know , but still breaks the rules , what we however would allow would be a recent article referencing that article .
