  i think he was being sarcastic . 
  i do n't think is wrong , but it is wrong not to point out ulterior motives . 
  they argue that this could happen , you are currently strawmanning hard ... also it is n't as the other eu-countries did n't had helicopter safety laws . 
  well , if they were in the eu , they would have a voice , but because they are n't , they will have to deal with it now ... 
  less competion = higher wages ... 
  i mean , they can decide to not follow through with it and life with the consequences , but i think the real reason is that they wo n't allow bids by third party countries is so that they face less competion and not any security concerns . 
  they , wo n't try , they will do . 
  yes , and the commission will take them to the efta court , win and norway will either accept it or will pay punishment tariffs or so till they change their rules .

  well , i would n't say that your argument is a bad one , a common currency also helps a lot with promoting tourism . 
  but what you are doing on a small scale has to be done by buisness and on a big scale and they always have to change their calculations based on the changing exchange rate , which ads complexity and costs .

  thank you . 
  no , because then the list would be useless . 
  that was one of the reasons , second is personal attacks , which you are n't even denying , you can not expect to break the rules and to keep the comment up ... 
  https://www.reddit.com//r/europe/wiki/community_rules these rules are not exhaustive ; moderators reserve the right to take necessary corrective action where deemed appropriate is taken directly from there . 
  of course there is : `` these rules are not exhaustive ; moderators reserve the right to take necessary corrective action where deemed appropriate . '', 
  ( this rule is implied on every subreddit , by the way ) and personal attacks is covered under : `` attacks on other users : stick to the topic at hand and remain civil towards other users . '', 
  just because we are moderators does n't mean we are n't users of the subreddit . 
  / u/greekball would get a heartattack if you would call him proeu to his face ! .

  trying to circumvent auto moderator and personal attack on the mods , 
  well , we are actually only sending it to mod q to have a second look , it might take some time but we actually approve like 90 % of those comments . 
  it is a precaution , because certain topics are prone to breaking the subs rules and hence we prefere to get a head start and not to mop up when a comment was already on the site for 10 hours .
