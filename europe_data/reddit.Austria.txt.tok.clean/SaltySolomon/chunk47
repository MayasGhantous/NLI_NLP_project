  sure , it is hating a country , or at least the politics / politian of a country ( which in the case was elected , sooo . 
  but hating somebody is n't against the subs rules . 
  i do n't know 100 % how the other mods are handeling it , i personally am usually removing it unless it is making a point . 
  we do remove the traitor thingys when we see then , but how is hoping the country breaks apart and the economy collapses racism or xenophobia ?

  no doubt it is a prop , but junker is a seasoned politician and negotiator so i imagined he expected something like that it will be fast and/or simple to convlude an exit agreement . 
  and in cinema there is the advice to show , not tell . 
  it simply has a bigger impact if junker shows may the last two treaties rather than tell her that they have many pages . 
  i think he choose the croatia accession treaty because it is the most recent accession treaty .
