  i think it will be similar to what it is at the moment , but the votes will be different and we will have to mod less . 
  at the moment we have to mod quite a bit and you do n't really see the worst : /, 
  yes , in the future people will have their frontpage made from the popular subs till they subscribe to enough subs on their own . 
  but they wo n't get automatically subscribed to europe . 
  let me talk it over with my co-mods and i will get back to you asap !, 
  if a new user with a european ip signs up for reddit he automatically gets subscribed to / r/europe with a few exceptions like the uk or russia . 
  because of this the community never gets a chance to stabalize and explodeds in subscriber numbers . 
  i also agree that it is very sad and the primary problem is the size of the audience , maybe it will get better when there are n't any defaults anymore . 
  but sharia law is pretty much a ( social ) contract and a `` crime '' is a breach of contract . 
  sure they do , look at www.atlanticcouncil.org / they even got a blog section !, 
  could you post the direct link to it , the issue is primarily that it is on medium , which only syndicates blogs .

  well , we kinda remove almost all self posts that are a discussion starter , simply because too many abuse it for soapboxing : /, 
  you do know that every dispute about a contract that ends in arbitration is paralel justice and it is perfectly legal if all sides agree to it . 
  ( unless it breaks a law of course ) . 
  well , the eu has also thought of that and is limiting what they are allowed to charge each other for roaming and are reducing it over time too . 
  well , that is part of the proposal , it basically says that if ni wants it can , not must .

  yes , but he is more of an amateur , he only had one familiy in his cellar , you have to think big man !, 
  it always looks weird if the most upvoted answers go unanswered , 
  sure , but i am also sure the community will ask many uncomfortable questions too , 
  haha , we got a tool for it called mod toolbox , but sometimes it is harder and or easier to push that button . 
  sorry , i confused you with a reasonable person and forgot that i am on the gun toting american stereotype . 
  sorry , but i have issues if a pro-gun lobby designs laws with a `` happy '' medium : / . 
  sorry , i do n't really see your point , is he allowed to strawmen because others are doing it ?

  yes , and a rabid gun organisation will help a lot ... 
  but everytime somebody propsosed to do the mildest against those things , like actually enforce the current law or force save storage the nra is there to stop it ... 
  but do n't have those guns to be smuggled in ? 
  you mean thats why the nra defends school shootings , kids killing themselfes with the guns of their parents acidentally , selling guns to mentally unstable people and trying to discourage people to learn how to be resonsible with guns . .

  we clearly communicated that if he breaks the subs rules we will pull the plug on the ama . 
  i tend to agree with you but , comparing firearms with baseballs is a straw man argument .

  we actually never blanket banned them , we just filtered all their mentions of the subreddit name ( no need to feed the troll ) and permmabanned people if they broke the subs rules on / r/europe because if a person breaks a rule on this sub we usually look how probable it is that they will do it again , and with participants of that sub ...
