  i think we all know that austria is the best country . 
  ( or else you will get banned !, 
   ) also confusing austria with australia is punnishable by bannishment !, 
  if brigading and such happens we will pull the plug on it . 
  sorry , i mean to say that punishments are a subset of consequences ... 
  punishment and consequence are the same ... 
  of course there is free speech , but you will have to live with the consequenes . 
  freedom of speech usually only applies to the goverment .

  what ? 
  if i remember correctly the biggest hang up of the uk was intra-eu imigration which has exactly 0 to do with germanys imigration policy and rather with british isolationism and exceptionalism . 
  i doubt it , i also do n't think that they could have granted citizenship to a significant amount of people in the last two years .

  no , news articles older than 3 months are n't allowed , we are generally less harsh on articles like these , although we will have to rethink the policy on those too .

  as you probably know , turkey is electing a new parlament which will rule turkey for the next four years . 
  ### current results : 99 % counted ## http://www.yenisafak.com.tr/secim-2015/secim-sonuclari party 1 ( orange ) = akp 40,8 % / 258 seats party 2 ( red ) = chp 25,1 % / 132 party 3 ( blue ) = mhp 16,4 % / 81 party 4 ( green ) = hdp 13 % / 79 thanks / u/finish-him this is a place where to collect articles about the election and discuss them . 
  the important parties are : * akp : adalet ve kalkinma partisi ( justice and development party ) * chp : cumhuriyet halk partisi ( republican people 's party ) * mhp : milliyetci hareket partisi ( nationalist movement party ) * hdp : halklaring demokratik partisi ( peoples ' democratic party ) #good description of the parties : by user / u/folieadeux6 this will be very , very superficial so do your best to follow . 
  akp : akp is akp . 
  islamists , but islam is really a tool they use to maintain a pseudo-authoritarian state with their voters genuinely believing in the most absurd conspiracy theories about how the entire western world is out to destroy the `` thriving , conservative turkish ideal '' . 
  chp : their new leader kilicdaroglu has really changed his party 's former ideology , which was borderline elitism that catered to about 20 percent of the population . 
  they are always `` good '' compared to others simply because of their more european values , but with kilicdaroglu they finally learned how to embrace the other 80 % of the nation as well . 
  think social democrats in france , really , but it 's a completely different country so their goals are a bit different . 
  mhp : turkish nationalists who might actually be the worst . 
  they usually come with the whole package , that is fanatic nationalism and fanatic islamism ; because if they were remotely rational in their nationalist beliefs they would vote for chp . 
  their leader is an extremely passive man who is secretly hinting towards a coalition with akp -- no idea why any rational person would vote for them . 
  hdp : their presence here is huge . 
  they come from a kurdish nationalist background , but they were initially formed separately from the former kurdish nationalists . 
  they are the only truly leftist party remotely close to being present in the parliament , they emphasize equality and tolerance . 
  while they will get their fixed 8-9 % from the kurdish people in the south east region , whether or not they make it past the 10 % barrier depends on the rest of the nation . 
  their leader is honestly the most charismatic/convincing man i 've seen in turkish politics , a former human rights lawyer and an activist . 
  i 'm voting for them , even though chp is slightly closer to my ideological views especially with their new leader , but with the absurdity of the 10 % barrier present you are obliged to vote strategically . 
  if hdp does n't make it above 10 % , akp is easily getting enough votes to form a government without a coalition . 
  if hdp does make it , and there 's a very decent chance that they do make it ( which is why we are all so excited ) , for the first time in 15 years we might have a non-akp government in the form of a chp-mhp or chp-hdp coalition . 
  in my opinion the former will screw things up since they cater exclusively to the 30 % , but the latter might be so revolutionary for turkish democracy . 
  plus , it 's proof that a majority muslim democracy can elect a secular government , which does n't happen a lot obviously . 
  why is this even possible ? 
  erdogan tried a pseudo-putin/medvedev switch , but the new leader of his party is a borderline retarded man . 
  he 's trying to save face by endorsing his own party ( which is directly illegal for the country 's president ) but nobody gives a shit . 
  again , these elections are huge . 
  [  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38w5yu/megathread_turkish_general_election/crycbmn ) #the negative sides of the parties , according to / u/alceus akp : hijacking religion and trying too fool people with their pro-republic stance . 
  also corrupt as fuck . 
  chp : corrupt and inept in governing . 
  party leader is not better than erdogan . 
  blames erdogan for his own mistakes . 
  mhp : lost touch with the people . 
  became anti-government die-hard opposition . 
  tries too hard to become relevant . 
  hdp : works with the terrorist group pkk . 
  more reasons but to lazy to write em #tl ; dr : about tr elections . 
  by / u/kellykey : ** party election goals are : ** * akp : wants one party government and wants to leave hdp below treshold ( 10 % vote required to be in parliament ) . 
  * if they can atleast have ~ 42 % of the votes and hdp cant pass the treshold akp more likely to success their own goals . 
  this may give them enough seats to give permission to have referendum for presidential system . 
  ( i think they need 330 seats for this and 276 for one party government , if hdp cant pass the treshold then akp is about to have atleast 45 to 55 seats for free . ), 
  * chp : chances are n't really high they want to be one party government if ca n't , they are probably up for a coalition government . 
  they want to change everything to be a new european country . 
  ( i believe turkey can be into eu with this government ! ), 
  * mhp : idk , its pretty lame they are looking out for more votes after their big fail and they seem to be successful at it . 
  akp and hdp is extremely far to this party , its like they are all enemies . 
  * hdp : wants to be representation for kurds and pkk ( kinda ) . 
  their main goal to pass the treshold and not bring akp to power . 
  ** result are could be in 3 scenarios : ** * akp gets +40 % of the votes , hdp cant pass the treshold , akp is more likely to referendum for presidential system . 
  * akp gets +38 % to +40 % of the votes , hdp can pass the treshold , akp is can appear to be have one party government still if they can get enough seats . 
  ( 276 ) * coalition governments . 
  akp gets lower than expected , hdp passes the treshold . 
  then this can bring chp + mhp to the power or even chp + mhp + hdp . 
  ** final thoughts .
