  you can voice your opinion but plese stay civil . 
  i know this is an hot button issue , but please try to avoid insults , generalisations and inflamatory comments . 
  there are a couple reports for being a right wing circlejerk . 
  in my opinion it is n't against the rules but be advised that the mods will monitor this thread . 
  could you please back up your argument with some kind of study from a reliable source ? 
  could you add a translation of the article in the comments ? 
  i applie the rule not really stictly , unless the op changes a ton and adds his oppinion rather obliviously i still approve the post . 
  that thing is awesome , just have a look at it . 
   brought to you by a guy who is famous for cherry-picking russian statistical data to paint a rosy picture of russian demographics and economy . 
  after reading a few of his post i agree with you , but still no reason to downvote the post , yes this person is cherrypicking things , but would n't that end up in hillarious comments proving him wrong if more people see his rather dumb statistik , 
  on the one hand , i ** do ** post sometimes and i will be more active on the sub . 
  i really love this subreddit , the community and the people here . 
  i will do my best to make sure that every opinion is heared ( unless you end up insulting people ) and that this community stays friendly . 
  well i wanted to become a mod of / r/europe because i love the subreddit but i felt that it was moderated a bit in a wrong way . 
  too much banning and drama . 
  i felt that if i joined it i might be able to change things and make it a better community . 
  it is not that i never post it is just that i post about once a month an article or comment here and there, 
  well , most of them are really small one which have almost no submissions . 
  also this is a network , and i am a `` senior mod '' there which basiclly means that i have more of a role to make sure everything is running smoothly and fine . 
  for more info you can go to our public moderation subreddit / r/imaginarynetwork where you can read our rules in more detail and have a look on our dessicion making . 
  my favourite color is red . 
  hi , i am one of the new moderators now , i was a longtime lurker only with post here and there , so if you have any questions , ask away !, 
  that 's our only mission , 
  let me ask you , why should n't the piano be on fire ? 
  i mean i am all for limiting `` social benefit tourism '' however i believe that the concerns are overblown . 
  it will be interesting how he what exactly he will propose , if he does n't offer something concrete it will be just an endless dance similar to what is happening with greece . 
  could you post a translation , even if it is only google translate, 
  http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/full-width/images/2015/05/articles/main/20150523_wwd000.jpg also , paywall :(, 
  if you are part of the eea or efta , you already have to pay membership dues and follow most of the laws . 
  hi , i am saltysolomon and i am applying for the position as a moderator on / r/europe . 
  i have a lot of moderation experience of at the imaginarynetwork ( basicly the nsfwporn network for art ) . 
  i have some css experience , never done any css for a subreddit tho . 
  now let me answer your questions . 
  * do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  like i already said , no automod experience , i can do css and due to my moderation expirience a good amount of experience with toolbox ( as a user ) . 
  * what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  i am gmt +1 , but i am almost always up till 1 o'clock in the night and got baconreader on my phone , so messages and such always reach me . 
  * what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe my favourite part is the cool discussions , interesting articles and that it keeps me up to date on what is happening in europe . 
  on the other hand my least favourite part about / r/europe are obvious russian shills , low quality post , the ( rare ) raceist or sexist post and links to articles which have no factual basis . 
  * what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  maybe a new css and most definitly stricter moderation of discussions/posts . 
  * what would make you a good moderator ? 
  i am a lot of time on / r/europe , like to help users/have a thick skin and have a lot of moderation experience . 
  i think the person wanted to show how `` overpaid '' the eu `` bureaucrats '' are . 
  so it does n't fit into his narative that austria pay ridiculous amounts of money to our politians . 
  then specify those proven without doubt . 
  rename the rule to genocide denial and everybody will be happy . 
  and make a sub-rule that makes examples . 
  i think that the aviation industry is learning from every desaster a bit more on how to secure it more . 
  imho the only positive thing to come out of 9/11 is the introduction of the secure doors , although that backfired in this case , so i gues the new procedure will help and it wo n't cost more money , 
  that is actually a good idea , most of the time the residents there are incredibly lonly . 
  yes , europe will sink into the ocean , never to reappear !, 
  you could try to transfer those liabilities to pounds , if it is a mortage on a house , you could have a look at taking a credit in euros , kredits are really cheap atm .

  appartently you have no clue how taxes work , pensionsystem is part of your worktaxes . 
  while you are partially right , i do n't think that they triggered the cuts or increased them noticeable . 
  please cite sources at the moment you are only talking hot air . 
  also i do n't how the pension system in finland works , but in austria you want more young people to work because else there are n't any people who pay the old peoples rent ... 
  i do n't think that those cuts where due to the influx of refugees , but rather due to the general bad economic outlook . 
  they were pretty spammy at one point and with community growth we kinda had to ban them : / . 
  nope , you either got a joke answer or made this just up , we have no clue and the person who introduced them is n't working at reddit anymore . 
  i mean it could always be deducted from the generous grant money for the eastern countries . 
  i think it is a combination of population and economic factors and of course the numbers of refugees that you are giving refuge count towards your quota . 
  the biggest problem is that there are people who have no tolerance for differences are acusing people who are tollerant of people following the laws and are different that they are suddenly traitors and have `` too much '' tolerance .

  i do n't disagree that there are differences but i do disagree about the size . 
  to my knowledge there are n't many good ( or any ? ), 
  scientific studies on that topic because it is really touchy . 
  i think you are trolling , but whatever , for example in sweden every case of forced sexual intercourse is counted as a rape , while in many others they all count under on record . 
  social , i.e. 
  if the priest of the local parish rapes somebody it can be social suicide to report it . 
  i know , while i am not studying law , we got an intro into it at my uni to know what we are allowed to do and what not and how to look stuff up  . 
  from which law are you quoting now  . 
  i asuming that it is the austrian . 
  but i do n't know what we are discoussing now  . 
  i just wanted to add above that todschlag would be :  \u00a7 76 . 
  in law as it is used you have to prove intent . 
  well , it would only be murder if it is planned , if it `` happens '' it would be `` todschlag '' . 
  the punishment maximum in germany is the highest possible and punishments are n't addative though . 
  although the punishment will be higher when there were more crimes commited .

  he wrote the parts from the german law code underneath , basically it is 5 to 15 years if the victim has longer lasting damages . 
  those numbers are 100 % not compbatible and you are underestimating the legal definions of rape a lot and the social athmosphere about reporting rape . 
  til date rape and martial rape is n't rape ...
