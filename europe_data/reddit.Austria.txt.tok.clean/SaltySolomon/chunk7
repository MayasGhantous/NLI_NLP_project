  it was a compromise and generally the number 12 is for unity and wholeness . 
  yep the official one is the darker blue , the light blue is an abomination . 
  i do n't know what everybody has about the industrial base , it is n't that great to have the country full with toxic industries that destroy the ecosystem .

  surveys have to be cleared first with the mod team . 
  i love it when people are proposing to outlaw cryptogryphy , because terrorists , will really care if its illegal  . 
  yeah , i am really sure that every `` proper '' englishman would never ever commit any crimes / s. 
  nope it would n't simply because the money spend on housing would be better serverd in other ways . 
  also services are reral products , ie . 
  transportation of goods is a product that is needed .

  i think you should be imprisioned indefinitly without a fair trial , those parts are als opart of the ecohr which every eu country signed on and the echr is the one that judges about them , so i do n't see your point . 
  well , what is the alternative at the moment ? 
  the eu , i do n't think this is politically possible . 
  we still need nato , and the eu must finally work together on imigration . 
  i also think that the swedish goverment employs airplanes to disperse chemicals to make the population weak , those damm chemtrails !,

  i also would like to add that he is rather right wing and pretty neo-nazi . 
  okay , let me refrase it , i blame the v4 , including mr. orban . 
  cooperation between turkey and kurds will never happen , they kinda have oposite goals . 
  also , you pretend like you will send them there and that it will be clean . 
  it is very hard to defend soft targets in a warzone with modern weapons . 
  about those save zones in syria , how do you propose to create them ? 
  i mean we would still to make some deal with turkey just to create them , also would you be ready to send troups of your country there to die to defend those save spots ? 
  tough luck , they want refuge , thats the way they will have to do it . 
  well , then stop complaining about the turkey deal , also i am pretty sure that there will be some way of buying yourself out of the obligation , like paying for the refugee in another country . 
  so you want to put all the financial pressure on a country that is pretty close to finanical colapse , how nice of you , also impractical . 
  turkey is a usefull tool , which we need because we could n't figure out how to distribute the refugees inside the eu , thanks to you mr. orban .

  numbers do n't but people do , you should delete your account . 
  same reason , as this , one lacking context . 
  great , we are trying to have high quallity discousion with the basis grounded in good quality journalism . 
  sadly not many read past the headline on reddit : / . 
  the topic would be more than welcome if it would be posted via a reputable newspaper .
