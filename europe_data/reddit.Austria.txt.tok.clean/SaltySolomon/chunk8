  thats what you are saying , but this will turn into a great anti-refugee circlejerk because it is `` 840 % '' which ofc sounds way better .

  statistics without context are great to mislead , for example , the murder rate in new york increases during summer and also more ice cream is sold , does this mean that ice cream is causing people to kill others ?

  the problem is with those laws that if it is too easy to lock somebody up indefinitly , then it can be abused a lot . 
  we define it as , spamming the subreddit with exactly one topic . 
  some random politican said something stupid about an american event . 
  missclicked , i meant to mark it as off-topic .

  it is still way less than normal social security . 
  what , you can be socialist without being a communist ? 
  / s i mean europe is so socialist that it is communist / s. 
  the usual suspects of high quality newspapers  . 
  the usual suspects are bbc , theguardian and the nytimes , however there are many decent national newspapers in europe like dw.com , derspielgel.de or elpais . 
  there are also transnational newspapers/online newssites like politico.eu and economist.com . 
  this is just the newspapers and news sites that i read , but there are many more . 
  try this link : http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/05/how-islam-created-europe/476388/, 
  could you directly link to it ? 
  i also have to admit to asking a question on thesub  . 
  i can recommend trying to get on / r/subredditoftheday , / r/tinysubredditoftheday , / r/heycomevisitoursub and of course casually commenting on other subs  . 
  a new subreddit is alot of mod content in the beginning , you should do it a lot , it helps to set the tone of a subreddit .

  sorry , i had to remove it , the other post was already borderline , but this one has very little to do with the continent , but cudos for trying to create a sub where people can have diverging opions without getting banned for being a `` bernibot '' or a `` trumpfanaticsuperhater '' . 
  just one quetion , how do you define shilling , it is always rather hard to proof in my opinion .

  you are right , and those workers do n't even have to eat and drink and do n't need a place to sleep , they work all day and night !, 
  because it is cheaper not to have to serve a second menue without pork , capitalsim  . 
  also i can not say i would miss any premade pork menues , chicken is pretty great and in my opinion better than pork .

  it is just notorious for being able to sue the shit out of people in civil court . 
  you also have to be alive to be elected  . 
  funny story if you are a descended of the habsburg family you can not be elected as the president of austria !,

  this action is completly pointless but i gues it is a nice gesture ... 
  since when is merkle anywhere close to supreme leader , sure she is the head of state of the biggest country in the eu and has a lot of clout that way and people are looking to her for leadership . 
  but if germany got whatever it wanted the eu would look very differently !, 
  it is kinda dead law , nobody uses it , at least till now also the government has to ask so a person could be prosecuted which is really odd so everybody scrambles to figure out what to do . 
  there are statistics that show that immigrants to the uk pay more taxes and take way social security money so you are completely wrong on this point . 
  i would call it a crime against humanity that erdogan has never heared of the streisand effect !, 
  sory , i forgot the / s , i thought it was possible to read it from the dots . 
  well , i also tend to be cynical , but this woman has to commended , she was truely brave and did the right thing . 
  so you want benefits without working for them , accepting some drawbacks , certain stereotypes ... . small number of refugees in comparison to other countries = dumping ground, 
  who is calling for the destruction of the israeli state ? 
  neo nazis , common you are dishonest , germany is pushing acceptance of the palestina state ie . 
  a two state solution . 
  gdp is an income i.e. 
  how much a country produces each year , while dept is capital , so you are comparing apple and oranges . 
  i would like to know how you get to 20 % employment rate by immigrants . 
  you could maybe get there by including children , people in pensions and people unable to work plus the next unborn generation but i just do n't see how they could support themselfs with such a low ammount of employment . 
  i do n't think you get this position by being friend of a single position , all the other states would never accept somebody incompetent . 
  you are pretending the eu is doing the sanctions because they think it is fun and games . 
  the eu is doing them because they are best tool to punish russia for their `` tourist soldiers '' and/or force russia to reconsider their invastion on another sovreign nation . 
  why does the eu have a special beef with russia ? 
  because it all happend around a trade contract singing between eu and ukraine and it is a fight about influence . 
  sure , screaming murder when a muslim is mention is opposing radical islam ... . 
  please do n't spam copy pasta . 
  not really , the law in question is about insulting foreign heads of state and it is really weird so nobody is really sure how to use it . 
  it really sounds like you need help , here is a list of telefone helplines you can call completely anonymous and there will be always somebody willing to listen to you . 
  [ helplines ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch/wiki/hotlines ) if you want to write , there is https://www.reddit.com/r/depression and i think there is also a chat channel on snoonet ( irc ) called #depression where people are willing to listen . 
  i hope that any of those sources help , but best would be probably be if you find psychological assistance , you should be able to talk with your doctor about options .

  is there some , if possible neutral place where i could read up on the proposed reforms ? 
  i do n't think that news reports are omnipressence , not every tiem something goes wrong it is malfisence , but rather incompetence . 
  sometimes you have to run with the best information you have . 
  yes , also the eu is much closer to iran and will benefit the most of a new trade partner because of it .
