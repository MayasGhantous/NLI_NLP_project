  well , iran and us are stil shaky , eu is much more neutral and they primarily care about the nuclear weapns and way less about philosophical issues , although i am sure the eu would be happy if the country would develope into more of a real democracy . 
  i would compare mohamed more with moses , both are prophets . 
  they are almost invisible all over europe and are well integrated , like almost all groups who have been here for some time . 
  i do n't get it , so what if the source is somewhere else ? 
  do the french farmers not want to compete ? 
  also if you look up eu law , it basically says if you are allowed to sell something in one country you are allowed to sell it in any country .

  selling old military junk to a country is also cooperation  . 
  also gradual could be from 10 to 10000 years , it will depend on the development of ukraine over the next few years . 
  but france invented merkantilism , which is like the opposite of free trade . 
  so sweeping under the rug the what is done by people who lived longer in a land is fine then , okay i understand you ... 
  wikipedia articles on political charged articles on wikipedia are hilariously unreliable . 
  it is sad but it is so . 
  to be honest it is also a conservative/christian value to help people in need . 
  hi , it means a person who just comments on a single issue , just posts on a singel issue and is n't really a member of the community and more a troll than anything . 
  so , do i understand you correctly ? 
  you want to get payed more , work less and be unfireable ? 
  or am i not understanding you correctly , please explain it to me . 
  just pointing out , but you are comparing a book with people atm ...

  the us is apparently managing it and it would be issued by local governments like they are currently done , but would be eu ones .
