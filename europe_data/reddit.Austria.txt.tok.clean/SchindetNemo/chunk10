  [ there is a movement ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bayernpartei ) , but it 's only 4000 men strong .

  i confused the dates , it happened in the 20s . 
  [ however , in 1926 belgium and the weimar republic conducted secret negotiations which would have led to the return of the east cantons to germany in return for 200 million gold marks - but the fury of the french government on hearing about the plan led to the break-up of the talks .

  germany wanted to buy them back in the 60s already but the plan got vetoed by france .

  it 's illegal to give wine to civil servants , employees of the state and anyone working in the healthcare system .

  that 's actually illegal over here . 
  short answer : carinthia is our texas . 
  long answer : carinthia used to be part of a slavic principality until it was conquered by charlemagne in the 8th century ad and colonised by ethnic germans until the slavs were completely replaced by the 13th century . 
  after the austrian defeat in the napoleonic wars , napoleon formed the kingdom of illyria which resembled the ancient slavic principality and included german carinthia and styria to weaken the habsburgs , but had the unfortunate side effect of rekindling ancient rivalries and claims for the land . 
  now , when the break-up of the crumbling habsburg monarchy was imminent after ww1 , the ethnic german parts split from illyria and asked to be annexed by the newly formed austrian republic . 
  the slovenes were n't very fond of that unfortunately and decided to invade and take the lands by force . 
  since the austrian army was busy with a little civil war we had going on at the time and carinthia was n't yet part of the country , the population had to fight a bloody guerilla war to fend of the slavs . 
  this event has burned itself into the collective memory of carinthians and influenced their politics ever since . 
  fuelled by the recent events carinthians grew increasingly xenophobic and racist . 
  unsurprisingly , they were very eager to adopt hitler 's new racial doctrines . 
  when he finally took over , he had overwhelming support in the state . 
  around this time the state started to try to suppress the identity of austrian slovenes . 
  the pseudo ethnicity of `` windisch '' was created along with the `` windish language '' so austrian slovenes wo n't associate themselves with other slavs in the hopes that the minority will assimilate completely and simply vanish . 
  unfortunately this xenophobic trend did n't stop after the second world war . 
  instead of purging the openly racist people on top , they mass emigrated to the social democratic party and simply continued where they 've left off . 
  while the second austrian republic reintroduced the old constitutional rights for minorities , the state of carinthia refused to follow along . 
  the first landeshauptmann ( think american governor ) proudly proclaimed that carinthia is nationalist first and socialist second and simply ignored all orders . 
  bi lingual schools were closed down , bi lingual government papers were never issued and people speaking `` windisch '' were heavily discriminated against , for example if you wanted to name your kid `` matja\u017e '' civil servants refused to hand out a birth certificate unless you registered your son as a properly germanised `` matthias '' . 
  hell , that guy even founded a successor organisation to the hitler youth . 
  because the federal social democrats were constantly criticising their carinthian sub faction and the federal republic generally became too friendly with foreigners during the mid 80s one now infamous carinthian named j\u00f6rg haider took over a liberal democratic party and turned it into a right wing populist party so they could continue to openly spout their xenophobia , which now included muslims and brown people , without any repercussions . 
  and this is the reason why carinthains get so much shit from other austrians . 
  carinthia is a beautiful state ruined by old people who ca n't get over something that happened 90 years ago . 
  the state is still extremely xenophobic and austrian slovenes are still discriminated against . 
  politicians down there are stuck in the past . 
  it 's so absurd that other austrians make fun of carinthians whenever they meet one . 
  the situation is getting better though . 
  the 20 + generation does n't give a shit about any of that . 
  you 're just bitter because you are n't aryan .

  do you have any air force bases with experimental aircraft in the east ? 
  could be that civilians are confusing those with ufos . 
  germany 's using a base in new mexico for that iirc after a lot of their tornados crashed in populated areas , which would explain why there are comparatively few sightings despite their similar size . 
  i love that even aliens from light years away know that carinthia is best to be avoided .

  it was weird . 
  the teutonic knights did n't turn eastwards towards russia in my game but started attacking a german duke that got excommunicated right at the start of the game . 
  poland made peace with the to pretty early because they had to focus on the golden horde who were overrunning them in the east . 
  i created the austro-hungarian-ottoman empire once , but that did n't last long . 
  i got excommunicated by the pope for marrying my heir to a muslim princess . 
  france , germany which was united by the teutonic order 30 years prior and poland-lithuania then decided to stop the war they were fighting with each other to team up on me . 
  austria was annexed by germany , hungary was annexed by romania and the ottoman empire fell to the golden horde who conquered their way westwards from india .

  why are you welsh so obsessed with bestiality ? 
  yes but the pagan imagery was largely replaced . 
  krampus and perchta still are the same as they were in pre christian times . 
  both befana and the st. lucy tradition originate from the south germanic goddess [ perchta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perchta ) who still accompanies st. nicholas in some parts of austria . 
  she would originally visit kids on the night after the twelfth december to reward good kids and slit open the bellies of bad ones . 
  early christians tried to replace her with christian saints but were n't completely successful, 
  an oachkatzlschwoaf , so we can continue teasing germans for not being able to pronounce that word . 
  he was a good diplomat , does n't mean he was a nice person or always right . 
  it 's the other way around over here . 
  krampus comes first and st. nicholas second . 
  otherwise i assume it 's the same myth minus the golden switch . 
  bavarians only have cheap toned down knock offs named pelzebock that wo n't even touch you . 
  unless you visit styria or tyrol on december 5th you 'll be fine . 
  while it 's not really a christmas tradition since it 's celebrated on december 5th and originates in pre-christian pagan rituals , my favourite tradition is still the [ krampuslauf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krampus ) .

  emergency operations like heart transplants happen after a couple of hours , non essential operations usually happen in less than three months . 
  the only kind of operation with absurd waiting times i know of is plastic surgery ( for trophy wifes not for burn victims ) , which can take up to a year . 
  although those are carried out by private surgeons and are n't paid for by any insurance .

  austria : * ** strangers ** : handshake ; when being introduced kisses for w + w and w + m * ** relatives ** : kisses w + m and w + w ; handshakes m + m * ** friends ** : kisses w + m and w + w ; handshakes m + m * ** business partners ** : handshake * ** m + w ** : kiss * ** w + w ** : kiss * ** m + m ** : handshake * ** how many kisses ? 
  ** :2 * ** cheek , mouth , air , hand ** : cheek and air ; very rarely hand for m + w * ** after how much time of not seeing each other ? 
  ** : no rule, 
  it 's the other way around .
