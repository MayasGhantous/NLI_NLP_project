  barth is the worst . 
  what are you doing on the internet . 
  get back to your unit and shoot me some bolsheviks . 
  they have militaristic party uniforms they like to wear . 
  in lieu of the brown shirts in austria and germany or the black shirts in italy . 
  greenland has left the back then ec over a dispute over fishing rights . 
  we do n't have national id cards either . 
  you could theoretically order one , but it 's entirely optional and barely anyone has one . 
  most likely because they are as expensive as they are redundant , they are glorified ssn cards with a picture on them . 
  we use our driver 's licenses and ssns instead . 
  most people have no idea who guevara even is . 
  they just wear his face on shirts because it 's `` hip '' . 
  just like a lot of people suddenly think guy fawkes was a freedom fighter because they 've seen some guy with the same name in a film . 
  read his name backwards . 
  he 's txampion , a known troll that got banned a few weeks ago . 
  he 's a troll , of course not . 
  to be fair , british tabloids hate * everyone * . 
  i apologise for not being a prussian \u00dcbermensch . 
  in front of a theatre harassing the patrons of course . 
  there were proposals for an eu army already in the 50s . 
  they got vetoed by the uk iirc . 
  it 's not like they did n't try . 
  we do n't disagree , i meant \u00d63 and the state specific radios . 
  i do n't listen to them , but i have nothing against \u00d61 or fm4 . 
  remember the orf reform a few years back ? 
  that pretty awful telenovela they tried to make ? 
  i was refering to things like that . 
  while donnerstag nacht was pretty great when scheuba was still in it , it became a lot worse over the years . 
  i guess was gibt es neues is ok as well , but all * really * great shows they come up with like die 4 da , sendung ohne namen or even project x get canceled fairly quickly and are replaced with trash tv like chili . 
  germans have it worse no doubt but the orf right now is n't worth the 20-25 eur we pay per month , especially not the public radios . 
  you call that bad ? 
  take a look at our [ rates ] ( https://www.gis.at/gebuehren/gebuehrentabelle/ ) . 
  and we get nothing in return for it besides one fairly decent documentary series, 
  no need to torrent . 
  zdf is [ streaming ] ( http://www.zdf.de/zdfmediathek/kanaluebersicht/aktuellste/180#/kanaluebersicht/180/ ) its documentaries . 
  that show is basically the proof that zombies do in fact exist . 
  at least you get * something * for your tv extortion money . 
  we get universum and shows that get canceled after 3-6 episodes . 
  i think the worst thing that would happen would be the expulsion of greece from the eu , who in turn would be forced to default without the financial support of the other member states . 
  europe is n't militaristic enough anymore for all out war . 
  we 've lost too much in the last couple of wars we had and the memories are still vivid . 
  i do n't know about greece , but we have police trucks with mounted water cannons that shoot high pressured capsaicin ( the active ingredient in pepper spray ) laced water . 
  `` specialized spray '' might refer to that . 
  i doubt history would repeat itself . 
  we are n't governed by senile old monarchs with delusions of grandeur and a loose trigger finger anymore . 
  no , i mean if paramedics actually stole some organs before or if people were just paranoid . 
  does that actually happen ? 
  `` there are people who do much worse things '' that should be the motto of berlusconi 's party . 
  touch\u00e9 . 
  austrian assholes usually do n't murder their sisters in honour killings or blow themself up in vienna 's jewish district . 
  did she step on the verse on purpose or by accident ? 
  the entire concept of a civil war with immigrants is ridiculous . 
  we still got armies . 
  i doubt they 'll side with the immigrants in case of a civil war . 
  almost right . 
  we did n't declare ourselves first victim of national socialism , the allies did . 
  they needed an armed buffer state in the middle of europe and wanted to prevent austria turning communist like chechoslovakia did a few years before we regained our independence . 
  we were declared a `` secret ally '' and were rearmed by ' 55 . 
  additionaly , austrian nationalism as well as historical revisionism was encouraged to make sure we wo n't have any sympathies for germans . 
  south tyrolean nationalism never went anywhere , other people just stopped to care . 
  one of their mottos i believe is `` south tyrol is not italy '' . 
  ~ ~ those were n't bisons but aurochs , that 's a slightly different species . ~ ~ scratch that , i 'm an idiot . 
  blond and blue eyed socks . 
  it 's better than the bog standard red-white-red , which kinda looks like we ripped off latvia . 
  yellow and black are fairly rare colours on flags . 
  i 'm quite fond of the [ black and yellow flag ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/flag_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.svg/500px-flag_of_the_habsburg_monarchy.svg.png ) of the habsburg empire myself . 
  the scariest thing by far would be surstr\u00f6mming . 
  seems my info was out of date then . 
  sorry about that . 
  germanic countries are in the middle of the [ european beer belt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alcohol_belts_of_europe ) where cereals grow the best , hence beer has become the main beverage . 
  they do n't , they use internet explorer . 
  seriously , knowing how to start solitair does n't really count as being tech savvy . 
  you 're confusing socialism with communism . 
  most if not all european social democratic parties abandoned class struggle after they saw what happened in russia . 
  the austrain parliament is broadcasting their meetings every sunday . 
  every time my dad turns them on you see 2/3 of the mps playing solitair or surfing the net . 
  is n't mussolini 's granddaughter a politician in northern italy ? 
  j\u00f6rg haider is dead , slovenians are safe for now . 
  all politicians are corrupt , some just hide it better than others . 
  i think they want to replace nicknames with people 's real names . 
  kind of like they do it in south korea . 
  on what exactly ? 
  we wanted to be part of germany in the beginning though . 
  if the allies would n't have forbidden it in 1918 we would have ended up as a german state most likely . 
  the english version was never that good to begin with . 
  it also does n't help that the official national mantra is `` i do n't care '' and that our sports minister is a moron . 
  they did n't sell them to israel , they `` gifted '' them . 
  during the last war israel accused germany of supporting the opposing side and the only way germany could prove her innocence was to gift them 2 subs and sell them 3 more for quarter the price . 
  they tried a similar thing with austria but we declined iirc . 
  all remnant states of austria-hungary would get extremely pissed if we 'd call it that . 
  we 're not really fond of monarchies . 
  you did n't get rid of the fascists after franco ? 
  that 's a bit disturbing to be honest . 
  there 's more to fascism than military worship and swearing an oath every day . 
  but i agree that the us is constantly moving to the right . 
  compare the republican party of the 70s to the current republican party . 
  only on the internet unfortunately . 
  germany is n't . 
  let 's take south tyrol and silesia back while we 're at it . 
  it 's ok , just let germany bail you out with karma loans .
