  eastern austria checking in , i also know a ton of horvaths . 
  you had a great run as noipmaxt , took them forever to get the idea of reading your name backwards . 
  mine is a shitty pun on the german title of finding nemo : findet nemo . 
  `` schinden '' used to be a way to execute a person in the middle ages but the meaning changed a bit in modern german . 
  to `` schind '' someone to death nowadays means to give someone else so much work or such a burden to bear that he 's slowly grinding him or herself to death . 
  schindet nemo basically means abuse nemo . 
  i 've used this nickname on the internet and in videogames since morrowind goty came out in 2003 . 
  the title would n't be a polandball pun if he had n't heard about polandball, 
  what 's wrong with your labour market ? 
  you are joking , but the kp\u00d6 received 20 % in graz . 
  not because they are particularly communistic but because the head of the party there donates every cent he earns as a politician to poor people . 
  he 's one of the few people with ideals who can resist the corruption of power . 
  also , you might want to x-post this to / r/austria . 
  the sub is slow , but far from dead . 
  give it a day or two . 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  all of our parties are a joke . 
  the greens live in their own fantasy world , the sp\u00d6 sit on their asses doing nothing for fear of alienating potential voters , the \u00d6vp stall everything and then blame everyone else for it , fp\u00d6 and bz\u00d6 are out of the question for obvious reasons and team stronach is pretty much a collection of austria 's most incompetent and most corrupt politicians since all of them were bought . 
  & # 3232 ;\\ _ & # 3232 ; the comment section of that site is just awful . 
  can we join ? 
  i promise we 'll only claim to be victims if we lose . 
  viennese people speak standard austrian german . 
  you and every other foreigner learned standard german german in school . 
  adapt or piss off . 
  support of rampant social darwinism ? 
  cull the weak attitude ? 
  support of draconian punishments ? 
  yeah , you sound like someone from an older period . 
  the period from 1933 to 1945 to be exact . 
  in the same sense as someone who ca n't stop watching a train wreck . 
  maybe everyone thinks you 're a troll because you sound like a bloody fascist . 
  would you drop your native accent just because some foreigner demands that you have to adapt to him and not the other way around ? 
  vienna is n't hamburg . 
  we were the easternmost part charlemagne colonised, 
  north and south holland are two states in the netherlands that are used as a pars pro toto for the entire nation . 
  `` african migration background '' is n't politically correct either . 
  people north of the sahara are n't black and there are a ton of descendants of white colonists south of the sahara . 
  pc newspeak makes no sense , there 's always something that will offend someone else . 
  remember how they changed our national anthem because it 's supposedly sexist despite being written by a woman ? 
  charming . . 
  / r/paradoxplaza / r/polandball / r/nottheonion / r/crappymusic / r/conspiratard, 
  this is n't about the right to homeschool your children , this is about the right to brainwash your children . 
  even if they 'd manage to get one of those extremely rare homeschool permits in germany , they 'd still have to report in once or twice a year to make sure the normal curriculum is still taught and their children are n't denied their education . 
  i assume something similar is in place in belgium . 
  those conditions are hardly unreasonable unless you 're a religious nutjob . 
  i ca n't stand the fp\u00d6 and i would never vote for them , but they are certainly no nazis . 
  they use xenophobia to get votes from old people and for some strange reason austrian serbians but they are not working to re-implement fascism . 
  we had an outright neo-nazi party , but unlike their german sister party , they were outlawed in the 80s . 
  there are no `` good '' nations out there , everyone is a different shade of grey . 
  history is written by the victors . 
  if the ussr would n't have been part of the allies i 'm sure stalin 's crimes like the holodomor would n't have been so downplayed by history . 
  [ google is your friend ] ( http://lmgtfy.com/?q=giyf ), 
  it will . 
  it 's the older generation who gets people elected . 
  just look at our last referendum on conscription . 
  the age 60 + generation completely fucked the age 18 + generation over . 
  the media over here often calls belarus `` europe 's last dictatorship '' , is it really that bad ? 
  how is life for the average citizen ? 
  i can confirm that . 
  it made sense for the first decade after the war . 
  no , but his has two kids who lead his media empire now . 
  and they share their father 's views . 
  you can hear his spawn very clearly though . 
  seems like all that dichand propaganda is n't as efficient as i thought . 
  so are we . 
  i hereby officially invite you to stay in my basement . 
  do you live in ex-lombardy-venetia ? 
  if so , we can talk about you being re-annexed and coming home . 
  just make sure to take south tyrol with you . 
  was n't the lire devalued to death ? 
  they really want back to that ? 
  if you want out , chances are pretty high that you do n't belong to the pro-berlusconi faction . 
  you do n't have army personnel standing next to the ballots threatening the voters for you like that other guy . 
  he seems to have some kind of feud going on with / u/turnusb . 
  i do n't know what it 's about though since they switch to portuguese whenever they meet . 
  the austrian government supports this notion and demands a surprise anschluss with a 98 % majority . 
  estonia big !, 
  happy independence day . 
  you 're doing it wrong . 
  the harder you try to win the worse your final score gets . 
  do it like us or eastern europe : release some [ think wrongs ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzjt6gv4xpk ) from the asylum and send them over . 
  they 'll win easily . 
  if something like that happens they mostly retcon the character to be danish . 
  elliot read from scrubs was turned into a dane as well . 
  do n't tell / r/conspiracy . 
  i think you 've won . 
  [ everything in poland is upside down ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lrvre.png ), 
  the american tourists i 've met over here were all terribly scared of offending someone . 
  i do n't know how they behave elsewhere , but if you call that uncivil you 've obviously never experienced the kind of rich russian oligarchs that invade europe lately . 
  the same used to be true in austrian ski resorts , but brits have been recently replaced by russians . 
  those are even worse . 
  [ german can be soft too . 
  ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-zo0jw3yp8 ), 
  that name sounds more austrian than german to be honest . 
  ( english : hoid hoid hoid die goschn ), 
  ( english : ~ ~ this time without italy . ~ ~ lovely weather we 're having . ), 
  i always thought that 's vienna [ since ] ( http://wienerschmankerl.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/wien_anders2.jpg ), 
  ^ ^ muss ^ ^ die ^ ^ n\u00e4he ^ ^ zur ^ ^ steiermark ^ ^ sein ( english translation : we are totally not planning ww3 . 
  do n't worry about it . ), 
  i 'm a slow stupid inbred farmer who talks like he 's barking and have no clue about fancy viennese high culture .
