beautiful , you can even see the alps . 
  but ... but ... it 's even `` breaking news '' ( ! ), 
  ugh , finally . 
  about time . . 
  do you guys get confused with austria a lot ? 
  i 'm fine with the south of tyrol too . 
  i hope we 're getting triest back . 
  maybe wait till the actual election ? 
  no , we do n't need another try with a cherrypicking halfcommitted soon to be ex-memberstate . 
  so why not leave the eu and join the eea ? 
  maybe we should go ahead with this `` multi-speed eu '' idea . 
  seems like `` trumpism '' is n't very well received in europe ? 
  oh i ca n't wait till the second round of the french election . 
  i 'm fine with answering clickbait headlines . 
  you know , you can just leave . . ? 
  ^ ^ please ? 
  berlin . 
  you know , like before the brexit . 
  let 's use words like upper/lower house and prime minister , so even brits will get it ? 
  ca n't wait till some regional parliament blocks it . 
  `` real-time brexit monitor '' or as we like to call it : / r/europe, 
  but there is still his ... wurst . 
  third time 's a charm . 
  ca n't tell if porn magazine or sun ? 
  well , draw some breasts on it then , and it will be fine . 
  glorious austrian empire ^ ^ and ^ ^ hungary, 
  so ... no . 
  case closed . 
  do we give a fuck about the philippines ? 
  if yes , why ? 
  i not . 
  seems accurate .

  pretty sure the scots get cold feet on election day again . 
  thank you , random orthography bot . 
   prof l\u00f6nnqvist suggested right-wing politicians could be better looking because physical attractiveness could have more of an influence on the selection of candidates in conservative parties . 
  well ... 
  for stupid voters it actually is an important factor . 
  hahahahaha . 
  especially odd since iron man is a marvel franchise . 
  but perhaps we will see an iron lady section in uk-land ? 
  `` scarlett johansson fast nackt '' might be the more important headline . 
   paramount is behind films such as titanic , the transformers series , iron man and forrest gump . 
  well , that 's ... something . 
  ha joke is on them , germans do n't need apartments to get drunk !, 
  who needs radical muslims when you got natives like that ? 
  why should he ? 
   `` american ''  `` lads '', 
  well if they do n't go back voluntary we force them to ? 
  like we currently do ... do you guys really do n't know how to deport people ? 
  well thats the problem , there is no eu asylum system it 's still a matter of the member states . 
  the long game is to temporarily shelter them until we can send them back . 
  you know it was - our - idea to close the so called balkan route ? 
  a multinational survey that is . 
  i know national surveys about that question , no surveys with participant from all over the developed world . 
  why is the nyt always so dramatic ? 
  wait , there is a actual survey for that , or are you just pulling out numbers out of your a. . behind ? 
  according to whom ? 
  great . 
  well , ca n't argue with a bus . 
  the `` turkey of the seas '' . 
  death penalty ?

  thanks to germany 's left/green government . 
  bad for germany , but not exactly our concern . 
  do you guys have pakistani-quotas , tho ? 
  it 's not like these people turn around and go back when they see a closed border , border controls are mainly an inconvenience for the ordinary lawful citizen . 
  took us a while to close the balkan route . 
  seems like `` a '' is home for easter ? 
  not really a choice when slowenia/italy keeps sending them up , and germany sending them down . 
  british papers , it 's kind of buzzfeed for old people . 
  well , good bye . 
  have fun with trump . 
   at that time , the rise of austrian far-right leader j\u00f6rg haider was a big worry for mainstream eu leaders well ... how 's life now ? 
  the eu has to act in the interest of it 's 27 remaining member states , not in the interest of quitters . 
   i guess they 're still gon na play the `` solidarity and no cherry picking '' card though . 
  well maybe cause , this net payer already took 100.000 + asylum seekers , unlike other countries . 
  and ... ? 
  thank you anti-vaxxers . 
  kontext ? 
  threat ? 
  how is this a threat ? 
  we use it ironic , as a joke . 
  with the amount of brexit newspaper articles every day , you should consider renaming this sub to `` brexit news '' . 
   despite brexit uncertainty maybe we all should wait till britain finally leaves ? 
  question is : are there mass abortions in times of national disasters ? 
   march 12 , 2007 seems like german bureaucrats are ** really ** slow . 
  thank god someone removed that shitpost , made less sense than farrages tie . 
  guess snow will be cheaper . 
  well , maltese are white , quite hairy , very little , and really loud for their size . 
  the ugliest tie ever . 
  seriously , who dresses this man ? 
  well , he was - born - austrian , lost the austrian citizenship , and gained german citizenship in 1932 , technically hitler was both austrian and german . 
  does n't really matter , since he was a ** german ** chancellor . 
  unfortunately comments in german language media are n't any better . 
  guess somebody visited that donald subreddit lately ?
