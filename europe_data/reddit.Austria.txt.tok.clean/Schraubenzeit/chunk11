  all onboard the kurzzug !, 
  next stop : chancellery ~ ~ hohe ~ ~ ** geile energie **, 
   saying this is the end of the eu wait ... what ? 
  they might overestimate the power of the austrian vice chancellor, 
  and which countries got the same gdp as benelux ? 
  the guy next door is hitler , i f *** ing knew it !, 
  you have to explain yourself herr schicklgruber !, 
  what kind of uprising ? 
  all onboard the kurzzug next stop : chancellery ~ ~ geile ~ ~ hohe energie !, 
  binden, 
  he seems very british to be honest . 
  the walking distance from the louvre palace to the pyramide is two `` ode to joy `` s long . 
  and who is this guy ? 
  hehe , exactly like the german said ... `` but muh microbreweries '', 
  good for them . 
  did n't say there are n't any microbrews in europe , just said european breweries have such high standards there is no * need * to have them , except maybe to spice things up a bit . 
  papst blue ribbon , budweiser ( not to be confused with the real budweiser from budvar - and please do n't get me started with all that `` bud '' crap ) , coors , miller and so on . 
  to be fair , i rather have a beer from europe . 
  ( does n't matter if from austria , czechia , belgium or germany ), 
  capitalistic communists !, 
  on the other hand , european breweries are so good there is no need for independent microbreweries . 
  ( altho they are nice to have of course ), 
  c for capitalism !, 
  waterfest ? 
  american beer at the oktoberfest in munich ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  well , let them special snowflakes be special . 
  in my town federal buildings have the austrian and the eu flag hoisted . 
   that said , eu has to change if we want to stop this wave i would say the wave never really came . 
  it 's not like populism suddenly popped up in europe , it was always here . 
  but that is true , the eu needs to step up it 's game . 
  well , there is a lot of salt now , 
  2005 is 12 years ago , so not really a newcomer . 
  fun fact , the pvv had once 24 seats , compared to the 20 now . 
  actually 15 years ago they did , it was fn charman jean-marie le pen , father of marine le pen who ascended to the second round . 
  right wing populism is n't something new to europe it 's been here since ages . 
  there will always be small victories like getting to the second round or winning one seat or two . 
  but a `` right revolution '' like some non-european users thought ? 
  not really . 
  what ? 
  wilders was n't unknown before , nor was le pen . 
  they are in politics since decades . 
   beethoven was flattered by the adoration of vienna , so the ninth symphony was premiered on ** 7 may ** 1824 in the theater am k\u00e4rntnertor in vienna https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symphony_no._9_%28beethoven%29#premiere, 
  so . . thats a yes to salt ? 
  depends on the candidate and the competition to be honest . 
  a runoff against a far-right and a far-left candidate like 2016 , or a election between a far-right and a centre-left like 2010 . 
  what are they going to use ? 
  salt ? 
  you do n't elect parties in the austrian presidential election , but candidates backed by parties . 
  well , she got 21.3 % of the votes in round one , compared to 17.9 % in 2012 . 
  populist might do better on competitions against only one candidate , compared to rounds with many . 
   sincerely , your children and grandchildren . 
  how old are you again ? 
  no data on hofer for 2012 , le pen did n't made the second round , wilders party won +5 seats compared to 2012, 
  except hofer who actually lost by a bigger margin the second time . 
  populism is giving people what they want . 
  apparently a \u00d6xit seems a bit unsexy right now . 
  after austria , netherlands , now france could n't live up to the expectations of right wingers . 
  so , let 's recap ... hofer did n't win in austria , wilders party came second in the netherlands , le pen lost in france . 
  so much for the right-wing populist hypetrain in europe . 
  to be fair , the french eat pepes , so not really a surprise . . 
  so , let 's recap ... hofer did n't win in austria , wilders party came second in the netherlands , le pen lost in france . 
  next up : germany where the two biggerst parties are led by merkel and schulz , a former president of the eu parliament . 
  well ... great night tonight . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zg4iq/french_election_dick_eating_bet/ just leaving that here . . 
  what ? 
  or , even better , we anschluss them . 
  on the eve of the election , does anyone remember this litte gem : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5zg4iq/french_election_dick_eating_bet/ ? 
  or , even better , make austria-hungary again . 
  if the want access to the market they should join the eea . 
  i like him . 
  junker seems to do n't give a f ** k at all . 
  lol, 
  someone edited a wikipedia page . 
  wow . 
  why not ? 
  after all french is one of the eu working languages , plus there are the french election comming up . 
  why should he talk to the french people in english ? 
  the president of the commission held statement in one of the three working languages of the eu . 
  should have used german . 
  or she could lose by a even bigger margin , that could happen too . 
  looks like someone discovered ms paint . 
  gratulations . 
  and who are irelands real friends ? 
  but ... 
  the balloon filled with hot air ( or in this case helium ) symbolizises populists , and instead of destroying the euro ( note ) it 's taking it with them . 
  thats a pretty clever political commentary . 
  only 13 percentage points to go !, 
  so the bar for sunday is set at : at least she 's gon na be a strong second ? 
  well , good to see people are lowering their expectations after the right-populist hypetrain last year . 
  now for the first time ever the remaining eu members have a common ( external ) ~ ~ enemy ~ ~ antagonist , that could indeed bring them closer together . 
  yes . 
  berlin . 
  there will be salt on sunday . 
  2006 and 2008-2010, 
  actually we did take a break for several years . 
  right , they should do this in german . 
  right , they should do this in german . 
  the ratings are quite good , after all they ~ ~ annoy us with ~ ~ advertise the eurovision contest months in advance . 
  competition results are a whole different story .
