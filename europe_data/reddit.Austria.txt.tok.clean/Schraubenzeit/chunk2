  president of the european council is n't a position were someone could `` lead '' much . 
  it 's basically a moderator job . 
  mayby - not - behaving like 5 year olds after 27 government leaders elected tusk als ec president , might help a bit . 
  sooo . . half baked globalists ? 
   in a protectionist customs union and no free movement for the rest of the world so brexiters are actually globalists ? 
  do the donaldfans know ? 
  damn furries . 
  was n't it rather to - stay - in an union with england , since they joint like 310 years ago ? 
  cause japan is n't getting on our nerves . 
  austrians at the time saw themselves as part of a bigger german community , going so far that post wwi austria tried to join the weimar republic . 
  there might have been an independence movement , maybe , but not as big as in scotland or catalonia today . 
  like a turkey under erdogan had any chance to become a eu member . 
  yeah . . what a shocker . 
  how so ? 
  do n't you brits have exemptions en masse anyway ? 
  did n't mean the people on the pic . 
  genius idea , so people will flood into austria just to get money to go back . 
  take that swedish welfare state . 
  `` best at drinking beer '' well , gratulations czechia . 
  ca n't be the only one here who is glad we do n't have to deal with that `` special litte snowflake '' type of member-country . 
  poland and hungary cause enough trouble to be honest . 
  well , bye then . 
  close the door please . 
  or a recent switch to a system that requires an overlord , from a non-overlord system . 
  i wonder what he keeps in his utility belt . . 
  well to be fair , it 's the only logical choice . 
  rome ? 
  do they even have money for that ? 
   willing to join prussia hahahahahahahaha no . 
   ready to come to your rescue from problems probably caused by germany . 
  soooo ... shitposts are allowed again ? 
  austria : creative , individual , colourful , playful germany : orderly , serious , boring , uniformly, 
  so he could free the slavs . 
  well , it 's dark up there .

  we 're now economically and politically sucking up to a country our monarchs once ruled . 
  one might find certain similarities . 
  * former empire, 
  do you want butthurt brits ? 
  cause that is how you get butthurt brits .

  hahahahaha . 
  see , brexit will be great . 
  well border controlls will be a pain in the a , then . 
  glorious ~ ~ germany ~ ~ europe . 
  planing through the air . 
  austria - bestria ... and hungary is nice too i guess . 
  you know , there are things we are calling `` airplanes '' . 
  down with these traitors to the glorious empire . 
  they like germans as much as we do . 
  ok . deleted that post , made a new one . 
  the kingdoms and lands represented in the imperial council and the lands of the crown of saint stephen ?

  right , europe does n't even exist , it 's just western eurasia . 
  yep . 
  been there , done that . 
  now we 're economically and politically hanging on germany , a place our monarchs once ruled . 
  one might see some similarities here ... 
  well ... it 's something . 
  well , it 's still an enourmous amount of people for a country like austria , that is n't nowhere as big as let 's say poland or romania , or even germany or france . 
  is n't there a resettlement mechanism in place so refugees would be distributed across the eu ? 
  ~ 90.000 in 2015 42.000 in 2016 , so pretty much i would say . 
  sure . 
  better pull them out before it 's a bloody deaster like hypo alpe adria . 
  from glorious empire to ( possibly ) crumbling kingdom in just about 100 years . 
  how many again ? 
  well if you could provide us a recent , and more specific , statistic about this subject , go ahead . 
  well , unlike some other `` totally non racist , but we rather not take muslims '' - states we actually did take refugees . 
  well yugoslavia does n't exist since years now , still statisticians count them as one ... 
   we accepted refugees . 
  how many , tho ? 
  especially the visegrad states are n't exactly very `` open '' to that idea . 
   you should have blocked our entry in the eu and be done with the whining if we 're such a burden to austria . 
  there where actually plans to do that . 
  but well , peer pressure . 
  pretty sure the austrian job market would do better ...

  well maybe the project eu is n't just about funding less developed memberstates in the east , maybe we expect a litte solidary in return i.e. 
  in the refugee crisis . 
  maybe some memberstates want further integration without countries that constantly holding them back . 
  who knows ? 
  from : https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:austrian_empire_1815.svg, 
  why would the even want to rejoin if many brits could enjoy the privileges of eu citizenship without the need for a membership ? 
  well , currently we are dealing with an enormous amount of foreign workers from eastern europe . 
  pretty sure the enlargement had at least something to do with it . 
  back to the eu - ~ ~ 15 ~ ~ 14 !, 
  since there already are forms of eu wide work and residence permits , there is no need to grant eu citizenship to citizens of non-memberstates, 
  like a residence permit ? 
  well of course they do , without the american involvement in wwii they surely would speak german now . 
  why would you offer something like that to a non-memberstate ? 
  would n't make sense , citizens of memberstates are already eu citizens . 
  no need to opt in . 
  well , so far britain is the only quitter now . 
  oh , great , another extra deal for britain . 
  which one of them are the `` neo-fascists '' ? 
   however , we have to consider how to regulate the jobs market , how to combat social dumping , so that the united market will not work against eu citizens he 's right . 
   from the makers of the ` america first , the netherlands second ' video . 
  nice , then i expect an exact copy of that sketch from german tv next week . 
  thank god that never happened . 
  talks should have ended already .
