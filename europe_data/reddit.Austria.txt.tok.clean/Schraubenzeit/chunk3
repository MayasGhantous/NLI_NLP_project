  of course they do , without the americans they would speak german today !, 
  ca n't they just use buses instead ? 
  lets put a garnele on ze grill !, 
  let 's get hammered while we at it . 
  ~ ~ no austria will be next right after they elect hofer . ~ ~ ~ ~ no netherlands will be next right after they elect wilders . ~ ~ no france will be next right after they elect le pen . 
  peace ? 
  not on my watch !, 
  although we are living in relatively peaceful times , we are facing a conflict in ukraine , and terrorism in western europe , could be better imho . 
  poland should leave the eu , that will show them !, 
  * cough *, 
  we already have family bonuses . 
  can you believe this ? 
  in sweden !, 
  sad . 
  ca n't we just import high qualified east-asians , australians , south americans , or canadians , instead of non-qualified hyperreligious people who dislike our culture and values ? 
  well , not even hofers party fp\u00d6 is aiming for an exit now , and he lost the second round 2.124.661 to 2.472.892 - or by 348.231 votes . 
  austria was close , tho . 
  but not as close as before brexit and the trump election . 
  and that prediction is based on what exactly ? 
  but surely , wilders will win the electoral college ? 
  third place is n't exactly winning . 
  quadruple !, 
  ... 16 of 150 seats . 
  seriously , is every british paper in the clickbait business ? 
  nice to see netherlands are still a west european country . 
  a lot . 
  it 's europe . 
   i think it 's going to be in favor of geert wilders with about 70 % what are you ? 
  some kind of liberal socialist ? 
  it will be geert wilders with 120 %, 
  well , i do n't know , so you wo n't need a ballot paper the size of a billboard ? 
  ever heard of `` write in '' , netherlands ? 
  heineken = dutch = nazis , according to history professor recep tayyip e. 
  only the best . 
  sooo . . how is this `` multi-speed eu '' thing going ? 
  ^ or ^ both ? 
  does n't it rain quite often in ireland anyway ? 
  dried dicks ? 
  like . . real penises or much worse , a euphemism for some sort of british delicacy ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_%28disambiguation%29#geography fun fact : in august 2013 , cnn/money and money magazine ranked vienna , va third on its list of the 100 best places to live in the united states . 
  guess it comes with the name . . 
  on the internet !, 
  i prefer bureaucrats over populists . 
  was n't really popular in portugal , was he ? 
  we do n't need a hyperpatriotic cringefest like that . 
  we have akm , which is basically the austrian equivalent of gema . 
  no music video blocking on youtube , tho . 
  well , another reason for a multi-speed eu . 
  former comission-president barroso is from there . 
  why would i wander across a shopping street in the middle of the night ? 
  well , hobos , every city has them . 
  depends on the district . 
  citycenter pretty nice , outskirts ... not so much . 
  austrian vienna , best vienna . 
  * poof * gone . 
  is there no threshold ? 
  wait . . you get into the parliament with 0.7 % of the votes ? 
  but does he have coalition partners ? 
  so ... only high-effort quality memes ? 
  so poland is the new britain ? 
  ca n't wait for new episodes of * doctor kto * and * sherlock dom *, 
  thats like the angriest juice bar ever . 
  well , maybe eat some [ croissants ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croissant#origin_stories ) dear dutchmen . 
  whoever made this forgot the austrian [ bundesadler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_austria ), 
  cultural i guess , germans are n't freaking out when a politican holds a speech . 
  welcome to the club . 
  may i march in ? 
  like the [ * leerschritttaste * ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/leertaste ) we all know from the common * schreibmaschinentastatur * ? 
  what 's with that famous american donald ? 
  you know . . donald faison . 
  most popular donald after donald duck . 
  fun fact : most austrians do n't even know this film even exists . 
  there was a friendship ? 
  france ? 
  rather germany . 
  but not `` across the eu '' . 
  disunity across the eu . 
  everything is fun when you are drunk . 
  yet another reason for a multi-speed eu . 
  now i 'm missing my empire . . 
  brexit and indyref were `` 50/50 '' desicions , tho . 
  about 40 % le pen vs. 60 % macron , or 20 percentage points difference is a whole other story . 
  france follow suit , maybe , but germany ? 
  well , `` auferstanden aus ruinen '' i guess . 
  well , someone is optimistic . 
  multi-speed is n't a new idea , it 's proposed since back when schr\u00f6der was german chancellor . 
  but muh freedom of speech !, 
  well then try '' ( east ) asian '' instead ? 
   i know in the usa it is deemed offensive due to the word being associated with objects . 
  well ... call them `` chinese '' then ? 
  but to be fair , in my country `` oriental '' or in german `` orientalisch '' , is used to describe middle east/arabic , not east asian culture/people . 
  ( also i 'm not chinese ), 
  no he does n't . 
  fake news . 
  sad . 
  so , from what country are you from ? 
   i think we all know what that means ladies and gents . 
  vampires ? 
  oh sweden , why are you so sweet-ish ? 
  strangely nothing in vienna , the protest-capital of europe .
