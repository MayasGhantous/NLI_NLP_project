  they refuse to be german . 
  this is their own fault , but they dont just damage themselves , they create a paralell society within germany which not only destabilizes the regions they live in but also creates civic distrust . 
  this is one thing you must understand , you probably do already but maybe you dont see it as a bad thing . 
  the feeling of community in areas with paralell societies is extremley low , people distrust one another , people dont stick up for one another , everyone feels alianated . 
  this is already bad enaugh in cities but this just reinforces it , i know that because ive grown up in such a region . 
  you might note that i havent been telling anecdotes while you did . 
  this is deliberate . 
  i could also tell you stories about some childhood friends of mine that were muslim . 
  ive grown up in these areas its bound to happen . 
  but then i could also tell you horror stories about muslims beating up my friends or telling me to fuck off because im a native . 
  but thats not the point and i hope i made that clear . 
  im talking about the larger picture . 
  you talk about them inviting you in their homes and you seeing their culture but thats personal things thats things on a very small scale . 
  on a larger scale , this just disconnects the community from itself . 
  maybe you are one of those people that see their own culture as `` bland '' or `` default '' , personally i think growing up amongst people that have a different culture i realize more things about how my own is unique and worth having . 
  and maybe it is because my grandfather himself was a migrant , he assimilated , im a native now . 
  does your turkish friend consider himself a native ? 
  think about that one for a minute . 
  maybe that makes my point clear . 
  not realy saying this is a great way of going on about it but i understand why they do it . 
  good thing im a protestant . 
  good thing the vatican has no influence over the descision making of european countries . 
  good thing modern christianity is either forced to or generally allows ciritcism . 
  good thing modern christianity is too toothless to do anything against criticism anyway . 
  good thing modern christians realize that they can not enforce their cultural ideas upon others . 
  this entire `` but muh christians are bad too '' argument doesnt work and has never worked because christians in overhwelming numbers do not believe that they get to impose their will on everyone else anymore and you can point out the crazies all you want fact is nobody is getting stoned in europe even tho the old testament says so and fact is that in most european countries gays can gay it up without beeing persecuted so spare me the moral nonsense about the supposed sins of christianity . 
  and pardon me the transgrassions against your personal opinions but why on earth are you and people like you still excuse the inhuman treatment of certain groups at the hands of muslims by pointing towards christians ? 
  wouldnt that mean you should be even more critical of religions , not less ? 
  if christianity is as bad as you say it is , which it is not , should you not instead of defending islam by pointing towards freedom of religion maybe debate wehter or not freedom of religion is a good thing in general ? 
  if you are so above this part of human culture ? 
  maybe my other response sheds some light on that . 
  i understand that this is cruel to those people . 
  but i also understand that even the people that are `` rightfully '' here ( and realy i dont know if such people exist ) , they still wont want to adopt our ethics , they wont want to give up their identity . 
  migration is not a question about wrong or right . 
  its a question of who prevails and who is beeing dominated , as cruel as that sounds . 
  there are only two ways this can end . 
  paralell societies which in term leads to poverty , crime and public disorder , or one culture winning and the other culture becoming assimilating ( which means , dont get me wrong here , this culture stopping to existi in this country ) none of these will ever * fully * be attained , but it will be one of those two options . 
  and it is important from both a humanitarian and from an economic standpoint that it 1 . is the second option and 2 . it is ** our ** culture that prevails : even those that come for reasons that arent despicable must be assimilated . 
  and even those that come for reasons that arent despicable probably dont want to do that . 
  this is something i have said numerous times and i think most people dont unterstand what i mean by that but ill try regardless : i would under very specific circumstances do the same as most refugees , but id realize i have no right to do so by other peoples admission . 
  let me explain what i mean by that : if i would have to leave my country , id probably pick the country that is the closest to my home countries culture . 
  so probably id go to swizerland , slovenia , hungary or germany , perhaps the czech republic , tho id prefer to go to swizerland or germany because i actually speak the damn langguage . 
  if that fails , id go to a country that has a language that i speak . 
  which would mean either the uk , ireland or the us , tho id rather not emigrate to the us if i have the chance to avoid moving outside of europe . 
  if that fails , id go to a country that has enaugh speakers of a language i speak that i can get by . 
  that would be the scandinavian countries or the netherlands , in both denmark and the netherlands thre are german speakers and in all those countries they are excellent at speaking english . 
  only if all those options would not be available i would go to a country that does not share a simmilar culture and a simmilar language . 
  and then , only then i would perhaps act like the migrants here do . 
  i would probably also refuse to integrate . 
  if i was moving to afghanistan i would refuse to adopt their sense of ethics very much like most muslim migrants refuse to adopt our sense of ethnics . 
  however , i would realize ** why ** the people of the most county would despise me for this . 
  i would realize that i am not ** right ** to do what i am doing , but i would do it anyway . 
  knowing this , i think i do understand the migrants coming to europe . 
  they dont care about us , they do not want to intgrate . 
  nobody wants to give up his naitonality , his identity . 
  but in order to assimilate you must do that . 
  i would refuse to do that too . 
  this is why i ** know ** that these people must be ** forced ** to do that or leave . 
  look at the non european thinking he knows stuff about christianity in europe . 
  your american stereotypes mean nothing here . 
  yes it is their fault , its their fault they came here to begin with . 
  can we stop treating the refugees as impotent children for once ? 
  they are for the most part grown men , they know what they are doign and they have inflated expectations . 
  showing them that they are unwanted is maybe a way of deincentivizing them coming here in the first place . 
  and yes , its a horrible introduction to the country . 
  thats the point , they want them to leave !, 
  well not realy , for one , the afd doesnt hang anyone . 
  also : just because they dont want refugees doesnt mean they cant help those that are here , the alternative would be them vanishing and with that the possibility of getting rid of them vanishing aswell . 
  yeah thats been a while . 
  one of the few good things we did around that time . 
   i do n't think it 's part of merkel 's plan to allow refugees to choose their country of preference . 
  oh i agree it never was part of the plan . 
  but plans need to be compatible with the reality of the situation . 
  and the reality of the situation right now is : these people have already illegally crossed borders to get to a specifi country and there is for the most part unrestricted movement within most of europe . 
  those two factors together mean that distributing the refugees among countries wont work because no refugee wants to be in any country that isnt germany , sweden or austria . 
   you tend to think in terms of overwhelming majorities and absolutes well , only if that is supported by science . 
  when it comes to the ammount of males around 20 in the refugees then even unchr supports this http://data.unhcr.org/mediterranean/regional.php sorry for not hyperlinkin this but im on a mac right now and macs are stupid . 
  the same is true for the majority of people in the countries of origin having very conservative muslim views . 
  http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-executive-summary/ when it comes to them staying forever : well heres the thing : the war in syria isnt ending anytime soon , syria is far away , their children will grow up here , they will see no reason to return . 
   and i tend to think in relatives and like embracing change and i disagree with the notion that change is always a good thing . 
  this is a narrative that has been pushed by the so called `` progressives '' for a while . 
  `` change is good , you can not resist change '' , nonsense , not all change is good . 
  change is not a one side thing . 
  there is not only `` change forward or stay behind '' , id rather have a change in a different direction . 
  i would like the european nations to rediscover their identities again and unite in diversity to protect themselves from a globalized society that has no regard for human life and human culture . 
  as for muslims integrating : show me one example of muslims integrating into any country . 
  the turks are such a large population group in germany and for what its worth they have not integrated , they do not see themselves as germans they still see themselves as turks , they vote in turkey and they live in turkish areas of the country . 
  and turks are , when it comes to muslims , the most moderate you will ever get . 
  assimilation requires a couple of factors . 
  for one , cultures must be relativeley simmilar . 
  ( see jugoslavs ) and the population needs to be small . 
  but again , keeping the migrants population small by dividing them only works on paper . 
  because they will not stay in the countries where we put them . 
  nobody that lived a middle class life in syria wants to live a lower class life in poland . 
  also please tell me what the benefit would be . 
  and please dont bring the `` they will pay for our elderly '' thing up because i dont buy that one minute , dealing with the refugees now is already more expensive than dealing with the european elderly . 
  they are largley uneducated , they do not speak a european language , they have no qualification to work here . 
  your assumption of them beeing usefull in the past is based on them assimilating , but i see no way of them ever doing that , its not incentivised at all . 
  and yeah , i understand we probably wont be agreeing on this one anytime soon . 
  thanks for keeping a level head i suppose .
