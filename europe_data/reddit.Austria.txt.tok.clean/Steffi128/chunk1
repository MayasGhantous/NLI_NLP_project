would n't be the first time france started a meme war by insulting german bread . 
  the place you go to to exercise is called * fitnessstudio * in german . 
  reddit can . 
  you just have to remember escaping them , by putting a backslash ( \\ \\ ) in front of every bracket that is part of the url and after the last one simply add the closing bracket for the markdown . 
  someone knows the good stuff , then again ... why am i surprised by this ? 
  i can see your flair . 
  after a single sentence , yes . 
  i do n't know , i 've always had an ear for languages . 
  the rockies , grand canyon , yosemite np , yellowstone np , niagara falls , florida keys , death valley , mt. 
  rushmore ( as far as it counts as natural :d ) and some lakes on the border between canada and the us ( e.g. 
  erie ) i think everyone has heard of those and knows at least the continent . 
  twice a year . 
  oh c'mon , sweden ca n't be that bad as a neighbour . 
  definitely the most underestimated fucking creature on this planet . 
  aside from far-right nutters and maybe monarchists ? 
  our current interior minister , wolfgang sobotka is a pretty good candidate for that . 
  he 's saying all kinds of shit all the time , sometimes he even finds literal shit in front of his door and uses that to defend his surveillance plans . 
  same here and apparently my surname is more common in northern germany than it is in austria . 
  yes , i have some extended family members in california . 
  you could 've just explained it with * czechoslovakian stasi * . 
   what 's blue and orange and lies on the ground of the pool ? 
  a baby with popped floaties . 
  shh . 
  [ achberlin_english . txt ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/68ioc8/oh_berlin/ ), 
  same here , the fp\u00d6 is the ~ ~ red ~ ~ blueline . 
  despite everything , germany ... 
  for the last time , everything you see in this * documentaries * is n't real . 
  he 's also writing a new book about the old knickerbocker gang ( now 20 years older ) , he 's given a sneak peek on his facebook page already and is asking for opinions . 
  maybe in the us , but here in austria skunk 's also get to vote !, 
  i grew up in tyrol , neither would we . 
  the coating is the point , you can see a small bit of the breading in the picture . 
  aside from the [ eastern german abomination ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/j\u00e4gerschnitzel#/media/file:jaegerschnitzel.jpg ) , a j\u00e4gerschnitzel is n't coated . 
  schnitzel without coating can ( and shall ) be eaten with sauce , of course , but a schnitzel with breading ? 
  the sauce just destroys the coat , why would anyone want a soggy breading ? 
  this needs a nsfl warning ... 
  i 'll be the one : europe has the best mountains !, 
  norway . 
  the colours are nice , it 's not just three vertical/horizontal bands ( like most ) and it has six other flags hidden ( indonesia , poland , finland , france , the netherlands and thailand ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporal_punishment_in_the_home#laws_by_country it is . 
  yes it does , it 's pickled cabbage after all . 
  i do n't really do this whole favourite thing , but if one would force me to decide i 'd probably also say paris . 
   `` auch '' yes  `` ich '' no the voiceless velar fricative is used for * ch * - sounds after an a , o or u and also after the combined * au * ( like your mentioned * auch * ) . 
  the * ch * in * ich * is a voiceless palatal fricative . 
  obviously , considering scottish english does have the sound as well . 
  most prominently in the word * loch * . 
  that 's the right answer . 
  :d for everyone who does n't know : [ it 's like a hot dog . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosna_\\ ( sausage \\ ) ), 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proporz sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't . 
  like now it does n't really , every few years we hit rock bottom , where the two ( the social democrats and the people 's party ) just ca n't work together anymore . 
  then we get snap elections , with the same outcome ( grand coalition ) , or either one of them tries to form a minority government ( like kreisky ( sp\u00d6 ) did in the 70s ) or one of them invites the far-right fp\u00d6 to form a government ( the sp\u00d6 did it in the 80s ( sinowatz/vranitzky i ) and the \u00d6vp did it in the 90s ( sch\u00fcssel ) ) . 
   air conditioning is n't really a thing in the u.k. 
  neither is it here , never been to a home that has had an ac unit . 
  well , our state broadcaster is also a partner of arte , together with belgium , czech republic , poland , ireland and italy . 
  they act as consultants in artes decision-making and advisory bodies and they do make coproductions and stuff like that . 
   i learned that myself a few weeks ago . 
  italy , especially lignano . 
  yes , answers to those are quite the meme in / r/de . 
  we could trade , a little bit of your coastline for a little bit of our mountains . 
  we had to learn them in primary school . 
   prime minister mark rutte cycles to work a true dutchman . 
   ( is there an english expression ? 
  people who lived through the times and can talk about them ) contemporary witness . 
  \\* lower austria :d, 
  2 years `` ask the uk how it feels ! '', 
  yes , i know . 
  the official stance is british englisch , but with the domination of american english in pop culture the teacher left us the choice , but we had to stick to it ( written and spoken ) . 
  i decided to use british , since it sounds better than american english ( at least in my ears ) . 
  what 's that ? 
  is that something you can eat ? 
  never heard of this * english * thing ... :p, 
  same . 
  * ( workers of the world , unite ! ), 
  i expected the scorpions , was n't disappointed . 
  do n't be sad sweden , you still have spotify and the second best selling video game on the entire planet . 
  well , but in the end he landed in the top 10 . , 
  do n't forget our [ 2012 song contest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkqf8z5uwq8 ) entry . 
  it 's alright . 
  i did too and i got my first mark in first grade , which was an exception back then ( one of the better `` school experiments `` my primary school had signed up for back in 1996 ) . 
  he could also snail mail ( registered mail ! ), 
  the application form with the passport to the czech embassy in ottawa ?!, 
  otherwise i think germany does have a general consulate in vancouver , which is allowed to issue schengen visa , but i do n't know , the diplomatic relations between turkey and germany are a bit rocky these days ... :d, 
  it 's diabetes with a heart attack . 
  well , aside from the `` longing for the german reich part `` those groups are all kinda the same , are n't they ? 
   though , i guess , some people here have this part as well , ours might just long for another german reich * cough * . 
  i personally have n't heard anyone using it , but i could imagine right-wingers are still using it , considering the name was heavily used by the nazis to refer to the non-anschlussed parts . 
  as if the nazi connotation was n't enough reason to use the other name ( again . 
  til : tschechien did exist before ) , like the second paragraph states , we also needed it , due to the split of czechoslovakia ( * tschech * oslowak * ei * ) , because it did n't fit anymore . 
  we got those people too , they 're called * staatsverweigerer * ( country deniers ) here . 
  as is  england for the uk . 
  well , we had a similar thing in the 2000s , `` krocha `` , the style was ridiculous . 
  some of them were as good as trump when it came to using the self-tan , they came out orange . 
  same . 
  well , not surprising , considering the german equivalent of czechia is * tschechien * . 
  the long name 's used for official matters , though . 
  scotland ? 
  well , [ yes . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_austria ), 
  still better than the austrian equivalent * \u00d6sterreich * , they took the worst of both ( the uks tabloids and the german bild ) and made a new * newspaper * out of it . 
  not only in europe , the sausage roll loving police dog is one of austrias better exports .
