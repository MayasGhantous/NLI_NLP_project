  https://bar.wikipedia.org  to your defence : i did n't know there was an austro-bavarian version of wikipedia until recently , when someone posted it on / r/de , either . 
  given that we were neutral during the cold war , we were officially considered central european , albeit our slight bias to the west ( nato ) . 
  well , you already said it , it 's wikipedia in both cases ( austro-bavarian and german ) . 
   andorra having the flag of it as a flair ... hmm ... catalan ? 
  did n't get your 600 $ last week , eh ? 
   the country that borders your country we share borders with : germany , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , italy , switzerland and liechtenstein which one ? 
  france , i guess . 
  i 've seen them in the local media markt in some box at the checkout . 
  i knew what they were because i saw the introduction video on youtube . 
  i ca n't be bothered to buy one , though , pen spinning does keep your hand busy while thinking , as well . 
  yeah , that 's it . 
  like i said , it 's basically what you can do with a pen as well . 
  i guess a pen does n't scream `` look at me !, 
  i 'm ( still young and ) hip ! `` , while this thing apparently does . 
  some weird thingy you can spin with one hand . 
  it has same function as spinning a pen ( cil ) between your fingers . 
  afaik it 's original intention was to be something for ad ( h ) d people to keep them focussed . 
  it 's literally the stalemate , which is leading to endless fights between them , making it even more impossible to get something going . 
  in 2013 the \u00d6vp had managed to get a `` the sp\u00d6 ca n't use their mandate majority to outvote the coalition partner . `` clause in the coalition pact . 
  they should have named it the `` stalemate clause `` , because that 's what that is : something 's in the parliament ( let 's say the liberalisation of trade regulation act , which would be a good thing ) , the \u00d6vp does n't want it to happen and thus the sp\u00d6 ca n't vote for it ( and build a majority with the opposition ) , because they ca n't outvote their partner . 
  it is , but the fp\u00d6 does n't get elected because we want them to actually have power , they get elected solely out frustration with the stalemate government and because we do n't really have another alternative . 
  our political field is small and it 's hard for new one 's to get a place on the ballot . 
  as for the presidential election : if the government parties would 've been able to place two good names on the ballot paper in april 2016 , i think neither vdb nor hofer would 've made it to the run-off , it would 've been sp\u00d6 candidate vs \u00d6vp candidate . 
  one of the main reasons to vote for vdb was n't his political stance , it was to stop hofer ( the right-wing pan-germanic , `` you 'll wonder what else is possible ! `` candidate ) from getting elected . 
  no no , van der bellen stays . 
  he is the head-of-state , he 's our lizzy just not royal , elected and he has a bit more power compared to her . 
  :d national council ( parliament ) elections moved to this october , because the coalition failed three weeks ago . 
  may has ended . 
  i 've seen yesterdays debate . 
  she wants to stay in no . 
  10 and does n't even show up to the debate ? 
  that 's not strong and stable , that 's weak and wobbly . 
  hey , snap election buddy !, 
   filling up the street with tourists who ca n't handle their drugs . 
  especially blocking the bike lanes , am i right ? 
  also bilderbuch ( they even were a music act in jan b\u00f6hmermanns neomagazin a few weeks ago ) . 
  camo & krooked ( dubstep/d 'n' b ) and klangkarussell ( progressive house ) as well . 
  new york , jersey city and yonkers apparently, 
  :p when it comes to genders german < -  romance language just do the opposite of what is the case in your native language . 
  works almost every time . 
  and we 're currently digging the [ brenner base tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brenner_base_tunnel ) . 
  1 = very good 2 = good 3 = satisfying 4 = sufficient 5 = insufficient, 
  the first mandatory foreign language is english . 
  usually it 's mandatory starting in grade five ( secondary school ) . 
  though , some primary schools ( mine did mid 90s ) do have english as a mandatory subject from the beginning . 
  and it stays mandatory until you graduate . 
  in grade nine ( at least in vocational high schools ) you have to choose a second foreign language out of a language pool ( french , italian , spanish , russian ) , most students choose french or italian . 
  i guess that even puts me above the average height for women . 
  the thing with political spectrum tests like this is , they 're all more suited for us politics and our politics are n't really translatable . 
  anyway i got [ social liberalism ] ( https://8values.github.io/results.html?e=62.6&amp;d=71.8&amp;g=69.6&amp;s=86.2 ) which is surprisingly accurate . 
  same here . 
  almost the same here ( i wonder why ... :p ) : * `` braver hund ! `` *, 
  that 's probably what adolf thought as well ... 
  well , the treaties of st. germain and versailles are active since 1918/1919 and 1938 happened anyway ... 
  but you 're right , russia ( back then still the sowjetunion ) used this to block our first application for it , but due to the fall of the curtain and the demise of the ussr in 1989/90 and due to this shift in european politics ( and austria being on the side of the west anyway :p ) they thought `` okay , let 's do it now ! ``, 
  i ca n't believe that we used to be rivals . 
  :d we 're basically in the same cauldron , considering we 'd also keep complaining about how terrible it is in here , but when it comes to getting out , we 'd be like `` nah . 
  it ai n't so bad in here . ``, 
  yep , that would be our pre euro currency . 
  get downvoted for an elaborate comment . 
  reddit never fails to disappoint . 
  while it 's correct , modern western society just does n't compute with that , it wants the week to start with the first day of work and that 's monday ( for most of us anyway ) . 
  that 's probably why iso 8601 declared monday as 1st and sunday as 7th day of the week . 
  then austria took the sausage in a bun and [ upgraded it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosna_\\ ( sausage \\ ) ) . 
  that also counts as an answer to the thread . 
  it is typical street food here , next to the obvious kebabs and stuff . 
  in german we used to call them `` negerkuss `` as well , but austria simply switched to calling every single one of these after the brandname of the most popular one around here , [ schwedenbombe ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwedenbombe ) . 
  yes , it 's the german name for the nordic country with the blue-yellow flag and `` bomb '' , the co-inventor of these thingies was a swede and thus the company decided to give it this name in honours to the guy . 
  ^ ( trivia : m\u00e5ns called himself that after winning the esc in 2015 . :d ), 
  that was n't an earthquake you just felt , it was every italian on the planet collapsing at once !, 
  yes , i 've only seen it , because a substitute english teacher showed us the movie once . 
  the nazi era ( or the prequel to it for that matters ) was n't something you 'd talk about , when the film was released in the 60s . 
  still is n't a topic you 'd talk about now , though , it 's much more acceptable to talk about it . 
  i think it 's also not very popular in germany . 
  sp\u00d6-fp\u00d6 is highly unlikely , yes i know burgenland , but this is federal level , a coalition like that on this level would be their certain death , they know that . 
  what also might save us from the revival of \u00d6vp-fp\u00d6 is that both kurz and strache are onto the chancellors seat and neither one will be satisfied being the others vice . 
  it might just be a grand coalition again , maybe just like it 's now or the other way round ( like germany has it ) , with the \u00d6vp as the senior ( depending on whom we 'll vote for ) . 
  the difference is , that they would be more legitimated afterwards , which in return would also stuff the fp\u00d6 's mps mouths . 
  was n't estonia also the one with the highest availability of fast broadband internet ? 
  15 ^ th october . 
  paris ( does this really need clarification ? 
  it 's paris ! ), 
  london ( i mean it is a fucking expensive city , but i can `` freely choose `` , so i 'm assuming money is n't an issue ) 3 . 
  barcelona ( like the architecture , the climate , it has access to the sea , ... ), 
  i 've never had any imaginary friends . 
  however , i do like the architecture of churches , quite impressive buildings . 
  75,80 $ and it lasts 5 years for children aged 2-11 and 10 years for citizens aged 12 and older . 
  however , there 's also an identity card available ( which is useful for travelling around europe :p ) , lasts 10 years for citizens aged 12 and older and costs 61,50 $ ( for citizens aged 16 and older ) . 
  started a swedish course on duolingo for fun . 
  sounds about right ... , 
  i agree with verka serduchka . 
  a good one is definitely the [ interval act from sweden last year ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amgw54hbos0 ) . 
  that said the austrian `` need to use the arms to push themselves because it 's so flat `` - national team actually is n't that bad . 
  unfortunately the nordics ( aside from the jumping down a hill one :p ) do n't get much love here , due to the focus on alpine skiing . 
  that actually is the real reason why serbia ca n't into eu yet . 
  i 'd be okay with you being in charge of the eus nuclear weapon arsenal . 
  just promise you 'll never grant a crazy person access to them , yeah ? 
  nigel farage would insist on driving on the left and would be the cause of several mass accidents . 
  you can keep driving on the left ( it 's not like you 're only ones in europe that do that ) , but please do complete the metrification .
