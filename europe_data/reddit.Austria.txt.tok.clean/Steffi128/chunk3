  replace driving on the right side with complete metrification . 
  cyprus , ireland and malta do drive on the left side of the road as well , but the uk really should use the metric system . 
  i know it is . 
  or [ commie-nazis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgzmwhhi5fm ) ? 
  oh , shoot , i missed the edit asterisk on his comment . 
  neither are `` cup `` and `` glass `` , are they ? 
  a glass is transparent , cylindric and used for water or cold beverages ( soft drinks or alcoholics ) and a cup is for hot beverages like coffee or tea . 
  propose it to the eu , i mean you 're the major english speaking power inside it , once the britons are out . 
  one does not simply elect the first green head-of-state in europe , but when one does , one does it twice !, 
  wild guess , due to the german and english fluency . 
  i 'm native in german and fluent in english and i can make sense of the written dutch word . 
  we could make it golden . 
  this seriously will be connected to the world cup of '98 forever . 
  even my mind goes `` oh ... france 's world cup song '' whenever i hear that somewhere . 
  ^ ( funfact : '98 was the last one austria has been part of up until today ), 
  i learnt the same as your sister , i presume , [ the 1995 version ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ausgangsschrift#/media/file:schulschrift_1995.jpg ) . 
  just a simplified version of the old one , a lot less paraphed . 
  nine weeks . 
  the country is split in two groups . 
  vienna , lower austria and burgenland start with the beginning of july and a week later others follow . 
  if we were to take hungary in again , we should make sure , that no one of importance visits the balkan states , you know what happened the last time . 
  [ greater germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_question ) you say ? 
  [ this guy ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmtzqcsh6xk ), 
  yes , you could say that . 
  it 's fun , but you 're efficient . 
  there 's no space for fun , in efficiency , am i right ? 
  yeah , complaining is always a good way to enter a conversation . 
  to make you feel better : just think about how it actually is the other way round , the name anglo-saxons has a reason . 
  definitely the overall \\ # 1 . 
  even the basement 's a real beauty !, 
  't was a joke ... , 
  jeez , man , do n't anger them !, 
  france is still voting !, 
  le pen obviously , considering her getting into \u00c9lys\u00e9e would be the certain death of the eu . 
  * how many comments does it need to figure out if a german is from the south or from the north ? 
  * just one about potato salad . 
  you 're a southerner !, 
  i just gave him a hint on how to quickly figure out which countries are part of it . 
  until you zoom in and the whole east coast unfolds . 
  sweden is northern europe , as well as its scandinavian brothers ( denmark , norway , finland ) ... oh and iceland and the faroe islands of course . 
  in a geographical sense turkey ( at least the european part ) is southern eastern . 
  if we 're talking politics , turkey is ... complicated ... it 's uh ... turkey ? 
  ukraine is eastern europe and they were part of the bloc ( obviously ) . 
  geography ( eastern europe ) and politics/history ( eastern bloc ) . 
  look at a map . 
  look were czech republic is . 
  geographically czechia is central europe . 
  to define central europe quickly , best imagine austria and hungary ( le ol' empire :p ) on the map and go up north , until you reach ~ ~ germany 's hat ~ ~ denmark ( that 's where northern europe starts ) , every country you meet until then , is central europe ( plus switzerland and slovenia ) . 
  everything to the east of that is eastern europe ( or not even europe at all , because obviously our continent ends at some point :p ) . 
  eastern bloc means every country that has been ... well ... to the east of the iron curtain during the cold war . 
  hungary, 
  an addition to the commission : the ep also has the power to reject commissioners , if they think ( s ) he is n't fit for the job . 
  which they usually do , 2014 they rejected the first hungarian ( was it ? ), 
  candidate from juncker 's commission . 
  not every country in europe is as liberal as western germany or the netherlands for example . 
  there are countries in europe which are relatively conservative and open for right-wing ( or even extremist ) politics . 
  http://de.euronews.com/2017/04/20/nix-gelernt-43-prozent-der-oesterreicher-fuer-den-starken-mann -- this was submitted to / r/de yesterday , considering it was a poll from sora it obviously is in german . 
  part of the results is , that 23 % austrians wish for a `` f\u00fchrer `` who does n't need to obey to a parliament or stand up for elections , also interesting that 55 % of under 35-year olds ( generation y/millennials ) think that nazism `` was n't all bad `` . 
  and that is despite our massive education on ww2 . 
  this and of course it brought peace and stability to a war-ridden continent . 
  keep it , i 'm quite sure south tyrol has more freedom being with rome than it would 've being with vienna . 
  being part of italy it 's an autonomous region and in austria it certainly would be reunified with tyrol , having to obey to innsbruck ( and of course vienna ) . 
  besides that it does n't really matter any way , considering we 're both eu and the regions are [ working together ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyrol\u2013south_tyrol\u2013trentino_euroregion ) closely . 
  the thing about tyrolians is quite correct , it even starts at children 's age . 
  : / man , kids can be fucking mean , as soon as they knew , that i was born in upper austria ( my mum moved back to tyrol with me when i was six * ish * ... ) i turned into an outsider . 
  like i was some kind of an alien , that was n't worth walking on this turf . 
  huh ? 
  it 's not me you should tell that , i 'm not one of the `` victim complex `` lot . 
  btw : in another comment in [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/66dxd0/which_countries_feel_like_bros_to_you_and_why/dgibpib/ ) i even named germany as a country brother , for that exact reason . 
  we are german-speaking that connects us , we are culturally similar ( some parts more and some parts less , but that 's geography ) that also connects us . 
  well , yeah , at least everyone who paid attention in history classes . 
  :d like i said , it is the stigma on `` being german `` , that made us focus on our austrian identity , rather than acting like germany 's little sibling . 
  even the english wikipedia ( broadly speaking less shit than the german one ) states it in the very first sentence ( germanic ethnic group and nation ) and further in the first sentence of the second ( regarded ethnic germans and viewed themselves as such ) and third paragraph ( discrediting of pan-germanism due to association with nazism [ which is a perfectly logical consequence after the second world war ] ) . 
  i think it 's part of the [ austrian identity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrians ) which we strongly developed after 1945 . 
  you can say thanks to adolf for ruining it , since wwii being german has a certain stigma to it ( but who am i talking to ? 
  you 're confronted with it as well , are n't you ? 
   ) , hence we cut out all the germanic ( read as ethnicity , not as citizen of the federal republic ) in us and said `` we 're austrian , not german ! `` . 
  australia is our upside down name buddy ( mostly to confuse you guys though  ) . 
  latvia is our flag buddy . 
  and well : germany is our language ( and culture as well ) buddy . 
  the reincarnation of the iron lady . 
  do n't be too hard on him , he 's german . 
  resent ? 
  no , i still love our island . 
  i do , however , think that it was a dumb decision , but it was theirs to make . 
  that said , despite what government officials ( on either side of the channel ) say , there is always a way back . 
  you just ca n't predict the future , can you ? 
  i scrolled and scrolled through the comments and i finally found it . 
  making microwave popcorn . 
  the largest migrating group in austria are germans . 
  i do n't have a strong opinion about ( im ) migration , i just do n't care , as long as everyone 's obeying to our laws and stuff it 's all cool . 
  a slight majority 's enough to follow through with a plan , that has such an impact on the whole country . 
  * `` mee-m `` * , like * `` gene `` * , with an * m * . 
  do n't let / r/de hear that . 
  ^ ( i promise , i wo n't tell them , that you called them idiots . ), 
  works the same way here actually , over 25 $ you have to enter your pin code , no matter what . 
  though , theoretically , is it still * really * contactless , if you 're forced to enter your pin , instead of just holding your card up against the terminal , to complete your transaction ? 
  ;d forgetting the pin is easy now , yeah . 
  i 'm always , mixing up two of the digits , i keep thinking `` now , was it * 1234 * or * 1243 * `` ?
