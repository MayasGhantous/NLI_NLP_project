  same in austria , people do love their cash , though , it 's changing slowly , since the major banks started delivering the debit cards with nfc , allowing one to pay up to 25 $ contactless . 
  you should add a nsfl warning to that !, 
  unfortunately , i think you might be right about that . 
  though , both of the may dates are important dates in the history of the eu as well . 
  the fifth commemorates the foundation of the council in 1949 and the ninth commemorates the schuman declaration in 1950 which is the predecessor of today 's thing ( y' know the french and west-german pooling of the coal and steel industries ) . 
  [ like this ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day ), 
  well , if you 'd ask farage he 'd probably say that 23rd june is the ( new ) ~ ~ english ~ ~ british independence day . 
  i know , also denmark 's . 
  well both of the [ `` europe days `` ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/europe_day ) coincide with someone 's liberation from nazigermany . 
  you forgot `` any movie made by and/or starring til schweiger `` . 
  5th or 9th may . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0imgkfd85uu ) edit : oh , and [ dragonball ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s1yupk77pa ) as well . 
  what a time this will be , when the prodigal son finally returns . 
  shots fired !, 
  even some news papers and broadcasters ( well with their respective online portals anyway ) are on board , to fool the audience on this special day . 
  well , yes , if anyone from europe wins , it 's cool , is n't it ? 
  :d that said , cheering for one nation does n't matter to me , i want to see good football game , or a good ski race or whatever 's on in the first place . 
  the german-speaking countries do have the tradition as well . 
   there 's a reason why the word ` dutch ' sounds strikingly similar to ` deutsch ' well ... ** d ** ~ ~ e ~ ~ ** ut ** ~ ~ s ~ ~ ** ch **, 
  flemish actually are included as well , they 're included in * fiamminghi * in the name ; just like you 're . 
  belgian french are ... well ... french . 
  considering it is connected to the state treaty of 1955 and that this document gave us our sovereignty back it 's not that stupid a reason , is it ? 
  ;p some parts of our neutrality got updated anyway since we joined the eu and are obligated to help our buddies ; in peace-keeping missions anyway ( we are even part of the nato partnership for peace ) . 
  it 's just a prank , bro !, 
  / r/austria uses both , but mostly the english terms . 
  / r/aeiou is austria 's circlejerk sub ... well , everything 's austrian-german in there . 
  / r/de uses translated terms , but someone already mentioned that . 
   edit = `` edith '' ( it 's a first name ) that 's used in german as well , though i have n't seen it as much on reddit as i used to see it on forums in the early 2000s ; back then some also used to write `` tante edith sagt : < editierung  `` ( aunt edith says : < edited text  ), 
  and of course hugh grant 's hilarious dance scene !, 
  english can be weird . 
  it can be understood through tough thorough thought , though . 
  other than that , nothing really . 
  youtube 's comment section attracts the dregs of our society , they attack everyone who is n't on their side . 
  you 'll be fine . 
  2006 still hurts you , eh ? 
  :p american pop culture is ( thanks to the internet ) prevalent , speaking about american pop culture , sports or politics does n't make one american , though . 
  also he 's an american expat , of course he 'd think that , people tend seek for the stuff they already know . 
  do n't worry they wo n't kill you for using english in the subreddit . 
   however , they 'll grill you , if you use google to translate english into dutch and post ( rule 7 ) . 
  at least he 's staying out of politics , so that 's ... uh ... good . 
  and not australia . 
  new zealand or canada, 
  the blue one with 12 golden stars , whose flag is it again ? 
  other than that : every flag that is n't just two or three stripes ( vertical or horizontal ) , like the czech flag or the union flag . 
  same here . 
  left : hot , right : cold . 
  * what have the romans ever done for us ? 
  the first one 's about a guy who apparently never has been to a pool and is asking a bunch of ridiculous questions , like for example if there are airport like security controls at the entrance . 
  in the second one , somebody 's complaining that someone left some of his digestive system 's end products in the kitchen of his student 's accommodation . 
  and in the third someone 's sharing that someone stole his bike , which he 'd left ( locked up of course ) in front of the main station . 
  the only good part for him was , though , that his bike apparently did n't have functional brakes . 
  that 's because the cancer usually comes with the mainstream . 
  once the user base hits the higher marks it becomes quite the task to maintain a healthy community , but we 're doing a good job so far at almost 13k . 
  more or less . 
  that . 
   also said , that probably everyone can say that , about every country . 
  this is where the other comment fits in , it 's a matter of getting used to , if you know it , it 's perfectly normal , you just have to give a chance and be open about it , which i was , and you can discover something new . 
  four awesome countries , brought together in a union . 
  ^ ( this always reminds me of something else , but i never can remember what it is . 
  :d ) good music , good tv shows , movies and documentaries ( david attenborough ! ) . 
  it even has good food , though there 's some weird stuff going on in your kitchen . 
  i do n't know ... table tennis ? 
  i agree , should 've worded this differently , to include the 90s in it as well . 
   the range of birth years is not really ours define though , like said in the nested comments , some demographers also include the late 70s in this generation , but do stop in the early to mid 90s . 
  i guess loads of people are in a similar situation , they just do n't rant about it publicly . 
  securing the eu citizens rights in the uk ( and vice-versa for that matters ) might just be toughest part about the negotiations . 
   since in the end it was all about freedom of movement ( whose fault is that , eh ? 
  ) ; if you 're going to keep freedom of movement you could just stay in the bloc . 
  i follow the uks politics for various reasons . 
  that whole thing feels like a game of chicken right now ; brinkmanship at its finest on the future of the country . 
  whoever chickens out first gets ripped several new arseholes by everyone for blocking the will of the people !!!!, 
  well , if it does happen in the hardest possible way ( aka the tory way right now ) , you both could always move to ireland and start your new life over there , i heard ireland was beautiful too . 
  yeah , we 're a pretty broad generation , though the definition of the date and age range differs a lot , apparently . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/millennials#date_and_age_range_defining but almost everyone sets the range to about 20 years . 
  millennials are those born between 1980 and 1999 , those who spend most of their adolescence after ... well ... the millennium . 
  people who currently are between 18 and 35 , is more likely to be heard in the german-speaking ( i deduce that from your nickname :p ) countries . 
  also the audience of reddit . 
  well ... uhh ... none . 
  been there , done that and got our arse handed to us . 
  twice . 
  same here , never met a portuguese outside of portugal , but if they 're abroad just like they 're in portugal i assume they 're cool . 
  yes , indeed . 
  i guess we 'll also see that later this year , when you get to elect a new parliament . 
   no , i would n't , if the voting decision is the only issue with the guy . 
  i mean not every citizen who votes for these parties is a right-wing ( - extremist ) , a good part of the electorate do vote for them , because they feel they do n't have another choice ; frustration voting . 
  i 'd have to `` break up `` with a good chunk of my family as well , if i did that . 
  besides , sometimes it is the source of a good discussion , is n't it ? 
   i 'm just saying i could n't vote for them , because of what i wrote above . 
  no , i do n't . 
  ^ ( aside from being a woman , these parties do n't really stand for what i stand for ... :p ) sadly enough , the freedom party is strong enough already and they 're literally a bunch of nazis , considering the party evolved from the post wwii party `` verband der unabh\u00e4ngigen '' ( union of the independent ) , which again was a union of two former groups that were fond of the greater german solution ( to put it nicely :p ) . 
  also today the party has more than a few active members that were sentenced ( both , legally and non-legally binding ) for re-engagement in ns activities , demagoguery , ... in the past . 
  fermented milk drink from russia . 
  water . 
  sounds delicious ... well ... there 's cheese involved . 
  everything that has cheese is delicious !, 
  it 's okay , you do n't have to . 
  we know it anyway . 
  yeah , you better make yourself a freshly brewed cup of coffee using some of that styrian water from the tap .
