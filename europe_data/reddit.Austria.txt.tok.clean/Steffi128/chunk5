  after three years of using it !, 
  by looking at my hand , that 's my cat 's favourite game as well ... 
   you 're just like yours ? 
  apart from english lessons since year 1 , i learnt most of it by watching english tv shows and movies , reading english books and also the internet ( tho ' that 's barely textbook english :p ) . 
  i think he 's talking about the 2000-2006 `` incident `` , where we ( well , not me actually , considering i was just about 10 years old back then ) broke out of our `` eternal grand coalition `` and briefly had a coalition government containing the christian-democrats ( \u00d6vp ) and the freedom party ( fp\u00d6 ) . 
  j\u00f6rg haider was the chairman of the freedom party back then . 
  the eu did n't try to stop a democratic outcome though , they ostracised the austrian government and kept the social-interactions to a bare minimum , due to the fear that the right-wing extremist attitude of ( some of ) the freedom parties ministers could influence politics ( in austria and to further extend also elsewhere in the eu ) . 
  they lifted these restrictions after almost a year . 
  kaiserschmarrn , for both . 
  -- if you insist on two different things , then it 's wiener schnitzel as the warm non-dessert dish and sachertorte as the dessert !, 
  [ apparently . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/meatball#meatballs_across_various_cultures )  in sweden , k\u00f6ttbullar [ \u02c8\u0255\u0153t\u02d0b\u0275lar ] [ ... ], 
  maybe ikea in d.c. has run out of k\u00f6ttbullar ... 
  / r/the _ schulz is leaking . 
  imessage and whatsapp/telegram . 
  tunnel = boring . 
  it comes with lingonberry jam and a slice of lemon , which you can squeeze over it , to give it a nice taste . 
   on the side we have lettuce , cucumber or potato salad ; the latter warm and without mayonnaise and ( depending on your choice of salad ) either potatoes ( parsley , roasted or fries ) or rice . 
  if the dish is done right , there 's nothing dry about it , you do n't need sauce to force it down your throat . 
   1 ) what timezone are you in , where is it relative to gmt ? 
  ( gmt + / - ?? ), 
  gmt +1  2 ) where are you from , and how much exposure do you get to different european cultures ? 
  quite a lot i guess , due to me travelling a lot . 
  lived in germany and the uk ( england and wales to be precise ) , currently back in austria , though . 
   3 ) what language ( s ) do you speak ? 
  german , english , horrible french and italian ( should brush that up again ) also know latin ( but let 's not talk about that , right ? 
   )  4 ) do you moderate any other subreddits ? 
   5 ) have you been banned from here or any other subreddit before , and if so , why ? 
  well , only from one of those european t_d equivalents , the austrian one after the presidential election . 
  i was answering someone in the exact same way he posted , just with the opposite meaning and the salty bastards did n't like that . 
   6 ) how active are you on this sub ? 
  pretty active , i guess . 
   7 ) do you have any interesting ideas about how to do outreach both on and outside of this sub ? 
  perhaps some neat ideas for competitions , weekly threads or anything else ? 
  feel free to pm me the answer to this question if you 'd like to keep this answer unique to yourself . 
  i 'll send that in the mail . 
  ;d  8 ) anything else you 'd like to add ? 
  building bridges !, 
  a user insults you directly without realising you 're a mod , as part of a comment reply . 
  what , if anything , would you do ? 
  depends on the context . 
  did i call for that insult , because of what i said previously or is the user just being a dick ? 
  if the latter i 'd probably discuss that as a user , not as a mod . 
  a submission has been heavily downvoted and has received a significant number of reports for containing controversial political opinions . 
  what , if anything , would you do ? 
  i 'd look at the submission , if it 's derogatory ( meaning against site or sub rules ) i 'd delete it otherwise i 'd let it be . 
   c . a user has post history on other subreddits would break rules on here ( eg frequently says extremely rascist things ) but is careful to not break the rules on this sub , instead using coded language . 
  how would you handle them ? 
  if he 's showing an extremist attitude in this sub , does n't matter if he uses coded language or not , i 'd probably ban him ( temporarily or permanent ; depends on the case ) . 
  ostrich , second meaning : `` a person who refuses to face reality or accept facts `` `` refuses to accept facts `` ... hmm ... yeah sounds about right for about 30 % of the population . 
  j\u00e4gerschnitzel ( the real one , not the one the former gdr federal states mean ! ), 
  is n't coated , though , is it ? 
   we 're having this discussion in / r/de on a monthly basis , the point is : coated ( commonly known as `` wiener schnitzel `` ) and sauce = no-no . 
  uncoated ( `` natural `` ) and sauce = do what you want . 
  well , maybe because pork 's cheaper than veal ... 
  original \u201e wiener schnitzel `` are made from veal , though , every other piece of meat in a breadcrumb coat shall be named \u201e schnitzel nach wiener art `` ( schnitzel viennese-style ) . 
  well , at least that does n't take away all the work you 've done previously . 
  why would you coat a piece of veal in breadcrumbs and bake it only to have the breadcrumb coat destroyed by sauce afterwards ? 
   what food from your country area is sometimes `` raped '' in other parts of the world ? 
  wiener schnitzel with sauce on top of it . 
  * looking at you , germany !, 
  the first one sounds like `` wer hat angst vor 'm wei\u00dfen hai ? `` ( who 's afraid of the white shark ? ), 
  [ which is the politically correct version of `` wer hat angst vor 'm schwarzen mann ? `` ( who 's afraid of the black guy ? ) ], 
  in german . 
  :d except in our version there 's a little dialogue involved . 
  the shark ( s ) : `` wer hat angst vor 'm wei\u00dfen hai ? `` the crowd : `` niemand ! `` ( nobody ) the shark ( s ) : `` und wenn er kommt ? `` ( and when he comes ? ), 
  the crowd : `` dann laufen wir davon ! `` ( then we 'll run away ! ), 
  then the crowd tries to get to the other side of the field , while the shark tries to catch as many as he can and every person he touches becomes a shark as well . 
  the last person standing wins the game and has the honour to be first shark in the next game . 
  at least as long as you serve him his martini shaken , not stirred !, 
  and now place these countries on a map !, 
  yep , we did that in primary school as well . 
  we already have the best languages . 
  including the proper version of english . 
  the best and the greatest people . 
  everyone knows so . 
  even the potus knows . 
  his current wife is slovenian . 
  it 's true . 
  absolutely true . 
  maybe for some kind of union of all the countries on this continent ( including our beloved islands of course ) of ... what 's its name again ... europe ? 
  it 's okay . 
  well , if you need any help , say a word . 
  do you also feel so left out right now ( just like me ) ? 
  found the reporter / u/wurzn was talking about ... :d, 
  we learnt both . 
  we got to choose between british and american english , but we had to stick to it , we could n't mix them up or switch . 
  while most of my peers went with american english , i chose british , because i was used to it already ; mostly due to british friends and also the bbc . 
  apart from the obvious disney stuff * pok\u00e9mon * digimon * dragonball * pingu * heidi * vicky the viking * tom and jerry * dangermouse * blinky bill * teenage mutant ninja turtles educational : * die sendung mit der maus ( the show with the mouse ) * l\u00f6wenzahn ( dandelion ) * once upon a time ... 
  yes , jacket potatoes are a thing around here . 
  agreed . 
  and telegram is based in berlin . 
   sigur r\u00f3s - s\u00e6gl\u00f3pur - icelandic ( at least i think this one is because it somewhat translates ; some are in gibberish ! ), 
  i knew someone would post it . 
  thanks you saved me a trip to youtube . 
  :d there 's something about icelandic music . 
  maybe he got caught stealing a german car in germany and thus is a little ticked off with them . 
  not australia . 
  lol . 
  clicked on it , and it randomly gave me * brandenburg cragglethatch * .
