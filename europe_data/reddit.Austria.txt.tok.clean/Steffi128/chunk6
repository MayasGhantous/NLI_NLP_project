  a ( n eastern - ) german is behind that , definitely !, 
  like wimbledon tennismatch . 
  yeah , same here . 
  i 'd never swear in front of my parents , that just feels weird ... 
  even when i just stubbed my freakin ' toe . 
  i 'd resist swearing if they can hear me . 
  your old latin teacher is my old german teacher . 
  `` ( republik ) mazedonien `` in everyday 's language , the german translation for the fyrom is `` ehemalige jugoslawische republik mazedonien ( ejrm ) `` . 
  yes , i can , then again i 've always had an ear for languages . 
  we solved the mystery of the english language once and for all . 
  it is definitely of british origin ( suck it america ) !, 
  that it outlives 2017 . 
   austria well we wrote eurovision history with that . 
  we were the first host who did n't receive a single fucking point . 
  it was n't an overall killer song , i grant you that europe , but it so did n't deserve that ( the same goes for germany ) . 
  english can be weird though , but it can be understood through tough thorough thought . 
  if you need help , just head over to / r/german we 're happy to help !, 
  yeah . 
  it 's like they took german and removed the hard bits ... :d, 
  it 's number one then , i mean look at his hair ... 
  i 'm surprised that i had to scroll down this far to find that !, 
  german . 
  most of all , because the teacher was tremendously boring . 
  english and physics . 
  i 've always liked greece 's and ireland 's . 
  i 'm pretty satisfied with [ our ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/at.en.html ) coin motives . 
  the united kingdom , master of sarcasm and home to the language almost everyone commands . 
  that seems familiar ... and i 'm not even british !, 
  austria could use one too , considering it took us almost a year to elect a new head of state , not to mention , that we were about to elect a far-right person as head of state . 
  of course you 're european . 
  like it or not ( looking at you uk ) . 
  that sums it up perfectly . 
  ... with their [ swastika clothes racks ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fe2ak9l.jpg ) . 
  found the drunk . 
  same over here . 
  people do know that the german word is * vereinigtes k\u00f6nigreich ( von gro\u00dfbritannien und nordirland ) * , yet they decide to use england synonymously for the whole thing . 
  i find it a tad annoying and i feel obligated to correct the fuck out of those people , also when they -- like you said -- misuse * gro\u00dfbritannien * by including northern ireland in it . 
  i had a quick encounter with spanish in secondary i , but yeah . . how much can you learn in a year ? 
  * german ( native ) * english ( year 1 to 13 ) * italian ( year 9 to 13 ) * french ( year 9 to 13 ) i also had latin , but you know ... it 's not spoken anymore . 
   ime it 's not a very hot topic in austria , anymore . 
  aside from right-wing populistic ~ ~ shitlords ~ ~ politicians trying to centre the electorate around them using the emotion of a `` reunited tyrol `` . 
  you know who i 'm talking about !, 
   yet here germany , have a snickers , you look like you 're hungry . 
  for us too , we even had to stand up whenever another teacher ( or the headmaster ) entered the classroom , though most of them simply told us to `` stay seated `` while entering the room . 
  well ... 
  i doubt you 'll have a eu election again , considering the next one 's in 2019 ... 
   cross language barriers  austria oh , c'mon ... the language barrier between austria and germany is n't that high . 
  is / r/the _ schulz leaking ? 
  yep , definitely the ipad for me too . 
  is available in austria too . 
  did n't mcdonalds germany sell burgers with nurnberger sausages ( at least for a limited amount of time ) ? 
  yes it is , with some limitations . 
  also prices and additional stuff are dependent on your federal state 's insurance company . 
  in general included is : * emergency treatment * check ups ( twice a year is the usual ) * fillings * root canals * tartar removal * braces & dentures * surgery as for fillings : the alloy is always free of charge , composite resin ( white ) is not . 
  white 's are at about 90 to 150 $ ( depending on how much material the dentist needs ) . 
  as for braces : they 're only included for kids if unavoidable . 
   despite brexit * and snooper 's charter * . 
  ftfy . 
   ... or it will end like in austria : / do you know more than we do ? 
  it 's okay , we probably earned it ... : /, 
   and battle the austrians thank you . 
  my favourite 's [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bylj_hzpv-8 ) . 
  :d the [ austrian one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qytnc8zxu8 ) is part of the second category , i guess austria has had enough of militant marches ( wonder why ... :p ), 
  the french anthem always makes me want to go into battle , albeit not even being french . 
   which i love pointing out to americans . 
  i guess we 're in the same boat here ... just replace americans with germans ...  though we do n't use the tune anymore ( because wwii happened ) the german anthem tune has long been ours . 
  well , most long distance bus lines do n't even have cross border lines , actually the only i can think of right now , that does , is flixbus ; operating from germany and connecting germany with the neighbouring countries . 
  long distance bus lines across europe ( a system comparable to grey hounds ) are a pretty new thing , because we 're pretty proud of our railway network and we focused on connecting us via railway . 
  that said , i 'd suggest looking into interrail/eurail passes , they 're pretty great . 
  it 's a cooperation between the european railway companies ; the price depends on your age ( over or under 26 ) , the amount of days you plan on using it and the number of countries you want to visit . 
  the one with the rearranged german flag shall shut up now . 
  france is n't the only european country , in which they 're trying to interfere with their alt-right memes . 
  * / r/the _ frauke -- germany * / r/the _ hofer -- austria * / r/the _ farage -- uk * / r/the _ wilders -- netherlands and those are just the ones i just found , i 'm sure there 'll be others . 
  they surely do n't even know a fucking thing about our countries ( austria is that continent down under , which shares the head of state with the uk , am i right ? ), 
  you might want to rethink this , we still do have an election coming up ... 
  nothing like you have , vocational high schools do have mandatory internships , but those are limited to four weeks during the summer either between year 11 and 12 or between year 12 and 13 . 
  i see chefkoch and instantly think `` i bet there 's cream in it ! '', 
  yeah , that 's black magic . 
  well , i 've seen it , but only because i wanted to know what we get associated with ... you can ask austrians most of them wo n't even have heard of it . 
  and americans just keep referring to it on tv shows , it 's kinda funny ... 
  i 'm like `` oh ... and here it is , the obligatory sound of music reference ! '', 
  and yet they keep confusing us with those upside down mates the uk has ... :| it 's either * sound of music * or * put another shrimp on the barbie * ... 
   he has an enormous appetite for the ladies and prequently hosts sex parties with prostitutes . 
  also underaged one 's ... * cough *, 
  without clicking it : * love love peace peace ... * :d, 
  brexit will be quite simple ... * 20 years later ... *, 
  yep it did get cheaper . 
  3 years ago , i paid about 1100 $ -- including the things you need to do during your `` novice driver status '' ... you know the * drivers safety training * and those two check up lesson thingies ... 
  the marmite shortage ? 
  i second that . 
  native : german fluent : english mediocre : italian meh : french i also had latin in school , but that 's dead . 
   worse german - i can order a beer well , you do n't need more knowledge than that . 
  you passed the test , here 's your citizenship !, 
  you beat me to it ... ;d, 
  the austrian head of state , is elected for a six year term and is limited to two consecutive terms . 
  he is mostly a figure head , though he does have a few things he can do : * he co-signs new laws or can veto them , if they 're against our constitution . 
  actually our former president did veto a bill once . 
  * he appoints and swears in the new chancellor and his cabinet after a general election ( or any other changes ) . 
  * he is commander in chief of the austrian armed forces . 
  * he can dissolve the national council ( on advice of the federal government ) , but he needs a very good reason to do so -- otherwise it would be a breach of constitution .
