let 's see : openwrt , manjaro linux , windows 7 , windows server 2012 r2 , sometimes various stuff on my raspberrypi , android . 
  on remote servers ( which i do n't always have control of choosing the os ) : debian stable , amazon 's idea of rhel on the rest i usually do n't dig deep enough to care about the os . 
  in austria it is about 1000 usd per semester in fees for non eu students . 
  i am not sure if that is expensive compared to where you 're from . 
  new mexico does not use the peso ?!, 
  wtf ? 
  when i visited the european parliament in brussels , i really liked the ideas presented in their museum etc. 
  but looking at the reality it seems like they are the people that nag and complain a bit while not really being able to change things . 
  take for example the resolution to stop the `` safe harbour '' agreement with the usa , where in the end nothing happened . 
  when i read about that resolution , i was really happy - but then i found out it would be nothing more than a `` strongly worded letter '' to the commission in the end . 
  already this commission has started with the german guy proposing a blanket internet tax because `` the internet '' contains copyrighted material ( and i doubt that this would mean we are allowed to share copyrighted material freely in the eu between each other as long as we pay the tax ) for example . 
  another point are negotiations that are kept as secret as possible for as long as possible to `` not upset '' citizens . 
  so my questions are : 1 . 
  should the european parliament have more power over international agreements ( e.g. 
  to make the decision to cancel that `` safe harbour '' agreement instead of just demanding that it should be cancelled ) ? 
  would this even be a good thing or would this lead to more chaos ( everybody wants to cancel this and that all the time and no work gets done ) ? 
  would a very extreme `` no secrets '' transparency policy be feasible/possible ? 
  i doubt that it would be possible to ignore the eu in negotiations just because their new policy would be to always negotiate in the open right from the beginning ... 3 . 
  very often we only hear about the failures of the eu institutions . 
  what are 3 success stories you are proud to tell us about that happened this year and that might have been underreported ? 
  let 's hope mr. stadler just stays there and never returns ... 
  well , then tell us exactly for _ each _ picture which one is which . 
  ca n't tell the difference in some cases ? 
  maybe think a bit about that ... 
  [ eav - leckt 's mi do am oasch ( german , viennese dialect ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbljx1p9i3a ), 
  ah , the modern wonder of pencils . 
  time to trade a few glass beads and lighters with the native people of estonia for furs and berries . 
  also seems quite close to the german `` blei '' . 
  what 's '' : / '' about that point of view ? 
  everybody should be able to do with their own body as they please as long as it does n't harm others . 
  thanks a lot !, 
  not so sure , i guess there would be some hotspots ( especially in larger cities ) . 
  i 'm genuinely interested , this is not some `` murica '' - bashing ... 
  well , we have compulsory military service , so i 'm not sure if the experiences there are comparable to the military of a country that is actively engaged in wars for decades already . 
  compared to e.g. 
  jarhead the treatment was seriously better , then again we were being deployed to `` secure '' the hungarian border for 6 weeks , not to go to irak/kuwait ( wherever that movie took place , it 's been some time since i 've watched it ) for months . 
  there are always horror stories about idiots who think they must act out their frustrations on the recruits , but just like with teachers there are some really great ones , some really bad ones and most of them are inbetween . 
  edit : there 's this saying `` bundesheer ist wie schnittlauch - au\u00dfen gr\u00fcn , innen hohl '' ( the military is like chives - green on the outside , hollow on the inside [ hollow in the sense of having a hollow head/being stupid ] ) since uniforms are green ... in some cases there 's more truth to it than you might think . 
  i 'd love to see the us compared to that . 
  great way to explain people the ice age - this is a `` u '' shaped valley , formed by a glacier . 
  according to a post here ~ 4.88 $ / m \u00b3 including the waste water fees , half if you 're not connected to the public sewers . 
  a reasonable price imho , if there was n't a separate tax for subsidizing it already existing . 
  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/sekt#sektmarkt_in_deutschland not sure what to recommend though , depends on your taste after all . 
  well , since the bottle of sparkling wine that is used for the christenings of the ships is now more expensive , they put the whole project on hold and are currently re-evaluating options ... 
  well , austria reintroduced the sparkling wine tax this year ... ;-), 
  austria might be peace loving , they are definitely not ( yugo ) slav-loving . 
  this has lead to a large amount of second generation kinds ( who are now in about the age range as these fine young ladies ) who have traumatized parents , live in a society that does n't really like them anyways but also have nowhere else to go . 
  usually in such a situation you either fulfill your parent 's dreams ( or nightmares , depending on what kind of kid you are ) , or you are looking for other moral codes and norms to hold onto . 
  compared to christianity ( especially in austria ) , islam offers a more concise , simpler to follow set of rules . 
  it is hard as a woman to `` matter '' in the catholic church , also these kids are usually muslim to begin with and people anyways rarely change their religion other than moving away from it alltogether . 
  i doubt the quran has much to do with this , if roles were reversed , you could send children on crusades without problems in the middle ages using the bible ... 
  just like with any currency , if that competitor gets more popular that is a valid concern . 
  the problem is that there are already hundreds of them out there and none have yet gained any serious traction . 
  if your private money made of sea shells gets more popular than the euro , good for you !, 
  it 's just not likely to happen ... 
  you usually pay double if you 're not from the eu , universities of applied sciences ( `` fachhochschulen '' ) can charge whatever they want ... http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/studiengeb%c3%bchr#.c3.96sterreich it 's ( slightly ) complicated . 
  from when are these numbers ? 
  it 's not true for austria for example . 
  maybe average population density is not the best measure for this ... is there data about median population density ( 50 % of people live in an area less dense and 50 % live in more densely populated areas ) ? 
  that might work better ... 
  have a cookie !, 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21_zv_ihtje, 
  can someone please multiply the average cost for beer in each country with these numbers to see how much an average person in each country spends on beer per year ? 
  what you seem to be missing is my critizism of only reporting relative growth , not absolute . 
  especially after taking a loss relative numbers do n't really make that much sense . 
  well , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_uprising comes to mind - and germany apparently opted for the `` destroy '' option . 
  reality check for all the `` percentage preachers '' : if something looses 50 % and then gains 70 % , is there still something missing and if yes , how much ? 
  calculated with 100 of something : [ spoiler ] ( / s `` 100-50 % = 50 . 
  this means there is still a total loss of 15 % . 
  in other words , there _ still _ needs to be growth of about 18 % . '' ), 
  demonic gargling sounds . 
  weird , i just looked at renfe.com and found tickets from ~ 27 $ ( as far as my spanish goes , a limited offer ) up to the probably normal price of ~ 70 $ . 
  i would guess that most people around here take the train for shorter distances than 4 + hours though . 
  got some numbers ? 
  in austria for example a one way ticket graz --  vienna costs 37.50 $ ( 2.5 hours , about 200 km ) , half if you have a 99 $ reduction card which is valid for a year . 
  austria : anything related to skiing , check out pictures for `` schladming 2013 '' for example . 
  it is very well known + popular in austria though . 
  the smaller events are often extreme sport events sponsored by red bull ( e.g. 
  http://redbulldolomitenmann.com - running up a hill , paragliding down twice , biking up + down again and kayaking including a final 800m sprint on solid ground with the boat in the end or http://www.erzbergrodeo.at/ - how far up a crumbly , steep hill can you get ? 
  it is a surprisingly difficult problem to estimate crowd sizes . 
  nowadays the most accurate data could potentially come from mobile phone carriers ...

  yeah , 10 cents pretty soon . 
  also sausage sandwiches ( sorry , `` wurstsemmel '' is hard to translate - just google it ) went from ~ 10 ats to ~ 1 eur ( 13.76 ats ) . 
  these kind of stores often go bankrupt ( at least the one in my town did ) , as they rely heavily on siphoning off excess pocket money from kids . 
  you can find something like that ( bulk stuff sold overpriced by weight ) often in shopping malls or at fairs . 
  in austria sweets started at 1 ats ( 0.072 eur ) anyways , so getting something for 5 cents was still a bargain . 
  maybe for new reactors - that does n't mean that the old ones are not getting more and more problematic . 
  the initial investment for nuclear is so high ( i can buy a pv solar panel in the supermarket ! ), 
  that even with more secure techniques it still will encourage saving as much as possible ( if i pay 3 % more for a more secure pv panel , i do n't care - if a nuclear plant costs 3 % more , that 's a lot of money ! ), 
  and making compromises . 
  they could start insulating their homes , then they would n't need to burn so much electricity in the first place !, 
  as much as i dislike vienna from time to time , public transport there is cheap ( 1 $ / day !, 
  ) , efficient and better than nearly everywhere else i 've been . 
  every german trying to move/visit here should watch http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103510/ first . 
  while grammar is similar , they do n't really understand each other . 
  probably not as far apart as hindi and german ( indogermanic is a thing ! ), 
  but far enough not to really be able to communicate . 
  estonian is really close to finnish by the way ... 
  city and culture wise , mostly the eastern neighbours ( slovenia , slovakia , hungary , czech republic ) , language wise of course germany/bavaria , from the landscape probably switzerland or northern italy .
