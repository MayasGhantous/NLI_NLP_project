  right next to germany ... 
  austria did so for decades with the hungarian border . 
  did n't even need a fence . 
  nope , since we take far more than you per capita . 
  we already owned you once , did n't exactly go well ... 
  yeah , i 'm just glad you did n't try to go 200 + on austrian highways ... 
  the alps are in austria ... 
  my guess is it will pass more easily , since people likely are scared by foreigners crossing the country towards austria and germany . 
  suddenly stuff that does n't please muslims gets more popular , just like people voting for conchita wurst to piss off homophobic/transphobic russians . 
  would be enough for any american to go crazy because of the clearly irish ancestry on st. patrick 's day . 
  called frankfurter in austria and viennese sausages in germany . 
  it 's like nobody wants to claim responsibility !, 
  at least if you have white skin ... 
  not like you guys have a larger alphabet than the usa or anything ... 
  somewhere for sure , but definitely not in every supermarket . 
  austrians simply do n't know the movie - it was never popular here and by now it is already quite old . 
  the ones that know it often just see it as a random musical taking place in austria , not as the life changing experience that makes you want to cross the big ocean to search of the magic wonderland that austria must be ... 
  i wanted to do one of these tours for fun , but they are far too expensive if you 're not into that stuff or if it 's a once in a lifetime visit to europe . 
  what ?!, 
  i 'm sorry that apparently some of my fellow austrians dared to denounce the nectar of the gods that is kofola !, 
  then again , more left for me ... 
   why are there no pictures of him and the 24 refugees he was allegedly hosting ? 
  because it would be illegal under german law to publish pictures of people that do n't want them published . 
  also he seems to have gotten death threats ( by germans by the way ) . 
  their facebook profiles are linked in the source by the way , if you 're after pictures ...  what if another guy wrote a post about how he hosted one refugee , who stole all his valuable stuff , raped his girlfriend and ate his dog for dinner , would anyone take him serious without police reports , pictures , witnesses ? 
  beacuse this would be accusing someone of having commited a crime or felony , which in itself can lead to serious consequences if the accusation is knowingly wrong . 
  killed himself after killing a few million of his fellow countrymen in an idiotic war . 
  ... kchchcch . 
  it was made by an austrian ... 
  \\ # 1 is in the top 10 too ... 
  in other words : we win !, 
  yes , but instead of some random flag they would see ours every day when having to fight for food . 
  worked out great for the us , when they gave `` aid '' to the taliban and then left them as soon as they could ... do you really think we 'd keep funding and staffing refugee camps in the middle east for decades just because one time in 2015 a few thousand made it through to here ? 
  there are people without adblock on the internet ? 
  settling in austria is n't much thought of ?!, 
  there are record numbers of people asking for asylum here ... if this kind of stuff is all you read , maybe consider to check out some media articles a bit further out of your filter bubble . 
  if you want to do interviews , i guess you 'll have to wait until people get settled or get on the ground yourself , grab an interpreter that is n't currently busy with translating medical issues and start interviewing . 
  generally interpreters are rare and busy though , you might have to try your luck with the people that speak english . 
  then you also have the issue that people are tired , scared and not in a very talkative mood - it is not fun to get here at all and people have other problems than talking to strangers about their reasons . 
  often having family abroad or knowing someone who escaped to a certain country is a big motivation . 
  in general reasons are quite diverse though , so interviews will only give you so much insight ... also they will likely be cherry picked to show the poor war refugee or the economic migrant , as you probably will manage to find both types . 
  what about german speaking non german countries ?!, 
  / triggered, 
  as said elsewhere german planes are either stationed abroad or eol with the replacement delayed . 
  also it is not the job of the military to deport civilians . 
  also deportations are state business in germany , so that means either you lock them up for a while until you can fill a plane , coordinate nationally on e.g. 
  a `` deportation day '' or use learjets and a black budget like the cia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rendition_aircraft ) . 
  moving ( suspected ) terrorists and deporting people is also a different department by the way , probably even in the us ... 
  greece needs money , not dignity . 
  but the airlines they use ca n't be forced to take a kicking and screaming passenger on board ... 
  worked with alcohol in the us too ... 
   coming ** directly ** from a territory is the part you probably meant ? 
  what `` coming directly '' means is the big question , the section you highlighted means that they need to apply asap wherever they decide to flee to . 
  ever filed a patent ? 
  it is not even hard to write , patents are shorter than your typical bachelor 's thesis and during research you see enough other patents that you get the typical language down too ... 
  meanwhile : http://www.epo.org/about-us/annual-reports-statistics/statistics/top.html - about every 30 minutes one of the top 10 applicants apply for a patent . 
  that 's because most leave by themselves . 
  say what ? 
  the only `` right '' you as an individual get added in schengen is to not show your passport when moving to germany - you can already live and work there , schengen or not . 
   but there are laws , like registering in the first safe country . 
  actually there are n't ... at least not in the 1951 refugee convention . 
  the dublin system of the eu also just states that you can send a refugee back to the first country they registered in ( probably to make sure countries like germany and austria can delegate that stuff to the border countries like spain , italy and greece ) . 
  schengen only would eliminate border checks ( and some other things ) , you already have free movement as an eu member . 
  there 's nothing stopping you from moving to germany and earning 7-8 times more if you are a romanian citizen . 
  jan - aug 2015 ( latest official report : http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/bmi_asylwesen/statistik/files/2015/asylstatistik_august_2015.pdf , new ones appear on http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/bmi_asylwesen/statistik/start.aspx ) 46.133 applications ( preliminary numbers , there might be more ) unfortunately i could n't find the split between positive/negative decisions taken , historically they are about 50/50 in austria , but of course vary a lot depending on the country of origin . 
  i am wrong because outside of these temporary exceptions , it is legal . 
  see the text i quoted in https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3qjc6s/austria_to_build_slovenia_border_fence_the_local/cwfsfoo, 
  ah , i checked and ( outside of special cases like right now where countries can announce for a limited time that borders will be checked ) it apparently is legal for anyone to cross internal schengen borders : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=uriserv:l14514  internal borders  any person , irrespective of his/her nationality , may cross the internal borders at any point without checks being carried out . 
  this does not preclude the possibility for the the national police authorities to exercise their powers , including in the internal border zones , provided that this exercise does not have an effect equivalent to border checks . 
   [ ... ] where there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security , these countries may exceptionally reintroduce border controls at its internal borders for a period of no more than 30 days ( possible to prolong under conditions established by the code ) or for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat . 
  this action should be seen as a last resort . 
  if such controls are to be reintroduced , the other eu countries that are part of the schengen area and the european commission must be notified without delay with a view to possible consultations . 
  the european parliament and the council must be informed at the same time . 
  because they do n't deescalate and just keep the status quo . 
  also `` not solving all problems '' ! = `` inherently useless '' ( which means `` not solving any problems '' ) . 
  -- franz niemand , political activist from eastern germany , june 1961, 
  how many were granted ? 
  just check out `` spielfeld '' on google maps . 
  they seem to sometimes see `` deutschlandsberg '' ( `` deutschland '' = germany in german ) on signs and think it is only a few km left , i doubt that they intentionally want to walk to graz to move on ...  also , there is a risk that if registration is too slow , they will tear down the fence and go thorough it . 
  already happened ( no tear gas was used ... ) , now they are kept in an area before the registration guarded by the military , which seems to help . 
  check out http://www.kleinezeitung.at/s/steiermark/4853101/ for today 's live ticker and some pictures . 
  fraktus are far more influential !, 
  even inside schengen area countries it is illegal to cross the border outside of border stations ( called `` green border '' / `` gr\u00fcne grenze '' in german ) . 
  edit : i 'm wrong : http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=uriserv:l14514, 
   what will you do if 2000 migrants decide to walk the 10 km and go around ? 
  tell the slovenians to fish them out of the water/tell the hungarians that a few hundred dead people are floating in the water if the slovenians do n't get them out ( to the east ) or register them at the checkpoint ( in the opening of the fence or to the west ) . 
  because yahoo is not a credible/primary news source , often contains spam and is banned probably site wide . 
  as a mod ( !? ), 
  you should know that ? 
  if not , ask your colleagues . 
  sorry , but recording and transcribing personal talks is not my thing , i 'm not a reporter . 
  i 'm sure there are volunteer opportunities in hungary too , feel free to go there and conduct some interview instead of helping . 
  the last point is actually kinda true ( but then again , free buses is not something `` austria '' usually provides - it is just cheaper to register them and ship them to the german border than to try to keep them here ) . 
  buses do n't magically appear out of the blue , so they have to be ordered etc. 
  this causes quite some lag time between people arriving and buses leaving . 
  when i want to travel to serbia , hungary can look/be as nice and hospitable and worthy of spending my time there as it wants , i 'm still looking to get through as fast as possible . 
  enough feeding the trolls here , i 'm out to do something more helpful than arguing with people on the internet . 
  they sleep next to tents , not in a train station with camps kilometers away . 
  also i personally am condemning hungary for police brutality and being horribly bad at deescalation , not for people sleeping in keleti . 
  graz is less than one hour away , in case you have n't heard about it : it 's the second largest city of austria .
