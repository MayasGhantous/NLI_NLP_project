  i doubt that it will have any gates - just look at the map : it needs to be only a few km long to keep people from going around checkpoints and there 's a river on one end and the next border station at the other end . 
  while people might try to get through rivers ( apparently 2 not so smart individuals tried to swim to germany recently - they are now in hospital ) , i doubt that there will be many trying that . 
   fact is : they are sleeping outside in the cold at location x in austria for whatever reason . 
  ** at location x you do n't give them heated tents . 
  ** they surely have a reason to sleep there instead of in the cold . 
  a sane person would go sleep in the heated tent unless there is something they get at location x that they do n't get in the tent . 
  why do n't you give them that thing in the camp , too , if austria treats them so well ? 
  the highlighted section is wrong . 
  the reason they camp outside is that they think ( wrongly ) that they would be ahead of the queue for buses to germany the next day . 
  while being wrong about that opportunity , they often do n't really believe authorities that tell them they are wrong . 
  thus it is a perfectly valid and sane reason . 
  there are also people camping outside cinemas for star wars movies for example , for similar reasons ( but there they actually have a chance of getting in first , since cinemas do n't operate the same way as a transit shelter ) . 
  my judgment does not only come from media . 
   is making them sleep outside in the cold `` quite good treatment '' in the austrian sense ? 
  nope , but a couple of them do n't want to enter tents since they hope to be in front of the line for buses the next day . 
   anyway , if they do n't comply , you 'll have to spray them with water and tear gas as your interior minister has already announced they 'd do . 
  a month ago ... mrs. mikl-leitner has already issues remembering what she said/promised last week . 
  how are less than 10 kilometer of fence ( ? ), 
  that ensure people next to a border crossing do n't cross a few hundred meters in the field , walk around the camp there and jump the bus line comparable to what hungary did ? 
  also refugees are treated quite well in austria , both in transit and asylum seekers ... something that did n't always happen in hungary , hopefully the situation for better there now . 
   well , yes . 
  however there are correct and incorrect interpretations , as always . 
  got a decision by the ecj or similar courts as proof or is that rather what you personally believe or perceive as `` correct '' ? 
  it is our gangsta city , yo !, 
  no , only their weapons and partner countries . 
  depends a lot on the interpretation of the 1951 refugee convention ... most likely it is ok if you go through turkey to other countries . 
  staying in turkey for a few months and then moving away from there is a different story and will increase the chance of deportation a lot . 
  ... a country like africa , amirite ? 
  i find the bars growing to the sky a bit misleading , could you add an ( optional , since it will totally squish the numbers ) `` compared to the number of citizens '' bar too ? 
  austrian asylum ( not migration ) stats are available here : http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/bmi_asylwesen/statistik/start.aspx migration stats etc. 
  are here : http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/bmi_niederlassung/statistiken/, 
  yes , for stuff like student council . 
  never for actual elections . 
  except for the ( useless ) online voting stuff , you can still do a lot with it , most of the stuff estonians can do are possible with the austrian id as well . 
  depends on how many documents you bring with you and what 's your country of origin mostly as well as the reason ( s ) you are applying for asylum . 
  if you are from kosovo , you 'll be denied almost instantly . 
  like transferring vote results on the ( already used ) usb stick of a developer or posting wifi passwords in view of the official cameras while running machines that interact with votes on that network ? 
  you can not vote with the austrian e-card . 
  if you are a refugee , you have certain rights . 
  these people are applying to be recognised as refugees and their application takes more than half a year to be processed . 
   there 's actually no way to preform a virginity test it 's not that hard to think of a procedure that always tests negative ... 
  time to move all your police to the coast then !, 
  they are already integrating !, 
  no , eu official languages are official at the eu level , not in the country . 
  you are not allowed to hand in a tax form in spanish . 
  you can try pushing for military action on the ground in syria ( the `` world police '' approach ) , work in your free time to integrate immigrants better in your society ( `` embrace and extinguish '' approach ) ... 
  and people with these views and experiences are usually busy helping instead of talking about it . 
  if they do n't speak german , they are not central . 
  suck it , czechs !, 
  i must have done it wrong then . 
  because in a few months we 'll send them back to you . 
  not every one of them is a fit , healthy 20 something ... 
  problem with trains from hungary was for example that they were overcrowded . 
  this meant in austria they had to be emptied , 2 trains for every 1 train that arrived ( unscheduled ) provided and then the next ones come etc. 
  most came back to the border the same day ... 
  it is not unlikely that they saw a sign that `` deutschlandsberg '' is only a few km away . 
  if you want them to go away , sign up at https://helfen.st.roteskreuz.at/ to help get them going to germany asap .

  i already said too much - just look it up , the puzzle pieces are out there in plain sight for you to piece together as soon as you start ignoring the bought media and ignorant masses that are just too blind to see the truth !, 
  there are powerful , powerful forces at work and they do n't like to be messed with , start by educating yourself about real education , real knowledge and real events that happened throughout history which led up to this point in time where i meet you online to tell you to wake up and start thinking for yourself !, 
  just do n't go to the bielefeld anonymous meetings ... they are monitoring them !, 
  you 've lived exactly in bi_l_f_ld or only nearby ? 
  do you have actual proof that the town/city you lived in was bi_l_f_ld and not just a place nearby with fake city signs etc. ? 
  it is entirely possible that by now they just renamed a place that 's outside the zone to match people 's expectations ... did you just stop at the first place that said `` bielefeld '' and looked plausible enough when moving there or did you actually check if you arrived at the correct place ? 
  they have hides , they could make leather ... 
  they have infiltrated reddit now apparently too !, 
  i do n't want to state or not state that bi \\* l \\* f \\* ld does exist or not exist ... but i just know one single person claiming to be from there and she was n't even able to show any pictures she took there that were not taken with a digital device or already on the internet . 
  there are still far more people coming in from hungary than slovenia by the way ... yesterday was the first day that nobody came ( the day before : ~ 4000 ) . 
  sources ( german ) : http://burgenland.orf.at/news/stories/2737529/ - hungarian border http://steiermark.orf.at/news/stories/2737503/ - slovenian border i personally doubt that austria is going to close borders before germany does , but if germany shuts down , who knows ... 
   i mean i 'm 24 and i would really like some pension in 45 or so years . 
  start saving then ... 
  they will likely claim to be 17 years old , not 5 ... as the process often lasts several months , it is only natural to turn `` 18 '' after it ends .

  in southern austria one of the busiest organizations to help refugees is the muslim youth organization ( besides red cross , caritas and other `` professional '' aid organizations of course ) . 
  they also work very well together with the other organizations . 
  sorry , but that 's for family only ...
