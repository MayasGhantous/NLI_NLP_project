  also these 2 government officials are from 2 different parties - and guess which is the more right wing one ... 
  card contains certificate , chrome can access certificate ( e.g. 
  to sign transactions or for logging in somewhere ), 
  no , the cards did not keep the specs , chrome finally enforced them . 
  why ? 
  hardware bugs exist and are widespread ... 
  your cpu that you are using to browse reddit has several bugs for sure . 
  austrian dialects are a `` bit '' more diverse than what is shown in the picture . 
   they were always a part of the german nation until 1945 austrofascism begs to differ ... 
  i still stand by my opinion that it is not `` extremely dangerous '' to be sprayed by a powder extinguisher , with the exception of someone holding the nozzle to your mouth or similar ( which i would call `` large quantity '' inhaled ) . 
  the fire that you are extinguishing is releasing more toxic and more dangerous chemicals than your extinguisher , just use common sense and do n't empty it all in the car while sitting in it for example . 
  acting as if getting hit by a bit of baking soda dust is `` extremely dangerous '' might lead to people not using proper equipment to put out fires . 
  i agree with the article that often in training it is glossed over how the powder actually works - but then again the author also does not explain it and only speaks of `` chemicals '' . 
  again , i read it and i agree that inhaling baking soda in large quantities is dangerous . 
  you still did not say if you think that there is a different chemical in there or what amounts are dangerous . 
  the powder is not toxic and you could kill someone the same way by blasting flour or tiny confetti in his/her lungs . 
  this article is about hospital safety by the way , a place where it might not be a smart idea to fill a room where patients are with powdery dust in the first place . 
  i did ... so what chemical is contained in an abc powder extinguisher according to the article instead ? 
  thousands of people coming to a small country per day is risky if they ca n't pass through but might have to stay . 
  the source is so bad that editorializing would only make it better ... 
  they are full of baking soda ... 
  surely not the most pleasant substance to inhale in large quantities , but not very deadly either . 
  it does n't have to be something huge ... an example would be toilets . 
  also check out how many marriages get divorced each year - these are between 2 people from mostly similar cultures who even swear oaths to stay together and still they start fighting after some time . 
  even better in german : der see is a lake , die see is the poetic version of the sea . 
  time to ask for trashy arab songs ... 
  no , this time you join us !, 
  fake , there is no sauna on the list ... 
  well , there were fewer bombings , of course there are more pretty buildings left ... 
  i find a few of their songs funny and the video to life is live is so over the top that i 'd call it ridiculous ... 
  danish ? 
  definitely toy box then !,

  why not laibach ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb9lobwclfq :d, 
  or the favourite pastime of dutch people in austria apparently : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bkq_tfacfs, 
  well , there are more trashy songs about food : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elrptal_ori - trackshittaz - schnitzi ( only lyrics , i could n't find a proper video ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo7mwuj7zla - takeo ischi - new bibi hendl ( not 100 % sure if it is from austria or germany ) also official videos from the eav are generally funny/weird but not trashy ( e.g. 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpsgqbaye_q - bank\u00fcberfall or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyilspsydw8 ding dong ), 
  yeah , i wanted to check out austrian songs that managed to become number 1 hits ... they also have a song about the enterprise : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eepcjgyhe4u, 
  i was more expecting something like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sccugztl-uc ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8jgf-f5pbc - edelweiss - bring me edelweiss ( an actual number 1 hit in austria at that time ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je_fu4c1u9u - sbg hot boys clique feat . 
  of all places - apparently it is far more ghetto than you might expect ! ), 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8n_kmgvjxk - trackshittaz - oida taunz !, 
  ( also a number 1 hit , they nearly would have gone to the eurovision contest in 2011 , went in 2012 ( beating conchita wurst in the national round ) and promptly managed to reach the last place in the semifinals ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcryjkyddxm - hoch tirol - konis hupen ( the `` joke '' is that `` koni '' sounds like `` conny '' - so `` konis hupen '' could mean `` connys honkers '' ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyklpjwckkc - die jungen zillertaler - auf der bruck trara ( video is not that bad but the lyrics are wtf worthy ( `` on the bridge trara lies barbara and is a bit crumpled trara from her dude and she hopes trara that often in the future trara he 'll squash her again trara on the bridge '' ) , `` trara '' is just something like `` lala '' without meaning ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9pmh3aipv4 - hc strache feat . 
  mc blue - good men [ sch ] rap ( yes , the h.c. strache , right wing politician and leader of the fp\u00d6 , he has several songs by the way ), 
  weird , a few yaears ago i was shopping on amazon.co.uk because thanks to the then crashed pound it was cheaper to pay for shipping than to buy from . de ... 
  and especially fuck those who offer free shipping for germans and charge 20 $ + for sending a lightbulb to austria . 
   you do nearly nothing and your life standard goes up yeah , but then again you still are in poland ... weird language , have to build a social circle or stay in the expat bubble and it 's not like just having a nicer flat magically makes the area nicer , provides fast internet or whatever else one considers essential . 
  it might be nice for a while , but moving countries to get a few classes better living conditions is still a big step . 
  yes and no , depends on who does the labelling . 
  fp\u00d6 on one hand is mostly populistic and being nearly constantly in the opposition role it is easy to complain about every single error the ruling parties make . 
  on the other hand they have some more extreme members that even get into trouble with the law concerning the ban of nazi propaganda from time to time . 
  as they 've grown a lot in the past few years , i expect that their far right end might get a bit diluted since they now need more new members and if they manage to get into a regional/national government , they also have to face the reality that complaining is n't enough to lead - which will make them a bit more unpopular to their voters again . 
  maybe in germany , the austrian one does have far reaching powers that were just not really enacted so far . 
  he tweeted the state hymn of burgenland ( the easternmost state of austria ) not the national hymn ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/land_der_berge,_land_am_strome ) which only in the third stanza talks about walking `` free and faithful '' into the new ages - no mention of faith in any god in particular or towards any god at all . 
  http://diepresse.com/home/meinung/cultureclash/5106595/worte-haben-konsequenzen ( `` we could say something about if the program of the fp\u00d6 or hofer 's statements deserve the `` christian '' tag . 
  but the help of god ? 
  especially a sinner is deserving of it . '' ), 
  as far as i understood it : the pope can voice some private opinions that can be wrong or right , however if they are given in his official function as a pope ( usually in various texts and letters ) they are considered infallible . 
  so if he says `` that pizzeria nearby really is the best !, 
  '' , it does n't mean that every catholic now has to accept this as a fact , however if he states in an official text that from hereby onwards it is ok to read the bible at mass in the local language too ( something that would have been unthinkable a few 100 years ago and that got quite a few people killed ) this is a new quasi fact to be carried out . 
  the unbiased media channels outside of the l\u00fcgenpresse probably ... / s, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blasphemy_law < -- list of countries where they do have a place so far in the 21st century . 
  i 'd rather have another war than another nuke . 
  really this one ? 
  then the jihadism stuff is even more hilarious , since it is quite strongly against the issue . 
  song is by texta and some romanian rapper and quite good ... 
  why , do n't you learn german any more down in the provinces ? 
  just look at the name for starters !, 
  ran a car through the city center wounding dozens and killing a few . 
  currently on trial , when it finishes i can tell you if he was crazy or not . 
  the last big killing spree in my city was by a balkan born guy ... 
  great , go take the next plane to libya and check for a good location !, 
  how about hungary ? 
  probably staffed by europeans though . 
  from hungary ? 
  probably not ... 
  especially considering tesla studied in austria ... 
  andere = others in german . 
  applications per million , not actual people ... in the case of hungary a big difference . 
  thank the iron lady for that ... 
  in a few years you 'll say the same with the nhs instead of british rail . 
  geneva convention on refugees , letter c point 1 directly contradicts your statement ... 
  yes . 
  so when will you finnish peasants finally reunite with sweden ?!, 
  about the same offensive level ... 
  yeah , that 's why they do n't take back people who applied there and went on to austria for example ... 
  you could let them wear ids or license plates visibly ? 
  it was never forbidden to begin with ... 
  yeah , there are dozens of them out there , dozens !, 
  the one has nothing to do with the other ... 
  15 $ according to https://www.help.gv.at/portal.node/hlpd/public/content/12/seite.120810.html#kosten maybe something needed to be translated ? 
  huh ? 
  simplified english ... 
  armenia has a huge diaspora , georgia not so much . 
  depends on your accent i guess , but i doubt that it would be a nice experience or end positively . 
  well , do you speak the language from there ? 
  you better take the bus for that . 
  translates to `` beach '' by the way . 
  or being brown in slovakia ...
