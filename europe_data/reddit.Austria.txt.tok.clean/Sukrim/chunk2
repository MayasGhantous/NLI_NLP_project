  i 've been in a lot of places where i could feel comfortable ( if i spoke the language well ) for quite some time , there is no place like home though . 
  at least in some parts it looks similar . 
  you 'd have a harder time filming it in tokio or brasilia for example . 
  while main attractions do n't look very similar ( castle ... ) lots of the streets definitely have this neoclassic style that is quite common all over the continent . 
  amadeus ( the movie ) took place in vienna but was shot in prague ( http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/a/amadeus.html ) . 
  well , in austria while there are a few places that tourists apparently `` have '' to visit ( salzburg , vienna and apparently hallstadt [ the city that 's right next to a lake , you 'll see pictures in / r/pics popping up from time to time ] ) and you can get ripped off there by buying weird souvenirs or expensive drinks/food . 
  however they are still nice places to check out . 
  stuff that i consider a waste of money ( sound of music tour anyone ? ), 
  might be the only time in the lives of some others to experience the area and who am i to judge that ? 
  that being said , once restaurants start putting up english menus outside , have overly ambitious displays of mozart , `` authentic '' , `` original '' or `` traditional '' on their flyers ( and hand out flyers in the first place ) be prepared to spend an extra 20 % or more just for being a tourist , because locals would n't go there anyways . 
  also please do n't buy lederhosen , real ones are crazy expensive anyways ( starting at ~ 400 $ ) and cheap ones look bad - there are companies that make swimming shorts that kinda look like lederhosen ( http://www.amazon.de/badehose-lederhose/s?page=1&amp;rh=i%3aaps%2ck%3abadehose%20lederhose ) , buy one of these if you have to , then you can even wear them from time to time . 
  you were in the wrong parts of prague then , but yeah , there are a few streets where you just try to sneak through as quickly as possible and move on . 
  king 's road or golden road or something like that ? 
  well , if it is in rome , it likely is roman . 
  it 's called `` piefkinesisch '' and it 's definitely not proper german !, 
  i see some serious language issues in baltica , danovia , cisalpina , rumelia and a few others coming up , funny idea though . 
   an interesting exercise would be to make this interactive : how would it look like if you do not break up at districts but at the state level ? 
  with only 25 countries ? 
  with 60 ? 
  trying to cluster as compact as possible or trying to keep the population numbers as close to each other as possible ? 
  why berlin and not linz ? 
  under austrian rule , you had tesla ... :-p, 
  wow , so you 're not even stuck in the 20th but in the 19th ( ! ), 
  century in your thinking ? 
  editorialized title , fp\u00d6 is not defined or primarily `` nationalistic '' . 
  no , but the article also states they already found several places and the only issue was the dog , so it can only be a matter of time until she finds something suitable . 
  she has still more than half a year to look for a place - my flat can be cancelled with only 3 months notice for example . 
  yeah , with a 90 m \u00b2 flat for herself and her cat and dog . 
  she very likely signed a contract that allows this to happen . 
  why would they mix it with coke ?!, 
  oh , the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/panopticon theory ... maybe time to move on from late 18th century views ? 
  i 'd say yes - you might want to drink a ma\u00df or 2 before watching it the first time , then watch it again sober some time later ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5pm3oyeky8 ;-), 
   retarded https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eobokxecvaa, 
  6 million people ... 
  i 'd probably wear a bra and a less tacky dirndl , otherwise pretty spot on . 
   do people in germany have a right to get shit faced in public , vomit everywhere , but still protect their privacy ? 
  yes . 
  there 's a difference between `` you can be seen in public '' and `` you can be recorded in public and this recording can be indefinitely published globally '' . 
  that 's like going to las vegas to find out how venice looks like ... 
  you realize that these are mostly tourists , right ? 
  friends do n't let friends go to oktoberfest in the first place ... 
  uhm , maybe look for a website that is not titled `` munich pukes '' ? 
  they also should add the `` 0 '' countries ... 
  you know wrong : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#net_contributors_and_recipients 1 czech gets about as much money as 1 german + 1 austrian pay into the eu combined . 
  e\u015fantionul a fost validat pe baza datelor oficiale ale recens\u0103m\u00e2ntului popula\u0163iei din 2011 percentages with precisions down to 1/1000th combined with no sample size in the graphic always make me nervous . 
  strategies to disperse and integrate refugees and migrants as much as possible to combat ghettofication asap . 
  examples are maximum amounts of people in a single refugee home and quotas down to municipality level . 
  no big centers/camps !, 
  allow pre-registration at embassies/in camps . 
  estonia tries something along these lines with their `` electronic citizenship '' . 
  if you 're able to get a nice eu id with biometrics that does n't really entitle you to anything but that ensures you 're in the schengen id system in case you want to come here and apply for asylum and can be easily identified might be useful . 
  unfortunately biometrics are a shitty way to identify someone and `` dna '' tests are also commonly not what you think they are ( they do n't check the whole dna , only a few small fragments ) . 
  something along these lines might be useful though . 
  punish non-schengen countries heavily that do n't protect their own border and even sponsor buses etc. 
  to get people further north . 
  looking at you , cia-black-site-host macedonia for example !, 
  after a certain amount of accepted refugees from a certain country or region , some measures should be taken - it simply ca n't be that on one hand it is accepted that people from a certain place will face death there so they should be rescued if they make it here but on the other hand nobody even speaks out or acts against the source of this issue . 
  make the originating country pay for refugees !, 
  not always an option , but balkan countries for example could start to pay reparations soon for their refugees in the 90s . 
  all in all : make sure that something like the `` hey , we 're respecting human rights , anyone who wants to claim asylum here can do so - they are just not allowed to come via plane , ship , car , by foot or through any border with our neighbouring countries '' excuse does n't work any more . 
  do n't want to take in 10k refugees in vatican city ? 
  fair enough , but a certain minimum amount of spaces should be available per country . 
  if someone like the nato can demand a certain amount of military spending , eu can demand a certain amount of humanitarian aid too . 
  edit : because i just read something about these lines : grant asylum based on criteria and properly track these criteria . 
  the idea that all people with refugee status need to be checked every few months just to be able to make asylum a temporary measure is not a reality any more with `` modern '' technology . 
  knowing who is here because state x in country had a civil war is a single database query away . 
  once this condition is not valid any more ( maybe evaluated every quarter or so , give these intelligence agencies actually something useful to do !, 
  ) , send a letter to everyone affected notifying them that they would either need to show additional proof that they can still not return ( example : `` there 's no more war but i 'm also homosexual and would face problems even in the new regime '' ) or that they need to give proof that they left the country by date x ( e.g. 
  show up at the consulate/embassy in the region ) . 
  this would make asylum not 100 % time limited , but at least would make it more understandable for the local population as well as making it as easy as possible to check . 
  the criteria on what area in the world is considered safe should also be 100 % the same for all schengen countries . 
   huge nah , my body mass index is quite ok ...  fucking ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 )  refugee-apologist i 'm still not 100 % sure where to stand on this issue , until i am i personally have decided to help as much as i can locally for immediate problems ( e.g. 
  providing shelter ) . 
   that 's your problem . 
  at least you seem to have a problem with it ? 
  thanks for the diagnosis . 
  economy is not only about money ... but yes , i agree that in your case you apparently also seem to feel a strong connection to a country where socks + sandals fit well together . 
  ;-) if you are repatriated , why did n't you simply get your citizenship right away ? 
  apparently you had to stay on a visa/residence permit , so you were/are a us citizen , not a german one . 
  this means at least you are a migrant . 
  if you were hoping to be better off in germany than the us , you are very close to the definition of an economic migrant ... 
  https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/11/hungary-abysmal-conditions-border-detention is something i found after quick googling . 
  since hungary supposedly has emptied these camps by now and shipped the inmates to the austrian border , it is not unlikely that reports like the one above are a result . 
  refugees are not illegal and are not expected/required to integrate . 
  illegals are illegal and definitely do not have it easy at all . 
  from the article :  eurostat , the eu 's official statistics agency , claims 217,000 migrants arrived in the eu in april , may and june this year . 
  [ ... ] syrians made up 44,000 of these figures . 
  so 20 % of q2/2015 in all migrants of europe were from syria . 
  later in the article :  of course , the figures only show the breakdown for the beginning of this year . 
  half a million people have arrived in europe so far this year with 156,000 arriving in august alone . 
  so about 300k people are not in this sample and the amount is still increasing . 
  your statement was :  only around 20 % of all refugees are syrian . 
  the only correct statement would have been : `` only around 20 % of all migrants in q2/2015 were syrian according to eurostat . '', 
  the numbers are from april , may and june ... most refugees started arriving at austrian borders in august and september . 
  guess what , 5 years ago even fewer asylum seekers were from syria , who would have thought ? 
  well , what do you expect from someone who posts a heavily editorialized titled video ? 
  go help in a few shelters then ... 
  i especially do n't believe your 20 % figure by the way . 
  meh , they will get registered anyways , just not on slovenian ground or between borders but in the camp they were brought to .
