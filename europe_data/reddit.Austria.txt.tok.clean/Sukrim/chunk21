  bitcoin down even worse , nearly 3 % compared to yesterday in usd . 
  you do n't think i can read your reddit history , mr viennese guy ? 
  trolls like you are the reason people are not so helpful online any more . 
  so with which party should they form a coalition ? 
  \u00d6vp again ? 
  they managed to even cause them to split up the whole party , would never accept strache as chancellor and probably even have a hard time convincing their base of this deal in the first place . 
  even worse , no way with h\u00e4upl sitting on his throne . 
  edit : hofer also was polling well : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_austrian_presidential_election,_2016, 
  if you fulfill the criteria , sure - if just as a tourist , anytime !, 
  just read this . 
  thanks for the info . 
  will ignore idiot from across the ocean . 
  because zero tolerance policies are not popular or realistic at all . 
  right now the fp\u00d6 seems to be more nebulously claiming that there are `` too many '' ( without giving any indication how many would be fine ) and that they are `` dangerous '' ( again : no actual measurables given ) . 
  hofer wanted to be seen as more likeable , taking a harsh stance would n't have helped him . 
  how about we start with the americans on / r/europe ? 
  / r/the _ hofer seems to be leaking ... 
  the opposite rhetoric is `` lower educated aka . 
  too stupid to realize they 're being played '' . 
  no error bars , no conclusion . 
  idiocy knows no borders , also there is a difference between sharing values and exercising them . 
  what 's globalist about it anyways ? 
  that 's his personal assistant . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_lugner nope , just no ... he was probably the most independent candidate ( besides griss ) in this year 's elections . 
  i still have a tab open , one of their last posts was : `` remember the president is just a figure head and does n't have any real power . 
  what matters is the chancellor which the fpo party needs to win in 2018 which they 're leading by almost 10 points . 
  it wo n't be close as today but be ready for that . '', 
  by user zodiact10 ( zodiact90 is the founder of the_hofer , maybe a sock puppet or just an alt-right meme name ... ) . 
  there are only the mail votes to count tomorrow and they wo n't be able to change the result . 
  hofer already admitted defeat . 
  oh really ? 
  what was his/her name ? 
  ( https://dict.leo.org/dictquery/m-vocab/ende/de.html?search=not+even ), 
  repeating an election because of faulty envelopes is not enough ? 
  ... literal ? 
  nope , die gr\u00fcnen are not the kp\u00d6 . 
  yes , since the guy was relatively popular , the candidates from major parties sucked and the final election is a 1 vs. 1 runoff . 
  because more people voted for him . 
  not really . 
  there are probably some more in depth breakdowns in the top level comments . 
  thanks , we 'll rule in peace for sure !, 
  people got relatively creative , one of my favourites was a poster with an added red nose and the tag `` warning : horror clowns on the loose ! '', 
  he stepped out of active politics a while back , the president in austria does not have much direct influence on climate policies . 
  keeping all their salty tears and cringe posts to themselves i guess ? 
  at least the germans in / r/the _ schulz seem to go full steam ahead ... :d, 
  no need to wait , some americans apparently started / r/the _ hofer . 
  might motivate both sides more to take part in elections ( increasing voter turnout ) - the ones that are pro-populist right wingers to `` prevent another disaster '' and the progressive ones ( or anti-populist right wingers ) `` since there still is hope out there '' . 
  my hope is that this leads to a better climate in total , with right wingers realizing that just making outlandish claims and spweing hate is not enough to win elections without some actual program behind ( hofer was actually quite good in this regard most of the time ) and the rest of the bunch being a bit more motivated and actually approaching their base again a bit more openly . 
  nope , looking at results per state would also mean that vdb likely would have won . 
  however campaigns might look differently in such a system ... ? 
  anyways , with the current result , fptp voting of states weighed by population would also lead to the same end result . 
  why ? 
  he was fairly popular over there !, 
  technically the usa have n't even voted yet for their president ... 
  thanks for getting occupied and taking one for the team !, 
  learn to spell fp\u00d6 correctly , also they were not on the ballot , only their candidate was . 
  but it even says `` gl on ass '' when spelled correctly !, 
  lots of these slogans would make excellent bedroom talk ... 
   pay the libyans which ones ? 
  it is about germans vs. `` others '' - germans abroad commit more crimes than germans in germany . 
  why ? 
   the fact of the matter is , `` refugees '' commit a disproportionate amount of crime in comparison to native germans , so overall crime statistics hold no weight in any argument in that regard . 
  compared to native germans in the respective age and social group or all native germans in general ? 
  in austria , germans are in the top 3 of foreign crime and unemployment ... 
  so have you served in your country 's army ? 
  probably not 100 % all ( as it would just take a single case to disprove this ) , but definitely not like in the us of a who have a huge amount of unregistered illegals . 
   deportations are not enforced , they just stay . 
  under an article with the headline `` germany to deport thousands of afghans '' . 
  suuuure ... 
  it is explicitly part of the dublin agreement that countries can either make the country of entry responsible or choose to house the refugee themselves . 
  geneva convention also allows countries to volunteer in housing refugees as long as they are properly treated . 
  protecting murderers is not a leftist issue ... 
  i would expect swiss click towers to have a seconds arm as well ... 
  taking fingerprints is part of the asylum application process in the whole eu . 
  one issue is that some countries try to take as long as possible to even start the process in the hopes that potential applicants just give up and go apply elsewhere . 
   i ca n't find the article to the un report now . 
  but i 'll keep looking for the article . 
  great , thanks . 
  looking forward to the actual un report then and not some third party sources ( if even ) . 
  after all you seem to ask for sources quite often too , so you surely know how frustrating it is , if someone just claims something exists and then never follows up . 
   now the un has reported the more than 90 % are economic migrants !, 
  in which report ? 
  would be great to have a link . 
   we can build a comprehensive database of migrants who land in italy ( via fingerprinting ) which is then linked across all eu&eea states . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurodac this is already about 14 years old by now . 
  so the `` nobody was ever fired for buying ibm '' is wrong now ? 
  yes, 
  why not use chf though , if weight is a concern ? 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7pk1tl2vjo - austria at least has real mountains , not stupid hills !, 
  true , the second republic was founded in 1955 . 
  it does n't even exist for half a century as a country yet ... 
  there 's a study about the feasibility of that and he would not be able to do that . 
  yeah , i mixed it with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lands_of_the_bohemian_crown in my head, 
  ah , i misremembered , the area was called just the `` kingdom of bohemia '' apparently in imperial times . 
   the nazi reference huh ? 
  similar to `` christians '' on reddit and the assumptions made about `` all christians '' by atheists here as well . 
   is it not ? 
  no , it is not . 
  i did n't say that it is completely comparable . 
  neither did i claim that there are constant islamic terror attacks in europe by the way .
