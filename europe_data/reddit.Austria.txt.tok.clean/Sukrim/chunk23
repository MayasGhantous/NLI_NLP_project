  the concept of `` i fancy that girl from my english class , anyone knows her name ? '', 
  does n't really apply for example . 
  no , but harambe was on second place : https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/52mkho/abstimmungsthread_teil_2_utotenmesse_ist_vater/, 
  no , / r/de is for german speakers , not germans . 
  nearly all of these differences also apply to germany vs. switzerland , maybe except the anal sex part ( i 'm sure there is a cute swiss-german term for that though , like `` arschl\u00f6chlistupfen '' ) . 
  `` sich hart g\u00f6nnen '' is a german idiom ( kinda means `` party hard , enjoy life '' ) , there was a thread where someone asked / r/de how to name his newborn and `` g\u00f6nnhart '' was the clear winner . 
  i doubt hat op followed through though , probably the suggestion was vetoed by other involved parties . 
  what 's the difference between belgium and the netherlands then ? 
  latin !, 
  i knew it would come in handy eventually !, 
  the officially / r/de approved name is g\u00f6nnhart , though i 'm not so sure about that one ... 
  not recent , but `` was n\u00fctzt die liebe in gedanken '' ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325733/ ) is missing in your list . 
  we have a youtube channel for that ( ~ 10-15 minute versions of famous literature ) : https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucsa4rnmvfbblgkewqcungxq, 
  there are team categories/rankings on both of them , but yeah , they are not mainly played as teams . 
  not downhill skiing or formula 1 ? 
  depends if op means people taking part in these sports or watching them on tv or considering themselves `` fans '' of an athlete/team . 
  running in general is probably as widespread as playing football for example for actual activities , though not exactly against the clock . 
  and definitely another european nation . 
  something eastern european . 
  looking good, 
  the catholic party '' \u00d6vp '' still is going strong , so not illegal either . 
  depends on the definition of `` city '' , but yes , hallstatt is officially not a city ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/liste_der_st%c3%a4dte_in_%c3%96sterreich ), 
  what ?!, 
  your mcd does n't sell beer ? 
  in austria they do ... 
  according to tourists probably either hallstatt , vienna or salzburg . 
  we do n't really have ugly cities , sorry . 
  maybe some ugly parts ... 
  if you have to pass time by meaningless chatter , maybe you should try to find a hobby or something ... 
  also universally useful : picture dictionaries , but in the end it 'll be quite hard to not fine someone around you with at least basic english skills anyways . 
  in case you want to go hiking in the mountains : make sure to tell hut owners along the way where you come from and where you 're going . 
  it helps a lot in case you are getting lost . 
  also about hiking : wear proper gear ( shoes !, 
  ) , always ( ! ), 
  carry some water and a few snacks , some warm clothes ( higher up there still is snow up until july/august ) , a flashlight and nowadays maybe a power bank for your mobile phone . 
  on average about one person per day dies in the alps . 
  please do n't be one of them . 
  in cities : do n't spend all your money at once and be a bit skeptical if e.g. 
  restaurants try to look all `` typical '' but only have english menus and everything is expensive there . 
  tipping is something that is not expected in serious amounts , you usually just round up a bit what you pay to limit the amount of change you get ( e.g. 
  instead of 14.60 $ you pay 15 $ ) . 
  no need to calculate `` appropriate percentages '' or anything . 
  it is also totally fine if you do n't tip at all , though in touristy areas waiters might hope for high tips from americans . 
  last but not least : relax and enjoy your time . 
  just take an afternoon off from `` touristy things '' , buy a can/bottle of beer and/or a book and chill out in a public park or at the lakeside in z\u00fcrich . 
   for years source ? 
   refugee flees to first safe area and stays there nice to know that we had nearly 0 refugees from the balkans in the 90s then . 
  there are about 200 countries in total , i do n't think their version of democracy is in the top 20 ... 
  because it is f * in ' illegal . 
  banks are sometimes hilariously insecure , yet i 'm definitely not going to go to jail to prove a point . 
  no , i mean https://media.ccc.de/v/31c3_-_6344_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412281400_-_security_analysis_of_estonia_s_internet_voting_system_-_j_alex_halderman i am against e-voting , not e-government . 
  because it is now possible to be understood by a non-expert how it works . 
  it is trivial to explain paper ballot voting , electronic voting is totally dependant on experts and arcane processes . 
  additionally apparently there are no external audits of that system and as it was criticised in the past this was met with `` russian propaganda '' claims instead of improving the process . 
  yes to all of the mentioned e-gov things by the way . 
  including stupidities like voting ... anyways , compared to austria you do n't have much more to offer service wise for example and if i want to incorporate abroad , it is probably cheaper to pay someone to do it for me than hoping that estonian law stays business friendly . 
  you want a third one ? 
  which is the wrong approach for national defense . 
  probably the right one for offense though ... 
  for the latest `` wave '' : in masses during the 2015 autumn , more individually i know some personally too . 
  mostly good experiences . 
  thinking back i 'm sure there were some refugee kids from the balkan wars among us when i was in school ... do n't remember much , after all they were just kids . 
  still sounds like a marketing gag to me , all you get is a plastic card to authenticate yourself to use e-government services . 
  to actually answer the question : if you graduate it should n't be much of a problem to get a work visa afterwards . 
  if you drop out of university after just 1 year , you 'd need to leave the schengen area , not the eu . 
  tourist visa are for 90 days out of 180 days in a year ( !, 
  ) , so you will have to schedule additional ~ 180 days back home . 
  this is anyways needed since otherwise it will be harder to get a visa again as your center of life seems to have shifted elsewhere which is a red flag . 
  i would not recommend working illegally . 
  especially not in germany . 
  for these types of questions and discussions , voat was created . 
  please go and stay there . 
  yeah , and have money for language lessons ( or that there even are lots of them to teach in the first place ... ) . 
  i strongly disagree and apparently a majority of voters did so too . 
  in your mind maybe , but this would lead to very `` special '' people to join this army . 
  i do n't want a situation like in the us where the military is taking over the role of health care and social services . 
  first of all conscription is not military service . 
  secondly `` doing fine '' is relative . 
  many are/were involved in nato attack wars abroad for example . 
  well , he suggests that he 'll earn money teaching english to syrians . 
  in what way ? 
  legally there never was a crisis called by anyone ( not even right wing parties ) because that would have meant that the crisis funds would have been made available ... 
  ... not according to our constitution . 
  i would only support an eu army that has mandatory military service in every member state to ensure it consists of a broad spectrum of members instead of only warmongers and gun nuts . 
  then you are not deported as you enter but a few months later . 
  could you maybe give a concrete case where this should have been possible ? 
  but the army is not voluntary !, 
  maybe she perceives more fat and sugar as high quality because it is sweeter for example ? 
  it is also not objectively measurable . 
  the `` northern bro '' apparently reaches further north than expected ... at least they speak a germanic language there . 
  none of these are criteria for asking for or getting asylum ... 
  i like that it has an actual scope , beyond that i have no assault rifles to compare it to , so i guess it 's kinda ok . at least it 's not very heavy , most of the time you 're carrying that thing around instead of shooting anyways . 
  looks a bit flimsy ... 
  says the one with `` styria '' as a region ... :-p, 
  chimneys look a bit weird for vienna , but could be that they were that way back in the 70s . 
  did anyone really believe that ? 
  roman ? 
  no ... think a few thousand years back . 
  yes, 
  but why not `` concentration tank '' ?
