  the austrian guy thinks : at the next tunnel i 'll slap him again !, 
  the issues being people walking on the motorway and endangering themselves ... 
   which i assume is the official webpage for election dates in no way it is , luckily we know who owns it , since websites have to show an imprint : http://www.wahltermin.at/impressum.html this shows they are owned by http://www.wien-konkret.at/k/impressum/ which states : `` politik : der herausgeber mag . 
  robert marschall hat am 15 . 
  [ ... ] '' ( politics : the publisher mag . 
  robert marschall has founded with 2 aquaintances the `` leave the eu '' party on sep. 15 . 
  2011 and is now the head of that party . 
  also robert marschall was the top candidate of `` eu-stop '' at the eu election 2014 . 
   in any case , the eu should have an army , a foreign policy . 
  no , definitely not . 
  this is against the austrian constitution for example . 
  go begging a bit or beat up a gypsy , depending on you being roma or romanian . 
  maybe it is connected with being out of romania for more than a decade ... 
  yeah , they steal their wallets first ... / s, 
  he 'd probably like to , i doubt he 'll manage to get a coalition though . 
  throwing up ( which is a bit of euphemism in itself ) : `` aufajausnen '' ( engl . 
  `` snacking upwards '' ) alternative names for a big fast food chain : `` ye golden seagull '' ( `` zur g\u00fcldenen m\u00f6we '' ) and `` the cardboard box inn '' ( `` schachtelwirt '' ) business speek is full of euphemisms by the way , there are no problems , only improvement areas , no shitty stuff , only suboptimal things ... also politics : `` the assad regime '' vs. `` the assad administration '' or `` the assad dictatorship '', 
  we had a specific subculture ( that died out rather quickly ) called `` krocha '' ( german `` kracher '' , english `` crackers '' ) , feel free to delight yourself in youtube results . 
  other than that , a more general term might be `` prolo '' , `` prolet '' ( male ) or `` prolotussi '' ( fem . ), 
  but that again has a slightly different connotation than your `` chav '' stereotype ( more focussed on cars - vw golf gtis for example - or hooking up with the ladies in clubs , not so much connected to lower class ) . 
   twenty two times more likely to be detained as crime suspects vs.  twice as likely to commit a crime so you detain massive amounts of moroccans that are not criminal at all ? 
  only ~ 10 % of the ones you lock up are actually criminals ... 
  this is in inches , right ? 
  from 20th century history , austrofascism is rarely a topic and mostly jumped over - something like `` yeah , there were a few years between wwi and wwii where economy was down etc. 
  - let 's learn about nazis now '' . 
  most likely not intentionally , after all it was just ~ 4 years , but it is a really interesting read , especially since the names of the parties involved as well as the areas are more familiar . 
  i 've seen more women with burkas in munich than in morocco ... so i doubt that it is just a pure religious issue . 
  probably for a while they just were overlooked , now it would be bad press to just ~ ~ annex ~ ~ re-integrate them . 
  they make themselves important by offering money laundering and tax evasion services ( paypal and amazon amongst others are based in luxembourg with their eu branches ), 
  to get the percentage of argo subsidies down , i 'd rather increase the overall eu budget while keeping the agro budget constant . 
  for electronics ( and by now even more ) there 's https://geizhals.at for example . 
  i 'm quite sure there are other meta search engines out there for other product categories . 
  turks were migrants , not refugees . 
  sure , but bludenz is the closest production to switzerland , they do n't produce there any more : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milka#production_locations, 
  not truly traditional ( only maybe in the traditional style of a `` wienerlied '' [ viennese song ] ) , but it expresses the austrian spirit quite well : eav - leckt 's mi do am oasch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbljx1p9i3a, 
   switzerland due to their milka chocolate well , that one is produced in austria too ( since over a century ) - in bludenz , vorarlberg : https://www.milka.at/marke/lila_laedele, 
  http://www.zotter.at/ for chocolate and https://www.steyr-mannlicher.com/ or http://www.glock.com/ for guns . 
  while they might welcome immigration , they do n't like change ... ;-), 
  they are afraid of the kangaroos and the ghost of steve irvin that is probably still haunting the austrian continent ... 
  you really think that the money sent for helping refugee camps would be used for that by erdogan ? 
  oh look , a russian is judging us !, 
  at least in austria a lot of ( migrated ) serbs are living and voting , it is easier to piss off the few africans or show some desert land compared to austria than explaining that the economic migrants are serbs trying to get social benefits . 
  having a 0 for the best score is kinda weird , but still thanks for the compliment ... ;-), 
  nope , dublin iii makes it easier for non-border countries to send refugees back to the country where someone entered and was first registered . 
  if germany chooses to ignore it ( which is even allowed explicitly ) they mostly hurt themselves . 
  i doubt that hungary/italy/greece / spain are now suddenly demanding to get a few 1000 refugees back to add to their camps ... 
  we have no minimum wage in austria ... 
  nope 2 . 
  we double dare you !, 
  start with ramstein air base !, 
  then your family would die . 
  after all , gordon freeman worked there ( or rather will work there in the future ) . 
   do you think , common syrian refugee has around approx . 
  5000 and more eur per head for the trip ? 
  do you think average syrian refugee would try such long and costly trip ? 
  how much money would your family be able to come up with , if the alternative would be that you are being sent as an untrained soldier to the front lines ? 
  would you go to an ( overfilled ) neighbouring country ? 
  refugee ! = migrant ... 
  i 'm sure in prisons there are more soaps on the floor after showers than before . 
  feel free to publish it here then and find out !, 
  we need to make working in politics and the public sector more attractive to the generation y and millennials : ius primae noctis goes into full effect eu wide !, 
  who would negotiate and harmonize these salaries ? 
  there is not enough of that kind of labor any more , most of it can be done by skilled workers with machines much faster and better . 
  on a scale from ankle length to borat specifically ... 
  irish is also quite different . 
  on the other hand it is relatively easy for me to speak in a dialect that will leave people guessing if that 's even a language or which one it might be . 
  probably provided by their employer ... 
  the f1 hybrid , hm ? 
  not a germanic language ? 
  --  eastern europe it is !, 
  just look at hiroshima and nagasaki ... people are able to rationalize almost any atrocity . 
  with foreigners ? 
  probably yes . 
  if drunk and/or amongst each other ? 
  probably no . 
  they fall in value constantly anyways , so all you need to do is wait a little more until prices catch up . 
  so they bought a croatian flag , polluted their air and put themselves in danger just to make a statement ? 
  does n't seem like a very sustainable way of protest to me ... 
  many europeans emigrated to argentina in the last century . 
  that 's reserved for family , sorry . 
  if austrians wan na go freaky , they climb on mountains ... 
  i do n't really like to read them but they keep the subreddit 's spam rate down , so for me personally a net positive . 
  so why switch to austrian mode ?!, 
  a heavy storm that is apparently destroying his hut ( `` hittn - h\u00fctte '' ) and everything . 
  when going inside the wife ( apparently quite on the edge herself ) asks him `` which hut ?! '', 
  when he announces that the whole hut was torn apart . 
  mostly funny because of the ( carinthian ) accent i guess . 
  28 by now , so if you are into audio books like me , go to audible.com/blackfire to get a free audiobook !, 
  again , that 's audible.com/blackfire . 
  thanks for supporting this positing and now let 's continue with the thread ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xebhjbdfl1g definitely went viral in austria a while back and has currently ~ 151k views only ... 
  asking all the right questions , hm ? 
  as far as i understand the story , hematophagian was making a sexy/sexist comment assuming nobody would understand it anyways - but failed . 
  should have turned to them and said `` they also understand lithuanian ! '', 
  - then run off as fast as possible . 
  ... and `` ch ch ch '' choking sounds . 
  i understand swiss german ~ 80 % if i focus on it . 
  will be interesting this summer , as i go to a country that is typically full of us-americans ... 
  otherwise most people already assume that there are english speakers around . 
  where i did n't need to be bilingual but was overhearing something stupid was in ~ ~ reval ~ ~ talinn in 2014 when a german man said to someone : `` meh , this place is so touristic , they even have all prices in euros !,
