  at least it gives the newspapers something to write about i guess . 
  it is not clear how this should be enforced , geoip blocking/filtering is stupid anyways ( and i would not recommend using any of these plugins without a lot of prior research : you are basically mitming your connection with a vpn ! ) . 
  it just means that you can drag any online retailer of ebooks that wants to legitimately operate in germany ( not a small market ... ) to court if they do n't comply if you are also in the business . 
  why not ? 
  all of germany is in one time zone and if they do n't care about foreign kids being able to buy books during the day , it seems relatively easy to implement and check for . 
  anything you can put on a grill is popular in summer ... too early for midsummer , but stealing corn cobs from a field and roasting them on a bonfire is also popular . 
  i 'm 99 % sure i can speak german in a way that danes wo n't even know the subject ... 
  430 people dies in traffic last year in austria , so 3 people is slightly above average for a weekend . 
  only 75 pedestrians though , so no , your comparison does n't really hold . 
   why would n't the price for intact city walls from hundreds of years ago be at least 16 euro ? 
  because other cities also do n't charge that much ... 
  have you actually tried that or are you just guessing ? 
   seriously ?? 
  time to invest . 
  good luck with getting even your name into the official registry ( if one exists in that area ) . 
  http://www.ktimatologio.gr it is going to be quite hard to enforce your ownership of that property ... 
   additionally , taxation is lower over here . 
  quality of life too ... 
  they should have privatized the food safety labs , then there would n't be any problems !, 
  a few people get sick , nobody buys contaminated meat any more , producers have to take care about clean , fresh meat . 
  free market in full action . 
  this is just making the process more inefficient and slowing down progress through red tape and regulations ... edit , just to make sure : / s, 
  but dad is beating mommy up , so she does n't really say or do anything . 
  http://freakonomics.com/2014/10/16/how-can-tiny-norway-afford-to-buy-so-many-teslas-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/ you do n't have salaries anywhere close to most other european countries though and a tesla would have much fewer benefits in austria ( no seperate bus lanes to drive on for example ) . 
  because you subsidize them with your oil fund to a point where it makes no sense to not buy one . 
  ~ 100 km range ... how about no . 
  i know that this is more useful for commutes etc. , but if i buy a car , i want to be able to go on holiday with it as well . 
  yeah , or fighting off these native americans overseas that were looking so threatening ... / s, 
  i meant also in the sense of `` traditional '' . 
  it mostly depends on if you are `` an indian in america '' or `` an american from india '' i guess as well as what you view as superior culture . 
  your personal viewpoint can range from `` land of personal freedom '' to `` country full of heretics '' when you look at random people on the street on a nice sunny day . 
  you are talking about 2 different groups of people that are being killed by flying robots . 
  i am suggesting that people from both groups are potentially being affected . 
  also your initial statement only talks about `` muslims '' , not about `` non-violent muslims '' ( being a member of a religion has nothing to do with being a good/bad person in general ) . 
  peope tend to get more conservative when they are abroad . 
  imagine it like this : in some muslim-majority countries , alcohol is seen as really bad thing , so if you drink alcohol there , you do it to get drunk . 
  there is no way that you 'd just drink a single beer with your lunch because you like the taste of it . 
  similar with headwear of muslim girls in non-muslim countries ( one of the less controversial parts of sharia `` law '' ) : there is no way that you 'd partially show your hair because it 's the latest fashion or whatever - the act of wearing something over your hair alone is a statement in itself , so you might as well do it `` properly '' . 
   i 'd say the ball is pretty much in your court because i am yet to hear of an european organizing and delivering terror attacks on muslim soil against muslims . 
  i 'm pretty sure there are also europeans directly or indirectly involved in various drone strikes around the world . 
  ... guy ? 
  these are 15 year old girls ... also how should beating up a driver help the ones on the floor ? 
  he lived in vienna for a long time . 
  maybe should n't have annexed then especially with a referendum coming up anyways . 
  `` britain '' ... yeah ... 
  [ graz , austria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graz ) : http://diebausatzlokale.at/ - if you ever want a nice meal for ~ 10 $ , go to `` area 5 '' at jakominiplatz on a nice sunny day and hope that a table is free ( or wait for 15 minutes or so at the bar ) . 
  amazing view , they also serve cocktails . 
  if you want austrian food in the ~ 15-20 $ per meal range , go to http://www.gloecklbraeu.at/nc/home.html ( center ) or http://goesserbraeugraz.at/ ( slightly out of the center ) . 
  http://www.dersteirer.at/ is also recommendable and would likely best fit your requirements ( 20-25 $ , great and typical food ) . 
  more expensive : http://www.elgaucho.at/graz/home.html for steaks ( you 'll stretch your 25 $ budget quite a bit there , it will probably only be enough for the meat ) . 
  you only need body cams , not cctv to catch a cop killing people . 
  the policeman does not store everything she/he sees for eternity for later analysis . 
  judging from interrail prices , about 30-50 $ per day , depending on discounts . 
  only number 5 ? 
  we 're now posting neonazi salutes ? 
  go to the zoo . 
  sorry , it was in the beginning of the 80s : http://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bundesregierung_sinowatz so every 20 years it seems that they manage to get into the government . 
  it is hard to be more expensive than animal tests ... 
  `` once '' in the 70s , then in the 2000s and probably in the 2010s or 20s again if the government still messes up that badly ( as expected ) . 
  today that 's called `` socialism '' or `` terrorism '' in the us apparently . 
   both me and obraka left for the same reason . 
  and i think you can guess why . 
  please do n't play the guessing game or make us search through post histories etc. 
  no , i 'm thinking about people abroad who have citizenship , regardless of their own intentions . 
  apparently / u/obraka is not a mod any more too ? 
  they are probably being punished for not preventing this ... 
  citizenship by blood means that someone who was born in austria and never was in turkey can still vote . 
  imagine all these `` irish '' us-americans being allowed to vote in ireland ... 
  meh , most `` turks '' around here are kurds anyways , they wo n't care about turkey anyways until kurdistan gets ( re ) created . 
  what 's the current legal interpretation in the uk of the word `` militant '' ? 
   with the naked eye then it will pop out of your head most likely before you can make out anything useful ... :-p, 
  '' \u00dcbermorgen '' in german ( a quite literal translation of `` overmorrow '' ), 
  german : schenkelspreizer, 
  we have our standards !, 
  go on google maps , most likely your house is visible from space too ... 
   i wonder how many people watch this thinking it 's like john oliver and do n't realise that the words people are saying have been changed for comedic purposes ? 
  probably only people that watch this ( pirated and illegally distributed ! ), 
  version on youtube . 
  i found the blind greek !, 
  make sure to stock up on tungsten : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tungsten#gold_substitution, 
  i 'd rather have a cap ( or at least mental health test ) for the upper limits than discussing young voters . 
  our society gets older and older , people with dementia are a bigger problem than 2 years worth of kids . 
  the aroused `` l '' ... 
  freakin ' communists , all of them !, 
  ~ 4 years back a 250 kg bomb had to be detonated in graz , austria right next to the main station . 
  congratulations to the germans on being able to defuse theirs ( most of the ones around here get defused too , this one had a time delay and was in relatively good shape so the ignition could n't be separated to defuse it ) . 
  about 750k eur in damages , a few 1000 people relocated temporally and some splinters managed to fly about a kilometer through the air . 
  this is graz , austria ... 
  i doubt there is a `` graz '' in switzerland as the name has slavic origins . 
  definitely come and visit - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/styrian_armoury ( the german wiki page is better , but ... well ... german ) graz has a lot more to offer too , like a really nice city center with an awesome hill ( without a fortress since the 1809 when napoleon demanded it to be torn down to sign a peace treaty , otherwise graz would look a bit similar to salzburg who still has its fortress ) in the city center and great views as well as cool things to do on the countryside . 
  for example you can visit stuff ranging from a chocolate factory ( http://www.zotter.at/en/ ) , an open air museum with houses from all over austria ( http://www.freilichtmuseum.at/en/ ) , go hiking in an awesome gorge ( http://www.baerenschuetzklamm.at ) to just visiting the city ( which will also take 1-2 days , depending on what you are interested in and how much you want to see ) edit : there are direct connections to/from venice to graz and if you book in advance , the tickets are quite cheap ( or you just use interrail ), 
  ca n't tell without context if you 're russian or from the us ... 
  from austria/vienna of course ( who got the idea from eastern europe : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kolatsche#die_.c3.b6sterreichische_kolatsche ) . 
  it is just a synonym for a kolatsche . 
  `` get to da choppa !, 
  '' , not `` roll to da choppa ! '', 
  yeah , but you tip obscene amounts , subsidizing wages and cutting down the need to earn money with beverages . 
  that being said , tap water usually is also free here or you might be charged something like 50 cents if you only drink water and leave without consuming anything else . 
  we do n't have `` d\u00e4nenbrot '' here . 
  you however ...
