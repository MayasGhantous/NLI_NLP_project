  do n't they have something better to do down there than standing around on streets ? 
  the one without the eagle is the official flag , the one with the coat of arms is the http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/dienstflagge_des_bundes, 
  `` great '' use of air quotes . 
  oh , the `` benefit '' of not being in the euro zone . 
   my bank offers deposits with interest rates up to 4 % over inflation . 
  cyprus 2.0 incoming then ... 
   they give credits and invest the money . 
  what 's wrong with that ? 
  you typically ca n't choose into whom/what they invest and also they are allowed to inflate these amounts and operate on fractional reserve . 
  the interest is laughable and wo n't cover inflation , so you 're essentially paying for storing your money with them so they can profit from it . 
   says the person who did not check thr prices of maestro transactions in austria i suppose . 
  maestro is dirt cheap . 
  source ? 
  https://www.paylife.at/web/content/de/vertragspartner/terminals_angebote/index.html does n't quote pricing ... 
  is is not created by consumer banks either and the debt is not in cash ... 
   as i 'm working at a bank that no longer handles cash is your local currency not legal tender ?!, 
  how can you able to refuse payments in your local currency ( which is only cash ) ? 
  credit/debit cards , bitcoin or paypal , in that order . 
  also i do n't order stuff that costs about as much as a car in one single order from one single random guy on the web typically . 
  buying from webstores is also different than buying from the local craigslist equivalent . 
   i do not need any licence , besides bank account . 
  you do have the right to own + transact money , you have no right to have a bank account . 
  also i do n't want to support the kind of stuff that banks do with the deposited money ( no , it does not just sint in a box in their basement and no , it is not used to suport local business with credit ) . 
   growing pains in digital banking systems also seem to be all but a thing of the past ... nope ( http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/34x04h/do_you_really_want_bank_grade_security_in_your/ ) and since banks do n't really see transaction processing as their core business anyways , i doubt that this will change in the future . 
  i doubt that there are many non-english speakers that travel far beyond their language region ... the overlap between english speakers and people going for random travels ( might be different for organized holidays like going to an all-inclusive club ) is probably very high . 
  other than that ( e.g. 
  you are abroad and speak english , but your other party does n't ) , you either find someone close by who can translate , switch to `` waving hands + pointing at things '' to communicate or prepare better ( e.g. 
  get a map + check out where you are going to sleep before starting your travels ) . 
  yes . 
  say what ?!, 
  their friggin name for their country is `` slovensko republika '' ... 
  can be the same , can be a different one . 
  you do n't need to be super rich to have a basement that can house a whole family . 
  which attack again ? 
  there was none ( ! ), 
  and whatever might have happened was averted because you have to sign papers to buy h2o2 at concentrations that are higher than 12 % . 
  the seller at the store got suspicions and called the police to investigate . 
  i believe that routine stuff like that would be filed away quickly in other times . 
  because it was someone with foreign and muslim sounding names , it suddenly gets communicated as if these were the new una bombers and they bought a medium sized nuclear war head in the super market . 
  there was no terrorist attack - also i do n't believe that , so i wo n't say that explicitly . 
  german/turkish double citizenship ... try harder . 
  it is just weird to mention something that someone did who must be over 90 by now in that way . 
  i hear worse stull all the time , no worries . 
  i guess so , personally i like both the norwegian model ( military service for both men and women ) as well as the swedish one ( no military service , but when abolishing it , make sure that in the event of an invasion/emergency , both men and women are drafted ) , depending on the stance on military service . 
  bnd helped the nsa and the government knew about it , this is outrageous , one really should ... oh look here , we have terrorists !, 
  time for vorratsdatenspeicherung !, 
  that 's something that a lot of people do n't seem to understand : it is the government 's task to make decisions and to rule , not to just check out what the majority might want at the moment and constantly hold popular votes . 
  not that i like that particularly either , but it makes no sense to complain about the fact that a government does what its mandate is : decide . 
  if you want to complain , please rather complain about the decisions taken . 
   when you guys came to `` visit '' norway in 1940 [ ... ] srsly ?!, 
   you do n't think germany 2015 would do the same if it needed to ? 
  i highly doubt it , there are probably more men between 18 and 50 in germany than norwegians in total , no matter the age . 
  also looking at how wars are conducted in this century it would be probably even hard to convince your own country that there is a war going on . 
  : is there a war right now in irak , in gaza and in the ukraine ? 
  depending on who you ask , the answers differ quite a bit . 
  nearly every country has conscription , only few have mandatory military service though . 
  military service = you have to spend a few months in the military conscription = if the country decides , certain citizens have to join the military . 
  in most cases , this only concerns men between ~ 18 and ~ 45 years exclusively . 
   no conscription in germany wrong : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wehrpflicht_in_deutschland#wehrpflichtigkeit - if the country has to be defended , only males can be forced to join the military . 
  america is n't a country either ... 
  well , time to speak it then ... 
  lots of typos in there ... 
   look at the sharp rise of xenophobia in austria got sources for that ? 
  in austria in 2009 students called for a boycott and apparently were partly successful ... 
  check out the game `` papers please '' ... 
  i thought you 'd post [ cheloo - contra cronometru ( feat . 
  texta ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fecegvkubbk ) - i did a transcript + translation recently : http://www.reddit.com/r/austria/comments/2zh51b/can_someone_help_me_with_the_translation_of_this/cpj3p5n, 
  well , there are lyrics available , i guess that would make it easier ... 
  one of the rare carinthian dialect rap songs : [ digga mindz - punchlinez feat . 
  jack untawega & kayo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpzbuwynmag ) from upper austria , about having a party in a changing room in summer : [ skero feat . 
  joyce muniz - kabinenparty ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i-i6ymx23g ) not so much dialect but the song tries to give proof that the city of sound of music is austria 's secret ghetto ( ?!, 
  txm ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=je_fu4c1u9u ) something actually good from salzburg : [ demolux feat . 
  t-ser - m\u00fcllm\u00e4nner ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phzvvg8xru4 ) `` typical '' viennese ... not really rap though : [ die vamummtn - ana geht no ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=purfueqpbiq ) falco also had a few rare early techno tracks by the way - would be really cool to see some more recent artists also give different genres a try : [ falco - mutter der mann mit dem koks ist da ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m7bhdcq87o ), 
  how is this austrian german ? 
  but yeah , at least an austrian artist . 
  german has lots more as well , this map supposedly only shows the most popular ones . 
  ... and now with absolute numbers . 
  except for the voting folly , which fortunately is n't done in austria so far , you can do all of this with our digital signature card/health id too ( signing/encrypting code , documents , mail ... as well as banking , taxes and other services ) . 
  i already have this for years in my country : https://www.buergerkarte.at/, 
   no black boxes for us . 
  ... but running windows boxes in the system and counting the votes on commodity hardware . 
   go vote on paper , it will void the online vote . 
  prevent the voter from voting by paper ( e.g. 
  in a retirement home ) and make sure they submit `` your '' vote very close to the deadline online , then take away their id cards . 
  well , your op started with a list ... 
  that 's a common myth : http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsautobahn#mythen_und_motive, 
  yeah , landed on my list of shame too !, 
  the nature consists of mostly rocks ... and all on all you are locked on a small island , i doubt that there is fast internet as well . 
  hopefully you at least complained afterwards officially ... 
  well , apparently there are idiots everywhere ... 
  if anyone tried to pull off stunts like this in austria ( where i had my military service including a 6 week deployment as border guard - so i have spent lots of nights outside , also in towers ) there would be complaints quite quickly and whoever was responsible would face serious problems . 
  have you actually been to the military in estonia and were on guard duty or are you just assuming ? 
   every hungarian citizen 's duty i bet it 's only the male citizens ... 
  you can take things that are called `` books '' and `` read '' them in these towers ... also it is just a job , not a prison - there 's plenty of free time to do whatever you want . 
  that 's my point - people are used to the idea `` if they sell groceries , they must be good - why else would they sell them ? '' . 
  then in the us , they enter any random large store , marvel at the 50 different brands of corn flakes or whatever and then buy stuff that looks fairly reasonable priced and similar to back home - and then start wondering how anyone could ever eat stuff like that . 
  there 's a reason walmart never managed to catch on in the european market and it is not socialists ... 
  austria , the whole country and new york state ( since i did n't find statistics for nyc quickly ) . 
  the whole country has no `` horrible neighbourhoods '' and as you said it is not impossible at all for someone from ny to witness a shooting if coming from such neighbourhoods . 
  itt : astroturfing or maybe just butthurt `` americans '' trying to play down issues and offering anecdotal evidence .
