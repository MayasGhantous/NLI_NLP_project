  yeah , i live on the border . 
  they now blocked the bridge to germany . 
  today you could still pass with just your driver license , which is nice . 
  well , they had rifles for sure and did n't look like some normal police guys , but maybe they were indeed just police . 
  had no idea that the army being there would be something huge so i just assumed it was them . 
  there also was german army guys doing the border checks this morning . 
  i do n't know why you are assuming that i work against you , or that i will insult you , but in my ( personal ) opinion i find it rascist to turn refugees down because of their race , more did i not say . 
  regarding the other point , women and children die quicker than young men and while those traffickers do n't care about their lives , living people are easier to hide . 
  dead bodies start to smell and in general is a truck full of dead bodies going to attract more attention ( and police investigations ) than a truck full of living refugees . 
  it 's the biggest flood of immigrants , however if distributed across the eu it 's really not that problematic . 
  europe survived far worse than a wave of muslim immigrants and even if our standard of living will be influenced by this and we do n't know what problems may arise , i still think we as a society can absolutely handle that . 
  well , turning down refugees because of their race is ... racist . 
  and most of them are young men because human traffickers ( ? ), 
  take only them because they are the strongest . 
  women and children apparently cost way more to get out of the country that way so the families get their sons out first so they can eventually get enough money to pay for their wife/children/mother to come also . 
  source : my mother works with refugees and guides them through the asylum process so i talked to quite a few refugees ( mostly from syria ), 
  they plan to switch tho . 
  i am austrian and my mothers job is actually to guide people seeking for asylum through the bureaucracy . 
  it 's actually a long process and there are certain checks , however it is just not possible to do a proper background check for people coming from somalia for example ( there are medical checks tho ) . 
  there often are just no former workplaces or even government institutions to contact . 
  it sucks for you but we ca n't send them back if that could mean their deaths . 
  and most of them are not criminal at all or even terrorists . 
  the higher crime rate is a problem but we can not know if someone is a criminal before he commits a crime and ca n't deny asylum just because he might become a criminal , that 's insane . 
  and terrorism is not a problem here really but a buzzword getting thrown around by populist politicians . 
  the most serious terrorist act committed in austria since 9/11 has been an austrian hunter going crazy and killing police and medics . 
  we do not welcome these people `` with open arms '' , but with a humanity that should be expected . 
  also , at least in austria , there is a lot of racism `` welcoming '' them among the population . 
  i know people who in response to the refugees complaining about the quality of the provided food argued we should just open up the concentration camps again , a statement which truly shocked me , but a lot of people would silently approve or laugh it of as some silly joke . 
  the thing is that we ca n't send them back because they could very likely be killed if we send them back into the crisis they fled from . 
  is that always the case with them ? 
  no , but you ca n't know for sure and background-check everyone that would be insane . 
  helping these people is just an human thing . 
  you on the other hand came from the usa , there is no war in your country and you are not getting hunted for political reasons so you got ta do the normal process of immigrating for non-refugees . 
  i seriously doubt that you would want to switch with an refugee from afghanistan just to skip that bureaucratic stuff . 
  read the article ... 
  it 's a higher school so they should have 6 periods, 
  yeah , sorry for that . 
  it just completely fucked my lunchbreak . 
  apperantly the students of the school next door also decided that right now would be the best time to buy their lunch even tough they should actually still have class at 12 ? 
  we sometimes do and it 's mainly the cheaper beer and cosmetics but driving through simbach is incredibly annoying and taking the longer way around the town feels wrong so most people i know do n't do it regularly . 
  the germans coming to austria outweigh austrians crossing to germany by far , the most annoying thing are our gas stations at the weekend . 
  and we even get 3 stationary radars soon ( i hope to god they are not active yet ) . 
  our police can be quite some dicks really , we have a small 30 zone next to a school ( htl ) where they love to stand around in the middle of the night to get some easy money of people thinking that the 30 zone is to protect the students and not to make money , so they go through it with 50 at 2 am . 
  russia is culturally and historically an european nation and the vast majority of russians live in europe . 
  of course you * could * argue but it does n't change the truth . 
  yep , that 's my town ^ ^ * . . wappler *, 
  also one part of austria ( vorarlberg ) asked to join switzerland but was not accepted and another part ( carinthia , but not sure if it was about the all carinthia ) held a referendum on wether to join jugoslavia or not ( they decided against ), 
  as an austrian living on the border to germany i feel you . 
  whole town is full of germans shopping , ca n't even find a single parking space , fucking shit, 
   accidentally murdering someone on the street tfw, 
  it 's really just short for ** tschech ** oslovak ** ei **, 
  i doubt mozart was more succesful than falco when it comes to sales . 
  well , proposing the unification of austria and germany is actually illegal , so yeah, 
  wtf is wrong with reddit, 
  i would if i could :( love you sunny balkan bros < 3, 
  i got told by a serb friend that she ca n't understand russian at all because it 's `` a completely different language '' and my belarussian friend says she can understand serbo-croatian easily . 
  `` it 's practically the same . '', 
  e : and then theres the guy on your cs : go server that tells you `` it 's actually croatian . '', 
  if you tell him that you do n't speak serbian . 
  inb4 hungarians speak broken german, 
  yeah , we are , but that 's again just the result of a healthier diet , and healthier lifestyle . 
  i get where you 're coming from ( though i disagree about the `` decades '' part ) but from what i learned in school `` evolution '' takes much longer to take effect . 
  but i kinda know what you mean , just that `` evolve '' kinda sounds like you are talking about `` evolution '' and that 's not what is happening here afaik . 
  not really because anyone evolves , more like hygiene standards got higher and people are much healthier now . 
  for humans to evolve it would take much more time . 
  hehe , 
  and in austrian german it literally means `` dumb '', 
  just mountain is fine, 
   and i 'd argue that doing a nazi salute does not make you a nazi . 
  only a fucking idiot if you 're doing it in germany . 
    the yank most likely thought it would be fun to do the nazi salute in germany . 
  if you 're commiting a crime because you 're an idiot you are still commiting a crime even if you do n't know any better . 
    so punching someone doing a hitler salute is not any different than punching a robber . 
    i 'd argue that there is a massive difference . 
  a robber has the potential to harm you . 
  an idiot doing a nazi salute does not . 
  criminal is criminal . 
  if the thing you believe in is outlawed then it just might be that you deserve some punches , the same as a robber or a thief deserves it . 
  it 's not a political thing though . 
  in germany being a nazi is outlawed , so punching someone doing a hitler salute is not any different than punching a robber . 
  we have a saying : `` fascism is no opinion but a crime '', 
   fascism is a type of government that espouses radical right-wing social values ( hyper nationalism , etc. ), 
  combined with left wing economic policies . 
    last time i checked , turkey is n't and most likely wo n't become an economically socialist country complete bullshit . 
  nazi germany in no way embraced socialist economic values just as much as north korea embraces democratic values . 
  neither did fascist austria . 
  the only reason they called the party `` national socialist '' was to attract the workers . 
  in austria , yeah . 
  as long as you 're 16 you 're free to go for a smoke if you got a long enough break . 
  you say it sounds ridiculous but every school i know has a designated smoker spot . 
  maybe it 's just austria being the chimney of europe, 
  and do n't forget the girls !, 
  well , we 're social democracy , no one was unsure about that , and i love it . 
  we were just wondering how to express it if you 'd want less of that `` social '' stuff , because the democracy stuff is widely agreed to be super . 
  oh , i think i get it . 
  socialism sounds definitely a bit wrong , but i do n't know how to say it either . 
  lol , how is socialism `` popular '' in austria, 
  i actually like `` sie '' . 
  it 's an easy way to show respect in a formal environment . 
  and if everyone is comfortable with `` du '' it 's offered from the get-go anyway .
