  especially if i 'd talk to some higher up in my company `` du '' would feel really weird . 
  it 's sometimes also helpful . 
  like if i i 'd see a group of people talking and listen into their conversation i can tell who 's the boss . 
  north german/scandinavian, 
  i think slovakia is implied with czechia ... , 
  `` ein echter wiener geht nicht unter '' and i 'm also a big fan of josef hader and his movies, 
  no , just a stone ( either from auschwitz or mauthausen ) in front of it saying `` never again fascism . 
  millions of dead remind us . '', 
  the house hitler was born in . 
  it 's just an ordinary house like every other house in town . 
  eh , could be worse . 
  we have some good cabaret , i especially like josef hader who also stared in some pretty good movies . 
  there 's some weak shit on tv around fasching and i 'm not too fond of our `` kaiser '' ( a show around the concept of the emperor of austria talking with prominent people ) but we got some funny stuff . 
  yeah , my town of 15k souls actually got quite a neo-nazi scene a few years ago , mostly teenagers and guys in their young 20s . 
  as these were the guys you grew up with you sometimes talked with them and if you were on the other side of the political spectrum you did n't talk nicely xd they kinda vanished after the guy who kind of held them together died in a car crash , some dropped the bomber jackets and grew some hair but still identify with the right-wing , some went to jail . 
  some grew up . 
  lol . 
  never heard that . 
  i have no idea what you 're talking about but it sounds a bit offensive ? 
  yeah , morgen . 
  apperantly it 's how much land a farmer can work in one `` jutro '' , so it 's really variable and depends on the farmer : ~ ), 
  yeah , might be . 
  it 's gotten more tourist-y over the years . 
  last time i was there i was kinda shocked to see that they turned that old castle into a jazzbar kind of thing ( though it 's quite nice ) and you could buy beer at the beach ( srbrna ? 
   glad you liked it . 
  i have a house in a small seaside village on vis . 
  during the summer months its literally heaven on earth . 
  which is true for the whole of mediterranean . 
  the islands , the seemingly arid climate , the flora ... 
  when i was a child we regulary went to vis , an island you can reach by ferry from split , and i have some real nostalgia about that . 
  i absolutely love that long tunnel on the highway zagreb-split ( i think ) that takes you from rainy i-hate-this-drive-i 'm - cold-climate to wow-that 's - nice-climate ( the stops near the highway were still extremely windy tho ) . 
  from austria that drive took like 10 hours but always worth it .

  ye french and slavic accents are hot, 
  if you 're in bratislava already i would think about visiting vienna too . 
  sorry if i sounded harsh , i 've just seen this argued so much on reddit by people who actually try to argue it . 
  a big part of russia is located in asia ( = siberia , the asian part of russia ) but the country itself an european one . 
  you got ta see siberia more as a `` colony '' of russia ( it 's not an actual colony thats wrong so do n't quote me on that ) and the part west of the ural as the actual russia in which most russians live . 
  ( this is really simplified ) . 
  why should n't it be ? 
  russia is culturally and historically a part of europe . 
  slavs are an european ethnicity , russia is culturally much closer to western europe than asia and russia 's history is closely tied to the history of whole europe . 
  there is literally no argument that supports russia being an asian country other than siberia being in asia . 
  keep in mind that the vast majority of russians do n't live in siberia . 
  dota 2, 
  you speak garlic ? 
  or whole country feels like a meme sometimes, 
  maybe dollfu\u00df as he was a fascist , but then again he opposed hitler ( but then again he was allied to mussolini ), 
  i think most of our emperors are either well remembered or forgotten . 
  no , not at all really, 
  i mean , there * were * some fucked up roman emperors, 
  does n't really make sense to ask this for europe , each country got their own leaders . 
  for austria maria theresa has a good rep , hitler was probably the worst . 
  more recent bruno kreisky was still a good social democrat and is remembered fairly well . 
  it 's actually quite a problem in the part of rural austria i live in ( innviertel ) . 
  young men around 19 years are the most problematic group of potential drunk drivers and that 's the age where most get their cars ( after military when you start to work ) . 
  it usually happens once a month in my vicinity , just 2 weeks ago a 19 y/o with 1,9 promille tried to drive home and crashed into a house . 
  at least he did n't die . 
  the probably most tragic case happened ~ 7 years ago when a car full of ~ ~ known neo-nazis ~ ~ people crashed into a tree . 
  the driver ( shitfaced , had no license ) died instantly , the other 5 ( ! ), 
  people ( with 1 pregnant women ) barely survived . 
  it 's better now compared to 10 years ago but many people still do n't take it serious enough . 
  one guy from my city ran for a political position and after celibrating a good election result he tried to drive home drunk . 
  police stopped him before he even got out of the parking lot because he looked `` lost '' . 
  police does a good job with setting up a lot of checkpoints after events and at the weekend but the real problem is the mindset of the population . 
  07-15 , altough i could start anywhere between 6 and 9 . 
  sometimes during week i stay until 16 or 17 to get home earlier on friday or if we got some stuff to do outside ( working as a surveyor ), 
  i actually do n't know them so that goes on my `` check it out '' - list, 
  i think i kinda get the joke but i had to do sone thinking lol . 
  the point is that the guy you tell the joke to does n't know either that it 's a german soldier and the last line reveals it , right ? 
  not exactly a commmon word to confuse but i got a funny story . 
  my grandmother was basically on her own with her brothers when she was a child as her father deserted and her mother got put in a workcamp as a consequence . 
  so when american soldiers arrived in her hometown she would always beg them for food . 
  now as context the german word `` geil '' is an adjective that can either mean `` horny '' or `` sexually attractive '' and sounds kinda close to `` gal '' or `` girl '' . 
  now my grandmother speaks no english so when an american soldier pointed at her and called her a gal or girl she misunderstood it horribly.she still dislikes americans even to this day ( they also gave her only chewing gum most of the time ) . 
  i was never allowed to say `` geil '' ( not that it 's a word you would use around your grandmother anyway ) because it 's a dirty american word in her mind . 
  it really is only a dirty german one tho , 
  eh , he 's honestly not that bad anymore . 
  dvammumtn are nice but i do n't think they do music anymore ( at least i have n't heard anything ), 
  feels like [ money boy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdzijdgj-lm ) is the only one we got . 
  could be worse . 
  not what i imagined but i 'd take any coastline i get, 
  while `` guten tag '' literally translates to `` good day '' , `` gr\u00fc\u00df gott '' literally translates to `` greet god '' ( however the real meaning would be more like `` may god greet you '' ) . 
  both have the same meaning really ( both are a formal greeting ) , but it 's like if people in the usa use `` good day '' exclusively and people in canada use `` greet god '' exclusively , an american ( or anyone really ) in canada using `` good day '' would stand out in a weird way . 
  `` guten tag '' is a german greeting and `` gr\u00fc\u00df gott '' is an austrian one , so using a german greeting in austria is not right . 
  same really with using `` gr\u00fc\u00df gott '' north of bavaria . 
  now if you add that austrians and germans dislike each other , sometimes as a friendly banter , often in a not-so-friendly way , using `` guten tag '' is not very well recieved . 
  remember that people around understand you even though you wo n't understand them . 
  https://youtu.be/5bc0xdlkple in this short learnvideo ( or whatever this is ) they say it at the start and at 0:50 there are also a woman and a man saying it, 
  i already heard that `` servus '' is a really formal greeting in the countries where it 's still understood . 
  i wonder why it became the friendly go-to greeting in austria/bavaria . 
  yeah , i think you 're right . 
  i live in the north and use mostly `` ciao '' , sometimes `` tsch\u00fcss '' but rarely . 
  `` auf wiederschaun '' also but it 's more formal . 
  and to be fair , when i 'm in germany it 's also kind of hard to adapt to `` guten tag '' . 
  yeah , `` habedere '' ( more like `` hawedere '' in my dialect ) is also common . 
  generally bavarian and austrian dialect is kinda similar ( helps that i live very close to bavaria ) while still noticeable different . 
  i also should add that i ca n't really speak for all of austria ( i 'm from upper austria ) . 
  people in vienna talk a more standard german , people in tyrol might use `` heil '' more commonly than `` servas '' and i do n't understand people from vorarlberg . 
  `` servus '' ( or `` servas '' where i live ) is actually the most common greeting in austria .
