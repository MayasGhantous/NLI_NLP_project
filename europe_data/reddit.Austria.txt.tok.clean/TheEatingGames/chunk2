  copenhagen has a hillsong church for example . 
  a church very known for having lots of young members , their facebook page has 11.000 likes and lots of pictures from events , that show what looks like young , native danes . 
  i heard this one before . 
  grow some balls . 
  look how fast erdogan bowed down to putin , cause he made a clear & strong statement by not allowing any russian tourists going to turkey anymore . 
  this is how you treat them , not only weak words about values or whatever . 
  lol , merkel could n't even lead elemantary school kids on a field trip, 
  haha no we do n't, 
  european countries have very restricted carry laws . 
  we are not meant to carry around our guns to stop terrorists . 
  they are for hunting , sports & home protection . 
  austria sadly has no offical statistic on illegal guns , but in germany for example , from all crimes commited with guns , only 3-5 % are legal weapons . 
  all the rest are illegal ones . 
  to focus your full attention on those 3 % seems pretty useless , huh ? 
  oh noez , there must be daily school shootings in crete , right ? 
  the weapons from the paris attacks were ** illegal ** . 
  some of them even came from germany , a country with very strict gun laws . 
  they were bought from an ** illegal ** weapon dealer . 
  none of them were bought in a ** legal gunstore ** in switzerland . 
  what are you on about ? 
  this is an eu law , but will affect switzerland too . 
  the eu has no right to impose their laws on a non-member . 
  the reason it can affect switzerland is because they are in schengen , so switzerland should leave schengen , simple as that . 
  the 3 eu countries this law affects are austria , estonia & czech republic . 
  and i hope we do n't go down without a fight . 
  why should the eu have any say in our right to own guns ? 
  your system is the one our right-wing party wants to have here . 
  so what the original commenter said makes no sense whatsover . 
  our current government is way on the left to canada on immigration . 
  and then of course it 's simply two non-comparable situations . 
  if canada was within reach to syria and afghanistan by foot , and a boat ride from africa , your parties would probably also adapt to that problem in ways similar to europe . 
  you hand-pick your refugees in a way we ca n't . 
  it 's not only about work tho , is it ? 
  lower educated people in cities for example also tend to live in areas with a high immigrat rate , and have their kids in school with lots of immigrants . 
  it 's very clear to see here in vienna . 
  higher educated people vote left wing , but as soon as they have children , they either move to the country side or send their kids to a private school . 
  the parents who ca n't afford that , are the ones stuck with the situation that their kid is one of the few native speakers in schools with 80 % + immigrants and big issues . 
  and then the private-school-parents give them shit for voting fp\u00d6 . 
  nope , the eu wants to force those laws on switzerland even tho they are not even eu members . 
  it 's an argument against eu membership , not for . 
  be smart & leave schengen , swiss neighbors . 
  it 's not worth it to give up your freedom . 
  not denk ? 
  how come canada has such strict immigration laws then ? 
  good for him that he is not up for re-election in sweden then . 
  i 'm for a point-based-system like canada has . 
  that way people like you and your brother , who are both skilled and also excited to come to europe , will get the chance , no matter where you are from . 
  this is n't what usually happens tho . 
  right now politicians confuse immigration with asylum . 
  before that , we got lower-skilled workers especially from turkey ( and we needed them , so okay ) but they all seem to come from a society that does n't value education , so their children and grandchildren are doing really poor in our schools , and many go straight to the welfare system . 
  and then go on the street to cheer for erdogan . 
  no thank you . 
  judging the comments on r/canada when it comes to trudeau , quite a bunch of canadians would probably prefer austrian politics . 
  congrats dutchies ; we on the other hand are the [ capital of racism ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/05/mevlut-cavusoglu-austria-capital-of-radical-racism-turkey ), 
  no wonder they are miserable & bitter , with faces like that . 
   they talk about a ( dutch ) culture , but when i look around i do n't see it . 
  is n't that the problem ? 
  the group of erdogan supporters in austria does exactly that , too . 
  they do n't watch austrian news or read austrian newspapers . 
  they watch akp tv via satellite . 
  the reason for that is that often they speak very poor german , and so they stay in a turkish media bubble . 
  would n't an insane amount of pictures fall under this law ? 
  for example : there are very famous , very graphic pictures from the vietnam war . 
  i do n't think anyone got in trouble recently publishing those ? 
  i would figure the amount of people who wo n't visit the uk anymore for ideological reasons will be very small . 
  london & the rest of the country have lots to offer for tourists , and if it 's a good deal money wise , they 'll come . 
  so if the pound gets weaker due brexit , even more reason to travel to the uk . 
  and any kind of visa regulations does n't stop tourists to travel all over the world . 
  if this means it will become easier for the rest of us to get theatre tickets for all the london productions , all the better tbh . 
  terrorism is defined as using violence for a political or ideological goal . 
  nothing about killing an ex-gf or something similar is political , even if it 's done in public causing fear . 
  same reason breivik is a terrorist , but the columbine shooters are n't . 
  breivik did it for his radical ideology , the columbine shooters had personal reasons . 
  many , many mosques in germany are getting all their financial support directly from the turkish government , and the imams preach pro-erdogan messages . 
  there 's some very basic information about it [ on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkish-islamic_union_for_religious_affairs ) . 
  since the coup , reports are coming up , that the turkish imams are spying within german-turkish communiteis who could be a ` g\u00fclen supporter ' or any other kind of anti-erdogan person , and they are reporting back to erdogan as some sort of hitlist . 
  i would assume that it would be wiser for them - for their own safety - to seek asylum in a country that does n't have such a big erdogan-loyal turkish population as germany does . 
  i ca n't follow your logic . 
  do you mean more abortions , leading to less babies born , would improve the situation of people in high crime neighborhoods ? 
  because if so , i can let you know that abortions are disproportionally high in african-american communities already . 
  a black american woman is 5 times more likey to have an abortion than a white woman . 
  trump completely aside , it 's very naive to think european parties could mysteriously solve chicago gang violence with a more european approach . 
  i agree . 
  if you are young , educated & living in an urban area it 's very fair to say that most of your peers would assume you to be rather liberal , atheist/agnostic , pro-eu , ... the whole deal . 
  if you are female , being a feminist & pro-choice is assumed too . 
  those believes are definitely mainstream for people under a certain age . 
  so watson has a point . 
  if you are a 16-year-old with modern , liberal parents , then putting on a modest dress , going to church every sunday & joining a pro-life group will probably shock them more than if you dye your hair green & getting a ` fuck the patriarchy ' tattoo . 
  i think the big problem is that in order to fight the false claims online , people choose the defense of saying absolutely any claim of any no-go-zones is bullshit and should only be met with shakira law jokes etc. 
  that 's also bullshit . 
  i do think molenbeek qualifies for example . 
  remember the arrest of the surviving paris attacker ? 
  during the arrest , people were throwing rocks and other things at the police . 
  why did they do it ? 
  there are two possibilities : 1 . 
  they knew the terrorist was hiding there , and wanted to protect him , give him time to flee . 
  they did n't know why police was there , but throwing rocks is their regular reaction to seeing a police car . 
  while both of those answers are equally alarming , option 1 would make it more of a terrorism-supporting community than a no-go zone . 
  option 2 however is the definition of a no-go zone ( even if they fail to stop police from entering , they are trying ) and there 's definitely a new reality in european cities , of ambulances needing police escort when being called to certain areas . 
  because the ambulance workers are being attacked upon arrival otherwise .
