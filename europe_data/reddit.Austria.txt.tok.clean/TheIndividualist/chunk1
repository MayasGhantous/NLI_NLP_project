  he had quite a following back then , especially in carinthia . 
  as much as i detest haider , he was a seemingly smart politican who knew his way with words and seemed capable .

   polandball was basically created to cause butthurt over at krautchan 's / int so i personally do n't mind . 
  according to this map the shqip is n't real . 
  therefore a chunk of my family never existed . 
  which means i 'm a fucking paradox .

  i find british people to be festive , very polite and good company in general . 
  i 'm not sharing their view of the eu tho . 
  and my guess is that their euroscepticism results from their history of being a former independent world power .
