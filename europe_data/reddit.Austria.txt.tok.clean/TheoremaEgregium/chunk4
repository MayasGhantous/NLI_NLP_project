  on the other hand , some countries seem to have lost their traditional religious identity for good , such as eastern germany or czechia . 
  though there were probably additional factors which made them amendable to that . 
  in any case , it seems to me that lately this recent erdo\u011fan adventure has departed from islamism towards classic nationalism . 
  as we know all too well from europe 's history , nationalism often uses religion but is it 's own thing . 
  the impression i 'm getting from the recent rhetoric , this is not about the umma , it is about empire . 
  it 's just the [ greek national costume ] ( http://www.columbusgreekfestival.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/evzones2.jpg ) . 
  :-) what i wonder : did the turkish population switch to secularism during the time of atat\u00fcrk , and now back again , or was that just a phenomenon of government and the urban elites , and most of the population stayed the same all throughout ? 
  they are being reshuffled and regrouped every few years in rather arbitrary ways , sometimes in order to accomodate the political situation . 
  and it is not `` women 's health '' , it 's `` women , and health '' . 
  they used to be seperate ministries . 
  but do n't ask me what the ministerium f\u00fcr ein lebenswertes \u00d6sterreich ( ministry for an austria worth living in ) does , i have no clue . 
  you 've got a department of climate change ? 
  not leaving things to chance , huh ? 
  if the climate is changing it is to be done by dedicated professionals who 'll make sure it changes in the proper way . 
  is that so ? 
  in that case i am sorry , i must have misremembered . 
  my point was that it was not the jury who overruled the popular vote . 
  they had picked australia for the win . 
  it was all set in motion already when ukraine won with a song that was clearly politically charged . 
  we could all see where this was heading . 
  not that i 'm disputing jamala 's win , it was all fair , ~ ~ a clear audience voting result ~ ~ ( alright , she won because both audience and jury had her in 2nd palce , but not the same one in 1st ) . 
  but this now is just petty . 
  however , i admit we might be underestimating how things are in ukraine right now . 
  there * is * a war going on , after all . 
  maybe there should be an allowance for that . 
  all in all , a really unfortunate situation . 
  i did not know that about us , but austria 's got a bit of a reputation for not giving back royal heirlooms . 
  we 're hanging on to the crown of [ moctezuma ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montezuma%27s_headdress ) as well . 
  not to mention the [ crown of the holy roman empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imperial_crown_of_the_holy_roman_empire ) -- although i have n't heard germany complain about that one yet . 
  some asshole would just spray over it a week later with his skill-less name tags . 
  we have places at the riverside where you get the most spectacular graffiti and they all get destroyed like that eventually . 
  shame . 
  there ought to be an honor code among sprayers to only spray over something if yours is clearly going to be * better * . 
  sure , but as this gallery of title pages proves they are currently very much not shutting up . 
  it 's not even flying-under-the-radar subtle at all . 
  once upon a time people had to write their satire in a way so that the censor simply would n't get it . 
  it seems nobody is yet forced to learn this lost art again . 
  them getting sued is not scary all by itself . 
  when charlie hebdo branched out into germany a couple of months ago , their very first issue immediately lead to complaints with the presserat ( press council ) , the german media 's self-censorship association , for diffamation of chancellor merkel . 
  admittedly , the worst that can happen to them from that is a stern reprimand . 
  and so are militaries and intelligence agencies ( think cia , nsa ) . 
  it 's not about getting the job done , it 's about providing business opportunities for friend 's friends . 
  but the building scandals are probably unintentional fuckups for the most part . 
  in austria we never had a big projects without scandals . 
  in my university building they had to make the ceilings lower because they had forgotten to reserve enough space for wiring and plumbing . 
  and in the big central hospital in vienna i was told that after the elevators had been installed it was found that they were not wide enough to accomodate hospital beds . 
  the corruption and bribery involved in the thing is quite another matter though . 
  now i am curious what will come from the probe into the acquisition of dreadfully overprized eurofighter jets 10 years ago . 
  there are allegations of bribery in the scale of 100 mils . 
  i am just a silly foreigner who does n't know shit , but these magazines are produced and sold inside turkey , are n't they ? 
  how on earth are the editors still outside prison ? 
  are they considered harmless clowns ? 
  are there subtle rules which kind of ridicule of the government is allowed and which is n't ? 
  well ... the germans * do * seem to have a bit of trouble finishing their new berlin airport , so ... 
  and vienna zoo killed all of theirs last week to prevent the spread of bird flu . 
  nobody minds a hitler joke as long as it is good and we have not heard it too many times . 
  of course that is getting increasingly difficult . 
  same goes for trump jokes . 
  he needs to keep providing new material , the pre-election stuff is getting stale . 
  indeed voting is what defines democracy . 
  i was in barcelona last week and on montju\u00efc i saw a tiny ancient seat with a sign behind the windshield saying , `` please do n't steal this car , it has no value whatsoever ! '', 
  fp\u00d6 believed to start sliding soon , what with the government hijacking some of their agenda on immigration , their bid for the presidency having been foiled , and the upcoming probe into corruption during the acquisition of very expensive fighter jets 15 years ago in which fp\u00d6 was involved . 
  interestingly , not quite . 
  the eu hymn is just the tune , it does not include the lyrics from schiller 's poem/beethoven 's symphony . 
  i suppose having the official hymn have words in * german * would have meant trouble with some other eu countries . 
  with women 's rights as well , seeing how schiller wrote about all people `` becoming brothers '' . 
  would have to update to `` siblings '' . 
  which leaves the passage of about the joy of having acquired a pretty wive ( '' ... wer ein holdes weib errungen '' ) . 
  it was an essay he wrote [ in 2011 for german paper * taz * ] ( http://www.taz.de/!5114887/ ) . 
  in it he recommeded that once it was devoid of inhabitants the german territory should be distributed among its neighboring countries . 
  it was obviously at least to some extens meant satirically , but i do n't think anybody could write such a thing without at least some genuine hatred for germany . 
  and i suspect that had he written the same thing about turkey he would already have been arrested * in germany * -- for hate speech . 
  but he clearly is no friend of erdogan . 
  apparently the man has a brutal sense of humour and stands in the tradition of satirical gadflies who hate * everything * ( like charlie hebdo , i suppose ) . 
  he should of course not be imprisoned for that . 
  maybe if germany does its utmost to get him out of his predicament he will have a reason to think more charitably about the country . 
  that 's what i hope . 
  why not ? 
  we know people can hold a grudge for thousands of years , so why not also thankfulness and commemoration ? 
  it sure is a handsome looking caf\u00e9 , but are you sure this is a war you want to start ? 
  i 'm still trying to figure out how he could make `` eye '' and `` symmetry '' rhyme . 
  fun fact : the `` leo '' in eastern austria is derived from the region 's patron saint , markgrave leopold iii . 
  our saint protects us . 
  at least we can all agree that r/the _ schulz is a result of the rise of trump ... 
  makes me think that basement-dwelling single young guys are the political power of the future ( and present ) , because they are the chief meme-mongers . 
  nobody will be able to win an election without that population segment behind them . 
  somehow that is a scary thought . 
  when the owner of our most infamous tabloid was old he gave an interview where they asked him if he was ashamed of anything his newspaper had printed . 
  he said `` yes , the fact that we kept the horoscopes . '', 
  honestly , not that horoscopes ever worked ( cicero already made the argument more than 2000 years ago ) , but the old-time astrologers at least did mathematics and shit , whereas i am sure they now just pull it out of their ass or throw dice . 
  we also get them , as well as polish religion teachers for schools . 
  i think it is because there is a shortage of homegrown priests . 
  tricky business . 
  salzburg at the time was an independent bishopric , but considered one of the german states ( although you could well argue that * austria * was one of the german states herself ) anyway , by the same rationale liszt would have to be considered austrian instead of hungarian . 
  we usually see mozart as austrian and liszt as hungarian , which is not very consistent , but i am fine with it . 
  funny other example : with franz kafka wikipedia simply gave up and called him a `` german-language writer '' , because neither `` austrian writer '' not `` czech writer '' seems to work . 
  would n't discount bruckner and mahler either . 
  and so does the logo of germany 's own coca cola knockoff , [ afri-cola ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/afri-cola ) . 
  how are danish politicians ? 
  viewed from austria german politicians are masterful orators , and refreshingly straightforward .
