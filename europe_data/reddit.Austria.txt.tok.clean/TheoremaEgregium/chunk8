  but not `` great '' . 
  about the sports thing ... i once read a sociologist explain that sports are only of limited use in efforts to socialize and integrate young male refugees and immigrants from chechnya or afghanistan . 
  that 's because the only sports they accept are football and martial arts . 
  all others are not masculine enough for them . 
  honestly , i can not understand how anybody can manage to keep up these incredibly restricting rules for being considered a healthy , moral , non-gay man in such a culture without * ever * slipping up . 
  i mean , they would beat me up as gay just for doing yoga and reading a book . 
  [ really not ?

  of course she is . 
  that 's why she is so tall . 
  these dark satanic mills ... in england 's green and pleasant land . 
  he was an olympic swimmer , and had a law degree too . 
  he also toured as a singer-songwriter for a time . 
  all around one hell of a guy . 
  we all love us some bud spencer !, 
  that is an interesting question . 
  there might be something in galois theory , considering its historical application , but from the little i remember from my advanced algebra courses ( not my forte ! ), 
  i can not help you there . 
  but you are probably aware of the following facts : * an algebraic equation has zeros that are either real or pairs of complex conjugates if and only if it can be written with real coefficients . 
  thus ( assuming you want real coefficients ) your rectangles must be symmetrical around the real axis . 
  squares as a special case can also have one vertex on each side of each axis like in x ^ 4 -- 1 . 
  * if the equation is symmetrical around zero , it will only have nonzero coefficients for even exponents of x ( in your example x ^ 4 , x ^ 2 and x ^ 0 ) . 
  * translation , rotation and uniform scaling of the figure can be achieved by replacing * x * in the equation with * t * + * t * \u00b7 * e * ^ * ia * \u00b7 * x * . 
  this will result in a complex equation unless the zeros stay/become real or complex conjugates . 
  rotating your square by 45 \u00b0 . 
  * the transformations above are special cases of affine transformations . 
  in the complex plane the general affine transformation can be written as * a * \u00b7 * x * + * b * \u00b7 conj ( * x * ) + * t * for some complex numbers * a * , * b * , * t * ( * a * and * b * must have different absolute values for the transformation to be bijective ) . 
  for example to scale the imaginary axis by a factor of * s * and the real axis by * t * you can use ( * s * + * t * ) / 2 \u00b7 * x * + ( * s * -- * t * ) / 2 \u00b7 conj ( * x * ) . 
  this results in an equation that is not algebraic ( because it contains complex conjugates ) , but which is equivalent to some algebraic equation . 
  that algebraic equation is trivial to find when you know the zeros , but if not i do n't see an obvious way to do it . 
  of course that was precisely your question , was n't it ? 
  hey !, 
  you 're the first ever to mention my username . 
  :-) i am a mathematician by training ( specializing in geometry ) , and gau\u00df is my personal hero . 
  i used to wear a button with his portrait on my lapel for a while , but stopped because i feared it might give people strange ideas about me . 
  all those donald duck comics were translated by a single woman , erika fuchs , who had a thing for the classics . 
  her translations are peppered with historical allusions , deliberately antiquated phrasing and classical quotes ( like schiller ) . 
  german people do n't notice how weird it is in comparison to the originals because they grew up with it . 
  ( i was a teenager when i first found out he 's called `` scrooge '' in english and though `` how weird is that ! '' ), 
  like your teacher said we distinguish * katholisch * , * evangelisch * and * orthodox * . 
  evangelisch has nothing to do with `` evangelical christianity '' , it is just a synonym for protestant . 
  apparently the protestants are seperated into lutherans and calvinists . 
  the latter are a small group , which is evidenced by the fact that i was not even aware of them until this post . 
  i always figured that all austrian protestants were lutheran . 
  the orthodox are mostly russian , serbian and greek . 
  they are sometimes grouped together and sometimes seperate . 
  there 's a bunch of very small churches too , but those are treated as mostly harmless cults , they do n't play much part in the `` official '' religious description of the country . 
  there are some you may not have heard of , like the [ old catholics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_catholic_church ) . 
  the church of england is usually not lumped with the austrian protestants and only exists w.r.t. 
  expats ( their only church building is opposite the british embassy ) . 
  another note : when you tell an austrian `` i am a christian '' they assume you are catholic , that 's the `` default '' christianity ( different in germany , of course ) . 
  is it true that there are some in the us who are not sure whether catholics are * really * christian at all ? 
  i heard that and it sounds extremely weird . 
  * mu\u00df * is just pre-reform-of-1996 spelling . 
  aside from the double-headed ones mexico has the coolest eagle . 
  it 's grabbing a snake !, 
  obviously nothing to do with the roman aquila . 
  it goes back to a story of the aztecs . 
  they were wandering around in the land when they encountered an eagle fighting a snake , which they took as an omen from the gods and built their capital city tenochtitlan in that spot . 
  close . 
  not only did i read them , i also was a contestant in the game show which brezina was hosting ( i won some board games and a book about icelandic ponies . 
  what a letdown . ), 
  anyway , i read about 30 of the knickerbocker books but never found out what a `` knickerbocker '' actually is . 
  some sort of pants , apparently . 
   it 's not the most flattering animal why ? 
  it 's a big dangerous apex predator and the most popular stuffed toy animal at the same time . 
  few animals are as glorious as the bear . 
  the north ( vojvodina ) is perfectly fine . 
  i was in sremska mitrovica 10 times when i had a girlfriend there , never had any kind of problem . 
  young people speak english fine . 
  roads can be quite rough in the villages but it never felt unsafe , just hard on the suspension . 
  one time my father was with us and the police flagged us down . 
  he was sweating bullets fearing he 'd have to bribe someone now . 
  they just said `` your tail light 's off . 
  just wanted to tell you , have a good day !, 
  u/omdathetkonxd or horace ? 
  said a roman poet who himself died peacefully in bed . 
  when my old school had its 125 years ' anniversary , they invited old otto habsburg as a guest of honor because emperor franz joseph had founded the school back in the day . 
  the school 's headmaster printed an invitation where he referred to him as `` his imperial highness otto von habsburg '' . 
  boy , did he get a dressing down from his superior for that !, 
  english teachers at my engineering high school ( htl ) would have been thrilled if their students ' spelling had been good enough to make the distinction . 
  and in any case half of the teachers had an atrocious accent themselves . 
  schools traditionally teach british . 
  of course between youtube and netflix and the internet in general people are so much immersed in ae that this is what they naturally orient their pronunciation and vocabulary towards . 
  i daresay that at the point when they leave school most students are not fluent enough to notice the difference in any case . 
  i believe rammstein are generally agreed to be weird . 
  but also check out austria 's [ 2003 esc entry ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gosvqykcfa ) . 
  it 's vaguely about animals , but makes no sense whatsoever . 
  ah , i remembered another on : like rammstein , helge schneider is german , but you asked about the language . 
  the song title in english means [ cat litter box ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzq3_masebo ) , and that 's what the song is about ( and the fact that the cat eats so damn much ) . 
  it was a huge hit back in 1993 . 
  liechtenstein of course . 
  that 's surprising . 
  i see them being sold everywhere now , in dime stores and street markets , and they were on the tv news too . 
  they claimed the things drive teachers nuts because all their students are spinning . 
  guess that is vienna for you . 
   yeah , i had english in primary school so did i , twice each week at 7:30 before regular classes . 
  a great way to condition kids at an early age that english is a nasty thing best to avoid . 
   ( i 'm sure you know it , right ? ), 
  no , ca n't say that i do , sorry .
