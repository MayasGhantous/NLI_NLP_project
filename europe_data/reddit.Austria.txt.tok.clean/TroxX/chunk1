it was edited , 
  in this map you forgot south tirol :p they speak german there o.o, 
  georgians are good in judo  i only hear from them there o.o, 
  same here in austria, 
  there are areas in vorarlberg where they speak kind of similiar dialect because people from wallis moved there ... gro\u00dfes & kleines walsertal , 
  the thirty year war was a huge fuck up !, 
  but at that time `` germany '' wasnt germany -  holy roman german empire and the kaiser at the time was a habsburger :p so basically it was austrian fuck up !, 
  in europe there is enough competition ... for me its also socials views ... in the usa a worker depending on the company only got 2 weeks of vacation a year !? 
  so a lot of people get abused ... cant afford insurance ... what drops the prices ... then they ship the stuff over the sea and go into the market super cheap ... for the consumer at first awesome but in the long run it sucks ... 
  but in the long run the companies destroy ( i know worst case szenario ) , the market / competition in europe . 
  but what does that mean for european normal people ? 
  they will lose their jobs due to the extreme competition ... 
  so for fuck sake no to ceta & ttip . 
  as long as in north america there is to much capitalism i wont support something like that . 
  why should i ship something from canada or the usa to europe ? 
  if we got here the same stuff ? 
  for example : shipping a car form the usa or canada costs also money ... is bad for the environment because you have to ship a bloody car over the ocean ... then i got an option for a german car ... where this isnt the issue ... so a german car it is . 
  how can you judge me with a sentence like this without even knowing me ? 
  there are just to many things that disturb me in ceta ... and europe should start working on things like stay in 1 building and dont move between strassburg & br\u00fcssel thats just throwing out money ... there are many more small issues that should be solved before doing something like ceta ... and well fuck ceta !, 
  and fuck ttip really hard !, 
  ps i \u00b4 m not a capitalist thats why i \u00b4 m against ceta :p, 
  i \u00b4 m honestly happy that belgium/wallonia didnt sign for it . 
  because ceta is a backdoor ( hihi backdoor ) version of ttip . 
  compare it more like you go to peru / cusco or bolivia la paz . 
  the sun wont be as strong but it will be freaking cold . 
  bring as warm cloths as possible !, 
  because you arent used to the cold . 
  and it is better to have it warm than to have cold ... and you always can take something of . 
  wait what ? 
  wasnt stiglitz a nazi hunter ? 
  you can thank otto von bismark for that ... 
  i wouldnt say that left is for legalization of drugs ... this has more to be with is somebody liberal or conservative , because a politican can be far right for example against refuggees but for the legalization of weed . 
  this would be a perfect example for a right - liberal , i personally can only think of 1 typical austrian politician that suits this and this would be matthias strolz from neos . 
  left-winged people tend to be more liberal than right winged , but there are also - left - conservatives ( really super rare species ) . 
  thats what people often mix up , to left is for the most people in reality too liberal . 
  found this in german : quite often people mix liberal with left ... but it isnt there are also right - liberals  for everybody who is good in german they should check it out ... ( austrian political example ) https://youtu.be/heexaccigik, 
  lol :d this ended badly for my hometown ice-hockey club . 
  https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/veu_feldkirch they were 2 times champion of the european hockey league 1997/98 and then they went bankrupt ... because they couldnt afford the players because the town is so small ( and fanbase 2 ) compared to clubs of a big city . 
  you wont find a special place in europe ... that people hate ... 
  it 's more about the area/languages ... german speakers hate for example about france/french speaking part of beglium/french speaking part of switzerland . 
  that nearly nobody can speak another language ... or better they are quite often not willing to speak english even if they can . 
  thats what i hate ... 
  shameless ? 
  this song was made for pegida & afd https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_jqkxvenae, 
  to my region : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wfgzcayess, 
  jaja < 3 pura vida hermano solo en un lugar donde no ay gringos ... 
  in 5 min car drive i can stand in liechtenstein or switzerland . 
  give me 30 and i \u00b4 m in germany . 
  there is also `` hard '' or `` sateins '' ( german tv station ), 
  its only the half truth in west-austria its 3 kisses , 
  ludendorf tried to help hilter to claim power so from the now perspective he is a really bad person :( for example otto von bismark is to be said one of the `` founders '' of germany kind of ... but he only wanted a united germany under the rule of preusen ... and pushed austria away because austria was him too much multi cultural ... 
  the only people that i met while traveling ... that werent native speakers of german and i talked german with were people from latin america that went to german schools ( like american schools ) . 
  german is way more harder to learn than english . 
  those people were the only ones that had a level of german that i said yeah i will talk german to them so that i know they will understand everything :p because what people dont realize there is also slang in german ... 
  hc strache and norbert hofer ... 
  ... it \u00b4 s an alemanic dialect , if you want to listen to a few songs in that dialect here are some examples and you will here its extremely different to the rest of austria & germany . 
  and dont call it swiss german dialect swiss german has a lot of differences ... :p the vorarlberger dialect is influenced more by the austrian dialects regarding the words than by the swiss german , because swiss german is a lot influenced by french ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufmo7yuccmk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmi2m06yffc https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcz_e8vqgwg, 
  i heard hell is just a sauna ? 
  a foot massage is something really personal ... plup fiction ? 
  same shit like j\u00f6rg haider ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujtkfxuk55e, 
  z\u00fcrich  nice awesome town, 
  france , switzerland and nearly every state in the balkan ... 
  check if they dont cheat on you with a turned off taxi-meter , that happens quite a lot to tourists . 
  they just say a random number for a distance . 
  besides that they try to rip you off in the taxi prague is awesome . 
  and has got good and awesome beer . 
  in flames - cloud connected https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7iis91fmac, 
  hungary wan na join again / b/ro ? 
  germans - pifki ( it \u00b4 s like gringo in latin america ) switzerland - rich and extremely right winged czech - cheap and good beer italians - cant trust them they will backstab you + lazy liechtenstein - the monarch lived long time in austria hungary - kind of our former brother ? 
  german rap is quite big since there are more countrys where german is an official language . 
  germany , austria , switzerland , liechtenstein , ... 
  but in switzerland and liechtenstein they tend to also use the local dialects of german for rap . 
  you think it is ... 
  but people from latin america will get offended ... just saying ... 
  i can only tell between the border of austria with liechtenstein & switzerland . 
  pre schengen people that worked in switzerland / liechtenstein had a sign on the car that said `` grenzg\u00e4nger '' ~ they work in switzerland so they can go threw faster . 
  sometimes they would control the cars and passports . 
  the checks were completely random . 
  switzerland and liechtenstein are also in schengen even both are not in the eu . 
  so now sometimes there is somebody at the border and very rarely they check but most often they check swiss people from liechtenstein if they have to declare stuff or so . 
  since i work in another country i havent been checked even once . 
  they are way more popular in europe than in the usa . 
  look at judo for example how many europeans won a medal at the olympics and then the us . 
  judo is the biggest fighting sport in germany . 
  japanese jiu jistsu isnt that popular in europe , but brazilian jiu jitsu is a little bit more popular but mainly those ufc/mma dudes practice it , so its more a niche . 
  * teddy riner, 
  you are from the usa not from america !!!, 
  america is north , central and south america . 
  when i \u00b4 m hiking i always say `` berg hail '' and all the german tourists are like ... `` what ? 
  did he just say hail ? '', 
  and then they look confused . 
  `` berg hail '' is kinda the same like `` waidmans hail '' from the hunters . 
  in austria they still got the cliche that they will screw you over ... for people that dont know why ... ww1 and ww2 . 
  and for the italiens reading this ... south tyrol is basically still austria . 
  but we are all in the eu now so nobody cares ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr8ljrgcjnm yes since they joined ww1 ... 
  they are just crazy !, 
  they give somebody a statue because he killed somebody and in the following of the events it came to war ... it \u00b4 s like if you give jamie lannister a statue for pushing bran out of the window ... 
  the serbs are still crazy ... http://www.dw.com/en/gavrilo-princip-assassin-who-sparked-wwi-gets-statue-in-belgrade/a-18546305, 
  serbia had and still has a stupid nationalistic thinking ... ( we saw that in the 90 \u00b4 s ) .
