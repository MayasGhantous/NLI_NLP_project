  reddit just is n't as big in many european countries and the few far-leftists are mostly active in their respective country-subs - or at least that 's the case in r/austria and r/de . 
  you could try asking in r/nostupidquestions or in r/findareddit . 
  not in austria . 
  if a public holiday is a sunday , it 's tough luck for everyone , but you do n't get an extra day off . 
  no problem . 
  also , bring a student/high school id if you have one . 
  some sites ( at least in austria ) give discounts to students , more so than discounts for being < 18 . 
  hey there . 
  it very much depends on how you want to spend that money . 
  even in western european countries , you can get food from a street vendor for 3-5 euros . 
  i 'm talking about a slice of pizza ( 3-ish ) or a kebab sandwich ( 4ish ) . 
  supermarkets are also a good option for getting a baguette plus maybe some sausage and cheese . 
  if you go to actual restaurants , you 'll pay around 10 euros for a meal , again depending on type of restaurant and time of day . 
  some chinese restaurants or pizzerias here have lunch specials for ~ 8 euros . 
  considering you are on an organized group tour , your options may be limited as maybe the whole group will stop somewhere for a meal , but you should always have time to stroll away from the group and find a supermarket . 
  some tips : gas stations , especially along highways are most expensive for little snacks . 
  so are restaurants near popular tourist sites . 
  try to get your stuff in supermarkets a few streets away from tourist areas and think ahead of what you might want to eat/snack for the next 24/48 hours . 
  are entrance fees covered ? 
  do you want to buy souvenirs ? 
  personally , i 'd feel more comfortable with 500 euros . 
  that gives you ~ 25 $ per day , and if it 's too much , you can always bring some money back home . 
  have fun !, 
  we have very few immigrants from any of these countries so i do n't think there are specific stereotypes about them in austria . 
  the only thing i can think of is that chinese people in austria probably run a restaurant , as they are fairly popular . 
  thailand is a popular tourist destination for us , but it has the reputation of being a shady place for sex tourists and/or to find an import bride . 
  which is a shame because it 's an insanely beautiful country . 
  the very few sikhs here are usually mistaken for muslims because of their turban . 
  yes , i was just comparing us to austria . 
  i guess everywhere that requires long distance travel to the mountains would consider skiing expensive . 
  the same we austrians would consider surfing an expensive hobby , while for californians or hawaiians it 's just a normal way to spend the afternoon . 
  yes , afaik they do , but none of those are in austria . 
  yes , aspen , colorado . 
   i 've never been to aspen , but i think it has the reputation of being an expensive resort town , so that 's what my comparison was referring to . 
  if you 're taking the car to go to ljubljana from vienna , you could also stop in graz . 
  nice views from the * schlossberg * mountain [ over the city ] ( http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/03/f0/61/03f061f4a1d8e65f09ac89880faa623d.jpg ) . 
  the drive from vienna to ljubljana is definitely a scenic one ( autobahn a2 ) and would give you some nice sceneries and photo ops . 
  since the budapest-ljubljana train seems to be sub par , you could go back and through vienna . 
  so prague -  ( 4hr ) -  vie -  3hr -  budapest -  3hr -  vienna -  4hr ? 
  i do n't know exactly how often they go from vienna to ljubljana , but there are trains every hour from vienna to graz which is half way to ljubljana and i 'm assuming at least a few of those continue to ljubljana . 
  or rent a car in vienna and go to ljubljana for 2 or 3 days by car and take the car back to vienna . 
  it 's definitely better for you to take the car back to its original spot , since i 'm not sure how easy/difficult it is to drop the car off in a different country . 
  how do you intend to travel from place to place ? 
  unless you fly between most of the places they are too far apart . 
  to compare it to the us , you are planning to go to nyc , dc , orlando , chicago , la and seattle . 
  that 's a lot of jumping around . 
  i would advise to pick a smaller region of europe and visit cities that are closer and travel by train between them . 
  imho you 'd have a better experience . 
  other than that , the amount of days you have allocated for the cities is ok , i think , although some people spend maybe a day more in rome . 
  also try r/travel for itinerary help and critique . 
   with a photographer 's eye for amazing high views of the city ( especially at dusk or evening ) . 
  recommendations here would be greatly appreciated as well . 
  missed this part in my previous comment , so here 's a few tips : in budapest you have the views over the city `` built in '' as one part of the city ( i think * buda * ) is on a hill and overlooks the city . 
  it 's been a while since i 've been but i think it gives you [ this view ] ( http://s.inyourpocket.com/gallery/108367.jpg ) . 
  vienna : definitely head up the * kahlenberg * hill/mountain . 
  it gives you a [ great view over the city ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5201/5301959066_b86e0646ac.jpg ) . 
  you can get there by public transport or take a cab . 
  in the picture , you see a [ ferris wheel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiener_riesenrad ) which is in the * prater * amusement park . 
  another option for a view from above . 
  there is also the [ donauturm ( danube tower ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donauturm ) which has an observation deck . 
  there 's also a rotating restaurant up there which might be your best option to take pictures at night . 
  not sure about reservations or how much it costs . 
  for more tips you can ask in our sub r/wien . 
   the association of ski resorts with rich people well , this is more of an american thing , tbh . 
  i know that in the us skiing is more of an upper class or at least expensive sport . 
  that 's very different in austria , where it 's a sport for the masses . 
  some 50 % of austria is mountains and everybody living there lives within 10 minutes of a skiing resort and locals often get discounts for season tickets . 
  even from vienna it 's only a 1-hour drive to a small resort . 
  in austria , skiing is even on the school curriculum . 
  in 6th and 7th grade all kids go on a 1-week skiing trip with their sports teachers . 
  so other than kitzb\u00fchel there are many resorts in austria that are not expensive or upper class at all . 
  well , there is vienna , particularly the inner city where i think russians like to buy penthouses , but they are not too many . 
  in western austria , there is [ kitzb\u00fchel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kitzb%c3%bchel ) which has in recent years become the `` aspen of austria '' . 
  land prices are through the roof and the rich and famous like to hang out there , particularly during the weekend of the [ hahnenkamm alpine skiing race ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hahnenkamm,_kitzb%c3%bchel#hahnenkamm_race ) once a year . 
  i think germans are the largest foreign group there . 
  third would be [ lake w\u00f6rth ( w\u00f6rthersee ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c3%b6rthersee ) in southern austria . 
  very expensive lakeside mansions , but most of them ( i think ) still owned by austrians . 
  but the richest woman of germany , heidi flick has a villa there ( she inherited the fortune of [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/friedrich_karl_flick ) ), 
  nah , u/19djafoij02 is a regular here and definitely not a troll . 
   not very common , a fringe ideology held by extremists at most . 
  yep , same in austria . 
  most anti-americanism here is your average criticism of certain foreign policy decisions and the same type of guy-at-the-pub bitching that all influential countries get . 
  also , op , the stereotypes about americans are n't worse or more pronounced than the stereotypes americans have about other countries . 
  europe is socialist , french are quitters , germans are nazis , russians are commies , mexicans are lazy , blah , blah , blah . 
  yeah , if you want hostels and airbnb 's which are in the larger cities , then please do n't bother renting a car for the whole trip . 
  in prague , vienna and budapest you 'd literally park it in the outskirts of the city , not use it for 3 days and then return to it just to go to the next city . 
  complete waste of money . 
  all sightseeing in those cities can be done using public transport and/or walking . 
  ca n't speak about slovenia , as that 's the one place i have n't visited in my adult life . 
   what you could do , is plan your trip around cities and train travel , and if in one of the cities you have something a little further away , you could rent a car for day trips from that city . 
  like u/panceltic wrote , the capital cities of the countries you want to visit are very well connected by train . 
  travel times are about 2 to 4 hours , and there are multiple trains every day . 
  so if you want to visit cities primarily , the train is your best option . 
  it takes you into the city and you can then use further public transport to proceed to your hotel . 
  also , european cities are n't perfect for cars , and in vienna a car would be a complete waste of money , as you probably could n't even park it near your hotel ( need a sticker only locals can get . ), 
  in recent years , long distance bus services have also become available and they can be cheaper than the train . 
  i 've never used them myself but [ fernbus.de ] ( http://fernbus.de/ ) and [ flixbus ] ( https://www.flixbus.com/ ) are two operators i 've heard of . 
  that said , if money is not an issue traveling by car can be nice as it allows you to stop in small towns , villages , by a lake or whatever . 
  you could even consider staying at campsites if you want to spend a significant amount of your trip outside of the large cities . 
  for the large cities , you 'd have to do a little research as to where to best park your car while in the city .
