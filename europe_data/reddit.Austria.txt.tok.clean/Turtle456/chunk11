  not sure how widespread in europe this is but in austria and germany it 's pretty important to keep eye contact when you cheers with someone . 
  i 'm not an expert on this and since i 'm not affected i do n't know all the details , but what i gather from watching a lot of german political debate shows is : * they are not doing much * . 
  the things mentioned by u/idkfa _ cz do exist , but afaik these are not recent reforms to specifically battle the low fertility rate . 
  maternity leave , allowance , etc have been around forever . 
  i 'm a little bit puzzled myself that the shrinking population is n't a more pressing issue for germany , and it seems to me they are mostly relying on immigration to keep the population at least at current levels . 
  by this i do n't mean the recent refugees but germany has had quite a bit of immigration from other european countries so far . 
  i think in germany there is a big divide between conservatives , who want to focus on traditional gender roles , and the left . 
  so you have the bavarian csu who wants to give women more money if they stay at home with their children , and the left who advocates for more child care facilities so mothers can go work * and * have children . 
  there is also disagreement over a proposed `` immigration law '' ( like us , au , ca ) which the conservatives refuse to pass and the left has been calling for for at least a decade . 
  all these different political views lead to the situation that currently germany is n't really doing anything effective to battle low birth rates , and there definitely is n't a big national master plan . 
  there is not even a significant national debate . 
  but i keep hearing experts say that in the coming years germany would need some 400.000 people * net * immigration just to replace employees that are retiring . 
  like i said , not an expert , but this is my impression . 
  maybe some germans know more than me . 
  in austria , the apprentice was n't broadcast and afaik he does n't have any hotels or other properties in austria . 
  however , the name `` trump '' was kinda known , but i think more as a tabloid personality , if that makes sense . 
  for some reason , i think his previous wife ivana trump was sorta known . 
  but donald definitely was n't a tv star here , and most people would n't have known about his previous political statements , i.e. 
  the birther stuff or that he used to be a democrat . 
  i think he was mostly known as some billionaire who liked to marry supermodels and did n't mind seeing his picture in tabloids . 
  like many others have said , just another historical figure but with not much relevance for today 's times . 
  since this is r/askeurope and if you 're wondering whether we consider him a `` great european '' and feel a deep connection to him : not in austria . 
  i think the the roman empire is more relevant for us . 
  well , i 'm one of the older guys here , so i 've gone through a few stages already . 
  i grew up in the countryside and until the end of high school , i went to one of two bars in the small town i went to high school at . 
  between 18-21 i was really into punk music and went to every concert there was . 
  also , lots of beer with my friends from university . 
  then i discovered electronic music and started going mostly to small clubs and the above mentioned * parties * , where my particular style of music was played . 
  good times , but due to old age (  30 ) my partying days are mostly over . 
  in the austrian countryside , it 's usually smaller bars , cafes and maybe clubs , depending on the size of the town . 
  places are usually open til 2 am on weekdays and around 4am on weekends . 
  on weekdays it 's usually quiet , but on weekends it 's packed with people aged ~ 16-30 . 
  summer is a special season in the austrian countryside and you have a lot of * kirtage/volksfeste * even in small towns . 
  they are like mini-oktoberfests with one or two tents and a few rides . 
  they usually last one weekend , and over the summer there 's always one happening within a 50km/30mile radius , always in different towns . 
  ____________________________________________________ and then there is vienna , a city of ~ 1.8 million . 
  the nightlife there is basically what you want it to be . 
  there are pubs , lots of clubs , very large discos/clubs ( ~ 4,000 people ) and depending on your style or mood , you go drinking beer with your buddies or go dancing to a club . 
  places vary a little in the crowd they attract , and you have clubs with cover charge , bouncers and dress code , but also alternative clubs , punk clubs and what have you . 
  there are also a few `` specialized scenes '' with various types of electronic music , like techno , drum and base , etc. 
  in those scenes you usually have a number of djs and organizers , that organize what we call * parties * in various clubs . 
  in the summer , they may also organize weekend-long festivals within ~ 1hour driving distance where people dance three days straight in some little quarry or by a lake . 
  that was my preferred style of nightlife . 
   also , parties at student dorms or at one of the universities are a fun and cheap way to go out when you 're a student . 
  ____________________________________ in the past ~ 15 years , large music festivals have also become more and more popular in austria , and there 's probably one every other weekend over the summer . 
  i 'm talking large rock festivals over one weekend with lots of famous bands like * metallica * , * green day * ( random off the top of my head ) and european bands . 
  you can google `` nova rock festival '' to get an idea . 
  without knowing the exact positions of all right wing parties in europe , afaik the consensus among them is to reduce the eu to a free-trade agreement and strip it of all political and judicial competence . 
  the parties i know of are more or less clear about this goal , but i 'm pretty sure behind the scenes they all agree on this . 
  so that would mean now european court of human rights , no legislative power of the eu-parliament ( or get rid of it all together ) , and definitely no further political integration and no european army . 
  the eu would in effect become a large nafta , with free trade between its members . 
  by the way , free trade with all eu members ( and others ) seems to be a goal of ukip as well , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  other than that , in austria there is a tiny `` party '' that runs in national and eu-elections that advocates for leaving the eu . 
  i think they 're called `` eu-austritt '' ( eu-exit ) or something and it 's their single issue , but they usually get less than 0.5 percent of the vote . 
  i 'm guessing such groups may exist in other countries , too . 
  here 's a [ list of national parks in austria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_parks_of_austria#national_parks ) . 
  mhm , not really sure how we compare to * all * of europe , but here are a few thought or observations of mine which may or may not be correct . 
  * r/askeurope is more left-leaning and more pro-eu than the average population . 
  there are a few more right-wing comments every now and then , but they get down-voted and the posters seem to give up after a while . 
  * compared to r/askanamerican , r/askeurope is younger on average . 
  i think it shows in the comments , the opinions and the actual content that people here a mostly < 35 , while in r/askanamerican i often read comments by older people with longer careers , families , or whatever comes in your 30s , 40s , etc. 
  * i guess you could say people here are more `` internationally oriented '' than the average european . 
  many people in austria , germany and i 'm assuming other countries use social media in their own language . 
  coming here , communicating in english on a worldwide site may be a statement in itself . 
  * more critical of us than average . 
  this part i still have n't quite figured out yet . 
  it seems like there 's above average criticism of the us here , but that * may * only be a weird reddit-dynamic where mutual trolling or inconsiderate comments lead to a kind of distrust over time . 
  anyway , i 've never seen a european treat an american badly irl so i do n't know why fights seem to be more common on reddit . 
  * more educated ` ? 
  not sure if true , but in our country sub , i think there are more people with higher education than the avg . 
  maybe the fact that most people here speak nearly flawless english means they are more educated than johann/janos/jose / jan average . 
   it creates a large labor force and hence drives down the wages making it possible for companies to save a tremendous amount on wage costs . 
  this is true from a business perspective but not really from a workers ' perspective . 
  depending on which perspective you value higher , it can be beneficial . 
   it further reduces traditional christian western culture by percentage and even militates against it . 
  therefore speeding up the dissolution of ` christendom 's ' remnants , habits , traditions , political leanings etc. 
  what ??? 
  we are secularizing on our own and definitely do n't need to further bring down the percentage of christians . 
  why would we ? 
  and even if you 're some radical atheist , how would it help to bring in mostly people who are on average much more religious than then local population ?? 
  this argument is complete bs . 
  ______________________________________________________________________ the one benefit it brings for countries like austria and germany is that we keep our populations from shrinking significantly . 
  both our countries have fertility rates < 1.5 , so unless be bring in new people , our populations/economies would shrink and very soon there would be a collapse of the pension systems . 
  find i a !, 
  we 'll take good care of her !, 
  make sure you visit asap !, 
  i 'm assuming this means something nice , so have an upvote and a great 2017 !, 
  yes , it 's super common for people to buy fireworks . 
  it 's very popular to light your own fireworks , both in the cities and in the countryside . 
  i do n't have a video camera at the moment , but here in vienna at 9 p.m. december 31 , the celebrations have already started . 
  i 'm hearing fireworks in < 1 minute intervals right now and they are all from private citizens . 
  sorry , fellow european . 
  i usually respect your comments , but in this case you 're wrong . 
   the us is not really any different from russia , it does what serves it 's own interests only . 
  everybody serves their own interest , but the us ' interest alligns with ours . 
   their wars in the middle east make us less safe . 
  how is that something an ally does ? 
  yes , they fucked up . 
  the us is not infallible . 
  however , they don '' t take chunks out of * european * countries and annex them .
