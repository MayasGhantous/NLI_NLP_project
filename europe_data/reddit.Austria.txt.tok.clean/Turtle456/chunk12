  ( i 'm obviously talking about crimea . ), 
  he 's most likely american , trying to bait us into saying things he can use in r/shiteuropeanssay . 
  the us is an ally , and you do n't have to agree with everything they do , but they 're still our best friend when it comes to global ( super ) powers . 
  according to imdb , it will air on german tv on 16 jan 2017 . 
  you could also try the mediathek on orf.at . 
  if the movie is n't online , i 'm pretty sure the documentary would be . 
  i do n't think european countries are particularly divided over the settlements specifically . 
  most governments that i know of consider the settlements to be illegal and have been doing so for decades . 
  as far as i know even the us , both under republican and democratic presidents , have urged israel to halt development of new settlements , which they have consistently ignored . 
  also , i am super supportive of the us ' move in the security council , because what netanyahu did last year , i.e. 
  speaking before congress against the specific wishes of the white house , was beyond despicable . 
  kudos to obama for returning this kick to the balls . 
   btw . 
  you can be a strong supporter of israel * and * be against the settlements . 
  support should never be unconditional and should include a certain amount of give-and-take . 
  i wish israelis could see this event for what it is , namely the result of netanyahu 's arrogance and terrible diplomacy , but being the right-winger that he is , he 'll probably manage to blame it on someone else . 
  oh , well ...  i find it disgusting that the united states was the only one to abstain from the vote . 
  i find it disgusting it has n't happened earlier . 
  coincidentally , a new tv-movie about hotel sacher will air on austrian tv some time this week . 
  it 's 2 parts and probably more about the hotel itself rather than drama between people staying there , but it could be interesting . 
  here 's the [ imdb-entry ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5672212 ) . 
  i think you could ask your question again in r/austria . 
  * ringstra\u00dfenpalais * is a great suggestion , but i think there might be more relevant tv-shows and movies about the era but i ca n't seem to remember any titles . 
   * still exist by next december well , the pessimist in me would hope the same for the eu . 
  the eu is not in the best shape at the moment , and i definitely hope things do n't get worse or maybe even get a little better . 
  * an improvement of the refugee situation meaning a reduction of the influx of new refugees to austria , germany , etc. 
  it seems like we 're at full capacity right now regarding the acceptance of refugees by the public , so we need some time to breathe right now . 
  * no terrorist attacks no-brainer . 
  * a stop or at least a slow down of the rise of the right i really think they are an existential threat to the eu and will definitely do more harm than good on a national level . 
  * more unity and less divisiveness in europe and worldwide this includes intra-european relations , eu relations with the us , turkey , and even russia , and so forth . 
  i sincerely believe it 's better for everyone to work together rather than everyone blindly acting in their self interest . 
  reported for ridiculing the terminator !, 
  [ here ] ( http://www4.lubw.baden-wuerttemberg.de/servlet/is/246031/ ) you go !, 
  coincidentally , i asked about websites that list all euro coins in r/coins not too long ago . 
  check it out : [ can someone recommend a website that lists all existing euro coins ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/5fscc6/can_someone_recommend_a_website_that_lists_all/ ) there 's also a sub r/eurocoins . 
  not sure how active it is , though . 
  yes , i just learned about those through a thread in r/coins . 
  tbh , i thought it was a fake . 
  what a weird denomination . 
  are they used widely in slovenia ? 
  i 'd love to have one , but afaik they 're only valid in slo , so i doubt i 'll ever come across one . 
  hey , fellow collector !, 
  every country has their own design of the coins . 
  in some countries , they have already changed , because new monarchs came to power . 
  in addition to those , the countries issue commemorative $ 2 coins as often as they please . 
  some countries have more of those , some countries less . 
  check out [ this website ] ( https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/coins/html/index.en.html ) for a complete list . 
  not exactly an invention , but i recently saw on german tv that a guy developed a formula to calculate the `` degree of beauty '' of a landscape/scenery . 
  it 's intended to be used when something large is supposed to be built , like a road , windmills or whatever . 
  if they have a choice of places to build it , they will now build it in the uglier spot , so as not to ruin the more beautiful spots . 
   the cluster is the prove ... for your mutterkreuz-worthy amount of children ... 
  beautifully said !, 
  i 'll say the way we view our * military * . 
  * ( germans , please correct me if i 'm wrong ) . 
  * germany is very reluctant to use its military abroad and it seems to be pretty underfunded . 
  it 's also not very common to show excessive pride in the military , and i 've seen reports on tv where french soldiers during joint military displays were `` negatively surprised '' that they were often accompanied by pacifist protests . 
  part of germany 's leaning towards pacifism my also be rooted in the peace movement from the cold war , though . 
  austria went neutral after wwii and the military is n't held in very high regard by a large portion of the population either . 
  similar to germany , there 's very little pride in it and many people decide to opt out of conscription and do civil service instead . 
  also , general * `` flag waving '' * is rare to non existent in both our countries . 
  this is definitely a `` swing in the opposite direction '' after the extreme nationalism of the third reich . 
  the name `` adolf '' is obviously out of fashion , and so are certain * traditional germanic names * . 
  whether this is a direct result of the nazis ' overemphasizing `` germanic traditions '' or whether it 's just a general trend , i 'm not sure . 
  however , we do have an extremely right-leaning politician who has ten children all with ultra-germanic names , which makes it quite obvious that she is a nazi at heart . 
  ime it 's not a very hot topic in austria , anymore . 
  in the 60s there were even some [ terrorist attacks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_tyrolean_secessionist_movement#bombing_campaigns ) by a secessionist movement , but ~ 1970 an [ agreement between austria and italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_south_tyrol#the_second_agreement ) was reached that gave them a certain degree of autonomy . 
  my personal experience with south tyrolians is that i had some friends in university , who i simply assumed were tyrolian ( austria ) because of their accent , but after two or three years of friendship found out that they were actually from south tyrol , so italian citizens . 
  i 'm from the east though , so i 'm not sure how big of an issue it is for the locals , particularly for tyroleans . 
  i have also heard what another commenter wrote that south tyrol is n't very eager to join austria these days , because they are doing very well economically and would lose their autonomy status as only a part of a regular austrian state . 
  and to expand on this : in formal speech or in newspapers , americans are often called `` us-amerikaner '' , pronounced oo-ess-amerikaner , i.e. 
  us-americans . 
  no , there is nothing of the sort here for high school students . 
  if kinds want to exercise , they join a sports club , usually soccer . 
  there is , however , conscription in austria , so all healthy males have to do 6 months of military service , of which you can opt out by doing 9 months of civil service . 
  about 50 % of people opt out . 
  there is also a special type of high school for people who are planning on a career in the military . 
  you get a high school diploma and are free to do whatever afterwards , but if you specifically want to join the military , you get a head start by going to that school . 
  it 's very rare though , and there are probably only 3 or 4 schools of that type in austria . 
   ok cool here 's a few questions for ya haha . 
  did n't expect that . 
    1 does austria just let germany take the blame for hitler or do you guys reconsider that he was born there and try to inform people ? 
  for many years we did let germany take the sole blame and we considered ourselves the `` first victim of german aggression '' . 
  this theory was supported by the allies in the [ moscow declaration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anschluss#moscow_declaration ) . 
  this was a convenient place for austria to be in until the 1980 's when we started to look at our history more critically . 
  today , austria recognizes that many austrian supported the nazi regime and committed crimes in wwii . 
  there are holocaust memorials , and the concentration camp in mauthausen documents many of those crimes . 
  we do n't take any responsibility for hitler 's rise , though . 
  that happened in germany , and the fact that he was born here does not make austria primarily responsible for wwii . 
  it does shed a light on antisemitism in austria before wwi and wwii , where hitler got his ideas . 
  the anschluss is a difficult topic . 
  it was forced on austria as our government at the time was strictly against it , but we do recognize that hitler had many supporters in austria . 
  we do n't deny that he was born in austria at all , but i do n't think it 's considered a massively important fact . 
  he could have been born anywhere and gone to germany to do what he did . 
  here 's a [ paragraph on wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anschluss#austrian_identity_and_the_.22victim_theory.22 ) about the `` victim theory '' post wwii . 
   2 why do all of you seem to dislike baggers in grocery store ? 
  we do n't `` dislike '' them , i guess , but it 's something we just do n't do . 
  we usually take the shopping cart to the car and then pack ourselves . 
  i do n't see why i would need someone to do it for me , and when we 're in the us it does seem a little weird . 
   it 's a bit like asking , why do n't american supermarkets have valet parking or free back rubs ...  3 thoughts on the european union after brexit and talk from other countries ?
