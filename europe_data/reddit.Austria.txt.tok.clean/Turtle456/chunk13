  i am very worried about the eu at the moment . 
  some 10 years ago , i feel like everybody felt positively about the eu and associated it with prosperity , stability , and peace . 
  this mood has changed a lot imo , and it seems like there are many countries who do n't seem to be so sure about it anymore . 
  right now , i think the worst case scenario is actually the eu falling apart , if many things go wrong in the next ~ years . 
  if right wingers take over france , austria , italy and netherlands , i think we are in serious trouble and they might do irreparable damage to the eu . 
  either way , i 'm glad that my parents have a house in the countryside on a big lot where we can grow enough potatoes for all of us , if everything goes to shit . 
    4 how do you 'll ( i know generalizing us bad ) feel about when americans pronunciation things differently i.e. 
  no biggy . 
  just sounds a little weird at first , but who gives a shit ?? 
  we also have loanwords from french and english and while we usually keep the original pronunciation , a native speaker would probably cringe . 
  the one word that annoys the hell out of me is louisville , which i refuse to pronounce in that awful way . 
   5 how is colonialism taught i know here it 's in a very negative manner ( yes even in regards to the philippines and cuba ) as with all the other answers , this is the * austrian * perspective - i ca n't speak for all of europe !, 
  colonialism is viewed and taught very negatively here and is basically seen as one huge crime . 
  austria never had colonies , so i guess it 's `` easier '' for us to point out the negative without having to take any blame for it . 
  i do n't think we ever learned about cuba and the philippines . 
  the us is not seen as a colonial power here , but rather as the ones pushing for an end to it post wwi/ii . 
   6 what 's some of your favorite craft beer ? 
  i still have n't figured out what craft beer is . 
  is it just microbreweries experimenting with new flavors ? 
  anyway , it 's not a thing here at all . 
  we have literally 100s or even 1000s of beers from breweries that have been around for centuries in europe , and we just drink those . 
  i think i heard that recently the first shop for craft beers opened in vienna , but it 's extremely niche . 
  the number one import beer in austria is [ czech budweiser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser_budvar_brewery ) . 
  myself , i usually buy a vienna brand or whatever is on special . 
  :d  7 when are second languages taught and when does teaching end for them ? do people use them on a regular basis ? 
  in austria , you start english in 5th grade and it 's taught until 12th grade . 
  ( or 9th grade , which is the end of school if you then start an apprenticeship to learn a trade ) . 
  in 9th grade you start a second foreign language , usually french or spanish . 
  in my type of school , we also had latin from 7th to 12th grade . 
  do we use them ? 
  tv and movies are dubbed here , so in the days before the internet , your average austrian was n't exposed to english * that * much . 
  i guess in western austria it might have been more if you worked in the tourism industry . 
  today , everybody who goes to school until 12th grade will speak somewhat decent english . 
  if you wan na be a professional or continue to university , english is sort of expected . 
   8 do you guys have animated adult stuff i do n't think i have seen anything animated ( be a tv show or movie ) from europe that 's strictly aimed at adults ? 
  do you mean porn ? 
  not that i know of , as i 'm not into that at all . 
  if you mean regular movies or tv-shows : not produced in austria . 
  our entertainment industry is tiny , as we 're only 8 million people and we get all the american and german stuff , and the odd european production . 
  there are some european animated movies i can think of , like asterix from france . 
  if you want to check out a german animated movie series , google `` werner beinhart '' - it 's from the 80s . 
  a few years ago , there was a german animated movie mocking old movies about the austrian emperors , the habsburgs . 
  here 's the [ imdb-page ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498525/ ) for it . 
  it 's pretty silly , and probably just as much for kids . 
  you could also check out [ this recent thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/57ttfd/could_you_give_examples_of_animated_films_that ) from this sub that was specifically about animated stuff from european countries . 
   a preemptive thanks just for looking at all these questions . 
  no prob . 
  hope i answered your questions . 
  i 'd say it 's seen as a significant event of wwii because it brought the us into the war . 
  however , our knowledge and education focuses so much on what happened in europe that the pacific theater is almost a side note in school books . 
  basically , we know about pearl harbor and hiroshima/nagasaki . 
  the rest is all about events in europe , since that was what affected us , our countries , and our grandparents . 
  i watch a lot of german tv , and for every documentary on the war in the pacific , there 's probably 20 + on europe and particularly the nazi regime and the holocaust . 
  i do n't think many people would know the exact date of pearl harbor , or any casualty figures about it . 
  it 's just the event that brought the us into the war . 
  personally , i think pearl harbor was an idiotic move from a strategic standpoint , because i do n't quite understand what the expected to gain from it . 
   i know that this sub hates it when americans ask thoughts on my country i do n't . 
  fire away . 
  also try r/germany . 
  lots of expats there . 
  r/german is for german language questions . 
  r/de is the german-language sub for germany , but it 's ok to post in english . 
  it 's probably your best bet if you want to find someone to hang out with in ottweiler and/or saarland . 
  good luck !, 
   ( this same girl traveled to england and could n't even name the capital ) geez , way to pick your sources . 
  :d ___________________________________________ regarding your question , i think the topless beaches stereotype is usually blown out of proportion . 
  yes , it 's legal in most places to go topless , but one average not more than maybe 5 % of women actually are topless . 
  it 's optional , and definitely not the norm . 
  here on reddit , i think some americans make too much of the hate-speech laws in european countries . 
  it sometimes seems they think we all have stasi or gestapo style `` speech police '' . 
  that 's not the case at all . 
  very few people actually get convicted for it , and it 's usually just a fine or a sentence on probation . 
  the only people actually going to prison fro hate speech or holocaust denial are repeat offenders with an agenda , who wo n't shut up after the n-th warning . 
  some of them seem to want to get convicted even to get `` martyr '' status in their radical circles . 
   btw i 'll hopefully be going to vienna this summer , first time abroad . 
  cool . 
  check out r/travel , r/austria or r/wien if you need advice or have any specific questions . 
  the name implies that they are from linz , austria . 
   i just ca n't quite figure out why she would make those cookies while my other grandmother would always make chocolate chip and things like that . 
  well , we just have christmas traditions that are different from the us . 
  we do n't make chocolate chip cookies at all , they are ( afaik ) quite uniquely american . 
  a typical plate of christmas cookies in austria and germany would look [ like this ] ( http://www.duden.de/_media_/full/w/weihnachtsbaeckerei-201020596482.jpg ) . 
  if you ever get a chance to try the other types , you should . 
  aldi would be representative of * discount supermarkets * , which is a special `` class '' of supermarkets . 
  they have a fairly large share of the market in germany ( afaik some 30 % ) . 
  in austria , discount supermarkets are not as popular - maybe 10 or 15 % . 
  and yes , they offer less of a `` convenient shopping experience '' , as they try to keep costs down wherever possible . 
  they also usually sell knock-off brands instead of the fancier ones . 
  `` regular '' european supermarkets are nicer than the discount ones , and ime roughly compare to us supermarkets , although they might be a little smaller on average , especially in cities where space is expensive and people usually are on foot . 
  baggers , however , do n't exists in european supermarkets that i know of , not even the nicer ones . 
  it 's just something we do n't do or expect . 
  i 'm not sure what you mean by the quarter deposit . 
  i do n't know of any deposits in discount supermarkets . 
  i 'd call that one `` rigged '' , though . 
  just to clarify : they are not used as permanent homes like in us trailer parks . 
  it 's just too cold in the winter in austria to live in a trailer . 
  but yeah , some people have caravans that they leave at their preferred campsite ( usually down south ) and they will live there over the summer months . 
  particularly popular among retirees . 
  mobile homes do n't exist in austria . 
  it 's all brick and mortar .
