  sooo hard to say what would happen . 
  it 's very rare here that people are armed , and those who are * and * resist police in any conceivable way are usually criminals . 
  whatever would happen though , a court would rule it as a justified response . 
  it 's extremely rare in austria that police get convicted for wrongful behavior or excessive violence . 
  most cops are alright , and deaths involving police are extremely rare , but * if * something happens , cops are usually acquitted . 
  i 'm pretty sure that includes burning , though . 
   by the may , afaik not just the austrian flag but flags of other countries as well . 
  i 've seen picture of police taking away a `` defiled '' flag of israel at an anti-israel protest . 
  in regard to op 's question :  i 'm wondering if people are regularly prosecuted for burning national flags in the eu ? 
  not in austria . 
  everybody just knows it 's forbidden so nobody does it . 
  there are about a million other ways to express protests . 
  also , demonstrations here are in most cases for or against a certain * issue * or * political party * . 
  very few people question the austrian state as such , so burning the flag would be nonsensical . 
  i have never heard of anyone claiming that burning the flag is an infringement of their freedom of speech . 
  it 's a complete non-issue here . 
  actually , way too many to name here . 
  `` movies '' and `` american movies '' is almost synonymous for me , as there are n't really that many german-language movies that i 'm interested in . 
  anyway , pulp fiction is probably my favorite . 
  matrix is great , terminator ii ( yes , flair checks out ) . 
  i 'm not terribly into old movies , but some like it hot , it 's a mad , mad , mad , mad world and the odd couple deserve a mention . 
  my overall favorite genre , is comedy , though . 
  some of my favorites are hot shots ( i+ii ) , the naked gun , airplane ! , the heat , horrible bosses , dumb and dumber , groundhog day , and soo many more . 
  not very common in austria and ( afaik ) `` aggressive begging '' is illegal in many places . 
  probably in the subway , too , because i 've seen it in other countries ( usually gypsies/roma playing music and walking through with a a cup ) , but never in austria . 
  it 's very common , however , for people to quietly beg in many places , eg . 
  near subway entrances , in front of supermarkets , or in pedestrian zones . 
  they 'll usually sit quietly with a sign . 
  most of them are also roma , and police calls it `` organized begging '' . 
  this means that some shady people bring busloads of roma from slovakia to closeby vienna and make them beg all day . 
  it 's very hard for the authorities to solve this issue . 
  people who live really close to the border , say , 15 minute drive , will sometimes get gas in other countries . 
  for many years in the 1990s it was worth it for us ( east austria ) to get gas in hungary . 
  my uncle would even get gas with his large van with a large gas tank , and then take the gas back out an use it in his everyday car . 
  it equaled about 3 full tanks . 
   today , i know that near the at-de border a lot of germans come to get gas in austria . 
  right now , in east austria we still go get cigarettes in hungary and a lot of people go there for `` labor intensive '' services . 
  haircuts , getting your nails done , dentist and even plastic surgery can be anywhere from one third to half the price in hungary . 
  the other way , hungarians come to work in austria and they commute daily . 
  austria has been governed by social democrats for much of the past 40 years . 
  i think our economic policies and the welfare state can be considered pretty left-wing . 
  socially , we 're a little more conservative . 
  in the cities everything is fine , but , for example , it took a `` supreme court '' decision to allow gay civil unions and adoptions by gay couples . 
  in parliament , the conservatives always prevented the passing of such laws . 
  in austria , 99 % of the people i know say * mac * donald 's . 
  in the us , with a native-speaker american accent , i 've heard it pronounced closer to mic . 
  ah , interesting . 
  any idea what the reasoning was to reduce the term length ? 
  that stuff just varies between countries and elected office . 
  in austria we used to have 4 years between parliamentary elections and recently changed it to 5 . 
  the argument for longer terms is that it 's more likely for the legislature to pass unpopular ( but necessary ) laws if they do n't have to constantly think about reelection . 
  in the us it 's a little more complicated . 
  while there are elections every two years , the term length of senators is 6 years . 
  they only reelect one third of the senate every 2 years . 
  i think the house is reelected in its entirety every 2 years , which i find way too short . 
  some presidential terms are even longer , for example france with ~ ~ 7 years ~ ~ 5 years ( til ) . 
  personally , i think 5 years is a pretty good term length for a parliament . 
  if you want to consider it an `` outside event '' , the collapse of the soviet union and the resulting fall of the iron curtain . 
  it brought 10 new members into the eu and ended the decade-long ( ideological and physical ) divide of europe . 
  ... pronounced almost exactly like their english/american counterparts . 
  i see . 
  so from an american standpoint it makes a lot of sense . 
  if thanksgiving is always on thursday , and people usually fly/drive/travel cross country to see family , i suppose a lot of people take the following friday off . 
  makes sense to make it a major shopping day . 
  since we do n't celebrate thanksgiving , it 's just a random thursday/friday for us . 
  we have something similar-ish on dec 8 . 
  it 's a national holiday ( not sure why ) and until ~ 10 years ago shops were also closed . 
  then the retail-lobby pushed through to keep shops open and now it 's a mayor shopping day . 
  there 's no discounts though and none of the black friday mayhem i 've seen in some stores in the us . 
  off topic , but i noticed your flair . 
  are you actually from monaco ? 
  that 's pretty cool !, 
  yep , it 's called [ twin city liner ] ( http://www.twincityliner.com/en ), 
  for the sake of completeness : austria participates in the nato partnership for peace program , and austrian soldiers were deployed in afghanistan along with other nato peacekeeping troops . 
  so we 're only sort of neutral , but i 'm 100 % ok with that . 
  no , i 've never seen it . 
  granted , i rarely watch tv-ads and do n't give out my phone number and email address so i might have missed it . 
  tbh , i do n't even know what `` black friday '' is . 
  it would make zero sense here , as it 's not a holiday or in any other way significant . 
  i figure it has something to do with thanksgiving ?? 
  in the us : `` ahh , [ sound of music ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_sound_of_music_ ( film \\ ) ) ! '', 
  * ( i still have n't seen it . 
  ) * outside of europe : `` ahh , australia , hahaha . '', 
  austria had the first `` successful '' populist right , the freedom party ( fp\u00d6 ) , and was the first country to to have them in the government after the [ 1999 election ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_legislative_election,_1999 ) . 
  it was quite a tumultuous time and the other eu members imposed sanctions on austria . 
  the fp\u00d6-members in the government were highly incompetent and they broke basically all their campaign promises . 
  this resulted in a split of the party , we had early elections and fp\u00d6 went from 27 % ( 1999 ) to 10 % . 
  since then they have been rising again , gaining ~ 5 % in each election . 
  at the moment , they are polling  30 % and are easily the strongest party in the country . 
  the next parliamentary elections are n't until 2018 , though . 
  also , we are currently in the midst of a presidential election , between a right-wing and a left-wing candidate ( green party ) . 
  the green party candidate won the election by a tiny margin a few months ago , but it was challenged ( minor irregularities ) and we will do a re-vote on dec 4 . 
  there 's a 50/50 chance of the right-winger winning . 
  edit : tl , dr : austria has one of the strongest populist right parties . 
   back to germany where we live in that case , you could open an account with a german bank . 
  the transfer portugal -  germany should n't be too expensive , as it 's within the eu . 
  you can then use the german account and a debit card to withdraw in australia . 
  tbh , i 've never had that issue . 
  i 've traveled a bit and always found it was cheapest to bring my bank/debit card and withdraw from atms wherever i went . 
  so far , this has worked everywhere .
