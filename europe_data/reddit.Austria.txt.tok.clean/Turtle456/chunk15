  i 'm surprised to hear `` his bank '' does n't allow international transactions . 
  i guess your best bet is * talking to his bank and get a different account type that allows international withdrawals . 
  * find another bank in portugal that allows it . 
  / r/portugal might be able to help you out . 
  * open an account with a non-portuguese bank that operates in portugal . 
  i 'm sure other european banks ( eg . 
  from spain ) operate in portugal so just look up their websites . 
  they probably will have an english version , too . 
  good luck . 
  i think the best place to ask this would be / r/mapporn . 
  afaik they have a `` weekly request thread '' , so just find that and try . 
  edit : yep , the [ request thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5dx9z4/official_mapporn_request_thread/ ) is stickied on their front page . 
  not an issue in austria and i suspect also not in germany . 
  it feels like i see at least one girl with hair like you described every time i go outside . 
  in medium to large cities , you wo n't stand out more than the locals with hair like yours . 
  it 's definitely not unheard of here . 
  we all know it has to be aramaic , the language spoken by our lord and savior jesus christ . 
  well , it 's not on the list of things i expect to see in my lifetime , that 's for sure . 
  we 're having enough trouble getting the currently 28 countries of the eu to agree on a lot of things . 
  to be honest , at the moment i think a european federation may only happen in the rather distant future , if at all . 
  i 'd expect a worldwide federation to be exponentially more complicated . 
  i would probably rather see larger blocks of culturally similar countries and maybe a reformed , but more powerful un to settle disputes between said larger blocks . 
  so there could be an african union , an arab or muslim union , a latin american union , south east asian union and so forth , and each is represented in a united nations council or something like that . 
  as others have said , race is n't as important here as in the us , and you are n't really forced to decide or identify as something . 
  that said , i think it 's almost universal that people will point out or emphasize `` the other '' element of someone . 
  for example , after wwii allied soldiers would engage in relationships with austrian women , and if a kid was born , it would often have the `` stigma '' of being `` that french kid '' or `` that russian kid '' . 
  it should be noted that in europe we ( used to ) differentiate between ethnicities that in the us would just be generalized as `` white '' . 
  that is becoming less of an issue ( or none at all ) since there are * many * international relationships these days between europeans from different countries and there 's no stigma to it any more . 
  ( in austria at least ) . 
  so i guess you could say the one drop rule exists/existed , but usually only for first generations . 
  so if someone was considered `` a russian child '' , i do n't think they 'd pass it on to their kids . 
  in case of an actual different race , where it might be visible more generations down , that might be different . 
  afaik , the situation is pretty similar all around the world , so a mixed race person ( white/asian ) in asia is considered `` white '' . 
  i 've also heard on a number of occasions that in latin america `` one drop '' of white makes you white . 
  sorry , my friend . 
  * my personal opinion * is that you are falling for their rhetoric . 
  they want the eu gone and want to return to nation states in europe . 
  i 'm sure your friends are n't racists or ultra-nationalists , but the far-right parties are . 
  they 're just not telling you the full story yet , because it does n't fly with the voters . 
  vote me down , if you want , but f *** all those right wingers . 
  if you fall for their populism , the eu is history . 
  * ( sorry , i had a bad day . 
  i did n't read your article , but i 've heard about this in some other media outlet . 
  i think the word `` sanctions '' is incorrect here . 
  it 's not about sanctioning . 
  the term i read was `` carbon tax '' or `` carbon tariff '' , meaning we would add a tariff to us-goods that violate the paris agreement . 
  i would absolutely support that , but i do n't see an actual chance of it happening . 
  eu-us relations are very delicate and i do n't think we 'd actually do it . 
  nobody wants a trade war or a diplomatic crisis with the us . 
   why are right wing movements generally eurosceptic ? 
  because they are * nationalists * . 
  as in `` we are the best '' , `` screw others . 
  '' , `` we want our * nation state back ! * . 
  nationalists typically look down on other nations , so they reject a union with them and do n't want to give them any rights in their own country ( like freedom of movement ) . 
   i would probably lean more on the right . 
  conservatives , i.e. 
  right in the spectrum , are pro-eu , because they want free trade and smaller government/state . 
   that being said , i consider myself a federalist . 
  then you should leave the far-right . 
  their ultimate goal is to destroy the eu . 
  period . 
  despite being landlocked , austria [ used to have a navy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_armed_forces#naval_squadron_.281958.e2.80.932006.29 ) that patrolled the danube river . 
   the squadron comprised two officers and thirty men . 
  the company which built the vessels closed in 1994 . 
  with the fall of communism and the inability to maintain and repair the vessels , the squadron was disbanded in 2006 . 
  i think he is talking about roma which are begging all over vienna . 
  for some reason , we always assume they are from slovakia , though . 
  they are very common in austria . 
  almost everybody will have one for baking cakes and pastries . 
  on the other hand , i 've never heard of anyone using it for `` health purposes '' the way you described , but that may be because i rarely discuss dieting with anyone . 
  i 'm not sure about austria , but i do n't think many people actually like putin . 
  i know the right wing somewhat admire putin , as they are leaning towards authoritarianism and are also anti-us . 
  however , i do n't think they 're very vocal about it . 
  generally , russia does n't have a very good reputation is austria , dating back to wwii . 
  the russian troops are generally seen as the worst of all occupying forces between 1945-1955 . 
  we also had the iron curtain on large stretches of our border , so there 's that ... also , russia today does n't broadcast in german , so i doubt a lot of people watch their propaganda first hand . 
  hey . 
  as my hungarian friend suggested , it 's a very ambitious itinerary , but generally , it 's doable , although i probably would n't recommend it . 
  i have done a trip like this using an interrail/eurrail pass when i was 19 . 
  at that age , the pace was ok and we got a quick , maybe superficial glimpse of many european cities . 
  however , i would n't do it like that again , and would probably decide on a smaller area , travel slower and visit cities that are closer to each other . 
  so i would either do central plus western europe , or just southern europe , or something like that . 
  also , keep in mind you 're visiting many iconic places with tons of history . 
  if you rush it too much an see too much , everything will become a blur by the time you get to rome , and you 'll be like `` meh , yet another old church ... '' . 
  so my advice would be to save one or two greater areas for another trip , and maybe visit smaller cities too , or give yourself 5-7 days in one place in the middle of your trip , just to rest a little . 
  if you want to stick to your itinerary , here 's what people in / r/travel would usually recommend for the cities you plan to visit . 
  you could take a day off of amsterdam , prague , venice , barcelona . 
  you could add a day in vienna , rome , paris , french riviera . 
  that would be an interesting question . 
  maybe something like `` how much and what type of internet content is available in your native language ? '', 
  plus a little explanation in the text ? 
  i can answer it for german : * all the major newspapers and news outlets have detailed websites , often with a forum and/or comment section , so you can get all your news in german . 
  * the public broadcasters are required to have much of their content available for streaming and video on demand . 
  the commercial channels also have a large video library . 
  * there is german content on youtube , and the major social media sites ( e.g facebook ) come in german ( and many other languages ) and german-speaking users obviously post in german . 
  * there are many specialized forums in german for tons of topics , like hunting , photography , hiking - you name it . 
  * wikipedia has lots of content in german . 
  hands down , no . 
  i 'm not anti-american in any way , but running elections is definitely not your expertise . 
  1 ) elections must be held on a weekend .
