  as many people as possible must have time to participate . 
  2 ) voter suppression laws . 
  it 's a thing while voter fraud is n't . 
  every person should be able to vote , including convicted felons . 
  3 ) information : many voters are not well informed . 
  there should be a law that requires the tv networks to inform voters in a neutral way . 
  4 ) voting machines : they do n't deliver much of a benefit and are manipulable . 
  voting should be done on paper so recounts can easily be done . 
  5 ) absentee ballots : in austria , absentee voting is becoming more and more popular . 
  you go to a website and they send you an absentee ballot weeks in advance . 
  you then mail the ballot . 
  there 's no need to show up on election day and you have about a month to get it done . 
  it 's super convenient . 
  no , dude !, 
  no offense , but you need to chill out . 
  the us is still the most powerful country in the world and good relations between europe and the us are essential to us . 
  we 'll never boycott or sanction you guys . 
  i do n't like trump , but let 's just wait . 
  you probably know better than us that the american government system has many checks and balances to prevent lunatics from running the country into the ground . 
  let 's keep faith in your political system . 
  personally , i 'm more worried about the republican congress and what they will do domestically . 
  it does n't affect us europeans , but i 'm afraid they 'll lower the taxes for the rich , repeal obamacare and really make life worse for many americans . 
  like i said , it wo n't affect me , but i think you guys should really be more concerned about domestic politics . 
  good luck , though . 
  a strong america is in europe 's interest and vice versa . 
  i hope trump wo n't fuck up your country too bad . 
   far-left not by european standards . 
  far-left here means being a communist or a punk ( as in dyed hair , rejecting capitalism altogether ) . 
  i 've always held strong social-democratic views , so i believe in high taxes and in return lots of public services and a good social safety net . 
  i 'm in my 30s now and still hold these views , and with the rise of the right in europe they are actually solidifying . 
  in a us-context , i 'd be a bernie-supporter or what you call `` progressive '' . 
   anti-american phase kinda yes . 
  i never hated the people or the country itself , but during the bush ii administration i was very critical of us foreign policy , particularly the iraq war . 
  it also coincided with my years in university , so i guess you could call that a phase in my early life . 
   how do you view your early political views ? 
  my views about the us changed back to * pro * during the obama years , and especially with russia 's aggression in eastern europe i 'm actually a big fan of america 's role as the sole superpower . 
  i think if the us retreated from europe or other parts of the world , some other power ( russia , china , etc ) would try to fill the vacuum . 
  i think a uni-polar world is more stable than a multi-polar one ( see cold war ) , and since europe ca n't be the superpower , i 'd rather it be the us than russia . 
  i also know much more about the us now and what forces are at play in us politics , so it 's easier to overlook or understand certain flaws . 
  let 's see what the trump presidency will bring . 
  imo you do n't need to worry about anything . 
  most europeans are able to differentiate between the us government and us citizens . 
  in my experience , most europeans like meeting americans and like asking them questions about the us . 
  the one thing that can happen is that people will start a political discussion and lecture you about american foreign policy , but i 'm 99,9 % sure you wo n't experience any open hostility . 
  especially once you tell people you do n't like trump either , they 'll probably buy you a drink . 
   i thought that was hilarious . 
  it is :d next best thing would 've been huge mittens that make it impossible to hold a beer bottle . 
  lol . 
   escaping from prison . [ . . ], 
  is not a crime , because it is considered that the desire for freedom is natural . 
  wow , that 's the most `` progressive '' law i 've ever heard of . 
  i 'll have to check if we have anything similar . 
   now that said , lots of places check ids at the door , but i believe that 's a way of mitigating the risk of serving alcohol to minors , not a legal rule in and of itself . 
  could be wrong . 
  yeah , that 's what i meant . 
  when i visited the us at age 18 i remember not being allowed into certain bars/clubs/etc . 
  i tried to argue that i just was n't going to drink alcohol , but they would n't let me in anyway . 
  in portland they also had a thing called `` underage clubs '' which i guess did n't serve alcohol , so i kind of assumed that a liquor license automatically meant no minors allowed . 
  it was so long ago , though . 
  i 'm not sure whether it 's a law or they just do it that way . 
  might vary between states , too , i suppose . 
  i know it 's just the networks , just was n't sure whether it 's an actual law passed by congress or just a rule set by the fcc you have to comply with otherwise x happens . 
  kinda like the drinking age is n't a federal law , you just loose the highway funding . 
  anyway , ianal . 
  * drinking in public . 
  * bad language on tv . 
  ( not sure if that 's an actual law in the us ) . 
  * smoking in cafes/restaurants . 
  ( will be prohibited in 2018 . ), 
  * drinking age is 16 , but not even that is enforced . 
  * kids are allowed into places that sell alcohol . 
  * prostitution . 
  * gambling and betting . 
  * edit : age of consent is 14, 
  it actually starts earlier in europe than in the us , because we do n't have thanksgiving that 's `` holding them back '' . 
  i checked , the [ christmas markets ] ( http://imgur.com/qrvazy0 ) in vienna open november 11 . 
  i think malls start decorating at some point in mid-november , and i 'd expect christmas music at the latest by end of november . 
  well , if you have amsterdam plus `` some cities in eastern europe '' already planned , i 'd just throw in berlin and that 's probably enough . 
  eastern europe i assume will be prague plus one or two more , so you have 4 or 5 cities which should be good for 14 days . 
  * please tell me you will do a little more research aside from this post , before taking a whole group of people to europe ...  *, 
  tl , dr : * tv and radio * are dominated by public broadcaster orf , and they provide high quality programming . 
  there are no significant private channels with a political agenda . 
  besides the austrian channels we get all german and some swiss channels . 
  the newspaper market is dominated by a single tabloid-ish paper that leans right-wing/populist which likes to flex its muscles towards politicians to gain influence and advertising money . 
  their dominance in the market is often criticized . 
  ______________________________________________________________________ ** tv : ** our public broadcaster is orf . 
  they have 2 regular channel , 1 documentary and 1 sports channel . 
  they are well funded and the `` main source '' of television news and information . 
  besides that we have 4 private channels mainly focused on entertainment . 
  they do n't do much news and do n't have a political agenda , although one of them is ( more or less ) against the right-wing populists . 
  * ( besides the austrian channels , we get all channels from germany and the public broadcaster from switzerland ( srf ) * ** radio : ** also dominated by orf - they have 4 channels with a different target audience . 
  \u00d61 is like npr , \u00d62 are the local channels for each state targeting pensioners , \u00d63 is mainstream pop-music for a young audience , and fm4 is the `` alternative youth station '' with non-mainstream music . 
  ** newspapers : ** austria has a newspaper called [ kronen zeitung ] ( https://www.krone.at ) . 
  it has some 60 % market share which is ( afaik ) the largest share of a single paper worldwide . 
  it 's somewhere between a `` real '' paper and a tabloid . 
  it does n't have a party affiliation , but is definitely right-leaning and usually write what the `` guy down at the pub '' likes to read . 
  short articles , simple explanations and conclusions , often an `` us vs. them '' mentality , like towards the eu . 
  their main agenda seems to be `` profit and influence '' and they love to get politicians to suck up to them . 
  other than that , we have a few not so bad newspapers , some [ left-leaning ] ( https://derstandard.at ) , some [ conservative ] ( http://diepresse.com ) . 
  yes , polack is ( as far as i can tell ) offensive .
