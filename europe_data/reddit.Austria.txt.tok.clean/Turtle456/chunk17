  coincidentally , we have the same in german . 
  * pole * or female * polin * is the proper word . 
  * polack * is the old term and very offensive . 
  very informative !, 
  thank you !, 
  here are the correct terms for austria : 1 . 
  a person ( m/f ) from austria is an * austrian * . 
  the language is * german * . 
  the adjective is * austrian * , e.g. 
  * an austrian product * . 
  austria is n't exactly a very significant country on the world stage , but i 'll answer anyway :  1 ) attempt the deportation of millions of illegal immigrants it would depend on who is in our government . 
  it seems like after the next parliamentary elections we might have a right-wing chancellor and he would most likely applaud the us . 
  assuming a center-left government , they 'd probably say the disagree with the decision , but would say it 's a `` domestic affair '' so it 's the us ' decision . 
  we do n't have particularly close relations with latin american countries , so i doubt we 'd take a strong anti-us position . 
   2 ) trade war with china we and the whole eu would probably oppose it as it would cause economic disruptions throughout the world . 
  i do n't think a recession in china is in europe 's or anyone 's interest . 
   3 ) leaving nato austria is n't part of nato , so at first it would n't affect us . 
  however , it 's likely that afterwards the eu-countries would have to create a nato-like european military alliance and we would have to rethink our current neutrality . 
   4 ) responding to iranian provocation on the sea with deadly force . 
  we would definitely oppose that , as we usually do with any war . 
  for the time being , we 're neutral so we definitely would n't join any us-iranian war . 
  also , the iran deal was negotiated in vienna , so we 'd probably try to call for peace and offer to have new negotiations here . 
  can only speak for myself and no , i do n't think the us contributed little . 
  being the grandchild of austrians in the russian occupation zone of austria , i can also say may grandparents were very happy that we had * all * allies in austria and did n't end up in the warsaw pact . 
  regarding pacific theater : that 's something europeans think very little about so i 'm sure the comment in / r/askanamerican was just regarding the war in europe . 
  it 's up do you and an * american * decision . 
  if you think firearms are important to `` being american '' and the `` american spirit '' , then so be it . 
  we have other things that americans might find stupid . 
  like a drinking age of ~ 14 years , or legal weed ( holland ) , or an age of consent of 14 years ( austria ) . 
  if you think guns are important , have at it . 
  every society has its quirks , and if firearms are your thing , i can live with that . 
  i 'm late to the thread , but i do n't think there 's anything `` stupid '' about the us . 
  europe and us , we have some differences , but in the end we are closer to each other than other world regions . 
  personally , i hate the reddit-war between us and eu . 
  anyway ... 
  they us ai n't stupid and the eu ai n't stupid . 
  if you wan na find something stupid , look at the gulf states or some other backwards region . 
  eu and us are pretty similar ... the devil is in the details . 
  aww , that 's so cute !,

  eros ramazotti was big here a decade or two ago . 
  it 's cheesy love songs ( afaik ) but some are kinda catchy . 
  check him out , i 'm sure there 's stuff on youtube . 
  i 'd like to add , ime wwi is 98 % overshadowed by wwii is austria 's `` public conscience '' . 
  especially in the last 30 years austria 's involvement in wwii has dominated the public debate . 
  i almost want to say wwi is forgotten here . 
  i get most of my historical knowledge from austrian and german documentaries and it seems like for every documentary on wwi there 's 20 or more on wwii . 
  it 's just the much bigger issue here , especially the holocaust . 
  official memorials or `` memorial events '' are also 90 % anniversaries of wwii events . 
  we have `` made peace '' with [ emperor francis joseph i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_joseph_i_of_austria ) and the whole monarchy and it was heavily romanticized ( and exploited for tourism ) since ~ 1950s . 
  edit : i should also note that wwii is so much closer because many of us know actual veterans or eye-witnesses of wwii . 
  all my grandparents were in their 20s in wwii , so my grandfathers fought and my grandmothers suffered . 
  wwi is just one more generation away and while my grandma told me about her father being a pow in russia , there just is n't that personal and immediate connection . 
  that 's [ an easy pick ] ( http://imgur.com/9wbqvoz ) ladies and gentlemen , we have a winner , due to superior weaponry and general invincibility !, 
  congratulations to austria !,

  / r/travel has this [ guide to foreign sim cards ] ( http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/prepaid_sim_with_data ), 
   but it 's expensive i 'm not an expert , but i would expect this game to be sold out months ahead of time . 
  you might have to take what you can get . 
  also , try x-posting in / r/soccer and/or / r/barcelona . 
  might be more suitable for this question . 
  maybe it 's some sort of digital performance art ... let 's keep an open mind , guys !, 
  it 's not illegal in austria , quite the contrary . 
  there 's a company called [ bitcoinbon.at ] ( https://www.bitcoinbon.at ) that officially sells bitcoins . 
  you can buy bitcoin at numerous participating tobacco stores . 
  ( check their website for [ a map of stores ] ( https://www.bitcoinbon.at/outlets/ ) ) . 
  you pay in cash and they give you a receipt with an alphanumeric code . 
  you then go to their website , input the code and your bitcoin address and they transfer the bitcoins . 
  alternatively , you can buy bitcoins from other websites using money transfer . 
  there are a number of brick-and-mortar businesses in vienna that accept bitcoin ( using a phone app , iirc ) , like cafes and restaurants . 
  i 've never used it , but afaik some online retailers accept bitcoin , too . 
  i have never been carded in my teenage life in austria in the 1990s . 
  since then , they have become a little more strict because there were a few cases of very young teens being taken to the hospital with alcohol poisoning . 
  so i 'm seeing more signs in supermarkets that say `` no alcohol under 16 '' , but i have no idea if they actually card . 
  either way , you 'd always find ways to buy alcohol , because definitely not every place cards . 
  if you could n't get it in one place , just try another one and eventually you 'll get it at a gas station or from a street vendor . 
  i have never seen anything like it in austria , and we do get really cold winters . 
  what exactly are they for ? 
  just to protect the car from snow or frozen windshields ? 
  or are they connected to the garage so you can get in your car without having to go `` outside '' ? 
  i think in austria it 's pretty much the same as in germany . 
  when i was a kid ( 1980s ) , halloween did n't exist here at all . 
  we would only see it in american tv-shows . 
  in the 90s , stores started selling halloween-themed candy , tv channels started showing halloween-episodes all week ( e.g. 
  the simpsons ) and bars/pubs started having halloween parties . 
  i think halloween parties are pretty frequent now , but i 'm not sure if trick-or-treating is a thing for children . 
  i do n't think anyone decorates their house , unless you had a party at your house . 
  yes !, 
   and a lamp/latern procession with singing . 
  it 's [ children of kindergarten or elementary school age ] ( http://www.kitaregenbogen.de/07_archiv/14_laternenumzug/02_laternenumzug.jpg ) . 
  they usually make the lanterns themselves with their teachers . 
  in austria , english songs dominate the charts by a lot . 
  there is often a debate that the largest public radio station ( \u00d63 ) should push more music by local artists , but they deny favoring english music . 
  there was a time in the 70s/80s when a lot of austrian artists were successful ( austropop ) but these days are long gone . 
  many contemporary austrian artists also write english songs because it 's the only way to be successful outside of at/de/ch .
