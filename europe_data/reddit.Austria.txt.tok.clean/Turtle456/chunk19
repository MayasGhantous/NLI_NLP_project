  parties that represent ethnic groups are definitely a subpar solution , as can be seen in lebanon or bosnia & hercegovina . 
  my second argument against a `` muslim party '' would be that in our european mindset we do n't want religion to interfere with politics ( and vice versa ) . 
  personally , i do n't believe that religion is a great way to organize public life , because they are inherently unable to compromise . 
  third , i really think that it might further the social divide between `` natives '' and immigrants in many european countries . 
  an active muslim party would definitely turn more voters to right-wingers , who could then claim that `` muslims are trying to take over '' . 
  so tl , dr : yes , they could start a muslim party in my country , but i really hope they do n't . 
  i do understand your concerns and it makes sense to try to apply the lessons learned from the 1930s , but personally , i do n't think we 're headed for anything like nazi-germany . 
  * crosses fingers * i would be worried when right-wing , authoritarian parties have taken over much of europe and start passing discriminatory laws against minorities and somehow manage to `` pull a putin '' in their countries , effectively suspending democracy and the rule of law . 
  i would consider `` getting out '' when violent acts against minorities become socially acceptable , and police starts turning a bling eye and courts start acquitting the perpetrators . 
  can confirm . 
  never seen them in austria . 
  i 've always seen them as `` uniquely american '' . 
  i may have had one a long time ago in the us but do n't remember anything about the taste . 
  just from looking at them , i 'd suspect they 're almost pure sugar , without a very distinct taste . 
  am i wrong ? 
   the concept of having border posts everywhere is completely foreign not really . 
  between european countries it used to be just like between the us and canada or the us and mexico . 
  it was an international border , there were border posts , and police and customs were present at all times . 
  technically . 
  you would have had to show your passport every time , but in practice it varied depending on the specific border you were crossing . 
  for example , between austria and germany , the checks would have been very lenient and most of the time police would just wave you through . 
  on the other hand , between austria and hungary ( former eastern europe ) the checks would have been more thorough in the 1990s , and they 'd look at your passport , look in your trunk and possibly look inside car , because people would often smuggle cheap stuff from hungary to austria ( mainly cigarettes and alcohol ) . 
  as the schengen agreement ( no borders ) came into effect and hungary was about to join it , border checks gradually became more lenient and they would only check every 50th car or whoever looked `` suspicious '' to them . 
  when hungary joined schengen , the check stopped , and about 5 years later they started to demolish most of the border facilities . 
  at some border crossing , some of the facilities might still be there , because countries have the right to reinstate border checks for a limited time when necessary , such as major sports events ( euro 2008 ) , the recent refugee crisis or the g7 summit in bavaria in 2016 . 
  here 's a [ recent thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/50epqv/what_were_your_countrys_borders_like_preschengen/ ) you could check out , with a pretty similar question . 
  in austria , it 's very popular , although we rarely cook a whole turkey like americans do for thanksgiving . 
  since it 's poultry , many consider it to be healthier than pork or beef . 
  there are lots of [ turkey farms like this ] ( https://www.ndr.de/info/sendungen/puten104_v-contentgross.jpg ) in my area . 
  and no , in austria they do n't exist in the wild . 
  i grew up in the countryside and yes , quite a few people have dogs . 
  many have them as guard dogs , some for hunting . 
  usually the larger breeds , like german shepherds or similar . 
  it 's not common to take your dog everywhere , though . 
  the difference to american suburbia ( ime ) is that we have larger gardens that are fenced off , so dogs have enough space to run around and do n't have to be in the house , even when left alone . 
  in the cities , i see more smaller breeds , like lapdogs . 
  i will only comment on the austrian options : 1 ) do n't expect snow in vienna , but generally , it 's a nice city to visit if you 're into historical sights or museums . 
  2 ) styria is a province , so it depends on where exactly , but there are some skiing resort towns where you could expect snow . 
  ( you do n't have to ski at all . 
  many of them are pretty little towns and you can go for extended walks or take the lift up the mountains even without skis . 
  it 's very nice ! ), 
  schladming is a resort i can think of , but i 'm sure there are more . 
  ( maybe a fellow countryman can help ... ), 
  ours is / r/aeiou . 
  it 's an acronym that was used during the austrian empire and it means * alles erdreich ist \u00d6sterreich untertan * ( * the entire globe/world is austria 's subject * or in other words * austria stands above all other countries . 
  * ) i only recently joined , but we often just post pics of austrian products ( beer , candy , etc ) with `` upvote if you like ... '' , pics of austria , mfw-posts , or [ statues of arnold schwarzenegger ] ( http://imgur.com/c5lu9bb ) . 
  :d what 's special about it is that we write mostly in our local dialects , so anyone other than austrians and bavarians might have trouble following what 's being said . 
  speaking for austria : no , not at all . 
  even as a regular citizen ( male ) there 's not a single neighborhood or street in the whole country i would n't go to , at any time of the day or night . 
  claiming that police is unwilling to go somewhere is completely ridiculous . 
  well , it depends on what time scale you 're looking at . 
  if you look at day-to-day politics and current events , i agree with you . 
  also because russia under putin seems to think in old east-west terms and sees the us as it 's `` main rival '' . 
  that 's what i meant by `` the are n't sure about it '' . 
  but you could say the same about poland and hungary atm , as they have quite authoritarian-leaning , anti-liberal governments at the moment . 
  however , i was more thinking about a larger historical scale and russia is culturally and historically part of europe . 
  so imho they are part of the west , they just do n't know it yet . 
   give it a few decades , and they 'll get it , just like most of ( former ) eastern europe got it . 
  yes , absolutely . 
  i consider all of europe , plus us , canada , australia and new zealand `` the west '' . 
  culturally , politically and historically . 
  i also think russia is part of the west , even though they themselves might not be 100 % sure of that atm . 
  personally , i 'd also add israel , although that may be debatable . 
  no , austrian is not a language . 
  officially , we speak [ austrian german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_german ) , which is a * variety * of standard german , similar to american and british english . 
  the dialects are a different story , where the austrian dialects are part of the [ central austro-bavarian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_bavarian ) dialect group . 
  the dialects in austria are only colloquial , though , and are rarely used on tv or in formal situations . 
  ( this is in contrast to swiss german in switzerland , who do use it in formal conversation , too . ), 
   i never even considered that austria exists and speaks german as well . 
  you tryin ' to trigger me , or what ? 
  in austria , 2 kisses ( 1 left , 1right ) are very common between friends of the opposite gender , or between girls/women . 
  it 's not common between guys , and also not common between people who just met . 
  if i was in a similar situation , i 'd choose portugal . 
  it 's a beautiful country , cheaper than much of western europe , and you get a bit of the mediterranean lifestyle ( at least that 's how it felt to me ) . 
  and the language should n't be impossible to learn , either . 
  in austria it 's the [ state of vorarlberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vorarlberg ) in the very west . 
  their dialect is n't part of the austrian/bavarian dialect group , but rather one of the [ swiss german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_german ) dialects . 
  as an austrian ( other than from vorarlberg ) you are very rarely exposed to it except through swiss tv-channels . 
  south east asia has a lot going for it . 
  i love the tropical climate , it 's cheap , the people are friendly and i absolutely love the food . 
  i 'd probably be based in thailand and travel as much as i can to surrounding countries . 
  i would also like to live in an english speaking country for a while , and australia would be my first choice . 
  i have yet to meet an australian who is n't fun to hang out with . 
  i 'd also like to live in the us again , but probably only for a limited time . 
  i 'd love to travel the us as much as possible . 
  tl , dr : anywhere where it 's warmer than in austria , preferably the tropics . 
   used to be popular taking a road trip around scandinavia with a camper , yep , that 's what my family did some 20 years ago . 
  we drove to the north cape . 
  up through sweden and a bit of finland , down through norway . 
  i remember endless drives through forests . 
  to add to this : the [ historic city center of vienna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/innere_stadt ) is a [ unesco world heritage site ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_heritage_site ) . 
  it 's not allowed to build over 70m in the center , or else we would lose that unesco status . 
  really depends on where you 're going and what type of vacation it is : ** interrail/eurrail ** : the infamous `` backpacking through europe '' is usually young people who get an interrail train ticket that is valid across europe . 
  they would typically visit cities that are easily accessible by train and stay in hostels . 
  ** beach holiday : ** if it 's a family of 4 and the drive is feasible , people take the car from central/western europe to countries like italy or spain . 
  if it 's just a couple or young people going on a party vacation , they typically fly to the greek islands or the belearic islands ( ibiza , mallorca ) . 
  ** all inclusive resorts : ** these are becoming more and more popular as they are fairly cheap . 
  it 's often a package deal that includes the flight . 
  turkey is a popular destination . 
  ** city trips : ** short weekend trips to cities are quite popular , too .
