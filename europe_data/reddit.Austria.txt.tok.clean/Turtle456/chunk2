  lisbon is a personal favorite but it 's a bit out of the way . 
  no need for an `` anchor baby '' . 
  if you marry a local , it 's very easy to get a residency permit ; you even have a right to it ( at least in austria , but afaik it 's similar in other eu countries ) . 
  afaik they sometimes do checks whether it 's a `` real '' or `` fake '' marriage but if you move in together that 's enough to be recognized as `` real '' . 
  since you plan to have an actual partner you 'll have no problems convincing them it 's a real marriage . 
  also , as an american you would n't be a prime suspect for a fake marriage , since you 're not coming from a poorer country . 
  i 'm anything but an expert on the labor market but i keep hearing that stem-fields ( called mint in german : mathematik , informatik , naturwissenschaften , technik ) are always in demand . 
  also , germany generally has low unemployment and a shrinking population , so finding a job there should n't be too difficult in the foreseeable future , although their dual education system ( apprenticeship ) might make it a little difficult to work in the trades . 
  anyway , check out r/germany . 
  it 's in english and there 's many expats , so maybe someone can point you in the right direction there . 
  / r/iwantout might also be useful . 
  good luck !, 
  my family made it through the war relatively well , despite both my granddads being drafted into the wehrmacht . 
  one was a paratrooper in norway , the other was in a tank unit , but because he worked in an office before the war he ended up in an office in the army as well , basically typing up letters and reports for the unit 's commander . 
  * my grandpa was captured by the british the day after germany surrendered and put in a pow-camp in northern germany . 
  the guards in the camp were polish men , who had been freed from german concentration camps , and they obviously did n't treat the germans too well . 
  nothing horrible , but some physical abuse and they made them clean out the toilets with their bare hands and stuff like that . 
  my grandpa was there for almost one year . 
  * my grandma 's sister was engaged before the war and her fiance was killed . 
  after the war , his parents `` adopted '' her , she took his last name and never married . 
  * my grandma lived in a small town with * lots * of military industry . 
  after vienna , it was the town that saw the most bombing raids in austria , 13 iirc . 
  she survived them all either in the nearby forest or in a bunker in town , depending on where she was at when the planes came . 
  * when the red army approached east austria some civilians were afraid of them and fled to the west together with the retreating wehrmacht . 
  one of my grandma 's colleages from work was in one of those fleeing groups , a mix of civilians and german army . 
  along the way , the were bombed and her daughter was hit , lost both her legs and bled to death in her mother 's arms . 
  * one of my grandma 's schoolmate 's father was a high-ish ranking nazi . 
  after the wehrmacht had already retreated he and a bunch of other fanatics started an `` improvised '' court and `` convicted '' and executed people who they considered traitors or deserters - all when everybody knew the war was already lost . 
  he was later convicted of war crimes by an austrian court and was hanged,

   in my opinion the hijab or any other religious wear has no place in any public schooling facility . 
  it 's a fair position , but in austria it 's different . 
  we still have a cross in every classroom ( just a simple one without jesus ) along with a photo of the president as a symbol of the state . 
  until maybe two decades ago , this was n't even an issue because in most schools outside of large cities 98 % of kids were christian anyway . 
  nowadays , you have more atheists and obviously muslims ( and the odd `` other '' ) , but very few people fight for getting rid of the cross . 
  personally , i really do n't care and i do n't see it as an oppressive or offensive symbol , so i do n't want to bother traditionalists with that issue . 
  it would only be used by the right wing to push their `` our culture is under attack '' narrative . 
  we also have religious education ( re ) in school ( two hours per week ) - every child according to their religion/denomination . 
  ( atheists can simply opt out ) the main argument for having the state organize re is that you can set an official curriculum , set quality standards for teacher 's education and not leave it to some unknown priest/imam in some obscure church/mosque . 
  re also includes learning about all other religions besides your own . 
   how does homeschooling work in austria ? 
  is it any good ? 
  i do n't know much about it , except that the child has to take tests/exams at the end of each semester/school year at a public school to make sure they know what 's in the official curriculum . 
  it 's really rare , though , and i only ever met one child who was partially homeschooled , because her parents ran a circus so they would move around a lot . 
  if they stayed in a place a longer time , she would attend the local school for a few weeks . 
  other than that , it 's mostly ultra-religious christians who do it to protect their kids from `` evil influences '' , but again , it 's very rare . 
  since they have to take state exams i assume they get a decent education , but personally i think you are harming your child more than helping them . 
  you ca n't shelter them from society their whole life and their `` culture shock '' will be even harder when they first enter society at age 18 . 
  but then again , if you 're raised by religious nuts your chances of leading a normal life ( by my standards ) are pretty slim anyway ... 
  this is the best explanation for v4 's position so far . 
  nobody could seriously argue against that . 
   ( which is obligatory in france if you are minor ) same in austria , but muslim girls here do wear a hijab , sometimes as early as elementary school . 
  banning the hijab in schools is n't really discussed here , but i think it would be an interesting `` experiment '' to see if muslim women would start wearing it at 15 ( after school ) by choice , rather than their parents making them at a much younger age . 
  we also have the option of homeschooling , but i doubt the majority of ( working class ) muslims would be able to successfully homeschool their children , let alone in german . 
  so muslim girls/women do n't wear headscarves in schools ? 
  does that cause problems with very religious people who insist their daughters wear it from a young age ? 
  charlize theron ai n't bad , so that . 
   seriously , though , i think blonde is a thing here , although i might be biased . 
  here are the [ finalists for miss vienna 2017 ] ( http://www.vienna.at/miss-vienna-wahl-2017-das-sind-die-finalistinnen/5251867 ) . 
  more than half of them have slavic names , so i guess we 're doing alright regarding immigration . 
   the `` big ass '' - thing i keep seeing in the us is not a thing here , imo . 
  i 'm not in r/europe much , but i * love * r/askeurope . 
  i do n't know if my opinion of people `` changed '' but i 've learned a lot of little details here . 
  it also shows me that there is a crowd out there that thinks `` european '' which i find very comforting and it gives me a little hope with all the crap that 's going on with the eu atm . 
  r/askeurope and r/austria are considerably more left leaning than the general population . 
  i think you would find a similar demographic irl in cities ( particularly vienna ) and among university graduates . 
  your average 60-year-old austrian farmer is not represented on reddit , but like u/idkfa _ cz said , i also try to answer questions as unbiased as i can . 
  are you exaggerating or did you do a poll ? 
  r/austria is generally left leaning , too , but maybe not that much . 
  an austrian company , [ eli ] ( https://www.elitransport.at/blog-1 ) produces [ this electric utility vehicle ] ( https://imgur.com/a/j8dxn ) . 
  i do n't know wth is wrong with their website . 
  it barely works on any browser for me and i had to make screenshots and put them on imgur just to be able to show you a few pics of it . 
  anyway , according to [ this article in german ] ( http://steiermark.orf.at/news/stories/2832413/ ) , they are currently producing 1000 units per year and are hoping to expand to 2000 by 2019 . 
  their target group are municipalities that need it for roadwork , park maintenance , snow plowing , etc - basically what 's shown in the pictures . 
  well , my fellow countrymen have given you so many tips so i 'm just going to suggest r/wien ( that 's vienna ) . 
  check out the wiki , maybe subscribe and browse the posts a few weeks/months back . 
  questions like yours come up from time to time and imho it 's worth looking through the older posts . 
  ( do n't worry , the sub is n't terribly active , just a few posts a day ) . 
  maybe r/munich and r/prague are worth checking out , too . 
  ps : for an authentic vienna cafe experience i recommend `` cafe r\u00fcdigerhof '' ( address : hamburgerstra\u00dfe 20 ) also , [ atlas obscura ] ( http://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/vienna-austria ), 
  `` german precision '' . 
  in austria , i 'd say it 's [ gem\u00fctlichkeit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gem%c3%bctlichkeit ) , which we share with bavaria ( and possibly other parts of germany , but it 's not something i 'd associate with northern `` prussian '' germany ) . 
  the wikipedia article is pretty detailed , but personally i 'd translate it with `` relaxed-ness '' , `` chilled-ness '' or `` valuing the more enjoyable things in life '' in a work-to-live sense . 
  we also have `` raunzen '' , which is austrian slang for `` whining , complaining '' which is often used to describe our mentality . 
  in austria , if you say `` ein bier bitte '' it 's usually assumed that you want a half liter . 
  sometimes the waiter double-checks . 
  a half liter is called `` kr\u00fcgel '' ( literally means ` small jug ' ) , `` halbe '' ( ` half '' [ liter ] ) , or `` ein grosses [ bier ] '' ( ' a large [ beer ] ' ) . 
  you can also order a `` seitel '' or `` ein kleines '' ( ' a small one ' ) , which is 0.33 liters . 
  sometimes a bottle is also an option , then it 's `` in der flasche '' ( ` in a bottle ' ) . 
  i 'm austrian , and i love it . 
  it 's definitely a niche channel and ca n't compete with other channels in terms of viewer numbers but it 's definitely popular with ( left-leaning ) educated people . 
  we have another channel ( 3sat ) which is a joint-venture of austrian , german and swiss public tv . 
  also great programming . 
  i 'd love to see more such cooperations , maybe with some countries of former eastern europe or italy . 
  sure . 
  better safe than sorry , and horses would decrease our carbon footprint . 
  great idea !, 
  in austria , there is the [ seegrotte hinterbr\u00fchl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seegrotte ) . 
  it 's a cave system with the largest underground lake in europe , on which you can take a boat .
