  since cars are a hassle in many european cities , you 'd usually fly , or take the train if it 's not too far . 
  ** camping : ** is quite popular in certain countries . 
  people either have [ caravans ] ( http://www.caravantimes.co.uk/photo/dethleffs-caravans-$7073776$326.jpg ) or [ rvs ] ( http://www.fast-alles.net/pictures/422189.jpg ) . 
  a popular destinations for austrian campers is italy , where people just spend most of the time on one campsite . 
  however , there are campsites everywhere in europe , and i 've taken rv trips to germany , romania , bulgaria , greece and scandinavia . 
  those would be the euro version of a road trip , where you go far and stay on a different campsite every night . 
  ** winter/skiing : ** most people i know ( and from what i see ) take the car . 
  some people might come by train and rent the equipment at the resort . 
   if all options were the same price , which would you choose ? 
  to visit cities , i 'd fly or take the train . 
  to visit countryside , i 'd take my car or an rv , depending on the mood . 
  curious : is this popular with a majority of the people ? 
  are people really * that * catholic still in poland ? 
  red bull . 
  ( originally from thailand , but the red bull brand known worldwide is austrian . ), 
  also , [ doppelmayr ] ( https://www.doppelmayr.com/ ) is building cable cars all around the world . 
  not sure if they 're in any way better than others , but being a mountainous country we have a lot of expertise in that regard . 
  i speak [ viennese german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viennese_german ) which is a subdialect of [ ( east - ) central bavarian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/central_bavarian ) . 
  i did n't grow up in vienna , but i live there now and it 's very similar to what i spoke growing up about one hour from vienna . 
  in my home state burgenland , [ hianzisch ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hianzisch ) is also spoken . 
  i do n't speak it myself , but friends of mine a few villages further north speak like that . 
  let me help you out : the wikipedia entry on [ leberk\u00e4se ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leberk%c3%a4se ) has all the info . 
  k\u00e4seleberk\u00e4se is just a [ variant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leberk%c3%a4se#variants ) of it with bits of cheese ( = k\u00e4se ) . 
  ( btw also my favorite ) . 
  a [ semmel/kaiser roll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaiser_roll ) is the bun we like to put it in . 
  semmeln are very popular in austria and basically our go-to bread for sandwich-type snacks . 
  in austria , it 's super safe . 
  i have n't done it myself , but i have taken hitchhikers with me and it was always a fun experience . 
  nothing to worry about if you plan to hitchhike in central europe !, 
  well , the us does n't recognize the icc , so basically we 'd have to take bush , cheney , wolfowitz , etc. 
  hostage when they 're in europe and take them there . 
   i sense a diplomatic nightmare . 
  we do n't really have an elective system . 
  the curriculum and the classes you take are pretty much predetermined throughout middle and high school . 
  so the classes i had were german , math , english , french , latin , geography & economics , history , biology , chemistry , physics , art , pe , religion , philosophy and a few i probably forgot . 
  my only electives were advanced geography and cs . 
  we do n't have any ap classes , per se , but a small number of classes can get you `` college credit '' . 
  for example , if you had latin in hs , you do n't have to take the latin course that is mandatory for law and medicine in college . 
  despite not having electives , we have different types of high schools that you can choose when you 're 14 . 
  mine was the `` humanistic '' type , which focuses on languages and the humanities . 
  there are other types that focus on technology & engineering , business , or sports , and the curriculum in these is different , with the focus on whatever type of hs it is . 
  it may have been a thing in the past in small countries with `` shitty '' currencies , but in and around europe the euro has replaced the dollar as the currency under the pillow . 
  you can use euro for many transactions in the non-euro european countries - to varying degree , of course . 
  i do n't think anyone on the european continent is particularly interested in usd anymore . 
  it 's pretty common , for example , in south-east asia , in my experience . 
  if you ca n't find one , you could contact venice 's city hall/mayor 's office . 
  i 'd say write them an email , show proof you 're a flag collector and either they 'll tell you come by when you 're in venice and they give/sell you one , or they could at least give you the contact details of their supplier . 
  might help if the email you write them is both in english * and * italian . 
  it 's not a given that ever low-level secretary in city hall speaks english . 
  also , try / r/italy or / r/venice ( not sure how active the latter is ), 
  it was a terrible decision , and part of the us ' attempt to remove all leaders that `` caused trouble '' internationally ( = refuse to ally with us ) , i.e. 
  the whole `` axis of evil '' . 
  everybody knew that hussein was not an immanent threat to the us . 
  even if he 'd had wmds , why would he one day wake up and decide : `` hey , i 'll commit suicide today by attacking the us ! '' . 
  the us `` misunderestimated '' ( ( c ) bush ) the chaos after hussein , and destabilized the region for decades . 
  they unintentionally strengthened iran ( who now has great influence over shia iraq ) and created isis , the successor to al qaida in iraq ( aqi ) . 
  it was the worst military decision and execution since viet-nam , and europe now has to deal with the aftermath ( = refugees from iraq ) . 
  i 'm certainly not `` sympathetic '' with hussein , but tbh i 'd prefer him over isis . 
  i 'm usually very pro-american , but in this matter i can not find a single positive aspect of their actions . 
  the fact that very few people and decision makers in the us will take responsibility for this disaster and/or admit their mistakes is very disappointing to me . 
  edit : and i have n't even mentioned abu ghraib and guantanamo . 
  yet . 
  just brainstorming here : same antique maybe by an american company ? 
  ( e.g. 
  a clock , or a miniature statue ) or some art by an american artist ? 
  or the best bottle of whiskey they make across the pond ? 
  or try to think of something symbolic . 
  something that symbolizes where you live now and how far the family spread out ? 
  if you want to go with ( expensive ) jewelry , again choose an american maker . 
  something from `` tiffany 's '' , maybe ? 
  a nice photo of all her relatives in the us , in front of your house or near a landmark in wa ? 
  in the city ( vienna ) just a few moths . 
  today i had a butterfly , but that 's really rare . 
  i suppose spiders would also make their way in eventually . 
  in the countryside : fucking mosquitoes . 
  some years it 's bearable , some years it 's terrible . 
  depends on how warm and wet the spring is . 
  sometimes birds make it in our house but they eventually find their way out . 
  if you leave your door open a lot in fall , mice can come in looking for a warm winter spot , and sometimes the occasional toad . 
  fun-fact : a few years ago some bats apparently had a nest near my window , and whenever i left it open between 9pm and midnight , they 'd end up in my room . 
  they 're not dangerous , just a little creepy but they take forever to find their way out again ... 
   the country we would quite easily be in deep shit . 
  and so would the eu if the right wing takes over in too many countries . 
  i went through my coin jar : austria : 70 germany : 22 italy : 8 slovenia , slovakia , netherlands , greece : 4 spain : 3 france , belgium : 2 luxembourg , latvia : 1, 
  you could check out these movies : [ the edukators ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_edukators ) ( at/de , 2004 ) . 
  [ combat girls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combat_girls ) ( de , 2011 ) [ atomised ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atomised_ ( film \\ ) ) ( de , 2006 ) [ im juli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/im_juli ) ( de , 2000 ) [ this is england ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/this_is_england ) ( uk , 2006 ) [ human traffic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_traffic ) ( uk , 1999 ) [ dead in 3 days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dead_in_3_days ) ( at , 2006 ) genre : horror !, 
  yes , it 's called [ olm or proteus ( proteus anguinis ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olm ), 
  glad to hear you fit in !, 
   then i have two friends who were born here , one 's mother is chilene and one 's parents are turkish . 
  they speak german poorly and have poor general knowledge it 's often a matter of education and education of the parents . 
  the first turkish immigrants that came were given menial labor jobs , and some of them were even illiterate . 
  we also made the mistake of putting their children ( 2nd generation ) in `` special ed schools '' just because they did n't speak german when they entered grade school . 
  since then we 've improved a bit , e.g. 
  making one year of kindergarten mandatory , so immigrant kids at least speak the language once they enter school . 
  plus there are special german classes for those not raised in german language . 
   obviously it 's easier to integrate to a near-neighbouring country than to one on basically a different planet , hell , yes . 
  i could imagine living anywhere in europe or the anglosphere without much trouble integrating . 
  but if i had to go to japan , china or even saudi-arabia , it would take decades and would probably never really work , considering that i do n't even * want * to be there . 
  a trip to then yugoslavia , particularly [ rovinj ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rovinj ) ( croatia ) and the [ postojna cave ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/postojna_cave ) ( slovenia ) . 
  it must have been 1987 or 1988 .
