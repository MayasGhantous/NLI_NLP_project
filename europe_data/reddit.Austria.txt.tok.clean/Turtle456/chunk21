  i specifically remember the [ olms ] ( http://www.smashinglists.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/olm.jpg ) in the postojna cave . 
  i found it incredible that an animal would live its entire life in a cave and never see the light of day . 
  til !, 
  i knew that vienna around 1900 was ~ 1/3 czechs , but i did n't know it actually exceeded the czech population in prague . 
  fun fact : some 20 years ago an austrian delegation met with a czech delegation in prague . 
  the austrians were called vranitzky , lacina and klestil . 
  the czechs ' names were klaus , dienstbier and schwarzenberg . 
  touchy subject , but i 'll give it shot :  stories about failed/successful integration of expats we 're usually not talking about expats , but about immigrants . 
  if you 're just here to work for a multinational for a few years until you 're transferred to another country , you do n't need to integrate . 
  it 's also not about individuals ( = expats ) but rather about large groups ( = immigrants ) that may be even the majority in a neighborhood . 
   but never really found any clear and simple definition of the term `` integration '' in this context and i think it varies a lot between individuals/countries . 
  there is no clear definition . 
  it 's a political term and as such can have different connotations depending on place , time , and who says it . 
   so as a muslim , practicing my religion when it is legally allowed , working in a company and paying my taxes etc. . . and trying to learn the local language while also trying to preserve my traditions and apply them whenever possible , am i integrated or in the right path ? 
  learning the language is a plus !, 
  i 'd say having local friends is also part of it . 
  `` failed integration '' often means that immigrant groups keep to themselves and form parallel societies that locals can not access , be it private citizens , the authorities , or the school system . 
  if `` preserve your traditions '' means eating different food or listening to music from back home , it 's not a problem . 
  if it means keeping girls from getting an education , arranged marriages of teenagers , or not following the orders of a female cop , then there is a problem . 
  also , you can preserve your traditions , but at the same time add new ones of you host country . 
  when i lived in the us , i started watching nfl and nba , even though i did n't care for them before . 
  i did it , because it was a fun thing to to with the locals . 
  however , that did n't mean i had to stop following the european football leagues . 
   what does it me to fully integrate ? 
  i ask this question because i feel a lot of people wo n't accept an expat as integrated unless you totally strip off your culture and tradition and fully embrace their way of living which i find crazy . 
  depends on your definition of `` culture and tradition '' : when your colleagues go for a beer after work , do you join them and drink a coke instead or do you say `` never shall i enter such a place of sin ( = pub ) '' ? 
  do you treat ( western ) women/colleagues as equals or do you preach to people that women should n't dress `` provocatively '' ? 
  are you friends with any locals or do you just hang out with people from your country of origin ? 
  do you participate in any activities that people in your current country do ? 
  ( hiking , swimming , theater , opera , sports , etc. ), 
  i think it 's questions like these you can ask yourself to determine whether you 're well integrated . 
  but i want to stress again , individual expats usually are n't the issue , and if there is one dude running around in [ your city ] who does n't want to adapt to local customs , we really do n't care . 
  integration is usually only an issue with large groups of immigrants from a common place of origin . 
  * sorry if this is all over the place .

  ca n't think of one right now , but wanted to recommend / r/doesnottranslate .

  probably because most people here would just drink tap water . 
  basically , you * pay * for fizzy water . 
  still water is `` free '' at home anyway . 
   maybe just replace the food with strudel and schnitzel . 
  that 's exactly the changes i would make for vienna . 
  apparently we viennese have more in common with czechs than with our own `` mountain folk '' . 
  actually , schweinsteiger does n't sound dirty to me . 
  there are so many '' - steiger '' names in austria that it sounds really `` familiar '' and just does n't really stand out . 
  i found his nickname much worse , `` schweini '' , which basically means `` piggy '' . 
  [ this is a village ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/city_limit_sign_of_fucking%2c_austria.jpg ) in austria . 
  the sign has been stolen a number of times . 
   it 's so famous by now , it has [ wikipedia entries ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fucking,_austria ) in 50 languages . 
  ________________________________________ on * tons * of hungarian license plates it says `` fut '' , which is austrian slang for `` cunt '' . 
  * famous names : * johnny depp - `` depp '' is german for `` idiot '' . 
  former us bike racer kevin schwantz - `` schwanz '' is german for `` cock '' . 
  there 's a [ simpsons episode ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0769743/ ) called * `` burns verkaufen der kraftwerk '' * . 
  i love that title . 
  * tons * of loanwords in german , obviously most of them english . 
  `` smartphone '' , `` computer '' , `` last-minute '' ... you name it . 
  advertising loves to use english words , because they just sound cool and hip . 
  sometimes they 'll take an english word and add a german suffix to it to make it fit , for example * voten * ( to vote in talent shows ) or * shoppen * ( to shop ) . 
  it 's also very prevalent if you work in it , e.g. 
  `` booten '' , `` updaten '' or `` mounten '' . 
  if a native english speaker saw this , he 'd probably think it 's a parody of german by an english comedian . 
   we do pronounce them properly in english , but with a * thick * german accent . 
  i kind of like / r/austria , especially the help that 's provided for all kinds of questions . 
  there seem to be a few lawyers ( or law students ) there and they give very helpful info in legal matters . 
  i usually try not to miss anything in the sub , although i do n't post or comment much . 
  as austrians , we have another sub / r/de , a general purpose sub for at/de/ch . 
  it 's the de-facto country sub for germany , since / r/germany is in english and seems to be mostly expats . 
  / r/de has lots of content posts , but also a lot of bullshitting and the front page is usually 70 % posts flaired `` humor '' . 
  i like to stop by if i want to get a laugh :d . 
  it 's also nice to get in touch with germans in our own language . 
  fair enough . 
  i prefer the climate down under anyway . 
  officially and in formal conversations/correspondence we use the 24 hour clock . 
  digital clocks and e.g. 
  my operating system also show 24 hours format . 
  colloquially , we usually say 5 or 10 and from context you 'd infer morning or afternoon . 
  adding : op , if you 're interested , check out this recent thread from / r/austria : [ what 's the best austrian novel ?

  * i do n't dislike germany/germans by default . 
  there 's this whole rivalry going on , but i do n't buy into it . 
  * i do n't care much for the mountains/alps . 
  i like skiing for a week or two , but would n't want to live there . 
  * i really like meeting strangers/foreigners/visitors . 
  the average austrian needs some time to warm up to strangers , but i do n't . 
  you : `` hallo , wie geht 's dir ? '',
