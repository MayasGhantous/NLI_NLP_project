  '' * is also quite common . 
   there is no consensus as to the precise area it refers to , partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical , geographical , cultural , and socioeconomic connotations . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_europe ), 
   someone calls you from strange number and speaks as if he 's your friend . 
  [ . . ] he 's in some sort of trouble and like to ask you for a little favour , something a friend wo n't refuse . 
  very similar here , but it 's called the `` grandchild '' scam , since the scammers typically call old people and claim to be their grandson , great nephew or some more distant relative . 
  they then say they 'll send over a friend to pick up the money . 
  someone shows up , and some old people fall for it . 
  a while ago , one particular case of this made the news . 
  an old lady went to a bank in rural austria to withdraw a large amount . 
  the bank clerk , who knew her personally , called the lady 's family , who in turn called police and they actually captured the scammer when the money was supposed to change hands . 
  i did n't . 
  i grew up one hour from vienna and went to vienna for university . 
  i did get an apartment in vienna , although many people from my original area commute to vienna for work every day . 
  so yes , moving out to go to college is very common here , the distances just are n't that large . 
  for quite a while , i went home every weekend to go out , see friends , and to make my parents happy . 
  vienna is the largest city ( by a huge margin ) in austria , so people go to university here from all over austria . 
  some of my fellow students moved as far as 7 hours ( by train ) away from home , which is the maximum distance in austria . 
  there are other universities in smaller towns , but many people go to vienna because the range of study programs is much bigger here . 
  i might add , in austria it was not allowed to raise prices for quite some time ( maybe a year ? ), 
  which resulted in pretty weird prices , like 2,64 or 7,32 during that period . 
  i think prices had to be shown in ats and eur for another year at least . 
  here 's the [ wikipedia entry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/punschkrapfen ) ps : you can actually order an `` original sachertorte '' online . 
  they [ ship them wordlwide ] ( http://shop.sacher.com/original-sacher-torte.html ), 
  i would also add [ st. stephen 's cathedral ] ( http://www.simskultur.net/sites/default/files/imagecache/gallery/sites/default/files/spielstaette/stephansdom.jpg ) in vienna . 
  it 's definitely a national symbol , and it 's on the back of our [ 10 cents coin ] ( http://www.muenzen.eu/tl_files/bilder/oesterreich/10-cent-oesterreich.gif ) . 
  not a lawyer , but the degree of federalism in austria is definitely less than in the us . 
  i can only quote [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/states_of_austria#federalism_and_state_powers )  austrian federalism is largely theoretical as the states are granted few legislative powers . 
  the federal constitution initially granted all legislative powers to the states , but many powers have been subsequently taken away , and only a few remain , such as planning and zoning codes , nature protection , hunting , fishing , farming , youth protection , certain issues of public health and welfare and the right to levy certain taxes . 
   all other matters , including but not limited to criminal law , civil law , corporate law , most aspects of economic law , defense , most educational matters and academia , telecommunications , and much of the healthcare system are regulated by federal laws . 
  there is also no judiciary of the [ states ] , since the federal constitution defines the judiciary as an exclusively federal matter . 
  this centralisation follows a historic model where central power during the time of the empire was largely concentrated in vienna . 
  the states do not collect significant taxes , but federal taxes are distributed to them according to population and probably a few other factors . 
  the same goes for municipalities . 
  what 's more important in austria is the de-facto power some governors have in their political parties , through which they can influence decisions made by the federal govt . 
  the two largest states , vienna and surrounding lower austria , are strongly social-democratic and conservative , respectively . 
  since they represent a large chunk of the electorate of their parties , the governors are major figures in the national party organizations as well . 
  it 's often said that in austria nothing much can happen before these two governors have agreed . 
   as an average citizen , it does n't * feel * like the states matter much for everyday life , which seems to be in contrast to the us . 
  there is a strong cultural identity , though . 
  many austrians will feel as much a citizen of their state as they are austrian - somewhat similar to texans in the us . 
  in austria , we just round up to the next `` convenient '' number , keeping in mind that the tip should be * somewhat * proportional to the total . 
  examples : 2,20 -  2,50 ; 4,50 -  5 ; 8,80 -  10 ; 17,50 -  20 ; 37 -  40 ; 93 -  100 we do n't do a strict % calculation , but if you look at the numbers , it 's usually in the 10 % range . 
  the way you tell the waiter is when he says `` that would be 8,80 euro . 
  '' , you say `` make it 10 . '', 
  you would usually tip in all cafes , bars , restaurants and taxis . 
  some people tip hairdressers , but i 'm not sure how common it is . 
  generally , people in restaurants are paid a normal wage , though , and they do n't depend on the tips . 
  it 's nice if they get it and it can really add up if you work weekends in a busy bar , but you 're not a monster if you do n't tip . 
  so cool you would mention that !, 
  i remember this from a trip to copenhagen like 20 years ago . 
  it stood out to me because it 's named after vienna . 
  tried to google it a while back , but could n't find it - probably because i was missing the \u00f8 :d i just read up on the history of it . 
  afaik that story is totally unknown in austria . 
  also , funny that the anglosphere calls it danish , denmark calls it wiener , and in german it 's apparently called kopenhagener . 
  we have a similar thing with a type of sausage . 
  germany calls them `` wiener '' ( viennese ) and austria calls them frankfurter .

  [ mannerschnitten ] ( https://querschrift.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/man1010.jpg ) ( wafers ) . 
  manner is an old viennese company and something like a national treasure . 
  in the last ~ 20 years , they expanded their [ product line ] ( http://www.manner.com/de/home/produkte/2 ) [ schokobananen ] ( http://maps.casali.at/sites/default/files/casali_schoko-bananen_300g.jpg ) the casali company has other products that are very popular , like [ dragee keksi ] ( http://www.mozartkugelnoesterreich.de/images/drageekeksi.jpg ) and [ rumkugeln ] ( http://www.germandeli.com/product-images/casali-rum-kokos-300g-chocolate-w-rum-coconut-liquid-10-6oz_main-1.jpg ) [ schwedenbomben ] ( http://www.international-chocolates.com/i/schwedenbomben2.jpg ) ( swedish bombs ) . 
  they have a very thin chocolate cover and a very soft [ cream filling ] ( http://sprachkreis-deutsch.ch/wp-content/uploads/mohrenkopf.jpg ) as i googled for pics for this comment , i found a website called [ austrian supermarket ] ( https://www.austriansupermarket.com/manner-shop/manner-seit-1898-1 ) where you could order all this stuff , if you 're interested . 
  sounds about right . 
  our prices are even higher when `` bergrettung '' has to find you in the alps or when you need a medical helicopter when you 're skiing . 
  is there any specific/identifiable reason why alcohol laws are so different than in much of europe ? 
  i 'm not criticizing , just curious . 
  in the us , they usually say puritanism or a huge alcohol problem before prohibition . 
  the drinking age of 21 was a campaign by madd ( mothers against drunk driving ) in the 80s ( ? ) . 
  anything similar for the scandinavian countries ? 
  yeah , not a big deal , though . 
  not worse than calling texas `` the south '' . 
  i 'm not offended . 
  i know , but the wikipedia entry uses it . 
  no need to get all of europe involved in our language war with germany . 
  it 's very common . 
  the most popular ones that everyone is looking for are [ steinpilz ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/steinpilze ) , [ pfifferling/chanterelle ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/echter_pfifferling ) , and [ parasol ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gemeiner_riesenschirmling ) . 
  ( i linked the german pages for better pictures . ), 
  the state of carinthia ( borders slovenia , italy ) is most famous for mushrooms . 
  we 've actually had an `` international mushroom crisis '' with italy before . 
  when the borders opened , too many italians came to pick in austria ( for commercial purposes ) , so restrictions were put in place as to how much as single person is allowed to pick . 
  afaik , they sometimes even do random police checks and look in people 's trunks to enforce the law . 
   a random image search for the austrian word for mushroom picking ( `` schwammerlsuche '' ) brought up these . 
  lots of austrian families will have similar pictures in their albums .

  do you have any popular food with shrooms ? 
  we 'd usually fry them ( roll in flour -  roll in eggs -  roll in bread crumbs , then fry ) , or make them into a sauce and serve with [ kn\u00f6del / dumplings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kn%c3%b6del ) or rice . 
  mushroom sauce is also a side dish of many venison dishes , like wild boar or whatever comes from the forest . 
  chanterelles are a very nice addition to an omelette . 
  carnival is * huge * in germany . 
  here 's some pics of the parade in [ cologne ] ( http://www.express.de/image/302448/max/600/600/29beb6b70ffa7d6a386c080e98bdd785/kq/dom-karneval-koeln-imago-jpg.jpg ) . 
  here 's an [ american themed float ] ( http://www.india.diplo.de/contentblob/3446514/galeriebild_gross/2092735/karneval_5.jpg ) . 
  the focus is really on `` funny '' , not on `` scary '' the american counterpart would be mardi gras . 
  if you do an image search of `` carnival germany '' you 'll find lots . 
  regarding halloween : the same goes for austria as the parent comment said . 
  when i was a kid ( 1980s ) it was n't a thing at all here and we 'd only see it in us tv shows . 
  in the 90s shops started selling halloween themed candy . 
  this became more and more and now it 's * kind of * a thing here . 
  tv will show halloween episodes ( eg simpsons ) all week , bars and clubs will have halloween parties and people will get drunk . 
  i 'm not sure how much kids go trick or treating now , but i guess it may become common on the countryside .
