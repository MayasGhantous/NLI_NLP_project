  i 've never seen anyone decorating their house , though , and i do n't think it will be common for another 10/20 years - if ever . 
  the more i learn about slovenia in this sub , the more i see how many similarities we have . 
  we call them [ perchten ] ( http://www.perchten.net/files/assets/img_9782.jpg ) , with the focus on [ scary masks ] ( http://diepresse.com/images/uploads/b/0/8/1493768/0db4b9ea-879e-4c98-ac08-b2a351e3f13f_v0_h.jpg ) .

  what 's your favorite filling ? 
  here it 's apricot jam . 
  i grew up with dubbed tv/movies and i prefer it by far over subtitles . 
  the german dubbing is excellent and i 'd say  90 % of the original is preserved . 
  if something is originally in english , i 'll prefer the english version , especially if i 'm used to a certain show or an actor in english . 
  some shows like * the simpsons * or long running sitcoms i sometimes watch in german , sometimes in english - whatever is on . 
  i have watched some german movies with english subtitles before and i felt that a lot was lost in the subs , which is n't the case in dubbing ( or a least to a much lesser extent ) . 
  ymmv , but i 'm all for dubbing , if done well . 
   people from germany can sometimes understand some dutch and vice versa , if spoken clearly and slowly ime i ca n't understand dutch when spoken normally , but i 've never done experiments with a dutch speaker what it 's like when spoken slowly . 
  i can understand * some * written dutch , but not to the extent that i would enjoy reading a book or a newspaper . 
  traffic signs or newspaper headlines can work , but i can never be sure if i did n't completely miss the point because of words that just look very similar but mean something completely different . 
  i can definitely read luxembourgish , but have n't had much chance to hear it spoken . 
  this may interest you : as an austrian , knowing austrian/bavarian dialect , i can understand 99 % of swiss-german , especially on tv . 
  sometimes there is a person/commentator who i have trouble following , and i 'm assuming they 're from a specific linguistic area of ch . 
  there is a great italian film called [ gommorah ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0929425/ ) ( 2008 ) which i absolutely recommend . 
  it 's based on the book [ gommorah ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gomorrah_ ( book \\ ) ) . 
   gomorrah is a non-fiction investigative book by roberto saviano published in 2006 documenting saviano 's infiltration and investigation of various areas of business and daily life controlled or affected by the italian criminal organization known as camorra . 
  there 's also a tv-series now .

  they are used a lot in germany , austria and the netherlands ( and others ) , but on average they are smaller than american rvs . 
  european roads are narrower and fuel is more expensive . 
  people either have [ caravans ] ( http://www.caravantimes.co.uk/photo/dethleffs-caravans-$7073776$326.jpg ) that you tow with your everyday car , or [ rvs like this ] ( http://www.fast-alles.net/pictures/422189.jpg ) . 
  the compartment above the driver 's seat has room for two people to sleep in ( or parents with a small child ) .

  i had to research this myself , since it 's a little complicated . 
  after the end of the austrian-hungarian empire , the ( first ) republic of austria existed for 20 years , and was then annexed by nazi-germany . 
  after wwii there was a declaration of independence ( 1945 ) and a provisional government was put in place . 
  the * soviet union * was the first country to recognize the new government , soon followed by the us , uk and france . 
  however , austria was occupied by these 4 countries for another 10 years . 
  we regained full sovereignty in 1955 when the [ state treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_state_treaty ) was signed by the * us , uk , france and soviet union * . 
  austria itself considers its year of birth to be 996 ad . 
  from [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/margraviate_of_austria#name )  the old high german name ** ostarr\u00eechi ** first appeared on a famous deed of donation issued by emperor otto iii at bruchsal in november 996 . 
  [ ... ] the term ostarr\u00eechi is linguistic ancestor of the german name for austria , ** \u00d6sterreich ** . 
  in this case , the holy roman empire would probably be the answers to op 's question . 
  ** article 1 ** austria is a democratic republic . 
  its law emanates from the people .

  i 've visited south africa and i can tell you that the white people there definitely feel * south african * . 
  i do n't think they feel part of a greater `` african '' identity with people from nigeria and egypt , but they are certainly attached to the country of south africa . 
  they do n't feel foreign to the area , from what i could tell . 
  i recently saw a tv report about ethnic germans in namibia ( former german colony ) and they said the same - they feel namibian . 
  the few israelis i know feel very much israeli , despite their grandparents having grown up in pre wwii germany/poland . 
   who does n't biologically belong to a certain territory depends on how far you go back . 
  whites technically do n't belong in the americas , but they 've been there for centuries now and are even the majority in some places ( us , ca ) . 
  i do n't think white americans feel `` out of place '' in the us , and neither do australians in au . 
  i 'm sure the black people in the caribbean ( cuba , jamaica ) feel part of their country . 
   how much a person [ ... ] is born in that country , feels really part of it . 
  i think the bigger issue ( wherever you are ) is being a minority and how well you 're treated in your country . 
  if you 're constantly reminded by the majority that you 're not `` one of us '' , you wo n't get a sense of belonging . 
  if you 're well integrated , it 's fine . 
  only a few decades ago , we ( european countries ) treated our own european minorities like crap . 
  austrians in italy , slovenes in austria . . the list goes on . 
  but if the majority allows the minority people to become part of a country/nation , they certainly will - usually between the 2nd and 4th generation . 
   do black people born in europe feel europeans ? 
  ethnically , no . 
  culturally , sure . 
  maybe not 1st or 2nd generation , but eventually . 
  i 've heard a few black football players say they feel german , because they 've never lived anywhere else and german is their first language . 
  not really no . 
  it 's been a while since i 've traveled in europe , but the eurrail ticket is pretty much valid for all trains , except high speed . 
  some trains you can use , but have to pay ~ 10 $ extra fee for that type of train and/or may require seat reservation ( ~ 5 $ ? ) . 
  try / r/travel . 
  there 's lots of people who 've done it recently or are doing it right now . 
   actually , you could cross before the fall of communism too , it was possible but far from common ( not sure what was needed ) . 
  one of the most vivid memories i have from going to hu as a child , was a hungarian arguing with and begging the border guards . 
  i was < 10 yo , so i asked my parents and they explained he apparently thought he could cross , but something was wrong with his permits . 
  it really stuck with me for a long time that we could just travel freely but hungarians could n't . 
  i think in east germany , only parts of a family were allowed to go to the west at a time , to ensure that people would return . 
  i can give you the history of the austrian-hungarian border : before 1989 when the iron curtain was up it was heavily fortified . 
  guards had machine guns , there were watchtowers and even mines along the `` green border '' . 
  as western europeans we could go to hungary without much hassle , but rarely did . 
  after the fall of communism , people could cross both ways , but they would stamp your passport each time , look in your trunk and further inspect cars that were suspicious . 
  i imagine it to be somewhat similar to the us-mexico border . 
  over the years , it became more relaxed and they would only have a glance at your passport . 
  even later , it was enough to hold up your passport through the window and they 'd wave you through . 
  random checks could still happen though , because many austrians would go over and buy cheap cigarettes and not declare them . 
  during all these years , crossing the border could take anything from one minute to 2 hours . 
  rush hours were weekdays in the morning and evening ( hungarians going to work in austria ) and weekends at daytime ( austrians going on day trips to eat , shop , etc. ) . 
  when schengen came into effect , the border facilities were removed and now it 's just a road . 
  if it were n't for the traffic signs looking a little different on both sides , you would n't necessarily notice you just crossed a border . 
  you still need to have id on you , as random police checks can still happen occasionally . 
   has schengen altered your life in any way ? 
  i used to go to hungary every weekend to go out in my early 20s . 
  crossing was usually quick , as we always went outside of rush hours , but sure , no border is still better than the risk of a random search . 
   for many hungarian commuters i 'm sure it 's a great improvement . 
  the group that most profited are truck drivers , though . 
  they sometimes had  12 hours waiting time , as they were checked much more thoroughly . 
  imo , you do n't need to say anything nice about my country . 
  just accept that we have our own traditions and values that may be a little different from the us . 
  i 'm open to all kinds of debate as long as they 're civil and based on facts , not on internet rumors or stereotypes . 
  genuine interest and questions are always welcome . 
  here 's a recent thread full of nice things people had to say about the us : [ those of you who visited the usa , what did you think ? 
  what were your expectations ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5006bx/those_of_you_who_visited_the_usa_what_did_you/ )  i ca n't seem to say anything in / r/europe that does n't end in downvotes honestly , i do n't get/like the whole europe vs. 
  us war here on reddit and i think it 's a shame that civil debate rarely happens .
