  what i * can * tell you is that we quite often get trolled by americans in this sub , which * may * result in people being suspicious of american posters in general . 
  i assume it happens in / r/europe as well , but i 'm not a regular there . 
  i 'm sure it also happens the other way . 
  however , i 've also seen in this sub that people will give you nice responses if questions are genuine and not loaded , so feel free to come here anytime . 
  the official language is [ austrian german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_german ) . 
  i 'd say the differences to german in germany is roughly like british and american english . 
  the recognized minority languages in austria are croatian , hungarian and romany ( east ) , slovene ( south ) , and czech , slovak and hungarian ( vienna ) . 
  hungarian , slovene , and romany are pretty obvious , because they are in border areas . 
  the croatian minority dates back hundreds of years and settled there after one of the ottoman sieges of vienna . 
  czech , slovak and hungarian in vienna are remnants of the austro-hungarian empire ( rip ) . 
  all these minorities in austria can be seen as assimilated , though , as they are all bilingual . 
  there are no exclusively non-german schools in austria , and the minority language is only taught as a second language in the respective areas . 
  i 'm actually an example of the minorities disappearing . 
  in my village , older people would still speak croatian to each other , as did my grandma . 
  many did n't teach their children , so my dad can understand some , but does n't speak it . 
  i only know a few words that i learned in elementary/middle school , but definitely not enough to call myself part of that minority any more . 
  i know people my age who speak only croatian at home and did n't learn german until kindergarten , but that 's becoming pretty rare these days . 
  edit : i stand corrected . 
  apparently , a slovene-only school exists in carinthia . 
  is it true that it 's illegal to speak english as a tourist in france ? 
  do french people get guillotined if they speak english to foreigners ? 
   edit : corrected guillotine . 
  papers that were submitted to conferences or journals had to be in ae , yes . 
  we did n't have any british students in our group , but one pakistani and one indian guy ( i 'm assuming they use be back home ) , and yes , they too had to submit papers in ae . 
  just an assignment to your prof : it probably did n't matter much , since spelling was n't the prime concern in cs assingments . 
   are they practiced in schools like they are in the usa ? 
  in austria no , not at all . 
  in school you only have a few hours of pe per week , but that 's it . 
  there are no school sports teams or leagues . 
  if you do any sport competitively , you do it with a club in your community , and it 's completely independent of the school system . 
  the most common sport is obviously football/soccer and playing for your club goes way beyond high school/college age , and well into your 30s . 
   how popular are grappling sports ( judo , jiu-jitsu , wrestling , etc ) not very popular , i 'd say . 
  wrestling is virtually non-existent . 
  various types of martial arts have been gaining in popularity , but they are far from being `` popular '' sports . 
  i 've only ever met one person who did karate on a competitive level . 
  in middle and high school , it was strictly british english . 
  pronunciation should also have been british , but our teachers were all austrian , and except for one , they all had a * strong * austrian/german accent . 
  in university , the standard became american english . 
  the standard spelling in all academic papers ( cs ) is american english , so that 's what we had to use , too . 
  ca n't say that the situation for young people is a particular problem in austria . 
  we have a bit of an unemployment problem , but the most affected group are people 50 + . 
  if they lose their job , it 's very hard to find a new one , because companies will rather hire young people , as it 's cheaper for them . 
  if you 're referring to debt from college loans : those are not a problem , because college is free here . 
  generally , i think it 's more common here for parents/families to support their children when they 're `` staring their own life '' . 
  i think it 's safe to say that hitler is today viewed as terrible for europe and responsible for wwii . 
  if you talk to old people , or those who were kids between 1938 and 1945 , there are still some who 'll say `` it was n't * all * bad , and the really bad things we did n't know . '', 
  but that 's an opinion that people will usually only utter in private or among people they know . 
  even the right-wing party would n't go as far a calling hitler in any way a positive figure . 
  officially , austria sees the years of nazi-rule as the `` one of the darkest hours in its history '' . 
  i think it 's phrases like this or similar that politicians will use in speeches on memorial days . 
  from the little i know about ultra-right wing people , only a fraction of those are actually hitlerites these days . 
  there are new ideas/ideologies among the extreme right and they go as far as being connected between european countries , and they also accept the slavs , which hitler did n't . 
  ** tl , dr : ** no nostalgia for hitler here , except few individuals . 
  some will play down the terrible things he did , but i do n't think anybody would want to return to a comparable system of government/dictatorship . 
  also , austria 's national identity is much stronger now , so i doubt many people would support another anschluss/annexation by germany . 
  i 've been a few of times , and also lived there for a year . 
  i enjoyed ( almost ) every minute of it . 
  the west coast is amazing to travel , especially that stretch from las vegas to la. 
  it 's the ultimate road-tripping region . 
  the cities on the west coast were a little disappointing , as i was missing a city center the way we have them in europe . 
  the walk of fame was disappointing , but i 've heard that from countless travelers . 
  i did love disneyland and universal studios , though . 
  ( this was a family trip when i was 15 ) . 
  i visited nyc and dc at 18/19 and 25 , and it was beyond great . 
  i stayed with a friend in nyc so i had a local guide which is the best way to travel anywhere . 
  dc was like a theme park for the politics and history nerd/buff that i am . 
  i spent 3 full days just walking around the city and it seemed like every building was significant in one way or the other . 
  the air and space museum was awesome . 
  i loved it all the way . 
  if i had to find something that i found disappointing it would be the abundance and ubiquity of chain-operated restaurants , be it fast food or starbucks . 
  in europe we 're used to more individually owned and privately run cafes/restaurants , and the chains in the us make some places a little `` soulless '' . 
  but yeah , that 's just something i noticed and not a big deal . 
  i was actually happy every time i found an arby 's . 
  ( like it and we do n't have it here . ), 
  so , yeah . 
  a + for the us as a travel destination , assuming sufficient funds and time , or someone you can stay with . 
  i 'd say `` medium popular '' . 
  there are enough opportunities to play pool in any large , medium and even small town . 
  some places will have one or two tables , but there are also pool halls . 
  it 's quite common to go `` play some pool '' with a group of guys and have a few beers while playing . 
  the most popular game among casual players is 8-ball . 
  finding a snooker table would be difficult in small towns . 
  [ karambol/carom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carom_billiards ) tables might even be more common . 
  as a competitive sport i think it 's less popular than , say , in the uk . 
  i sometimes watch pool/snooker on eurosport , and i ca n't imagine the same enthusiasm for it here as i see in those tournaments ( which are mostly in the uk , i think . ), 
  that said , as with anything , i 'm sure there is a scene for it here , and probably also clubs and regional competitions , at least in large cities like vienna . 
  the only professional austrian player i know of is [ jasmin ouschan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jasmin_ouschan ), 
  all in all , i think the police are viewed favorably here . 
  probably everyone has had one ore two `` bad '' experiences with a cop being unfriendly , commanding , or a little `` drunk with power '' , but most encounters you have are positive or at least professional . 
  especially when you 're a young guy , they can be a little patronizing or dickish during traffic stops , but that gets better once you approach your 30s . 
  in the countryside , many people will know a story about the one cop you should n't mess with . 
  the one issue there seems to be is that you have virtually no chance of winning a lawsuit against police . 
  there have been a few cases in the past where the sentencing against bad cops was extremely lenient or they were acquitted . 
  as a consequence , the general opinion here ( as far as i can tell ) is '' * if * police abuse their power or break the law , they get away with it . '',

  op , if you want more suggestions for german films , check out [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/de/comments/4rvuj3/beste_deutsche_filme/ ) from / r/de . 
  the thread 's in german , but it should be easy enough to extract the movie titles . 
  aaah , bill burr - my absolute favorite comedian at the moment . 
  and that is a great bit , too . 
  time to re-watch his specials .
