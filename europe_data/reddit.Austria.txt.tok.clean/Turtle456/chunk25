  at the moment , we 're really proud of director [ michael haneke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/michael_haneke ) and he 's winning awards all over the place . 
  you should check out some of his movies . 
  they 're often international productions , so i ca n't really call the movies austrian . 
  i hope you 're also familiar with the work of [ arnold schwarzenegger ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000216 ) , one of austria 's greatest sons . 
  unfortunately , his exceptional performances were often ignored at the academy awards , particularly * twins * and * kindergarten cop * . 
  we believe this is an international conspiracy to keep austria down , but we ca n't prove it yet . 
  ** the counterfeiters ( 2007 ) ** * ( oscar for best foreign language film !, 
  ) *  the counterfeiters ( german : die f\u00e4lscher ) is a 2007 austrian-german drama film written and directed by stefan ruzowitzky . 
  it fictionalizes operation bernhard , a secret plan by nazi germany during the second world war to destabilize the united kingdom by flooding its economy with forged bank of england pound notes . 
  the film centres on a jewish counterfeiter , salomon ` sally ' sorowitsch , who is coerced into assisting the operation at the sachsenhausen concentration camp . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_counterfeiters_ ( 2007_film \\ ) ) ** contact high ( 2009 ) ** an episodic comedy that follows the lives of four men living in vienna . 
  kind of a road movie , including xtc and mushrooms . 
   [ imdb ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780002/ ) ** dead in 3 days ( 2006 ) ** pretty good horror movie . 
  there 's also a sequel . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dead_in_3_days ), 
  sure . 
  from what i see in us tv-shows , it 's similar enough , the biggest difference being the metal casket and embalming , which i have n't even heard of here . 
  i should also say that cremations and funerals without a priest are becoming more common , as people are becoming less religious . 
  the urns/ashes would then be buried in a grave or sealed in a [ wall ] ( http://www.friedhof-ansichten.de/wp-content/gallery/voels/voels_05.jpg ) at the cemetery . 
  afaik it 's not allowed to keep the ashes at home . 
  the bigger difference between us and at ime is what cemeteries look like . 
  here 's a few typical ones in austria . 
  [ 1 ] ( http://cdn1.salzburg24.at/2012/10/friedhof_bb.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/st_wolfgang-friedhof-christlich.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://p1.pkcdn.com/friedhof-wien-osterreich_365650.jpg ) people usually put a lot of effort into keeping the grave in shape , which may include planting new flowers a few times a year ( or paying someone to , if you do n't live nearby ) . 
  here 's how i have experienced it : when a person has passed , you contact a `` funeral company '' and they pick up the body . 
  you can give them a set of nice clothes if you want the deceased to wear them . 
  then you call the priest and arrange a date , usually 3-7 days after the death . 
  the funeral company also prints the '' [ notifications ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/musterparte.png ) '' which you send to everyone who you want to notify . 
  notifications may also be put up by the cemetery or in local businesses in rural areas and small towns . 
  a day before the funeral , the casket + body is brought to the cemetery and kept in the building where the funeral will be held . 
  open caskets are extremely rare in austria and so is embalming . 
  caskets are made of wood , not metal . 
  some caskets have a little glass opening on the top to look inside , but this is optional . 
  in very traditional ( catholic ) settings , relatives or close friends might spend the remaining ~ 24 hours by the casket , praying . 
  i think this tradition is called `` guarding the dead '' , but i only remember this from when i was a kid and it 's becoming increasingly rare . 
  the funeral itself usually starts at 2 pm and anyone who wants can come . 
  the closest relatives are seated by the casket and all funeral guests go up to the casket , make an honoring gesture ( cross , holy water , nod , etc ) and offer their sympathies to the relatives . 
  then the priest performs the `` funeral mass '' ( ~ 20mins ) . 
  then the casket is carried to the grave in a small procession led by family , then close friends , then `` others '' . 
  the casket is lowered into the grave and a friend/relative may give a speech ( optional ) . 
  then all guests walk up to the grave individually for a `` last good-bye '' , and it 's customary to throw flowers and a small amount of earth into the grave and onto the casket ( a bucket and a little shovel is provided ) . 
  that 's usually the end of the funeral for more distant guests . 
  * ( depending on how religious the family is , there may now be another mass in the local church , but this is optional . 
  ) * usually the family and only very close friends will now go eat at a local restaurant and this is usually when the sad mood of the funeral changes into a lighter one.people usually talk about the deceased , share stories , and there may even be some joking , depending on how well the family/widow/children have processed the events and how ( un ) expected the death was . 
   for me it 's the blue danube waltz < 3 < 3, 
  in austria , to my knowledge , no . 
  it would just be `` my child 's godparent '' . 
   our word for nepotism stems from it . 
  in germany , the word for nepotism is * vettern * wirtschaft , and * vetter * means * cousin * . 
  in austria , it 's * freunderl * wirtschaft , and * freund * means * friend * . 
  yes , i consider myself informed now !, 
   thanks for taking the time and for the detailed answers !, 
  i have a follow up : do you watch french films/tv with subtitles or is there dubbing ? 
  i read a long time ago that virtually nothing is dubbed into english , but more recently heard they are doing some now . 
  so what 's the situation with french films ? 
  thank you !, 
  that was more than expected . 
  i was aware of the `` special situation '' between state and religion in france , although not in as much detail . 
  i still have a few follow ups : * was the ban planned long ahead ? 
  why had n't burkinis been banned years ago , since the reasoning seems to have been around for quite a while ? 
  * who are the advocates of the recent ban ? 
  local mayors ? 
  the national govt ? 
  `` the public '' ? 
  * is there a ( more or less ) consensus in france for it or are certain groups against it ? 
  * are there any other laws planned prohibiting religious symbols/garment ? 
  * important : i am not trying to criticize france !!, 
  i actually support burqa and niqab bans . 
  it 's your thing and you do what you do !, 
  i 'm just trying to understand the arguments for it . 
  * i take from your tl , dr that it is about unity , maybe `` equality '' . 
  but would n't that consequently imply further bans ? 
  what about sikh turbans ? 
  christian nuns ? 
  forgive me if i am missing your point . 
   damn , we 're a weird country . 
  nah , just different traditions . 
  and yes , we do n't really have campuses , either . 
  most universities are in ( the middle of ) bigger cities and people just live in shared apartments all over the city and go to clubs/bars/cafes like you said . 
  there are student dorms , too , all over the city , but independent of the college and people from different universities are mixed there . 
  there 's some serious partying going on in these as well , mostly because it means 1 $ for a beer instead of 4 $ in bars . 
   plethora of german beers , probably berlin * munich/bavaria * is beer central . 
  you know , oktoberfest , hofbr\u00e4uhaus , beer gardens , 1-liter-glasses - that 's munich !, 
  obviously , germany has tons of breweries and types of beer outside bavaria , but you can probably get those even in munich , at least in supermarkets . 
  the selection of beers will be large enough for 4 days in any city , but munich definitely has more of the `` beer culture '' . 
  i just want to add that we do n't have these fierce debates in colleges in europe ( that i know of ) . 
  university is mostly a place for studying , and all social debates happen elsewhere , either in the political parties , tv debate shows , or maybe some ngo/activist groups . 
  i guess more and more is happening on social media these days but it 's super easy to avoid that by just not going to these websites . 
  i kinda knew us colleges were politicized , but did n't know to what degree until relatively recently . 
  anyway , just wanted to say that public debate is a little different here and ( so far ) the various groups seem a little less extreme/divided than in the us . 
   as it stands i am leaning more towards munich as that is what i think of when i think of germany !, 
  because of this , i think you should go to munich . 
  if someone thinks of the us as desert roads and hollywood , they should go to the west coast . 
  if they think of it as new york and dc , they should go to the east coast . 
  anything else can be disappointing for a first time visitor . 
  personally , i 'm a bigger fan of berlin , because i * love * the recent history , wwii and cold war stuff , but if you have a certain image of germany and want to see that , then munich it is . 
  definitely do n't do both cities in 4 days , that would n't do either city justice . 
  but if you have 4 full days in munich , you could use one day for a day trip to something nearby - either the countryside or a smaller town . 
  if you 're there in * late * november , you get the extra bonus of christmas markets/decorations in munich . 
  other than that , i can only advise to do some research on the specifics in the cities and if you have any particular interests , eg . 
  what sights there are and which museums you might visit .
