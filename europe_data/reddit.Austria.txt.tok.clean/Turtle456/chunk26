  if you just want to stroll around , soak up the atmosphere and feel a bit of germany/bavaria the way you imagine it , i 'd say go to munich . 
  this was just posted in our country sub : [ hiking in the austrian alps ] ( https://imgur.com/a/re4fs ), 
  if you like this kind of stuff , you should subscribe to / r/travel . 
  people always post photos or albums from their trips all around the world . 
  a good portion of them are nature-related . 
  you can ignore the text-posts which are just questions about traveling but if you stay on the front page , it 's usually the photos that are upvoted the most . 
  yes , and idiot me accidentally deleted the parent comment . 
  here it is again : _______________________________________________________ besides the [ austrian national parks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_parks_of_austria#national_parks ) we have 2 notable unesco world heritage sites of type `` cultural landscape '' . 
  it refers to areas that have been shaped ( by people ) for centuries or even millenia , and have become worthy of preserving in their own right . 
  they 're not national parks , but sort of a symbiosis of nature and human culture . 
  one is [ salzkammergut ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salzkammergut ) , with the town of [ hallstadt ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/hallstatt_300.jpg/450px-hallstatt_300.jpg ) in it . 
  the second one is the [ wachau ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wachau ) valley [ along the danube river ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/danube_in_the_wachau_valley.jpg/1200px-danube_in_the_wachau_valley.jpg ) _______________________________________  austria looks lovely from everything you 've shown me . 
  thank you ! . 
  our national parks might not be as huge/extensive , but there 's lot 's of hiking opportunities in areas with little population/infrastructure . 
  maybe a hut here , or a little farm there , but still a pretty good nature experience . 
  i had to google that myself , and i just learned * anna fenninger * is now called * anna veith * ( got married in april ) . 
  regarding her health : according to a statement on her website , she hopes to be back for the first race in s\u00f6lden , but is n't sure yet . 
  i 'm actually a fan of tina maze . 
  i totally fell in love with her pretty face when she started skiing internationally ( she 's roughly my age ) . 
  do n't know anything else about her , other than that she 's cute . 
   i think most austrians actually like lindsey vonn , too . 
  she was married to an austrian ( hence her last name ) , lives/lived in austria and speaks fluent german , with a noticeable austrian ring to it . 
  i vaguely remember some controversy about her , but i do n't follow the drama in ( any ) sports , i just watch the games/races . 
  last year she broke the age-old record for most victories in women 's skiing , which was previously held by an austrian , so that kinda sucks , but what can you do ... , 
  not a comic , but a long running german science-fiction novel series is [ perry rhodan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/54/perry_rhodan_issue1.jpg/330px-perry_rhodan_issue1.jpg ) . 
  i guess it 's somewhat similar to star trek . 
  from [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perry_rhodan ) :  perry rhodan is the eponymous hero of a german science fiction novel series which has been published each week since 8 september 1961 in the ` romanhefte ' format ( digest-sized booklets , the german equivalent of the now-defunct american pulp magazine ) the most popular european comic book series is probably [ asterix ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/asterix1.png ) , but i 'll let someone from france explain that . 
  and you could make me a senator . 
  judging by your username , i guess you 're talking about ancient rome ? 
  that 's better !, 
   makes me wonder how familiar other nations are with american sports . 
  make another post . 
  i 'd be interested as well . 
  nfl has been gaining in popularity here recently , with 2 games per week shown live in germany . 
  ( 1 in austria ) . 
  it 's still a niche sport , but ten years ago only the super bowl would have aired live , and 20 years ago not even that . 
  not very common in austria . 
  the most popular `` financial product '' is savings accounts . 
  many people are very suspicious of stocks , banks or financial markets in general and many rely on the ( so far ) pretty good state pension systems . 
  austrians tend to be pretty risk-avers , or at least that 's how we see ourselves . 
  other types of investments are sloooowly becoming more popular ( or even known ) . 
  if anything , people will invest small amounts of money in low-risk funds . 
  they have been arguing for more economics in schools , but so far to no effect , afaik . 
   talk about investing ? 
  again , no , because many people here consider financial stuff a private matter . 
  it 's very uncommon to know other people 's income or how much they have saved up . 
  people are very secretive about it . 
   i used to think it was south-german specific . 
  how dare you , sir !, 
  * servus * is as austrian as mozart and skiing . 
   it 's usually pronounced more like * serwas * over here , though . 
  i love how he 's still polite enough to say '' * please * piss off '' . 
  ** football ** is probably the most popular sport in austria in terms of how many people actively play it . 
  austrian teams usually do n't qualify , but champions league still gets high tv ratings . 
  we 're usually not that successful internationally , but individual players sometimes make it and they 're all household names . 
  our current star is [ david alaba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/david_alaba ) who won the champions league with bayern munich . 
  ** formula 1 ** is pretty popular , gets decent tv ratings , and since last year there is also an austrian gp ( spielberg ) in the f1 calendar . 
  attendance in the first year was huge , this year not so much , due to weather and high prices . 
  in the years we did n't have a race in austria , many austrians would go to the hungarian gp . 
  three time world champion [ niki lauda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niki_lauda ) is super famous . 
  at the moment , we do n't have a driver , but support the austrian red bull team . 
  * aaaaand * then there are winter sports , particularly ** alpine skiing ** and ** ski jumping ** . 
  these are the sports we are super passionate about and where we actually win quite a bit . 
  they get the highest ratings , and the downhill race at the 1976 olympics in innsbruck , austria is still the broadcast with the highest ratings in austrian television history . 
  former olympic medalists or world champions are basically royalty in austria . 
  we talk about [ franz klammer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_klammer ) , [ hermann maier ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_maier ) and [ g. schlierenzauer ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gregor_schlierenzauer ) the way americans talk about babe ruth , joe montana or michael jordan . 
  our current super-hero is [ marcel hirscher ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marcel_hirscher ) , and he 's in seemingly every other tv commercial and interview . 
  * ( for reference : outstanding american alpine skiers are bode miller and lindsey vonn who you may have heard about . 
  i do n't know any american ski jumpers . 
  i think you ca n't go wrong with some american candy . 
  hershey bars , butterfinger and life savers are not available in austria at least . 
  many things are sold over here , but in a smaller variety than in the us . 
  for example , you could bring different types of oreos ( we only have the `` standard '' ones ) . 
  here 's a thread from / r/austria from a while ago , where an american asked what he should include in a care package he wants to send to austria . 
  many of the suggestions would probably work for germany and switzerland , too , although i ca n't be sure . 
  [ sending a care package to a friend in austria . 
  any ideas on what to send ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/austria/comments/4hi35s/sending_a_care_package_to_a_friend_in_austria_any/ ), 
   there 's this alleged hate of non-european borns in europe i wish i could say `` there is none of that '' , but if you look european , speak ( apparently ) perfect english and spanish , and have european citizenship , you should be less affected by xenophobia in europe than other groups . 
  especially if you plan to work in r&d / science/academia , you will be working in a completely international field . 
  it 'll be a mix of people from european and non-european countries and nobody cares about the other person 's nationality . 
  however , do n't think europe is a utopia . 
  there still exists xenophobia , even between europeans . 
  just think of the recent anti-polish sentiments in the uk ( brexit ) and it definitely exists in other countries , too . 
  you wo n't experience any open hate or even violence , but being accepted as `` one of [ insert country ] '' can be tough and may be a life-long task . 
  you probably have similar things in the americas - i 'm sure there are stereotypes/animosities between seemingly similar people ( s ) of central/south america , and even a peruvian might face some issues in venezuela and vice versa . 
  i 've known all kinds of cases . 
  a friend of mine ( us , `` brown '' skinned ) lived in vienna for 3 years , never learned german , and within 1 month knew more people in the city than me and everybody loved him . 
  i 've heard of other people with a `` southern/mediterranean '' mentality , who never get used to the `` cold/reserved '' mentality further north and could n't find happiness even after 10 years . 
  so yeah , europe is nice but it has its quirks for immigrants or intra-european migrants . 
  it may depend on you , or even on luck in some cases . 
  that said , if it 's really that easy for you to get spanish citizenship * and * keep your own , by all means do it . 
  a year or two abroad is a great experience either way , and if it means getting a passport that lets you travel anywhere in the world and live anywhere in the eu , i would n't hesitate one second . 
  avid watcher of swiss tv here . 
  many of the programs are in standard german , but quite a few also in swiss german . 
  when i was a kid ( ~ 10 years ) i had serious problems understanding swiss german , although i obviously spoke and understood standard german and east-austrian dialect ( similar to bavarian ) . 
  today , i understand 98 % of what they 're saying on swiss tv and can follow it without a problem . 
  however , every now and then they 'll have someone on who i barely understand ( e.g. 
  recently sports commentators during the olympics ) . 
  i figure , these must be people from specific regions with `` stronger '' dialects .
