  [ swiss german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_german ) is n't really one specific dialect , but more an umbrella term for all dialects spoken in switzerland . 
  some of them seem to be harder to understand for non-swiss native german speakers . 
  much of this goes for me as well , although i do often speak the dialect . 
  i grew up in the countryside ( [ burgenland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgenland ) ) , and everyone there speaks dialect most of the time . 
  to clarify for op : east-austrian dialect can be understood by all austrians as well as bavarians . 
  it 's different enough from standard german for many northern germans not to understand it , unless they 've been exposed to it for a while . 
  there are many other distinguishable dialects in austria , but we can all understand each other , except for a few regional words . 
  the one austrian state that 's different ( linguistically ) , is [ vorarlberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vorarlberg ) , where they speak very similar to [ swiss german ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_german ) . 
  very similar in austria , except pretzel . 
  the most popular sandwich in austria is [ wurstsemmel ] ( https://babsienko.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/wurstsemmel.jpg ) , often [ with pickles ] ( http://www.frischamtisch.com/uploads/tx_itcprodukte/semmel-mit-wiener.png ) . 
  everything i said is accurate for many burschenschaften in austria and according to some other posters also in germany . 
  i have talked to a few , but usually avoid them because they 're ( usually ) right wing nativist idiots . 
  they are also the people who mourn the defeat in wwii on may 8 at heldenplatz , vienna . 
  ( euphemistically called `` totengedenken '' ( mourning the dead ) , the first image in my parent comment ) . 
  some of them are/were even watched by the austrian `` verfassungsschutz '' ( domestic intelligence service ) . 
  if you share their views and want to defend them , you 're at liberty to do so , but everything i said is accurate . 
  that 's all i 'm gon na say in this regard . 
  yes . 
  not all , but some ( depends on the fraternity ) . 
  here 's some info on [ mensur ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/academic_fencing#modern_mensur ) . 
  this is the [ protection ] ( http://www.thuringia-braunschweig.de/images/th/mensur.jpg ) they wear and a [ guy after the fight ] ( https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l_e7c7vn82e/tjm4ckkcaoi/aaaaaaaaea8/y0himsbiees/s1600/mensur%2btajo.jpg ) the scar is called * schmiss * in german . 
  here 's a [ high ranking fp\u00d6 guy ] ( https://images.derstandard.at/2013/04/24/1363839722012-moelzer.jpg ) with the scar on his cheek . 
  in austria us-style fraternities may not be as common , because people do n't live on campus or near the university as much . 
  many students live in apartments all over the city and do their own thing . 
  we also do n't depend on fraternities for partying , because we can go to clubs/bars/etc at 18 . 
  there are also student dorms around the city , but they 're independent of the university and people ( m/f ) from different unis live there . 
  your student dorm is where your community is and where the cheaper drinking is . 
  in vienna , many people choose their dorms based on which state they 're from , and might know many people from high school or other activities in their home state . 
  however , there are [ burschenschaften ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burschenschaft ) in at , de , ch , which are strictly male , extremely conservative , [ traditional ] ( http://www.heute.at/storage/pic/bilder/news/wien/871668_1_2805_burschenschaft02_pd.jpg?version=1401214773 ) , very elitist , pretty right-wing and nationalistic , and sometimes borderline nazi . 
  most of them you ca n't join unless you 're ethnic german . 
  much of the leadership of our right wing party are proud members of these . 
  it 's considered a lifetime membership , and you go to meetings a few times a year ( if you can ) . 
  [ another pic ] ( http://diepresse.com/images/uploads/0/4/7/1491015/6864d3bd-82ce-4b4b-b496-5673f7d84d66_v0_h.jpg ) not very pleasant people . 
   latvia it 's rare to see anyone cleaning up after their dog at all . 
  we did n't do it in austria , either . 
  ~ 10 years ago they passed laws and a little later started to enforce them . 
  first some people complained , but now it 's pretty standard and people accept it . 
  same with `` no smoking '' - laws . 
  first there 's an outrage , then people get used to it and then it becomes normal . 
  it 's a mix of people not littering , enough trash cans ( e.g. 
  every 50m on busy streets ) , and the city cleaning every night . 
  there 's also a ~ 50 $ fine for littering or throwing cigarettes on the ground . 
  vienna also spends a lot on keeping sidewalks and streets in shape , which can also give the city a cleaner look . 
  i 've heard people call vienna clean , but it 's even cleaner in scandinavia and switzerland . 
  it also depends a little on where in the city you are . 
  they 'll usually keep the touristy and `` iconic '' areas very clean , but other areas might not get as much attention . 
  all depends on how much money you are willing/able to spend on cleaning . 
  in austria you can pretty much say what you want . 
  notable exceptions to us-style freedom of speech is that you ca n't distribute nazi propaganda , wave swastika flags or deny the holocaust . 
  afaik , flag burning ( our own and other countries ) is illegal here . 
  we also have laws against [ hate speech ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech ) . 
  my country 's laws are n't listed , but they 're pretty similar to the [ hate speech laws in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech#germany ) . 
  i fully support these laws , as they do n't restrict anyone in expressing any opinion in a civilized manner . 
  the nazi-laws might be an exception , but they were necessary after wwii and i think we should keep them . 
  on a side note : i find the american debate about freedom of speech quite silly sometimes , as there are numerous restrictions to it . 
  for example , showing breasts or saying `` shit '' on tv . 
  personally , i 'd rather not be allowed to burn flags ( never felt the urge to ) but * be * allowed to drink a beer in public at 5 in the afternoon . 
  that 's my understanding of freedom . 
   if americans feel differently , that 's perfectly fine and they can have/make the laws that they choose in their country . 
  i just happen to see it differently and most austrians would agree , i think . 
  wow , you know your trash-talk . 
  * ( maybe more of a personal view than representative of austria ) * ** hungary ** : i grew up 5 km from hungary , so i 've always felt close to it . 
  if you know vienna and go to budapest , the shared history is so obvious and everything feels very familiar . 
  i also like the geography , because it 's just as flat as my home state . 
  my state used to be part of hungary and my grandma 's birth certificate is in hungarian . 
  i loved that they were the first ones to open the border during communist times ( 1989 ) . 
  generally , they seem a little more laid back than austrians , and i like that !, 
  gulyas is the favorite dish at many parties in austria . 
  ** slovenia ** : i 'm from a village with a croatian minority ( dating back ~ 400 years ) . 
  i do n't speak much of the language , but the old people spoke it all the time when i was a kid , so there 's another connection to the countries of former yugoslavia ( sorry for generalizing ) . 
  my grandpa was born in maribor . 
  one of the first holidays i remember as a kid was to slovenia ( postojna caves ) . 
  i fully supported the slovenians in their fight for [ bilingual town name signs ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/ludmannsdorf_%28ortstafel%29.jpg/220px-ludmannsdorf_%28ortstafel%29.jpg ) against our populist shithead haider . 
  i think they cooperated well with us during the refugee crisis . 
  i think they were also very smart to inject a spy into the family of the future us president * ( kidding ) * . 
  ** czech republic ** : thank you for kafka , who we claim for us . 
   prague is a great city . 
  if i go back far enough in my family tree , there are even some people from then bohemia ( ~ 1830 ) . 
  i like that they rose up in 1968 and am a big fan of vaclav havel . 
  ** slovakia ** : have only been there once , but met a few awfully nice people . 
  they seemed to really appreciate we 're visiting the country and showed us around the area . 
  i knew a few slovak students in university and they seemed way smarter than me . 
   * ( for all the eastern neighbors i can say , i am always impressed and a little embarrassed by how well they speak german . 
  i usually start in english , but they always switch to german and it works . 
  ) * ** italy : ** incredible history and cultural accomplishments . 
  definitely one of the countries that shaped european history for centuries and an icon of european culture . 
  i sympathize very much with the mediterranean lifestyle and like that italy seems to be one of the countries fighting for social-democratic policies . 
  also , pizza and some incredibly beautiful sports cars , that are unrivaled in design and elegance . 
  ** switzerland ** : feels close and distant at the same time . 
  i love language and dialects , and the swiss ones are very interesting from a linguistic standpoint . 
  one can only respect how they have navigated the centuries avoiding wwi and wwii and basically doing their own thing in the heart of a warmongering continent . 
  switzerland might the country that is seen most favorably by austrians in general , but i 'm speculating . 
  would love to go there more often , but usually get stuck in the austrian alps that are half the price and just as beautiful . 
  :p ** liechtenstein ** : i 've been to vaduz as a kid with my parents , but that 's all i can say . 
  i 'm sure they 're nice people , though . 
  ** germany ** : here goes . 
  contrary to popular opinion/stereotype , i 'm a big fan of germany . 
  having a large neighbor with the same language makes your own ( german speaking ) world much bigger . 
  thanks to them we have dubbing and a large variety of german speaking media ( books , magazines , tv , websites ) . 
  bavarians feel like part-austrian anyway , but the rest are just as cool .
