  they 've contributed to european culture a lot ( bach , beethoven , reformation ) . 
  we 've been in some terrible wars together and afterwards germany always took the blame . 
  * ( kidding ) * i can not stress enough how well germany has handled the aftermath of wwii , and how much the country managed to turn itself around while fully admitting all its mistakes and still keeping the memory alive . 
  i ca n't think of any country that has done this that well and germany is on good terms with its neighbors , even france and poland . 
  and , of course , israel . 
  i also like that they are the doves in european politics . 
  also , deep respect how east germans got rid of the socialist leaders and ended soviet rule without a shot being fired . 
  german reunification was handled pretty well and may be unique in modern history . 
  they seem to be more level-headed than us in many ways , and their public debate seems a little more mature than ours . 
  they appear to be a modern country and the image the world has of them has significantly improved . 
  and they have a great anthem , which once used to be ours . 
  eu-us relations are by far not the top priority of the electorate in most european countries ( that i know of ) . 
  i 've never heard it being brought up ( significantly ) in austria or germany . 
  our election campaigns are mainly about domestic issues , and about the eu . 
  not much foreign policy , ime . 
  you 're also generalizing too much . 
  europe is n't one country and the electorates in those countries have different views on different things . 
  if you want equally broad and possibly unanswerable questions : * if americans are against racism , why do they keep electing politicians that do n't address the problem ? 
  * if congress has a < 20 % approval rating , why do americans keep reelecting incumbents at a rate  90 % ? 
  * ( i 'm not looking for answers to these questions , just trying to make a point . 
  * lyewb * ( ` ew ' as in ` new ' ) * lyana * ( ` a ' as in ` car ' ), 
  germany i think . 
  we often feel insignificant next to them , but you ca n't beat a common language and culture . 
  and there is the extra-special relationship with [ south tyrol ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_tyrol ) which is part of italy . 
  i really enjoyed the van gogh museum in amsterdam . 
  we were n't exactly an ally , but i can tell you how austria ( mis ) handled the issue . 
  the official/legal standpoint post wwii was that austria was nazi-germany 's first victim ( as stated by the allies in the [ moscow declaration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moscow_declarations#declaration_on_austria ) ) . 
  the austrian state ceased to exist after the anschluss ( annexation ) and can therefore not be made responsible for the crimes committed during wwii . 
  this position is nowadays called [ victim theory ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/victim_theory ) or * victim myth * . 
  our position changed in the 1980s and in 1991 chancellor vranitzy `` was the first official representative of austria who confessed the crimes committed by austrians and asked for forgiveness . '', 
  my own translation : * there is a ( shared ) responsibility for the suffering , that was brought to other people and peoples , not by austria as a state , but by citizens of this country . 
  [ ... ] we recognize/admit all the deeds/actions of our history [ ... ] and as much as we claim the good ones for us , we must also apologize for the bad ones - [ we apologize ] to the survivors and the descendants of the dead . 
  * it took another decade or so , but around the year 2000 austria started paying reparations to forced laborers and began returning assets to the rightful owners or their heirs , if they made claims . 
  this included real estate and quite a few ( valuable ) pieces of art , that had ended up in austrian museums post wwii . 
  there are reruns on tv all the time on german channels , but i would n't call it * as * mainstream as in the us . 
  there is certainly a fan base for sci fi in general . 
  most people would know the character `` captain kirk '' from back when there were n't as many different tv-shows , but you would n't hear your average austrian johann reference star trek . 
  the movies are advertised here as much as everywhere else and people go see them , but hardcore experts on the whole history of star trek ( tv + movies ) are much rarer than in the us . 
  edit : some people might not even make the connection between the recent movies and the original star trek tv series . 
  the original series was called `` raumschiff enterprise '' ( spaceship enterprise ) in germany/austria/switzerland . 
  the recent movies are called `` star trek '' + title . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  rumsfeld said `` old europe '' and `` new europe '' in his speech . 
  nobody was using that terminology at the time , so it 's attributed to him . 
  what are you reading into this statement that seems to offend you ? 
  there 's no judging there . 
  it 's just a quote by rumsfeld . 
  period . 
  just like `` axis of evil '' is a quote by bush . 
  just a fact . 
  he * did * make up the term . 
  we do n't use it `` officially '' , just ironically . 
  that 's not even blaming , just stating the facts . 
  yes . 
  i just saw a report about this . 
  they hire whites for presentations to give themselves a `` western '' look . 
  it 's almost like real-life acting jobs . 
  sometimes you play a doctor , sometimes an engineer , sometimes you just stand there . 
  i think it was an episode of vice ( hbo ) , probably the current ( 4th ) season . 
  yeah , i forgot about jobbik . 
  they 're a scary bunch . 
  whenever a `` political '' party starts to wear uniforms and walk around in formation , it brings back some dark memories here . 
  : / i wonder what the `` brain drain '' will bring for some of the eastern countries . 
  in the short run , it 's obviously bad , but if you somehow managed to bring them back in the future , you 'd have a lot of people with a good education and `` western '' work experience , so there might be some potential there . 
  not sure if that can work . 
  you got the wrong impression . 
  we took about 100,000 refugees and wanted others to do their share , according to eu quotas . 
  our position switched , when the `` flow '' did n't seem to end , eu-quotas did n't work , and when it started becoming a permanent situation , which is obviously impossible . 
   they cross the border every day on the commute . 
  yep , that 's my border crossing . 
   we were * very * happy when the border was abandoned and you could just drive through . 
   then there was new hope in 2004 when we joined the eu but corrupt and incompetent politicians ruined it for us :( i 'm not sure when ( maybe 2004 ? 
  ) , but i heard a projection that it would take ~ 30 years for hungary to fully catch up with western european gdp-levels . 
  i do n't have enough knowledge as to * why * some are doing better ( slo , pl ) , but i 've heard that currently foreign investors are not too happy with hungary . 
  like you said , corruption , and also rule of law . 
  question : what 's up with the opposition in hungary ? 
  i do n't even want to bash orban , but usually parties do n't keep a two-thirds majority for that long , unless they perform extremely well . 
  * bit of a longer post , because i 'm from the border area : * so before the collapse of communism ( when i was a kid ) it was `` mysterious land '' . 
  i went there a few times with my parents ( sopron , hu ) , and the wealth gap was huge . 
  the border guards with machine guns and the watchtowers made it creepy for a kid . 
  when the curtain came down , the old system was visible for many more years in the lada cars that smelled pretty bad , because of the fuel they used . 
  for quite a while , eastern europe was considered `` dangerous '' , and there were urban legends that a guy went to budapest and woke up without his kidneys . 
  ( i am * not * joking , an aunt warned me about this when i went to budapest in 1996 . ), 
  by the end of the 1990s , the border areas in hungary had become popular day trip destinations for east austrians , and to get cigarettes . 
  vice versa hungarians had started coming to work in austria , often for day-to-day work and paid under the table . 
  in eastern austria , `` get a hungarian '' was said like they say `` just hire a mexican '' in the us . 
  so in a way , people looked down on them , but most people appreciated and respected them . 
  i myself often went to sopron to go out on weekends , but rarely met locals . 
  when the eu expanded ( 2004 ) , the right-wingers fearmongered that we 'll be flooded with cheap labor . 
  did n't happen , but in eastern austria ( burgenland ) entire industries depend on legal ( ! ), 
  employees from hungary ( tourism , restaurants , vineyards ) , and i think the hungarian employees have a very good reputation by now . 
  arrogant people might still look down on eastern europeans , but they look down on everyone , so who cares . 
  austrian companies are heavily invested in eastern europe and especially vienna and bratislava have strong economic ties . 
  some of the old stereotypes might survive ( poor , inefficient , stealing ) but that 's just the human condition . 
  we have stereotypes about everyone and everyone about us , so forget it . 
  in eastern austria , there is sometimes ( perceived ) increased crime , mostly burglaries . 
  these are generally attributed to `` eastern european gangs '' . 
  in that sense , there is still the feeling that the `` rule of law '' might not be up to standard in eastern europe . 
  many people think that if you know the right cop or pay the right amount , things can be settled outside of court . 
   politically , we are not big fans of orban ( although the right wing loves him ) and pis , and during the refugee crisis the v4 were seen as `` not helping , just taking '' .
