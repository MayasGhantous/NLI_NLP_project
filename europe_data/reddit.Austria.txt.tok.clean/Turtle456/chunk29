  but again , some people praised them because they were against refugees in austria , too . 
  lake balaton , hu and croatia are popular holiday destinations with austrians now , and vienna gets a lot of tourism from eastern europe , especially around christmas . 
  personally , i love eastern europe . 
  i find it 's calmer , less busy and not quite as regulated as austria or western europe and i find that charming . 
  and , yes , gorgeous women . 
  ________________________________________ tl , dr : many people still think in old east-west terms , but i 've seen a lot of improvement in the last 20 years . 
  especially those in border areas or working directly with our neighbors , have a good opinion of eastern europeans . 
  the furthers away from austria , the more the stereotypes survive ( poland , romania , serbia ) and people think of it as poorer , more criminal , and less rule of law . 
  it may be a long shot , but just try asking in / r/austria . 
  many people there are from vienna , and maybe someone knows someone ( who knows someone ... ) and they can point you in the right direction . 
  maybe there 's even a facebook group of greeks in austria or something . 
  it 's really just a minority of austrians . 
  maybe 35 % . 
  vienna has comparatively low rents . 
  salaries might my lower than in germany , but public services are very good . 
  it 's a 1.8 m people city , so night life is there in many varieties . 
  all we 're missing is an after-hour tradition . 
  i think there are a few greek expats here ( at least there are greek restaurants and shops ) so try to find a fellow countryman who can give you a better idea of what it 's like compared to greece . 
  and for both austria and germany the green party would be considered left of him . 
  at least traditionally , although they 're becoming more left-liberal ( in european terms ) lately . 
  in germany , the `` left party '' ( die linke ) is even further left , afaik . 
  regarding , bernie , he 'd be considered * center-left * ( as are social democrats ) within the political spectrum , because there are other parties to the left of him . 
  so in american terms , that would be moderate . 
  i was an exchange student in portland , or , so i 've only really experienced life as a teenager in the us . 
  - cities are different . 
  portland had a city center , that seemed to be empty after business hours and everybody retreated to the suburbs . 
  this is completely different in europe . 
  the cities are much denser , people live and socialize in the city centers . 
  you walk to your grocery store , there are shopping streets , bars , cafes , etc. 
  it 's possible to live in vienna without a car . 
  i have since visited nyc and dc and they felt more like european cities . 
  - schools serve additional functions in the us , like sports and clubs . 
  in austrian high school , you go to class and you 're done by 2 pm . 
  if you play any sports ( usually soccer ) , you do it with a club that 's not affiliated with the school , but rather with the community . 
  in the countryside where i grew up , every village has a soccer club and that 's where you 'd play and go practice . 
  same goes for other hobbies/activities like chess or playing an instrument . 
  all these are organized locally and independent of the school system , and go way beyond high school age . 
  - life as a minor is different in the us . 
  alcohol is obvious , but even other things were stricter , like rated r movies ( 17 + ) , curfews , or the fact that you 're not even allowed to enter places that sell alcohol . 
  i had a gf in the us and i do n't think it would have been possible for us to rent a hotel room without too many questions being asked . 
  parents also seemed to be stricter regarding dating , `` meeting the guy/girl first '' , etc. 
  also , there is little to no carding for anything in austria . 
  - generally , i think the social fabric between people is stronger in austria than in the us . 
  i do n't mean benefits and the welfare state , but people seem to be more active in various ways in the community . 
  for example , in my village ( ~ 1200 people ) in austria , there was a soccer club , a music band , voluntary firefighters , political organizations , youth clubs , hiking club , and more . 
  people are pretty involved in these and it leads to an `` everyone knows everyone '' - atmosphere . 
  there are also constantly small events where people get together ( parties , soccer matches , village festivals ) . 
  however , i 've never seen life in small-town america , so maybe it 's similar . 
  i did n't get that feeling in the suburbs . 
  - mobility of people is less here . 
  in austria , one grandma lived 5 houses down the street , the other one 20 minutes by car from my house . 
  my host-grandparents in the us lived 3 hours/15 hours by car from my host family . 
  this is pretty anecdotal , though , so ymmv both here and in the us . 
  i love american shows and movies , but the amount of commercials on tv took some getting used to . 
   - grocery stores and malls are bigger in the us . 
  we also have quite limited opening hours in austria . 
  shops close ~ 7pm on weekdays , 6pm on saturdays , and everything is closed on sundays . 
  british english . 
  if you used an `` american '' word your teacher would usually point it out as an `` americanism '' and correct you . 
  in a written test , it would depend on the teacher whether he 'd count is as an error or just let it go . 
  ( technically , it would have been an error . ), 
  however , i grew up pre-internet so kids were n't exposed much to ( american ) english and tv is dubbed here , so american vs. british english was rarely an issue . 
  in university , particularly post graduate , the standard was/is american english , so if you ever got to the point of writing academic papers you 'd have to use american english . 
  fun fact : in austria , we also use austrian german in german class . 
  there are no major differences in spelling to german german , but a few words are different , and using the german word in a written text would be considered an error . 
  the standard dictionary used in schools is called * \u00d6sterreichisches w\u00f6rterbuch * ( austrian dictionary ) . 
   if you were to pick out a highlight in each of the 4 cities you mentioned what would it be ? 
  i was basing my answer mostly on christmas , but these are all `` regular '' tourist destinations as well , so you can do lots of sightseeing . 
  vienna : [ st stephen 's cathedral ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/st._stephen%27s_cathedral,_vienna ) , [ imperial palace ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sch%c3%b6nbrunn_palace ) . 
  here 's a [ list of tourist attractions in vie ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourist_attractions_in_vienna ) and the ones i named are the top two pictures . 
  salzburg : nice little town , [ this castle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hohensalzburg_castle ) , [ main sights in salzburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salzburg#main_sights ) . 
  day trip to [ hallstatt ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hallstatt ) possible and recommended . 
  ( they built a replica of this town in china ! ), 
  beautiful town , [ located in the alps ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/panorama_insbruck4.jpg/1200px-panorama_insbruck4.jpg ) munich : beer gardens , lots of sights and museums . 
  you wo n't get bored in 3 days . 
   edit : i am huge into motorsports , my family would tolerate one or two stops for that . 
  hehe . 
  there wo n't be any motorsports going on that time of year . 
  however , i think the major german automakers have museums that also have old race cars , like the silver arrow , but you 'd have to look these up yourself and where they are . 
  a biased suggestion : 4 days vienna , 3 days salzburg . 
  vienna has one large and many small christmas markets . 
  salzburg would be a nice addition to get a small ( er ) town experience . 
  just google or image search `` vienna/salzburg christmas ( market ) '' and see if it 's for you . 
  warning : 25th and 26th of december are holidays . 
  all shops will be closed . 
  i 'm not sure about tourist attractions , or museums , but you might want to make sure . 
  warning # 2 : do n't expect `` magical winter wonderland '' . 
  the chances for snow are not really high ( based on the last decade or so ) and in the city it lasts for 2 hours max before melting . 
  when my family took trips before christmas , we would go to munich or nuremberg , which also have very nice christmas markets . 
  you could also consider munich ( 3 ) - salzburg ( 2 ) - innsbruck ( 2 ) if you prefer to move around a bit . 
  around innsbruck , chances of some snow are much higher . 
  you wo n't have a problem getting by using english , as all these places get tons of tourists all the time . 
  the locals speak enough english to help you out with basic needs . 
  most young people speak enough english to have real conversations with you . 
  yes , that 's what i meant . 
  valid for exchange at central bank , not as a form of payment . 
  in austria , the national bank also runs a `` euro bus '' , that tours the country and visits all county capitals at least once a year , so that people do n't have to travel to the central bank offices with smaller amounts that they might find around the house . 
  yep . 
  and as for cash : the atms just started giving out euros one night and the currencies were used in parallel for 6 months . 
  prices had to be shown in both currencies for two years after that , iirc .
