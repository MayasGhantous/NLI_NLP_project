  in greece , there is [ mount athos ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mount_athos#visiting_procedure ) . 
  it 's a peninsula with some 20 monasteries and only males are allowed to go there . 
  monks , visitors ( pilgrims ) , even the donkeys used to carry stuff around are all male . 
  access is pretty restricted , you have to claim to be a pilgrim , and only a small number of non-greek-orthodox visitors are allowed each year . 
  i 'm not religious at all and did n't even know about it , but a friend of mine booked us in during a road trip we did to south-eastern europe . 
  you 're asking the 5-million-euro question . 
   there are probably lots of reasons or ( proposed ) explanations , from economics , to `` culture '' , history , politics , etc. 
  personally , i think it went as follows : after the soviet union collapsed , russia failed to open up and modernize their economy/industry/society and a few people got insanely rich in the aftermath of the collapse ( the oligarchs ) . 
  in 2000 , putin came to power and he is former kgb , a cold warrior and probably a russian nationalist . 
  he does n't really believe in democracy and has found an `` agreement '' with the oligarchs to keep the economic status quo . 
  they get to keep their money and companies , he gets political power and they do n't question it . 
  ( well , one guy did and he spent 10 + years in a prison in siberia . 
  [ khodorchovsky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikhail_khodorkovsky ) ) putin 's goal is to stay in power and make russia a global power again . 
  he has no interest in opening up to the west because a ) he does n't believe in western democracy and ( social ) liberalism and b ) it 's always nice for an autocrat to have an outside enemy on which they can blame the country 's problems and against whom he can unite his people ( with a healthy dose of propaganda , of course . ), 
  more generally , the transition from a dictatorship and crippled economy to a western style liberal democracy is n't easy , and many countries struggle with it . 
  for example , hungary and poland are in nato and eu but their current governments are n't big fans of western liberalism ( free press , open society , healthy democracy , etc , etc ) . 
  turkey seems to return to an autocracy after many years of ( slow ) progress towards `` western values '' . 
  western democracy is complicated and often `` annoying '' for those in power . 
  if the right leader at the right time gets a chance to turn a country in the other , more authoritarian direction , they do it , and from there it 's very hard to get back `` on the right track '' . 
  in russia , putin seems to have a firm grip on all branches of government and the media and until that changes or the people rise up , russia will be `` anti-western '' . 
  again , in reality it 's probably way more complex , but that 's the best i can do at this ungodly hour . 
  right , but if so many people share that attitude we end up in the situation depicted in the cartoon . 
  i 'm sure you have at least 5 friends who did n't vote , and if enough people tried to spread the attitude of `` vote , no matter what '' it * would * make a difference . 
  especially with 10 swing states where the difference was only a few percent . 
   if you 're down 10 goals with 2 seconds left , you lose ... and you ca n't win the super bowl if you 're down 27 with 10 minutes to go , right ? 
  i thought , you were ameri * cans * , not ameri * cants * , 
  ... and most recently germany it seems . 
  i 've never seen anyone here treat americans with open hostility . 
  most are usually happy to meet americans and are genuinely interested where exactly they 're from and what life `` is really like '' in the us . 
  there are the stereotypes of crappy food , bad schools and materialism , but at the same time people are aware of and consume the many `` accomplishments '' of american culture . 
  coke , jeans , movies , iphones , etc. , people love it all . 
  i 'd say the negative stereotypes are n't worse than those people have of other countries/cultures . 
   i did n't vote . 
  the mathematical side of my brain is like , `` it does n't matter . 
  you cast a tie-breaking vote in a system that does n't produce ties . '', 
  that 's pragmatism . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/qbhsw6s5jcoy.jpg ), 
   yeah i guess i meant wanting to do it as a younger person and then doing it later on in your youth . 
  i see what you mean . 
  is `` the great american road trip '' mystified ( right word ? ), 
  as much in europe ? 
  i think not as much as in the us but it 's not unheard of . 
  i think the equivalent of `` ultimate freedom '' for european teens is interrail ( at least it was for me ) or backpacking in other world regions . 
  the brits have their `` gap year '' and i met tons of them in se asia . 
  like someone else wrote , route 66 is quite popular here , especially with bikers . 
  however , you have to keep in mind that ( besides money ) many people have time constraints for vacations , so many people would rather visit boston-nyc-dc in two weeks rather than spending too much time driving . 
  the other popular destination is the west coast , eg . 
  la , sf , las vegas , so if you want to consider that a road trip , i think it would be the most common one europeans do . 
  travel enthusiast here , and no - * young * people ( that i know of ) usually do n't have a us road trip on their list . 
  a ) it 's difficult to rent a car in the us if you 're under 21 ( or 25 ) b ) it 's expensive , so it 's usually not something you do at a young age . 
  most people i know of visited the us with their parents who have the money . 
  there are sometimes somewhat affordable package deals , like 5 days nyc or 10 days florida which some of my friends have done . 
  young people in europe often do interrail ( train pass for europe for 1/2/3 months ) or go on pretty cheap 1/2 week trips to the various party locations around the mediterranean ( ibiza , greek islands , croatia ) . 
  those that are into serious backpacking go to south east asia , australia , south america or india . 
  again , the us is not a very good backpacking destination , because expensive and sub par public transport . 
  yes , he can ( and may i say , he should ! ) . 
  the limits on campaign expenditures are only for parties and only during the set time frame . 
  private citizens can do what they want and could even start their own campaigns ( like american superpacs ) . 
  i just mentioned in r/austria that it 's interesting that private initiatives for campaigns are n't really common in austria as opposed to the us . 
  i 'm still waiting what other people think about this . 
  i do n't really have a definitive explanation as to why we do n't campaign for months and with hundreds of millions of dollars like in the us . 
  my best guess right now is that for some reason it 's considered ineffective . 
  what constitutes campaigning ? 
  i 'm trying to give you the full list from the legal text . 
  tl , dr : everything !, 
  - ) billboards ( those are very popular and ubiquitous in austria . 
  smaller than in the us , and on walls of houses , next to roads , at intersections ) - ) direct mail or mail addressed to `` any household '' - ) brochures - ) `` campaign gifts '' ( also very popular ; often lighters , pens , balloons for kids ) - ) advertisements in print media ( newspapers , magazines ) , radio , or tv - ) ads in movie theaters - ) party owned media ( like a monthly magazine for members ) - ) online presence ( webpage , facebook , online ads ) - ) cost of companies hired for campaigns ( ad-agency , web-designers , call-centers , event organizers ( eg for rallies ) ) - ) additional cost for employees ( like paying them overtime during campaigns ) - ) cost for people hired for campaigning ( like musicians at rallies , people handing out flyers in malls , etc ) ____________________________________________________________ thanks for the english lesson . 
  of course , i already knew it . 
  i had the same experience in the us . 
  we once drove 3 hours one way to visit family and have lunch . 
  we did n't do it often , but still . 
  by austrian standards , 3 hours driving means going on vacation . 
   there is a similar effect when visiting different cities . 
  in vienna , a subway ride of about 30 minutes is considered `` ok '' , less is more common . 
  whenever i visit really large cities ( like london or ny ) the duration of subway rides - sometimes 1 hour or more - drives me crazy . 
  sorry for the late response . 
  i had to double-check my previous statement and asked about the legal situation in r/austria . 
  the only response i got was a link to the austrian `` law information system '' and if there 's one thing i hate , it 's reading legal texts . 
  : / anyway , i was wrong . 
  all the regulations regarding campaigning are actual law , and even `` constitutional law '' , i.e. 
  part of the constitution . 
  mind you , the constitution in austria is treated a little differently from the us and it can be `` amended '' by a 2/3 majority in the parliament . 
  for decades , the mps of the two largest parties alone were enough to secure the 2/3 majority , so our constitution was and is constantly amended . 
  atm , 3 parties are needed , but even that is n't that big a deal for many issues . 
  so the law places limitations on money spent on `` campaigning '' between a set date ( ~ 7 weeks before the election ) and the election . 
  in that period , each party can spend a maximum of $ 7 million on `` campaigning '' . 
  how does this work with freedom of speech ( which we obviously also have here ) . 
  i am not 100 % sure , but either we simply say money is n't equal to speech , or we make an exception for campaigning as it 's instrumental for democracy to work , or the law simply stands because it 's in the constitution . 
  in austria , too , if a law is in the constitution , or supreme court ca n't declare it `` unconstitutional '' . 
  now why do the parties pass such laws ? 
  i think there is a ) an `` ethical consensus '' in austria that money should n't rule elections and b ) i think even the large parties are suspicious of each other , i.e. 
  even the large parties are afraid of the other finding a way to massively outspend them . 
  that 's why even the bigger parties are interested in a level playing field . 
  [ edit : another reason why limiting is considered `` the right thing '' is because parties in austria are funded by the state , i.e. 
  taxpayer money . ], 
  i assume , conservatives are afraid of union money supporting the left , and the left is worried about corporate money supporting the conservatives . 
  the third large party these days , the right-wing populists , are not as well funded because many potential donors still do n't want to be associated with them , so that 's why they are in the boat when voting for campaign regulations . 
  afaik in austria length of campaigns and the maximum on money spent are n't set by law either . 
  they are just agreements between the parties . 
  i think the parties like it because their resources are limited anyway and this saves them money and levels the playing field a little .
