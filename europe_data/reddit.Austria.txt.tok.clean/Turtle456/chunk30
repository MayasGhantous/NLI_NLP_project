  the old currencies ( the notes/coins in circulation at the time ) are valid indefinitely ( at least in austria ) and you can still go to the national bank and exchange it for euros . 
  honestly , i do n't know enough about the subject to give an educated opinion . 
  just want to suggest / r/history or / r/askhistorians , in case you did n't know these subs . 
  germany . 
  they think they 're so much bigger and better and represent the german speaking world , while austria is actually `` the better germany '' , as we like to say . 
  they think they can make jokes about us for being a small , rural country , while in reality we laugh about * them * because we have much more culture and are much better at skiing . 
   tl , dr : we have an inferiority complex towards germany , while at the same time feeling superior to them . 
  it 's a strange condition . 
  i 'll say all the james bond movies , but just to annoy my british friends . 
   american movies : too many to name . 
  * pulp fiction * is a great movie . 
  not really my genre , but for some reason i really like * terminator ii * - still does n't seem old after  20 years . 
  probably the masterful acting by my fellow countryman . 
   i 'm a big comedy fan , so i 'm gon na list * some like it hot * , * airplane !, 
  * , * groundhog day * , and * hot shots * . 
  i know it 's not great film making , but i just like to laugh , so there you go . 
  well , you would n't find them like that in western europe . 
  even in small villages here everyone has a car , there are street lights , supermarkets and what not . 
  in the romanian countryside , i often had to think of my grandparents and imagined that this is what life must have been like when they grew up in the 1930s . 
  immersion may be a little difficult , though , as you can barely communicate with locals . 
  in the cities , the few young people i talked to spoke very good english and i 'm sure it would be fun to hang out/go out with them . 
  that 's a tough one . 
  you could probably ask this question about every country and even in small countries like mine , there are `` hidden gems '' that many austrians wo n't know about . 
  some tiny valley in the alps , a lake that does n't get much/any tourism , etc. 
  for a broader answer i 'd say : * romania * . 
  i 've only been there twice on sorta road-trips , but always found it stunning . 
  aside from scenery , cheap prices , and drop-dead-gorgeous women , i found that it 's almost a bit like traveling back in time . 
  there are some villages that have barely any paved roads . 
  people walking in the middle of the street because they 'll see ten cars tops every day . 
  old women selling fruits/vegetables directly from the field by the road . 
  i even saw horse-drawn carriages a few times ( 2008 ) . 
  i also found it very relaxing and it seemed like modern civilization had n't really arrived outside of the bigger cities . 
  no supermarket chains , very little advertising ( except a few rusty coke signs ) , and everybody/everything seemed to be moving at a slower pace than in the `` hectic '' west . 
  it was also one of the best night-skies i had ever seen , because there are many areas with practically zero light pollution . 
  i hear it 's also a great destination for hiking in pretty unspoiled nature , and it definitely has some sight-seeing to offer as well , like sibiu , bucharest , or the dracula castle in transylvania . 
  i highly recommend it , and i hope i 'll get to go there again . 
  maybe on a camping/caravaning trip . 
  it would definitely be the kind of place where you could hand a farmer $ 10 and park/sleep on their farm and they 'd probably even make you breakfast with everything fresh from the farm . 
   i 'm asking for yours . 
  no , you 're asking us why a random guy on the internet thinks something . 
  literally nobody in this thread seems to share his opinion . 
  if you want to know , why * that guy * thinks something , you should really ask * him * , or browse his comment history . 
  same here . 
  never heard * anyone * say that , and i 've lived in europe all my life . 
   and who says europeans are n't raised to hate all things american . 
  everyone who 's ever been to europe or knows * anything * about europe . 
  i was n't suggesting any stereotype . 
  i was saying i doubt police work or refugee management are the determining factor if italy is doing good police work , that 's great , but i 'm sure france/germany/belgium are doing their best as well . 
   is it because of better management ( seriously ) ? 
  do you mean better law enforcement or `` management of refugees '' ? 
  i doubt it . 
   or because of the local gang ? 
  not sure what you mean by `` local gang '' . 
   or because terrorism is irrelevant to immigration ? 
  do you mean there is no connection between immigration and terror ? 
  by immigration do you mean `` recent refugees/migrants since 2014 '' or do you mean `` immigration since wwii '' ? 
  if you mean since 2014 , the numbers do n't support a causal relationship . 
  most refugees since 2014 went to austria , germany , and sweden . 
  most of the recent terrorist attacks happened in france , one in brussels . 
  none in austria , none in sweden , a few in germany , the one in munich committed by a german ( dual ) citizen . 
  however , whatever happens you will never be able to prove/disprove causality purely from numbers . 
  police shootings in the us are also up since 2014 ( afaik ) , and they 're most likely not linked to refugees in europe . 
  in austria it also redirects to google.at a while ago , i started using [duckduckgo.com ] ( https://duckduckgo.com ) . 
  it does n't track you and lets you easily select the region you want to use . 
  maybe you guys want to try it . 
  yep , probably very similar all around the world , be it fishing , hunting , mushrooms , or people growing their own vegetables . 
  here are some typical pictures people would take after mushroom picking : [ 1 ] ( http://tubestatic.orf.at/static/images/site/tube/20160726/apathemenbild-schwammerlsuchen--pilzesuchen--pilze-.5491678.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://media05.regionaut.meinbezirk.at/2012/10/03/3102337_preview.jpg?1349278360 ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.mentenwirt.at/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/schwammerlsuche-im-lungau-2.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://media05.regionaut.meinbezirk.at/2012/10/03/3102325_web.jpg?1349277961 ) image # 2 has the spiky lollipop ones . 
  they can get really big , with the head ~ 10 inches in diameter . 
  on image # 4 they are the white ones turned upside down . 
  these are random images i found in the web . 
  if you google/image search `` schwammerlsuche '' , you 'll see many more . 
  `` schwammerl '' is a regional austrian/bavarian word for mushroom , so all the results you 'd get are from that area . 
  and yes , dumplings are delicious . 
  every variation of them . 
  like i said , personally i am not especially into mushroom picking . 
  i 'm not a real foodie either , so to me they all taste very similar , and any mushroom-based dish could actually be made from [ champignons/agaricus ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/champignons ) that you can buy for $ 2/pound in any grocery store . 
   that said , the ones you pick are the ones that ca n't be grown industrially , so they 're somewhat considered a delicacy . 
  the most popular ones here that everyone is looking for are [ steinpilz ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/steinpilze ) , [ pfifferling/chanterelle ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/echter_pfifferling ) , and [ parasol ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/gemeiner_riesenschirmling ) . 
  ( again , i linked the german pages for better pictures . ), 
  we 'd usually fry them ( roll in flour -  roll in eggs -  roll in bread crumbs , then fry ) , or make them into a sauce and serve with [ kn\u00f6del / dumplings ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kn%c3%b6del ) or rice . 
  mushroom sauce is also a side dish of many venison dishes , like wild boar or whatever comes from the forest . 
  chanterelles are a very nice addition to an omelette , too . 
  so i guess mushroom picking is really more about the whole process than the end result . 
  you spend time out in nature , are happy/proud if you find a lot , show off/share them with family or friends , and get to eat something that you do n't eat every day and that 's only seasonal . 
  a little bit like hunting , i suppose , including photos if you had a really successful pick . 
    also really jealous you can drive for a couple hours and be in a whole new country i grew up 10 minutes by car from the hungarian border . 
  used to go there every weekend . 
  actually , since austria is so small , you ca n't even be more than 3 hours from an international border . 
   but believe me , i 'm just as jealous of californians sometimes . 
  sf , pch , beaches , etc. . . 
   for myself , i suspect 99.99 % is a slight exaggeration . 
  surely more than one in 10,000 persons has been affected . 
  depends on your definition of `` affected '' . 
  if you mean `` victim of terrorism or rape committed by a recent refugee '' , then 1 in 10,000 is probably pretty accurate or even too high . 
  if you mean `` inconvenienced at a border crossing '' or `` worried that something might happen in the future '' then the number is obviously higher . 
  either way , we 're nitpicking here and i think my fellow countryman was just trying to make a point that life here is going on just as normal for * almost * everyone , which i can confirm that it is . 
   do tourists take part of this too ?? 
  well , people do n't fly in from other continents , but austrians will happily drive for 2/3 hours to get to good areas if they 're serious pickers , so domestic day-trip tourism , i guess . 
  the state of [ carinthia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carinthia ) is known for good mushroom picking . 
  [ as you see on the map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/k%c3%a4rnten_in_austria.svg/375px-k%c3%a4rnten_in_austria.svg.png ) , carinthia borders slovenia and italy , and there have been cases/times when too many italians came to pick professionally/commercially and to sell them to supermarkets and restaurants all over italy .
