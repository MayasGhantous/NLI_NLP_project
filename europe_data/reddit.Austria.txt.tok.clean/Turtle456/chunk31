  austrians were furious because `` foreigners come to steal * our * mushrooms '' . 
  local politicians came to he rescue and restrictions were put in place as to how many mushrooms a single person is allowed to pick , to make sure it 's all for private rather than commercial use . 
  i think the law states that you can pick in any forest that 's publicly accessible , as long as it 's for personal use . 
  do n't quote me on this , but afaik there are even police checks sometimes in border areas to actually enforce the law . 
  they stop cars and check if you do n't have more than e.g. 
  3 kilos of mushrooms in your trunk . 
  super common . 
  it 's very popular among retirees , but not only those . 
  i must have been over 50 times even though i do n't care much for it , but my grandparents took me when i was a kid , and more recently i 'll join my mom every now and then because she really appreciates it . 
  some people are very secretive about their `` best spots '' and i 've seen people in my family get in ( verbal ) fights over it . 
  like one uncle showing off his basket full of mushrooms he just picked , and another uncle getting pissed off because uncle # 1 wo n't tell him where he found them . 
  in some seasons and/or regions it 's very easy , too . 
  you go for a little walk in the forest ( ~ 2 hours ) and have enough for 2/3 meals for the whole family . 
  and you get to show them off to your neighbors . 
   except the one i mentioned , there are n't any really dangerous ones . 
  some taste bad , but are n't poisonous . 
  either way , experienced pickers rarely pick the wrong ones and most people have books that list all the different types and whether you can eat them .

  eastern austria : usually between -5 \u00b0 c and -10 \u00b0 c in jan/feb . 
  the coldest i 've ever seen around here was -19 \u00b0 c. 
  the lowest temperature ever recorded in austria was -52.6 \u00b0 c ( 1932/uninhabited area/alps ) and -36.6 \u00b0 c ( 1929/inhabited area/northern austria ) . 
  great list . 
  i 'll add : * tote hose * - dead pants : boring , nothing happening here . 
  tl , dr : none really . 
  dangerous animals are not a concern in austria . 
  ___________________________________ * ( i linked the german wiki pages , because they all have better pictures than the corresponding english entries . 
  ) * there 's a snake that 's venomous , [ common european viper ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kreuzotter ) , but i 'm not even sure a bite will kill you . 
  never seen one , except a dead one my dad found when i was little . 
  as a kid , i was often warned about [ hornets ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/hornisse ) but those would n't kill an adult , either . 
  ( unless you 're allergic , then bees and wasps would also be dangerous . ), 
  i 've seen a few hornets nests in and around our garden in the countryside . 
  people with children or those who spend a lot of time in their garden , would probably have such a nest removed , as a precaution . 
  this and last year , there have been a number of [ cow ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/simmentaler_fleckvieh.jpg ) attacks ( not kidding !, 
  ) , because inexperienced/careless hikers get too close to them and they become aggressive . 
  those are rarely fatal , but some people including children have been seriously injured and had to be hospitalized . 
  [ brown bears ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/braunb%c3%a4r ) used to be exterminated in austria . 
  there have been efforts to reintroduce them , but i think there are less than 10 of them in the whole country and they do n't pose a danger to people , unless you 're really unlucky . 
  [ wolves ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolf ) also used to be exterminated , but they are slowly making their way back from former eastern europe ( slovakia , czech republic ) . 
  many people * think * they 're dangerous because of old folk tales , but they 're actually really shy and try to stay away from people as much as possible . 
  [ wild boars ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wildschwein ) can potentially be dangerous when they defend their young but it 's usually only hunters that get attacked because they specifically look for them . 
  never fatal , but it can make the local news on a slow news day in rural areas . 
   if you wanted to get killed by something found in the wild in austria , you should go with [ this mushroom ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/knollenbl%c3%a4tterpilz ) ( amanita phalloides ) . 
  on average maybe one or two people die from these per year . 
  when your parents take you mushroom picking ( right word ? ), 
  as a kid , they 'll make sure you know what these look like and how dangerous they are . 
  last not least : in some years , mosquitoes are dangerous , because they can totally ruin an evening barbecue for everyone . 
  i 'd live [ here ] ( http://www.wvrvcenter.com/images/rv.jpg ) much of the year . 
  i 'd travel between my houses in oregon , socal , florida , and my apartment on the upper east side . 
  would n't drive the rv into manhatten , though . 
   but seriously , southern california would be the most appealing climate-wise , although i would miss european-style city life , i.e. 
  not suburbs , which is mostly found on the east coast , like nyc or dc . 
  i do n't think i 'd be very happy in a red state or in an overly religious region . 
  : / if i had to pick a place , it would be california - or hawaii , for obvious reasons . 
  ianal , so i 'm not sure what exactly is considered `` hate-speech '' in austria , but i can tell you some restrictions we have here that would be protected by free speech in the us . 
  - ) pretty much anything nazi-related is illegal here . 
  swastikas , the nazi salute , yelling sieg heil , and `` distributing national-socialist propaganda '' . 
  it 's also illegal to deny the holocaust . 
  - ) it 's illegal to defile flags ( our own and other countries ) and religious symbols . 
  so no `` flag-burning '' and tearing up bibles/qurans in austria . 
  - ) there is a crime called `` incitement '' ( verhetzung ) which may be similar to `` hate-speech '' . 
  example : a few years ago a right-wing politician was convicted for calling mohammad ( the muslim prophet ) a child molester . 
  i think this law applies if you say those things before more than 15 people ( used to be 150 until recently ) or if you post it on the internet ( e.g. 
  facebook ) . 
  this law would also apply if you call for people to exercise violence against another group , like `` we should kill [ insert group ] . '', 
   do they set acceptable bounds or do they stifle legitimate criticism of cultural and religious practices ? 
  i support all these laws . 
  i am obviously for freedom of speech , but also believe in exercising a certain amount of respect towards each other . 
  there are many ways to express protest in a civilized manner and all of these are legal in austria . 
  so yes , i think our laws set acceptable bounds . 
  any justified criticism is still possible . 
  got it . 
  misread your comment . 
   we are n't idiots like a lot of this subreddit likes to label us . 
  did n't think so . 
  not everyone here is anti-american . 
  really ? 
  i 'd have thought most european immigrants came pre-wwii . 
  i would n't expect there to be many european immigrants still alive . 
  were there any significant groups that immigrated post wwii ? 
  all of this is afaik : visa-free travel is a popular issue with many turkish people , because they have family in europe and often visit them . 
  they want to do that without having to go trough the process of applying for a visa . 
  erdogan fights hard for it , because it ups his popularity with many people . 
  i 've also heard that it has to do a little with `` national pride '' . 
  visa-free travel would mean the eu treats turks `` as equals '' , since europeans can travel to turkey without a visa . 
  i do n't think there are any sinister motives . 
  the people just want it and erdogan wants to gain popularity . 
  it 's just an issue popular with the turkish people , so erdogan wants to up his popularity by fighting for it hard . 
  lots of turks have family in europe who immigrated there in the last decades , so many of them visit europe every now and then and want to do so without having to get a visa . 
  it 's also a bit of `` national pride '' for people , afaik . 
  by allowing visa free travel , turks would be treated as `` equals '' by the eu , since europeans can travel to turkey without a visa .
