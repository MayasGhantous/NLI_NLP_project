  it 's also a bit of `` national pride '' for people , afaik . 
  by allowing visa free travel , turks would be treated as `` equals '' by the eu , since europeans can travel to turkey without a visa . 
  it 's just an issue popular with the turkish people , so erdogan wants to up his popularity by fighting for it hard . 
  lots of turks have family in europe who immigrated there in the last decades , so many of them visit europe every now and then and want to do so without having to get a visa .

  present day austria : no . 
  in austria-hungary ( afaik and not a historian ) , the german-speakers were a privileged group , and i think it was necessary to speak german to get any government jobs , which back then were the nice jobs and also came with a bit of power . 
  after wwi/ii , austria was ethnically homogeneous . 
  everyone was austrian , and either catholic or protestant , but even those two were n't really separated groups . 
  the `` bohemians '' ( today : czech ) that had come to vienna ~ 1900 had fully assimilated and did n't see themselves as a separate group anymore . 
  i think in most of present day europe you will find that the native group ( french in france , germans in germany ) are the dominant ones , but that 's obvious because they are usually  90 % of the population . 
  ethnic groups who immigrated to europe recently ( = post wwii ) usually started at the bottom and have to work their way up over generations . 
  i ca n't think of any examples where immigrants immediately outperformed the native people . 
  that said , i think in austria iranians do pretty well . 
  i think most of them came after the revolution in 1979 and a lot of them were doctors . 
  however , they are n't very many and i do n't think they are even a `` community '' here - at least i do n't know of any parts in vienna that are predominantly iranian . 
  in austria , there are n't any statistics by race/ethnicity either . 
  once someone is a citizen , they 're a citizen and that 's it , so any stats like in the us `` asians outperform whites  latinos  blacks '' just do n't exist here . 
  my personal impression is that the refugees from former yugoslavia who came in the 90s did a little better adapting/assimilating than the turks ( 1970s ) , but they are n't an `` elite ethnic group '' as you asked in your title . 
  today , with the eu and freedom of movement , it 's even hard to tell who is really an immigrant and who is just here to work . 
  since eastern austria/vienna is so close to hungary , czech , slovakia , slovenia , some people live and work in vienna during the week , and go to their home countries on weekends , where they have a house and where they 'll also retire . 
  some send their kids to high school/university here , and who knows where they will end up one day . 
  i think there are also 100.000 german nationals living in austria now , possibly just temporarily and for job opportunities . 
  i do n't think they ever get austrian citizenship , as it 's not necessary to live and work here . 
  hmh , not sure . 
  i watch german and austrian news ( tv , newspaper ) regarding news in these countries . 
  generally , i would recommend `` well-known '' news sources for international news , like the guardian , bbc , or washington post , maybe ? 
  i also watch cnn sometimes , but it can make it seem like the whole world is on fire , because they give 72 hours live coverage to every terrorist attack . 
  generally , i can tell you that the mood in austria and germany ( from what i can tell ) is very calm . 
  nobody is panicking over terrorist attacks or anything . 
  everybody is very `` matter of fact '' , and goes about their lives . 
  the large shooting in munich seems to have been a right-wing extremist not affiliated with islamic terror , so i do n't think that germans are turning against muslims or refugees at the moment . 
  hope this helps . 
  austria took about as many refugees per-capita as germany and i am in support of that . 
  * ( we did the same in 1956 ( hungary ) , 1968 ( czechoslovakia ) in smaller numbers , and in the 1990s with refugees from yugoslavia in even greater numbers . 
  ) * however , we could not have accepted the same number this year or even multiple years . 
  for the time being , we need to make sure that those who are here have shelter , can learn the language , and maybe even find work . 
   i 'm bombarded with fear mongering news opposed to extremely nonchalant approaches to the migrant crisis . 
  change your news source . 
  things are fine , at least in my country . 
  last time i checked , germany was also still operational . 
  i might even go to oktoberfest this year , if my budget allows it . 
   would you let everyone in ? 
  of course not . 
  nobody wants to let everyone in . 
  those that are here deserve a fair asylum hearing . 
  if they 're from syria or iraq , they can stay . 
   ban them completely ? 
  at the moment , there are very few new people coming , so there is effectively a ban , at least on the route turkey-greece-balkans . 
   let them stay until the crisis ends ? 
  yes , refugee status should end when the respective war/crisis is over . 
  those that have learned the language , have a job , and have `` integrated '' ( as we say in german ) can stay even after the war is over , if they choose . 
  i do n't mind . 
   do you feel your country is handling this appropriately ? 
  yes . 
  i supported both the help provided at first , as well as the efforts to stop the `` uncontrolled flow '' when it became obvious that we could not handle it much longer . 
  i do agree that europe can not seem to have `` open doors '' indefinitely and for those not coming from war-torn regions . 
  * ( i should add that i probably speak for a majority of the country , but there is a sizeable minority who disagree and think we should not have taken any refugees . 
  the right-wing party in austria ( fp\u00d6 ) currently polls at  30 % , and they are against any kind of immigration . 
  they will probably win the next parliamentary election in 2018 . 
  i should clarify : by `` left '' in austria i mean the greens and social democrats . 
  we do n't have any party left of them . 
  in germany the `` far '' - left ( die linke ) is also anti-american ( = pro putin ) and so is the far-right ( afd ) . 
  being anti-us/pro-putin is just being `` anti-establishment '' in germany , so that 's why the two agree on this , i suppose . 
    here , the left was furious and the right-wingers loved it . 
    here ihe general feling is reversed . 
  fascinating . 
  funny how these things work in different countries . 
   nah only one arch , alright , i guess the media made too much of it . 
  i saw this article / [ image ] ( http://oekastatic.orf.at/static/images/site/oeka/20160730/grafik_stau.5501037.jpg ) 2 days ago , advising people to basically avoid slovenia on the weekend . 
  ________________________________________________ so what do you think about the visit ? 
  how did your govt justify it or who were the people against it ? 
  here , the left was furious and the right-wingers loved it . 
  we had the same thing . 
  putin came to austria right after the first round of sanctions were put in place . 
  ( the visit had been scheduled long before . ), 
  there was a lot of debate going on . 
  is it ok with the sanctions ? 
  will putin use it as a propaganda opportunity ? 
  will he try to divide the europeans to get the sanctions lifted ? 
  i think the `` general consensus '' , or rather the official position by our govt was `` we should n't stop talking to each other , even if there are diplomatic tensions . '', 
  personally , i do n't even know what to think . 
  i do n't like putin and what happened in ukraine , but i do see the point of `` let 's not lose touch completely . '', 
  i guess my position is : the issue of `` russia vs. 
  the west '' will not be solved by austria or slovenia , but rather by germany , france , and the us . 
  so might as well let him come and visit . 
  what * does * piss me off , though , is the insane security provisions taken . 
  according to reports in austria , half of slovenia 's roads are closed for traffic . 
  i think that 's ridiculous . 
  personally , i think this is just putin requiring the same amount of security as the us president , out of vanity . 
  i would tell these `` world leaders '' : `` you 're welcome to visit , but we 're not shutting down the country while you 're here . 
  it 's up to you . 
  if not , just send us your foreign minister or your ambassador . '', 
   why the vote is n't fair , or just , or worth anything . 
  i 'm not anti-american in any way , but the way the presidential elections are held is really ridiculous . 
  if you vote for a nation-wide office ( = president ) then have a nation-wide election . 
  period . 
  i 'd be super pissed off if i lived in texas as a democrat or in california as a republican . 
  let the states have their power in the senate , no problem .
