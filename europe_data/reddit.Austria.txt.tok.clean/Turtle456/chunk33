  but at least give everyone the same vote in the presidential election . 
  tough to say about `` average '' , because there seem to be two kinds of crowds these days . 
  if you asked a random middle aged person in a village or a small town , they 'd probably know the name of the president , maybe the vp , and that trump and clinton are running in the upcoming elections . 
  people here do n't really know the details of federal vs. state dynamics , and they often forget or at least underestimate the power of congress . 
  keep in mind , that govts in europe usually have a majority in parliament and can pass the laws they `` want '' . 
  many people here overestimate the president 's power and do n't now that congress can actually block a lot of things . 
  however , there 's a crowd of millenials and/or higher educated people who will know much more and sometimes surprisingly much about us politics . 
  in at/de/ch we do n't get any us-shows that are n't dubbed , but jon stewart et . 
  still have/had a sizeable fan base and you could learn a lot if you watched tds regularly . 
  i 've heard that in the nordic countries and nl these shows ( along with late night stuff ) airs on regular tv so they are pretty well informed about current events in us-politics . 
  tl , dr : the `` average '' person , not much besides the prez and what the us does internationally ( military , tpp , state visits ) . 
  millenials and higher educated , sometimes more than the average american . 
  in austria , if such parties are in cities it 's somewhat common to give the future bride/groom a few `` tasks '' to solve on the night out that are supposed to `` embarrass '' them or at least cause a funny situation . 
  i have n't been to many , but just recently i was out with a bunch of guys and a girl with her group came to our table . 
  she said that for `` a small donation '' we could cut a piece out of her shirt . 
  she had scissors and was wearing an old t-shirt ( and a sports bra under it ) and it already had a few wholes in it . 
  i guess that by the end of the night she would be walking around in a totally cut up shirt and super wasted from all the drinks people paid her . 
  so stuff like that . 
  at the actual wedding , we have a custom called `` stealing/kidnapping the bride '' . 
  around 11 or midnight a few people and the bride leave the wedding and go to a different bar/cafe nearby . 
  the groom and his guys then have to search all places in the area until they find them . 
  the groom then has to pay everything that people drank in the other bar during the `` kidnapping '' . 
  this is a tradition i know from rural eastern austria . 
  it works there because small towns/villages usually only have a few pubs so the bride is somewhat easy to find , usually within an hour . 
   i 'm not sure how software jobs work in europe . 
  would getting a master 's be important for professional advancement ? 
  ( this is a very specific question , i know . ), 
  the whole career thing works a little different in europe , afaik and imo . 
  colleges are n't ranked ( by reputation ) as much as in the us , and usually a degree from anywhere will get you an interview at least . 
  college also is n't * as required * in many fields , because education is typically quite a bit better in high schools already . 
  ( not counting fields that * absolutely * require a degree , like law , medicine , of course . ), 
  the it field is a whole different ballgame , anyway . 
  i know quite a few people who started working during their college education , never finished college , and are super successful now in the field . 
  i also know people who got a phd in cs , just because they wanted to work academically , and wanted to have the title . 
  ( it also means an automatic extra ~ $ 500 per month once you start working , but that 's not really the reason to do it , as you probably lost more money by not working the years you were getting your phd . ), 
  anyway , in europe imo it 's really not as important where and how long you went to college . 
  it 's really depends on how you perform in your job later , and anyone can rise up the ranks if they 're good and having a phd does n't automatically make you the boss of anything . 
  getting a masters in cs is also quite common here because a bachelor takes 6 semesters , and the master is just another 3 semesters . 
  so if you like being a student and do n't feel like entering `` the real life '' quite yet , might as well enjoy another 1.5 years in university . 
  if you 're super career aware , then getting a masters is n't necessary here , but it 's nice to have . 
  i really think you should n't see it as a career step , but more like your `` two years abroad '' and as a way of checking out europe and maybe learning a language . 
  more like `` personal growth '' than something essential for a cv . 
  hope this helps . 
  there is the [ schuhplattler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schuhplattler ) - dance in austria/bavaria . 
  it 's done by guys and involves kicking and slapping each others butts . 
  some of the more elaborate choreographies have a slight `` homoerotic '' aspect . 
   here 's some videos [ video1 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpbmdvtpaqy ) . 
  [ video2 ] ( https://youtu.be/dz4mm_re2to?t=31 ) this one gets `` weird '' at 2:33 mins into the video . 
  [ video3 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzmou1hissc ), 
  interesting . 
  in austria , we also do * polterabend * or just * poltern * , but i do n't think we break any porcelain . 
  it just refers to a guy getting drunk with his friends before the wedding , sometimes referred to as his `` last night as a free man '' . 
  in cities , it 's often a pub crawl with a bunch of people . 
  in recent years , women have started doing it , too . 
  i 've been to academic conferences ( cs ) in europe and in the us . 
  from what i remembers , the etiquette is n't much different . 
  all material and talks were in english , the people attending were from all over the world , and there was n't anything particularly italian/american/portuguese about any given conference . 
  sometimes , there were also `` social events '' like dinners or even guided tours to the city or sites nearby , but it 's completely up to you if you want to attend these . 
  outside of talks and during breaks there is usually small-talk about people 's respective fields/projects , just like during breaks in your average larger company , but it 's also ok to keep to yourself , ( pretend to ) read something , or just leave and go to your hotel right after a talk . 
  i just thought of something , considering your young age and academic background : have you thought of/looked at getting a masters degree at a university in europe ? 
  it would be an easier ( ? ), 
  way to get a visa , and would give you a manageable amount of time ( ~ 2 years ) in a country in europe . 
  ( maybe even multiple countries if you can get the degree spread out over multiple universities ) . 
  many europeans do one or two semesters at a uni in another country , and you 'd get in touch with lots of young , open-minded people and it would be easy to make friends , i suppose . 
  note that in european cities you do n't * have to * live on campus or in dorms . 
  many people just live in ( shared ) apartments all over the city , so you would definitely see ` real ' life in the city/country you 're in . 
  i do n't know your financial situation , but it might even be possible to work on the side and pay for parts of your expenses yourself , although that will depend on the type of visa you get . 
  maybe there are scholarships for that in the us ? 
  just an idea you could look into ...

   [ from this  ( http://www.mercer.com/newsroom/western-european-cities-top-quality-of-living-ranking-mercer.html )  despite economic uncertainties , western european cities continue to enjoy some of the highest quality of living worldwide ; they fill seven places in the top-10 list . 
  vienna continues to lead the ranking and has done so in the last seven published rankings . 
  it is followed by zurich ( 2 ) , munich ( 4 ) , dusseldorf ( 6 ) , frankfurt ( 7 ) , geneva ( 8 ) , and copenhagen ( 9 ) . 
  [ ... ]  european cities also dominate the top of the personal safety ranking with luxembourg in the lead , followed by bern , helsinki , and zurich , which are tied for the number-two spot . 
  vienna ranks 5th ; geneva and stockholm are placed jointly in 6th ; and copenhagen , dusseldorf , frankfurt , munich , and nurnberg all share 11th place .

  have n't read it , but it sounds like something you might want to look at : [ best countries to live in europe , 2016 ] ( https://jakubmarian.com/best-countries-to-live-in-europe-in-2016/ ), 
   i have a dry-erase world map pinned up in my room which i mark up with my future plans ( like a super-villain ) . 
  careful there . 
  you said yourself , you look arab . 
  :d  after looking over responses here , i 've circled the netherlands and finland , put question marks over iceland , austria , and denmark . 
  those are all great places . 
  have n't been to iceland and i 'm sure it 's great , but for me it would be a little too far out of the way . 
  i like bigger cities atm ( grew up in the countryside , and can go there anytime , just 1 hour train ride ) and i like being in mainland europe . 
  i can take my car or the train and get to prague , budapest , or germany in a few hours if i feel like it , and i like that . 
  just personal preference i guess . 
   not sure if austrian experiences are potentially indicative of germany . 
  are the countries similar ? 
  yes , and i would go as far as to say that nl , finland , and denmark are n't * that * different either , especially if you 're talking about the cities over 500,000 people . 
  sure , the countries have different languages and there are differences in mentality , but frankly , us millenials have more in common than what separates us . 
  little anecdote : a very good friend of mine , born in egypt , raised in us , eu-passport , lived and worked for an american company in vienna for 3 years , and never really got around to learning german , despite going out 3 nights a week and seemingly hooking up with every other girl in the greater metropolitan area . 
  my point being : the countries in europe are n't that secluded anymore , there 's an international community of expats in every major city . 
  you can get italian , chinese , or american food in every city , drink beer from everywhere and be pretty much the person you want to be . 
  gay vegetarian ? 
  sure . 
  marxist punk-rocker ? 
  introvert museum-nerd ? 
  techno-head ? 
  anything goes really , and i 'm pretty sure that 's the case in all larger cities in western europe . 
  i 'm sure there are different vibes in different cities , but in the end , you lead the life that you want .
