  so i 'd say the difference in living in hamburg , berlin , cologne , munich , vienna ( at ) , or z\u00fcrich ( ch ) , is the same difference as between seattle , nyc , la , toronto , houston , and dc . 
  make of that information what you will . 
   some of the stereotypes and generalizations about austria and germany remind me a little of us and canada . 
  austrians are polite , rural people in their small insignificant country ( canada ) , and germans are self-confident , sometimes obnoxious , and the most powerful country in europe ( us ) . 
  that said , 100.000 germans live in vienna and all those i 've met , love it here . 
  in your field of it , it might even be possible to get a job as an english speaker . 
  i 've heard it 's a problem in germany , but i bet it would work in vienna , a'dam , and copenhagen , at least in the beginning until you 've got the language figured out . 
  as someone said in another comment , you may find europeans a little more reserved than americans ( i lived there for a year . ), 
  and it will take a little getting used to and maybe even change on your side , but even we as europeans have that towards each other . 
  eventually , you 'll find people you like hanging out with , and even i as an austrian ca n't stand about 50 % of the people i work with . 
   also , do n't base your decision just on the replies in this sub . 
  i would really suggest taking an extended vacation to some of the cities you 're interested in . 
  grab a backpack , get a eurail ticket , and spend 2 months here . 
  maybe you fall in love with a place right away and no further discussion is necessary . 
  allright , different countries , different systems , i guess . 
  yeah , that 's a different concept , though . 
  there are college sports leagues in the us ( ncaa ) , and afaik you can get into colleges in the us based purely on your abilities in sports . 
  i 've never heard of anything like that existing in europe . 
  at least in football you 'd most likely play professionally at that age if you 're any good . 
  i think you 're talking about govt/state support for people who do niche sports where you ca n't make enough money to actually support yourself . 
  i think in austria this is done via the army in many cases . 
  like the athletes are officially employed by the army but can use most of their time to practice . 
  it 's nearly non-existent . 
  i 've never met anyone doing wrestling and have never seen it televised , unless on the dedicated sports channels during the olympics maybe . 
  also , in europe sports does n't happen in schools the way it does in the us . 
  if you play a sport , you do it with a club in your city/village/community and you go to practice after school in the afternoon or evening . 
  there are no high school sports leagues like in the us , and even less so in college . 
  no sports scholarships either , afaik . 
  there are however , amateur sports clubs for different sports in larger towns and football ( soccer ) clubs in nearly every tiny village . 
  ( speaking about austria , but presumably it 's similar in much of europe . ), 
  while i do agree with you regarding turks or other immigrant groups , i think this has a lot to do with these groups being large , living close together , and also actively trying to preserve their turkish/foreign identity . 
  many turks do n't even call themselves austrian , despite being 3rd generation . 
  ( this is vastly different from many immigrants to the us , who will proudly call themselves `` american '' the second they have citizenship . ), 
  i think op would not face this issue as much , since he will be just 1 person , and wo n't be living in an `` american '' community/part of town . 
  if he actively seeks to make local friends , learn the language , etc. 
  i think he would be welcomed in most countries . 
  if he were to marry a local , and the kids grew up in [ insert country ] , they 'd most likely be considered locals . 
  op himself would probably be considered an immigrant from america [ or naturalized citizen ] but that 's in no way a bad thing , imo . 
  i must say i 'm impressed by the many nice responses you got from my fellow europeans . 
  i 'll try not to repeat what others have said , just want to confirm that imo you would n't be seen as `` brown '' or `` indian '' here , but rather as an american . 
  that would most likely be what `` defines '' you as an immigrant to europe , and imo that would make you the `` good '' kind of immigrant . 
  ( referring to your terminology , that definitely also exists in europe . ), 
  if you like the `` socialist '' thing you could also look at austria . 
  we 're not a super cosmopolitan people , but vienna is large enough to call itself a major european city ( ~ 1.8 m ) and ime it 's a great place to live . 
  coincidentally , i just started a thread in / r/austria asking expats how they enjoy life in austria . 
  [ maybe you want to take a look ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/austria/comments/4v0hm5/expats_living_in_austria_what_do_you_likedislike/ ) . 
  not too many answers yet , but i 'm hoping for more . 
  if you have specific questions about immigration , i have found that people in / r/austria and / r/germany are quite helpful . 
   i do n't really want to be given dirty looks for looking like a syrian refugee when i 'm really an american software engineer . 
  nobody gives a shit . 
  in all major cities in western europe there are people walking around of all different shades . 
  think nyc-ish , although will vary by city and part of town . 
  you would n't stand out at all , and for locals or for members of the arab/immigrant community , details about your clothing style would most likely set you apart . 
  considering you are a sw engineer , you 'd most likely live in parts of town that * do n't * have a large arab community , so i doubt you would often be mistaken for one . 
  and even then , there 's very little racist violence here . 
  a weird look or a stupid comment is the worst you have to fear and it wo n't happen on a regular basis . 
  not more often than a jew wearing a kippa will get a stupid comment in an american city . 
  shit happens , but it 's not a big deal . 
  extra bonus : in no european country will you have to check a `` race '' - box on any form . 
   i 'd have a problem where i do n't know what is a city and what is a town . 
  yep , i have/had the same problem , so i asked in / r/nostupidquestions about a week ago . 
  [ what 's the difference between and city and a town ( in american english ) ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/nostupidquestions/comments/4u3i5l/whats_the_difference_between_a_city_and_a_town_in/ ) seems like americans are n't too sure about it either , but some of the answers are helpful . 
  that 's nice to hear . 
  i agree , but i 'm obviously biased . 
  your comment inspired me to ask expats in / r/austria : [ what do you like/dislike about living here ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/austria/comments/4v0hm5/expats_living_in_austria_what_do_you_likedislike/ ) . 
  would love to hear your opinion !, 
  ( `` libertarian '' is called `` liberal '' in europe , although i doubt european liberals would go as far as american libertarians regarding `` small government '' . ), 
  austria : there has never been a consistently successful liberal party in austria . 
  one was in parliament for 5 years in the 1990s ( `` liberales forum '' ) . 
  recently , a new liberal party was founded ( neos ) and they are currently in parliament ( ~ 6 % ) . 
  germany : [ fdp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_democratic_party_ ( germany \\ ) ) was in parliament ( bundestag ) pretty consistently in post-wwii germany , but afaik mostly below 10 % . 
  however , they were often part of the government , because their mps were needed to reach a majority to put one of the major parties ( spd ( left ) or cdu/csu ( conservative ) ) in power . 
  in the last election , fdp did n't make the 5 % , so they are currently not represented in the bundestag . 
  that 's all i know really - maybe someone from germany can give a more detailed description of them . 
  or check out the wikipedia-link i provided afaik , liberal ideas are more popular in switzerland , but i do n't know enough about them to comment on it . 
  eu : in the european parliament there 's the [ alliance of liberals and democrats for europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_liberals_and_democrats_for_europe_party ) . 
  it 's an alliance of liberal parties in the various member states . 
  the wiki page links to the member parties from different countries . 
  this is a very interesting question , imo . 
  i know that in the us it 's pretty much agreed upon that as soon as you have citizenship you are an american . 
  personally , i like this attitude as it is very welcoming to immigrants . 
  that said , in europe ( including my own country ) many people disagree with that , especially those in favor of the `` rise of the ( populist ) right '' in many european countries . 
  their definition of what it means to be a citizen of [ insert country ] is much stricter and often means you have to be part of the ethnic group * or * at least be a ~ 3rd generation citizen of the country . 
  it 's important to note that post wwii many countries in europe were ethnically/religiously/culturally homogeneous and many countries had just gained their independence as nation states . 
  for some this happened even more recently , if you think of former yugoslavia . 
  most people 's definition of being austrian/polish/hungarian meant being part of that ethnic and cultural group . 
  many western european countries have since seen a lot of immigration ( starting in the 1960s ) and are slowly adopting a more relaxed attitude towards what it means to be german/austrian/dutch , but like i said , there are also those right-wingers in most countries who reject the modern definition of citizenship and will ( in ) directly say , `` unless your great-grandparents are from here , you 'll never be one of us . '', 
  one can only hope that these guys will not get their way in the long run ... my personal take : if you have citizenship , speak the language , and respect our `` western values '' , you 're welcome to call yourself austrian . 
  those values are personal freedom and individual rights , rule of law , democracy , keep religion to yourself and out of politics , etc. 
  myself , i feel more `` european '' than austrian , really . 
  i do n't think it matters whether someone is portuguese , slovenian , finish ; we have much more in common than what separates us , and everyone from another european country is more than welcome to come and live in austria . 
  i really hope that european ( eu ) integration will progress further and we do n't return to nationalistic attitudes . 
  also : every austrian must watch the winter olympics , particularly the skiing events , and support our athletes . 
  til . 
   in `` official '' contexts , tv-news , or newspapers , we would use `` die niederlande '' , but colloquially it 's usually holland . 
  we also do the england instead of gb/uk thing . 
  just laziness , i suppose . 
  is that a big deal ?
