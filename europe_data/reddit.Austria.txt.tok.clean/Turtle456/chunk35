  i think we call it holland most of the time , at least in austria . 
  not sure why , maybe because it 's shorter and does n't require a `` the '' . 
  my apologies , if the dutch do n't like the term . 
  yeah , i agree . 
  this entire thread is quite a train wreck regarding factual information , possibly including my own comment . 
  try the g\u00f6sser radler , though . 
  it 's not with almdudler as you would get it in bars , but rather with more of a lemon flavor . 
  stiegl also has a radler , i think . 
  they have them all at billa and spar , in 0,5-liter cans . 
  honestly , * just do it * . 
  as a canadian , you can get a 3 month tourist visa on arrival , which would be enough time for a first time experience . 
  just grab a backpack , fly into amsterdam and take it from there . 
  pick a few cities and countries you want to visit and travel around . 
  public transport is excellent in western europe and trains will get you anywhere you want . 
  tons of european teens do it using [ interrail ] ( http://www.interrail.eu/ ) passes . 
  ( i think for non-europeans it 's called eurail . ), 
  if you get in touch with europeans your age via internet , you will probably find , that they 're not * that * different from you . 
  ime there 's more of a social life in europe than in the us ( have n't been to canada ) . 
  there 's more going on in cities , more cafes , more people going out , partly because our cities are more populated as opposed to everyone living in suburbs . 
  i 'd say go to the travel guide section of your local bookstore and start browsing the different countries . 
  then pick a few you 'd like to visit , and do it . 
   you could also sub to / r/travel . 
  it 's not just for europe , and it 's often just people asking specific travel related questions , but there are also lots of photos that people post of their favorite places . 
  that might help you decide where in europe you 'd like to go . 
  try wieselburger , too !, 
  and g\u00f6sser radler ( = beer mixed with lemonade ) . 
  very refreshing in summer !, 
  yeah , i 'm sure austrian beers are sold in larger quantities . 
  local stuff is always ( much ) cheaper than imports . 
  i think the best selling one ( at ) is g\u00f6sser . 
  in vienna , i 'd say it 's ottakringer . 
  however , i 'm pretty sure if you did a survey `` what 's the best beer ? '', 
  budweiser would be the top answer , despite people not willing to spend the money on it all the time . 
  ime if you have people over and stack your fridge with beers , the budweisers are * always * gone first . 
   pendants pedants ? 
  thanks , fixed the link . 
  yeah , i really should watch the movie at some point . 
  i do n't enjoy musicals/music films generally , but almost 20 years after an american first mentioning the film to me , i really should finally see it . 
  accurate : good at skiing . 
  jodeling is a thing , although may be bigger in switzerland . 
  inaccurate : [ sound of music ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_sound_of_music_ ( film \\ ) ) . 
  every american seems to know that movie , but not a single austrian has seen it . 
  there are `` sound of music '' tours around salzburg specifically for americans , but not even the bus drivers driving the tourists around have seen the film . 
  somewhat inaccurate : not all of austria is mountains/alps/lederhosen . 
  there is none of that in vienna which is ( arguably ) the cultural center of austria . 
  in vienna , it 's much more urban / `` metropolitan '' with opera , classical music and imperial history . 
  _____________________________ related : there 's a quite famous quote in austria ( do n't know by who ) . 
  * `` austria 's greatest accomplishment is making the world believe that beethoven was austrian and hitler was german . 
  '' * i guess one could see those as inaccurate stereotypes . 
   death squads they made up some similar crap to fight against obamacare . 
  they called them [ death panels ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_panel ) . 
  ( copyright sarah palin ), 
  i 'm quite happy with austrian beers , but do also enjoy a night out in pubs that sell english beers . 
  i think the one brand that is most highly regarded in austria would be czech [ budweiser ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budweiser_budvar_brewery ) . 
  edit : yep . 
  that wikipedia page says it 's the best selling import beer in austria . 
  i have observed the same thing . 
  knowledge of english tends to get better as you go north and less as you go south in europe . 
  imho the only explanation is how much emphasis is placed on english as a second language in schools . 
  specifically in scandinavia and ~ ~ holland ~ ~ the netherlands , they have the added `` advantage '' of movies/tv not being dubbed . 
  i 'm * not * saying that schools are generally bad in spain/italy/france . 
  just less of an emphasis on english . 
  another interesting `` trend '' i seem to observe ( may just be anecdotal ) : germans pronunciation of english is worse than that of austrians and swiss , despite all of them speaking german as their first language . 
  germans have much stronger accents when speaking english . 
  again , the only explanation i have that less emphasis is put on proper pronunciation in schools . 
  personally , i do n't think it has anything to do with how closely related the languages are , because : finland . 
  also , the eastern europeans are catching up really fast , i.e. 
  the younger generations that grew up post cold war . 
  i 'm often impressed by the english of people from hungary , czech republic , etc. , despite their first languages having zero to do with germanic languages . 
  austria : i have a passport and a drivers license . 
  used to have a student id but am not a student anymore . 
  i used to live near the hungarian border and went there every weekend to go out . 
  for this i would always bring my passport , despite there not being any border checks anymore . 
  it 's still required to have id on you in case they do random checks or if police stopped me in hungary . 
  the drivers license i carry in my wallet and would use it whenever i need id , e.g bank , post office , or when voting . 
  when i was < 18 there was n't any carding in austria for clubs or cigarettes/alcohol . 
  as an austrian citizen , you are * not * required to carry id , but police have the right to take you to the station until your identity is `` determined '' , if they have `` reasonable doubt '' you 're telling the truth . 
  so id is n't required , but comes in handy . 
  that said , i am always puzzled that ( apparently ) some people in the us manage to `` live '' without id ( i 'm referring to recent reports about voter id laws ) . 
  it would be next to impossible to manage your everyday affairs without id in austria . 
  i do n't think anyone would accept a birth certificate as a form of identification ( as i heard is sometimes done in the us . ), 
  there exists a third type of govt-issued photo-id in austria , a * personalausweis * ( personal id ) , which can be used to travel within the eu . 
  it 's a few bucks cheaper than an a passport , but i do n't think many people have one , since pretty much everyone has a passport . 
  fun fact for americans : fake id 's are extremely rare here and very hard to obtain . 
  since there is n't much carding , there is n't really a demand for them , unless you 're planning on committing an actual crime or fraud . 
  internment camps ? 
  absolutely not . 
  this would violate every country 's constitution i can think of . 
  unless there is something like an almost-civil-war breaking out between muslims and non-muslims in europe , i do n't see anything like that happening . 
  that said , racial profiling is already going on in the us , although they would n't admit it . 
  they are definitely taking closer looks at muslims/arabs with their surveillance programs . 
  i 've also heard reports that the number of arab-americans in prisons has gone up significantly based on `` suspicion of terrorism '' , but do n't have a source . 
  a friend of mine ( ethnic egyptian , eu-passport ) is getting `` double-checked '' almost every time he travels to the us for work . 
  whether this is happening in european countries also , i do n't know . 
  i do n't really know much about how the intelligence services operate in the various countries . 
  however , you just * looking * arab , despite being christian and born and raised in europe , is not going to get you on any list . 
  it sucks that people look at you differently now , but i 'm afraid many groups have to deal with that one way or the other . 
  ( blacks , roma , immigrants , ... ) i hope it 'll stop for you again , soon . 
  interesting that they know it in finland and nl . 
  i 've never heard of it in austria .
