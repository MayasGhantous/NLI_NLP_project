  hmh , tough call . 
  it 's common to have a little bit of the neighboring countries , like the west of your map . 
  the north , east and south are a little far zoomed out , i agree . 
  although , since hu is n't making official claims to these regions , i guess it 's fair to include regions where many hungarians live . 
  glad you like it . 
  i 'm very happy with the outcome as well . 
  informative and entertaining was exactly what i was hoping for . 
  well , you all should have stayed with the austrian empire and we would n't have to have these debates right now . 
  we could all be living together in big country under habsburg rule . 
  well , prussia 's successor state is quite beatable , though . 
  france : asterix , louis de funes , * `` libert\u00e9 , egalit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 '' * , metric system germany : techno ( i do n't like techno per se , but other ( sub ) genres of electronic music , which are probably rooted in techno ) , printing press , [ pumuckl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pumuckl ) ( grew up with it ) uk : drum 'n' bass , punk music ( sex pistols , etc. 
  ) , monty python greece : democracy !!, 
  turkey : coffee ( i know they did n't invent it , but according to legend they introduced it to vienna during one of the sieges in the 16th/17th century . ), 
  denmark : lego ( loved it as a kid ) austria : psychology ( freud ) , classical music ( mozart ) least favorite : croatia : ties . 
  ( i find them unnecessary and annoying  ), 
  yeah . 
  the only thing we make fun of them for is their dialect . 
  first , they talk pretty slowly , and second , there are some vowel-shifts in their dialect and they use more * umlauts * ( \u00c4 , \u00d6 , \u00dc ) which often makes other german speakers go * awww , so cute * . 
  for many austrians , the former eastern european countries are popular cheap shopping or day-trip destinations . 
  that 's why bratislava is often jokingly called * `` gratislava '' * ; * gratis * being german for * `` for free '' * . 
   czechs are still sometimes called ` bem ' ( dialect for bohemians ) , but mostly by older people who may have grown up in a time when * bohemian * was still a proper term . 
  ( ~ post wwi and pre wwii ) . 
  the only current czech stereotype i can think of is gorgeous women , but i think that goes for many eastern european countries . 
  since you so kindly also mentioned positives : i think the way you think about austria would be how austrians think about switzerland . 
  i 'm from the east so i 'm not sure how those closer to switzerland actually feel about it , but i think the general attitude in at is `` everything is better in switzerland . '', 
  or `` why ca n't we be more like switzerland ? '', 
  haha . 
  finally i get an in-depth look into the scandinavian animosities i have heard so much about . 
  thanks , that was a fun read !, 
   because they are easy to win next time , we 'll beat you again , just like in cordoba !, 
  austrians * believe * we have a football rivalry with germany , although we were never a real match for them . 
  we only beat them * once * [ in an important game at the world cup 1978 in the city of cordoba ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria_v_west_germany_\\ ( 1978_fifa_world_cup \\ ) ) , but to this day every austrian knows what * cordoba * means . 
  germans have forgotten about it long ago . 
  :d generally , we often call germans * piefke * , which [ originally referred to prussians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_terms_used_for_germans#piefke_.28offensive.29 ) . 
  today , it 's used only jokingly and even germans do n't take it seriously ( ime ) . 
  1 ) i think american food deserves to be on this list . 
  for many people in austria , american cuisine is equal to mcdonald 's and burger king - the only american burger chains that exist in austria . 
  in larger cities , especially vienna , there are definitely ( american themed ) restaurants that serve ` real ' american burgers on a plate , with a choice of toppings , and ` home-made ' fries on the side , but in more rural areas mcd/bk is the only burger you can get . 
  authentic american steak-houses exist , but they 're rare . 
  ( pun intended ) . 
  2 ) many people who have had real chinese food would say that chinese restaurants in austria are an abomination . 
  most dishes are made using a standard sauce that seems to come from the same whole sale supplier . 
  personally , i love the chinese food in austria , but it 's completely different from allegedly ` more authentic ' chinese food that i 've had in the us . 
  ( never been to china . ), 
  i mostly agree with you , and obviously do n't see a major war coming in the foreseeable future . 
  just want to add that smaller wars can still happen over some petty territorial disputes or whatever , without going `` all in '' and harming each others economies . 
  ( theoretically speaking . ), 
  also , i am pretty sure that yugoslavia 's economies were pretty interdependent , but it did n't stop bosnia , serbia , croatia , etc. 
  from going to war with each other . 
  i just quickly looked over the other comments and saw germany mentioned a lot , which is probably the best answer . 
  just wanted to add that austria ( and maybe also switzerland ? ), 
  have a large turkish community as well . 
  vienna in particular is a good place to live , ime . 
  small enough to feel like ' a home ' , big enough to call itself a real city . 
  i know we get a bit of bad press recently because of the right-wingers becoming stronger , but the country is still far from becoming ` undemocratic ' . 
  afaik our immigration laws have become stricter in the last decade but have a look at them . 
  maybe there 's a way for you to come here . 
  since you study languages , maybe look at the [ international organizations that are based in vienna/austria ( e.g. 
  un ) ] ( https://www.wien.gv.at/english/politics/international/organisations/overview.html ) . 
  maybe there are job opportunities for you ... all the best !, 
  that 's right . 
  there can never be enough schwarzeneggers . 
  austria ( pop : 8.8 m ) has 9 federal states . 
  the largest ( by population ) is vienna ( 1.8 m ) , the smallest is burgenland ( 290k ) . 
  the states do n't collect taxes . 
  all taxes are national and are distributed to the national , state , and municipal level by population . 
  the states have some legislative authority , e.g. 
  the building code or the `` youth protection laws '' , so in one state 14 year olds can be out until 11pm , in another until 10:45 pm - ridiculous really and nobody cares anyway . 
  i think the hunting laws are also up to the state , so season starts on the 1st in one state and on the 3rd in another . 
  they are mostly administrative units ( schools , roads ) but people feel pretty attached to their state . 
  it 's sort of an identity you never really give up , even if you move later in life . 
  historically , some of the austrian states date back to the middle ages when they were duchies , shires , or dioceses . 
  if you want to know more details : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria#administrative_divisions fun fact : if you speak german and have lived in austria for long enough , you can tell people from all states apart by their accents , despite austria being relatively small . 
  i thought you might have been mixed or something since you also asked about dual nationality options . 
  in another comment someone asked about ethnicity , too , so i thought i 'd explain . 
  i 'm not a big fan of race/ethnicity questions either . 
   the ethnicity question is totally confusing . 
  * white : light skin ; basically all europeans * latin : latino , hispanic ; from latin-america * black : very dark skin ; from africa * indian : from india , pakistan , or bangladesh * asian : like japanese ; from east asia and south east asia * pacific islander : from hawaii or south pacific * middle eastern : from iran , iraq , gulf states , etc. 
  * inuit : eskimo ; from northern canada * native american : people in america before columbus * indigenous australians : aboriginals * other : non of the above if you 're not sure , or come from a ` border area ' or you 're mixed-race , just pick one that you feel ` closer to ' or pick ` other ' . 
  i do n't think you 're going to mess up the survey . 
  since the classification is pretty arbitrary , in the us they fully switched to ` self-identification ' . 
  you 're basically the race/ethnicity that you say you are . 
  imo , white . 
  latin would refer to people from latin america . 
  i would say 13 or 14 is a pretty standard age in ( rural ) austria . 
  there was definitely drinking at our ` end of middle school ' party . 
  ( age 14 ) . 
  in eastern austria , wine is ubiquitous , but beer is obviously available , too . 
  a very popular drink for kids at that age is * cola-rum * ( coke with rum ) or * cappy-wodka * ( orange juice with vodka ) . 
  south park had a great 2-part episode on what they think about * family guy * and how the show is actually written . 
  season 10 , episodes 3 and 4 . 
  i highly recommend it . 
   i do n't want to spoil but if you 're not going to watch it , take a look at the [ wikipedia entry ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cartoon_wars_part_i ) . 
  i assume the conclusion is explained there . 
  austrian ( watching german tv channels ) : i was born in 1981 and grew up with * lots * of american shows . 
  my favorite was * alf * , but there was also * roseanne * , * the cosby show * , * married with children * , * knight rider * , * macgyver * , * the a-team * , * the waltons * , * flipper * , * wonder years * , * the addams family * , and that [ * batman * tv series ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batman_%28tv_series%29 ) from the 60s . 
  american shows specifically for kids i watched : * flintstones * , * tom and jerry * , * bugs bunny/roadrunner * . 
  however , in the kids-segment there were actually more german/european shows , e.g. 
  cartoons ( japanese-animated ) specifically for the german market . 
  other shows from that time i remember : * dallas * , * falcon crest * , * miami vice * , * columbo ?
