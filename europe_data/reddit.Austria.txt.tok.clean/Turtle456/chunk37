  * , * kojak * , * love boat * , * moonlighting * , * dukes of hazard * , * magnum * . 
  even my parents ( born 1950 ) grew up with a lot of american media . 
  in the times before tv , they would 've seen a lot of the western movies in the theater . 
  john wayne , james dean , etc. 
  were definitely household names back then . 
  older tv shows were also dubbed into german and my parents would have known/watched them , like * black beauty * , * lassie * , * bonanza * , * fury * , the original * star trek * , etc. 
   when did your country start featuring more american content ? 
  i 'd say it was always there to a certain extent . 
  before 1980 the media market was limited . 
  in austria there were only 2 channels , in germany a few more ( all public broadcasting ) , but even those had american content , especially the movies . 
  private/commercial tv started in the early 80s in germany , and as i said above , there were lots of american shows immediately . 
  austria , germany , switzerland : everything is dubbed for the german-speaking market . 
  basically , we get all american movies and tv series that are scripted . 
  especially many sitcoms are hugely successful over here : taahm , himym , bbt , and so are the simpsons . 
  the most notable exceptions to this rule would have been * the office * , * 30 rock * , * arrested development * , and * seinfeld * . 
  ( i do n't know why ; may have been something with the german voices or the humor did n't work . 
  i * love * the office and seinfeld in english , but the dubbed versions are unwatchable . ), 
  i do n't think * curb your enthusiasm * ever aired , and so far i have n't seen * veep * on tv , either . 
  we * do n't * get any of the american late-night talk shows , probably because it would be weird to dub them and could n't be done in such a short time . 
  recently , one german channel started airing `` jimmy fallon '' with subtitles , but i doubt many people watch it . 
  we never got `` the daily show '' or `` colbert report '' , but a few years ago they started a german version of tds and it 's very successful . 
  we * do n't * get snl . 
  we do n't / did n't get * oprah * , * jerry springer * , * ellen * , * maury * , but there are/were similar german shows . 
  not really oprah and ellen , but the maury-type shows used to be very popular in germany . 
  there are/were also german versions of court shows ( like judge judy ) . 
  there is nothing similar to * the view * . 
  stuff like * dr. phil * is inconceivable to me in at/de/ch . 
  there are national ( at , de , ch ) versions of many shows you have in the us , like * bachelor * , * idol * , * the voice * , * who wants to be a millionaire * , although i 'm not sure whether these even originated in the us . 
  heidi klum has a model casting/talent show in germany . 
  there used to be german versions of * jeopardy * , * wheel of fortune * , and * family feud * . 
  i do n't think there was ever anything like * the apprentice * , and we obviously did n't get the us-version either , which is why most people had n't really heard of trump as a tv-personality before . 
  we get all the successful drama shows , like * got * , * hoc * , * walking dead * , but because of the significant delay of the german release , many young people will just download the us-version from the internet before it even airs here . 
  ( this is how i watch some us late-night shows , tds ( not any more ) , snl , and bill maher . ), 
  we also get all the cop/crime and legal shows , like * csi * , * ncis * , * law and order * , etc. 
  notable exception was * the wire * . 
  in my cable package , i get * discovery - * , * history - * , * national geographic * , * travel-channel * , and * a&e * . 
  they are cheaply dubbed but you can switch language and watch them in english . 
  i ca n't be sure , but it seems like the programming is very similar to the us ( just without commercials ) . 
  only history channel seems to have some original german programming as well . 
  we do n't get much us sports , except nfl , of which 2 games per week air with german/austrian commentators . 
  there 's one channel ( only via cable ) * sport 1 us * that shows random games ( with us-commentaries ) from nba , mlb , nhl , and occasionally nascar , indycar , or bowling . 
  the nice thing about this channel is that they will show reruns of eg . 
  nba-games the next day ( since live would be in the middle of the night ) and the reruns are without any commercials or half-time breaks . 
  feel free to ask if you wan na know about a specific show or older shows . 
  do n't be a ` smartass ' . 
   i went to high school in the us for a year , and there were some other exchange students who would constantly lecture americans and complain that ` this or that is sooo much better in their home country ' . 
  needless to say , they were n't the most popular people in school and did n't make many american friends . 
  so my advice : be respectful , do n't complain about local customs or traditions , and do n't try to educate your hosts on how things ` should ' be done ' . 
  show a genuine interest in anything italian and people will love you !, 
  i remember 2004 , when the `` eastward expansion '' happened . 
  personally , i was super enthusiastic . 
  i grew up 5 kilometers from the hungarian border when the iron curtain was still in place and for me , it meant the end of that divide - europe finally becoming one . 
  politically , the right wingers were bitching that we 'll be `` flooded with cheap labor '' . 
  due to these concerns , austria and germany ( and maybe others ? ), 
  put a rule in place that the new member citizens did n't have the right to work in the country for another 7 years . 
  the right bitched again when romania and bulgaria joined and again we were not `` flooded with immigrants '' . 
  i agree that having 28 members is a bit of a problem when it comes to making decisions , but let 's be fair : in the last few years , it was n't the eastern europeans that 'cause d problems ' . 
  iirc , the biggest problems were in spain , portugal , and greece . 
   more exactly including countries that they do not feel close to . 
  as an austrian , i have to disagree . 
  i feel just as close to hungarians and poles , as i do to portugal or finland . 
  i believe everybody should have the right to join , and the answer to the problems is n't making the eu smaller , but designing institutions that work for enough countries . 
  and again , let 's be fair : it 's france , germany , and the other ` big ones ' calling the shots anyway . 
  it 's not latvia or slovakia causing problems for the eu . 
  generally , in austria i hear much more people here complaining about greece , not about eastern europeans . 
  economically , austria has benefited big time from the eastern countries . 
  afaik austria ( companies ) is the largest foreign investor in some eastern european countries . 
  i doubt that anyone in their right mind would support an eu without the east in it . 
  maybe it 's people downvoting each other based on the flags/flair . 
  europeans have fought each other for centuries . 
  why stop now ? 
  believe it or not , but i 've had that american ` wienerschnitzel ' - stuff . 
  the logo looks familiar . 
  we were traveling through california and saw a ` wienerschnitzel ' - restaurant . 
  as austrians , we obviously had to stop and check it out . 
  not too many austria-references in the us , so you have to take what you can get . 
  austria and germany do - big time . 
  it 's called ` grillen ' and there are even regional , national , and international championships . 
   the most popular meat is pork , and the occasional ( regional ) sausage . 
  i do n't cook/bbq myself but lots of people have their ` secret recipe ' for marinating the meat , often 24h before throwing it on the grill . 
  burgers/ground meat is rather rare , but it happens . 
  however , the ultimate delicacy is [ spanferkel ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/spanferkel ) , which is a whole ( small ) pig . 
  this is often done at public events ( fairs , local sports events , etc. ), 
  * or * when enough people get together in private , such as weddings or significant birthdays . 
  it 's delicious , i tell you !, 
  austria : most people do n't want to join . 
  it 's very rarely discussed , as no political party could gain anything from advocating joining nato . 
  our ` neutrality ' is almost part of our national identity . 
  afaik we do participate in something called ` partnership for peace ' . 
  my cousin was actually in afghanistan for a few months - i think we put in some 50 troops to the peacekeeping mission . 
  personally , i am glad that nato exists , because from what i know about the cold war era , austria would have eventually become part of the east bloc if nato had n't existed to counterbalance soviet military power . 
  if the us ever withdrew from europe , i would hope we would set up a similar european defense alliance . 
  / r/murica , 
  hehe . 
  i have n't fully figured it out yet , but apparently * sound of music * is one of those movies americans watch around christmas with the whole family , like * it 's a wonderful life * with jimmy stewart . 
  it 's about an austrian family that flees from the nazis to the us and they become big stars - or something . 
   i 've never heard of it either . 
  this is so rare that i 'm not sure if i can believe it . 
   that is a quick way to spoil everyone 's fun . 
  regarding austria and since an american is asking this : as an austrian , americans will always mention the movie [ sound of music ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_sound_of_music_ ( film \\ ) ) to me , while literally * nobody * in austria has seen that film - we have n't even heard of it .
