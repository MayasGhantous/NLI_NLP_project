  well , pbs already exists and you could model it after many of the european broadcasters , so it is n't a particularly complex problem . 
  but sure , if you 're taking into account `` realistic doability '' in the ( current ) political system , i agree with you . 
  i 've been following us politics for over a decade now and know how easy it is to stop something from happening . 
  and since the reps are against * anything * that increases the size of govt , not much is going to happen anytime soon in terms of the changes you are looking for . 
  in fact , everything is moving in the * opposite * direction atm . 
  : / i 'm still disappointed the dems could n't get done more while they had their supermajority but what can you do ... ps : gerrymandering must stop !, 
  illegal in austria but afaik you can get away with very small amounts ( < 2 or 5 grams ) . 
  police still file a report but courts often drop the charges . 
  there 's no significant debate for legalization/decriminalization going on and police just introduced new drug testing equipment for traffic checks , so i doubt the legal situation will change in the near future . 
  set up a public broadcaster that deserves that name and air quality political information . 
  i think the commercialization of news is a big problem and many americans are n't well informed about politics . 
  people must have the option for in depth and unbiased ( as much as possible ) news . 
  a while ago , a poll found jon stewart to be the most trusted news anchor . 
  that 's an enormous red flag . 
  ( not that jon was n't a genius at what he did , but he was technically a comedy show and the evening news should provide better information than a show on comedy central . ), 
   and belittling religious people . 
  lol . 
  i take it you 're not a big fan . 
  yeah , i 'd say house parties exist , but clubs and bars are more common . 
  also , op , since the drinking age is lower here ( or not even enforced ) teenagers do n't depend on house parties to drink as much as in the us . 
  as a teenager , i only ever had one at my parents ' house . 
  the problem was the entire house smelled like a bar for two weeks from the cigarette smoke , and it 's actually a bigger pain in the ass for everyone to get to some village rather than meeting in the nearest small town . 
  all voting is done on paper ballots , so in the event of doubt , you can always recount . 
  in case of too many irregularities , it 's possible to annul it and redo the entire election ( as happened last year ) . 
  at the voting place , you have to show id , so impersonation is nearly impossible . 
  i ca n't think of any other ways to tamper with an election , so i guess our process is reliable . 
  yes , since western europe is one of the most progressive/liberal places in the world , many immigrants are more conservative than the native population . 
  in austria , the most significant immigrant groups are turks , albanians , serbs , chechens and various `` eastern europeans '' , all of which i would consider more religious and conservative ( on average ) than than the average austrian . 
  you would be fine ( i assume ) in most of western europe , especially in touristy areas and larger cities . 
  in the countryside , you would turn some heads , but would n't experience any open hostilities . 
  being american is n't an issue * at all * . 
  racism against black people does exist , but once you 're identified as an american tourist you would n't have any problems . 
  however , there 's never a guarantee ( for anything ) . 
  is it possible that you run into a bunch of drunk assholes at night in a side-alley and they shout some racial slurs at you ? 
  yes , that can happen . 
  to be fair though , that can also happen to locals if you wear the wrong clothes or the wrong soccer jersey . 
  generally , there are n't too many black people in austria , and most are recent immigrants from africa . 
  you would probably stand out in some places , but i do n't think you would have to fear for your safety anywhere in austria . 
  there was also the [ opec siege ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opec_siege ) in vienna in 1975 . 
  it was done by carlos , a top terrorist at the time . 
  they killed `` only '' three people , but took hostages into a plane and flew them to a number of places in the arab world . 
  for germany , munich is probably the most well known , but the hijacking of the `` landshut '' ( [ lufthansa flight 181 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lufthansa_flight_181 ) ) is also quite significant . 
  three hijackers and the pilot died , but it could have been * much * worse , as they threatened to blow up the entire plane with ~ 90 people in it . 
  * ( it was n't on german soil , but the plane was german and the hijackers demanded the release of prisoners by the german govt . 
  ) * it was a huge success for the german anti-terror unit [ gsg 9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gsg_9 ) which was formed as a reaction to the munich massacre . 
  just want to say that many country/city subs already have a travel wiki . 
  r/austria and r/wien ( vienna ) definitely have one . 
  i do n't think we should try to reinvent the wheel , and maybe link to the existing wikis . 
  we should also tell people to go to r/travel more . 
  not that i 'm against all travel questions here , bit ime an american in r/travel who recently did interrail/eurrail can actually give better info to another american than we can . 
  my last interrail experience was 12 years ago , and i have absolutely no idea about hostel prices in vienna , despite living there . 
  yep , that 's the [ salzkammergut ] ( http://www.austria.info/au/activities/lakes-nature/salzkammergut-lake-district ) lake district . 
  seconded . 
  the other lake region is the [ state of carinthia ] ( http://www.austria.info/au/destinations/provinces/carinthia ) . 
  unfortunately , it goes waaayyy further back than wwii . 
  personally , i blame much of it on christianity/catholic church . 
  an extremely shortened explanation i often give is this . 
  in the middle ages , jews in europe were banned from owning land or working in the trades . 
  the only business they were allowed to work in was the lending of money , because it was considered sinful by the church . 
  over time , this led to ( many ) jews becoming wealthy , good with money and eventually many people owed money to jews . 
  needless to say , people do n't like repaying debt and are often envious of the rich . 
  this led to all the stereotypes ( cheap , usury , rich , only after the money ) . 
  also , whenever jews were expelled from places , many people were happy because they did n't have to repay their debts . 
  again , this is a very short and incomplete version of history , but maybe it helps a little . 
  if you want to learn more about it , [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism#persecutions_in_the_middle_ages ) might be a good start . 
  [ wikipedia2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_the_jews_in_the_middle_ages#accusations_of_ritual_murder.2c_blood_libel_and_host_desecration ), 
  here are the stats on police and deaths i could find . 
  between 2003 and 2013 , 8 officers were killed on duty . 
  in 2011 : police fired total of 81 shots ; 4 directly aimed at people ; 1 person killed by police ; 1 police officer killed . 
  the last time an officer died seems to have been july 2016 . 
  it was the first police death in vienna since 1993 . 
  on average , i would think it 's somewhere between 0.5 and 1 officers killed every year . 
  ______________________________________________________________________ when i researched this , i found [ this page ] ( http://www.corsipo.de/ ) which seems to commemorate police deaths * in germany * , including dates . 
   you must be thinking about people staying past the 90 days to work . 
  i think you 're right . 
  i 've been on a 5 day business trip to the us on the regular visa-waiver program , and iirc on the immigration card there 's even an option `` business '' ( as opposed to `` tourist '' ) . 
  in austria , no . 
   to me this is just such a comical and anachronistic nickname , [ . . ] i do n't find it offensive and i do n't think it 's supposed to be , i just find it funny . 
  to me it would be like calling german 's krauts in a non-sarcastic manner or french people frogs . 
  it can be used offensively , though . 
  i 've heard it used by people in various countries who want an existing us military presence to end . 
  `` yankee , go home ! '', 
  the german equivalent ( on the pacifist left ) is `` ami , go home . '', 
  ( not in austria , because we do n't have any us troops . ), 
  afaik krauts and frogs definitely were derogatory during wwii . 
  i agree , though , that they all sound somewhat dated and there are probably `` better '' words to offend someone from those countries today . 
   my first question is about english speaking . 
  is the english any good or is it just basic sayings ? 
  speaking for austria : in cities and among university students , people speak good to very good english . 
   my second question is where would you people recommend as a country to attend college in ? 
  i am currently looking at the netherlands , austria , germany , and maybe slovakia . 
  if you can find an english study program , vienna is a very nice city to live in . 
  big enough for stuff for stuff to be happening ( nightlife , events , cultural activities ) and small enough to not spend hours every day in transport . 
  bratislava is only 60 minutes away , so if you go to slovakia , you save money , and have good access to vienna as a bonus . 
  germany and nl are great countries , too , so imho you ca n't go wrong with any of those countries . 
   and my final question is about hostilities . 
  so my final question is , is there a violent anti-american sentiment where you are ? 
  zero . 
  you may get shit on the internet , or people protesting the * us government * , but american * citizens * are seen quite favorably here . 
  you do n't need to worry about this issue * at all * .
