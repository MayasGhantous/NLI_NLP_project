   when did you begin formal education in english ? 
  5th year of school , so at age 10/11 . 
  iirc english is part of the curriculum in 3rd and 4th year , too , but it does n't go beyond individual words and a few nursery rhymes . 
  no grammar is taught before 5th year . 
   did anyone formally study a scandinavian language in either primary or secondary school ? 
  til about the fasces , thanks !, 
  in the austrian coat of arms hammer and sickle represent industry and agriculture . 
  they were introduced in 1919 , so i guess before they became the ultimate symbol of communist/soviet dictatorship . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_austria#symbolism ) and even though hammer and sickle now represent something `` bad '' here , the swastika is a whole different ballgame . 
  that may be due to our history , though . 
  i 'm not sure how exactly people feel in countries that suffered more from soviet than from nazi rule . 
  in austria it 's the * bundesadler * ( federal eagle ) from our [ coat of arms ] ( http://imgur.com/olhiupt ) . 
  some caricatures : austria spending too much [ money on retirees ] ( http://imgur.com/gpl9ihg ) austrians [ not exercising enough ] ( http://imgur.com/vhjlkpv ) here we apparently sucked in a [ ski jumping event ] ( http://imgur.com/7ulzgqu ) this one - somewhat ironically - shows a politician in 1980 promising to `` drain the swamp '' . 
  then the federal eagle [ enjoying a bath in said swamp in 2011 ] ( http://imgur.com/kxu7znl ) . 
  i guess some things are universal . 
  in austria most foreigners do learn the language ( to a degree ) . 
  however , i had one friend who worked for an american company in vienna for 3 years and * did n't * learn german . 
  he is definitely the exception , though , and he hung out mostly with other managers , younger and higher-educated people . 
  also , i think his company sorted out some things for him when he had problems with his apartment or legal issues . 
  so yes , in vienna it 's possible to live for a while and speak only english . 
  it 's a big city , gets lots of tourists , so many people in the service industry have a basic knowledge of english and you can get by . 
  if you wanted to study in vienna for a semester or two , you could definitely get by with english , assuming you mostly hang out with college students . 
   how would you rate their fluency ? 
  ime most foreigners or immigrants are pretty fluent , but it obviously varies by age , level of education and how large their community is here . 
  i know there are some older turkish people and particularly women who barely speak german , because they have their communities and the women often do n't work . 
  they will often use their kids as translators if they have to communicate with locals , like doctors or govt agencies . 
   can you in all cases figure out if a person is native-born or a foreigner just based on their fluency level ? 
  yes , in 99 % of cases people will keep some sort of noticeable accent forever . 
  one friend once surprised me though . 
  i had known him for months and then found out he was actually from former yugoslavia . 
  he came here at age 10 and completely learned german , including the local austrian dialect . 
  there is also a distinct immigrant accent now of people who were born and raised in austria but grew up in immigrant communities . 
  it 's similar to latinos in the us who sometimes still sound slightly latino even if they grew up in the states . 
   what sorts of mistakes do foreigners mostly make ? 
  mostly grammar mistakes . 
  german has some pretty complicated rules for clauses and declination , and many foreigners will get fluent by `` learning by doing '' to get by , but usually do n't get it 100 % right . 
  you are confusing a few things here . 
  1 ) the recent influx of people were refugees , not immigrants . 
  it 's a different legal concept . 
  if someone manages to step on austrian soil and say the word `` asyl '' ( asylum ) they are entitled to a hearing and a legal process that determines whether their claim is just . 
  ianal , but it usually requires for your life to be threatened in your home country ( e.g. 
  by political persecution ) . 
  you can also get refugee status if there 's a war in your country . 
  this is what happened in the last few years . 
  if refugee status is denied , you have to leave the country . 
  this has also happened and people have been sent back eg . 
  to afghanistan . 
  your refugee status can also expire when the situation in the country you were fleeing from is resolved . 
  2 ) if someone just decides they like austria and want to apply for residency , you can either be rich ( ie . 
  invest ~ $ 1m ) or have a job offer . 
  if you marry an austrian , you also get residency pretty easily . 
  all eu citizens can also come to live in austria , as they have a right to a residency permit . 
  3 ) becoming a citizen : i do n't know all the requirements , but they are roughly : * be a legal resident and have lived in austria for 6 years * speak german * have a job earning  $ 1.800 / month ( not sure about the exact number ; might be higher ) * not have a criminal record . 
  * pass a citizenship test ( about history , govt , laws , etc ) we do n't have birthright citizenship , so it 's possible for people to be 3rd generation residents of austria and still not be citizens . 
  it 's quite common , actually . 
  just to clarify , because the terms are similar in german : by `` countryman '' , do you mean `` statesman '' ( german : staatsmann ) ? 
  are you looking for politicians only , or any citizen of a country ? 
  compared to what i 've seen in berlin and hamburg , there is not much graffiti in vienna , and probably even less in smaller towns like salzburg and graz . 
  it 's been a long time since i 've been , but i remember denmark , sweden and switzerland to appear very `` clean and pretty '' . 
  however , i was a tourist in those countries and mostly saw the prettiest parts of town , so i ca n't be sure what it looks like in in other parts . 
  makes complete sense !, 
  he is so handsome . 
  almost like a god . 
  do * former * heads of government count ? 
  if yes , the answer can only be [ yulia tymoshenko ] ( http://bc03.rp-online.de/polopoly_fs/archiv-julia-timoschenko-bein-treffen-kabinett-1.2969043.1346064761!httpimage/70996582.jpg_gen/derivatives/d950x950/70996582.jpg ) ( ukraine ) . 
  1 ) colloquially , i think * amerika * is the most common . 
  2 ) more formally , like in the news , * usa * ( pronounced oo-ess-uh ) is most common . 
  3 ) formal and less common : * vereinigte staaten * ( german for ` united states ' ) . 
  4 ) formal and least common : * vereinigte staaten von amerika * , because it 's quite a mouth full . 
  yes . 
  i am not much of an expert in drama or acting , but this was the first time that i saw an actor 's performance and went `` wow '' during the film . 
  a ) pretty significant , but the craze about waltz and how much tarantino liked working with him was pretty obvious and known right after ig . 
  even during waltz 's oscar speech , you could see how much waltz thanked tarantino , and tarantino had praised waltz in countless interviews . 
  so i kind of expected them to work together a second time . 
  personally , i think waltz was good in django , but not * as * good as in ig ( may have been the role/script , too ) . 
  i think dicaprio should have gotten the oscar for django . 
  b ) i see django more as an american movie about american issues . 
  the fact that waltz is a german may actually be because they had to fit his accent into the story . 
  i also have n't heard germans being overly proud or even mentioning that fact that the german is the good guy in the movie . 
  personally , i think it could have been any immigrant or non-american . 
  after all , the us was the only country with slaves at that point , so an italian or frenchman would have been just as appalled by the treatment of slaves at the time . 
  ps : somewhat related . 
  i have seen a documentary a while ago , that the only people ever to keep their promises or rather stick to a signed contract with native-americans were german settlers . 
  whether tarantino wanted to reference that by making a german treat slaves well , i do n't know . 
  seems a bit far fetched , but it 's the only reason i can think of why germans would be portrayed as particularly honorable in the us . 
  my austrian perspective : 1 ) in austrian and german media , hitler and wwii is ubiquitous . 
  every other documentary is about wwii and the atrocities committed . 
  joking about wwii is pretty rare and has only really become more acceptable in the last decade or so . 
  i 'm not criticizing that , just explaining the situation to provide some context . 
  for me , personally , it was liberating because it dealt with wwii and hitler in a non-serious and almost grotesque way . 
  i also loved the fact that the jews get to take revenge on hitler . 
  also brat pitt : '' we 're gon na do one thang and one thang only : killing nazis ! '', 
  :d no austrian or german could * ever * ( or at least not for another 30 years ) mess with historical facts about wwii in such a way , so i 'm glad tarantino did it . 
  2 ) for austria the movie is significant , because christoph waltz rose to international fame overnight . 
  he 's a pretty big star here now and we 're super proud of the oscars he won ( of which at least the basterds-one was more than deserved ) . 
  3 ) i 'm a big fan of tarantino anyway , so there 's that . 
  4 ) the movie felt really `` european '' . 
  it 's set in europe , has quite a few german actors , it switches between english , german , french and italian , so it felt `` familiar '' in a way . 
  i know where you coming from , but op seems to be the exception . 
  except for that t_d comment , he seems cool .
