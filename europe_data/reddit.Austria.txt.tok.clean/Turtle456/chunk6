  it 's cool . 
  it 's just that we often get trolled here , and 9/10 times it 's people from t_d . 
   it 's rather more likely that this post here is just bait , so you can go back to t_d and crow about how deeply in denial we are tbf , he also posts in / r/wholesomememes , so let 's give him the benefit of the doubt . 
  that sub is full of the nicest people . 
  in burgenland some people say you ca n't hang up your clothes to dry on sundays . 
  i 'm not sure whether it 's a religious rule or a superstition associated with bad luck . 
  yeah , i 'm not a big fan of voting machines in general . 
  they add little benefit but create unnecessary room for manipulation/malfunction . 
  we do n't have them at all ; it 's all pen on paper . 
  and counting them is n't that big a deal either , if you have enough voting places . 
  in austria it 's the * verwaltungsreform * ( ~ administrative reform ) . 
  it refers to a redistribution of responsibilities between federal and state level . 
  in effect it would move a lot of responsibilities to the federal govt which are now with the states , thereby eliminating wasteful spending by not having 9 agencies ( the number of states ) where one agency would be perfectly sufficient . 
  afaik it would take the states to agree to losing power and a lot of tax money , so it 's * never * going to happen . 
  yet , in every election parties call for `` administrative reform '' . 
  there literally exists black-and-white footage of politicians talking about it in the 1960s . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  ... especially since the republicans have won elections * twice * in recent years despite losing the popular vote ( 2000 , 2016 ) . 
  yes , they were originally radio plays . 
  then came the books , then records ( vinyl ) , then the tv show and then the cassette tapes based on the tv show . 
  what 's our cia then ? 
  do we have a foreign intelligence service other than hna ? 
  honorary mention : [ pumuckl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pumuckl ) , although i think the tv-show and the audio-books are more popular than the actual books/stories . 
  in austria they are almost never mentioned . 
  i doubt many people even know their names ( hna , haa ) . 
  facebook is really popular in austria . 
  i 'm not using fb so i do n't know how easy it is to make friends there , but i think it 's your best option . 
  in austria it 's definitely vienna . 
  we had these people ( among others ) on our schilling-banknotes so i guess they would be on the list for euros .

  in my experience , it is n't bad at all . 
  usually , people bitch about the us the same way americans bitch about washington ( dc ) . 
  `` serving their self interest '' , `` do n't care about common man '' , etc. 
  during the iraq war/bush years people 's opinion of the us definitely worsened , but obama fixed most of that . 
  i 'm sure that trump will do some damage to eu-us relations , it 's hard to say yet how much ... 
  but generally , people like american things . 
  we watch all your movies and tv-shows , your celebrities are big stars over here and most people i know have visited or would love to visit the us at some point . 
  if you 're wondering how americans are treated when visiting : i 've never seen anyone treat americans badly . 
  i literally do n't know a single person irl who holds such a grudge against the us . 
  op , such opinions do exist in individuals , usually on the far-left or the far-right end of the political spectrum , but they are * in no way * representative of the general population that i know of . 
  alright , sounds fair , although i really was n't noticing a decline in quality recently . 
  i think it 's a great and very civilized sub , and the odd troll makes me laugh . 
   there 's a really reeeally salty guy on here who reports every post which has `` americanized '' grammar . 
  pack it in \u0ca0_\u0ca0 haha . 
  yeah , that guy sent me hate-pm 's a couple of times before . 
  yes , i 'm not a big fan of the voting system either , but we have something similar in the european parliament . 
  an mep from malta represents much fewer people than an mep from germany . 
  also , obama showed that it 's not impossible for a democrat to win , despite all the small red states . 
  no , i understand the american voting system . 
  but it does n't explain why hillary had a solid lead in literally every possible swing state , and on election day she lost them all . 
  well , the law apparently worked until 2011 . 
   the habsburg law [ ... ] was a law originally passed by the constitutional assembly of german austria , [ ... ] which legally dethroned the house of habsburg-lorraine as rulers of the country which had declared itself a republic on 12 november 1918 , exiled them and confiscated their property . 
  [ ... ]  the law has been found to violate human rights , and for this reason , austria was forced to repeal large parts of it , notably the ban on members of the habsburg family entering austria , before being admitted into the european union in the 1990s . 
  after a report by the organization for security and co-operation in europe ( osce ) criticized austria of denying members of the habsburg family running for president of the country , this provision was also withdrawn in june 2011 by the austrian parliament . 
  although the law still remains in force , it is considered largely obsolete , with the notable exception of the confiscation of the family 's property in force since 1938 . 
  source : [ wikipedia on the habsburg law ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habsburg_law ), 
  yeah , frustration is even too strong a word . 
  it was just something freedom-loving , rebellious european me had to get used to . 
  other than that i had an amazing time . 
  fair point , but in this election there were  10 contested states . 
  if democratic turnout in only a few of those had been higher , we would n't be in this epic mess right now . 
  also , it 's not just the presidential vote , but congress , too . 
  if at least one of the chambers were democratic , trump could n't do half the damage he is doing now . 
  ( yes , i know gerrymandering is a problem , too . ), 
   i also blame the half of americans who could n't be bothered to vote . 
  amen . 
  do you think a lot of democratic voters did n't go because they thought hillary would win anyway ` or did people genuinely not care ? 
  as long as so many americans ca n't be bothered to go vote * once every 2 or 4 years ( !!!, 
  ) * they have to live with the consequences . 
  honestly , what did you expect with trump as president * and * a republican congress ? 
  * ( sorry , i do feel sympathy with all hillary voters , but i 'm seriously pissed off at what 's going on in the us atm . 
  follow up question : is scots spelling standardized ? 
  i 've seen it written on a few occasions , namely on reddit and in irvine welsh books , and the spelling seems to be pretty consistent , e.g. 
  i 'm asking because when austrians write in their respective dialects , the spelling is never consistent as the dialects vary and the spelling is n't standardized , so everyone just spells it like it sounds to them . 
  is scots often written , other than for fun ? 
  in austria , no . 
  i think a `` monarchist party '' ran in a parliamentary election maybe 10 years ago , but they were more seen as a joke and got < 1 % of the vote . 
  i think the party still exist and they meet once a year in a restaurant ... also , members of the former royal family ( habsburg ) are still banned from running for political office in austria . 
  it was a measure taken after wwi when they were sent to exile to prevent them from reclaiming the throne . 
  if a habsburg wants to step on austrian soil , they have to sign a statement that they wo n't run for public office . 
  edit : apparently the law was recently abolished . 
  thanks , u/neuroskunk . 
  i was an exchange student at age 16 . 
  i was most surprised by how strict certain laws were regarding age . 
  can i get a beer ? 
  nope . 
  can i get cigarettes ? 
  nope . 
  can i at least enter the bar/club without drinking alcohol ? 
  nope . 
  can i watch this r-rated tarantino movie in the theater ? 
  nope . 
  my apologies to all trekkies then . 
  i know you take this stuff quite seriously . 
  the biggest problem is that everyone assumes i am super logical and rational , while in reality i 'm a fairly sensitive and fragile person . 
  * ( did i get that star trek reference right ? 
  i 'm not a big sci-fi expert . 
  ... and judging from your post history , you never will !, 
  since you 're going to amsterdam , the n\u00fcrburgring race track in germany might be an option . 
  afaik you can either drive it with your own car or be in the passenger seat with an experienced race car driver .
