  here 's their [ website ] ( http://www.nuerburgring.de/en.html ) . 
  i think it 's a great idea . 
  i would love to have a european tv channel , maybe a joint venture of all the public broadcasters , that shows european content exclusively . 
  it could definitely be extended to a streaming service or maybe a pay tv channel in the us . 
  i think the major obstacle to it is that all the national tv stations prefer to sell their content individually , as it makes them more money . 
  my little niece does n't watch tv yet , but i soooo hope she will like pumuckl and we can watch it together . 
  i 'm already downloading the episodes from yt . 
  * ( i had that one on cassette tape and i still know the whole episode by heart . 
  i do n't know much about podcasts , but the english media outlet of the german public broadcaster is [ dw ] ( http://www.dw.com ) . 
  check out the site . 
  it has news , videos , a `` radio '' link , and a link [ podcasts ] ( http://www.dw.com/en/media-center/podcasts/s-100977 ) . 
  i would n't be surprised if there were youtube channels of expats living in germany , but you 'd have to ask in r/de or r/germany for that . 
  you could also look at travel podcasts or videos . 
  they usually give you a good intro into a country 's culture . 
  the only one i know of is [ rick steves europe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/ricksteves ) . 
  i 'm sure r/travel could help you with europe-centered podcasts . 
   it is hard to believe that an event that almost shuts down the country ( 175 million unique views ) can be something people barely think about . 
  i can see that 's hard to believe from a us perspective , but until maybe 15 years ago , i think that was the case . 
  when i was a teen in the 90s the superbowl was n't broadcast here at all , let alone any other nfl games . 
  it 's still the case for the nba finals , nhl or the world series . 
  ( i can only speak for austrian and german tv . ), 
  here in europe we also have regional differences in the popularity of sports . 
  in austria , the whole country goes nuts during important ski races , while i doubt they even know about them in neighboring hungary . 
  american football has been growing in popularity in austria and germany in recent years . 
  austrian and german tv show 2 games every week - the 1pm and the 4pm est one . 
  the 8pm games would be 2am-6am here , so there 's no point in broadcasting them . 
  there are talks about bringing one game to berlin in the future , like the games in london and mexico city . 
  and yes , i watched the super bowl and it was pretty cool . 
  i 'm far from an nfl expert but i kinda like the patriots , so i was happy . 
   i could do without the halftime show and the glorification of the military but other than that it was fun . 
  the game itself is pretty cool , although the rules are so effing complex that i 'd be lost watching it without knowledgeable commentators . 
  the amount of commercial brakes is a problem , too , but in the european broadcasts they only show commercials in some of the breaks and go to the commentators during other breaks . 
  both the german and austrian commentator teams are pretty entertaining , so they make it watchable . 
  until 2 years ago , they showed reruns of * all * games the week after , and they cut out all commercials . 
  that was really cool but unfortunately they stopped it . 
  i think this is just a matter of time . 
  you switched to metric fairly recently and people just keep using in everyday life what they 've been used to . 
   do you often find or end up using imperial measurements in your daily life outside of the internet ? 
  no , not at all . 
   is your construction industry using standards like a 2x4 etc ? 
  i 'm not much of a builder , but i remember we have 5x8 ( centimeters ) and others . 
   can you purchase sae tools at a hardware store ( or where ever you may buy tools ? ), 
  yes and no . 
  it would be next to impossible to find tools for * only * sae , but some metric tools have sae on them too . 
  fun fact , the german word for folding rule is * zollstock * , literally inch stick . 
  the name dates back to when * zoll * ( inch ) were still used here . 
  a standard * zollstock * is 200 cm long , but it does show inches , too . 
   when you buy a phone or computer screen/tv screen is it labeled in inches or mm and do mice use the dpi standard ? 
  screens are measured in inches , but sometimes the adds will give you the size in cm , too . 
  waist sizes ( trousers ) and tire sizes ( cars , bikes ) are also given in inches ( afaik ) . 
   are your recipes in imperial or metric as standard ? 
  metric all the way . 
   do you buy food by the ounce/pound or is it always by the gram/kg ? 
  in austria , only metric . 
  i think in germany they sometimes use * pfund * ( pound ) when buying foodstuffs like meat . 
  i 'm pretty sure a * pfund * is exactly 500 grams , so a little different than an american pound . 
  ounces are used for gold prices here , so that 's international . 
  fluid ounces are completely unheard of here . 
   how do you `` eye ball '' or quick measure something ( aka what is your reference point ? ) . 
  what i mean by this is my foot happens to be 12 inches in length , so walking toe to heel , i can generally get a pretty accurate quick measurement of something . 
  also metric . 
  i have an idea of what 10 cm looks like and if i spread my thumb and pinkie it 's 25 cm . 
  * because the us is a close ally , both economically and militarily ( nato ) . 
  * in the iraq war , many european countries participated . 
  if we sanctioned the us over iraq , `` we '' would have to sanction uk , poland and others as well . 
  * russia took crimea and supported `` the rebels '' in east ukraine specifically to prevent ukraine from moving closer to the eu . 
  it was an act specifically targeted against europe . 
  * russia has repeatedly called nato a threat ( or an enemy ) . 
  since most of us are nato , we see them as an adversary rather than an ally . 
  also , it is n't just `` this sub '' that thinks so , but it seems to be the consensus among governments in europe , at least for the time being . 
  i do n't think the political discourse here is quite as hostile as in the us ( yet ) , but it has certainly become more divisive in recent years . 
  we just had presidential elections and instead of the centrist parties it was the green ( progressive ) and the right-wing populist candidate who made it to the final round . 
  the vote was almost evenly split ( 51 vs 49 ) in the first election . 
  we definitely have right-wing echo chambers mostly on facebook where the right-wing party is most successful . 
  there 's quite a bit of racism , xenophobia and conspiracy theories going on there and people bitch a lot about the elites , being `` victims of the system '' and `` muh freedom of opinion '' . 
  `` sjws '' are a little less militant ( or vocal ) here , but there is a derogatory term for leftists called `` gutmensch '' which pretty much translates to `` do gooder '' . 
  we also have rather extremist political groups called [ antifa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antifaschistische_aktion ) and black bloc ( left ) and [ identitarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/identitarian_movement ) ( right ) . 
  they sometimes have rallies and the two sides will clash in street fights . 
  luckily , both groups are pretty small so police can usually contain it . 
  feminists are much less `` radical '' here and race relations are n't really an issue , but it 's more about anti-immigration . 
  i should also say that universities here are much less politicized ( if at all ) than in the us , and if you are not interested in the social/political discourse , it 's very easy to stay away from it . 
  so tl , dr , yes , the divisiveness exists here too , although the issues/specifics and the intensity differ a little from the us . 
  damn , what a creative itinerary . 
   things to see : you 're passing by salzburg and dresden . 
  salzburg is famous for mozart-stuff and generally being pretty . 
  dresden has some incredible baroque architecture . 
  make sure you have at least 2 or 3 days for berlin , too . 
  i 'm pretty sure you can take a german rental car into ch , li and at . 
  dropping it off in berlin will be possible , but will cost you extra . 
  just check with the different rental companies , i guess . 
  no , it 's fine . 
  obviously , we 're not proud of him , but we do n't deny him either . 
  i think we 've come to terms with the past . 
  living : probably schwarzenegger . 
  dead : freud or mozart . 
  edit : i forgot ; it 's probably hitler . 
  yes , i think so . 
  if police have to assume you 're armed , they will shoot much faster in an escalation , simply to protect themselves . 
  well , shit happens everywhere but the major differences between austria and the us are * people are usually not armed , so police do n't expect people to be armed and the whole police < -  citizen interaction is more relaxed . 
  * afaik cops do n't have tasers here , so if an unarmed guy attacks police , they 'll usually wrestle him down .
