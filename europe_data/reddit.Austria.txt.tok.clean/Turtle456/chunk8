  ( referring to the first incident in the video . ), 
  * i do n't think all cop cars have dashboard cameras here , or at least they never release the videos to the public . 
  so when there are incidents like in the video , you 'd only * read * about them , e.g. 
  `` the driver was aggressive , but police managed to overpower him . '', 
  generally , cops very rarely die on the job here , and they also very rarely shoot people . 
  ps : a statistic i remember ( do n't have a source ) . 
  in 2014 , police in germany fired a total of 83 shots , 49 of which were warning shots . 
  pps : i 've never quite understood why people in the us so often seem to resist arrest . 
  like , what 's the point ? 
  it 's not like you 're going to convince the cop to let you go . 
  you 're only making it worse for yourself ... 
  yes , it 's a thing here too . 
  some people have `` please no advertising '' stickers on their mailboxes , but it usually gets ignored . 
   so how is it economically feasible to be sending people commercials that most often get thrown into the trash without reading . 
  the thing is , many people * do * read them and actually decide where to shop the next day/week based on the ads . 
  here they are mostly little catalogues ( 5-10 pages ) that show you whatever is on special at the moment in the various supermarket chains . 
  my mom , my sister , my grandma and many people i know browse them every day and will go to supermarket a if they see something they like . 
  they really work on many people . 
  also , i 'm assuming the advertisers have huge , long-term discount deals with the mail service providers , so i doubt it costs them that much . 
  a criminal organization passing itself off as a religion . 
  i 've seen a few documentaries about how they treat/brainwash/imprison their followers and how they attack their critics using their own intel service [ osa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/office_of_special_affairs ) there have been [ debates to ban them in germany ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientology_in_germany#initiative_to_ban_scientology ) but unfortunately it has n't happened yet . 
  this is pretty much how i feel , although i do lean towards considering them part of europe . 
  partly because of history , partly because i think a `` temporary political deviation '' ( even if it lasts for decades ) does n't just mean you are no longer european . 
  if we applied that logic , all of the warsaw pact countries would have had to be `` non-european '' between 1945 and 1989 . 
  personally , i think russia will come around to becoming more friendly with europe . 
  eventually , they 'll recognize that cooperation and openness is better than confrontation and isolation for their people and the development of their country . 
  in that case i 'd advise to take a few things off your list . 
  i think it 's too much for ~ 45 days , unless you travel really fast or fly a lot between places . 
  check out r/travel . 
  it 's great for itinerary advice and how much you can reasonably do in a given amount of time . 
  there 's a ~ ~ russian ~ ~ site called [ voat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voat ) . 
  i 've never visited it and have only heard that it 's popular with right wing extremists who want to avoid the hate speech laws in their respective countries . 
  ** edit : ** i was thinking of [ vkontakte ( vk ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vk_\\ ( social_networking \\ ) ) which is a russian social network . 
  yes , we know about it . 
  it was covered extensively in austrian and german media . 
  edit : it was even covered in the us a lot . 
  i remember watching cnn when the malaysian airplane was shot down , and they talked about the conflict for weeks . 
  i watch democracy now !, 
  every now and then and afaik there is nothing comparable in austria or germany . 
  in at and de the public broadcasters are by far the largest tv news source and they do a pretty good job . 
  they also report a lot on social issues so there just is n't as much room or demand for what you call independent media in those countries . 
  the international english language outlet of the german public broadcasters is [ dw ] ( http://www.dw.com ) if you want to check it out . 
  if i was american , i 'd worry much more about domestic issues he will be able to pass with a republican congress . 
  tax cut for the rich , repeal obamacare , increase the debt , etc. 
  : / i think it would be * really * important for democrats to take back congress in 2 years , just to limit the damage he can do . 
  until then , good luck to us all . 
  well , it 's definitely not in our interest but let 's wait a little what really becomes of this new found love . 
  there are still many forces in the legislature and the military ( and presumably the intelligence communities ) that see russia as a threat and europe as an ally . 
  personally , i 'm not too worried about all the `` withdrawing from nato '' - talk . 
  the us has taken 70 + years to build up their global dominance and i 'm sure they will not let a reality-tv-bully destroy that because he miraculously got elected . 
  in the end , i think he might lift the sanctions on russia but nato will remain intact and that 's what counts most . 
  in austria , teachers at high school level are not native speakers . 
  i only ever had one english class at university and the teacher was american , so possibly that 's common at a university level . 
  however , it 's definitely not the kind of demand for english teachers like e.g. 
  in asia . 
  ( a friend of mine taught english in south korea . ), 
  try asking in r/germany , too . 
  it 's full of expats and i 'm pretty sure i 've seen a few english teachers there . 
  in austria , i think it 's [ ischgl ] ( http://www.ischgl.com/en/events ) . 
  well , sleeping in your car might not be allowed , but you * can * do it . 
  just park next to the trucks that are staying overnight , and you would be fine . 
  however , it 's february so it would be too cold anyway . 
  plus you only have a 3-hour drive from salzburg to vienna , so stopping in between overnight does n't make too much sense . 
  i agree with the others and would recommend hostels in vienna and salzburg . 
  just google hostel + city . 
  prices should n't be too bad in feb. * warning : * you ca n't just park your car anywhere in vienna . 
  in many of the central districts you need a sticker which only locals can get . 
  your best way to do it is to find a `` park and ride '' - garage on the outskirts and then use public transport . 
  since you 're entering vienna from the west , [ this is your best park and ride garage ] ( http://www.bestinparking.at/garage/wien/deutschordenstrasse-3a ) edit : you * are * allowed to drive into the city , so you could also go to your hostel , drop off your stuff and then ask hostel staff where to best park your car . 
  as for places to stop : [ czesky krumlov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%8cesk%c3%bd_krumlov ) is between vienna and prague . 
  well , you could go to ibiza and see if getting drunk for 14 days straight will kill you . 
  there 's also a risk of stds if that 's the thrill you 're looking for . 
   but seriously , you could look at places in the alps . 
  i know there 's some canyoning and rafting in austria and i 'm sure you can do hang gliding as well . 
  i 'm sure you could also do that in switzerland or the french alps . 
  here are some pages about skiing in summer in austria . 
  [ link1 ] ( http://www.ski-austria.com/articles/summer.php ) , [ link2 ] ( http://www.bergfex.com/oesterreich/gletscher/ ), 
  hmh , i can only think of the [ tyrolean hound ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tyrolean_hound ) ( tiroler bracke ) as an austrian breed . 
  it 's a hunting dog and quite nice . 
  here 's a [ better picture ] ( http://www.101dogbreeds.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/tiroler-bracke-dog.jpg ) than the wikipedia one . 
  it 's usually a title for teachers who have an academic degree and i think you get it at a certain age or after teaching for x years . 
  an `` actual '' professor would be called `` univ.prof . 
  '' , short for universit\u00e4tsprofessor . 
  yes , magister and diplom-ingenieur absolutely get mentioned . 
  in the workplace or in formal situations people would call you `` herr/frau magister '' . 
  bachelor has been around for maybe 10 years and i 've never heard it mentioned anywhere . 
  the word does n't translate well into german and i do n't think it will ever catch on .

  it was later updated in [ this thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginarymaps/comments/4qsxwr/updated_cultural_geographical_regions_of_the_usa/ ) . 
   makes it easier for you guys to generalize all americans as being like said shitposter . 
  do n't worry about that too much . 
  we get a lot of quality questions from americans , too , so it all evens out . 
  plus , i think everyone on reddit is aware of trolls , so it would be silly to generalize . 
   some of these ignorant questions are comedy gold though yeah , i 've laughed a few times , especially when it 's clear from the beginning that they are trolling . 
  it gets most annoying when they are pretending to be genuine and wasting everyone 's time . 
  one of the users here has started to collect the best shitposts . 
  a some point there will be a `` best of '' - vote , so watch out for that . 
  haha , yes titles are somewhat important here although it 's getting less and less popular . 
  we have the following titles : 1 ) academic : like americans call someone with a phd `` doctor + name '' , we do that with lesser titles too .
