  we should give them some territory in europe . 
  just a small , fenced little plot . 
  then we start the process . 
  the sun will never set in the union !, 
  still , does n't count . 
  its impossible to be born lower than a 6/10 in france . 
  everybody knows that . 
  but imagine all the first class tequila we could use to make depression-faced-alcoholics-europe into fiesta-faced-alcoholics-europe . 
  i imagine the tequila would taste funny . 
  some mix between scotch and brennivin . 
  and a wall !, 
  just article 50 the fuck out of here , you twat . 
  i love this guy . 
  he 's like , the personification of the bad french tourist . 
  the only thing this is going to do is raise the number of `` unwanted '' children in lower income areas , while rich people are going to just go to another country to get it done . 
  far-right , far left . 
  same same , but different . 
  which would be why europe was able to colonize the entire world . 
  we had a lot of practice . 
  thanks based france . 
  3 beer = heavy drinking mkay then ... 
  poland can not into democracy . 
  its hot and stormy . 
  some basements are flooded like every year and you 're left wondering why those cheap fucks are n't investing in some renovations after having their shit flooded for the fifth time . 
  or why they still store anything down there that may be destructed by contact with water . 
  fp\u00d6 is having a bit of an internal crisis around the subject of an \u00d6xit ( austritt , whatever you wan na call it ) as papa strache tells hofer that the subject is n't off the table , while hofer tries to salvage his chances to become president by saying `` austria wo n't leave the eu '' . 
  otherwise ... well , we 're austria . 
  people from north of us drive through our country to get to the beaches . 
  some stay . 
  anyway , we make money by serving watered down white wine and tasty beer . 
  basically , the rabbi is just unwilling to let his religion bow to modern standards of human rights . 
  the catholics also stopped freakin drowing children and instead just let some ice-cold water flow over their heads . 
  religion dude ... what a hell of a drug . 
  `` our union will change , or it will die . '', 
  amen . 
  oh god , not again . 
  * the recognition as the archduchy in 1156 and the independence from bavaria * the habsburg monarchy as a whole * ww1 - when said monarchy bit the dust and the following years as the first republic and later the ostmark as ( willful ) part of germany , until * 1945 * and/or 1955 when the treaty for austria 's independence was signed , giving birth to the second republic . 
  * 1995 when we joined this merry band of nations . 
  people who seemingly have more of a plan than these guys : * grade schoolers when confronted with advanced algebra . 
  * someone new to gaming opening dota 2 for the first time . 
  * my grandmother when using the pc * a city dweller asked to make a campfire from scratch * me when asked to do my taxes feel free to add examples, 
  the worst is really that this became such a routine . 
  some asshole blows innocent people up , social media gets a lot of uploads of a nice little flag jpg of whatever country it happened in , some sights get the flag projected on and at the end of the day we 've become so numb to it all that next week , the rest of the world already forgot it ever happened . 
  i really want to care . 
  i really do . 
  but i 've become so numb to news like this that it does n't spark much of an reaction in me . 
  yea ... lets just wait . 
  their reign mostly ends in tears . 
  after a few days i do n't think cameron will be the only politician writing history as the biggest fuckup modern britain has ever seen . 
  johnson will be right there with him . 
  the icelanders on fire . 
  damn, 
  yeah ... on paper maybe . 
  i just read this [ comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4pks0a/uk_citizens_vote_to_leave_the_european_union/d4lwnxn ) . 
  i think it sheds a good light on decisions like these . 
  you want to be angry with them , but in the end , you ca n't really be too angry . 
  forgive them , for they know not what they do - i guess . 
  if they 're like `` hey ... we cool , right ? 
  no bad feelings ? '', 
  next month and come crawling back , i 'd welcome them with open arms . 
  they 're our brits , after all . 
  fucking idiotic wankers , but still ** our ** fucking idiotic wankers . 
  like a nation got drunk together and now collectively regret the stupid messages they wrote to their hated/loved on and off girl . 
  this guy ... 
  right now the uk should stay true to its word , fuck off in the 2 year time period and accept the consequences , including article 50 . 
  no more exceptions for you . 
  hofer and anschluss ftfy, 
  in scotland . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  the white players are the working and middle class people , the yellow player is the upper class . 
  this is the near future of the uk . 
  this is one of the biggest things in europe since the second ww . 
  yes , you can have an entire frontpage about this . 
  well , you have a few outcomes here . 
  scotland is basically all about its oil when it comes to economy . 
  selling that into the eu would certainly be a bit more comfortable in the free market . 
  then you have to think about the massive pull glasgow or edinburgh will have as big cities within the eu . 
  businesses and industry currently in london or manchester could be lured to scotland as they would n't loose much of their know-how . 
  its basically all up in the air now , but scotland does have some interesting options if they vote out of the uk and into the eu . 
  `` i 'm a politician and a populist to boot . 
  of course i do n't tell the truth , what the hell woman ?! '', 
  common sense was never a factor during this referendum , why should it be now ? 
  oh , fuck off wilders . 
  but they 're screwing it off in breathtaking speed . 
  `` europe , you do n't want us because we 've deteriorated into the worst islam has to offer short of saudi arabia and those other batshit crazy nations '' ftfy, 
  i ca n't really be mad about this . 
  good job , iceland . 
  you earned it you weird fermented fish eating vikings . 
  alaba sucked though . 
  not sure if it was his changed position or something else , but he really did n't do much . 
  yes , it seems like i have n't looked for updates for too long on the state of my neighbour nation . 
   reads question . 
   immediately thinks the one asking has been fed propaganda . 
  you may keep your uninformed judgement to yourself . 
  the truth is that since his election i have n't read much about orban . 
  all i gathered was that he was anti-eu , which is why i asked if i missed something , as this does n't really fit into the profile of someone against the union . 
  as you can see , i got some satisfying answers . 
  hmm . 
  wait , so viktor orban advertises for a nation to stay ** in ** the eu ? 
  did i miss something ?
