  okay ... 
  honestly , through the mumbling i was n't quite able to understand everything , but what i got was that scotland basically has to apply a set of legislative changes and then its good to go ? 
  or did i understand that wrong ? 
  i mean , seriously `` stra\u00dfbourg '' whoever you are , open your goddamn mouth when you speak , you sound like my grandpa on his eighth beer . 
  i think its completely fair that the scottish vote on this given the threshold they move towards . 
  stay with the uk , or stay with the eu ? 
  i honestly could n't say what the economically , socially and culturally best thing would be , but i can say that they definitely deserve another referendum with this historic decision in the picture . 
  if they vote to leave the uk , i 'll be the first to let them stay/back in/join the eu . 
  they 're a valuable part of the union , in every way , from their culture to their products ( especially their products . 
  i 'd be beyond pissed if my single malt gets taxes hammered onto it by brexit  : c ) . 
  the only thing i hope for is that the campaigns are based on facts . 
  both the stay and leave campaigns . 
  it would n't do to have another alternative facts fiesta like the brexit . 
  no taste and with that flair . 
  i expected better of you . 
  maybe . 
  that always depends on where you study , what projects you 're part of and if companies work with you on these projects . 
  definite answers will only come from the universities themselves . 
  no , i do n't think so . 
  at least not before master degree level . 
  but you have to learn how to make something fly before putting explosives in it , anyway . 
  most military research in europe is done by private companies , such as airbus or schiebel , to name a domestic company . 
  but if you 're really super into blowing people up with your rockets , then europe may not be the right address for you . 
  a lot of the technical universities ( technische universit\u00e4t / tu ) in germany have courses concerning aerodynamics , flight , spacetravel and all relevant subsystems . 
  home distilled schnaps is the best thing this side of the universe . 
  especially one made from the arolla pine cone . 
  no contest . 
  i just hope for you that this did n't kickstart the biggest recession in your post-war history . 
  which could happen , according to some estimates . 
  no matter how i personally feel about brexit , something that ranged from an initial feeling of betrayal to an eventual feeling of exasperated resignation , i do n't wish for people to suffer because some of them felt the need to get out of what they perceived as a bad deal . 
  well the nationalistic part of the argument is definitely nothing but `` muh empire '' and `` make britain great again '' , each as asinine as the other . 
  the rest i do get . 
  or rather , i get why people would want that . 
  immigration control , a freeing from eu bureaucracy and a freeing from some rather restricting eu directives . 
  problem is : brexit does n't just delete the eu . 
  britain still has to deal with the eu and by dealing with them they * still * have to adhere to eu policy for export . 
  is n't that why your prime minister is spreading wide so that trump 's usa can grab some pussy ? 
  they 're desperate for tradedeals now that the big tradeblock one is as good as gone . 
  i find it funny that britain wanted out , but you know ... not from the good stuff . 
  right now they seem like children trying to pick the meat out of the stew so they do n't have to eat the vegetables . 
  you 're either in and get the advantages , or you 're out and do n't get them . 
  simple . 
  also it shall never be forgotten just ** how quick ** the campaigners were about pulling back on pretty much all their promises . 
  i just ca n't take people serious who still stand on the side of ukip . 
  i mean , there is actual tangible evidence of what an awful bunch of unrepentant liars they are . 
  one nation who came together with 3 others to form kind of an ... abusive relationship type of thing . 
  i 'm fascinated with its history , and the achievements made during its ascension to become a powerful empire . 
  * however * , the current uk is one hell of a clusterfuck , circlejerking about what a great run in the past they all had while trying their level best to drive their nation into the ground . 
  brexit got voted for because of lies and misinformation , finding great breeding ground on astonishing ignorance . 
  if i 'm being honest , brexit has colored my view on the uk and especially england in a very bad way ( with the exception of the scots . 
  you go , scotland ! ) . 
  the fact that it got through not so much as the realization on what type of inane arguments , on what incredible shortsightedness it got through . 
  i get that the uk , and once again the english in particular , have n't felt comfortable in the eu for a long time . 
  but instead of trying to right the perceived wrongs , they kept swinging their nostalgia dicks around , made special demands and then had a giggle about some condescending joke they told each other about the union inside the house of commons , where nobody in the eu gave a flying fuck . 
  yes , there is some tension , but far less than in other countries , i find . 
  we have a relatively stable and prosperous social-democracy going in our country , which laid out a good foundation for a smoother transition from babyboomers to millenials . 
  the big bit of trouble is found in two matters . 
  one is the matter of policies and one is the matter of a willingness for progress ( which i think will always be an issue between younger and older generations ) . 
  the present austrian political landscape is very much gridlocked in `` present-management '' . 
  there is little to no foresight in their policy making . 
  there is no talk about how automatisation will crumbled the employment-market , there is little to no policy regarding the internet that is n't dictated by a fear of the unknown , ... because my parent 's generation could n't give a flying fuck or will rather remain blissfully ignorant of these matters . 
  education policy is halted in nitpicking , bureaucracy and healthcare-system policy is often spoken about but rarely acted upon and so on and so forth . 
  again , we do n't have that much problems . 
  but there are some that are very complex , but also matters that will hit every nation in the next 20 or so years . 
  [ novarock ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pika9ondyuu ) least amount of `` bro-culture '' , great to good lineups . 
  i never had a bad novarock . 
  expect to be drowned in beer . 
  [ frequency ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1kycv4fk4 ) some single packs of bros and other undesirables , but overall not too many of them . 
  colorful mix of music , with good to decent lineups . 
  impeccable organisation . 
  come early to get a good tent-spot . 
  [ electric love ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vauwk2hmp1a ) edm festival - do i need to say more ? 
  it 's not a tomorrowland , but if you like mainstream edm and the according culture surrounding it , there you go . 
  an surprisingly low amount of drugs , but so , *** so *** much alcohol . 
  its like you cross a bavarian bierzelt with a deep house party . 
  not my kind of festival and one time was enough , but i can see why people buy tickets for the next one the night after . 
  however , disclaimer , none of them are my personal favorites when it comes to festivals overall . 
  top spot on that list will always be reserved for the one and only [ summerbreeze ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhia7sbqdm4 ) . 
  well ... there are a few fp\u00d6 politicians who make a big deal about it to get some votes from people who have literally nothing but their faith in their life . 
  but its more pandering than true conviction . 
  the \u00d6vp is christian-conservative , so there you go , but they are a center/center-right party and very far removed from the zealot ways of the us christian-right . 
  being christian is kind of expected of these parties . 
  some also make according policy - no gay marriage , no adoption of children by same sex couples , ... , but none of them would even think about the insanity of teaching intelligent design and creationism in school . 
  given that we 're a catholic nation and the pope himself said that evolution was a thing , i also think the discussion about that is long over . 
  i live near the alps so my survival plan would be rather easy . 
  remain in my house . 
  gather food at the nearby pond/forest/mountain . 
  fortify my house against intruders . 
  thanks . 
  simple and to the point . 
  the horror !, 
  if i speak the language , i 'll use the language specific names for a country . 
  but i 'd just feel silly if i speak german and then just randomly add in the native name of a country . 
  not just silly , i 'd feel a bit pretentious and self-conscious that i slaughtered the word . 
  my spanish pronounciation is atrocious and my language skills non-existent , for example . 
  i 'm pretty sure that anyone from that country would prefer me saying `` spanien '' or `` spain '' before i butcher `` espa\u00f1a '' . 
  europe is as easily taken over by populism as any other nation . 
  we have issues we ca n't solve with easy solutions and some people latch onto figures who offer scapegoats . 
  as always , it seems , the us just does it all with a bit more flash and annihilates all limits . 
  trump is populism on steroids and cocaine .
