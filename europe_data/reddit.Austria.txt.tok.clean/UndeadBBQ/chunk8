  i never heard that version . 
  i did hear cia once . 
  j\u00f6rg haider was killed by leftist anarchists ( or insert whatever group they 're currently pissed off about ) in order to prevent him from becoming chancellor . 
  they just do n't like thinking that their favorite populist-fascist ended himself with too much schnaps and too much speed . 
  fluently - as in `` holding complex and complicated discussion over a long time '' there are n't many . 
  i 'd say about 20 % of under 40s , way less for older people . 
  the group of people that can have a nice chat with you in english is a fair bit larger . 
  basic stuff like directions , basic information and the like is very common . 
  the hike would still be a good 2 hours , but airline its about 500 meter from my place to germany . 
  i always cross this border when i hike . 
  `` cultural sphere '' i think the dach nations may count as one cultural sphere .

  do n't know if my personal experience is a good indicator , but yea ... 
  they 're not heroes . 
  hero is a charged word , and highly depends on perspective . 
  no iraqi or afghan could become a hero for me by fighting a war , simply because he does n't fight for me in any way . 
  i do believe that the fighters are heroes for some of their own people , just as some us americans think their soldiers are heroes . 
  the campaign , while certainly polemic , does have a point . 
  their cause is justified as they are fighting an invasion of foreign forces on their land . 
  occupation will always be met with opposition . 
  in general , yes . 
  but i do think that old people everywhere are conservative by nature . 
  unless there is a flood or other natural desasters . 
  then you 're absolutely , 100 % fucked . 
  i live in salzburg and vienna ( depending on where my work is ) . 
  but honestly , ist the same in both cities . 
  i 'd be there in a jiffy , but i heard there are a bazillion mosquitos flying around during summer . 
  that is a big no-go . 
  i think i got ptsd from an angry dutchman shouting at me for blocking the lane . 
  it was scarring . 
  without them my city would n't be what it is and we would not be able to basically dedicate an entire district to preservation and tourism . 
  the only types of tourists that are somewhat annoying are the middle eastern `` i pay you , you 're my bitch now '' types and the asian `` zerg-swarm '' types . 
  the first is really a weird thing to come in contact with . 
  i do n't know how common it is , but some of the middle eastern tourists ( especially saudis ) think that because they can throw a hundred bucks around like it ai n't nothing we austrians are to bow to their every wish and whim . 
  i especially enjoy when they are greeted with a bored look and a `` excuse me sir , but special treatment is out of stock . '', 
  the asians ... well ... 
  they 're really only annoying in traffic . 
  they do n't give a shit about what street or house entry they block when their guide is just telling them about some historic fact . 
  and god almighty help you should you dare to disrupt the swarm . 
  the passive aggressiveness may very well kill you . 
  yes , because i 've compared it with healthcare systems all around the world . 
  hence i 'm very happy . 
  going to the hospital and not having to worry about being broke afterwards is quite reassuring . 
  only if the job is * really * nice . 
  yes . 
  however it is n't quite clear how strong it is . 
  there are only very few who actively pray to the three bethen or wodan . 
  it is so unclear because most pagan gods/spirits / ... have been assimilated into the catholic mythology . 
  3 makes a pattern ? 
  tell hitler he ca n't draw . 
  recently ... hmmm . 
  well we fucked up the presidential vote 2 times . 
  food . 
  our food is heaven in the form of nutrients . 
  well ... at least a carnivores heaven . 
  the willingness to give a hitch-hiker a ride severely dropped with the refugee crisis lately . 
  chances are low that you meet the wrong type , but actually getting a car is really hard . 
  the 2d courses ( as far as i know ) are so selective that they normally also fall into that category . 
  i think they meant the [ `` yeehaa ` murica fuck yeah !, 
  '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb1b0tar-3s ) type . 
  highly depends on the arts degree , though . 
  if you paint or sculpt , then no , but if you successfully apply to an animation course , that 's another thing entirely . 
  its basically everything that was east of the iron curtain with the exception of eastern germany . 
  i mostly use the german names because i absolutely butcher the names in their native language . 
  alright-ish for a country of 8 millions . 
  we basically just hang onto the german scene and mix it with our own dialects . 
  probably the most important austrian crew , historically : texta . 
  two songs of theirs : [ sprachbarrieren ] ( https://youtu.be/4rxxdwikqys?t=22s ) and [ oba wie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po7nhqbtido ) we also have some well received exports with [ chakuza ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-ociyf8or4 ) and [ nazar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kapqd50nk7e ) , but all in all the popular branch of our rap scene is not big and migrates quite early in their carreers towards bigger producing hotspots such as hamburg or berlin . 
  then there is also the `` underground '' which has a fairly difficult standing . 
  underground often identifies with a life in ghettos and a certain gangster attitude . 
  both things that are practically non-existent in a country with a social security net like austria . 
  hence , a lot of underground rap is either satirical , funny and dealing with other issues , or so stupid in their message and delivery that you just ca n't take them seriously . 
  some just fun rapper of the first category would be the entire `` slangsta '' group . 
  [ die vamummtn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpj4mntw-go ) , [ moz ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irp2hw4s_b4 ) . 
  they do try to get some messages across sometimes , but like most of these groups , fail at the delivery of serious texts . 
  [ augustiner br\u00e4u ] ( http://www.bierkreiszeichen.at/images/bierpics/44/705.jpg?v=1344511021 ) , [ trumer m\u00e4rzen / pils ] ( http://www.biertest-online.de/grafik/gebindegross/trumer_maerzen.jpg ) in salzburg . 
  and you have n't really been to vienna without getting a k\u00e4sekrainer with a [ `` 16er blech '' aka . 
  canned ottakringer ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/eitrige_16er_blech.jpg ) at 5 in the morning , after a night out . 
  `` die oabeitscheichn kommunisten , do untn ' in da au ! '', 
  there is yoga that is merely physical exercise . 
  that one i completely support as its great exercise for students , and anyone really . 
  then there is yoga that has all that spiritual , new-age bullshit surrounding it . 
  that 's the one i think has no place on university campuses . 
  in your pubs i 'll only order jack daniels . 
  i really did n't want to bring out the underhanded weaponry , but you left me no choice . 
  well ... because you 're a fucking stranger , mate . 
  pah !, 
  we 'll send them to your cities to mess up every line by cutting in and they will stand on the left side of the escalators on the london tube . 
  they 'll also put the tea-bag in the cup * after * the water is in it and call all your biscuits `` cookies '' . 
  blood will be shed . 
  same same but different, 
  for the western austrians it would probably be the bierzelt . 
  you at least have to spend one night out in a bierzelt and get so drunk on beer that you feel the hangover for the next two days . 
  prost !, 
  imma tell the spaniards that they 'll have new jobs soon enough . 
  new spanish armada incoming . 
  ai n't nobody gets our bordeaux and absinth !, 
  i have to honestly say that i 'm too inexperienced in matters of military to give a concrete answer . 
  on the one side you need a military that can react in minutes to hours , depending on the size of the reaction you need to bring . 
  in some cases there is simply no time to waste with asking .
