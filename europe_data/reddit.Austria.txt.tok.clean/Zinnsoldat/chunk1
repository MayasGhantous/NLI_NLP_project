i would probably die when i want to visit my parents, 
  question : the scale of this map is not correct , right ? 
  what i mean is that the mountains appear way too high . 
  or am i wrong ? 
  i thought i would find something like `` serbien muss sterbien '' posters , but all i found was posters that ask citizens to buy war bonds . 
  lol .

  the green party had a vote about their list of candidates for the national council votes . 
  every candidate could apply for a certain position on the list . 
  a party member ( peter pilz ) who is famous for his anti corruption work applied for the 4th position on the list . 
  julian schmid , a young candidate where even inner party members do n't know what he stands for ( no joke ) , applied as well . 
  schmid won the vote with 55 % of the votes . 
  now pilz wo n't be in the national council after the election . 
  many people are angry now and asked pilz to found a new party and he ( probably ) will cost the greens a lot of votes . 
  edit : austria, 
  they think i am german . 
  i speak like arnold schwarzenegger when i speak english :(, 
  as i said , my source is mainly reddit and tv shows . 
  but people saying that they are an alcoholic and that they go to aa meetings and so on is something i 've never heard of in austria . 
  sure people say `` this guy is an alcoholic '' , but i 've never heard of anything like aa . 
  something else is the `` drinking in public '' thing . 
  if i would drink in public here , nobody would bat an eye . 
  since the legal drinking age is 16 , things seem to be much less strict for younger people here than in the us . 
  hard to tell , 
  went from vienna to japan with aeroflot with a stop in moscow . 
  payed 700 $ . 
  aeroflot was okay , a little bit `` russian '' ( no offense :p ) . 
  a friend went to japan with austrian , nonstop from vienna . 
  payed 800 . 
  austrian is basically a somewhat downgraded lufthansa . 
  i do n't know if those flights still exist . 
  basically they used the whole slipper stuff as an excuse , it would not matter if you went outside with slippers or with normal shoes . 
  had our 6th aniversary meeting last year , talked to a student if it was still the same . 
  he said yes . 
  oh yeah , i am an idiot  trusted my feeling on your flair without looking it up , 
  he is talking about actual thugs , not the police , 
  show was great , but i was always annoyed by the guests . 
  i am not sure but i think on april 1st there was a commercial for a new episode this year . 
  but maybe it was a dream , i ca n't remember . 
  oh no , it was a special show for frank elstner 's 75 . birthday : http://tv.orf.at/highlights/orf2/170408_top_die_wette_gilt100.html, 
  heidi not : it was aired 3-4 years after the original release in japan https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/heidi_ ( 1974 ) biene maja was a japanese-german coproduction . 
  kaiserm\u00fchlen blues is great . 
  do n't know how i could forget it . 
  a few weeks ago franzi 's actor `` jaywalked '' when i was driving on the br\u00fcnner stra\u00dfe in wien . 
  almost crashed into him . 
  bim bim !, 
  but they are japanese though :(, 
  we had a smoker yard in my high school . 
  but some day they decided that they wont allow it anymore and smoking was banned from the school 's property . 
  now you have to pay 5 $ if they catch you when you walk across the street with your slippers to smoke . 
  he is a great actor though !, 
  my parents watch `` t\u0159i o\u0159\u00ed\u0161ky pro popelku '' ( in german : drei haseln\u00fcsse f\u00fcr aschenbr\u00f6del ) every christmas . 
  do you know that film ? 
  haha , back in the 90s we ( my family ) did not know that this show was popular outside of austria . 
  we went on vaccation to spain , one evening we turned on our hotel 's tv and suddenly rex in spanish . 
  did not understand a single word , enjoyed it nevertheless . 
  i hate lindenstra\u00dfe , always had to watch it with my parents :(, 
  if yes : oh yes , i love it, 
  complaining using federalism wrong, 
  works both for me \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  just out of curiosity : why does it have to be hand-held ? 
  how about some good old [ bauern ] ( http://www.iss-oesterreichisch.at/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/%c3%b6sterreichische-krapfen.jpg ) - or [ faschingskrapfen ] ( http://images.ichkoche.at/data/image/variations/496x384/1/sacher-faschingskrapfen-carnival-doughnuts-img-2289.jpg ) ? 
  others may prefer the [ schaumspitz ] ( http://welkovic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/schaumspitz-prod.jpg ) to your schaumrolle ( me ) . 
  nusskrone king !, 
  we habe cabanossi here in austria , seems to be the same product . 
  1 person on reddit posts she likes doritos -  every european likes doritos , lol . 
  do n't know about any sterotypes but the one that we talk strange german . 
  and that we are grumpy , but i think this is more a stereotype within austria . 
  offensive ? 
  really ? 
  ( talking about the lederhosen and beer stuff ) it might be ignorant , but how is it offensive ? 
  [ bratl in der rein ] ( http://www.kochenundkueche.com/sites/kochenundkueche.com/files/imagecache/500x/imagefield/redaktionsrezepte/bratl_in_der_rein.jpg ), 
  i would say , they do because they do n't have any idea about german politics . 
  i know german politics enough to `` categorize '' the parties but i would not know her stance on most policies . 
  i think its an austria-hungary thing, 
  thats how they produce cakes industrially, 
  i think i 've never used it casually and only in school, 
  i called my mum for the recipe last week < 3, 
  from nowon it 's europe first !, 
  basically if everything in the recipe is listed in cups , he can grab a random cup . 
  deci is old greek for 1/10 and deka is old greek for 10 . 
  do you use `` decimeters '' ? 
  i guess not as you use inch and feet , right ? 
   decilitres yes , but 1 decilitre = 0,1 liter where as 10 grams = 1 dekagram . 
  i can not find any english resource about this . 
  i do n't think germany uses it either , but my mother 's cookbook only uses dekagrams for example and i grew up ordering ham , cheese and so in in dekagrams at the supermarket . 
  yes !, 
  i think the most ridiculous thing i 've seen was a cup of broccoli . 
  wtf . 
  in austria we messure in grams or dekagrams ( 1dag = 10g ), 
  yeah but your first post implies somewhat that only they ca n't do it or will do it :  can provide services that state either ca n't or simply wo n't . 
  it sounds like that either the state refuses to organize nursing homes or that they are incapable doing so . 
  either way i understand what you mean now . 
  yeah , but anybody could do that . 
  there are a lot of non profit organisations that are doing this without any religious background . 
  i mean it is good that religous organisations are doing this , but they are not the only ones capable of doing such services . 
  if there would no religous organisations , just some other organisation would do their job . 
  erm , here in austria most of this stuff is provided by the state or outsourced to said organisations . 
  for example i did my military replacement service at a nursing home by caritas . 
  but caritas was not dependent of donations or something like that .
