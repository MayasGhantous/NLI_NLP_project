  11 ) the reason the immigration megathread backfired was because many users thought that it sent out a bad message , that being `` from now on , we control what is said on this topic . '', 
  whilst i do not doubt that the intentions behind it were stellar , the megathread gave people a feeling of censorship and bias . 
  12 ) i would say that i get carried away by other people 's statements too easily and often start debates and arguments that i am aware are n't worth it and will affect no one . 
  so yes , i am a little bit short-tempered , but i am working on improving that . 
  13 ) 100 duck sized horses for sure , i could kick them away easily and they would n't be able to hurt my vital organs . 
  besides , what are they gon na do ? 
  please . 
  14 ) well , first off those are * four * words , not three . 
  did i pass the test ? 
  if this was n't a test , but a real question then my answer is * villain * , because i get a james bond villain vibe from someone * teaching * about their evil plan , in a ch\u00e2teaux in * europe * , whilst being protected by their loyal ( and sexy ) bodyguard * sexual name/pussy cat * . 
  thank you in advance . 
   he 's computer-illiterate it 's because he is n't aware that the 19th century is over . 
   pearl harbor is not the reason the us intervened in europe . 
  yes , it was . 
  any history book will tell you they declared war on germany because it was part of the axis . 
  and even if they would n't have declared war for those reasons , why did they wait 3 years , convienently after pearl harbor to attack germany ? 
  pearl harbour ? 
  the attacked japan and since japand and germany were allied , it automatically made them declare war on germany as well ? 
  did you sleep through history class at school ? 
  every 12 year old knows this shit . 
  the us only intervened once their country was being attacked , it 's literally the same case . 
  well , it 's a pretty shit value . 
  the fp\u00d6 stands for ** nothing ** except anti-immigration and eurosceptics , they have no economic agenda . 
  they are the ultimate reactionary party . 
  and you leave out how reagan ( as much as i despise him ) managed to economically cripple the soviet union by pioneering the star wars arms race ? 
  i mean no disrespect towards your country , but if you think you became independent because the soviet union was trembling in fear over what you might do if refused , you are very mistaken . 
  the only reason you are n't a smoldering pile of ash today is because gorbachev realized that attacking you would only restart tired tensions and that the end of the soviet union was near anyways . 
  you sound like a fascist , arresting people who being pro-immigration and nothig more . 
  that 's all we do here nowadays . 
   linking to / pol / remember when / r/europe was an actual debate forum ? 
  the fp\u00d6 might be the biggest party in austria according to polls , and that is fucking scary , but pretty much everyone who does n't vote them is rather pro-immigration , which is still the vast majority of people . 
  those hundred of thousands of migrants ( source please ) were mainly from the eu , and since migrating within the eu is bad according to mister rule britannia here , i suggest the uk shuts down there borders and the 5 million brits living in france , spain , italy , germany , etc , who are living off of a pension and do n't produce anything , be sent back as well . 
  actions have reactions . 
  the thing i hate about that quote is that the * exactly * same thing applies to capitalism . 
  why is greece in such a crisis ? 
  they ran out of other peoples money . 
  why was there a financial collapse in 2008 ? 
  the people ran out of the banks money and the housing bubble popped . 
  quoting thatcher is already stupid enough , but this quote in particular is really designed for people with zero self-reflectiln abilities . 
  this is a slippery slope fallacy . 
  serious question : do people in the baltic stations actually learn in school that the west paid no contributions to their independence ? 
  do they explain how the huge soviet union was intimidated by lithuania ? 
  i live one street away from a muslim area , too !, 
  they 're the only kids in all of vienna who still meet up and play sports at the park every single day , all the others seem to stay at home once school ends each day . 
  the fact that all if those dissolved decades ago kinda proves his point , when you consider that the npd and the nsu are still very active . 
  yes !, 
  it does sound a lot nicer !, 
  i agree that this new law is very bad , but come on . 
  holland was occupied during ww2 and suffered greatly through repression , torture and murder . 
  i personally think holland did a great job in organizing underground resistance movements and sabotaging nazi undertakings . 
  / u/footballissoccer , you 've made your point . 
  you can stop talking now . 
  it 's no longer funny or interesting . 
  yep , you 're 11 . 
  at least mentally . 
  wow , comments about dick length in a thread about immigration . 
  it feels like i 'm in middle school again . 
  but i was only talking about refugees ? 
  there is no reason to bring economic migrants into this because i did not mention them once before . 
  are you 11 years old ? 
  i fucking love bulgakov 's work !, 
  in terms of quality it 's definitely some of russia 's very best ( and that 's saying something ) . 
  it 's such a shame that stalin censored a lot of his work , imagine how much more we might have gotten if that power-hungry fanatic would just have let him work freely . 
  tbh those are mainly european migrants . 
  why did it change so fast ? 
  i hope you do n't take this the wrong way , but i think scientists have to discover a unity of measurement * so small * as to determine how much op cares about whether you like it or not . 
  i ca n't speak for all of austria , but in vienna at least , the biggest amount of support towards immigration has come from ordinary , mostly working class , people . 
  i see myself as very anti-american , but that guy had nothing to do with all of that and was making a serious and true statement . 
  judging him by his nationality is like judging him by his skin color . 
   but it 's not mass murder . 
  i wish i had an appropriate gif response for this , something like that one of obama where he 's just staring in disbelief . 
  but i do n't feel like wasting time for people who condone and demand mass murder against civilians . 
  crowd-applauding . gif ( and it should have been * n'est - ce * and * dont il \u00e9tait toujours * but you were so close ! ), 
  i guess this means that ** the war of the teenagers ** has begun . 
  and , this time , it 's * not * a phase !, 
  now that you say it , that is fucking weird . 
  luckily for vienna , we were blessed with extremely brilliant social democrat politicians in the interwar period who built some of the world 's best social housing , placed side by side expensive apartments . 
  it was planned in a way to avoid urban class separations and ghettos and it has worked marvelously to be honest . 
  sure , there are quarters that are poorer and quarters with more immigration , but we have nothing close to a ghetto whatsoever in vienna . 
  am viennese , can confirm . 
  this is n't actually a music video as much as collected security footage from a normal tuesday with our national anthem played over it . 
  no , we have this little thing called international refugee laws and whilst you may think they 're irrelevant , they matter a lot to us . 
  no , but it would send a message to other racists that this kind of mentality is acceptable . 
  i do n't want to get into this argument . 
  i seriously think this is a fun game , let 's play : czechoslovakia 1938 . 
  thanks for creeping through my comment history to find something i did , when ? 
  a year ago ? 
  8 months ? 
  that 's serious dedication . 
  i live in vienna , and see refugees all the time being brought in by bus across the border from hungary . 
  i think the biggest group are men aged 25-50 , but the majority of people are women and children . 
  at least that is the impression i got . 
  i 100 % agree with you on every single thing you said . 
  i was just pointing out that unlike the strange clich\u00e9s and lies circulating this subreddit , syria is not entirely a country of farmers and bazaar salesmen , but possesses a distinguished educated middle class . 
  `` obvious fact '', 
  you keep ignoring the topic . 
  you completely stopped mentioning the fact that you think syrian refugees are to blame for the syrian civil war . 
  and if you actually , truly , legitimately believe that , we have no reason to keep talking . 
  you do not want to learn or listen . 
  you only want to hate .
