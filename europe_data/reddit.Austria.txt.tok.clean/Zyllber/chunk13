  how many syrians do you know ? 
  zero ? 
  that guy who works at the bank ? 
  becauseyou sound like someone who has no idea who those people are . 
  whether or not it 's possible is irrelevant , because we were n't talking about that . 
  you are changing topics because the boat you call `` my reasoning '' is sinking . 
  and jus to sink this second boat , many syrians are extremely qualified . 
  syria boasts of good doctors , engineers and lawyers with experience . 
  but keep believing the / r/europe doctrine that all they can do is wash the windows of your bmw and sell you newspapers on the streetside . 
   leave their families behind no , they go to join their families to work jobs to make a living for them . 
  do you believe every single stereotype this subreddit tells you ? 
  are you actually comparing people who chose to leave a country on their own free will with people forced to fell or face misery , torture and death ? 
  what is wrong with you people . 
  greece and turkey are involved in a half a decade long civil war that has claimed over 100,000 lives and has given rise to one of the most barbaric armies since the second world war ? 
  wow , / r/europe sure teaches you something new everyday . 
  i would say assad started the war by having his soldiers shoot into crowds of people asking for democracy . 
  and are you one of those old-school nationalists who think that every individual citizen is responsible for the state of their country equally ? 
  most women and practically all children have no blame to take for the civil war whatsoever . 
  and even most men are n't necessarily fighting , but trying to survive in a dying land . 
  those actually part of militias are one thing , but some shop owner in aleppo defending his wares from looters is another entirely . 
  `` lol he 's japanese so let me remind him of the most shameful moments of his history '' is that so , abu ghraib ? 
  are you blaming refugees for starting the civil war ? 
  jesus , that 's a new low for this place . 
  if you were raised in syria , listening to its music , eating its food , walking its streets , travelling its deserts , making friends there , having family there , then that place will always have a place deep inside your heart . 
  but why am i even continuing ? 
  you clearly know nothing . 
  or worse , you know and chose to ignore . 
  yes , they really do . 
  i have spoken to many of them , they miss their country , their homes , their friends , their food , their music , their schools . 
  they really want to go back to the place they come from , and you can tell yourself something else as long as you want to , it just proves that you know nothing about what being a refugee is like . 
  do n't worry about him , school is beginning again soon and he 'll be too busy with homework to comment . 
  that they 're all lizard people from mars ? 
  linking some random comment from half a month ago proves what exactly ? 
  of course the first thing you connect muslims to is the fact that you got robbed by one of them once . 
  i 've been robbed by christians before , does it make any difference ? 
  no one steals any phones or wallets because of religious motivation . 
  i 'm partially defined by my hair color , too . 
  `` teenagers . '', 
  reading the article op linked , it 's clear this was done with a lot of care and practice ( hosting the flag in a certain manner so that it was very hard to get it back down again ) . 
  this is more likely to be an actual neo-nazi group then some teenagers . 
   the biggest flood of immigrants and refugees ever no ? 
   ** once the conflict ends ** if you would have read my comment to the end you would have realized how pointless your statement is . 
  you have clearly , *** clearly *** never spoken to a single refugee in your entire life . 
  they are tremendously sad about what has become of their home , and they yearn to return to it . 
  centrism is a political orientation , called that way because it balances out certain aspects of the left and the right . 
  it is irrelevant to what people vote . 
  do you understand what those terms even mean ? 
  `` tiny fraction ' it 's 40 % , the biggest group for this and last year . 
  and btw , what refugees come from the balkans ? 
  i was under the impression that the war was over . 
   but the refugees will stay there forever i know . 
  hence me saying refugees . 
  if gorbachev had wanted it , your country would now be a smoking pile of ash . 
  fortunately for you , he was n't as short-tempered and disconnected form reality as his predecessors were . 
  you know that refugees do n't necessarily stay forever ? 
  most of them want to get home to syria more than anything once the conflict ends . 
  do n't use the name of a socialist to push a right-wing agenda . 
  okay , link me sources of syrian refugees demanding sharia law . 
  please . 
  i guess bosnians and tatars are n't europeans then ? 
  no , far-right implies that it is far away from the centre , not the population . 
  the nazi party was very popular in the 30 's , does that make them less far-right as well ? 
  an autocractic and cruel dictatorship is shaken up by calls for democracy originating in the capital and responds by brutal force and using arms supplies by russia . 
  sound similar ? 
  no , they 're * based * in north africa , not from north africa . 
  you read the damn article . 
  okay , but you 've been independent for 25 years now ? 
  it 's been an entire generation since the soviet occupation ceased . 
  if it would come to open conflic with russia , you would lose every time , because even if you invest 100 % of taxes into military , guess what , russia still is stronger . 
  your only `` real '' hope is the eu , the nato , the un and peaceful diplomacy . 
  you are assuming that something ca n't be radical , yet the norm . 
  if they have far-right ideas , they are far-right . 
  that does n't change even if more people vote for them . 
  i do n't want to stress a very tired clich\u00e9 , but before hitler came to power , the nazi party often asked for referendums as well , mostly as an intimidation tactic . 
  yeah , fuck the sami , even though they 've been living there since thousands of years before sweden even existed !, 
  so war should always be number 1 in lithuania ? 
  eh , i 'll thank the 20 milion dead soviets before i thank you . 
  not with a white circle and a red backdrop , though . 
  that 's 100 % nazi . 
  i was n't being 10000000 % serious when i made that comment obviously . 
  please , post one single source of syrian refugees cutting off someone 's head upon arriving in europe and i will donate 50 $ to a charity of yor choice . 
  thanks for the correction , mate . 
  human rights = demented cult . 
  so we agree then . 
  we both have the same opinion . 
  the teachings of marx and engels , controversial as they may be , are still taught in every economics class in the world because they are so important to understanding the development of capitalism . 
  the fact that iran is still perceived as the `` axis of evil '' by most americans due to their anti-americanism says they are n't . 
  yeah , they 've got darker skin . 
  as opposed to those syrians , who are just going for a short vacation before returning to their paradise , right ? 
  seriously , syrians now have it a lot worse than hungary in ' 56 . 
  now do the uk and the us !, 
  by that logic , almost all countries in latin america and iran are completely entitled to their anti-american fear-mongering . 
  not even rt , if an independent russian film studio would make a show of that , everyone hear would call them brainwashed putinbots . 
  are you saying russia 's fear of nato is irrational ? 
  it 's not fucking censorship . 
  what they are doing is a hate crime , and it is in violation with our laws . 
  the people who actually live amongst refugees and immigrants do n't , because they know for a fact that those people are n't the `` spoooooky invaders '' the right-wingers said they were . 
  no , the people who are the most racist and anti-immigration in austria are those who live in the countryside , far away from any forms of diversity . 
  racist anti-refugee posts . 
  not anti-refugee posts , but ones about refugees that are racist .
