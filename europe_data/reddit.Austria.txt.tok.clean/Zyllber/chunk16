  his father works for the un . 
  planned and executed by another concerned citizen , i assume . 
  i 'm not even answering this shit . 
  i would try to look at it from your perspective , but i do n't think i can shove my head that far up my own ass . 
   those asylum seekers usually come *** through *** turkey going through a country implies coming from somewhere else , jackass . 
  syria and iraq both speak arabic , are ethnic arabs ( and partially kurds ) and lie in the middle east . 
  turkey speaks turkish , is ethnically turkish ( and partially kurdish ) , and lies in eurasia . 
  iran speaks persian/farsi , is ethnically persian and practices shia islam , as opposed to sunni islam , which is practiced as a majority virtually everywhere else . 
  afghanistan speaks pashto , is ethnically pashtun , tajik , uzbek and half a dozen more ethnicities . 
  it lies in asia . 
  somalia speaks somali , is ethnically somalian and lies in east africa . 
  what you are doing is taking random , unstable countries that have muslims in them and ignoring 1000 's of years of culture and tradition . 
  east germans had it way better in the ddr than syrians in current syria , and i am 100 % anyone who grew up in the ddr can confirm this for me . 
  ( not belittling the ddr 's horrific autocracy and it 's despicable crimes . ), 
  you 've probably never had an in-depth conversation with a syrian your entire life . 
   ** through ** turkey oh , i do n't know , the *** fucking syrian civil war *** . 
  we 'll get back to you on this one . 
   `` like pakistan ''  includes countries that have nothing to do with pakistan except religion, 
  european values . 
  south africa , nigeria and egypt off the top of my head . 
  there 's a huge difference between being anti-semitic and anti-israeli oppression . 
  war is syrian culture ? 
  wait a minute . 
  do you * actually * believe the nazis were socialist ? 
  fuck , i thought that kind of stupidity was satirical . 
  yup . 
  still refugees fleeing a horrible war . 
  those refugees from syria have exactly the same rights as those from yugoslavia . 
  no , they were n't . 
  the yugoslavian refugees did not harm our economy , even though the right-wingers said it would , did not harm our low crime rate , even though right-wingers said it would , and did not transform austria into a second world country , * even though right-wingers said it would . 
  * i 've seen all this shit before . 
  i remember when austrians wanted your countrymen out , too . 
   i condone it . 
  you condone the needless destruction of a potential home for refugees fleeing a bloody war ? 
  what is your fucking damage ? 
  yes , i think the left is to blame for right-wing terrorism . 
  wow . 
  communists in east germany actually promoted nudist beaches , often as a type of `` women 's liberation '' . 
  the majority of people disagree with me ? 
  must be rigged . 
  the poll , however , is completely legitimate . 
  same here . 
  lots of austrians incessantly rant about how awful the turkish immigrants are , but the majority of the ones i have worked with or attended school with have been polite , welcoming and hard-working . 
  yeah , fuck their rights !, 
  they should beg to me first !, 
  when did i ever mention the pkk ? 
  yes , tell me more about how the ypg is a fundamentalist islamic terorist group . 
  yeah , the will of the people of germany , even though the majority of germans vote for parties that are friendlier towards immigration ... 
  i do n't know , man , i 'm a communist myself , but stalinism really was a horrific ideology . 
  no comment . 
  why do n't you do , oh i do n't know , fucking anything ? 
  my friend is out there risking his life for human rights , and all you can do is hate on him from behind your keyboard for supporting and ethnicity you obviously have problems with . 
  he lived somewhere in eastern turkey for a while and became friends with lots of young kurdish people there . 
  when the ypg started fighting back against isis , he managed to secure a spot there thanks to his friends . 
  / u/dotdotslash _ bg linked a source below . 
  ( ca n't link , on mobile ) . 
  oh , i thought you were talking about soldiers . 
  he 's fighting against fucking isis , dude . 
  and the kazakhs , uzbeks , siberians , ukrainians , georgians , armenians , poles , manchurians , tatars , belorussians , etc. 
  it was the soviet union that won stalingrad , not russia . 
  it 's not really satirical anymore . 
  loads of people take that shit seriously . 
  i know a guy who joined the ypg a few months back , he was in my political circle , we 're all insanely proud of him . 
  and engelbert dollfus , the most forgettable one , too !, 
  those things happened 50 and 20 years ago , when the israeli government was far more moderate than today . 
  nowadays , they sterilize african refugees . 
  that 's not what i meant . 
  what i said was that the comment above me implied that socialism was nothing more than `` people who dont have stuff taking stuff from people who do have stuff '' . 
  shit i posted the wrong article , thanks for telling me !, 
  i 'll remove and replace this as soon as possible !, 
  no , you were saying they were n't `` your '' freedom fighters , which may be valid for you , but leaves out the fact that you have no connection to the kurds or the pkk and do n't live in a country that systematically abuses kurds . 
  obviously , the same rules extend to me . 
  she was taking driving lessons , and took a turn to fast , so i can legitimately believe ot was nothing more than an accodental tragedy . 
  the turkish state is just as guilty of terrorism , perhaps even more so , than the pkk . 
   communism fanboy i 'll keep my rant short . 
  i 'm a member of the international marxist tendency ( imt ) , an anti-stalinist international organization that boasts of members such as alan woods and malala yousafzai . 
  i 'm not trting to brag here or to show off my `` edgyness '' , but i have attended many political meetings , have read dozens of books by grant , eagleton , woods , marx , kropotkin , trotzky , engels , etc. 
  and i have been involved in many demonstrations in austria , mainly about immigration rights , women 's rights , and finally , kurdish independence . 
  i know literally none of what i have said will change your opinion in any way , i am just trying to clarify that my activism extends beyond the comment sectiok of / r/europe . 
  i really never understood this kind of reasoning . 
  are you implying that the 1 % produces more than the working class ? 
  marx explains that the only resource humans naturally have is the force of their labour , and they produce relative to the amount of force they use . 
  that 's why a miner produces , in terms of raw labour , far more than a rich landowner , yet both if them are n't payed accordingly . 
  it 's also not your country . 
  jordan has taken over a million refugees . 
  i think they have had enough for a while . 
  in comparison to the rest of germany , it is full of nazis . 
  are you gon na say he has a `` jew-nose '' and `` negroid lips '' whilst you 're at it ? 
   looks ( and acts ) like he has down ' syndrome lol crippling disabilities amirite, 
  i like to call what you 're doing right now `` my tragedies are better than your tragedies '' . 
  oh , that went right over my head :p, 
  uh , have you ever heard of `` lebensraum '' ? 
  slavs were supposeed to be genocided and the survivors where to be forever enslaved . 
  whoops !, 
  i thought you were talking about the people in occupied regions , sorry !, 
  and yes , as long as you were n't black , jewish , gay , or a roma/sinti , then germans definitely had it better than soviets under stalin . 
  that 's the question i ask myself , too . 
  the total and utter extermination of the slavic ethnicity is better than what the soviets did ? 
  so i guess the apartheid state was n't terroristic in nature then , right ? 
  it was only the evil mandela with his puny `` human rights '' and `` anti-racism '' bullshit .
