  oh , i can agree with that . 
  those weird pseudo-stalinists do n't know jack shit about marxist ideology and rather talk about the `` great achievements '' of the murderous soviet union . 
  you seem like the kind of guy who would call mandela a terrorist and ignore apartheid laws . 
  the majority of kurds definitely have warm feelings towards the pkk . 
  i remember talking to a 30-something year old kurdish woman from eastern turkey who said that in the 80 's , it was `` more common to call the pkk to solve crimes than the actual police , because the pkk was trusted far more by the population . '', 
  then look at how much damage turkey has caused to the kurdish people . 
  do n't forget the spooky left-wingers , who simultaneously are `` so weak they 're a joke '' and still to blame for every new law concerning racism !, 
  most definitely not . 
  the only time i was arguing in favor rather than against the soviet union was when lots of users from eastern european countries where talking about how the nazis were better than the soviets , to which i responded that if the nazis had won the war , those users would n't exist as an ethnicity anymore , since the nazis viewed slavs as sub-human . 
  of course the response i got was `` shill '' , `` fucking revisionist '' , `` go suck putins dick '' , etc. 
  as a left-winger , i am talking from personal experience . 
  i have been called a shill and a putinbot at least half a dozen times before . 
  like their skin color guys !!!, 
  get it !, 
  but i wo n't link a source , obviously . 
  nope , he did n't use `` reducing population '' , but '' ** depopulation ** '' , which implies he wants to reduce the amount of people in a nation . 
  so is putin , does n't mean i 'll ever take any of his talk seriously . 
  italians , romanians , germans and portugese cause the most foreign crime in switzerland . 
  those are all european countries . 
  all of you have never seen a swiss tabloid in your lives before . 
  the xenophobic shit they spew whenever a foreigner is arrested is horryfying . 
  oh god you have no idea . 
  no , he 's taking about the criminals being of a different skin color , even though other whites ( italians , portugese , romanians and germans ) cause the most foreign crime . 
  one thing i absolutely love/despise about what / r/europe has become is that when you accuse someone of being racist , you immediately get called a censor , a shill , a far-left extremist , an anti-democrat , etc. 
  however , when someone calls the more left-winged users literal `` putinbots '' , for something they have n't even done yet , it seems perfectly acceptable . 
  this place is too much . 
  kke might bit `` a bit of a joke '' for you , but like it or not , the party is getting close to 10 % voter support , which is not little . 
  i did n't even know it was possible for people to misinterpret stuff this badly . 
  the commentor i replied to literally called islam a * virus * , implying that only sick and diseased , or mentally ill people could ever follow it . 
  lol none of that is specific to islam in any way, 
  `` systematic murder '' is not genocide . 
  stop victimizing yourself by twisting my words . 
  * shakes fist angrily * des war a * deitscher * sag i !, 
  yeah , that marriage we bombarded and those children we assassinated totally helped the taliban get weaker , and not stronger due to rising anti-americanism and deep mistrust of the us army due to the repeated and almost systematic murder of innocent pakistanis !, 
  this just in : islam , religion that pioneered mathematics , arabesque art and modern astronomy declared parasite because a non-muslim destroyed parts of their holy book . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_union_ ( portugal )  ideologies : ** clerical fascism ** https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/falange_espa\u00f1ola_tradicionalista_y_de_las_jons  ideologies : ** fascism **, 
  i will always remember how he made viciously anti-semitic and racist statements back in the 80 's , and it took the party over 3 whole decades to kick him out . 
  * chuckles randly *, 
  you said `` there 's no post wwii fascist regime in western countries '' , which is just simply false . 
  you never mentioned when they rose to power , you simply stated that fascism after '45 did n't exist . 
  it was a mix of corporatism , ultra-nationalism , statism , religious conservatism and militarism . 
  if it was n't fascism , it was pretty damn close . 
  til that portugals fascist regime and spains fascist regime , which both existed well into the 1970 's , were n't real . 
  do you even have a shred of knowledge concerning history ? 
  i guess renewable energy does n't exist . 
  it 's either coal or nuclear energy , literally nothing else . 
  you summed it up perfectly . 
  lol are you from the 19th century ? 
  how do i refugees fleeing horrific human rights abuses ?? 
  not having his skin color , first and foremost . 
  this has got to be the single worst argument/commemt ever made on / r/europe . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nasjonal_samling a fascist party more or less was in power thanks to the german invasion . 
   they only did it once . 
  i did n't know albania , austria , france , spain , bulgaria , croatia , germany , hungary , greece , italy , lithuania , japan , norway , panama , portugal , romania , and san marino all had marged into one big , trans-continental country . 
  lol fuck them, 
   generalizes 1 billion peoples  gets pissed off because someones else generalizes is this satire ? 
  wow , we 've really sunken pretty deep if someone can just casually link to / r/european and get upvoted for it . 
  especially when you consider that turkey is a nato member and an ally of the u.s. 
  lmao you could make * exactly * the same point with christianity and the bible . 
  it does , but not for hungary . 
  yes , but has he achieved anything in that period ? 
  aside from convicing people to vote for him . 
  aside from the turkish government , yeah . 
  lmao, 
  wow , what you 're saying is legitimately horrifying . 
  just fuck over your own citizens until they starve , right ? 
  stepan banderas was a ukrainian fascist who collaborated with the nazis against the soviet union and carried out mass executions . 
  the more right-wing parties in ukraine still think quite highly of him . 
  pkk has had good reasons to fight turkey over the decades , it 's not like their fighting for no cause whatsoever . 
  pkk is a bigger enemy than isis ? 
  orban is an incompetent politician and a total asshole . 
  he makes public statements like `` dictatorships work better than democracies '' and constantly ignores eu law , yet still receives monetary support from brussels . 
  i remember a few months ago when everyone was aware of how stupid this guy is , but suddenly he starts whining about immigrants and everyone here loves him now . 
  what a load of bullshit ... 
  then i guess you must hate the u.s too , seeing how it took the slaughter of millions of native americans to become it 's own nation . 
  and you must hate all the balkan states , since they only gained independence through wwi . 
  and you must hate the pyramids , and the vatican , and the great wall of china , and every larger building ever buildt because it cost lots of lives . 
  history is blood . 
  communism is n't . 
  how am i not accepting it ? 
   and then you go on with `` but what about all the other crimes ? '', 
  you realize this argument started because you were talking about east german war crimes in a thread about rumanian ban on fascist symbols ? 
  the irony is strong . 
  the social democrats !, 
  no one once said that kind of stuff , not even the spooky * ess jay wees * that everyone is so scared about . 
  everyone condemned thos actions and those responsible got arrested and face trial . 
  * sourcessourcessources * and i 'm not denying that millions of people died under regimes ruled by communists , but there are also dozens of examples of democratic communist societies where no innocent people were slaughtered : ukraine free territories revolutionary catalonia israeli kibbutzim tuvan people 's republic zapatista-controlled chiapas etc. 
  and what about capitalism 's victims ? 
  what about all the preventable famines caused across the world due to capitalism ? 
  the toppling of stable democracies led by western nations ? 
  the ruining of our natural ecosystem and climate through staggering exploitation ? 
  if we 're talking about concentration camps in the historical sense , they have no connection to the atrocities of nazi camps , so your entire point of comparing the ddr to nazi germany is wrong anyway . 
  and those poor , poor `` political prisoners '' were nazi war criminals . 
  lmao i do n't belive for half a second that you 've read anything by those people . 
  generally , people who read about things tend to understand them better , which you clearly do n't . 
  what you 're spouting is / r/badhistory material . 
  so , it was n't a concentration camp , it was a pow camp , which every ally had and which is totally normal after a war . 
  and communism is not a murderous ideology . 
  if you 'd actually read marx and engels ( which i am 10000000000 % sure you have not ) , you would realize that communism is about reaching a stateless , classless society in which the means of productions are controlled by the working class majority . 
  and picasso was not a `` good human being '' .
