  gay = nazis , russia = gargarin . 
  juri gargarin was pro-europe , btw . 
  the far-right organisations had a ball on friday , mainly led by the ( grade-a idiots ) freedom party austria , which caused a massive uproar in left-wing vienna . 
  22 people were injured in riots ( 5 of them policemen ) and dozens of rioters were arrested . 
  europe is for everyone . 
  yeah because yugoslavia was far better off as a nazi colony . 
  i still ca n't get over the way the russians treated the polish during the soviet era . 
  an entire ideology , buildt on solidarity , fraternity and full equality and it ends with a pack of russians howling at a polishman . 
  and yet i see people here defending them , whilst accusing pakistanis of being the * real * economic migrants . 
  really , i 'm starting to believe it 's all about skin colour . 
  how can you be sympathetic towards balkan refugees today ? 
  20 years ago , they had legitimate reasons to be refugees , but now , the vast majority of them are nothing but economic migrants all of you constantly drone on about !, 
  source ? 
  all statistics i 've read place far-right terror way before all else . 
  what ? 
  aside from the raf , which died off decades ago , what left-extremism has there been in western europe ? 
  antifa ? 
  they 're not terrorists , only illiterate thugs . 
  of course that is their end goal . 
  but for the moment , they are well aware that iran is not ready for communism , and therefore mainly focus on women 's rights , workers rights , lgbt rights and secularism . 
  iran has a very strong secular marxist presence that dates back to the revolution in ' 79 , which was initially led by leftists but then hijacked by islamic fundamentalists ( it 's explained quite well in * persepolis * ) . 
  it 's a shame that the iranian government still systematically tortures and detains all communists , they are fighting for a secular , equal iran . 
  thanks . 
  that is completely different from the `` free trip home for illegals if they want it '' police op was talking about . 
  i was just generalizing . 
  ah , like every city . 
  source ? 
  * tips translation *, 
  uh , i do n't know about you , but the far-left raf has been dead for decades , whilst the neo-nazi nsu still commits attacks and even murders today . 
  they are a million times more dangerous and relevant . 
   stalk the streets of europe a.k.a. 
  work jobs , have lunch , take their kids to school , watch football games , etc. 
  the front page is literally riddled with immigration posts , and the top comments are all anti-immigration . 
  eh , most viennese muslims are turkish , but i see what you 're getting at . 
  yeah , it 's just ridiculously easier . 
  i remember what passing into the ddr was like in the 80 's , it was n't horrible or anything , but i rather just walk from one country to another and enjoy freedom of movement than be harassed by some soldier . 
  yup . 
  funny enough , the use of 88 as a nazi symbol was created by the american white supremacist david lane . 
  you 're right . 
  i hate how low the level of discourse is on this subreddit , and i admit i am well guilty as well . 
  lmao that one got me . 
  i 've been focusing on immigrants way too much in the past few months , i really need to relax . 
  yeah , that 's more accurate . 
  not that bad to be honest . 
  not really any proof , barely even an anecdote . 
  i live in vienna , which has over 300,000 muslims , and i ca n't say i 've ever seen a muslim woman with more than 4 kids , and even that was extremely rare . 
  most have 2 . 
  let 's be real : sd does n't give a shit about the `` homosex lobby '' . 
  they are not anti-immigration in order to protect homosexuals , they are against it because of their nationalistic agenda . 
  exactly , brown skin = muslim . 
  the reason i think it 's a nazi thing is because it * is * a nazi thing . 
  if it 's really your birth year , i profusely apologize . 
  however , i have argued with obvious fascists whose usernames included 88 more than once and have become weary of the number . 
  swedish democrats oppose adoption by same-sex couples , refer to lgbt organizations as `` the homosex lobby '' and have been heavily criticized by swedish pride for having organized a gay pride event in a muslim district , using homosexuals for political gain in order to set them against muslims and start violence . 
  they are not progressive . 
  lmao you have 88 at the end of your username , classic neonazi scum . 
  in what place in europe do muslim mothers have five kids on average ??? 
  even in gaza and bangladesh , the rates are lower . 
  i do n't believe you one second . 
  how about he supports , i do n't know , *** non-homophobic parties ? 
  *** you 're asking him to support right-wing nationalists , not because they support gay rights ( actually , they laugh at the idea of gay rights ) , but to further your anti-immigrant agenda . 
   humans do n't change between generations do you actually believe this ? 
  humans , * especially immigrants * , adapt drastically to their surroundings . 
  each generation is extremely different . 
  this whole article is literally taking a tragedy and using it for political gain . 
  the daily mail is a conservative tabloid , it 's a travesty they 're even posted here seriously . 
  it 's been a really long time since britain 's been on the right side of history concerning warfare . 
  i would n't be proud over what the uk did in iraq , to be honest , i 'd be rather ashamed . 
  yeah , shengen is horrible !, 
  wait , what ? 
  why should he be glad over restricted travel liberties ? 
  i 've seen sikh boys get shouted on in public transportation by old women many times in vienna . 
  just because there arent many sikhs here does n't mean it does n't happen . 
  stop acting like you anti-immigrants are an oppressed minority . 
  you dominate this sub . 
  `` but it could happen '' is an absolutely worthless argument . 
  did you even read the article you posted ? 
  it quite clearly states that around ** 57 % of germans are in favor of the current policies ** and alltogether ** 93 % of germans ** think that taking in people from unstable regions is a good thing . 
  holy fuck , read what you post and reap what you sow . 
  a source would be great . 
  are you seriously asking a gay man to support openly homophobic politicians because they `` only last an election cycle '' ? 
  what the fuck . 
  and btw , the term `` homos '' is quite offensive in english . 
  you are totally complaining . 
  what else is this supposed to be ? 
  that is 100 % up for interpretation . 
  you 're comparing tsipras to the biggest murderers of history because he won the elections . 
  how is that not whining ? 
   edit : why the downvotes ? 
  the only thing i love more than someone being compared to both hitler and stalin is someone acting surprised that people do n't share his whiny opinions . 
  to be honest those `` crazy people '' were hardline left-wingers , who are notorious for being very uncorrupt . 
  in case people are confused , a syriza-anel coalition is neither particularly socialist ( not since a few months , at least ) nor particularly nationalist , let alone national-socialist . 
  it ' h also used as a complimentary term akin of `` mon pote '' and `` mon mec '' . 
  source : friends with loads of marseillais . 
  if you think racaille is only capable of crime , that 's pretty elitist . 
  well , fp\u00d6-voting skinheads have attacked immigrants before and constantly harass people drunk at night . 
  of course , they 're not endorsed by the fp\u00d6 , but it 's clear where they get their ideas from . 
  then you have absolutely no right to call yourself european . 
  you 'd be surprised . 
  it 's the same in austria , young working-class outcasts normally vote fp\u00d6 , a far-right party with a decisively nazi history , out of protest .
