  they care about the rights of women in the workspace , the inclusion of women in popular culture without them being reduced to over-sexualized tropes and they want to reach a true level of equality between men and women . 
  because it 's completely unrelated to the truth in almost every way . 
  you 're right , i mixed them up with the independent greeks . 
  regardless , the anti-austerity sentiment definitely exists in greece . 
  as opposed to the populist right , who are always the first in admitting their problems , and would * never * blame their shortcomings on alienated communities , like immigrants , gypsies and homosexuals , right ? 
  if you add all the other anti-austerity parties together ( kke , pasok , etc. ), 
  you 're definitely over 50 % . 
  yeah , but he was still a muslim , which obviously proves to the people protected by him that they did n't need to be afraid of the average muslim . 
   the killing in the hyper casher store you mean the one were a muslim worker managed to protect everyone in the store , risking his life to save theirs ? 
  yeah , i 'm sure that helped with their hate towards muslims . 
  i doubt they would be considered centre-right in 1980 , mainly because they already existed and were already far-right back then . 
  ok . http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/france-fn-militants-burned-cars-fuel-insecurity-political-gain-1505631 members of the front national burned private cars in an attempt to creat fear and then blame it on immigration . 
  that sounds pretty fascist to me . 
  they 'll find a way to blame it on the muslims , trust me . 
  ah , so he 's not kicked out , and you saying he will be is nothing more than an assumption . 
  yeah , the all-powerful left , totally dominating europe ... even though almost every government in the eu is center-right ... 
  uh , jean-marie le pen was never kicked out of the fn ? 
  he 's a member of the european parliament ? 
  i always knew the greek communists were crazy , but i did n't know they were * that * crazy . 
  wow , almost 40 % of your country is delusional ? 
  you have nothing to lose but your common sense !, 
  you seriously do n't think le pen 's father , the founder of the fn , had fascistic tendencies ? 
   according to the iranian government , vincennes negligently shot down the civilian aircraft : the airliner was making iff squawks in mode iii ( not mode ii used by iranian military planes ) , ** a signal that identified it as a civilian craft ** . 
  well , the u.s. certainly achieved just that in the middle east , and , more specifically in iran : everyone hates them . 
  they did identify themselves , it 's in the first few paragraphs . 
  face it , there is really no excuse for this kind of behavior . 
  what do you mean intimidation is n't remotely useful ? 
  what do you think russia did when they shot down that flight last year ? 
  bullying smaller and weaker nations has always been on the agenda of superpowers like the u.k. , the soviet union , china , and the united states . 
  and once again , even if the grand u.s navy was thick enough to misinterpret obvious signals , they still do n't have any reason to shoot down an airplane ** on fucking iranian territory ** . 
  so it ca n't possibly be an act of intimidation towards a rival country ? 
  the airplane was in iranian waters , sending out signals affirming it was a civilian plane , how exactly did the army fuck that up so bad they actually thought it was a good idea to shoot it down ? 
  i think this was nothing more than bullying . 
  first of all , this happened in iranian waters , so the u.s. had no excuse to shoot it down no matter what . 
  secondly ,  according to the iranian government , vincennes negligently shot down the civilian aircraft : the airliner was making iff squawks in mode iii ( not mode ii used by iranian military planes ) , ** a signal that identified it as a civilian craft ** . 
  and  the 53 page pentagon report issued almost two months after the incident , while not directly stating the point , found that ** almost all of the immediate details given of the shooting-down were erroneous ** , yet absolved the officers and crew . 
  and finally , to top it off , the soldiers who shot down a civilian airliner , after it had established itself as peaceful , who killed over 207 civilians , 66 of them children , got fucking medals for their `` tours in combat zone '' . 
  no , i 'm not joking . 
   despite the mistakes made in the downing of the plane , the men of the vincennes were awarded combat action ribbons for completion of their tours in a combat zone . 
  what do we learn about the u.s. army here ? 
  kill 270 civilians on false pretences , without any evidence or direct cause , and you will be rewarded with medals of bravery . 
  ok , so where 's the riot this title mentions ? 
  it 's insane how someone can make the claim that an industrial planned extermination of an entire ethnicity was n't the worst thing in ww2 and still get upvoted for it . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655 how exactly was it an accident ? 
  it was an iranian commercial airline , flying over iranian territory in an iranian civilian airplane . 
  and they still have n't apologized to this day ( yes they payed some cash , but they never took responsibility for it ) . 
  but i was talking about an event that happened right outisde of iran , in which irani citizens died . 
  i said it reminded me of that event , not that it was similar . 
  but to answer your question , the us-backed iran was all about tyranny , yes ( not that today much better ) . 
  horrible and devastating . 
  this is one of those events where you can see what the soviet union under stalin was really about : tyranny . 
  it reminds me , however , of iran air flight 655 , when u.s. forces shot down an iranian plane carrying civilians , except that instead of murdering 9 people as was the case for kavela , over 270 civilians died . 
  edit : bush 's reaction to the tragedy is exceptionally charming :  the u.s. government issued notes of regret for the loss of human lives , but never apologized or acknowledged wrongdoing . 
  [ 14 ] george h. w. bush , the vice president of the united states at the time commented on the incident during a presidential campaign function ( 2 aug 1988 ) : ** `` i will never apologize for the united states -- i do n't care what the facts are ... 
  i 'm not an apologize-for-america kind of guy . 
  '' ** https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/iran_air_flight_655#aftermath, 
  lol the true barbarians of ww2 were the fucking wehrmacht and nazi germany . 
  and thinking otherwise is delusional, 
  did i ever say that ? 
  i was n't aware that people are born into the hell 's angels . 
  i 'm a marxist , yes . 
  but i 'm also strictly anti-authoritarian , anti-stalinist and anti-maoist . 
  okay , then the native american genocide . 
  does that come close ? 
  anyway , this is n't a transpacific dick-measuring contest . 
  secondly , lenin used the checka during a fucking civil war , and `` his population '' could mean dissidents , monarchist soldiers , western-backed insurgents , etc. 
  do you know what happens in war ? 
  people kill , or they get killed . 
  lenin did n't want to lose the war , so he made sure he could win . 
  was it a nice thing to do ? 
  fuck no . 
  but it worked . 
  so you 're saying you do n't give a shit about facts , right ? 
  it certainly helped . 
  ... which lenin heavily dissaproved of . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/lenin's_testament he evn asked for stalin to lose his positions within the government and the party . 
  here we go again . 
  is it so impossible to understand that whilst lenin did some questionable and even horrible things ( during a bloody civil war , no less ) , he also did some very modern , progressive things ? 
  what if every time someone mentions the u.s. , or , say , eisenhower , people would start talking about cointelpro or mk ultra ? 
  it 's always good when smaller , new parties gain power on local and municipal levels . 
  as scandinavia taught us , a diverse political spectrum makes for a healthy democracy . 
  in comparison to russia before , after , and today , certain things were simply more progressive under lenin . 
  i 'm sorry he ca n't be your personal lucifer every single time he is mentioned . 
  this should be the stickied post of / r/european . 
  eritrea is n't too charming , last time i checked . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eritrea#human_rights  in its 2014 press freedom index , reporters without borders ranked the media environment in eritrea at the very bottom of a list of 178 countries , just below totalitarian north korea . 
  lmao it 's even * worse * than north korea in certain things . 
  under lenin , russia was quite progressive . 
  women held extremely high positions in his government ( deputy minister of education , ambassador , general , etc. 
  ) , he legalized homosexuality and encouraged abortions . 
  of course , all that ended very quickly once stalin backstabbed his way to the top . 
  uh , what ? 
  austria and spain are both 1st world countries , i was referring to latin america , which is still developing . 
  but if you really want an answer , i would say better roads , more english-speakers , cheaper meals and more finished housing projects . 
  yeah , this is some serious bullshit , but let 's be honest , would putin ever publicly admit to his country being an authoritarian shithole ? 
  this post is completely useless , it does n't teach us anything new , it does n't surprise us in any way and it 's not really news , since the term implies something new happened . 
  and it also partially is n't whatsoever . 
  uh , israel had it 's fair share of left-wing leaders ( the legendary golda meir who grow up in a commune , for example ) . 
  but looking at latin america before the left gained power , all you can see is a bunch of cruel dictatorships , that disregarded human rights in favor of corporations and caused massive amounts of suffering , all backed and supported by the u.s. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_dictatorship_of_chile_ ( 1973 % e2 % 80 % 9390 ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brazilian_military_government http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fulgencio_batista https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rafael_trujillo https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_guatemalan_coup_d%27%c3%a9tat#aftermath https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutionary_government_junta_of_el_salvador https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/fran%c3%a7ois_duvalier https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/manuel_noriega https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_reorganization_process https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/somoza_family and that 's just latin america . 
  of course , people coming from developed nations are n't going to have the same luxuries when going to developing nations ( spain and latin america ) , but you can not at all blame left-wing politics for that .
