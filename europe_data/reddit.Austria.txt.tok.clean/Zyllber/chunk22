  that 's why i said  should ** go back ** to being a right-winged puppet, 
  wow , this is painfully stupid . 
  are you saying latin america should go back to being a right-wing american puppet , subjugated by cruel dictatorships and horrible working rights ? 
  fine , if `` sharia patrols '' are such a big deal , then i guess this must be , too : http://metro.co.uk/2015/01/20/far-right-group-britain-first-starts-christian-patrols-in-wake-of-charlie-hebdo-attacks-5028629/ http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/01/20/british-far-right-group-goes-on-christian-patrols-in-muslim-occupied-east-london/ http://www.eastlondonadvertiser.co.uk/news/far_right_christian_patrols_back_in_whitechapel_targeting_muslims_1_3925512 http://londonist.com/2015/01/far-right-group-targets-east-london-in-christian-patrols.php http://sputniknews.com/europe/20150120/1017141129.html these were people driving around in a fucking * armoured vehicle * , which is quite a lot more than some guys walking around . 
  but that 's not relevant , right ? 
  how many assaults happen each night ? 
  are they all relevant ? 
  no , but it does n't make it relevant either . 
  yes , and those so-called `` patrols '' are minor incidents that have happened less than half a dozen times . 
  there is more far-right `` vigilante '' violence , but that does n't seem like an issue to anyone . 
  even though slavery has been abolished in europe , you still owned him . 
  quoting , * word for word * , from the discussion you had :   are communists better than socialists ? 
  how about nazis ? 
   ** all are enemies if mankind . 
  ** communists are turbo-socialists , nazis are national socialists . 
  aside from the / r/badhistory , you were very clearly calling socialist the enemy of mankind . 
  you are denying this because it sounds fucking pathetically ignorant . 
  aw , so you run into the same 5 guys often ? 
  are you stuck in 2014 wuppertal in one specific district of town ? 
  if not , you have never met those people . 
  of course it made waves for the short , short time that it happened , but now , it 's become utterly irrelevant . 
  `` sharia patrols '' , you mean a bunch of 20-something year olds walking around on the street shouting some bullshit . 
  this has only happened a few times , and it is never mentioned outside of tabloids and reddit . 
  then you would have written `` socialist politicians are against mankind '' . 
  but you did n't . 
  you made a bad claim about something you clearly have no idea about and could n't handle the fact that some of the 20th century 's brightest members were evil socialists , out to destroy mankind . 
  hey , i remember you !, 
  you 're the guy who said that [ `` socialism is the enemy of mankind '' ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38e932/how_members_of_the_fp%c3%b6_greet_refugees_in_austria/cruknut ) and then got reeeeeaaaaal quiet when i told you that einstein , orwell , picasso , steinbeck , kafka , twain and more were socialists . 
  nice to see you have n't changed one bit . 
  wow , what an antisemite . 
  ah , so it 's not linked at all . 
  got it . 
  how is immigration linked to the breivik attacks ? 
  or maybe they were legitimately fucking devastated . 
  literally never heard of that ever . 
  it is practically universally agreed that the nazis set the reichstag on fire , as there is loads of evidence pointing towards it . 
  also , why would a communist ever burn down a parliament in which he had lots of power ? 
  this sounds more like right-winged propaganda than an actual fact . 
  yes , i 'm a marxist ( the anti-stalinist type , do n't worry ) . 
  i never said my ideology was `` holy '' , and believe me , having someone make it look bad is one of my smallest worries . 
  the horseshoe theory is nonsense . 
  it argues that extremes are always similar , yet the only similarity i can find is the use of violence as a tool . 
  aww , they totally should have called them `` karl mark '' . 
  ... which is complete nonsense . 
  juncker is a pretty funny guy ( * hello dictator !, 
  * ) but i find this to be exceedingly cruel . 
  greece is in a crisis situation , and he is not making it better . 
  this is despicable . 
  the breivik attack slaughtered loads of leftist students , young men and women with the future ahead of them . 
  when i heard the news , the leftist group i was with had a minute of silence . 
  the charle hebdo massacre killed leftist journalists . 
  the fn hated charlie hebdo for their left-wing stance and their anti-nationalism . 
  believe me , austrian nationalism is a fat pussycat compared to the neurotic ultra-patriotic lion that is mediterranean africa . 
  i 'm so fucking tired of that expression . 
  also , why not just say `` marxist '' ? 
  we 're talking about the fucking soviet union . 
  the worst thing about austria are without a doubt the austrians . 
  why would they have rolled into austria ? 
  we had good relations with the soviet union . 
  hey , same for me !, 
  i 'd defend vienna down to my last drop of blood , but austria ? 
  no , but we were talking about morocco . 
  george orwell wrote an interesting essay about british patriotism ( i forgot the name of it , i 'll see if i can find it later ) . 
  he basically said that because up to a certain point , brits were so used to being victorious and being practically untouchable on their island , they have developed the notion that they can not possibly be harmed and that war will always end well for them . 
  maybe that contributes . 
  i would n't say ultra-nationalist , poor , religiously conservative and uneducated are things we should look up to . 
  how can you know that for sure ? 
  austria had an agreement with the soviet union not to join any military alliances , why would nato have protected us ? 
   relying on the us to wiretap your own backyard ftfy . 
  austria was n't in nato , and we never got invaded by the soviet union . 
  do you understand sarcasm ? 
  i was literally quoting him about people not being worth anything . 
  also , my entire family on my father side aside from my great-grandfather were killed by nazis . 
  fuck you . 
  yeah , people fleeing abhorring amounts of violence in somalia and sudan do n't count as refugees , right ? 
  that would make us feel for them !, 
  then why already vote on it tomorrow ? 
  yes , but those trade deals are normally released to the public before they pass into legislation . 
  in ttip 's case , there 's already a vote on it tomorrow , and we do n't even know what it 's about !, 
  there 's really only one thing i can say about it . 
  if ttip is n't harmful to european citizens , and will only bring prosperity to our economies , and does not pose a risk to our well-being , then why the * fuck * are n't we allowed to see it ? 
  that 's all you 're going to say ? 
  you make a load of claims you ca n't back up and when i ask for sources ( which i * fucking provided * ) , you can only come up with snarky insults ? 
  yeah , they are n't `` worth anything '' , apparently . 
  edit : do i really need to add / s ? 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_english-speaking_population austria : 73 % of population . 
  romania : 31 % of population . 
   almost all romanians that * are worth something * speak english but we were n't talking about the rich . 
  we were talking about the `` educated working class '' op was talking about . 
  also , calling people `` worth something '' is a deplorable way of insulting the poor and the less wealthy . 
  sure , you make a great nato puppet and if it comes to conflict between your alliance and russia you 'll enjoy the privilege of being amongst the first to get bombed to pieces , no doubt . 
  your corruption antibodies are only so important because your government is so ridiculously corrupt . 
  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/corruption_perceptions_index you level of corruption is equal to angola and saudi arabia . 
  that 's nothing to be proud about . 
  you may be evolving faster and healthier each year , but , as you mentioned , you 're still generations away from being close to western europe . 
   we 've become the second most important eastern european nation * citations needed . 
  * i 've never heard anyone say that . 
  usually it 's countries like the baltic states that make the news more often , and i guess ukraine is pretty fucking important at the moment . 
  yes , you are stable , but aside from some countries like ukraine , georgia and moldova , so is literally every other country in europe . 
  this is not africa , set your standards higher .
