  my father comes from carinthia/k \u00e4rnten and fuck the fp\u00d6 for all the damage they have caused there . 
  it will take generations to get back all the money they gambled away . 
  how is the notion that no human being should be considered `` illegal '' disconnected from reality ? 
  it sounds like a really nice gesture to show people , who have fled war , oppression and misery that someone actually cares for them . 
  yeah , before that , allowing women to vote was communism . 
  and before that , banning children from factory work was communism , too . 
  times sure have changed . 
  savannajeff is a leftist ? 
  * how ? 
  * oh , right , you meant `` something i disagree with '' . 
  haha if the mods would have wanted me to fellate marx even more than i already do , they probably would have made me an member of the modding team like i applied to ironically . 
  well , * someone * was bound to be ... 
  false title . 
  his death is still unresolved , but doctors believe he overdosed on anti-depressants . 
  god i hate this pathetic propaganda war . 
  edit : thought he died . 
  incorrect . 
  point still stands . 
  and below , there are * filthy brown people * !, 
  they are marxists , which includes democratic socialists , communists , syndicalists , etc. 
  you judge an entire political party because one member once did something arguably bad ? 
  literally every major party in europe has their rotten apples , i do n't judge the entire cdu because one mp made slightly homophobic remarks once , and neither should you . 
  find me one source saying that revolutionary catalonia was anything but far-left . 
  i 'm curious , you 're asking for citizens of a specific ethnicity to be driven out of their homes and deported , how does that make you feel ? 
  * pure ? 
  find me one quote or reference by bakunin , the inventor of anarchism , to back that up . 
  but the entire political scope changed in catalonia . 
  that 's like saying that austria in 1933 was a dictatorship , because it would become a dictatorship in 1934 . 
  catalonia under anarcho-communists was a democracy . 
  stalin changed the system fundamentally . 
  i never said these things were good or bad , i 'm just saying they are n't autocratic , yet still radical . 
  the republicans were trotskyists , marxists , syndicalists , anarchists and communists . 
  see `` homage to catalonia '' by george orwell . 
  i specifically referred to the anarcho-communist years of prosperity in revolutionary catalonia , before stalin 's lackeys took over . 
  socialism and anarchism definitely advocate for a society without currency , as marx and bakunin bought saw money as a means to amassing profit without any tangible production , which leads to a class hierarchy . 
  marx especially was critical of money , as he said it dumbed down relations in society . 
  ** `` bourgeois relations - even maritial relations - have become nothing more than financial ties . 
  '' ** ( or something along those lines ) . 
  secondly , you are correct in stating that variants of marxism and anarchism see democracy as unecessary to achieving their goal , however , the initial doctrines of marx and bakunin once again insist on the importance of democracy , for they say that only through a freely emancipated working class can a true society without class be conceived . 
  ** `` freedom without socialism is privilege and injustice ; socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality . 
  good think we have a bunch of junckers ready to slap them once that happens . 
  that i can agree on . 
  it 's always good to be wrong together . 
  revolutionary catalonia . 
  ukrainian free territories . 
  zapatista-controlled chiapas . 
  red corridor in india . 
  those are some far-left communities , past and present , that have not relied on autocracy , tyranny or being a dictatorship to promote their ideas and build their visions of a classless society . 
  it 's not a question of practice , it 's a question of cherry picking answers . 
  how did revolutionary catalonia , an anarcho-communist society , enforce a dictatorship ? 
  how did the ukrainian free territories ? 
  you clearly have no idea what you 're talking about . 
  but they 're not fundamentally similar . 
  socialism , anarchism and communism are stateless , classless , moneyless socieities in which democratic councils lead communities and the means of production are equally distributed . 
  fascim is a ultra-nationalist society in which the state rules over its citizens and has an autocratic authority over indoctrination , creed , and class hierarchy . 
  these ideologies are fundamentally opposed , whether your agenda likes it or not . 
  the horseshoe theory can be disproved through numerous examples ( the spanish civil war , for one ) and the ideologies themselves are very different to begin with . 
  that 's an old , * old * saying that goes back to the second french empire . 
  it 's is now predominantly used to dismiss left-wing ideas , but , if i recall correctly , it was created in order to be anti-monarchist ( something like young and anti-monarchist = no heart , old and pro-monarchist = no brain ) . 
  no , i understodd the 9/11 truther reference . 
  it just does n't really add up if you use `` melt '' . 
  should n't it be `` ca n't * smash * byzantine walls '' ? 
  he 's definitely a great composer , no doubt , but he 's not classical by any means . 
  leftist here , i 'm not too fluent on the spanish political landscape , but are there any right-oriented parties except the pp ? 
  the ruling conservative party has done far more damage than good , and i wonder if there are any alternative for more conservative voters . 
  this is a big step forward for spain . 
  too long have the mainstream parties ruled amidst corruption and austerity . 
  yes , because the tzar was the personification of innocence and democracy , right ? 
  neither was churchill . 
  he was still a million times better than stalin ever was . 
  trotsky . 
  * where are you sticking that finger , varoufakis ? 
  `` german '' in the 18th century does n't mean what it means now . 
  today , it means being part of the republic of germany , back then , it meant being german ethnically . 
  hitler called himself german , yet he was born in austria . 
  mozart worked and lived in vienna at the imperial court , where he comnposed for the austrian emperor . 
  he is literally not german in any way other than ethnically . 
  his music was made for the austrian empire , and our anthem was even composed by him , for this country . 
  you say that because sissi was born in the holy roman empire , she was automatically german ? 
  so i guess people born in venice , rome , prague , zurich and lyon are all german as well , seeing how these cities were all part of the holy roman empire at one point in history . 
  bavaria is traditionally closer to austria then most parts of germany ( not so much anymore , but definitely at the 18th century ) . 
  saying sissi , empress of austria , was more `` german than anything else '' is badhistory ^ tm . 
   how about we grow the fuck up ... right after you make a joke discreting austrian heritage . 
  do you realise the hipocrisy in that statement ? 
  ** you made a comment ending with `` xd '' ** and you 're asking * me * to be mature ? 
   i am so fucking sick and tired of people who themselves are ready to make stupid jokes about everything , yet when it comes to a topic ( they apparently even do n't know much about ) they do n't like , they get angry ... 
  this literally applies to you . 
  you made a stupid joke about something you apparently have little to no clue about , and then told me to `` grow the fuck up '' when i confronted you about it . 
  mozart was an austrian . 
  hitler was an austrian . 
  i am a proud citizen of this tiny , unimportant , land-locked nation . 
  i wil admit my mistakes , but i will * not * have my heritage belittled . 
  true , most of them are from the balkans , but a massive portion is from turkey , chechnya , syria , iran , etc. 
  dude , you are such an arrogant , uninformed snob .

  inform yourself , and this time , find sources outside of stormfront . 
  like , vienna , which is almost 40 % non-austrian and was rated one of the worlds most liveable cities ... 
  this must be quite rare , if it does . 
  i went to an austrian public school for two years in which around roughly half the students were muslim , and not a single time did their religion influence the classroom .
