  '' ** '' ** as fuehrer of the german people ** and chancellor of the reich , i can thank god at this moment that he has so wonderfully blessed us in our hard struggle for what is our right , and beg him that we and all other nations may find the right way , so that not only the german people but all europe may once more be granted the blessing of peace . '', 
  `` since january , 1933 , when providence entrusted me with the ** leadership of the german reich ** , i had an aim before my eyes which was essentially incorporated in the program of our national socialist party . 
  i have never been disloyal to this aim and have never abandoned my program ... only when ** the entire german people ** become a single community of sacrifice can we expect and hope that almighty god will help us . '', 
  `` our enemies must not deceive themselves -- in the 2,000 years of ** german history ** known to us , our people have never been more united than today . 
  the lord of the universe has treated us so well in the past years that we bow in gratitude to a providence which has allowed us to be members of such a ** great nation ** . we thank him that we also can be entered with honor into the ever-lasting book of ** german history ** ! '', 
  `` i may be permitted to say that in that winter the ** german people ** , and in particular its wehrmacht , were weighed in the balance by providence . 
  nothing worse can or will happen . 
  that we conquered that winter , that `` general winter , '' that at last the ** german fronts ** stood , and that this spring , that is , early this summer , we were able to proceed again , that , i believe , is the proof that providence was content with the ** german people ** ... '' i 'm digging through all his quotes but i can barely find anything mentioning an `` aryan empire '' . 
  all i get is germany , germany , germany . 
  almost as adolf hitler was a german , which , according to you , he is `` literally not '' . 
  yes , but they * won the war * . 
  / u/zwarty here claims that it was a `` defeat which they paid dearly '' , which is total bullshit . 
  you know that russia won that war , right ? 
  nationality is most definitely influenced by the parents nationality , it 's kinda how culture develops . 
  and what do you mean hitler did n't see his `` empire '' as german ? 
  he literally called it the `` german reich '' and not the `` aryan reich '' !, 
  if it had only included germany , then i guess that whole thing about `` german blood '' and the fact that he started almost all his speaches by adressing the german people were kinda hypocritical , right ? 
  you 're right about the russian part , i do n't disagree with you there , but saying that hitler was n't remotely german is so fucking ignorant . 
  they seem totally fine . 
  no mention of pronouns , or sexual identification or any white guilt stuff , just a feminist left-wing party promoting feminism . 
  except that hitler had a german family , with a father in the german military and rejected his austrian nationality . 
  stalin never saw himself as russian , but as a soviet , whereas hitler saw himself as a german in every possible way . 
  german family , spoke german , fought on the german side in wwi , had a german accent , lived a few meters away from germany in his youth , eventually became a full german citizen . 
  he 's definitely a lot more german than stalin was russian , that 's for sure . 
  why do we need constant reminding of this ? 
  i swear , it 's like the fourth time something like this is posted this month . 
  we get it , stalin was a horrible leader and the soviet union was a terror state , where 's the news ? 
  well , he was born in braunau , austria . 
  i 've been there , it 's literally half a minute 's walk away from germany , so i guess he 's austrian legally , but german culturally and ethnically . 
  i hate people using sjw as a buzz-word for `` lefties i do n't like '' . 
  it 's just as stupid as the left using fascist as a buzz-word for `` right-wingers i do n't like '' . 
  eh , those things are kinda dumb , i guess , but it 's not like they have any realistic chance at doing most of those things , even if they were in the government . 
  for me , i really think that the greens are a reliable party that should definitely have a voice in british politics . 
  a religious caliphate is still a nation , just one buildt on islamic theocratic principles . 
  and the reason you can get killed for waving an iraqi flag is due to their nationalism and because they are at war with iraq . 
  ( what kind of an argument is that anyway ? 
  they ca n't be nationalist because they 're hostile towards an enemy nation ? ), 
  homophobia , anti-women 's rights and racism have always been on the far-right spectrum , that is undeniable . 
  this does n't mean that everyone right-winger necessarily believes in those things , but you 'll never find an anti-feminist or a homophobe on the left ( the exception being bullshit like stalinism ) . 
  how exactly is religious extremism not right-winged ? 
  it demands a union between church and state ( right ) and is anti-progressive ( far-right ) . 
  anti-women 's rights , homophobic , racist ( they want to exterminate the yehzidi minority ) , staunchly anti-marxist , ultra-nationalist ... 
   russia in 2015  communist  top kek, 
  yeah , they are pretty pathetic . 
  i 'm a hardline leftist and antifa is considered the class clown of the left in most groups i 've been in . 
  i 'm sorry , but the countries that suffered the most from fascism are also ukraine and russia , countries that both support certain fascist groups in some way or other . 
  i always thought * cit\u00e9 des enfants perdus * captured the spirit of industrial france , albeit in a surrealist way . 
  a friend of my fathers played in hundstage , so great to see it mentioned here !, 
  very fun movie , although quite a cringe-fest !, 
  left-winger here , can confirm . 
  would definitely work with isis , even though there are marxist kurds battling them right now and they 're a far-right ultra-conservative terrorist group . 
  but yes , the world is black and white , / u/fodtp , and whoever is n't with me is against me . 
  / u/unidan, 
  really , the only chances for more women 's rights in turkey come from left-wing parties , so it 's not that much of a mystery that parties like the communists and the pkk are almost 50 % women . 
  she is against gay marriage and against gay couples having the right to adopt . 
  how is that not homophobic ? 
  also , she precisely gave statements concerning the culpability of dreyfus , even though it 's pretty fucking irrelevant today . 
  how can you like her ? 
  she 's not as bad as her father , but she 's still a lying , racist , homophobic , arrogant anti-dreyfussard who could wreck the eu would she come to power . 
  very interesting man with a fascinating life , here 's a quick recap : born around the turn of the century , tito grew up in the outskirts of vienna in the last years of the austro-hungarian empire , working in factories and the like . 
  when the first world war broke out , tito was sent to fight russia in the eastern front , where he was captured and sent to prison , only to be eventually liberated by the bolshevik forces . 
  he became a communist and engaged in the newly-formed ussr for several years , learning russian . 
  he also fought in the spanish civil war , founded the communist party of yugoslavia , which orchestrated the partisan movement within nazi occupation and totally crushed the occupiers with only little outside help . 
  tito , now the leader of socialist yugoslavia , enjoyed a massive worldwide popularity from both west and east . 
  he refused to become a member of the warsaw pact and started the non-alignment movement . 
  it is only unfortunate that tito was so important to keeping yugoslavia afloat , as all hell broke loose once he died . 
  still , a fascinating man . 
  guess why . 
  theyre not actually building a mosque on the spot where the towers once stood , and it 's definitely not meant as an insult in any way . 
  and just because an event is linked to islam does n't mean that all muslims are forever guilty . 
  by that logic , christians should n't be aloud to build churches anywhere in latin america , due to catholic soldiers slaughtering tens of thousands in the name of god there . 
  why , because a religion of 1 billion prople is n't allowed to pray in their temples due to an event that affected them way more than any other religious group ? 
  yeah , i have the same question . 
  of course these things are extremely awful and must be crushing for the family of the deceased , but is this really relevant ? 
  i mean , if i would post an article here every time a monument in vienna is vandalized ... 
  it 's not about that . 
  someone asked for context , you gave him an extremely biased report , and then said that the only reason you did n't meantion why they were protesting was due to them destroying property . 
  since you did n't mention * why * they were protesting , it could have been anything , hence me comparing it to tiannamen square . 
  so i guess the tiannamen square protesters were all `` cunts '' as well , seeing how they destroyed cars and bicycles , right ? 
  nope , i never said anything close to that . 
  i will correct myself , you were definitely right in saying that they happen frequently , but those events still remain rather minor , seeing how the 1st of may is celebrated since the 1890 's . 
  also , the maikrawalle you linked mostly talked about tiny things like firecrackers , or went in the opposite direction and mentioned right-wing disturbances of peaceful parades . 
  how nice of you to leave out the reason why they 're protesting , as unbiased as you are ... 
  ouch , comparing fascism to anarchism ? 
  fascism is ultra-nationalist , anarchism does n't believe in nations . 
  fascism is totalitarian , anarchism has no government . 
  fascism has strong ties to the catholic church , anarchism is opposed to organized religion . 
  do n't get me wrong , i think this protest is pretty fucking stupid , but comparing anarchism to fascism because they both use violence is so extremely ignorant and only contributes to the degradation of political knowledge . 
  every 1st of may ? 
  send me one source to back up that pathetic statement . 
  may day is a day of celebration for the left , they have no reason to destroy . 
  edit : i 'm stupid and incorrect , downvote me and upvote the other guy . 
  seeing how somalia was already the focus of the discussion , your mind seems a little bit limited if all you can think are 2 things , 1 of which already being talked about . 
  really ? 
  * that 's * the first thing you think of ? 
  not revolutionary catalonia ? 
  not the ukrainian free territories ? 
  not really . 
  anarchy , as bakunin put it , is a sateless , classless society in which ther are no leaders , but democratic councils that make decisions for small communities . 
  it is similar to socialism in many regards .
