  however , anarchy now has become more of an edgy teenager ideology , mainly based on the punk philosophy of `` fuck the rules '' , ignoring most of the original writings and teachings of bakunin . 
  some good examples of anarchism ( or anarcho-communism ) are revolutionary catalonia , early israeli kibbutzes and the ukrainian short-lived free territory . 
  it 's really more chaos and instability , but there are some anarchist elements . 
  ok , i will admit that i did not know about that and that does ressemble anarchism a lot more than i thought . 
  very interesting article , thanks for the explanation . 
  / u/g99 definitely was n't wrong , but i still think calling somalia anarchist , or anything close to anarchism , is very questionable , since it has a government , an army , a police force and a representation in the un . 
  well , the reason i used that weird term is because / u/hilenkluas was referring to somalia as anarchist , even though somalia is , believe it or not , an actual country with an actual government , and therefor not anarchist . 
  also , i 've read most of bakunin 's , marxes and kropotkin 's work on the subject . 
  anarchism is a political system of democratic common ownership of goods and means of production in a society without rulers , but democratically elected councils . 
  see early israeli kibbutzes and revolutionary catalonia . 
  somalia has a government . 
  an army . 
  a police force . 
  a un seat . 
  they 're only extremely unstable and poor . 
  if anything , somalia is closer to libertarianism , in which the stronger force prevails with little interference from the government . 
  that does n't mean that it 's a libertarian nation , just that it 's not at all anarchist . 
  it has nothing to do with anarchy . 
  anarchy relies in democratic distributions of goods within leaderless communities . 
  it does * not * mean instability or lack of government , and saying so is pretty damn stupid . 
  ah , so * you * were the hormonal youth forgetting to take your meds , thanks for making that clear . 
  wait , do you actually think somalia is an anarchist state ? 
  wow , that is some hardcore ignorance . 
  yeah , marx and engels were totally hormonal youths ... 
  how do i extermination of native americans ?? 
  literally no one has said anything good about the soviet union in this thread . 
  we 're all talking about the poster . 
  i am in no way whatsoever justifying soviet war crimes . 
  i am simply pointing out that the reason slavs still exist today is because of the immense losses and determined fighting of the soviet forces . 
  aside from some lithuanian groups that hitler saw as `` good stock '' , the baltic peoples were also considered less than aryans and thus submissive servants . 
  alright , then ask half of africa to kill themselves , since obviously lots of their countries are considered shitholes . 
  between life and no life , the choice should be clear . 
  definitely to live in a shithole . 
  undeniably . 
  interesting read . 
  however , i still do n't see anything but an extremely dreary future of submission for the baltic states in case of an axis victory . 
  all i saw that was `` positive '' was hitler admitting that lithuanians of `` good stock '' could be racially integrated , and that 's a pretty limited part of all the baltics . 
  actually , it was . 
  slavs were seen as lesser beings , so they were to be used as a `` slave-race '' , meant to work themselves to death for several generations until they went completely extinct . 
  just as a nice reminder , as awful as the soviet union was , without them the baltic and slavic nations would have been * exterminated * . 
  not occupied , not turned into stalinist dictatorships , completely and utterly slaughtered . 
  so you can not possibly act like hitler 's visions were n't far worse . 
  it 's not forbidden to talk about nazism in austria , it 's just very ignorant to mention it when the discussion is about us secession , a topic virtually unrelated in every way to austria . 
  ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_state_petitions_for_secession ) in a 2012 poll , 125 000 texans signed a petition demanding secession . 
  tens of thousands in almost every other state did as well . 
  some more proof of the 25 % : http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-09-20/1-4-americans-want-their-state-secede-us http://freedomoutpost.com/2014/09/poll-one-four-americans-want-state-secede/ http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/19/us-usa-secession-exclusive-iduskbn0he19u20140919 but sure , 1 in 8 austrians saying that hitler did `` some good things '' is far more worrying . 
  http://blogs.reuters.com/jamesrgaines/2014/09/19/one-in-four-americans-want-their-state-to-secede-from-the-u-s-but-why/ ** `` roughly 1 in 4 americans want their state to secede from the us '' ** 80 million people . 
  tiny . 
  everyone go read * homage to catalonia * right now !, 
  playing the nazi card on an austrian . 
  * how original * . 
  http://blogs.reuters.com/jamesrgaines/2014/09/19/one-in-four-americans-want-their-state-to-secede-from-the-u-s-but-why/ statistically , 1 in 4 ( roughly 25 % ) of all us citizens want their state to secede from the usa . 
  that 's around 80 ** million ** people , so a huge number . 
  a recent austria poll found that roughly 1 in 8 ( roughly 12 % ) believed that `` hitler did some good things '' , which whilst controversial , certainly do n't make them nazis . 
  you have no knowledge about my country . 
  stop acting like you do . 
  depends . 
  most eastern european immigrants are fairly skilled when it comes to carpentry and plumbing , since they are extremely handy and resourceful people . 
  i do n't know how it is for arabic , african or asian immigrants though . 
  wow , calm down , you 're at a rate of 1 swear/sentence . 
  the third-biggest party in most states ( aside from libertarian ) are pro-secession groups ( like the alaskan independence party ) , so the us being a nation devoted to unity is quite untrue . 
  oh , do n't act like you 've never seen them . 
  i even see loads of them in * new england * whenever i visit , and that part is renowned for being extremely liberal . 
  but to whom ? 
  and why the obsession with the rising south ? 
  i guess he means the two old ladies that he hears on the bus and that one newspaper vendor ... 
  yeah , if you have loads of oil ... also , the united arab emirates are a horribly country that treats its working class likes slaves and has gotten it 's inspiration from western ultra-capitalism and materialism . 
  i disagree with them , so of course they have crippling mental issues . 
  oh look , some guy with no understand of economy wants to fix the uk by kicking out competent , skilled immigrant workers and leaving the eu entirely , i should vote for that one . 
  also their advert `` change of tune '' was fucking hilarious . 
  yes , that 's why confederate flags , literally a symbol of secession and the opposite of unity , are so popular in the south . 
  yes , but not in education , or in the prison system , or in social security , or in military spending , or in foreign policy , or in wage gap , or in national surveillance ... 
  well , except that it actually happened ... 
  welcome to / r/europe . 
  aside from holodomor , what european genocides are the nations in question not admitting ? 
  they 're totally against it , of course . 
  one always had the choice to give up the property . 
  i know , it 's gruesome and terrible , but do n't act like the soviet union persecuted people due to something that the people themselves had no power over . 
  that 's not the same thing at all . 
  there 's a difference between being born in a way that displeases the state , and doing something that displeases the state . 
  the title is a complete lie , for starters . 
  just because one member of syriza once met dugin in the early 2000 's at a conference does not mean that the entire party ( which did n't even fucking exist back then ) has `` deep '' , `` long-standing '' ties with him . 
  the party is n't old enough to be long-standing towards anything . 
  and dugin is n't a `` fascist '' , a buzzword both the west and the east love to use to point out the `` spooky people '' , he is a `` national bolshevik '' and an eurasianist . 
   ** new greek government has deep , long-standing ties with russian ` fascist ' dugin ** please enlighten me as to how this article is anything but downright anti-syriza propaganda . 
  it 's a lot more open to free speech and pro-democracy but , yes , it is extremely biased . 
  i remember an article they released shortly after syriza 's victories in greece saying how they were essentially `` selling greece to russia '' due to their `` marxist '' views and because one guy met alexander dugin once . 
  but ... why not say partisan then ? 
  or party member ? 
  saying activist basically discredits all activism , left , or right , pro-communist or anti-communist . 
  activism is n't necessarily left-wing , it just means to engage in political life . 
  if you think being an activist means being a leftist , than you probably have never heard of lech walesa , a polish patriot and activist who started the solidarity movement . 
  i agree with everything in the lyrics ( excluding the last one , since i 'm a marxist ) , but i do n't understand * `` better to be a hoodlum than an activist '' * lech walesa was an activist . 
  the scholl siblings were activists . 
  without activism , the soviet bloc might not have fallen quite as easily . 
  are these lyrics literally saying it 's better to be a drunken vandal than someone who cares about his country/people/earth ? 
  i 'm loving the folks on / r/worldnews acting like syriza is to blame for the greek crisis . 
  because apparently , all governments are the same and they are all guilty . 
  one of them also was ultra-corporatist , and the other ultra-collectivist . 
  one had strong ties to the catholic church , and one was psychotically atheist .
