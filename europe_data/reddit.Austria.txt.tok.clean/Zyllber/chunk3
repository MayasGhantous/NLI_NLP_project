  i think neo-nazi terrorists should n't burn down buildings made to house refugees , guess i 'm just another silly left wing apologist !, 
  if you feel like taking a break , visit / r/europes , same as this but merciless on the racism . 
  been to marseille a few times , not the safest place in the world , but an incredibly fun city !, 
  love all the `` racaille '' !, 
  ah , it 's nice how people like you actually manage to make me feel ashamed of my heritage . 
  btw , i doubt you 're actually european , probably from the us . 
  eh , i 've been hearing this `` just one more month and then armageddon '' fear mongering for 3 years already . 
  so far , it 's not happened . 
  bunching all leftists together is an incredibly stupid move , because you willfully ignore the dozens of different sections and fractions of the left that exist , and they manage to disagree about pretty much everything . 
  i think a lot of golden dawn voters are just frustrated people with conservative views who voted gd as a kind of `` protest '' to the mainstream parties . 
  at least i hope it 's only that . 
  they 're centre-left now . 
  oh , do n't compare the kke to the golden dawn , that 's just ignorant . 
  sure , the greek communists are a rather crazy bunch in my opinion and way too stalinist for me ( i 'm saying this as a convinced marxist ) , but they 're neither as stupid nor as violent as golden dawn . 
  wow , a link to kia , one of the most reactionary subs i can think of . 
  whoops , you 're right . 
  misread something . 
  however , the article does mention violent attacks on refugees that happened in 2015 . 
  far right terrorism very much exists today . 
  and yes , burning down asylum centers ** which had people in them ** ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/21/us-germany-asylum-arson-iduskcn0pv1qs20150721 ) is very much an act of terrorism , the likes of which there have been ** 150 in 2015 alone ** . 
  ok , so it * will * feature a rabbi mutilating a baby 's genitals , though ? 
  so your t-shirt will feature a stereotypical jew with a crooked nose and shekels for eyes , right ? 
  no , but there have been several attacks led by far-right groups on asylum centers in the past few months . 
  are you seriously saying far-left terrorism is more common in europe today than far-right terrorism ? 
  why defend a point that is demonstrably false ? 
  how is that protecting anything ? 
  yeah , because blanquism and maoism have been as strong as the nsu lately ... 
  no , he 's saying that most likely , nothing will happen . 
  the bible does encourage selling your daughter into slavery , though . 
  the bible does encourage selling your daughter into slavery , though . 
  nah , whoever wrote that clearly has no love for muslims , unlike what the op predicted . 
  that is one big strawman . 
  hello from austria !, 
  thatcher was a despicable authoritarian piece of shit who fucked over scottland 's economy so hard and became so hated to this day there has never been more than a tiny handful of conservatives in scottland . 
  no , it was the first thing i found . 
  i do n't think wasting time and effort for someone who 's going to insult me anyway is a good idea . 
  i 'm not taking anything from someone [ who uses the star wars prequels as a basis of argument ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3k2nxx/germany_can_cope_with_500000_asylumseekers_a_year/cuub9wf?context=3 ) . 
  that comment perfectly explains why we decided to make our own subreddit . 
  come to / r/europes instead . 
  we 're based around smart discusssion and absolutely mercyless when it comes to unfiltered hatred and bigotry . 
  if you think germany 's national identity is nothing but nazi germany , you are a person void of culture . 
  no , letting in immigrants has always been a thing in the non-nationalist right , since they see the advantage of cheap labour . 
  as a marxist , i 'm always delighted to hear that my ideology is not only woefully underfunded , fractioned , split , and unrepresented as years of organizing and debating had told me , but is actually secretly controlling the eu and merkel , a conservative politician . 
  holy fucking shit you people are so thick . 
  the eu is not marxist , merkel is n't marxist , marxists do n't want to start a race war or whatever you 're talking about . 
  `` oh my god ! '', 
  `` heavens no . '', 
  christ ! '', 
  `` holy shit ! '', 
  `` oh god ... '' seriously , we have exactly the same use of words , except in arab they 're alle the same term , whilst we have variations . 
  it 's not a french music video unless wati b makes an appearance . 
  `` allah ackbar '' is a term many muslims and even non-muslim arabs use . 
  it can mean literally anything : happiness , joy , rage , grief , it 's a way to manifest their feelings . 
  yup , looking back at it , the early 2000 's were fucking crazy . 
  yes , because a religion of 1 billion people that one is born into is perfectly comparable to an ideology based around racial supremacy and genocide . 
  you fucking prick . 
  actually , around half of the people applying for asylum in germany are from the balkans , mostly kosovo , albania and serbia . 
  i 'm not saying there 's anything wrong with , i just think it 's kinda sad that you would put effort into something that serves no purpose other than annyoing people . 
  no , but i 've seen george bush claim that `` god told him '' to go to war . 
  well , i remember georg w bush saying that `` god told him '' to go to war in iraq . 
  no , the vast majority of them are in vienna . 
  it 's the only city in austria that can take in large amounts of people and is located directly where the refugees/immigrans enter the country . 
  you 're right , they 're turkish muslims , the arab number is far smaller . 
  still , many of them came here as economic migrants looking for a better life , and all the right-wingers warned us , decades ago , this would be the *** end of austria as we know it *** . 
  a few years later , vienna consistently ranks among the top 3 most livable cities in the world and the right-winger still tell us that after the turks , who did nothing , the yugoslavs , who did nothing , it will finally be the syrians who will cause the destruction of austria . 
  the irony of quoting margaret thatcher like she was some kind of economic genius is hilarious . 
  this guy gets it, 
  fucking nailed it . 
  yeah , really . 
  if people would interpret `` hell yeah !, 
  and `` oh my god ! '', 
  the same way they look at `` allah ackbar '' , they 'd think all christians were fundamentalists . 
   350,000 ethnic turks [ 6 ] ( including a minority of turkish kurds ) currently live in austria . 
  at about 3 % of the total population , they make up the biggest single ethnic minority in austria .

  at about 3 % of the total population , they make up the biggest single ethnic minority in austria . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_austria  according to eurostat , there were 1.27 million foreign-born residents in austria in 2010 , corresponding to 15.2 % of the total population . 
  of these , 764,000 ( 9.1 % ) were born outside the eu and 512,000 ( 6.1 % ) were born in another eu member state . 
  [ 5 ] and :  of these new citizens 110,000 came from the former yugoslavia and 90,000 from turkey . 
  considering pre-1985 naturalizations , in 2005 at least 18 % ( ** in vienna more than 30 % ** ) of the population was either foreign or of foreign origin . 
  honestly , i 'm quite surprised at how rude you are , vienna 's immigrant population is quite famous for being huge . 
  around 300,000 . 
  the numbers are increasing now because it 's less perilous to get to europe . 
  mexico is an incredibly massive country , with stable regions and unstable regions . 
  the same can not be said for somalia , in which the clear majority of the land is very unstable . 
  it definitely influences the statistics , true , but for example , vienna has an immigrant population of roughly 750,000 people or ~ 40 % , and our rape index is extremely low . 
  you did n't read the article . 
  they were given a survey , and they answered honestly . 
  how does that discredit anything i just said ? 
  and the charred ground must be shot into the sun !, 
  my friends from seattle told me it 's actually quite popular , like a local oddity . 
  that statue has literally no connection to russia/soviet union , it was placed there because the creator could n't get rid of it . 
  over 3 million people voted from them , do n't act like they 're insignificant . 
  they most likely wo n't earn more than you , and they 'll have an entire family to support . 
   mohammed caricatures on tshirts i too enjoy work and effort made solely in order to offend people . 
  why is the desire to work suddenly something derogatory ? 
  refugees have every right to want to find a job to keep themselves busy and help afford their lives in germany . 
  almost as good as `` there is no sex in the soviet union ! '', 
  gaddafi was a lousy cockroach of a human being , but at least he was a leader open to debate and had a serious vision of african unity . 
  removing him was a huge mistake and has enabled terrorism to experience a staggering surge in libya .
