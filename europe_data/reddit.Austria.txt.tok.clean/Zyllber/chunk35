  of course putin is going to mention the ethnic russian population !, 
  if you 'd really compare a lot of speeches , you 'd probably find that fdrs are very similar to hitlers . 
  does that mean that they have similar ideologies ? 
  they simply use similar speech tactis . 
  *euromaidanpress.com * i can literally not think of a more radically anti-putin news source than this one . 
  not that i disagree with them , it 's just that their bias is so hateful to the point of becoming caricatural . 
  wow !, 
  that 's never been said before !, 
  and it adds * so much * to the otherwise completely civil discussion !, 
  haha that ending statement was great . 
  `` stalin created a cult of personality because he didnt have one '', 
  source about the first to clap ending up dead ? 
  i know the ussr under stalin was a paranoiac hellhole , but i 've heard so many lies about this era that i can no longer believe anything without some proof . 
   was quite popular in the 30s and 40s yes , but that picture of him as a young man was taken at the turn of the century , around 30-40 years before your given time . 
  i few months ago , i would have agreed with you , but seeing how the economist has been behaving towards syriza , i can only say they are extremely biased and do n't even try to hide it a bit . 
  it 's 2015 and some europeans do n't have enough to wear shoes . 
  heartwarming to see that some people actually have the humanity to care for others . 
  well , you called me a disabled person living with a severe mental condition because i said something you did n't want to hear . 
  clever . 
  edit : i see you 've ninja-edited your post immediately after me responding to it , clever . 
  to bad you did n't include any actual arguments , or i might have to defend myself here . 
  its alright for them to add caricatures of muhammad , as long as they also include caricatures of jesus . 
  funny how all the right-wing catholic parties support the inclusion of offensive caricatures in a curriculum , let 's see of they enjoy their prophet being moked as well . 
  yes , but this is n't the case in this article . 
  they 're supposed to be `` controversial cartoons '' , which is definitely an insult to muslim schoolchildren , religious or just moderate . 
  100 % this . 
  i grew up in vienna , and the holocaust was hammered into our little skulls from day one : reading anne frank ( twice ) , hearing a survivor speak , visiting a concentration camp , reading `` abschied von sidonie '' ( book about the gypsy slaughter in nazi germany ) , visiting yearly museum exhibitions about the anschluss and nazi germany , watching a movie every year about it , etc. 
  now , i 'm not saying this is necessarily a `` bad '' thing , heck , my great-grandfather spend a year in buchenwald because he was openly anti-hitler in his village , so i 'm totally pro-remembering and educating all future generations about all the awful cruelties that occurred in this era . 
  however , if people are constantly being told about how awful it was , they start thinking `` i fucking get it . '', 
  and start not caring . 
  and this has nothing to do with the new generations being `` lousy '' or `` anti-intellectual '' or whatever the daily mail thinks it is today , but much more because they are constantly being reminded of it in school . 
  there 's a difference between teaching about extremism and just openly mocking a symbol that means a lot to a lot of people . 
  if they want to have muhammad caricatures , why do n't they add some caricatures of jesus , too ? 
  i 'm sure all the catholic parties supporting the muhammad caricatures will totally be okay with that . 
  beg pardon but are n't pretty much all those issues found in places where poverty and lack of education is rampant ? 
  his achievements in science are still unbeaten and he is a true pioneer of progress . 
  also , do n't forget that he lived in an era where very little was known about what happened in the kremlin . 
  the right-wing would always talk incessantly about the atrocious crimes that were being committed , and even though they were proven right eventually , at the time it was not uncommon for the opposition to lie shamelessly in order to demonize the enemy . 
  haha damn i did n't think i 'd make it that far . 
  no , i can assure everyone , i 'm a communist . 
  i 've read marx , engels , kropotkin , lenin , trotky , eagleton and zizek . 
  i just think that owning up to our mistakes is a mecessary component of being a communist . 
  do you honestly believe that a british union member in the 1890 's , who just wanted his children to be able to go to school and to have some forms of protection in his job , is comparable to some gulag executioner ? 
  if you think all communists are the same , then you either no nothing about history or you 've simply been brainwashed . 
  and the way you end your rambling rant leeds to believe just that . 
  it does n't , i 'm not saying we need one to reach the other , i 'm just explaining that just because bad things were done does n't mean that the good things do n't have any value anymore . 
  those 3 pioneers of science you mentioned are only seen as nazis now because they worked in nazi germany . 
  they simply worked in a system that would let them conduct their experiments and do their research , not because of ideological reasons . 
  wernherr von braun essentially gave up all of that anyway when he came to the us , right ? 
   communism can not be misread . 
  you really want to come off as politically illiterate as possible , do n't you ? 
  communism , by definition , is a stateless , moneyless system of shared economic wealth in which the means of production are controlled and shared by a direct democracy . 
  it exists in order to attain the system of socialism . 
  stalin believed that communism/socialism could be implemented in one country , therefore not being stateless , with a currency , therefore not being moneyless and totalitarian with a small elite in control of the population , therefore having neither shared ownership of the means of production nor a democracy . 
  this misreading of communism on stalins side was so extreme that many economic theorists today say that the soviet union was a system of state capitalism under stalins control . 
  hey , communist here . 
  let me try and clear some things up . 
  ** yes ** , the soviet union was a failed terror state . 
  ** yes ** , the khmer rouge were utterly insane , ** yes ** a mountain of skulls have been produced because of tyrants who have misread this ideology . 
  but for every corpse , there 's 100 children no longer working in a factory due to marxist union movements . 
  for every torture that happened 80 years ago , there 's a 1000 women eligible for presidency due to womens rghts . 
  for every khmer rouge , there 's a revolutionary catalonia and for every stalin , there 's an einstein , a picasso , a steinbeck , a camus and a kafka . 
  so when people say that all that communism has achieved is death , there is nothing left to do but to end the discussion , for these people are less than uninformed : they are * anti * - informed and clearly do n't care about being right or wrong . 
  it 's not repenting , it 's solely about admitting the mistakes our ideology has produced , and explaining why this should never hapen again . 
  we need to distance ourselves from stalinism . 
  as a communist , this is devastating . 
  this period is amongst the darkest of the 20th century , and needs to be known by everyone . 
  i thank men like solzhenitsyn who had the bravery to expose the terror regime of the ussr for what it was . 
  if we communists really want to make the world a better place , like we so often say we do , we must admit to our mistakes and ask for forgiveness . 
  only so can we truly become a humanitarian ideology again . 
  and that is final . 
  or in christian uganda . 
  your point ? 
  as much as i love some of the people on / r/europe , i do n't want to return to a place that is actively making me miserable . 
  the level of discussion has been deteriorating since months , but it was the comments on the '' #killallwhitemen case '' that really made me snap . 
  people calling some dispshit racist who made a stupid tweet `` the worst human alive '' , saying `` if she could , she would be the next hitler '' and people upvoting that shit * high * . 
  i love arguing with people , i love debate . 
  it 's why i 've been coming here for almost 2 years now . 
  but this ? 
  this is n't debate . 
  this is n't even conversation . 
  but the immigrants comitting crime also always happen to be poor . 
  so are people born into poverty . 
  * / r/europe : where the cold war never ended . 
  it 's the austrian way . 
  before anyone wants to blame it on immigration , copenhagen has a very high amount of immigrants and the highest in the entire country . 
  implying that the world is run by a certain ethnicity and religion and referring to said group of people as literally driven by nothing but money is * extremely * racist and antisemitic , especially when you consider austria 's role in the holocaust . 
  and where did '' #killalljews '' come from ? 
  you just made that up on the spot . 
  every single thing i said in the comment you are replying to was a fact . 
  she agreed to the comment . 
  she was forced to step down or get sued .

  exactly . 
  it was on her official facebook , someone commented that the many problems of the world go back to `` zionist money-jews '' and she answered , saying `` yes , you are right , i ca n't speak my opinion anymore . '', 
  she literally admitted to agreeing to this antisemitic garbage . 
  and it was either step down or get tried for hate crime and `` wiederbet\u00e4tigung '' ( glorification of nazi regime and belittling the holocaust ) , so she had no real choice . 
  do you even know what a `` diversity officer '' is ? 
  pro tip : someone without any real executive or legislative power whatsoever . 
  just a few days ago , an austrian politician agreed to the statement that `` zionist money-jews '' were a problem .
