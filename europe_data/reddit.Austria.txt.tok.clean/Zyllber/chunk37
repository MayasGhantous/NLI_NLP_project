  he was asking for a certain ethnic group to be discriminated against ? 
  how is that not hate speech ? 
  source for hdp being non-secular , they are the most progressive party in turkey at the moment . 
  do not believe this guy , he is spreading misinformation about an ultra-nationalist and violently extremist party in order to make them look better . 
   since the 1990s it has , under the leadership of devlet bah\u00e7eli , gradually moderated its programme , turning from ethnic to cultural nationalism and conservatism and stressing the unitary nature of the turkish state . 
  notably , it has moved from strict , kemalist-style secularism ** to a more pro-islamic stance ** , and has -- at least in public statements -- accepted the rules of parliamentary democracy . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/nationalist_movement_party#at_present great secular party you got going there . 
  they are so cleaned up of extremists , that their own leader still makes extremely racist statements like :  devlet bah\u00e7eli said that the attacks by mhp affiliated turkish youth on south korean tourists was `` understandable '' , telling the turkish news paper hurriyet that : `` what feature differentiates a korean from a chinese ? 
  ** they see that they both have slanted eyes . 
  how can they tell the difference ? '' . 
  ** charming . 
  i was talking about the muhajideen ... 
  what happened in ' 85 ?? 
  oh please , it 's super offensive . 
  it 's like calling a jew a kike . 
  but , it is a discriminatory term ? 
  it literally has the same etymology and meaning as n * gger ? 
  yeah , that is weird . 
  are you being brigaded ? 
  he 's an extremely nice guy and has a very large friend group , so i guess he does n't concern himself with the ramblings of some stupid old people anymore . 
  this is the correct answer . 
  racism is n't huge , but it 's definitely very high for a country that is so wealthy and has such a high level of education . 
  `` neger '' in german is 100 % discriminatory and is very much an offensive term . 
  obviously racist interactions with my friend did n't happen every day , but they did happen often enough for us to always sit as far away as possible from the elderly on tramways and things like that . 
  i mean , it 's not like the greens are left-wing either , but yeah , i see your point . 
  yeah , not because they 're communists or even lefties , simply because for some old guys it was the good old times , you have these kind of people literally everywhere . 
  this is completely anecdotal , but as a austrian , i feel like i should add this story : i have a friend called eric who was adopted from togo , due to his father dying of disease and his mother being to poor to take care of him . 
  we are both the same age and went to the same kindergarden and school together . 
  even though he was black , he spoke perfect german and had a stronger viennese accent than me . 
  there were many times when people were racist towards him , mainly old women on the tramway not wanting to sit next to '' * ein neger * '' ( a n * gger ) , but sometimes it would come from younger people , too , calling him a monkey and all sorts of awful stuff . 
  point is , racism is n't really widespread , systematic or a huge problem in austria , but it is definitely still alive and well . 
  ** edit : who gives a fuck whether or not `` neger '' is as bad is nigger , the point is that many people did n't want to sit next to him * because of his skin colour * , and that 's racist no matter what term they used . 
  der standard is centre-left at best , not left wing at all . 
   removing communist influence what ? 
  i 've been to the east twice , once before the fall and once afterwards . 
  aside from a few old nostalgists and a surplus of atheists , all forms of the gdr have dissapeared . 
  i was n't aware a bunch of liberal arts students with their breasts out were a big enough threat to `` destabilize europe '' . 
  afghanistan was a brutal monarchy before the revolution . 
  and source on all those numbers . 
  i also remember afghanistan before the us supplied arms to the muhajideen , radical islamists who destroyed a secular and egalitarian communist rule . 
  many of them are living under us-sanctioned misery and corruption though . 
  so how much power does he have ? 
  so no fair trial to establish they are innocent ? 
  no witnesses , evidence portfolio , jury , all things that take months ? 
  you know who does execution by bullet , by a soldier ? 
  dictatorships . 
  the very first instance of the word terrorism being used applies to the french state controlling its citizens after the revolution , the period in history is literally called * la t\u00e9rreur * . 
  so , now that we 've established that you are ignorant about the issues , let 's move on to my friend , * who is the fighting in the ypg . 
  * not a terrorist , just happens to be fighting with kurds . 
  and the fact that you want him dead * solely * because ... what ? 
  what did he do to you ? 
  you are mostly accurate , however the large and successful ones began expanding into the free market after they had huge success with their socialist policies and decided to invest some of their revenue . 
  north korea is a stalinist monarchy and zimbabwe is an economic mess that has learned absolutly nothing from marxist philosophy . 
  was n't aware that mandela became a horrific dictator after coming to power . 
  every single us state conducted an investigation on it , and every single one came to the conclusion that the death penalty is more expensive than life without parole . 
  one example :  ** each death penalty case in texas costs taxpayers about $ 2.3 million . 
  that is about three times the cost of imprisoning someone in a single cell at the highest security level for 40 years . 
  ** http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty, 
  that 's what technology is for : to facilitate our lives . 
  also , the israeli kibbutzim have survived pretty well for the past 7 decades . 
  or you simply do away with nations and have everything run on a local scale , as marx intended . 
  well , yes , getting killed by a denied asylum claimant out of revenge is very much isolated . 
  however , several hundred people have died of car accidents in sweden alone this past yea , and the total number of car deaths is 1,2 * million * , far higher than any terrorist killings . 
  and that 's just cars . 
  so ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_traffic-related_death_rate ) so yes , i perfectly agree with you . 
  username : agreeorban redditor for 3 hours *** bravo . 
  okay , imagine no one dies from falling down stairs . 
  it 's still more likely that your op 's son dies in a car , train , bike or even airplane accident than that he is killed by an immigrant . 
  ah yes , sweden is literally taking `` millions '' now . 
  so where is the loop hole ? 
  and good job on ignoring my second point . 
  there were no `` legal loop holes '' , it was fucking murder and literally everyone called it that . 
  that 's why this guy is getting life . 
  and just because a murder is politicized , it will `` never happen again '' ? 
  wow , thank god all those school shootings in the us were so politicized , they never happen now !, 
  i agree . 
  long live mandela . 
  you do n't get to fucking say whether the families of the victims `` want justice '' or not . 
  in the us , it costs more to sentence people to death than to life without parole . 
  your son is still more likely to die falling down stairs then getting killed by immigrants , sorry to break it to you ... 
  it was actually oficially legislated after stalin died . 
  you forgot state terrorism . 
  same , i do n't like the people there very much ( a bit too nationalistic for my taste ) but i never got the feelig they were in any way religiously driven . 
  the funny thing is , communism * did n't * result in a famine when applied right . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zapatista_army_of_national_liberation they made sure no form of authoritarianism would ever be possible by establishing only local councils that had limited power and the figurehead of the movement , sub-commandante marcos ( `` sub '' because he said that the people were the real commandants ) stepped down from his position when he realized the people had no need for him . 
  he now lives in a farm collective in chiapas . 
  the result ? 
   the zapatistas have achieved documented improvements in chiapas in the areas of gender equality and public health , although they remain unable to establish political autonomy for the province . 
  seriously , i can not stress this enough , the zapatistas are a beautiful example of communism done right . 
   the october revolution abolished the laws which regarded the jews as an outlawed people . 
  [ 1 ] whilst the bolsheviks were opposed to religion , christianity as well as judaism , [ 8 ] the official stance of the soviet government in 1934 was to oppose antisemitism `` anywhere in the world '' and claimed to express `` fraternal feelings to the jewish people '' , praising the jewish contributions towards international socialism . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antisemitism_in_the_soviet_union whilst its true that judaism was frowned upon by stalin and his sucessors , this has absolutely nothing to do with ethnicity and everything to do with religion . 
  oh , and the soviet union never had jewish quotas . 
  you know who did ? 
  the united states . 
   certain universities , most notably harvard , introduced policies which effectively placed a quota on the number of jews admitted to the university . 
  the likud pander to religious extremists whilst still being relatively moderate , they are anti-lgbt rights ( if they were pro , they 'd be legal by now ) , and many high ranking members ( such as the former minister of transport ) have made inflammatory statements about `` cleansing israel '' . 
  so they 're exactly like the likud , but pro-arab . 
  because the amount of serious crimes committed by immigrants is very small , almost non-existant ? 
  also , i was talking about / r/europe .
