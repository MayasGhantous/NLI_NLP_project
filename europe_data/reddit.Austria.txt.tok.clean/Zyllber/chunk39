  not `` 7-12 million '' , no idea where you found that . 
  millions ? 
  what ? 
  yeah , but that 's not unemployment . 
  that 's just a dream . 
  anyway , i feel like humans inherently need to occupy themselves with something , so you better pick up some hobbies , or you 'll be bored out of your mind . 
  the feeling of guilt , extremely low self-confidence and depression is torturous . 
  and how exactly do you know what actual torture is ? 
  not doubting you , just kinda suspicious since your account is one month old and literally all your comments are about immigrants . 
  ah , so all muslims know everything about all other muslims , like who is a criminal of an unsolved case and where they live . 
  except you 'd be locked up in a cramped building , waiting weeks for a visa to be able to leave for a few hours and not having enough money to rent books at a library , watch a movie or go to the museum . 
   maybe if they worked together with police to get the criminals there arrested would a white person or a christian be obligated to help the police if the criminal is white or christian ? 
  why would someone have to work extra hard and be extra polite just because he was born with a certain skin tone ? 
  good . 
  lenin hated the cult of the personality , he would have preferred this . 
  that 's called a gap year . 
  being free from school and independent for the first time in your life is different than being limited to endless boredom and lack of purpose , especially when you are an adult . 
  does this even need an answer ? 
  it 's really not that simple . 
  the kuomintang was mostly a protest party against the status quo , which is why it was initially very popular across the spectrum . 
  being unemployed is torture . 
  the amount of boredom , especially when being contained in a shelter like these immigrants , will really make you insane . 
  are you sure you 're not confusing antisemitism with being anti-israel ? 
  that makes ... no sense . 
  ok , so yasser arafat is n't even mentioned in the article , you make a comment about the `` good old times '' , which could mean up 150 years ago , and expect me to think you were talking about something unrelated to the article that happened one decade ago ? 
  so the `` good old times '' being not even 15 years ago ? 
  how the hell was i supposed to guess that ? 
  but i 'm a pretty hardline leftist and i have absolutely no problem with moderate jews , same as with moderate muslims . 
  why would me wanting less capitalism immediately means i hate jews ? 
  wow , you know nothing of history !, 
  karl marx was a jew . 
  leon trotsky was a jew . 
  since the affaire dreyfus at the end of the 19th century , the left and the right were split on the issue of supporting jews . 
  the left chose to support them , the right chose to vilify them . 
  during the interwar period , fascists accused the soviet union of being `` judeo-bolshevik '' and accused marxism of being inherently jewish . 
  in fact , the parties with the highest jewish membership were always socialist and communist parties . 
  how can one be so incredibly ignorant ? 
  yes , i read the communist manifesto , written by a jew , joined a trotskyist organization , founded on the ideals of a jew , and decided that jews were the enemy . 
  wait what ? 
  literally the top comment right now : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pgoxs/fourth_asylum_home_on_fire_in_west_sweden/cw688d5 here are a few more : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pgoxs/fourth_asylum_home_on_fire_in_west_sweden/cw6jnuh https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pgoxs/fourth_asylum_home_on_fire_in_west_sweden/cw68z43 https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3pgoxs/fourth_asylum_home_on_fire_in_west_sweden/cw69ib6, 
  there are several million brits living in spain iirc . 
  britain has a life sentence without parole in their justice system . 
  britain enforces solitary confinement . 
  if you receive the aforementioned sentence , and you are a young man , as the majority of violent extremists are , then you will spend half a century in a 10 foot cell . 
  the chp is centre-left at best . 
  mostly , their centrist . 
  how many gay rights has been outlawed because of muslims in the uk ? 
  what i 'm saying is that both groups refuse to integrate . 
   and a blond girl there was no reason , at all , to add that . 
  but thanls for clearing up what kind of a person you are . 
  i 'm obviously exaggerating . 
  still , my point was that brits complain about integration and then refuse to do exactly that when they move to southern countries by the millions . 
  the hdp is n't the `` kurdish version '' of the chp . 
  it 's a left-wing party that shares no history at all with the chp . 
  one of the top posts right now is blaming the immigrants . 
  dozens of comments are agreeing . 
  no , it 's more like shooting a kid in the head so he wo n't grow up to potentially become a robber . 
  yes , people who flee from war , death and misery are all inherently violent and want to recreate what they fled from !, 
  you people are sick in the head !, 
  yes , `` cearly '' . 
  it 's just so obvious people who burn down their only home in winter to ... do what again ? 
  that would be the most considerate and smartest thing to do . 
  shame islamist extremists and old british people are n't usually considerate . 
  what about ultra-nationalist terrorism ? 
  100 % british people committing hate crimes . 
  solitary confinement for life without parole ??? 
  literally being stuck in the same 10-foot cell alone for half a century is worse than death if you ask me . 
  ever been to the south of spain ? 
  crawling with british people , who have lived there for decades , complaining about how spain should be more `` british '' . 
  they do n't even attempt to integrate . 
  ** `` jesus said he had come at this time to not bring peace on earth , but a sword , a weapon which divides and severes . 
  '' ** wow , that actually sounds extremely violent . 
  and he then goes to say , as you already linked , that you must place your family and friends behind him or else you are not worthy of his love and will suffer eternally . 
  sounds pretty violent . 
  it is a fact that churchill was begged to send food to benghal by the authorities and he rejected it , even after thousands had already died . 
  i do n't care what ghandi thought , because we are n't talking about ghandi . 
  in france , meals are normally payed by the school , so everyone has access to them . 
  what , the people commenting on / r/europe one year ago were n't `` actual citizens '' ? 
  lmao what a stupid thing to say . 
  literally no government in the eu says it 's ok for non-eu citizens to travel through europe the way they are doing right now . 
  they are simply realizing that this is a huge crisis and are doing their best to contain it . 
  george orwell , mark twain , albert einstein , helen keller , franz kafka and pablo picasso were also adherents of variants of communism . 
  do n't act like being a communist makes you naturally evil . 
  yeah , they got along so well they slaughtered each other by the millions . 
  such good friends ... 
  churchill caused entirely preventable famines in india , then blamed it on `` the indians breeding like rabbits '' and said it was `` a shame '' ghandi had n't died in them . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bengal_famine_of_1943  `` if food is so scarce , why has n't gandhi died yet ? '', 
   winston churchill 's response to an urgent request to release food stocks for india . 
  just because winston `` palestinians are savages who eat camel shit ( yes , he actually said that ) '' churchill is celebrated in britain does n't make him a hero . 
  you know they 've barely gained 3 % this election , right ? 
  it 's not like there was a legitimate shift in opinions . 
  who gives a shit what polish people think about merkel ? 
  it 's not like they have an influence on the elctions . 
   and it is reality right now you are aware that the reason we can move through countries is because * border controls * are gone , not borders . 
  it 's the shengen agreement , and it was pioneered and stronly backed by centrist liberals . 
   radical leftists uh , no . 
  no no no no . 
  if you think allowing refugees to stay in your country for a limited amount of time and deporting those who 's request was denied is radical leftist , then you have absolutely zero understanding of politics . 
  yeah , cameron , merkel , duda , orban , hollande , such radical leftists . 
  are you serious ?
