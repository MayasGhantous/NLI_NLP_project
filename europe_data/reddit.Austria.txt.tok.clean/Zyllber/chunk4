  do n't be fooled . 
  orban is a selfish asshole who said that `` dictatorships work better than democracies '' and then acted surprised when there was a backlash . 
  the fence is * notorious * for not working in america , just saying . 
  the reason sweden has a much higher rape index than other countries is because certain sexual assaults that most nations would n't characterize as rape are considered rape in sweden , and the swedish government is far more open to the idea that men can be raped and need treatment , which most countries still ignore , therefore skewing the statistics . 
  you know that iraq and somalia are currently extremely unstable war zones , right ? 
  i mean , iraq is literally home to isis and somali has become notorious for its vicious rule of the thug amidst pirates , gang violence and terrorism . 
  i do n't see how these people ca n't possibly be refugees . 
  i agree , turkey simply ca n't take care of that amount of refugees , they have done nothing wrong in that regard . 
  these `` entitled cunts '' were given a survey . 
  they answered honestly . 
  stop jerking yourself off to pictures of orban and read the fucking article . 
  as an austrian , i agree that we could easily help our current asylum seekers better , but the situation in turkey is way worse , they have hundreds of thousands just roaming the country , without a place to stay or a vision for the future . 
  because the eu and eu members helped destabilize the middle east and are partially to blame for not intervening earlier . 
  it is now confirmed impossible to have an / r/europe thread without mentioning refugees . 
  you appear to be right . 
  source on the rape . 
   what atrocities they commit oh please . 
  i admit that a lot of immigrants have been behaving in extremely questionable ways , but none of them have commited serious enough crimes one could call `` atrocities '' . 
  yes , i 'm sure ban ki-moon gets all of his information from bbc . 
  it 's not like he probably hears about everything hours before it hits the news . 
  to be honest we have people who are 100 % european citizens who oppose all of those things you mentioned vehemently . 
  not saying that makes it alright , but it 's not like intolerance only comes from immigrants . 
  lmao when was yank ever not used as a deragatory term ? 
   control most of the media as a leftist , it 's always refreshing to know that i have such huge amounts of power . 
  actually , allah ackbar is used for anything remotely good , i 've seen arabs in vienna use it when scoring a goal at a casual sports game . 
  watch arabs seeing a rainbow , half of them will be shouting aa because of how pretty it is . 
  it 's used in the same way we use `` hell yeah ! '', 
  or `` oh my god '' . 
  yeah , muslims get up in the morning , chant allah ackbar for 18 hours straight and then go to bed again . 
  it 's true , though . 
  islamic radicalism as a worldwide ideology only really kicked of after the islamic revolution in ' 79 . 
  before that , it was extremely isolated . 
  please , tell me more about how north korea is a stateless , moneyless community in which the means of productions are shared equally and democratically among the working class . 
  i do n't like using this infantile term very much , but i sense some butthurt in this general direction . 
  right-wing wins : `` the people have spoken !, 
  democracy at work ! '', 
  right-wing loses : `` this shows the power of television propaganda ! '', 
  yeah , no . 
  i get it . 
  however , i remember the right-wing in austria precisely warning about the `` poor , intolerant '' young men who would `` bring crime '' , which never really happened . 
  that map has no source or context . 
  for all i know , it could mean `` countries with the letter a in them '' . 
  `` support me , your friendly neighborhood tyrant instead ! ', 
  according to the koran , you are not allowed to kill others . 
  calling isis a literal interpretation of it is ridiculous , it 's just cherry-picked bullshit . 
  this . 
  it 's not terribly uncommon , and as you said , manifests itself in many different ways , like loving murderers and rapists ( remember the huge fan base bundy had ? ), 
  so why did we get over 100,000 refugees from yugoslavia if it was so great in croatia then ? 
  could they have been economic migrants ? 
  when has extremist islam last affected latin america ? 
  or the pacific islands ? 
  the lra represents christian values the same way isis represents islamic values . 
  not at all . 
  i always thought the word `` news '' implied it was actually new , and not months old . 
  never heard of the lra , i see . 
  except in africa . 
  ever heard of the lord 's resistant army ? 
  not nice people . 
  if people with your opinions had been more successful in the austrian elections , 100s of thousands of refugees from the balkans who have been sent back to their war-torn countries , facing poverty and death . 
  no , but i am saying that the exact same arguments that were being used against yugoslavians are being used today against syrians . 
  you do n't * want to know * was kaiser franz joseph was . 
  i remember when 10,000 's of croatians were refugees in austria . 
  the right-wingers said you 'd bring crime , intolerance and the death of austria with you . 
  but of course you did n't . 
  now , 2 decades later , you 've become your own former enemy . 
   implying juche is socialist / r/badpolitics and / r/badhistory all at once . 
  north korea is a monarchy , nothing socialist about it . 
  that image could mean anything . 
  i literally have no idea what it 's saying and who said it . 
  how is not speaking turkish hypocrisy ? 
  yeah , north korea totally has open borders , excellent example , well memed . 
  a croatian complaining about refugees in austria . 
  this has got to be the cutest thing i 've seen all week . 
  great . 
  a facebook macro in a language i ca n't read . 
  i ca n't handle the amount of proof that is . 
  meanwhile , none of you have as much as mentioned my source about the grey wolves , for which i have supplied definite proof . 
  i believe you , it 's just that i have never heard the term `` redpilled '' used outside of that context . 
  yeah , the good old days . 
  their `` king '' was actually the infamously cruel shah , whos crimes and horrific human rights abuses were only tolerated by the western powers because he sold cheap oil to them . 
  sure , khomeini was n't much better , he was actually worse in many things , but acting like the shah was ana acceptable leader for even one second is terrible white-washing of history . 
  life in a refugee camp in turkey is a 100 % chance that your children will become criminals or prostitutes . 
  lmao 1 million for germany . 
  has the bloated 800,000 number ( that is almost 50 % people from the balkans ) become too small already ? 
   some say have we replaced trustworthy sources with tavern hear-say ? 
  meanwhile , you ignored the source proving that the grey wolves are extremely racist , have posted zero sources , have accused me of spreading propaganda , have mocked my grandfather , an armenian genocide survivor , and have accused me of something i have never said . 
  is this satire ? 
  uh , no . 
  the pkk is against the turkish state and arab countries such as syria and iraq as they currently exist , but you wont find a single member hating turks or arabs because of their ethnicity . 
  ** however ** , the grey wolves you love so much are * extremely * racist , from their attacks towards kurds based on ethnicity to their murder of south korean tourists :  their ideology is based on the ** `` superiority '' of the turkish race ** and the turkish nation . 
  they strive for an ` ideal ' turkish nation , which they define as sunni-islamic and mono-ethnic : only inhabited by ` true ' turks . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/grey_wolves_ ( organization ) #ideology but please , tell me more about how the racist fascist ultra-nationalists are the good guys . 
  you can accuse the pkk of a lot of things , nationalism , communism , terrorism , but racism ? 
  how the fuck does that make sense ? 
  grey wolves are literally a neo-fascist organization . 
  how the fuck do people here talk positively of them ? 
  in terms of population , yes it is . 
  look at sub-saharan africa . 
  there , christianity is the problem . 
  do n't you people realize it 's social context that causes extremism ?
