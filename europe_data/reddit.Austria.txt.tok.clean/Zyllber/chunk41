  you 're one of those walking american stereotypes i hear about so often , are n't you ? 
  you care about your country * so much * you would murder hundreds of civilians , whose innocence would only be revealed after their execution . 
  you care about your country * so much * you would rather ignore basic human rights and decency , whilst simultaneously torturing and ruthlessly assassinating civilians in the third world because their countries `` are the axis of evil '' . 
  only someone who truly hates the people of his country would call a human right `` sheer idicoy '' and would back up his sutpidity with `` it 's the law '' , something i often heard when speaking to east germans pre-1989 about their rights . 
  you are a sheep . 
   human trash people who would be condemned to death in some countries get life without parole here , so they do n't get a second chance . 
  also , calling potential innocent civilians `` human trash '' is horrifying . 
  apartheid was part of south africa 's legal system . 
  it 's not italian culture . 
  thats like saying star wars is a classic example of greek culture , because its inspired by the greek hero story . 
  it still does n't apply . 
  uh , what do the gr\u00fcnen have to do witht this ? 
  you know that more than one party supports pro-refugee policies in austria , right ? 
  if i am right , pro-refugee parties ( sp\u00d6 , die gr\u00fcnen , neos , and , to am extent \u00d6vp ) should receive far more votes than the fp\u00d6 , which they will . 
  except for greece . 
  and corbyn . 
  and whenever the soviet union is mentioned . 
  seriously , the only thing / r/europe is left-wing about are social issues like lgbt rights and women 's rights ( and even the `` feminazi ! ', 
  becomes a popular term ) . 
  economically , they are left when it comes to the ttip , but liberal on literally everything else . 
  the statue was by jeff koons , a contemporary american artist , no connection to italian culture ... read the stupid article . 
  and a lot of front page news is from breitbart , the daily mail , bild and other extremely untrustworthy sources . 
  yeah , several million refugees left to slowly starve or turn to crime and prostitution in syrias neighbourstates only came to germany because of one picture of merkel . 
  because that is how human beings work . 
  trusted sources like the front page of / r/europe ? 
  too bad for your strawman that the people who did this were all immigrants from the balkans , mostly kosovo and serbia i.e. 
  * white christians * . 
  what does this have to do with the amount of people applying for asylum in austria and the likelihood of germany taking them in afterwards ? 
  the linked part you posted does n't even mention germany . 
  yes , delete your embarrassing comments , please . 
  which has not happened yet , thus it 's purely speculation . 
  `` relative to its population , austria has received the most asylum requests . '', 
  *** fact . 
  *** `` the vast majority of asylum seekers in austria will leave for germany . '', 
  *** pure speculation . 
  that is a complete speculation . 
  did you read what i posted ? 
  relative to its population , austria has received the most ** asylum requests ** , which means that people will have to stay there in order to get work , for their kids to go to school , to have access to social security , etc. 
   germany , the u.s. , turkey , sweden and italy are receiving the largest number of asylum requests , it said , ** with austria receiving among the most for the size of its population . 
  ** http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-22/europe-s-record-asylum-requests-are-the-new-normal-oecd-says, 
  merkel is a progressive capitalist . 
  she is only social democratic by warped us standards , she 's right-wing for europe . 
  in terms of population percentages , austria is taking in more immigrants than germany , fyi . 
  checking someone out is *** not *** the same as `` wanting to rape someone '' . 
  comparing them is disgusting . 
  did your friend ever consider that maybe they were just experiencing a culture shock ? 
   who look like they want to rape her what the actual fuck is that supposed to mean ? 
  once you would have been lynched for being gay . 
  what 's your point ? 
  the cdu is a right-wing party and germany has a right-wing government . 
  am austrian , live right across from the westbahnhof , the main center of refugees who arrive on a daily basis in the thousands , have n't felt anything whatsoever . 
  comparing jeremy corbyn to golden dawn ? 
  the poor guy has n't even done anything yet and he 's already as bad as literaly nazis . 
  ugh , comparing marxists to bolshevik assassins is such a cheap move . 
  have you ever read any marxist litterature ? 
  the most violent protests having often yielded the best results . 
  haymarket anyone ? 
  because this subreddit is a lost cause . 
  does your ass ever get jealous of how much shit your mouth produces ? 
  yeah , how dare they protest losing their jobs and consequently their main source of income !, 
  i have lived in vienna my whole life , the rent is cheap , the food is good and the culture is wonderful . 
  difference is , the far-right also predicted the end of austria in 1956 , when 180,000 hungarians came , in the 70 's , when tens of thousands of turks came , in 91-94 , when over 100,000 jugoslavs came and today , with the syrians . 
  in austria , none of the things they predicted became true : our crime went down , our quality of life went up , we have had literally zero islam-based terror attacks ( the far-right leads that poll ) and we have generally not changed at all . 
  do you realize how anecdotal this is ? 
  you ' r summing up several hundred years of good relations with the nazi gold trope . 
  are you still mad at spain because of what happened in cuba 110 years ago ? 
  what a strong argument that will definitely make me stop and consider the other side, 
  what kind of reasoning is this ? 
  switzerland has been friendly to you for 300 years , shouldnt you trust them more ? 
  this is incredibly naive and stupid reasoning , you simply ignore government , geopolitics , culture , and policies in favor of being buddies for a while . 
  ah , so this is an ethnic thing . 
  why am i not surprised . 
  you 're really trusting a country more because your ancestors used to live there ? 
  how ridiculous . 
  trust the prime minister who was pro-immigration and pro-eu 2 years ago and is now against both of those things because he wants to gain votes . 
  please , your loss . 
  you 'd trust a country that has an undemocratic system of representation , in which 37 % of the vote gets you an absolute majority , in which a right-wing prime minister changes his opinions on a monthly basis in order to keep his voters , over a country like denmark , which consistently outranks the uk in everything always ? 
  dear god . 
  here 's a thought : the united nations are ineffective , crippled , weak and stunted , but they are not * untrustworthy * . 
  you know which country is extremely untrustworthy , a government you can never really trust , even if it 's your supposed ally ? 
  the united states of america . 
  and i 'm saying this as a half-american . 
  many americans i have met hate the un , and because they call it , like you do , `` anti-american '' . 
  if literally the organization representing the fucking world keeps reminding you that something 's wrong with your policies , maybe take the hint ? 
  sounds like i should keep supporting unions , then . 
  his source is that the who constantly critiques the us for acting like the 19th century when it comes to healthcare . 
   all the great things de gaulle achieved you have got to be kidding me . 
  so , actually , everything people say about immigrants being 10 times more responsible for rape was just speculation ? 
  there are thousands of kids below the age of 16 fleeing though , 10 's of thousands probably , and ignoring them because grownups do it too is ridicolous and an affront to human rights . 
  it does , however , mean that the vast majority of them are arabs . 
  islam is the second biggest religion in austria , after all . 
  uh , that was not the end of the demo . 
  i was there . 
  when the first people entered the parliament , most people were still walking down the mariahilferstrasse . 
   did a study then please link the study  i imagine ah , so you do n't know . 
  der standard , heute , das wirtschaftsblatt and die presse all state 20,000 as the * minimum * given by the police , who are known for always giving smaller numbers . 
  either way , the concert was called `` voice for refugees '' and was organized by the #refugeeswelcome groups , so attending means supporting , no doubt about it . 
   ** sweden also has a comparatively wide definition of rape . 
  ** [ 232 ] [ 233 ] [ 234 ] this means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries . 
  [ 233 ] for example , in 2005 ** sweden reformed its sex crime legislation and made the legal definition of rape much wider ** , [ 232 ] [ 240 ] [ 241 ] [ 242 ] which led to a marked increase in reports .
