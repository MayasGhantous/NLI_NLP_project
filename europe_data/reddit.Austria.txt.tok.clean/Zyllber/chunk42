  [ 243 ] [ 244 ] additionally , the swedish police have improved the handling of rape cases , in an effort to decrease the number of unreported cases . 
  [ 232 ] [ 244 ] [ 245 ] [ 246 ] for this reason , large-scale victimisation surveys have been presented by criminologists as a more reliable indicator of rape prevalence . 
  [ 232 ] [ 233 ] [ 234 ] an eu-wide survey on sexual violence against women , published the european union agency for fundamental rights ( fra ) in 2014 , showed sweden was only third highest , below denmark and finland [ 247 ] and a previous assessment by br\u00e5 have placed ** sweden at an average level among european nations . 
  ** https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/rape_statistics sorry man , but what you 're saying is just recycled stormfront garbage . 
  no , admittedly , you were right when you said it was n't 350,000 in vienna . 
  however , the initial point i was making , which you completely ignored , is that vienna has loads of muslims ( more than marseille ) and is still one of the world 's best cities to live in . 
  ah , but those are * different * muslims . 
  too bad you never even mentioned muslims , only `` islam '' , so it 's a little bit late for that one . 
  oh , and you 're surprisingly quiet about stockholm . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_austria#ethnic_groups  350,000 ethnic turks [ 6 ] ( including a minority of turkish kurds ) currently live in austria . 
  i understand that not all of them live in vienna , but the vast , vast majority does . 
  and the reason stockholm is known as the `` capital of rape '' is because they count male rape and sexual harassment ( like groping ) as rape as well , which other countries do not . 
  all these arguments have been debunked dozens of times already , why cling to lies ? 
  look at vienna , 350,000 muslims , and voted best city in the world for 3 years in a row . 
  maybe marseille is shit because of a bad infratrsucture and a dead-end endemic poverty ? 
  no , it 's because the media has been closely reporting all forms of islamic terrorism since 9/11 and has paid very little attention to others . 
  buddhist and hindu violence are real serious problems in se asia , but we barely ever hear about that . 
  oh , and fyi , far-right extremism is the leading cause of terror in europe , not islam . 
  vienna has the best living qualities in the world and consistently ranks in the top 3 best cities to live in every year . 
  it also have a 40 % foreign-born population , but that never hurt it like right-wingers have been predicting for roughly 200 years now . 
  the actual number of people who have attented the march was closer to 40,000 some newspapers putting it as high as 100,000 . 
  that is the biggest demo vienna has seen in decades . 
  the real number is between 40,000 and 100,000 . 
  i was there yesterday , great crowd , people from all over , left , centre , religious , secular , etc. 
  i did n't say terrorism , i said proto-terrorism , as in actions that can lead up to terrorism . 
  i think racially motivated hate crimes often conducted by far-right nationalists are a gateway to terrorism . 
   social unrest seriously , fuck you . 
  we 're talking about violent hate crimes . 
  then the scholars can have a discussion , seeing how they actually know their shit . 
  many organizations , like doctors without borders , amnesty international , international marxist tendency , etc. 
  and the united nations are desperately trying to improve the situations of hundreds of millions around the globe . 
  unfortunately , corruption is ever-present in unstable countries , for example in pakistan you practically ca n't get elected unless you ally yourself with gangsters . 
  and more often than not , the gangsters have more concerns about the country than the politicians !, 
  in the end , the third world is nothing but the playground of richer nations and their oligarchs . 
  and they do n't necessarily want things to change . 
  i thought public opinion was still largely pro-immigration ? 
  all the problems you addressed about islam are also problems that many conservative parties in poland share . 
  so should we get rid of intolerant , homophobic and sexist right-wing polish parties who refuse to recognize secularism and women 's rights ? 
  and yes , i was in the demonstration in vienna yesterday , in which between 40,000 and 110,000 people showed up , so much for `` austrians do n't want refugees '' . 
  you think violent hate crimes are an `` equal reaction '' to someone immigrating ? 
   causes problems we 're talking about violent hate crime . 
  yes , because 11 year olds do n't need literacy , basic healthcare and a minimum of education , seeing how those things are n't always available to them in the places they are leaving from . 
  how do you expect people to build a country when outside powers have fucked it up so hard ? 
  yes , that 's so incredibly easy , right ? 
  how are you going to convince 1 billion people to renounce to their beliefs because you think that literally anything else is meaningless ? 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  muslims write a progressive thesis , more progressive than many eu governments , may i add , you say it 's `` empty '' and `` meaningless '' and then suggest they `` do n't glorify it '' , which they never did in the first place . 
  they just ca n't win . 
  so what 's your suggestion ? 
  let me guess , `` get rid of islam '' . 
  i just love how this guy thinks he knows more about the quran than the educated islam scholars who have spent years studying it who wrote the theses . 
  what ? 
  this is more basic vandalism than extremist violence or even terrorism , tbh . 
  antifa is radically anti-government , ultra-secular and hate both labour and torries with a passion , so i doubt what you said is true . 
  why do people keep saying this ? 
  the far-left is absolutely ignored by mainstream media . 
  to me , extremism starts becoming an undeniably bad thing once it hurts those who have absolutely nothing to do with the conflict in question . 
  for example , persecuting the bush administration for treason , fraud and war crimes is an extremist idea , but there is sense behind it and it does n't cause harm to innocent civilians . 
  [ less than 2 % of terrorist attacks in europe are religiously motivated . 
  ] ( https://thinkprogress.org/less-than-2-percent-of-terrorist-attacks-in-the-e-u-are-religiously-motivated-cec7d8ebedf6 ) terrorism is n't just killing people . 
  it 's also assault , looting and vandalising stores , harassing people and all in all creating an atmosphere of dread and threat for certain groups of people . 
  the comment above is a fucking meme .

  ] ( https://thinkprogress.org/less-than-2-percent-of-terrorist-attacks-in-the-e-u-are-religiously-motivated-cec7d8ebedf6 ) there 's your source . 
  far-right extremism is the leading case of terrorism in europe . 
  just fyi . 
  when the european union was first theorized about , europe looked at france for guidance . 
  and you , the french , answered willingly . 
  you were always the most optimistic , the most enthusiastic , the most inventive when it came to the creating of a unified europe . 
  it mattered not whether you were conservative or socialist , you demanded the eu . 
  even though some of us were ( and still are ) reluctant , we ultimately joined , under your guidance . 
  now , the time has come where we need the union the most . 
  with the east crumbling and the west threatening , amidst economical meltdown and worldwide revolution , we needed the european union the most . 
  how could you , france ? 
  how could you cast your vote to racists , to jew-haters , to bigots and holocaust-deniers . 
  how could you accept these people to represent your incredible nation ? 
  how could you ? 
  i 've gotten many mixed feelings about this figure , for some he represents a broken system , for others a symbol of transparency ? 
  who is he to you ? 
  dedicated to our workers , who have suffered so much in the past , from both left and right . 
  may they be rewarded for their labour and remembered for their contributions to society . 
  in honor of a recent text post by / u/siriuscili suggesting we take a closer look at european cinema , here is a short rundown and analysis of the austro-german expressionist movie that is `` metropolis '' . 
  ** some cinematography : ** http://imgur.com/a/b9ysh ( courtesy of / u/goodgoodnotbaddd ) ** synopsis : ** in the ( no longer ) distant future of 2026 , the world as we know it has been split between wealthy industrialists living in luxurious high-rises and an army of workers toiling in hard labour underground the vast city of metropolis . 
  freder , the son of the master of metropolis , lives an idle life amongst the rich lusting after women in pleasure gardens . 
  however , his sinful existence is disrupted by the arrival of maria , a prophetic figure that preaches the arrival of a mediator between rich and poor to the workers below . 
  falling in love with her instantly , freder ventures into the factories underground in an attempt to find her , and is shocked to see the atrocious working conditions of his father 's employees . 
  finding secret plans in a workers pocket , freder brings them to the brilliant , if eccentric , scientist rotwang , who he finds out had been working on a `` machine-human '' that could think and act like a human . 
  rotwang wants the machine to take the appearance of hel , the dead mother of freder whom rotwang loved dearly . 
  freder learns of marias prophecy and decides to become the mediator between the different classes . 
  however , freder 's father , the master of metropolis , is well aware of the workers uprising being caused by maria , and orders rotwang to have his machine-human take her likeness and slander her name , which he does after having kidnapped the original maria . 
  the fake maria , a robot following the masters orders , leads a doomed workers rebellion , in which the poor rampage across metropolis and finally destroy the heart machine , the central power station of the city . 
  due to the city 's power being shut down , the underground workers city floods , killing all the children the rampaging workers left behind . 
  wounded by grief , the workers accuse the machine of being a demon and burn it at the stake . 
  freder liberates maria and becomes the mediator between the workers and the master . 
  the movie ends with a sentence reading ** `` the mediator between the head and the hand must always be the heart !, 
  '' ** ** analysis : ** even though the movie flopped at the box office ( it was incredibly expensive to make and cost up to 5 million mark ) , it has become a landmark of cinema , with it 's use of perspective camera , landscape shots , blinding the audible and the visual and beautiful models of the futuristic city . 
  ** ratings : ** disclaimer : these are all based on my viewing of the film . 
  i am not a film critic , nor do i have a job related to cinema , so disagreeing is more than natural and encouraged . 
  cinematography : ** 9/10 ** music : ** 8/10 ** plot : ** 8.5 / 10 ** cast : ** 8/10 ** set design : ** 9.5 / 10 ** overall rating : ** 8.5 / 10 ** excellent movie . 
  would recommend to everyone with an interest in cinema , especially early expressionism .
