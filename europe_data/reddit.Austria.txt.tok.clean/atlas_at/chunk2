  tja . 
  we did n't want to become prussia 's lapdog . 
  rightfully so . . es prei\u00dfn . 
  i understand that you are wary of editorialization . 
  i was just excited to see my home state on the front page of / r/europe . 
  the link is just the first `` hochrechnung '' ( i do n't know what 's the english name for that ) . 
  op had to pick a title and the big story of the day is that our right-wing anti asylum party got 30 % of the votes . 
  so i guess you are familiar with austrian politics then ? 
  tell me please why the fp\u00d6 should not be considered nationalistic ? 
  [ legends say that on sunny days you can still see him singing in the alps after he raided slovenian town signs . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/rjzc41duw2k?t=43s ), 
  those are the [ sorbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbs ) . 
  they are remnants of the slavic people who once settled in eastern germany but eventually got driven out or were assimilated by germans . 
  the sorbs are the last bastion . 
  they are mostly catholic which helped them to retain an own identity in a protestant region . 
  edit : there are also a lot of city names of slavic origins in germany . 
  these names got germanized but are easily recognizable by the endings - ow or - itz . 
   the faster the eu dissolves , the better . 
  what does this have to do with the eu ? 
  do you think merkel would take less refugees if germany was n't in the eu ? 
  edit : missing word . 
  they could at least write : this thread is now delisted because of an untrustworthy source , etc. 
  let 's see when this thread will be deleted . 
  why are so many threads deleted without a mod giving a short explanation ? 
  it seems like everytime i start a discussion in / r/europe the thread will disappear after 2 hours . 
   at least playing on people 's xenophobic tendencies to gain power . 
  that 's right . 
  they are populists who 'd say everything just to gain power or get more votes . 
  but why are there so few other parties who actually care about the worries of their citizens ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  ruling parties bitch about right wing populists gaining votes but they do nothing . 
  they just do n't listen to what most of their population is worried about . 
  i can just speak for austria so maybe this situation does n't suit other countries . 
  sometimes one could think that they want people to vote for these populists . 
   the religion as a whole does n't have one driving intention to destroy the rest . 
  i 'm not sure about that . 
  whilst there are many secular muslims , if you practice your religion how it 's usually done in the arab world ( the whole view on society , family , gender roles , infidels , our law system etc ) there is a clearly visible pattern . 
  christianity was there once too 1000 years ago but fortunately these times have changed . 
  there is only one party in austria which realizes the real intentions of islam and they are going to win a couple of elections in the upcoming weeks . 
  austrian media tries to brainwash the population . 
  they basically show only children even though 80 % of the refugees are men . 
  they tell us what an enrichment these islamic refugees are for our country etc. 
  what really bugs me is that austria pays islamic teachers to teach at public schools . 
  those people transport the dangerous mindsets of this `` peaceful religion '' to all austrian muslims . 
  i 'm not saying all muslims are bad but a lot of them are so conservative and brainwashed and actually believe in a lot of concepts which are n't welcome in western societies . 
  our politicians will continue to preach that islam is such a peaceful religion . 
  and that 's actually the creepy part . 
  2000 $ ** per month ** just from social benefits is insane . 
  ah good . 
  i was not sure because alcohol/party related terms are often very regional . 
  80 minutes is not that long ... this guy or girl ( probably guy ) could have tanked a little bit before the event . 
  does one say `` vorgl\u00fchen '' as well in germany ? 
  otherwise it 'll be very expensive . 
   will boost the ** austrian ** and german economy . 
  98 % of them wo n't stay in austria . 
  approximately 150 of 300 people on the train had not the needed papers for the border crossing , said a spokesman of the border police . 
  really all of them ? 
  austrian news said those who had no official papers . 
  they have such high expectations how life is going to be in germany . . they must be disappointed there is no way that an overcrowded refugee shelter is going to meet their demands . 
  they probably think they are getting a house and a job in a leading position . 
  you have to know only one thing about the austrian government : it 's as lethargic as myself after drinking 7 beers in a short period of time . 
  i think i am going to visit my local train station toworrow ( linz ) just out of curiosity . 
  at the moment i 'm just sitting in front of my computer like most of us . 
  uhm . . sorry so many tabs that i ca n't even read english anymore . 
  i thought you want a translation from me . 
  so many things happening right now . 
  i learned norwegian for a couple of months when i realized that it 's basically danish . 
  i read danish newspapers quite often because it 's fun to read in foreign languages . 
  sorry . . yeah the quote i liked above was about how denmark tries to be unattractive for migrants . 
  i think they realized that it 's not helpful to advertise your own country for those amounts of migrants . 
  `` that denmark pursues a policy that wants the refugees to lose all hope , only when they hear the name denmark . '', 
  germany is exactly the opposite and they just pulled the panic border shut down trigger . 
  yeah you are right . 
  there are no alternatives . 
  breaking : austria is doing ... nothing . 
  they let them all come to austria . 
  the next days will be awesome . 
  better not buy a train ticket . 
  i have to say : our chancellor has to go . 
  he is incapable of anything . 
  unbelievable . 
  interesting read , thanks . 
  fortunately i understand danish quite well . 
  good for you guys . 
  germany is doing exactly the opposite . 
   seriously , though , what the hell is their problem ? 
  we do n't know it yet . 
  some refugees said they want to avoid austrian camps . 
  i guess most of them only know germany and it seems to be like a good circlejerk on reddit . 
  germany !, 
  germany !, 
  germany !, 
  it will be interesting what austria does next . 
  there are currently thousands of people entering our country . 
  * austrian police and helpers are getting nervous because of germany 's decision . 
  the good old times with closed borders . 
  i 'm not fond of this idea at all . 
  i do n't want to create artificial walls between our countries ever again . 
  there are still remnants of these slavic people in modern day germany : [ the sorbs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorbs ) . 
  bautzen = budy\u0161in in sorbian i really loved this [ documentary about them ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbdlsywg_v0 ) ( unfortunately only in german ) .
