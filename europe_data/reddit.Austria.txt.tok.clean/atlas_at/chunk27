  you always need some hate for a healthy sports rivalry . 
  football : i do n't think we have a rival because you always need two parties for a rivalry . 
  i ca n't tink of any country right now which considers us a rival . 
  skiing : switzerland . 
  this one is a real rivalry between the two greatest alpine skiing nations on earth . 
  usually we win , though . 
  it 's ok if you do n't like our dialects and our pronunciation of standard german . 
  that 's personal preference . 
  it 's true . 
  i do n't like various forms of german german . 
  but it 's not wrong and i do n't feel superior to germans . 
  we know the differences between german german and austrian german . 
  we do n't say that german german is wrong but we say that there are more options how to say something . 
  germans often say that everything else than the pronunciation of hannover is simply wrong . 
  that 's what i 'm criticising . 
  they often do behave like that when dealing with us . 
  they think they speak * the correct german . 
  the one and only version * and everything else is wrong . 
  what they do n't understand is that there is not one correct version of german . 
  german is a pluricentric language with a couple of equal standard languages and many dialects . 
  one german recently asked me if * i can speak normal * . 
  whatever that means . . 
  it seems that they look down on our language and feel superior . 
  of course not all germans are like that . 
  i 'm speaking mostly about the north germans but there are also many south germans who speak like coming fresh out of the prussian military academy and who think like that . 
  and what do you want to tell me with that anyway ? 
  do you think that i lie to you and that austrians want to join germany ? 
  i 'm the one who is living in austria and i know the people and what they think of germany . 
  i personally would rather join a former crown land ( czechia , hungary , slovenia , etc ) than germany . 
  those people probably exist but are just a small fraction of the fp\u00d6 . 
  that 's not their official position to the public . 
  and i think you speak of the presidential elections . 
  i 'm sorry to inform you that there were only two candidates in the run-off . 
  many of hofer 's voters would n't vote the fp\u00d6 in a normal election . 
   wanting austria to join is more serious than wanting to regain alsace . 
  you know that taylor swift song ?? 
  [ * we are never ever ever ever getting back together . 
  * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa4ix5d9z64 ) that 's what we think about this topic . 
  i do n't think there are any movements like that in austria . 
  i guess a lot of people are maybe a bit melancholic when talking about austria 's past . 
  even the right-wing nationalists from the fp\u00d6 are usually very careful when talking about such things publicly . 
  i know a fp\u00d6 politician though who once said in private to me that we should have * taken back * laibach when we had the chance after the breakdown of yugoslavia . 
  i 'd take one of our national symbols . 
  my choice would be : - [ the gro\u00dfglockner ( highest mountain of austria ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/grossglockner_and_pasterze_glacier.jpg/1920px-grossglockner_and_pasterze_glacier.jpg ) - [ the stephansdom in vienna ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/wien_-_stephansdom_%281%29.jpg ) i 'd also want to take important symbols of our states because those states play an important role in the identity of austrians . 
  for example : - [ goldenes dachl in innsbruck ( tyrol ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/innsbruck_goldenes_dachl_pc.jpg ) - [ uhrturm in graz ( styria ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/graz_i_innere_stadt_uhrturm_2.jpg ) - [ lindwurm in klagenfurt ( carinthia ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/43/klagenfurt_lindwurmbrunnen_2009.jpg ) persons ? 
  i could list a few but this often ends in a stupid discussion here on reddit so i wo n't . 
  it 's weird if you do n't use articles in front of names . 
  silly prussians ... 
  i 've visited all states of austria except for vorarlberg but you could argue anyway that this is n't even austria anymore . 
  obviously there are still many places which i have n't seen yet . 
  austria might be a small country but because of the diverse landscape of the alps there are a lot beautiful locations which i want to discover . 
  the problem is that you might lose the citizenship of your country of origin when you join a foreign military . 
  that 's how it works in austria and i suppose in other european countries as well . 
  [ the christmas speech from chancellor figl after the war in 1945 . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty8eoegqjqg ) translated into english he said : * i ca n't give you anything for christmas . 
  i ca n't give you candles for the christmas tree , if you even have one . 
  no piece of bread , no coal to heat , no new glass for your windows . 
  we do n't have anything . 
  i can only ask you to believe in this austria . 
   austria might make sense for someone already established in germany . 
  why ? 
   schnitzel is actually an italian dish uh . 
  you have been banned from / r/aeiou . 
  is n't that hungarian ? 
  i would n't dare to steal it from them . 
  [ schnitzi is love . 
  schnitzi is life . 
  and not with any kind of sauce . 
  i 'm looking at you dear germans . 
  thanks . 
  kristoffersen is a huge talent and still so young . 
  i 'm sure he 'll be world champion someday . 
  fun fact about him : he said to an austrian newspaper that he is more known in austria than in norway . 
  ski jumping is popular but alpine skiing is on the same level as football here . 
  the best austrian skier marcel hirscher is as famous as you can get in austria . 
  not really popular in austria . 
  we are more an alpine skiing country . 
  2015 was an extreme summer . 
  we had multiple heat waves where hot air from the sahara was transported to central europe . 
  i think it was the hottest summer after 2003 in the recorded history of austria . 
  that 's definitely not normal . 
  2015 we had a day with ~ 41 \u00b0 . 
  i wanted to die . 
  most austrians do not even have an air conditioning because we do n't really need it most of the time so i jumped into the car and drove around randomly with the ac on . 
  nice instant downvote . 
  i could do that as well but this is against the reddiquette . 
  you do n't downvote just because you disagree mr.joko . 
  all i said is that ethnic cleansing is bad . 
  does n't matter who it concerns and where . 
  apparently this is a bit of a touchy subject to confront you with such topics . 
   as they say you play stupid games , win stupid prizes . 
  that 's bs though . 
  make everyone pay because some fucked up . 
  should we have expelled the slovenian minority in carinthia as well in reaction to that ? 
  smh when people justify ethnic cleansing . 
   after the ww2 , we basically applied the collective guilt on them and deported all of them to germany . 
  several thousands were killed during the deportations , in some cases women and children too . 
  my grandpa 's reaction to this was something like `` it is horrible , but they can consider themselves lucky that it was just several thousands '' - and i think this can tell you something about the level of hatred that czech civilians felt towards germans at the end of the ww2 . 
  i hope that someday your country will confess its guilt in this expulsion . 
  it also took austria quite a long time ( early 90s ) to admit its nazi guilt .
