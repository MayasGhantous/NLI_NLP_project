  to be fair some sounds in danish are not easy to pronounce . 
  anyway , it should be an easy language for a german speaker . 
  many loanwords , close relation ( both germanics ) , etc. 
  i can read danish without problems and i have just learned norwegian for a couple of months this year . 
  i have been learning french for much longer and it still gives me a lot of troubles to read the newspaper . 
  well , i know it from the game gothic i. 
  the german band `` in extremo '' sang it there . 
  still one of my favourite games of all time . 
  i know a fascinating swedish folk song : [ herr mannelig ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwy6gmyggji ), 
  i think that 's exactly the plan . 
  it 's a terrible day the for the eu treaties ( which did n't work anyway ) but at least they will all move to germany . 
  let 's do this and stay `` hidden '' as long as we can . 
  what do you mean ? 
  a couple of years ago i helped out at the famous donaudampfschifffahrtsgesellschaft for a day . 
  yes they really exist . 
  we have a lot of east germans who work a couple of months here in the winter as waiters . 
  unfortunately i do n't know much more than that . 
  speaking of vienna and the rest of austria : yeah . . the more rural it gets the less immigrants you will see . 
  it 's definitely a little bit different . 
  but is n't this everywhere in europe ? 
   i do n't see any jobs in this photo tourists come to austria to go hiking , to ski , to ride a [ summer toboggan ] ( http://www.bad-mitterndorf.at/typo3temp/pics/b0693bce2c.jpg ) etc , etc , etc. 
  there are tons of jobs in the alps . 
   we try to make a profit out of this scenery . 
  last time i checked ( [ yesterday ] ( http://i.imgur.com/469v2rq.jpg ) ) it was still quite decent here . 
  the alps are also where they always used to be . 
  so theoretically they are able to work after 3 months ? 
  austria does n't grant asylum at all at the moment . 
  they suspended it temporarily . 
  and even if they do their job it certainly takes more than 3 - 15 months here . 
  i 've read something like after 3 months . 
  is that incorrect ? 
  anyway , they seem to have a special opinion about germany . 
  but i do n't think any austrian is mad about this . 
  in austria they are not allowed to work as asylum seekers . 
  that 's the difference . 
  would austria really send them to hungary ? 
  i think i 've read that our minister of interior once said that we do not send `` dublin cases '' back to hungary and greece . 
  i do n't think there is a need for that . 
  we 're quite happy how it all turned out . 
  on the other hand it 's not a secret that austria 's global political ideals are nearly identical with the german ones . 
  that 's why i wrote that they have to do this job due to their political and economical influence . 
  because nothing really happens in austria . 
  we concentrate a lot on internal politics which is n't of interest for anyone who is n't austrian . 
  therefore you wo n't hear much from us . 
  we even have a law student under 30 as foreign minister . 
  germany ( should ) make big world politics . 
  not austria . 
   whether good or bad , it symbolizes the peoples will to fight for their country and always stand up against bigger invading empires ( ottomans , ww1 , ww2 etc. 
  ) , no matter the odds . 
  you mean still nowadays ? 
  i would n't want to fight/die for my country . 
  i rather flee or deal with the oppression . 
  everything else is n't worth it . 
  what a shame though . 
  [ occitan is such a beautiful language . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rphlrrn9be ), 
  most definitely . 
   akureyri is iceland 's second city and located on the northern side of the country . 
  it is ** inhabited by superior beings who speak a higher form of icelandic ** . 
  why is that ? 
  i always thought that icelandic is pretty homogeneous . 
  actually the allies did n't allow it in 1919 . 
  and after ww2 ... well i guess it was better not to be german for so many reasons . 
  therefore stalin and the other allies let us off the hook very quickly . 
  damn germans . . 
  they stole our old anthem and claim the word `` deutsch/duits '' only for their country . 
  i guess there is nothing we can do against it . 
  yes , in austria it 's different . 
  is it really a synonym in germany ? 
  i guess this is because we have a `` casual '' right wing party and no real nazi party like the npd ( though some people inside the fp\u00d6 are exactly like the npd ) . 
  unprofessional subtitles : they always talk about `` rechts , rechte '' which simply means `` right wing '' . 
  in the beginning they translate it with `` nazi '' and later on with `` far right wing '' . 
  even though i think the npd is a nazi party that 's just not what the people said . 
  yeah and after that italaustria will be annexed by russia . 
   people just ca n't get their head around `` germans '' in italy . 
  you would n't have these kind of problems in austria . 
  i 'm just saying . . ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  [ vienna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzbisbatt14 ), 
  especially terrifying with putin 's rebel tactics . 
  it 's so easy for russia to cause death and destruction in a region without ever being accountable for anything . 
  it 'll be important to guard our eu borders very strictly unless we want russia 's `` freedom fighters '' to start another bloody war somewhere else . 
   never again it 's the same in austria . 
  especially when the russians occupied the czech republic in 1968 ( our military had to go to the border because they were not sure what the soviets were up to ) our mindset was that we never ever allow anyone to occupy us without any resistance again . 
  kaiserlich und k\u00f6niglich ( imperial/royal ) imperial -  austrian crown and royal -  hungarian crown, 
  not countries per se but still : south tyrol and bavaria . 
  after that i 'd definitely say the rest of the former k.u.k crew . 
  we central europeans are n't too different anyway . 
  i always realise that when i see folk music and traditions from our neighbors . 
  we drink beer anyway . 
  we do know jagertee though . 
  that 's tea with domestic rum . 
  a frenchman collects pictures of polar bears . 
  apparently most of them are from germany . 
  the polar bear was a famous attraction for photos in the 20th century in germany . 
  it seems that a lot of people wanted to take a picture with a bear . 
  der spiegel even writes from a polar bear hype . 
  nowadays this trend seems to be forgotten but not completely : in 2006 there was the birth of famous polar bear knut in berlin . 
  people went crazy but not only in germany . 
  but why was the polar bear so popular ? 
  there are just theories : the zoo of berlin had two polar bears in the 1920s .
