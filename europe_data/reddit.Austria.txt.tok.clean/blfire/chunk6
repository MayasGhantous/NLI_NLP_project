   all streaming music is free . 
  so all streaming of music is free ? 
  i do n't see the problem . 
  as long as they treat all the music platforms equally . 
  he his right . 
  they should shoot at everyone who hides their face at a demonstration with rubber bullets . 
  or paintballs or something how they can be identified later . 
   so if you are the only company providing a service what are you supposed to do ? 
  it 's unfair to punish a company for being good at what they do and then taking advantage of it . 
  if you walk into tesco and they put the tesco-brand products on special display would people be having the same reaction ? 
  than you get split up . 
  this is what happends if their is not a viable competitor in the market . 
  thats how you get monopolies ... 
    this punishment is a load of bullshit . 
  a search engine making money off affiliates ? 
  the horror !, 
  i assume they did n't marked it that way so that the consume knows it ... 
  they can also size all of their valuable things in the eu i assume . 
  and all of their patents in the eu . 
   i think they 're all fundamentally flawed and unqualified as a moral blueprint . 
  yes . 
  but there are better and worse blueprints . 
  religion is a set of belives and rules . 
  there are diffrent religions with diffrent set of blives and rules . 
  there are better set of blives and rules and worse ones . 
  there are good [ which are acceptable with western values ] religions and bad ones [ which ar n't acceptable with western values , freedom of speech , equality between genders , etc ] . 
  stop putting all religions in one buscket . 
  e. g. ahmadiyya muslims and sihks have set and belives ( religion ) which is better than the religion of the avverage person who practices islam . 
  maybe they consider themself european nationalists . 
  so is this anti muslim or anti dup ? 
  yeah . 
  americans have a completly diffrent understanding what the job of the first spouse / wife is than europeans . 
  in europe many people do n't care that much about the spouses of their leader . 
  hell , i am austrian and i have no idea what the name of the first lady ( is there even one ? ), 
  of our bp or prime minister is . 
  for real ? 
  is the muslim woman erdogans wife ? 
  i think it was funny . 
  how is this racist ? 
  i am not saying that those people are that way because of their race . 
  i say the opposite . 
  yes . 
  but people do n't talk about them if they talk about gipsys . 
  and there is no other word to describe people who does n't speak your countries language , begging , having a few babies on the arm ... . 
  or is there ? 
  if you go to another country where you do n't speak the language , stay infront of a supermarket with a baby on your arm and start approaching people in their language ( but extremly bad ) than you will be a culturial gipsy . 
  ( i would be alright with another word for a group of people who act that way . 
  but i do n't no another word ) if a ethnic gipsy went normal to scool and has a job and normal clothes / speak the language they are in than he would n't be a culturial gipsy anymore . 
  they might stand out . 
  but would you recognise them as gypsi ? 
  i think most people see gyspsi already as a way of live . 
  if you live a certain way than you can become a gypsi without beeing born one . 
  and if you do n't live that way anymore than you ar n't a gypsi anymore . 
  or is their a pc word for people who do n't speak their countries lanugage , stay within people with similiar lives , have many babies , often begg on the street , do n't value education that much , do n't have a regular legal work . 
  if those things above apply to you than you are a gypsi . 
  gypsis are kind of a culture / way of live already and not a ethnic i think . 
  i mean if you see a gypsi in normal clothes in a normal situation ( not begging on the street or somehting like that ) than you would n't know that he is a gypsi . 
  if you see an person who does n't speak your countries language , begging , having a few babies on the arm than you will think of them as gypsis . 
   batteries in general are poluting in their production and end life , but not when used obviously , while fuel cells are based on hidrogen which isnt poluting at all . 
  well yeah ofc there is some pollution if you produce batteries . 
  but is it really less for fuel cells . 
  do n't they need platinium and a high pressure tank ? 
  and every fuell cell vehicles have at least a 1 kwh battery . 
  yeah , but many people make the case that as long as the electricity grid is not 100 % renewables every new thing which increases the electricity demand has to use coal power . 
   fuel cells are even less poluting than lithium do you have any sources for this claim ? 
  because it is not common knowledge ... 
  why ? 
  why only frances macron ? 
  why not the fance before macron ? 
   finance the project with the american taxpayers money . 
  you feel pretty entitelt to others people money . 
   those cares have a massive energy demand which is satisfied with 86 % non renewable energy !, 
  ** how clean is a coal powerd electric car ? 
  ** ** facts ** * coal produces 820 gramm c02 per kwh * 5 % of electricity is lost in the grid . 
  * the hyundai ioniq electric consumes 15.7 kwh ( outlet to wheel ) per 100 kilometer * the most fuell efficient non-hybrid sedan , the madzda 6 consumes 3.1 gallon gasoline per 100 miles . 
  ( 32 mpg or 1.9375 gallons per 100 kilometer ) * one gallon gasoline produces 8.909 kilogram c02 * one gallon diesel produces 10.151 kilogramm c02 * a 84 miles electric car produces 1 ton more c02 at production than a comperable fossil fuel one . 
  ** calculations ** * how much c02 does ( does he ? ), 
  the hyundai ioniq safe per kilometer ? 
  * the hyundai ioniq produces 135.177 gramm ( 13.517 kg per 100 km ) co2 per kilometer if the electricity comes completely from coal power plants . 
  the most efficient non hybrid car produces 172.611 gramm ( 17.261 kg per 100 km ) co2 per kilometer . 
  a 40 mpg car produces 13.920 kg per 100 kilometer the hyundai ioniq produces 37.434 gramm co2 less than the mazda 6 . 
  this are 3.7434 kg co2 less per 100 kilometer than a madzda 6 . 
  this are 0,403 kg co2 less per 100 kilometer than a 40 mpg car . 
  * how much kilometer do you have to drive the hyundai ioniq to produce overall the same amount of co2 ? 
  * the hyundai ioniq has 125 miles of range . 
  this means that the hyundai ioniq produced 1,5 tons more co2 at production than a comperable fossil fuel car . 
  1,500 / 3.7434 * 100 = 40,070 kilometer . 
  1,500 / 0,403 * 100 = 372,208 kilometer . 
  ** conclusions ** if you drive an electric car , which gets the electricity exclusivly from a coal power plant , for 40,070 kilometers ( 25,043 miles ) than the electric car is as efficient as the most efficient non-hev fossil fuel sedan . 
  than the electric car is as efficient as a 32 mpg car . 
  if you drive an electric car , which gets the electricity exclusivly from a coal power plant , for 372,208 kilometers ( 232,630 miles ) than the electric car is as efficient as a 40 mpg car . 
  * note that a 40 mpg car would be a hev car which also needs additionally an electric motor and a 1-2 kwh battery . 
  * * note that co2 production of getting the oil -  gasoline to the the gas station was not accounted for while the 820 co2e gramm per kwh did account for everything .

  everytime i see dutch i think to myself `` why is this even considerd a foreign language '', 
   in denmark a ban has widespread support , and will.ne enacted with high probability . 
  timeframe when it might happen ? 
  inb4 offended americans would be more correct . 
  the fucked up thing is that it non medical circumsicion gets coverd by medicaid .
