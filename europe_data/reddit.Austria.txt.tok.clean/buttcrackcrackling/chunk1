that may well be . 
  with special offers we get stiegl goldbr\u00e4u for 70-80 cents per 0,5 l. 
  do you speak of the no-name-brands when you say `` leftovers '' ? 
  i know for a fact , that hofer sells ottakringer that is n't called ottakringer on the front of the can ... 
  that 's well in the higher-end-segment . 
  so you like wei\u00dfbier then  bavaria much ? 
  well , how are those priced ? 
  yeah , but you get ottakringer at hofer for about $ 0,5 . 
  that 's usually seen as an okay beer . 
  and from time to time they lower the prices for wieselburger to something similar . 
  and wieselburger is said to be pretty okay . 
  at the supermarket in austria : ca . 
  good beer starts around 0,7 . 
  peace , economic upswing , good times for the middle class , reforms in the education-sector . 
  but i have to admit , that my opinion might not be based on an overabundance of factual knowledge . 
  apart from the great-empire-thingy : i 'd say the 1970s . 
  i guess they were . 
  but long-distance was definitely more expensive than short-distance - something we 'd find crazy today . 
  i wonder , if they had a similar argue a few decades back ... * why should i pay that much for my short-distance calls , so they can make cheap long-distance calls ? 
  i do n't even use that service !, 
  some are , yes . 
  a : cutting europe up into smaller and perhaps culturally and ethnically more homogenuos pieces could spark nationalism and special interests and lead to a more divided union . 
  b : the existence of countries divides the union and is a cause for nationalism . 
  i assume , you are both against nationalism . 
  so i think you really do n't disagree that much and are just highlighting different parts of the issue ? 
  k\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz , never forget :'(, 
  i guess you are more or less right . 
  i 'll retreat to the following point : having `` a line '' does n't necessarily mean , that they are n't objective . 
  as far as i can tell , they do n't lie or try to manipulate people . 
  and no party has big influence on them . 
   der standard is not neutral . 
  it 's left wing i hear that a lot and do n't know why people keep saying that . 
  is it because they usually write bad things about the fp\u00d6 and the black 'n' blue coalition ? 
  being against the far right does n't make you less objective . 
  objectively the far right is bad . 
  and there is plenty of objective reasons to report on the misdoings of black-blue . 
  and it 's not like they do n't attack the sp\u00d6 - more now because they are part of the government . 
  so i guess that makes them seem biased ? 
  ps : of what antifa actions are you speaking ? 
  arguing that being neutral does n't necessarily mean that they have to be relativists and being objective does n't mean to portrait everyone and every opinion as equally good or bad , i 'll add [ der standard ] ( http://derstandard.at/ ) and [ profil ( investigative ) ] ( http://www.profil.at/ ) . 
  and * fingerspitzengef\u00fchl * is a real word that is actually commonly used , while i 've never heard * kreuzschlitzschraubenzieher * ( rather just * kreuzschraubenzieher * ) and * r [ ... ] gesetz * is the name of some law . 
  i guess , you see the anti-migration-stance as the position of realists ? 
  lyberakis argument about fortress europe and the danger of locking ourselves in , is in no way utopian . 
  ( at about 1:40 -1:44 ), 
  and i heard that the d\u00f6ner kebap was invented in germany by a turkish immigrant . 
  [ yeah , that might be it . 
  ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/flag_of_tunisia.svg ), 
  what 's that supposed to be ? 
  [ there just went 40 minutes ... sorry , in german , but with pictures . 
  i believe to remember that many austrian bridges have holes for explosive charges too . 
  but i think here the actual charges are stored somewhere else . 
  got any further information ? 
  [ are you sure ? 
  irrelevant , i think  the european court of justice considers students * workers * ( more or less ) in matter of article 45 tfeu ^ ( treaties of the functioning of the european union ) . 
  this article basically says that workers can move freely throughout the union . 
  therefore students can stay . 
  he probably wanted to depict his dictatorship as not totalitarian . 
  and i guess there are such not totalitarian dictatorships . 
  ( although nothing comes to mind now . ), 
  i looked up tegetthoff on wikipedia . 
  i do n't think his deeds are too relevant today . 
  i admit that of those five i only knew wittgenstein and kelsen . 
  wow , i did n't know !, 
  no hero material then . 
  i see downvotes , guess a few people did n't get the joke . 
  his username contains '' [ ilias ] '' ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iliad ) . 
  the scholl siblings stauffenberg, 
  [ he said in an interview that he 'd like a `` moderate dictatorship '' in austria and that he moved to swizerland for tax reasons . 
  ] ( http://www.kleinezeitung.at/sport/stratos/3152273/baumgartner-wuerden-gemaessigte-diktatur-brauchen.story ) ( i 'm sorry , link 's only german . ), 
  i would n't consider felix baumgartner a hero - the dumb things he said make him someone i could n't look up to . 
  not so heroic as well : bruno kreisky ( conservatives wo n't agree here ) karl popper anton zeilinger ( teleportation ftw ! ), 
  i guess that 's partly the point ... to make it more counterfeit-proof . 
   rich parts would include entire continents do n't we have growing poverty rates in the us and in the eu , while wealth is growing but concentrating more and more today ? 
  if yes , then to get there , we 'd have to change things a bit . 
  you wan na be one of those lizzard-people ... obviously !, 
  it 's only gay , if you do n't close your eyes !, 
  i do n't believe , you really are from antarctica : /, 
  * what ?? 
  you are joking , right ? 
  quote : '' * deportation * '', 
  if david bowie had commented on china 's moonlanding , would think it belonged in / r/europe as well ? 
  how does that belong in / r/europe ? 
  are you from the republic of three chicken walk into a bar ... ? 
  the * bauernbund * ( ~ * league of farmers * ) is a very powerful subsidiary organisation of the \u00d6vp . 
   more a pr person that is what i think of him . 
  [ the term wunderkind ( from german : `` wonder child '' ) is sometimes used as a synonym for prodigy ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/child_prodigy ), 
  horray, 
  nice drawings : 10 nice musik : 9 friendly voice : 10 actual content : 0, 
  i could n't imagine that , but it is at least an `` ag '' . 
  why ? 
  yes, 
  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/marshall_plan#leistungen_aus_dem_marshallplan germany got about 1/10 of it according the link . 
  but they ( the k&k - monarchy ) had almost no colonies at all . 
  in case you are calling hungary a colony , owned by the german lands of austria : i would call that a regular expansion at the utmost or a province rather than a colony . 
  so what do you mean ? 
  1 ) because it is relevant . 
  turkey even touches the eu ; they are a direct neighbour . 
  2 ) the map is not about geotectonics . 
  it is about purchasing power . 
  also ( but without sarcasm ) : thanks , marshall plan .
