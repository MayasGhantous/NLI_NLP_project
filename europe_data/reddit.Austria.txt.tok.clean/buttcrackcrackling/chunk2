  you are right : the video looks nice . 
  and thx for the little backround information , 
  they try to make everything more emotional with that dramatic music . 
  i do n't like that in a video that is supposed to inform . 
  never  :-), 
  also : `` if you 're cut '' not `` if your cut '', 
  not wrong , i fear : / that is why i wrote the '' ( in a way ) '' ... 
  well , are n't the stronger ones paying now ? 
  ( in a way ), 
  right  and yellow is more or less the german confederation except austria and prussia ? 
  i must admit that this is not at all my field of expertise , but i believe hungary was under habsburg control during the time of interest and just part of their empire without too much of sovereignty ( until 1867 ) . 
  therefore i would n't distinguish here if i had to draw a simple map . 
  is the turquoise land that touches russia supposed to be hungary ? 
  longer , but not far longer : until the creation of the austrian empire in 1804 the habsburg monarchy was not an empire , but rather just separate lands owned by the same house ( or person ) ; nothing to draw on a map . 
  only their german lands ( ie much of today 's austria ) were part of the holy roman empire ( which ceased to exist in 1806 ) . 
  are you speaking of the austerity measures ? 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  `` once again '' - you make it sound as if sweden was notoriously fighting freedom just for the fun of it . 
  i read the text in fast-forward so i might have missed something : this seems to be a text of someone saying that philosophy is a lot to learn , that it could be indoctrination and that opinions of other people can be bad for you , so you should n't listen to them ... or should ... she is not sure ... 
  a ) yes , it is * partly * . 
  b ) it shares direct borders with the union itself . 
  c ) there have been diplomatic talks about joining the union . 
  ( no matter how unrealistic that may or may not be . ), 
  d ) i think you are not the brightest , considering you seem to call the turks europeans yourself  ( `` no other european ... '' ), 
  5:45 guy jacking his firing mg around and aiming only * slightly * above the metal hand rail at some point . 
  he could shoot himself indirectly doing that , could n't he ? 
  who downvoted here , and why ? 
  i think he 's right : if tourists spend foreign money in your country that 's also viewed as exports . 
  i just wanted to highlight two things i very much agree with   * convenient to use english  * formalising somehow as one step above the others makes me uncomfortable, 
   what people did to latin i too thought of latin in the middle ages . 
  but that 's not necessarily bad : it makes it easier to learn . 
  plus you would still have your mothertongue for more subtle communication . 
  also this subreddit is only using english . 
  i can neither speak catalan nor can i speak spanish and i assume that you do n't speak german . 
  so without such an already simplified common tongue ( that at least i am not able to use in all its intricacies ) , i could never have answered you here . 
  the uk does ** not ** have high quality water imho . 
  i remember water tasting like chlorine . 
  ( that was in and around oxford . ), 
  so , how does it fight forgery ? 
  because banks look more closely ? 
  alright , accepted . 
  but the old ones wo n't be used anymore then ? 
  because otherwise it would n't harm the forgery business , would it ? 
  i like his acting . 
  perhaps the half_wit meant that kinsky could be ... well ... difficult . 
  i might have missed something : why do we get new designs ? 
  thanks for drawing the picture  all right , i accept it , if we claim that he did it because of fairness and moral and not because of political gain . 
  ( again : i do n't know him ), 
  what direction ? 
  towards cutting wages in general or towards cutting high-level-wages ? 
  ( i must admit that i know next to nothing about finish politics , but the other comments suggest that he is not * one for the small man * ), 
  * a nice gesture * , one could say . 
  but it 's just that : * a gesture * . 
  it has no real impact if you cut politicians ' wages , i do n't believe it helps the country 's budget . 
  i am against that kind of populism . 
  i dond ' t know what it was exactly . 
  :d nahh , mainly energy and stuff , i think . 
  i know someone who worked for some `` scientific '' institute . 
  this institute has an unscientifically clear view of the world and just produces masses of papers . 
  he said , their papers are built like that : * introduction : what is it about ? 
  * main body : pages and pages of sometimes unscientific , illogical or plainly untrue bs . 
  * conclusion : outcome in line with the institute 's ideology . 
  and if anybody wants to know if opinion a or b is right and there are 100 papers saying a and 200 saying b , they wo n't read them all , but rather just look at the conclusions and number of papers published . 
  yes i did . 
  he used those tiny ** ' ** . 
  that indicates that those statements do n't necessarily have to express his own opinion . 
  i guess he wanted to show , that there are different types of comments you might not agree with , yet among them there are comments ( the one about breivik ) you can not even accept as a topic of discussion . 
  fair enough, 
  * hating cultures * has become a disguise for racism . 
  however i too do believe , one can disagree with cultural characteristics . 
  but as you sound ( arrogant and aggressive in these posts ) you do seem racist . 
  there is that great satire show [ `` die 4 da '' ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/die_4_da ) where they show fictional software for a racist newspaper : if you type * `` wretched , dirty ass-nigga '' * the software changes it to * `` black african asylum seeker '' * ; but the reader gets the message nonetheless . 
  now stop with all the hating and raging . 
  you can not enforce liberalism and wo n't spread any european ideals like that , 
  that is not the topic of discussion here . 
  the fucking culture of the fucking subreddit is *** fucking r/europe !, 
  *** so even if we have a history of censorship on this continent , we sure ca n't tolerate it nowadays . 
  very true : i was just trying to think of reasons for not liking people , so i could post it here :d, 
  i want everybody to have access to quality food , because that 's a matter of health . 
  btw just think of children of poor parents . 
  do you want to be less healthy because your single mom has a badly paid job ? 
   pocket money to buy a tv no . 
  i did not propose such a thing . 
  that was just my answer to your statement that you did n't want to have the people buy more food , but rather washing machines , if having more money at hands . 
  i then tried to explain , that they would either not buy significantly more food , or if they did , they should most likely have gotten it anyway because it was really needed . 
  many people hate their jobs . 
  if people were n't forced to do them , perhaps they would improve ; because work force would still be needed . 
  if you retire with 50-55 years you 'll be getting your money from people working then - for maybe 30 years ... after working for circa 30 years ? 
  how is that system better ? 
  i wonder how many people would behave like you say you would . 
  we 'd have to try it somewhere . 
  of course , if everybody did so ... well ... collapse, 
   if i pay 40 % while the other guy pays 10 % , then it 's not fair . 
  but you said you 'd value a broad middle class . 
   if they could afford a big tv ( over 500 eur ? ), 
  then they would be middle class . 
  that 's almost my point . 
  and if they are so poor , that they must invest any additional money into food , i need you to agree , that they should get the necessary help . 
  ( or else i 'll say , you 'd let them starve in your washing machine  ), 
   here i pay as much tax as everyone else no , you do pay more , if you earn more .
