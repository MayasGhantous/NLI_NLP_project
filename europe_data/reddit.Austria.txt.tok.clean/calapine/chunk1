if putin wants to cause trouble he will do that , wether we give him a pretext or not ... 
  this is obviously intended for children ...

  more than enough there to last for some time reading . 
  i am getting all misty-eyed . 
  upvoted !, 
  very d'awwwwwwwwwwww, 
  windows 8.1 in the past (  10 years ) i tried suse linux and os/2 2.1 i 'd like to switch away from windows to preferably linux , but as i use the pc for mainly gaming this does n't seem practical yet . 
  this might be of interest for you : [ status of non-eu nationals who are long-term residents ] ( http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l23034_en.htm ), 
  bad idea . 
  i have seen this film : you create a portal between dimensions to allow ftl travel , but it actually opens up a portal to hell ~ ~ russia ~ ~ . 
  please do n't post links to fox news here . 
  interesting . 
  do you have a link to the source webpage/pdf ? 
  i am honestly not too sure whether uk staying in the eu is in the end more positive or negative for the eu . 
  totally . 
  i would n't bomb * anyone * for only 25,000 usd . 
  fifa sucks . 
  a majority are against sunday opening hours here , and it 's not due religions reasons . 
  people should n't have to work on sundays . 
  eek your name . 
  that 's not nice giving that mental image to your fellow posters . 
  to use that example : we are n't putting every toddler under the knife and remove their non-inflamed appendixes without medical indication . 
  have you never wondered what your car seats are made off ? 
   you are telling me not one person would vote for `` should be banned outright . '' ? 
  not one person ? 
  if you keep asking people of course you might get one that actually says that . 
  the same way you 'll encounter a jehova 's witness who wont allow blood transfusion even if it 's life saving . 
  but that are retarded freak opinions and not worth engaging with . 
  you are making up a strawman . 
  i would n't call it a showstopper , but i think it looks weird . 
  definitely prefer men * au naturel . 
  what why ? 
  funds for the eu are well spent : regional fonds , infrastructure , research & development , etc. . . what would be needed is an independent funding source . 
  a financial transaction tax which pays into the eu budget , for a example . 
  they are not playing a games . 
  those are changes in how the contribution is calculated . 
  these were agreed in 2007 , by all states including the uk , and come into effect now . 
  it 's not a reaction to the uk econmic development , like the british papers claim . 
  it 's only been released today . 
  i am sure it will gather millions views , because ~ ~ people care about space exploration ~ ~ littlefinger . 
  ca n't we just ignore that cunt , * please ? 
  eh , according to your flag you are an european too . 
  this seems kind of important . 
  are there an pixel-experts on / r/europe ? 
  they claim it 's false . 
  see tweet from 2 hours ago : https://twitter.com/israelinireland, 
  embassy claims on it 's twitter page that the tweet is from a fake account . 
   the tweet purportedly from this account appearing on boards.ie & condemning the irish government is entirely false and comes from a fake a/c https://twitter.com/israelinireland, 
  20 % would be 4 $ on a 20 $ meal . 
  that 's very generous imho . 
  personally for small amounts , say a single coffee , i tend to round to the next euro . 
  so cappuccino 3,40  4 $ . 
  for bigger meals up to 10 % , but at least 1 $ , even if the service was just so-so . 
  otho tourists are usually more giving , there would be nothing wrong with following the 20 % route . 
  much more would be a bit pretentious maybe . 
  ** first officer : ** let 's ask for directions , misha . 
  ** captain : ** shuttup , i know where we are !, 
  [ conversation obviously in russian ], 
  i think that one was sarcasm . 
  it 's hard to tell sometimes though ... ** edit : ** if it makes you feel better , not everyone wants albanians to be annihilated from the face of the earth . 
  i personally think isolation in camps is absolutely adequate !, 
  yes , this . 
  do you think this will push cameron even more into a tougher stance towards the eu in an attempt to woe europesceptic voters ? 
  not that dschughaschwili guy ? 
  hitler was n't a politician of/in austria !, 
  my preliminary diagnosis is this is of problem with vater and penis . 
  i suppose the spanish media is reporting in more detail than the international ones . 
  have there be any suggestions already to what went wrong in this case ? 
  ot : i love your username !, 
  well , statements like :  britons must accept a greater loss of digital freedoms in return for greater safety from serious criminals and terrorists in the internet age , according to the country 's top law enforcement officer . 
  are pretty worrying . 
  but i fear here on / r/europe saying that would just be preaching to the chore . 
  and the people pushing those policies on the hand do n't care about my opinion anyway . 
  so what is there to say ? 
  i agree with the title `` poland matters '' and think it will become more important within the eu in future . 
  but the article itself is n't very good . 
  it lists anecdotes such as * `` poles broke the enigma code '' * and platiudes like * `` many if not most people will say that their country has great people , but the poles can say this with confidence '' * . 
  what does that even mean ? 
  or have any relevance for today ? 
  later the author compares the french unfavorable to the poles , again relying on cliches : * the average polish person loves free enterprise in a way that the average french person does n't i am sad to admit . 
  * but it has been sold a lie by its political establishment that government can take the rough edges off of life , and provide risk-free security * france is a good place to go shopping . 
  but give me a polish man or woman to back with my money any day of my life . 
  * france [ ... ] being essentially bankrupt . 
  essentially bankrupt ... * really ? 
  * overall just another content-less opinion piece by a us right-wing journalist . 
  i doubt the author really cares about poland here but just uses it as cudgel to whack france with . 
  good for him . 
  i hope other politicians see this and take heart . 
  * ^ says ^ someone ^ who ^ only ^ speaks ^ two ^ languages . 
  * sounds catchy actually ... 
  can you give a short recap/summary , please ? 
  i am really curious ... 
   horrifying that 's the word . 
  what scares me the most is not even the intelligence services overstepping their mandate , it 's that we already know there will be no consequences . 
  they do whatever they want , and if they get caught they still get away with it . 
  how can that end well for democracy ? 
  that 's not a `` how to piss of a turk '' but a `` how to get shived by a turk '' joke !, 
  o.o * upvoted !, 
  spain spends less on the army than slovakia ?
