  easy : everyone country has the button , but the nukes only launch if a qualified majority presses it !, 
   they should man the ship exclusively with sailors from luxembourg , ** austria ** , the czech republic , slovenia and slovakia . 
  our navy performed rather well in wars !, 
  and we could offer a perfect name : ** donau ** ( danube ) 1 . 
  river - not a person , so no historical baggage . 
  flows through romania , hungary , austria , germany , bulgaria , slovakia , moldavia and ukraine - thus very inclusive and appealing to many countries . 
  if the next ship is named with something fitting west/nordic europe than no one is left out . 
   huh . 
  i just copied the link a friend of mine posted . 
  i guess you friends do n't really like you , sorry ... 
  april april :(, 
  the point is it was warm before  we went from +18 \u00b0 c to snow in two days . 
  which leads to the sayings : * april , april der macht was er will . 
  * april , april it does whatever it wants . 
  like everything it 's true because it rhymes . 
  awww :(, 
  oettinger is such a failure . 
  in case someone wants to know how the airspace looked before europe got fabed up : [ imgur ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ztcf2gw.png ), 
  be honest , are you trying to do a [ treaty of tordesillas ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_tordesillas ) again ? 
   fabce : fab central europe  fabec : fab europe central very original naming there . 
  and not confusing at all either !, 
   you seem to have some extensive knowledge on the subject , so could you explain this [ 1 ] ? 
  apparantly under ` alternate law ' it says that bank angle protection is retained while in alt1 , although the same does n't go for alt2 . 
  you seem to be right about the bank angle , even though this boeing pilot was n't exactly wrong : it 's like the link says . 
  strictly speaking there is n't one ` alternate law ' but various levels ( alt1 , alt2 ) , depending on fail states . 
  there also is another variant called ` abnormal attitude alternate law ' which triggers - as the name suggests - if the plane goes far beyond normal conditions . 
  such as a bank angle greater than 125 \u00b0 or more than 50 \u00b0 nose up . 
  the idea behind this is a scenario like an mid air collision . 
  the result is similar to the other alternate laws , in that most protections are deactivated . 
  it 's basically the computer telling the pilot : * `` this is an emergency , i am pulling out all the stops . 
  you have full access to whatever the control surfaces can provide/whatever the aircraft frame can sustain . 
  do what you need to do . 
  '' * that 's about the broad gist of it and applies to all airbus since the a320 . 
  there are some minor variations between the different plane types , but this are details which i am not really knowledgeable about . 
   the airbus autopilot would normally stop the bank angle automatically at 30 degrees . 
  not correct . 
  bank angle protection kicks in at 67 degree , not 30 . 
  additionally if the pilot really wanted to go beyond this he can bring the plane into ` alternate law ' ( for example by turning off 2 adirus ) , thus deactivating the flight envelope protection . 
  not that there ever is any reason to ever roll a passenger jet ` upside down ' . 
  well , that sucks . 
  i remember that one mod ( forgot his name , i think he had german flair ) resigned his post because he was n't happy with the way moderation/censorship was handled in this subreddit . 
  a bit more transparency certainly would be a good thing . 
  why was that removed ... ? 
   a pretty improbable one at that . 
  exactly . 
  i expect them to fold once the time to vote comes :(, 
  yes , but some of his points ( `` its pronunciation is unclear '' ) are even truer for french . 
  i suggest german as official eu language . 
  judging by this map south tirol and the triest region look like they are part of austria . 
  * hmmm ... *, 
   not really , austrians are germans with an accent . 
  you are not making any new friends here with statements like that ... 
  if we are measuring by time spent playing my answer is wow and eve . 
  does anyone know why austria is so high up there ? 
  supposedly one of our national characteristics is always complaining , so answering yes to the question `` are you satisfied '' seems strange ... 
  i guess that depends on the country . 
  for a german parliamentarian any investigation or arrest requires the consent of the bundestag . 
  only exception is arrest while being caught in the act of a crime . 
  for the worlsnews ? 
  i know it has a bad reputation , but do you know any other subreddits with a worls-newsy focus ? 
  ( serious question ) edit : worl ** d ** news . 
  i blame the spelling mistakes on my mobile phone . 
  ( no , * really * , the layout slightly changes when switching between en and de and . . it 's not my fault . ), 
  it 's not a civil war . 
  it 's a astroturf `` uprising '' that was started and now is held alive by russia . 
  austrian politicians do n't want to piss of russia ( it 's bad for business ) , but neither would they openly oppose germany ( it 's bad for business ) . 
  so while we might drag our feet on sanctions there wo n't be any veto against them either . 
  impressive . 
  unfortunately it seems the german and austrian pirate parties rather choose to self destruct :(, 
  you know that 's not true , right ? 
  / u/surfingtubes account created an hour ago . 
  sockpuppet much ? 
   i think they are unregulated , unsupervised and can do whatever they want . 
  stop lying . 
  the german child care services are n't any different than those in other european countries . 
   john r. schindler , a former national security agency official well , of course he does n't like the idea of an independent european army . . 
  look at the make-up of switzerland . 
  nowadays there is no real reason to centralize ministries/institutions within a single city . 
   maybe towards the east , vienna could be an option in the future . 
  ftfy , 
  uh , make up sex ? 
  i have no clue really ... 
  oh , i did n't blame anyone , it was more a general observation . 
  taking big historic developments and trying to pin the blame/responsibility on single individuals ( or on a single cause ) is a fools errand anyway . 
  that 's the sad thing . 
  after ukraine i think russia is the country that 's harmed most by putin 's politics in the long run . 
  at least it seems they were n't the last ones . 
  from the article :  over the years , the area has yielded thousands of dinosaur eggs from the upper cretaceous period . 
  but yeah . 
  65 ** million ** years and it only takes some douchbags ... 
  understandable . 
   although in hindsight i guess it would have been better ( = more stable , fairer ) if everyone got the deal the magyars did at that point . 
  not merely austria-hungary but austria-hungary-chezchia-slovakia-slovenia-croatia-etcetc ... and then 50-100 years later either peaceful separation or a democratic federal state with a figurehead monarch . 
  you are right of course . 
  but mothers die one day and one hardly ever ends up thinking `` i wish i had n't spent so much time with them ! '', 
  speaking from experience ... 
  * anyway !, 
  * putin . 
  my guess is a simple flue ( or similar ) and putin 's macho-tough-ruler image simply does n't allow them to admit a weak side . 
  ( imho it would just humanize him , thus help with popularity , but i am not a russian ) he 'll be back .
