  and the poster who said / r/europe starts to be like like us-republicans that ca n't stop talking about obama is right . 
  a bit emberassing . 
  sure . 
  maybe together with a young , good looking and innocent [ empress ] ( http://i.imgur.com/unsmcvy.jpg ) ? 
  i think sisi ii would be a total pr-coup in today 's boulevard-media/internet gossip world ... 
  will you come back any-time soon ? 
  it 's not fun being a minor sized nation . 
  think about what would be achievable if we joined forces ... possible campaign slogans : * better together !, 
  ^ ^ tm * reverse trianon !, 
  * puppy eyes *, 
  but it was just a suggestion anyway . 
  * shuffles off *, 
  it 's an achievement , but i think it 's one step too far . 
   why do n't you just e-mail mail/sms/instant-messenger-of - choice your mother now and tell her you love her . 
  just because !, 
  please calm down . 
  during most of the cold war we have been closer to apocalypse then now . 
  it 's going to be fine . 
  just have an ovomaltine and enjoy . 
  in austria it 's `` erd\u00e4pfel '' actually . 
  literally translates as ` earth apples ', 
  i think the pregnant girlfriend is the most likely issue . 
  i mean who would try to coup away putin and for what reason ? 
  let alone think they could get away with it ... 
  i do n't know , 4chan was pretty well informed on that ` celebrity nudes ' event ... 
  who told you ? 
  you have the right to abort your stupid posts !, 
  ^ just ^ teasing !, 
   so much passion ... ... worthy of a better cause . 
  if the bus is 30 years old ( and it looks older than that ) this would require only ~ 58000 km per year . 
  not much for a public transport vehicle . 
   german diplomatic cables and thousands of pages of leaked classified eu documents reveal behind-the-scenes efforts by governments to weaken the eu 's data protection bill . 
   lobbyplag.eu , which obtained the cables and documents , on tuesday ( 10 march ) , found that 132 of 151 ( 87 % ) changes by member states lowered privacy protections . 
   they say 40 ( 26 % ) are even lower than the current 1995 rules that the bill is supposed to update and replace . 
   only 19 ( 13 % ) are said to improve protection standards . 
  many of those were tabled by hungary , austria , and greece . 
   despite its public statements on the need for strong data protection , germany is shown to be leading the pack of member states seeking more business-friendly standards throughout the whole of europe . 
   out of 73 amendments proposed by berlin , only 11 are pro-privacy . 
  the uk comes in second for having tabled 49 anti-privacy amendments , followed by ireland ( 33 ) and the czech republic ( 28 ) . 
  thanks germany !, 
  ^ ( and ^ uk ^ and ^ ireland ^ and ^ czechia ) / ^ s this sounds similar as to the net neutrality debate . 
  parliament passes a strong law , the council tries to weaken it . 
  i am starting to think the eu would be perfect if we kicked out all the countries . 
   something definately went wrong in my life :( no point fretting about the past , just work to make your future better . 
  ie : do not watch episode 19 !, 
   and rightfully so , people are not watching movies because they want to learn something about the actual stuff in countries but , but ... i do !, 
  german wiki says he fought against the hungarians ( and thus on our side ) when they started the anti-habsburg revolution in 1948 . 
  the man deserves his coin !, 
  is there a historic reason ( like for the uk ) why the netherlands are so us focused ? 
  now he can do his damage europe-wide . 
  thanks !, 
  true , but who who is commissioner makes a difference as well . 
  compare the terms of neelie kroes as competition commissioner ( microsoft 497 bn fine ) to the much more tame joaqu\u00edn almunia . 
  or the digital agenda portfolio between , again , neelie kroes and now oettinger . 
  oettinger is absolutely the wrong person for this job . 
  swedish - isis relationships are on an all time low as well . 
  not long and sweden will stand internationally isolated !, 
   incompetent police sirens . 
   annoying and innefective uhh ... . oooook ? 
   he was very much for palestine getting independent and israel wanted to call him and antisemite , but could n't . 
  actually they could and did . 
  just google `` kreisky jewish antisemite '' for some examples . 
  the milder charge was self-hating jew . 
  agnostic jew , i think that 's even more special , 
  i like the idea , but needs more countries . 
  austria , romania , france , italy , etc. . . mafia & eastern european organized crime , too good a topic to miss out .

   clearly i 'm not up to speed with developments in my hometown ... 
  i am currently attending a photo and a line dance course . 
  maybe that 's what they refer to with `` creative scene '' ? 
  the artist behind the score is pretty good as well - if one likes synthwave ;-) his soundcloud page : https://soundcloud.com/hubrid-sound/, 
   timelapse movie following the preparations of the exomars 2016 spacecraft in the lead up to launch on 14 march 2016 . 
  the movie includes the integration of the entry , descent and landing demonstrator module , schiaparelli , with the trace gas orbiter , and the journey of the spacecraft inside the proton rocket as it is moved to the launch pad and raised to a vertical position . 
   exomars launched from baikonur , kazakhstan at 09:31 gmt on 14 march . 
  it will arrive at the red planet on 19 october . 
  its mission is to address unsolved mysteries of the planet 's atmosphere that could indicate present-day geological -- or even biological -- activity , and to demonstrate the landing technologies needed for future missions to mars . 
  shame this is getting downvoted . 
  the esa `` earth from space '' series is generally pretty interesting . 
  works with reddit upvotes too !, 
  ^ or ^ so ^ i ^ have ^ heard ... 
  aside from the fact that he wont get out as / u/augustus290 points out , the reason for only 14 years is that juvenile law applies for him , which has a maximum sentence of 15 years for murder . 
  because due this age at the time of the crime he still fell into the category `` juvenile law '' in which 15 years is the maximum for murder . 
  uk brexiting and scotland leaving uk and then ( re ) - joining the eu might not be such a bad outcome ... 
  can i get an pm please ? 
  the cost of printing is nothing in the grand scheme of things for europe and definitely not a worthy reason to give up the banknotes . 
  you obviously did n't read the article . 
  but where are you from ? 
  is * anyone * still playing their taxes ? 
   would you consider kazakhstan european ? 
  we need a form for this : + + + breaking news + + + russia opposed to : ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 
  is there such a thing as peak-lego ? 
  ** til : ** there is an eu project called [ ec-safemobil ] ( http://www.ec-safemobil-project.eu/ ) for development of uavs . 
  this prototype is one of the developments that are supported by the project . 
  the safemobil consortium includes the universities of zagreb , seville and duisburg . 
  true european collaboration !, 
   an uncrewed , electric , autonomous aircraft travelling at 75 kilometres per hour lands gently on the roof of a moving car . 
    for the first time , researchers at the german aerospace center ( deutsches zentrum f\u00fcr luft - und raumfahrt ; dlr ) have successfully demonstrated a technique developed for this purpose . 
  the system could be applied to ultralight solar-powered aircraft that complement conventional satellite systems while flying in the stratosphere . 
    eliminating the landing gear significantly increases the payload capability of a solar-powered aircraft -- it is easier to land during crosswind conditions , making landings in unfavourable weather conditions possible .
