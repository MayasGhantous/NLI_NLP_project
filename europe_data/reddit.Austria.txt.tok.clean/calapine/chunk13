  i do n't agree either , but it 's a perfectly valid opinion to hold . 
   what a whiny little bitch . 
  but he tried to mop up the water !, 
  what a well behaved rock `` star ! '', 
  holy . 
  it 's like they are deathtraps . 
  :( there is a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oozfq9egxeo ) of the station club fire from the inside . 
  one minute after the first flames the club was already filled with smoke , coming out of the windows and front door . 
  that sounds exactly like the [ station club nightfire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_station_nightclub_fire ) . 
  i guess more like ard or bbc . 
  i guess more like ard or bbc . 
  the video of the comment is worth watching for the bush - rubio exchange alone . 
  bush got trashed , it 's getting pretty clear that he wo n't be the republican candidate in 2016 . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9u5_kfd5sq, 
  what are you searching for ? 
  i am just trying it and the results are pretty much the same as google gives me ... 
  site : seems to work at least ... https://www.qwant.com/?q=site:reddit.com%20countvontroll&amp;t=all ** edit : ** what i am missing though are ways toggle search results up to a certain date and in a specific language . 
   we kinda flew too close to the flame with meciar that 's wonderfully poetic . 
  the important part :  shields singled out `` an alarming movement towards end-to-end encrypted application '' for criticism . 
  she said that david cameron `` expressed concern that many companies are building end-to-end encrypted applications and services and not retaining the keys . 
  the prime minister has repeatedly said that there can not be a safe place for terrorists , criminals and paedophiles to operate freely , with impunity and beyond the reach of law . '', 
  for this reason , she claimed , `` it is absolutely essential that these companies which understand and build those stacks of technology are able to decrypt that information and provide it to law enforcement in extremis . '', 
  screw them . 
  spot on . 
  i really do n't understand what 's going on in merkels head regarding this issue . 
  esa or rather it 's new director w\u00f6rner thinks differently . 
  i hope his plans for an international moon base , including the chinese and india , takes off . 
  space exploration needs to stop being a dick waving context . 
  the reason the eurofighter exists is because having six national fighter programmes in europe would be stupid , not because the uk or germany were n't advanced enough to make their own . 
  pretty nationalistic bait article . 
  but why is slovakia so different then ? 
   is there no website that offers comparisons ? 
  yes , but there just are n't any good offers . 
  to make sure i am not telling bullshit i quickly researched options for my address : * [ 30 mbit up / 6 down ] ( https://i.imgur.com/7o3i1ux.png ) for $ 32,80 - my current one ( $ 35 was from memory , sorry ) * [ 100 mibit up / 10 down ] ( https://i.imgur.com/2eapvqb.png ) for $ 39,90 - the best offer . 
  would get if it was n't for the hassle to have cable routed to my flat * [ 20 mbit up / 1 mbit ] ( https://i.imgur.com/ffdz3mh.png ) down for $ 24,90 - not competive * and then there are a couple in the range of < 16 mbit , which is just too slow for me . 
  and that is in linz , pop 200k , the 3rd largest city in austria . 
  it 's really quite sad . 
   iirc there are about 13 isp 's that offer service to my address on fiber alone , then there 's cable and vdsl2 . 
  would you take me in ? 
  i can cook , clean and much more !, 
  it 's nice to have some happy-feel-good news again once in a while . 
  even if it 's only garbage . 
  not aware of any better offers really . 
  internet over cable tv line would be 39,90 for 100 mbit , but my current flat does n't have cable . 
  when i am moving ( soon ) i am going to shop around again, 
  well , fuck you !, 
  i am paying $ 35 for 30 mbit . . 
  look here : http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-european-single-market-for-electronic-communications-draft-legislative-resolution-proposal-to-reject.html, 
  i just took a look at [ votewatch ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-european-single-market-for-electronic-communications-draft-legislative-resolution-proposal-to-reject.html ) to see how our austrian parliamentarians acted . 
  only the greens ( 3 people ! ), 
  voted for changes to improve the law . 
  the rest \u00d6vp , the supposedly `` left '' sp\u00d6 , neos , fp\u00d6 all voted for the law as it passed today . 
  so depressing . 
  we can only hope . 
  netzpolitik.org wrote that a vodafone representative spoke of ` high quality video ' as special service . 
  that would be fucked up . 
  germany ? 
  ;-) more seriously , i guess norway . 
  i heard they are rich ... 
  * nod * i suppose the current immigration issues did n't help the incumbents either . 
  off topic : are you skywalkerpl on wikipedia by chance ... ? 
  pis is usually described as hostile to the eu in our media , so i can see how their election victory can been seen as a rebuff of.the rest of europe . 
  * pats * i upvoted you . 
  horses are tasty . 
  that sounds a lot like europe as well . 
  i mean , when was the last time the eu was n't in a crisis ? 
  that 's a lot of pis ... 
  i know this is not going to happen but ... merging the uk + french nuclear arsenal into an `` european strategic force '' with a strong deterrence-only , no-first-strike policy would save a lot of money and probably make europe stronger as a political actor on the world-stage at the same time . 
   uk created www after the americans invented the actual internet . 
  more exact would be to say by an english ( tim berners-lee ) and a belgian scientist ( robert cailliau ) who worked at cern , which is , as the name says , an european organisation . 
  to be honest , i am having problems with this inner-spain nationalism as well . 
  spain exists in its form for several hundred years , why would someone born today go back to something not even their grand-grand parents saw ? 
  would be like me asking for the restoration of austria-hungary ... 
  some snippets that stood out for me :  the crushing of what i call the athens spring | |  people would come to listen to me in their thousands , | |  i 'm not going to give you names , and we will not sign it when we launch it . 
  | |  to to democratise it is actually a very radical idea that goes against every fibre in the body and soul of those people in brussels . 
  | |  i believe in staying in to subvert the rules . 
  even to go into a campaign of civil disobedience within . 
  | |  the three steps that i recommended as retaliation were , firstly , to announce the creation of a parallel payment system , a euro-denominated electronic system ; [ ... ] , to the tune of 27 billion . 
  that would be a major weapon to use i guess he think he is mel gibson in braveheart ... 
  ** context : ** there is a current arms deal with quatar for leopard 2 tanks and pzh2000 self-propelled artillery that is controversial within germany . 
  now japan is following e-stonia . 
  wow . . well done !, 
  no offense to tea , but i think i 'd rather sign up for a wine & fuck orgy . 
  if given the chance ... 
  let 's call it ` crisisgate ' !, 
  maybe we are reaching peak-lego ? 
  * worries *, 
  the headline seems a tiny bit overblown . 
  does everything have to be a `` crisis '' in todays reporting ? 
  yes , especially regarding earth observation , the field in which esa arguably now has overtaken the much bigger nasa . 
  welcome eesti !, 
   high standards are expected this is n't anymore the / r/europe i signed up for !, 
  nah , it 's foreign aimed . 
  for example there is also rt deutsch in * obviously * german and it 's as blunt and hamfisted as the main rt channel . 
  additionally there is a very large bad west/nato/useu crowd on all german speaking newspaper forums , which follows these sort of news outlets . 
  during the height of the ukraine crisis they drowned out all other `` normal '' posters on the pages of faz and sueddeutsche . 
  so in short : `` rt is propaganda '' is sadly not the non-sequitur we 'd like it to be . 
  why ? 
  the uk seems to mainly countweigh in a negative way . 
   also , it does not work -- my own script that blocks adblock-blockers blocks bild 's blocker . 
  that sounds useful .
