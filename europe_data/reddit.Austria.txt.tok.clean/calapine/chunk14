  quick summary of the report : * explosion of a surface to air missile slightly left and above of the cockpit . 
  determined by stringing the impact holes and triangulations from the cockpit microphones . 
  ( see first image ) * 800 impacts of `` high-energy objects '' of which 350 were recovered . 
  * blast damage and soot traces found on the fuselage . 
  missile parts where found within the wreckage . 
  ( second image ) * the shape of the objects ( cubic & bow-tie shape ) matches the pre-formed fragmentation warhead of a 9m38m1 missile , which is used by the buk system . 
  * this rules out other weapon systems like air-to-air missiles or s200/s300 . 
  * simulations show a 70 kg warhead best matches the observed damages . 
  this fits the buk missile . 
  * several analyses were made to determine the starting location from which a buk missile could impact the way it did .

  the closest i got was falling over the connection of a juicer and damaging the ( permanently attached ) end at the machine . 
  the plug was fine ... 
  in short , if you have no fuse in a the plug there is n't really anything that can break . 
  from wikipedia :  some who eat the cheese prefer not to ingest the maggots . 
  those who do not wish to do so place the cheese in a sealed paper bag . 
   the maggots , starved for oxygen , writhe and jump in the bag , creating a `` pitter-patter '' sound . 
  when the sounds subside , the maggots are dead and the cheese can be eaten .

   `` the battle for the fastest butt !!!! '', 
  october 27 , 2016 [ 16 ]  while sayaka is able to match rin 's speed , rin 's endurance is higher due to her larger lung capacity ; sayaka still manages to win by giving herself a wedgie , allowing for greater hip mobility and dramatically increased speed . 
  non wins her match by deflecting her opponent 's attack , but kazane loses hers when her opponent , mio , hypnotizes her by swinging her breasts like a pendulum . 
  i do n't see any fanservice here ... ^ ^ / s, 
  the reason is simply that the uk is n't part of the ariane program . 
  ( which means paying part of the development ), 
  interesting . 
  according to your [ link ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0vqprwv.png ) dover has 12.9 million passengers per year , calais only 10m .

   britain has given nissan ( 7201 . t ) a written commitment of extra support in the event that brexit reduces the competitiveness of its sunderland plant , in return for new production investments by the japanese carmaker , a source with knowledge of the matter told reuters . 
    ** in addition to unconditional investment aid **** , britain pledged in a letter to offer ** ** further relief if the terms of britain 's european union exit ended up harming the plant 's performance ** , the source said .

  russia will build the structure of the lander , but avionics , parachute and radar will be heritage from schiaperielli . 
  so the experience wont be lost . 
  there wo n't be a second lander . 
  esa will go straight to the rover and surface platform . 
  the issue was in the software and should be fixed by 2020 . 
  i would leave esa as it is . 
  the changes you describe would tilt the power even more towards the bigger states . 
  and while strict nationally quotes probably are n't needed , the amount of people from each country working in an institution should be relatively equal on a per-capita basis .

  yes , that . 
  they often come across as very arrogant . 
  the very least one can be is polite . 
  and , while mods are needed for every-day housekeeping , the general direction of a subreddit should n't up to few people with power issues . 
  that was informative !, 
  that 's pretty paranoid . 
  i hope my country is n't as shortsighted to automatically distrust experts because they might not be austrian . 
  the us does n't need a base in vietnam to be better supporter vs china than russia . 
  i think you meant to say `` more than '' ? 
  the payload were 2 communcation satellites for australia and india . 
  dual-launches are a typical ariane thing and one the reasons she remains competitive , as they bring down the price for the individual satellite customer . 
  the other one is her reliability : this was ariane 5 's 74 successful consecutive launch . 
  it now equals her predecessor ariane 4 's success streak , which reached 74 as well before being retired .
