   mr johnson told the sun : `` our policy is having our cake and eating it . 
    `` we are pro-secco but by no means anti-pasto '' . 
    half way through the interview with the sun , he also sang a bob marley to describe his tense relationship with the two other brexiteer cabinet ministers   asked about his relationship with brexit secretary david davis and mr fox , boris replied : `` we are a nest of singing birds . 
    `` in fact i think bob marley once wrote a song which goes , ` woke up this morning , smiled with the rising sun , three little birds on my doorstep singing sweet songs . 
    `` a melody pure and true . 
    `` this is my message for you . 
    `` do n't you worry about a thing cos every little thing is gon na be all right . ''' all i can say is that brexit seems to be in capable hands ... 
  i asked that before in another rosetta video , why do you europeans seem so disinterested in space ? 
  / r/europe seems to be a good example of that ... 
  i guess it means dont edit the titles of the articles you link . 
  what we call `` dont editorialize '', 
  so much love !, 
  how come space posts are always ranked so low on / r/europe ? 
  especially this rosetta series ... it 's awesome ... 
  i am a small , but nice ( and with some ... issues . . deep down ) country in central europe !, 
  greetings from austria !, 
  no telegraph ... please ...  . , 
  wow .

  / u/gentleman _ supreme is being `` funny '' . 
  the image is literally a mirror mounted on a wall .

  staying informed and becoming a millionaire are n't exactly on the same difficulty scale . 
  you know how there are different labeling conventions for food : eg orangesaft can only call itself saft if it 's 100 % juice , below that it would be orangennektar . 
  even less and we get limonade . 
  it would be funny if there was something like that for media as well . 
  wonder what the new name of bildzeitung would be ... , 
  thanks !, 
  i saw a lovely rendition of ode to joy with the lyrics in polish on youtube , but sadly i am not able to find it anymore .

  the map is wrong about austria : a referendum is n't something that 's going to happen .

  :( compare : 1 ) [ kaiserhymne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kapvntlxrmm ) 2 ) [ lied der deutschen ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lnymkgc7ae ), 
  because that is no `` lower and upper house '' , that 's just the nomenclature the graphic maker used to explain it to people with such systems . 
  you must be fun at parties . 
  i think it was specially made to look similar to the old ones and fit with the surrounding . 
  the inside also has a slight [ retro look ] ( https://i.imgur.com/wcjlkfv.jpg ) , featuring wooden seats and such . 
  no problem , hire polish mercenaries to fight it !,

  arte is great . 
  i wish they would extend their language to english , many more people in europe could watch them !, 
  it was made by comedy central uk , so it 's more like british self-mocking . 
  thanks for the thanks !, 
  it made me smile , glad it does the same for others . 
  good !, 
  it 's meant as lighthearted fun . 
  i think brexit is the wrong decision and the eu will miss the uk ( and visa versa ) , but it 's your call to make . 
  imho the video is only meant to mock the politicians and their folly behaviour . 
  i certainly do n't want to take the piss out of british citizens , irrespective if they think remain or leave is preferable .

   ** the controversial president is said to have had an ` invoice ' printed out outlining the sum estimated by his aides as covering germany 's unpaid contributions for defence . 
  **   said to be presented during private talks in washington , the move has been met with criticism from german and nato officials . 
    but the bill has been backdated even further to 2002 , the year mrs merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schr\u00f6der , pledged to spend more on defence . 
    ** mr trump reportedly instructed aides to calculate how much german spending fell below two per cent over the past 12 years , then added interest . 
  **   estimates suggest the total came to # 300bn , with official figures citing the shortfall to be around # 250bn , and with # 50bn in interest added on . 
    the times quoted a german government minister as saying the move was `` outrageous '' . 
    the unnamed minister said : `` the concept behind putting out such demands is to intimidate the other side , but the chancellor took it calmly and will not respond to such provocations . ''   and the paper quoted a source close to mrs merkel saying she has `` ignored the provocation '' . 
   fuck that guy . 
  all maps are projections . 
   `` and if i can put it to you , for someone like myself , it was in 1933 , the year of my birth , that hitler was democratically elected in germany .
