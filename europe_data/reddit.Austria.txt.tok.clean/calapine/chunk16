  he unleashed the most horrendous war . 
  this country played a unique role in securing his defeat . 
    `` so germany lost the war . 
  we 've just handed them the opportunity to win the peace . 
  i find that quite unacceptable . '' yes , lets keep fighting the wars of the last millenium . 
  great idea . 
  not the hre but a new empire called ** austria-belgium-bulgaria-croata-cyprus-czechia-denkmark-estonia-finland-france-germany-greece-hungary-irland-itala-lativa-lithuina-luxembourg-malta-netherlands-poland-portugal-romania-slovakia-spain-sweden **, 
  austria is correct . 
  vienna should be the imperial european capital !, 
  this is missing places like ceuta and french guyana . 
  also croatia . 
  and as the history is still developpin the title is incorrect . 
  i thought that was perkele ? 
   no one expects the spanish transition i see what you did there . 
  politico being edgy again . 
  i am not worried about the handshake . 
  i am worried about him starting a trade war because merkel embarrassed him, 
  please watch him saying it [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubxpsw2emb8 ), 
  the one year is representing the parliament in official functions . 
  very well made video . 
  i hope this plan will become reality . 
  5 year olds ... 
  funfact : if you had n't ended with the rhetoric `` questions , questions '' you would n't have gotten the silver !, 
  eu ** council ** president !, 
  thank you . 
  is there something special about batteries that requires such large halls or is it just because elon musk ? 
  this feels like [ its ] ( https://i.imgur.com/5imazop.png ) again ... 
  also points towards vampires . 
  the plot thickens . 
  why are they called giga-factories ? 
  i make sure to always play byzantium in civ 5 !, 
  do you have a link to a report about it ? 
  that 's what i do . 
  weeeeeeeee !, 
  but lots of forums i am on do n't support embedding videos . 
  old but good , 
  the parliament is n't throwing one either . 
  this is about schengen wide visa , not country specific ones . 
  in your example with france nothing would change with us-french visa agreements . 
  good interview , recommend reading . 
  irish-american maybe ? 
  there is also / u/executivemonkey . 
  we keep hims as dumb american mascot . 
  sailing school-ship of the deutschen marine . 
  laid to keel in 1958 , built by blohm & voss all future seagoing officers of the german navy are stationed on it for training . 
  83 personal and 138 training cadets . 
  an really interesting tradition i think , maybe someone more knowledgeable knwos which other navies have still do this today ? 
  i hope you have your `` european hookers '' tags ready ;*), 
  you probably won that bet , mr. monkey . 
  nonsense , that was great . 
  straight up 4 minutes self mocking !, 
   this film is an introduction to the council 's europa building , presented by jeppe tranholm-mikkelsen , secretary-general of the council of the european union , and featuring interviews with philippe samyn , architect and engineer of the europa building , kristin van hoolst , director of buildings of the council of the european union , and johan burgers , former director of buildings of the council of the european union . 
  to be correct though , it 's not about canceling his visit but only the meeting with the queen, 
  it 's ok , there is a treatment for that !, 
  emphasis on `` if '', 
  all true , but that are just the base stats . 
  who grantees we will present an unified front against trump ? 
  orban in hungary , the new romanian government and possibly italy lead by the 5 star movement , etc. . . might all switch sides . 
  what they you say ? 
  do you have a source ? 
  likley this : [ doonbeg ] ( http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/trump-environmental-tricks-stopped-expansion-of-doonbeg-35373034.html )  mr trump said while he had secured approval for the works at the doonbeg resort from the government , it would have taken `` years '' to overcome eu environmental hurdles . 
    `` what happened is i went for an approval to do this massive , beautiful expansion - that was when i was a developer , now i could n't care less about it - but i learnt a lot because i got the approvals very quickly from ireland , and then ireland and my people went to the eu to get the approval - it was going to take years - that was a very bad thing for ireland . 
  that was hyperbole , but i what i mean is that the eu is probably more a pushover in negotiations . 
  what i am afraid of his this : trump wants to appear tough but does n't actually have the balls to start a trade war with china . 
  so he will pick an easier target . 
  someone who wont sends tanks . 
  europe ...

  i had something in another country and getting the approvals ( sic ! ), 
  from europe was was very , very tough . 
  getting the approvals from the country was fast , easy and efficent . 
    ** getting the approvals from , the group , i call them the consortium ** was very very tough . 
  at least now we know why he dislikes the eu so much . 
  good bot , have an upvote !, 
  nice . 
  and something different for once ... thanks / u/courey, 
  ah , i was n't are of that . 
  express really seems to be shit though . 
  an actual headline from today : [ obama made his final call as president and the leader he chose to phone may make you angry ] ( http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/756603/obama-phone-call-merkel-white-house ) spoiler : it was merkel . 
  what kind of readers do they have that get mad when obama speaks with merkel ? 
  i like it !, 
  `` danish , total disaster '', 
  interesting how different the same news can be reported . 
  the express : britain threatens germany : you ` will pay a high price ' if the uk gets a bad trade deal leading brexiteers will send a devastating warning to germany that it will pay a `` high price '' if britain is punished by a bad trade deal when the uk leaves the eu .
