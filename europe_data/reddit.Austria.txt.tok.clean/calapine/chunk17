   * threat assessments : focusing on risks for eu personnel in a given country . 
  that could be accomplished by an [ underwater fighter with a crew of two and two torpedoes . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/submarine_s622.jpg ) you 'd need one hell of a skipper though . 
  well , do you want a situation where there are millions of hyperintelligent free-willed ai beings that might have plans that are not in best interest of the human race ? 
  ( to put it mildly ) the best fix would be if we figure out how to create intelligence without sentience . 
  hey should we give rights to ai ? 
  a kill switch is enough . 
  maybe anti-ai ai in some fancy future . 
  the `` threat '' that the headline refers to is about a tax-war and more us style policies :  ** welt am sonntag : ** the impression on the european continent is also that your government sees the future business model of the u.k. as being the tax haven of europe . 
  the government wants to introduce the lowest corporate tax rate among all industrialized countries . 
    ** hammond : ** we are now objectively a european-style economy . 
  we are on the u.s. end of the european spectrum , but we do have an open-market economy with a social model that is recognizably the european social model that is recognizably in the mainstream of european norms , not u.s. norms . 
  and most of us who had voted remain would like the u.k. to remain a recognizably european-style economy with european-style taxation systems , european-style regulation systems etcetera . 
  i personally hope we will be able to remain in the mainstream of european economic and social thinking . 
  but if we are forced to be something different , then we will have to become something different . 
    ** welt am sonntag : ** we do n't understand : who or what would force you ? 
    ** hammond : ** economic circumstances . 
  if we have no access to the european market , if we are closed off , if britain were to leave the european union without an agreement on market access , then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short-term . 
  in this case , we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness . 
  and you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do . 
  the british people are not going to lie down and say , too bad , we 've been wounded . 
  we will change our model , and we will come back , and we will be competitively engaged . 
  austria , liechtenstein , italy , germany and france should team up and share the spoils . 
  they ca n't stop all of us !, 
  since there is no reason to believe that swiss ( or danish ) articles are of a lower quality than uk papers it does show a general picture . 
   austria 142  germany 102 haha !, 
  we are soo clever and intelligent !, 
  does / r/europe provide psychological counseling for mods that have to read shitposts all day ? 
  and unrelated : do you experience urges to climb a tower with a sniper rifle ? 
  netter than fillon or le pen , non ? 
  i think you are on to something ... 
  i had a [ robotron printer ] ( http://141.45.146.230/media/htw_computermuseum/images/2/9408_ca_object_representations_media_254_mediumlarge.jpg ) when i was young . 
  it was shit , but i felt so hip !, 
  maybe !, 
  except it does n't appear in the article ? 
  the necklace looks like a pyramid . 
  is that guy really going `` illuminati !!!!, 
  [ / r/europe right now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bakxkzo.png ), 
  look at his comment history ... 
   the boxes contain about 40 different items including a play mat , a changing mat , a digital thermometer , a fleece jacket , several babygrows , a hooded bath towel , a reusable nappy and liners , a baby book and an organic sponge . 
  but not everyone is happy :  scottish labour inequalities spokeswoman monica lennon said the scheme `` looks like a massive missed opportunity '' to promote breastfeeding . 
   responding to a written parliamentary question from ms lennon , childcare and early years minister mark mcdonald said there were currently no plans to include direct aids in the boxes to support breastfeeding . 
   in his reply , mr mcdonald said : `` we will signpost parents to the new feedgood.scot website so that they can access up-to-date information which will help them make the right feeding choices for their babies . '', 
   ms lennon said : `` labour supports the aims behind the baby box but what it actually delivers is essential . 
   `` missing basic support like this makes it look like a pr exercise rather than a good piece of public policy . '', 
  scotland is the new finland !, 
  do n't be a twat . 
  whatever the merrits of the frontext warning are ( i still have to read it ) , the indepent headline is a bit tabloid . 
  i mean `` weaponising refugeees '' * come one ... *, 
  i am pretty sure iohannis did not reject her because of being muslim . 
  so why is it so prominently in the headline and right again in the first paragraph ? 
  my wish for 2017 would be to dial down this trend towards identity politics . 
  just a notch or two , please . 
  come again ? 
  everyone likes us and we are awesome !, 
  so you are calling this offical [ eurobarometer ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/resultdoc/download/documentky/76431 ) survey ( n = 27,768 ) absurd just on your hunch ? 
  err , than i have no clue what flag that is . 
  the flag of linz is red-white , so that 's not it . 
  here is a close up with better view , maybe someone knows : https://i.imgur.com/uxptqlc.jpg, 
  one i found after posting : flags in front of the parliament in vienna on [ half mast . 
  potential anschluss jokes aside , i think this is a touching gesture . 
  ~ ~ ( the flag in the middle is the one of berlin ) ~ ~ ** hugs from austria **, 
  * `` er ist altij iets de doen '' * dutch is really the baby-speak version of german !, 
  honestly until the day i knew that there was a chain called aldi i did n't see the a at all . 
  i thought it were some random lines . 
  do n't worry . 
  you 'll get linzertorte from us . 
  we think the same about the * wasserkopf wien . 
  you mean germany austrian . 
  and nothing for austria ? 
  no no !, 
  it 's totally normal . 
  what happened was ... * once upon a time ... * there was an austrian discount chain named after it 's founder helmut hofer . 
  one day a businessman named albrecht came and bought the chain , changed the logo but kept the name ( because a fairy told him that changing it would bring him 70 years of negative ebit ! ), 
  thus is looks like this : https://adventkalender.hofer.at/images/hofer-logo_mobil.svg see , it 's all ok !, 
  ** fun fact : ** aldi is called hofer in austria . 
   before becoming brexit minister , davis travelled to luxembourg to hear the case . 
  he argued that the british government was `` treating the entire nation as suspects '' by ignoring safeguards on retaining and accessing personal communications data . 
    davis , one of the most vociferous critics of the state 's powers to collect data on its citizens , withdrew from the case following his ministerial appointment . 
  oh god , the irony is killing me . 
   the `` fixit '' petition was launched in june by the youth organization of the country 's co-ruling , eurosceptic finns party in the wake of britain 's referendum vote to leave the eu . 
    the proposal gathered less than 34,000 supporters in six months . 
  the required number was 50,000 . 
  good news !, 
  [ here he is doing the same in his native language .

   also , it looks larger . 
  flair checks out !, 
  i now have this mental picture of the food mafia smuggling illegal chocolatines and re-packing them them as pain au chocolats to sell them at a higher price !, 
  i understand , thanks !, 
  which tastes better ? 
  and why not eat them both ? 
   chocolatine but it 's literally [ the same thing !?!, 
  the one on the right looks tastier . 
  what did italy choose ? 
  wait a moment , mr. mod , sir !, 
  you mean to suggest that the youtuber who also made the [ why women destroy nations * / civilizations - and other uncomfortable truths ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxpvwbzfakw ) video is not a credible source of the highest order ? 
  i think some clarification is called for !, 
  it 's the law, 
  actually makes me feel a bit sorry for her ( as person , not politician ) .
