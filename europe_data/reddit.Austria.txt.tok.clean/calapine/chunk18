  she is standing around like a confused granny that did n't get picked up . 
  it 's very , very obvious this is about russia . 
  i am glad europe seems to slowly wake up . 
  hey !, 
  i am not doing * it * unprotected ^ ^ / s, 
  thanks !, 
  i cant tell the difference between gone and cone . 
  dont they sound the same ? 
  i thought euronews was a joint-venture of public broadcasters . 
  how is it possible that an egyptian billionaire with ties to putin bought 53 % of it ? 
  sometimes we europeans are just stupid ... 
  what about they pay where the restaurants are ? 
  too naive ? 
   historically countries made alliances to improve their defense or otherwise advance important security interests . 
  in contrast , the u.s. uses nato as a form of international welfare , haha ... no . 
  because of vdb posting with a dog in the alps !, 
  it 's funny how everyone reports austria 's result as `` far right politican lost '' instead of `` austria having the worlds first green party president '' ^ ^, 
  hofer is far-right , but not a neo-nazi, 
  you are welcome !, 
  i 'd like to say kudos to the mods for the flair here . 
  i do n't think the title is overly editorializing , but it 's nice to know its not an accurate translation .

  this is really not a pleasant mental image . 
  well this is bullshit and a way to self-censor . 
  we are going to mars as well . 
  just yesterday the esa ministerial council ended and pledged another $ 340m to finish the exomars 2020 rover . 
   colonization plans just because a couple of ships accidentally sank would be a bad strategy even in a civilization game . 
  but we are n't playing civilisation . 
  moon and mars are science targets . 
  colonization is a thing for the future , no matter what musk says . 
  ** radio ** telescope, 
  spacex went from [ `` two orders of magnitude '' ] ( http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2893/1 ) ( ie 99 % ) to [ `` 30 % price reduction '' ] ( http://spacenews.com/spacexs-reusable-falcon-9-what-are-the-real-cost-savings-for-customers/ ) ( shotwell earlier this year ) to [ `` 10 percent price reduction '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnvx3xy.jpg ) ( shotwell this october ) i would n't hold my breath ... ** edit : ** fixed linked . 
  and austria !, 
  do n't forget about us !, 
  * puppy eyes *, 
   that 's the problem here , only the germans deserve compassion and consideration . 
  fits nicely in whole human subhuman ideology . 
   no one is saying that . 
  is today strawman day ? 
  up-voted for uplifting news . 
  we really need it . 
  kind of weak for cartoons of the week . 
  well , he is right, 
  his observation about the perception in us and european press is spot on , i was thinking the same during spacex landing attempts . 
  german press : `` yet another failure '' us press : `` hit the spot perfectly , almost made it ! '', 
  tldr : old people dress warm and sensible , kids run around at -10 \u00b0 c in tight jeans and open neck . 
  funfact : kotor was an important naval base of austria-hungary, 
  * notes british flair * now you said it , not us !, 
  good guy eu . 
  yes , the replies in here truly scare me . 
  and what is a random turtle life worth ? 
  how is this upvoted ? 
  if the pony is cute and you wear a pink dress reddit will care very much !, 
  \u00d6xit would be the obvious name in austria 's case, 
  for general europe / eu news i recommend : http://www.euractiv.com and probably the closest to your request : https://www.eurotopics.net/en/ this is a daily digest/summary of european press translated into english, 
  sorry , you are wrong . 
  as per the law establishing the dw it is obligated to perform independent journalism . 
  the intendant ( general director ) is responsible for the programme planning . 
  meh , he was a self promoter and not really a good general . 
  i still do n't understand why i was devoted so much . 
  will teach me not to get drunk and be honest i guess . 
  hangover and ashamed . 
  well , women are sluts . 
  at least i am i guess . 
  cant speak for my gender . 
  and i am not a slut , i just like guy likeing me . 
  ( i really drink too much too , will go to bed now , sorry ! ), 
  no , it 's not . 
  negative approval in this case means [ people that approve - people that do n't approve = < 0 ] . 
  when trump 's approval is cited as 35 % that refers to the 35 % of the voters that say yes , i approve . 
  and ignores the non-approvers, 
  why the downvotes , i was only joking . 
  :( / r/europe is the best !, 
  he is still typing . 
  i think that joke was too clever for / r/europe . 
  i liked it !, 
  btw , we females can dispense adhesive too . 
  we use it to keep the panties up . 
  what a stupid question !, 
  i should a bear hold dental floss with his huge paws ? 
  and they do n't have money to buy dental floss either ... 
  i disagree . 
  why limited to modern art . 
  also it 's ok to show differences between countries . 
  austria top !, 
  ( look at right bar , % of organic farming land ), 
  hah , that was great !, 
  oh doh , forgot where he came from ... 
  newton only if the uk joins the euro ;-), 
  this is a legal challenge , not article 7 , and does n't require unanimity, 
  a classic , that film !, 
  but if you are having an open relationship it 's not an affair ... 
  i am not at home until saturday but then i will try to look up the quote . 
  2 days, 
  actually hitler personally did n't even care about gdansk , it was just a tool for popular support and pressuring poland . 
  i remember reading that in private he stated he was ready to concede it ( poland ) if poland allied with germany . 
  well , you have been paying for the bags at the counter too . 
  at 20 to 40 cents , depending on the store , they are even more expensive than buying a trashy bag . 
  i wish they would keep the paper bags you , i keep forgetting to bring my own .
