  skylon and ssto ( single state to orbit , for those that do n't know ) are vaporware . 
  they look sexy but are not going to happen with current technology . 
  i do n't understand why it is so difficult to grasp the concept that to take away someone 's freedom of movement is basically taking away someone 's life because it 's not true maybe ? 
  due to anxiety and depression . 
  i spent a couple of years of my life without any social contact ( or family contact ) and only leaving the flat to buy food . 
  it 's perfectly doable , especially i guess if you do n't start out with a mood disorder to begin with . 
  i was with you until the `` morons '' . 
  you had the moral high ground . 
  never give up the high ground , just look what happened to anakin !, 
  he probably is n't reformable but he probably wo n't get out ever , even when his nominal sentence is over . 
  close . 
  he had ps 2 and he had a 3 . 
  and his office chair was n't comfy enough . 
  all in all it was serious enough for him to enter a hunger strike . 
  no , let 's clone [ empress elisabeth ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/winterhalter_elisabeth_2.jpg ), 
  during the times austrian railway still had proper food dining cars the experience was n't bad . 
  but admittedly the dinning cars from hungary with a slightly gaudy winered interior where much better ( and had more interesting dishes ) that was in the 90ies, 
  armenia joined the nato partnership for peace ( pfp ) programme . 
  can you explain the joke to me ?

  i read that as `` austrian bars '' as in `` cocktail bar '' and wondered why they wanted to have a party ...

  that 's true , but in this case i trust your german police . 
  well , the `` allege '' comes because the soviet 's first said in 1957 that he died in 1947 in his cells . 
  but later , in 1965 , admited that he was still alive . 
  several eyewitnesses reported seeing him alive in 1980 in soviet camps . 
  he was declared dead 71 years after his disappearance . 
  but technically , yes . 
  i do n't know ? 
  there is no need to paint putin as anything , he is bad enough . 
  i guess this unavoidable , so let 's just get over with it . 
  but let 's keep this friendly , [ and let 's not bicker and argue about who killed who .

  if hate the french means `` the french president makes my panties '' wet , then yes . 
  we do hate the french . 
  so much . 
  wishfull thinking , id say . 
  as reddit is fond of saying : technically correct , the best kind of correct . 
   10 downing street has ordered the royal navy to kill any f * cking frenchman who so much as looks at a british fish . 
    the order has been issued from the executive to coincide with the uk 's decision to withdraw from all and every international agreement agreed since ww2 to stop countries killing each other over matters that were once judged not serious enough to keep killing each other over . 
    frenchmen in particular have been warned to be exceptionally respectful of british fish from today . 
  to avert their eyes no matter how tempting the imagined mouthful . 
    even looking at the english channel with a pair of binoculars from a sand dune in calais could find a high explosive shell dropped on a frenchman 's head now that we have , wait for it ,   taken back control of the sea !, 
    the royal navy is to send its harrier jets across the channel to airdrop leaflets along the french coastline today informing the french that ,   ` we are prepared to use trident to defend whitby scampi -- you have been warned . '   when asked why they were only warning the french about our willingness to use a multi-million pound weapon to protect a few quid of scampi and not the germans too , the ministry of defence replied ,   `` we have to be sensitive of family relations at the top . ''   an aide to the prime minister also spoke about why frenchmen are being targeted in particular . 
    `` because brexiters really dislike frenchmen . 
  it 's hard to overstate how much some bumbling public schoolboy who got bummed all the way through secondary school by other more confident public schoolboys dislikes a frenchman 's sexual confidence . 
    get a man like that into high office and watch out frenchies ! ''   other nationalities to be warned especially are the irish , both of them . 
    `` the irish need to watch out too . 
  they keep trying to steal our horses and now they 're stealing our fish . 
  we know they 're thieves . 
  brexiters know this .
