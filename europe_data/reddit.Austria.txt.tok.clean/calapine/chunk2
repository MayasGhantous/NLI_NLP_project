  o.o edit : it 's % of gdp not millions $ , my bad . 
  next up : ni declares any referendum illegal and deploys troops to london ... 
   bitter together fify, 
  it looks exciting , i give you that . 
  i feel they give a shit about safety procedures  .  people running through the waves while cars dash by . 
  at one point someone of the ground crew almost gets swept of his feet . 
  as tourist on of those these ferry i would have a bad feeling . 
  yes . 
  maybe a little bit `` generic '' because it has to present an entire continent , but well done nevertheless . 
  that 's quite casual yes . 
  i do n't dress too fancy and nothing expensive at all ( quite poor ) , but jogging pants and t-shirt are for actual running only . 
  or maybe at home where no one can see me . 
  squirrel banks ? 
  kitty banks ? 
  and it works !, 
  i am going to buy me some of those euros !, 
  yep , without duplicates it looks like this : 1 . 
  facebook 3 . 
  youtube 4 . 
  orf ( state tv ) 5 . 
  wikipedia 6 . 
  amazon 7 . 
  derstandard.at ( newspaper with large online community ) 8 . 
  willhaben.at ( literally : want-have , ebay-like site ) 9 . 
  raiffeisen ( large bank ), 
  * hehe * i meant to say `` here is a rehost on imgur : '' ( tinypic seems to load slow ) , not commanding you to do it . 
  actually i think that stereotype is mostly dead already anyway . 
  at least in austria if anyone holds it they will bring it up against albania/kosovo/gypsies , not poland . 
  mate makes you sounds so english !, 
  what would be the dutch word for mate/dude ? 
   ~ ~ shame on me ~ ~ for an attempt of translation : kudos for you for an attempt of translation !, 
  90 % yes to germany , but only 40 % would visit austria ? 
  no need to fight !, 
  let 's agree that his face * and * his polices are abhorrent !, 
   alpine type of troll * bergtroll *, 
  i agree . 
  there are quite a few things that should be dealt with at the local level , but others not . 
  as / u/therky mentioned school systems , for example . 
  in austria it 's even more ridiculous : we have 9 different youth-protection laws , one for every state . 
  and that in a tiny country of 8 million people . 
  an independent scotland would be a very cool thing . 
  but i am not getting too excited - my guess is the vote will end with no . 
  * nonsense , everyone should adopt this !, 
  * slowclap * what a pun !, 
  so you are saying that bloggers = retards ? 
  * hmmm ... *, 
  good question , i do n't fully know . 
  tougher sanctions ? 
  direct military help for ukraine ? 
   `` a few thousand '' is n't correct . 
  italy alone had over 100,000 refugees this year already . 
  this . 
  i am ashamed at our ( europe and west in general ) reaction of `` meh , whatever '' . 
  putin is taking apart a country like a turkey and we stand there and watch . 
   do you know he had a more common nickname of `` butcher '' harris ? 
  i did not , thanks . 
  wiki tells me it was due to the losses his own airmen suffered . 
  interesting ... 
  haha ... same . 
  and turned on javascript when that did n't help . 
   so : strudel - turkish recipe schnitzel - invented in milano gulasch - hungarian that 's all austrian !, 
  let 's try : heaven is where : * the isp is romanian [ ( context ) ] ( http://www.antena3.ro/en/tech/romania-is-ranked-5th-in-the-world-at-internet-connection-speed-200686.html ) * the vodka is from poland [ ( context ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f91el9j.jpg ) * i am sure there is more ... !, 
  `` oh goodness , zombie bomber harris is at it again ! '', 
  there have been cases in which the satellite reached the orbit on their own . 
  [ artemis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/artemis_%28satellite%29 ) for example , another european satellite . 
  but it really depends on the details , how far of the intended position it was released , etc. . . 
  i am female and like cock , so it 's clearly * someone else 's * fault !, 
   i was n't blaming schengen for anything . 
  but with schengen i find news along the lines of `` even austria now houses foreign terrorists '' rather unsurprising . 
  schengen would only be an issue if they came from within europe . 
  according to another article the biggest group of militants in austria are chechnyans , i.e. 
  people who sought and got granted asylum here . 
  we really need to filter those people more carefully . 
   if you were right uk would also have raging hindus , taoists ** or jedi ** , but that ai n't happening . 
  yes , but only because palaptine nipped that problem in the bud before it got out of hand . 
  else we 'd all be speaking galactic standard now ... 
  it would be nice of them to join the sanctions in solidarity , but serbia is n't in the best shape economically so it 's understandable they are n't too keen on something like that . 
  you are giving it too much thought . 
  it 's a * tory mp * writing in the * telegraph * . 
  he is so anti-eu that the frigging ukip supports him . 
  [ wikipedia  ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/douglas_carswell )  the eurosceptic uk independence party decided not to field a candidate against carswell in the 2010 general election . 
  instead , ukip actively campaigned for his re-election as a result of his anti-eu views . 
  i 'd like something purple . 
  wow , that 's awesome . 
  they really should demand that compensation from russia for starting a proxy war . 
  i quite like ours ( at least on the outside ) , the reichtstag and the romanian palatul parlamentului . 
  what 's next , hookers of europe ? 
  sell them to finland !, 
  what * is * this ? 
  thanks . 
  i am sorry to inform you that of you are hope is on merkel there is n't much hope . 
  she is a prime opportunist and triangulator . 
   edit : my english is just terrible . 
  nonsense . 
  it 's quite good . 
  spot 20 for austria ( a small and relatively rich country ) is n't too impressive . 
  does anyone know why these differences exists ? 
   there are however three exceptions   you 're drunk/high as fuck   you want something   or you 're just a sick paedophile what about old people ? 
  here it 's mostly them who start a conversation and tell you their life story ... 
  no , it 's not !,
