  everyone else is too thick to realise it . 
  but we 've kept our beady eye on them ! ''   the royal navy has been further instructed to prepare for a swollen intake of fresh cheeked recruits to scrub the decks as the ministry of defence has been ordered to buy one extra ship to patrol the entire coastline of the united kingdom . 
    and in an added show of defiance , a group of ukip supporters have set up a giant billboard at dover informing europe ,   big booms if you touch are skampi !, 
  where keeping all the skampi for are scampi flavoured frys !, 
    the end . 
  of everything probably , given enough time . 
  do n't be sad though . 
  you are in control . 
  why is interpol refusing to arrest 60,000 terrorists ? 
  he clearly stopped giving a shit, 
  it 's basically the reverse `` what would jesus do ? '' . 
  do you ever get any ladyboys ? 
  bah , men are overrated . 
  hmm . 
  is that a noble gesture or a devious plot to keep the number of dip voters low ? 
  we need to make them fuck !, 
  i think that ease one of the fears , yes, 
  at least he tried !, 
  thank you !, 
  dear op , can we get a bit more backstory ? 
  ^ not ^ doubting ^ you , ^ just ^ interested, 
  euv - extreme ultraviolet lithography , invited by erdogan !, 
  [ major assholes !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sen8tn8cba4 ), 
  but we are !, 
  whether the eu has 96 % or 104 % of the us gdp does n't matter in the slightest . 
  the good old time when we were someone !, 
  ** sighs **, 
  so do i. 
  what is happening tomorrow ? 
  id really like that , unironically, 
  afaik that was only the re-purposed kroll oper which was used after the reichtstag was set on fire by evil * wink * communists * wink wink *, 
   team stronach now there 's a name i 've not heard in a long , long time . 
  yes , but the will keep the design because it 's classic . 
  i shit you not . 
  and the article then goes on to state that this is not the case . 
  thus the submission headline now claims the opposite meaning of the article content . 
  the actual title is : * `` vaccine ruling from europe 's highest court is n't as crazy as scientists think '' * and quote the article :  but legal experts contacted by nature say that the judgment says nothing of the sort , describing it instead as balanced and in line with long-standing legal traditions . 
  nature examines what the judgment means -- and what it does n't -- for future vaccine-compensation claims in europe . 
  he should never have given such a whip . 
  i am guessing so , but did some vote yes too ? 
  is there a breakdown how the cdu parliamentarians voted ? 
  not fair , you are going to get so much karma now . 
  what about me ? 
  * looks sad *, 
   you are one of the dumbest redditors i have encountered you are not helping your cause . 
  i agree , for orion they emphasis the european part a lot . 
  exomars is definitely esa . 
  roscosmos joined as a junior partner late in the programme . 
  basically the reverse to nasa-esa orion, 
  it 's not just tax . 
  when applying for * bedarfsorientierte mindestsicherung * ( needsbased minimum benefits ) i had to present my bank statements of the last 6 months . 
  i had a few not-illegal-but-embarrassing transactions in there and it was uncomfortable having the case worker go through them while i was sitting in front of him . 
  definitely learned a lesson . 
  disagree , the macron image is better . 
  i , too , wish he would stick his baguette into my economic area . 
  personally i like cash because i spend more when using a debit card, 
   not an issue anymore in a cashless society . 
  there are many direct money transfer apps available by now . 
  you missed the '' '' . 
  what / u/viermalvier is meant schwarzarbeit ( moonlighting ) . 
  for example my sister doing hairdressing on the side . 
   well , maybe all of the other nations were behind their time . 
  if everyone but one is behind the the times , than it 's clear the one is ahead of the times . 
   if google would be exactly the same and other people would just prefer bing , so much that google only had 30 % of the market , it would be okay to have biased results ? 
  as per competition law : yes . 
  again there is nothing wrong with having market dominance because of having the best product . 
  what is wrong and thus not allowed is using the dominance in market category a to conquer a different market category b. 
  now that 's a great bot . 
  that 's sad . 
  :( with best regards calapine, 
  a 100 % monopoly is n't required , only market dominance . 
   ** assessing dominance **  the commission 's first step in an article 102 investigation is to assess whether the undertaking concerned is dominant or not . 
    defining the relevant market is essential for assessing dominance , because a dominant position can only exist on a particular market . 
  before assessing dominance , the commission defines the product market and the geographic market . 
    ** product market : ** the relevant product market is made of all products/services which the consumer considers to be a substitute for each other due to their characteristics , their prices and their intended use . 
   geographic market : the relevant geographic market is an area in which the conditions of competition for a given product are homogenous . 
   market shares are a useful first indication of the importance of each firm on the market in comparison to the others . 
  the commission 's view is that the higher the market share , and the longer the period of time over which it is held , the more likely it is to be a preliminary indication of dominance . 
  ** if a company has a market share of less than 40 % , it is unlikely to be dominant . 
  **   the commission also takes other factors into account in its assessment of dominance , including the ease with which other companies can enter the market -- whether there are any barriers to this ; the existence of countervailing buyer power ; the overall size and strength of the company and its resources and the extent to which it is present at several levels of the supply chain ( vertical integration ) . 
   any one can start a search engine . 
  that was when ? 
  today : [ bing has cost microsoft $ 5.5 billion since launch ] ( https://www.geek.com/news/bing-has-cost-microsoft-5-5-billion-since-launch-1423117/ )  you do n't need to scale up overnight . 
  but good luck getting users . 
  you said it yourself , practically not possible . 
   as far as i am aware google are n't limiting it refusing entry of anyone . 
  they are simply prioritizing their own products , but they are showing everyone else 's ... 
  yes , and limiting is enough if they company in question has market dominance . 
  the point is punish google ( search ) for being good , but to prevent the google using it 's search dominance to get an advantage over it 's competition in other fields . 
  no , you are wrong there sorry . 
  to quote from d [ efinition of dominance within the meaning of article 82 ec ] ( http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:134898/fulltext01.pdf )  the passage from hoffman-la roche was referred to by the ecj in the akzo v. commission  case and the ecj continued stating , that in the absence of exceptional circumstances  indicating lack of dominance , a 50 % market share could be considered to presume  dominance, 
  not sure i agree . 
  i treat email like a letter . 
  / r/ofcoursethatsathing, 
  i am 1000 $ in the red and for me it 's a lot of money . 
  but has the same amount of planes than the somewhat smaller de gaulle . 
  any military fanbois ( not meant derisively ) that can explain the discrepancy ? 
  also the degaulle harnesses the magic power of the nucl\u00c8aire !, 
  qe runs on outdated fossil fuels .
