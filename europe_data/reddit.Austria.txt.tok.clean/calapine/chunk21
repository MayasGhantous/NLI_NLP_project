  after reading that ... holy shit . 
  i am glad you made it out . 
  did you have an armed escort ? 
  thanks . . taking a look right now !, 
  that 's a typical news thing . 
  over here it 's like `` 190 people in killed in plane crash near karatschi . 
  2 austrian believed injured '', 
  the album seems interesting , but as all the explanation are in polish it 's hard to make sense of it . 
  would you mind providing a translation ? 
  but france & europe is n't a small state . 
  russia has the gdp of italy . 
  and combined europe even has more soldiers , tanks and planes than russia . 
  people for that despite it 's size russia is a country of `` only '' 142 million people , less than germany and france combined . 
  france is definitely in the upper class of world military powers 2 . 
  he did n't say he would invade crimea and reconquer it for the ukrainians . 
  he has a tendency to do this , but sadly also `` things everybody agrees with '' are n't things everybody agrees with . 
  the other front runners were much more malleable to russian interests . 
  marine le pen flat out said the annexation was `` totally legitimate '', 
  ah thanks !, 
  learned a thing, 
  can we get a picture ? 
  the germans version sounds more optically appealing tnh, 
  judging from the preparation that looks someone cooked it at home w with bought sugo . 
  else looks fine . 
  do you like the hotel and would you recommend it ? 
  [ video of the traffic ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhtpcyojdki ), 
  actually you never made it to the other side . 
  you are posting from the afterlife . 
  well , come in !, 
  * holds door open *, 
  i am not sure that 's so foolproof . 
  are you familar with / r/repressedgonewild ? 
  that was a joke !, 
  [ i am sorry . 
  no , no !, 
  not like a fax machine , imagine it like a teleprinter jumping into action . 
  including allcaps and this a not a drill https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1bygnj-l_y, 
  thanks !, 
  i just tested the `` report '' button !, 
  for clarifaction : are `` poor man 's flairs '' with [ ] like [ satire ] [ translation in comments ] [ video ] allowed ? 
  even with brexit britain is still european ... 
  similar in some ways , but not a copy . 
  it 's a pure lifting body , no wings . 
  half-size ( to allow being launched on a small vega , x-37b requires an atlas v launch vehicle ) . 
  landing with guided para foil instead of runway . 
  it 's based on the esa 's ixv ( [ intermediate experimental vehicle ] ( https://www.rocketstem.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ixv_prototype_hoisted_onto_ship.jpg ) ), 
  not going to happen . 
  take a look at reaction engines [ website ] ( https://www.reactionengines.co.uk/ ) . 
  they have dropped every mention of skylon ( even in the vehicle section ) and present themselves as engine manufacturer . 
  the only time the word `` skylon '' is spelled out is in the history section ( `` our story so far '' ), 
    le bourget , france -- although europe 's space rider reusable spaceplane is three years or so from its debut , the european space agency is already making plans to privatize the unmanned orbital vehicle . 
    by 2025 , esa officials said , space rider could be operating commercially , flying science payloads and bringing them back to earth for roughly $ 9,200 per kilogram . 
   arianespace , the evry , france-based launch services provider , would likely serve as space rider 's operator , offering industry and government customers the opportunity to fill the spaceplane 800-kilogram payload capacity with microgravity science , materials testing , telecommunications and robotics demonstrations . 
   space rider is being developed by thales alenia space and lockheed martin under the direction of the italian aerospace research centre , cira . 
  funding for the program 's design phase was approved in december by esa 's 22 member states . 
    a 2020 test flight would see space rider launch atop arianespace 's vega-c rocket ( which makes its own debut in 2019 ) and land on a runway on one of the atlantic 's azores islands , santa maria . 
    during operational flights , space rider will orbit 400 kilometers above the earth for a few months at the time , opening its payload bay doors to expose experiments to the space environment . 
  customers will pay roughly $ 9,200 kilogram to fly their payloads on space rider , according to giorgio tumino , esa 's space rider and vega rocket development program manager . 
    `` this cost is usually only to go into orbit , but in this case [ with space rider ] it is to go and come back to earth , '' tumino told spacenews here . 
  `` we really believe there is a market , a niche , that will drive this . 
  we have already done preliminary studies , analyses and we see that it [ space rider ] is a very convenient tool . ''  tumino said arianespce , as the commercial partner for the vega rocket , will likely operate space rider , as well . 
    space rider , at an expected 4-5 meters in length , will be about half the size of the u.s. air force 's x-37b unmanned orbital spaceplane . 
  x-37b completed its fourth classified mission in may , landing at nasa 's kennedy space center just shy of a two-year stay in orbit . 
    after space riders 's first mission in 2020 , it would fly five more missions spaced six to 12 months apart , according to tumino . 
  during this first few years of operations , a decision would be made about how many space riders to build for commercial operations ; arianespace , he said , might decide to operate a fleet of them . 
    during development , a full-scale space rider model will be dropped in 2019 from an atmospheric balloon or helicopter to test the vehicle 's parafoil landing system . 
   space rider is based on esa 's successful suborbital re-entry test vehicle , the intermediate experimental vehicle ( ixv ) . 
  in 2015 , the ixv flew halfway around the planet in 100 minutes before parachuting into the pacific ocean for recovery . 
  i am sure that 's from americans pledidung to the us . 
  all the kids say is `` so help me god '', 
   am i the only one that loves regulations as long as they are not abusive ? 
  nope !, 
  actually a hard job . 
  can you image having to say : `` my government will . . '' followed by a bunch of policies you do n't agree with ? 
  i wonder if they can get them back ? 
  i once overdosed on grapes , it was not fun . 
  yup  but a new report released this week by the american security project , or asp , concludes that most military drones are only `` generally slightly cheaper to both acquire and operate than conventional fighter jets . '', 
    despite claims to the contrary , unmanned planes require a large crew : there is one remote pilot , another remote crew member to operate the valuable cameras mounted on many , and `` because a drone is not operated individually , but as part of a system consisting of several aircraft , sensors , ground control , and satellite linkages , the number of personnel needed to operate a predator combat air patrol ( cap ) is estimated to exceed 80 people , '' states the report . 
  it refers to the predator unmanned plane that has been used in afghanistan , iraq , pakistan , and allegedly in yemen . 
  the number of crew members needed to operate other drone fleets composed of four aircraft can approach 130 , asp concludes . 
    in a blow to drone proponents , the report concludes they have a `` greater tendency toward mishaps '' than piloted warplanes . 
  too early . 
  the next `` thing '' will be planes and drones working together , not the later replacing the former right away . 
  there is no need for a new law though , just an amendment to commission proposal . 
  that 's why the lack of right of initiative is n't as bad as it sounds , once the commission proposes something the parliament can basically rewrite it ( as long as it can pass the council ), 
  guys , this is outdated , the video is from 2013 and reese-mogg talks about the old nizza voting rules , only valid until 2017 . 
  now it works like this :  article 16 of the `` treaty on european union '' , [ 22 ] as amended by the treaty of lisbon , stipulates that the council voting arrangements of the nice treaty applied until 31 october 2014 . 
  [ a ] article 16 also states the conditions for a qualified majority , effective since 1 november 2014 ( lisbon rules ) :    * majority of countries : 55 % ( comprising at least 16 of them ) , or 72 % if acting on a proposal from neither the commission nor from the high representative , and  * majority of population : 65 %     a blocking minority requires -- in addition to not meeting one of the two conditions above -- that at least 4 countries ( or , if not all countries participate in the vote , the minimum number of countries representing more than 35 % of the population of the participating countries , plus one country ) vote against the proposal . 
  thus , there may be cases where an act is passed , even though the population condition is not met . 
  this precludes scenarios where 3 populous countries could block a decision against the other 25 countries . 
      ** note that the lisbon rules eradicated the use of `` artificial '' voting weights . 
  this move , first proposed in the constitution , is based on the size of populations ** and , at the same time , acknowledges the smaller member states ' fears of being overruled by the larger countries . 
  the video is from 2013 and the the voting system it describes is outdated since 2017 , the new system works like this : for a majority , * 55 % of the member states * representing at least 65 % of the eu-population . 
  have to vote for a proposal . 
  the concept of each state having a certain number of votes ( 27 for britain , 3 for malta , like in your example ) is not in place anymore . 
  well the point is the uk govs position was different just last friday : [ britain says no eu exit deal unless future relationship taken into account ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-politics-eu-brexit-iduskbn1971pq ), 
  who where you before ? 
   wait ... are you saying that sobotka is not tech savy and a great minister ??? 
   how did you find the draft and who the rapporteur was ? 
  i am very clever .
