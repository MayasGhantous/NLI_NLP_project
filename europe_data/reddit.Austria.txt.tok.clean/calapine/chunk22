  ^ / s well ... actually : the draft is linked in the article and the name of the rapporteur is mentioned on the [ first page . 
  so single market yet , but a joint court ? 
  might as well stay in the eu , no ? 
  oh ok , never noticed . 
  well , congrats !, 
  fascists !, 
   btw , since when are you a mod ? 
  where ? 
  aww , that 's a cute saying . 
  that 's for the germans only . 
  besides that it would n't help ** not ** to bring up 1015 -- 1016 cnut 's invasion of england 1066 norwegian invasion of england 1202 -- 1214 anglo -- french war 1262 -- 1266 scottish -- norwegian war 1470 -- 1474 anglo-hanseatic war 1585 -- 1604 anglo-spanish war 1627 -- 1629 anglo-french war 1652 -- 1674 anglo-dutch war 1727 -- 1729 anglo-spanish war, 
  i guess take your [ pick ] ( http://i.imgur.com/p6fheso.png ) ? 
  i just looked up who the parliament rapporteur for this change is and it 's marju lauristin from ... [ estonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marju_lauristin ) . 
  what 's it with estonians being so tech savy ? 
  o.o stop making the rest of us look bad !, 
  here is the full amendment [ text ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2fnonsgml%2bcomparl%2bpe-606.011%2b01%2bdoc%2bpdf%2bv0%2f%2fen ) .

  in the eyes of the daily mail it 's enegery conversation guidelines by the eu that are to blame . 
   for just # 200,000 , life-saving sprinklers could have been installed . 
  instead , priority seems to have been given to meeting eu targets for energy conservation , with the contractors using inferior exterior cladding of a type banned in other countries and insulation known to emit lethal cyanide . 
   `` they applauded us as we went through one town -- that 's never happened to me before , '' said michael , a lance corporal who for security reasons could not provide his last name . 
   next up : the entire bundeswehr relocating to lithuania because `` it 's nicer there '' . 
  `` the cringe is strong with this one '' good idea , execution somewhat less . 
  yes , it was approved in the first of three parliamentary readings . 
  and the council needs to agree too . 
  but as the vote was the [ vote ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fn1a0no.png ) was so overwhelming in favor and supported by all major groups it 's very likely this will pass . 
  in what way is it misleading ? 
  did n't know this song , thanks !, 
  or isa - international space agency efsa - europe & friends space agency, 
  the austrian bundesheer has a special horse breed , the haflinger for mountain operations . 
  i am guessing it 's because germany is more export-based , thus more vulnerable to swings in the global economy . 
  please do . 
  oops . 
  i do n't speak so good !, 
  whether you consider it reasonable is n't the question though . 
  the negation mandate does n't lie in the hands of the eu , it can only be changed by all 27 members agreeing on it . 
  and this wont happen . 
   britain said on friday that no deal could be struck on exiting the european union unless the future relationship with the bloc was taken into account . 
    prime minister theresa may wants to negotiate the divorce and the future trading relationship with the eu before britain leaves in march 2019 , followed by what she calls a phased implementation process to give business time to prepare for the impact of brexit . 
    `` as we set out in the article 50 letter , our view is that withdrawal agreement and terms of the future relationship must be agreed alongside each other , '' a spokesman for britain 's brexit ministry said . 
    `` we believe that the withdrawal process can not be concluded without the future relationship also being taken into account , '' the spokesman said . 
  `` the withdrawal and future are intimately linked . '', 
  is someone spiking may 's tea ? 
  there is literally zero chance the 27 others will agree to this . 
  it has 26 \u00b0 c degrees here in linz , austria . 
  and that 's too much, 
  the current pipelines are n't even closed to be at maximum capacity . 
  economically nord stream 2 does n't make sense , it 's all about cutting out ukraine and poland . 
  we should n't be an accomplice to this . 
  nord stream 2 should n't be build , if the sanctions help kill it , good . 
  but how should we call it ? 
  why ? 
  it 's about this idea : [ eu 's strasbourg parliament should become a university ] ( https://euobserver.com/opinion/134516 ), 
  i found some extra information :  germany and airbus defense and space said they 're in the initial stages of a new program to build the luftwaffe 's sixth generation fighter , which has been named the future combat air system ( fcas ) . 
    fcas will replace the luftwaffe 's aging fleet of panavia tornado fighter bombers and complement the luftwaffe 's eurofighter typhoon air superiority fighters . 
    ** fcas will likely be a twin-engine , twin-tail aircraft piloted by two crewmen . 
  ** the bundeswehr ( federal german armed forces ) plans for fcas to be operational between 2030 to 2040 . 
    ** fcas will be a `` system of systems '' that combines manned and unmanned aircraft into one operational unit . 
  **   ** `` in principle , it could be a system of systems -- either a manned and unmanned combination , '' said alberto gutierrez , head of the eurofighter program . 
  **   ** '' ( we have determined that unmanned combat air vehicles ) ucavs will not be at technology state ready by 2030-40 to support eurofighters . 
  it could be optionally manned , with two crew -- one for command and control ( and one pilot ) . 
  '' **   a second crewmember is key for the fcas concept of operations , which will have the fighter operate in a wider battle network , potentially as a command and control asset or ucav/uav mission commander . 
    ** fcas will also operate as a `` networked node '' controlling `` missile truck ucavs '' and drone swarms in contested airspace . 
  **   the concept for fcas first popped up in mid-2016 . 
  it was first called the next generation weapon system ( ngws ) intended to replace the tornado . 
    in late 2016 , airbus defense and space unveiled its concept fcas to meet the luftwaffe 's requirement for its own stealth fighter . 
  this is so dumb , it can not be true . 
  it 's problem is that it 's three planes shoved into one hull . 
  overall it 's shitty air superiority fighter but a decent strike craft . 
  it would only replace the strike-focused aircraft like f18 and tornado . 
  there still will be the eurofighter , the rafele and the gripen which are all relatively new and in service until 2050-ish . 
  it 's a good idea considering that there are right now around ~ 450 tornado , 460 f-16 , ~ 150 f/a -18 in european service that eventually need to be replaced . 
  the f-35 might be a suitable choice , but buying over 1000 planes would be an unneeded present for the american producers . 
  better to develop a local alternative with export chances . 
  correct . 
  i wrote them an email , lets see if they fix it . 
  i prefered eads as name , it reminded me of the [ uac ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pizafwyowc ) . 
  ah well . 
  build a new one ( the current brussels chamber is ugly inside ) , make it the only permanent seat of the parliament and turn strasbourg into an european university . 
  problem solved . 
  my consulting fee is $ 10,000 . 
   germans wo n't ever reflate their economy . 
  they 'll just wait europe to break and try to maximize money during the time left . ^ [ citation ^ needed ],
