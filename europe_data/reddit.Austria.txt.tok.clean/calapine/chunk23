  i know vw is partly state owned . 
  but that aside , as long as other car companies were treated the same way ( saying if as i do n't know too much about the scandal ) than they only have themselves to blame . 
  so if the accusing are well founded , and not just a smokescreen ( something the russian 's like to do when they want to punish a country ) then i wont protect european/germany mega-company just because they are on `` our '' side . 
  well , that 's vw 's problem . 
  i would say germany 's role vis-a-vis the eu is pretty similar to how you describe california . 
  anyway , it 's good we co-operate . 
  that looks pretty much like it . 
  your best chance is informing the police and leaving contact details . 
   germany and california have agreed to cooperate in the fight against climate change following washington 's decision to withdraw from the landmark paris agreement of 2015 . 
    germany , europe 's largest economy , and california , the united states ' largest economy will support the work of the `` under 2 coalition '' which includes cities , regional governments and states , german environment minister barbara hendricks said saturday . 
    `` we can not achieve our climate goals without the engagement of local and regional communities . 
  that has become even clearer after the us withdrawal from the paris climate agreement , '' hendricks said after agreeing on the joint approach with california governor jerry brown in san francisco . 
    `` california and germany unite the world leaders in the fight against climate change , the existential threat of our time , '' brown said in a statement released by the german ministry . 
  who needs trump !, 
  hk g36 replacement has already been decided . 
  it is very likely that the next one will be hk 416 . 
  europe should be depicted as europa sitting on a chair .

  psa : the poster is a troll from t_d, 
  since the webpage is addresses not only to researcher but also students and ngo members i doubt it is intended for just the too 100 researchers worldwide . 
   explain to the spouse and children that they will have less money and flexibility in life , why should live in the us be better than in france ? 
  personally i definitely would n't want to move there . 
  [ macron 's tweet ] ( https://twitter.com/emmanuelmacron/status/872828903978668033 ) [ the official website ] ( https://www.makeourplanetgreatagain.fr/ ) it is backed up by funds as well . 
  [ how do i finance my project as researcher ? 
  ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/db0cbzqxuaaov4v.jpg ) this is excellent trolling in any case and i am curious how many people france can sway with this offer . 
  this is an onion-like article , but , if it were a genui proposition in this case i would support may . 
  slot-machine gambling bars are quite a problem in austria and are usually frequented by people who ca n't afford it . 
  oh wow , the montenegrin hymn is badass .

  i did n't even know this exists ... good job , i guess !, 
  but the point stands that there is no point to to create a leopard 3 , leclerc 2 , ariete 2 ( the italian one ), 
  good point , i would like to know as well . 
   trying to tell the french military that they cant have their leclerc tank and they must replace it with leopard , would be quite a challenge . 
  well , actually something like that is going to happen : krauss-maffei wegmann , producer of the leopard 2 , and nexter , builder of the leclerc , have merged into kant : [ ** k ** \\ ( mw \\ ) ** a ** \\ ( nd \\ ) ** n ** \\ ( exter \\ ) ** t ** \\ ( ogether \\ ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kant_project ) when the times comes to replace leo2 and leclerc there only will be a single french-german tank . 
  * clercopard ? 
  le leo ? 
  * who knows !, 
   san francisco-based uber charges lower fares than rival ride hailing apps . 
  in britain , its competitors ' fares include 20 percent value added tax ( vat ) on booking fees , but uber 's fares do not . 
    uber is able to avoid vat by exploiting a loophole in how the tax is collected for business-to-business sales across eu borders , which arises because it treats its 40,000 uk drivers as separate businesses , each too small to register for vat . 
    it confirmed to reuters that it does not pay value added tax on the fees it charges british drivers . 
  by contrast , two of its main uk rivals , gett and mytaxi , both said they do pay vat on their fees . 
  freeloading cunts . 
  military competing with the us is not the point of this . 
  all true , but for some reason i think of the kaiserhymne as this version .

  damn , now i feel old :(, 
  three months, 
  should n't we use the base unit ? 
  ` europe metering closer to a plan ! ', 
  i hope we do n't . 
  once they are ready they should be free to join . 
  ah , ok thanks . 
  so it should have been `` else it catches you '' ? 
  uhh ... can you give an example ? 
  can you be bavarian without voting for the cdu ? 
  now i wonder what temperature the brazilian lidle lasagne requires ... 
  do n't be smug and explain what the issue is :p, 
  looks like normal supermarket lasagne ? 
  when trump nukes europa because we export too many cars to the us i am going to blame you for it !, 
  we have strawberries in austria too , so it feels a bit off to buy some that traveled ~ 2400 kilometers . 
  i rather spend my co2 budget to have a holiday in spain . 
  ( when i was a little kid our family staid with friends from formentera . 
  i developed a sun allergy but they buried me in sand at the beach and floppy hat on the head so i could still join them . 
  want to go there again ... ), 
  what i meant is seasonally . 
  but a good point , greenhouse vs truck is not something i know about . 
  i do buy american , but i avoid companies that are especially egregious . 
  facebook , mcdonalds , uber . 
  but the same rules applies to non-american firms , no nestle products in my house . 
  and no capsule coffee , whether it 's nestle or otherwise . 
  the other rule is fruit , vegetables only locally . 
  obviously there are no austrian bananas , but i dont buy strawberries from spain in winter , for example i do n't think that 's especially much , but the least i can do is not support the worst offenders . 
  trump could leave because it 's not strong enough . 
  would make all sides happy :p, 
  sagrada familia or berlin airport ... which one will finish first ? 
  that 's so poetic . 
  newsthump is an onion-like site . 
   i want this to be real and i do n't even have cats nor vagina !, 
  you know there are methods nowadays to fix this ? 
  also * amazing !, 
  stupid !, 
  weak !, 
  smart !, 
  tough !, 
  huge !, 
  winning !, 
  * that guy basically a walking and talking urban dictionary . 
  i will put out for mods !, 
  is that even legal ... i thought the uk has exclusive access to any ex-colonies ? 
  i am sure the queen will veto this !, 
  there are good nazis , like grammar nazis , for example . 
  haha . 
  imaging european storm troops diamond rauting each other as salute !, 
  i liked macrons balancing act here , he called rt as propaganda in front of putin . 
  but this was enbedded in the context of him praising russia 's contribution in ww2 and offering ( talks about ) co-operation in syria , while also emphasing that further chemical attacks would be met with french retribution .
