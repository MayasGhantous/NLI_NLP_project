  a much `` harder '' stance most western leaders where willing to take but at the same time treating russia as a partner and avoiding to fall into `` anti-russian '' rhetoric .

  we should have an european carrier called `` donau '' just like in freelancer !, 
   unless we want to project force on a global scale and i really do n't want us to do that . 
  what 's the point of power projection beyond the mediterranean and africa . 
  should we mess with china ? 
  no thanks . 
  you really do not need aircraft carriers in the mediterranean , it 's a small pond .

  you have no power here !, 
   usa is spending too much , europe is spending too unwisely . 
  this . 
  imagine the us armed forces would spend `` only '' $ 250 billion per year . 
  they probably would n't have 11 carriers but a few less , and not [ 800 bases around the world ] ( http://time.com/4511744/american-military-bases-overseas/ ) but maybe only 400 . 
  but they would still be the singlest strongest military on the planet and they 'd still be able to defend the us . 
  and those $ 253 bn/year is combined eu defense budget . 
  only that it is diluded over 28 separate armies . 
  just in , from the daily express : [ illuminati meeting ?

  i would put the sun and daily mail in a category of their own . 
  besides that , yes good summary . 
  from the little i gathered by researching on the internet \u2122 it seems the daily express takes the cake , even ahead of the sun . 
  or is that an even more `` enjoyable '' tabloid around ?

  it should arrive any day now !, 
  it does n't influence the content of the european productions , only says there has to be a certain amount in it . 
  member states made the decision : the vote was 23 for to 5 against . 
  http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-council-latest-votes.html will have the votes eventually , but they usually lag behind a few days . 
  translation ( by me ) :  the uk , denmark , finland , the netherlands and luxembourg did not support the compromise , but were overruled by the other states . 
  i do n't know . 
  unless i am mistaken the european commission , european parliament and the council still have to agree on a common draft , so there could be more changes upcoming . 
  probably already the case indirectly : pretty sure +80 % content in netflixusa is american to begin with . 
   aka the freer nations err ... [ theresa may to create new internet that would be controlled and regulated by government . 
  ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/theresa-may-internet-conservatives-government-a7744176.html ), 
  for me there are several reasons : 1 . 
  against an overwhelming competition like hollywood it might very well be necessary to have some protection for local production & studios to allow them to even get off the ground . 
  same reasons as to why we have grants for film-makers and other artists . 
  art is n't a commodity like others . 
  a table lamp will be the same whether it 's produced in a factory in china or poland . 
  that 's not true for a film or tv-shows , so the rules here are different . 
  to preserve/champion languages and local culture . 
  if we apply free market thinking in this area we dump languages for english . 
  that 's not a desirable outcome ( at least for me ) . 
  according to another article the vote in the council went : ** against : ** great britain , denmark , finland , netherlands , luxembourg ** for : ** all other 23 members, 
  the original statement by the commission when hey proposed the changes ( back than it was still a 20 % quota ) :  ** how is european culture strengthened by the new directive ? 
  **  while european tv broadcasters invest around 20 % of their revenues in original content , this figure represents less than 1 % for on-demand providers ( source ) . 
  the proposal therefore will aim at encouraging new investment in european works . 
   under proposed rules , tv broadcasters will continue to be obliged to broadcast at least 50 % share of european works ( including national content ) in viewing time . 
  video-on-demand services -- which already have to promote european works under current rules -- are subject to more specific obligations : they need to ensure at least 20 % share of european content in their catalogues and should give a good visibility ( prominence ) to european content in their offers . 
   the proposed rules also include a mandatory exemption for companies with a low turnover and low audiences as well as small and micro enterprises . 
  it could also be inappropriate to impose such requirements in cases where -- given the nature or theme of the on-demand audiovisual media services -- they would be impracticable or unjustified . 
   overall , strengthening the promotion of european works for on-demand services will lead toa broader and more diverse offer for europeans . 
  this will have a positive impact on cultural diversity and bring more opportunities for european creators . 
   ** why is a quota needed at eu level ? 
  wo n't it be an extra-burden for businesses ? 
  **   quotas already exist in more than half of eu member states ( see impact assessment , annex xiii ) . 
  this is required either as a standalone obligation ( e.g. 
  cyprus , hungary , lithuania , malta , slovakia ) or in combination with other joint or alternative obligations ( e.g. 
  france , croatia , czech republic , italy , poland , romania , slovenia , spain ) . 
  the required shares in the catalogues vary considerably between member states ( 10-60 % ) . 
  this is why minimum harmonisation at eu level is needed , so that all europeans can have access to at least some european audiovisual content . 
    it should not be an extra-burden for businesses : on average , in the eu , european films already account for 27 % of all films available in video-on-demand catalogues ( according to a 2015 study by the european audiovisual observatory ) . 
    more specifically :  - share of eu films in 75 video-on-demand ( vod ) catalogues : 27 %   - share of eu films in 16 subscription vod catalogues : 30 %   - share of eu films in netflix : 21 %   - share of eu films in itunes : 21 % . 
   ** how can video-on-demand services give adequate prominence to european works ? 
  **  there is a wide range of tools to ensure visibility of european works , e.g. 
  indicating the country where a film or series comes from ; providing possibilities for searching for european works ; placing information and materials promoting european works , including in the home/front page ; using trailers or visuals . 
  the argument 's from the commision , when they first proposed the direcetive :  ** how is european culture strengthened by the new directive ? 
  **  while european tv broadcasters invest around 20 % of their revenues in original content , this figure represents less than 1 % for on-demand providers ( source ) . 
  the proposal therefore will aim at encouraging new investment in european works . 
   under proposed rules , tv broadcasters will continue to be obliged to broadcast at least 50 % share of european works ( including national content ) in viewing time . 
  video-on-demand services -- which already have to promote european works under current rules -- are subject to more specific obligations : they need to ensure at least 20 % share of european content in their catalogues and should give a good visibility ( prominence ) to european content in their offers .
