  well , that sucks . 
  i do n't see an issue with holding specific courses in english to train students , but competly replacing your own language is just mind boggling, 
  maybe they 'll hold a referendum to join germany !, 
  i am sure putin would reacto to that in a restrained manner . 
   typical british comedy satire what was typical british about his act ?

  that why iceland that does n't use the euro did n't have a banking crisis and did n't need to get bailed out by the imf . 
  lulz @ facebook trolling on the internet . 
  what a loser . 
  now we only need some after-game-rioting and americans will truly have mastered all aspects of football !,

  what is there to say ? 
  what upsets me more than than the us spying on europeans is european governments helping them with it . 
  it 's really disheartening when your own government collides with a foreign power against it 's citizens . 
  possible . 
  my guess would be it 's done by turkish < 18 years old wanna-be macho skriptkiddies though . 
  and really , it 's so silly that it is n't even offensive . 
  the only one who would benefit from false-flagging this could be our homegrown right-wingers . 
  and i do n't think they have the brains to `` hack '' anything . 
  ot but : is bing any good ? 
  yes .

  the turkish pm erdogan is coming to austria on a ` private ' visit to speak in a stadium in front of about 7000 turkish-austrians . 
  after his earlier speeches in cologne , germany , caused some controversy the austrian fm asked him publicly to not make any inflammatory statements . 
  obviously that did n't go over too well with some of his supporters .

   cameron , who opposes juncker 's commission bid , has requested last week that the future british commissioner be given the post of commission vice-president in charge of overseeing a `` cluster '' of portfolios comprising the internal market , competition , trade and energy . 
   in addition , london wants the strategic post of commission secretary general for a british national , and other `` small things '' , two sources told euractiv . 
   the `` clusters '' would give a super-commissioner status to four or five commissioners , while the rest would be relegated to junior commissioners . 
  a junior commissioner would be answerable both to the commission president and the respective `` cluster commissioner '' . 
   according to the advocates of the `` cluster commissioners '' some junior commissioners would not even have a cabinet , which normally have a staff of around 30 people . 
  so cameron ` only ' wants the most important policy areas and the vice presidency all for himself . 
  oh , and some other `` small things '' . 
  that will go over well !, 
  but ... the fjords !, 
  judging from the flair i guess he/she holds a grudge against serbia .

   there is `` afri-cola '' from cologne , which is mostly a nostalgia brand , but also commonly found at events which prefer not to sell coca-cola . 
  my father used to work as traveling salesman for a distributer of afri-cola . 
  much nostalgia here . 
   we 're just a bunch of dorks . 
  let 's not forget that . 
  wait !, 
  now * you * are doing speaking for an entire group thing . 
  longer article here on [ s\u00fcddeutsche.de ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/eu-kommissionspraesident-merkel-bekennt-sich-zu-juncker-mit-hintertuer-1.1979673 ) which makes it sounds somewhat less definite . 
  i have a feeling merkel is just hedging bets here and we do n't know for some time how this will end . 
  the danger for juncker lies with the european council . 
  in the parliament juncker has his own epp and most probably those of the s & d as well , enough for a majority . 
  more modest presence and more timid politics than barroso ? 
  i doubt it . 
  voted the choices i considered where greens and ` europa anders ' ( ~ ' a different europe ' ) , which is a bit weird election-coalition of the pirate and communist party . 
  in the end settled for greens , admittedly a bit of a tactical choice ( they are sure to make it over the 4 % requirement ) . 
   i think it 's clear here that the national leaders want another pushover commission . 
  correct . 
  and while i am not too fond of junckers ( and his political position ) he would still be a step up fro barosso . 
  which i guess why some national governments ( cameron , merkel , ... ) not only oppose schulz , but also the conservative junckers . 
  also : ` vote in the european parliamentary elections to keep those nasty europeans out ! ', 
  what logic is that ? 
   this would be an absolute disaster for the future of the european union . 
  disaster . 
  absolutly . 
  if the national governments do this and get away with it ( by the eu parliament caving in ) , i 'll lose the rest of my faith in the political system . 
  god , i hate that clickbait shit . 
  yes . 
  i would say the european court of justice , european investment bank and the efsf ( which oversees the european stability mechanism ) all qualify as important . 
  it 's not a technical issue . 
  there just absolutely no will among european politicians to start a manned space programme . 
  * minimum-preservability-date *, 
  1 ) i think it the `` surrender '' thing stems solely from ww2 . 
  france performed surprisingly bad in 1940 . 
  before the war the `` common wisdom '' was something like this : the british have the best fleet , germany the best airforce , france the strongest army . 
  2 ) the losing war parts is , i guess , very popular in the english speaking world as france and england were historic enemies for a long time . 
  the americans being culturally close to england just adopted that . 
  thanks to / r/polandball i 'll always remember that estonia can into nordic !, 
  i think it 's true that german ` tv comedians ' are all pure shit though . 
  that basically shows that the sanctions are just a window dressing and europe wo n't stand firm on anything substantial . 
  why ca n't we have some politicians with principles ? 
  is that asked too much ? 
  soo ... i * did n't down-vote you . 
  * am not conservative * liked the video also , whether you like or dislike a youtube clip is your call , but that does n't suddenly turn your personal preferences into a * ` progressive statement ' .

  i do n't usually give a crap about the songcontest so did n't watch it . 
  but of course that was * before * i knew we would win . 
  now feeling sad to have missed this important event . 
  more a message that the ~ ~ eurovision ~ ~ audience is a bunch of children . 
  fity, 
  * hug * next year i 'll bother to particpate in the televoting and vote for france , no matter what the song is !, 
  feeling better now ? 
  we are everywhere !, 
  what happened ? 
  first time we win since 1966 !,
