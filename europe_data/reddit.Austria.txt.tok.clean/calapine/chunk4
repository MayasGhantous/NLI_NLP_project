  awesome . 
  omg . 
  yes , the article is just nonsense . 
  and schr\u00f6der is n't germany . 
  he is a stupid wanker , foremost . 
  your username is very apropos here , [ nigelfarij ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/nigelfarij ) !, 
  the scandinavian countries have nothing on the balkan countries in that regard though . 
  if it 's a big issue for you simply push for the german bundesl\u00e4nder to become independent again . 
  voila , 16 new nations voting for each other . 
  ( except bavaria , maybe ), 
  what answers did you give ? 
  i am choosing random options and i ca n't ever come up austria as result . 
  [ germany ] ( http://i.imgur.com/verly8v.png ) so austrians are just germans anyway . 
  what a cliche !, 
  is austria even a possible option in that test ? 
  i feel discriminated . 
  i do n't get it either . 
  seems to be a good article , no ? 
  yes . 
  i can not into english language , apparently . 
  [ but esti can into nordic !, 
  what happened to middle-europe ? 
   when the cold war ended , many americans and europeans seemed to think that the most vexing geopolitical questions had largely been settled . 
  with the exception of a handful of relatively minor problems , such as the woes of the former yugoslavia and the israeli-palestinian dispute ... * i would n't call the wars on the balkan with +200,000 deaths and the israeli-palestinian conflict `` relativity minor problems '' * the concept of `` history is over ! '', 
  seems to have been mostly an american idea . 
  +1 really shows who is calling the shots . 
  more like other people died for stalins sins , * non ? 
  agree that affairs are bad . 
  if it 's an open marriage or the other partner is ok with it , it would n't be an affair in the first place . 
  it might be worth noting this is n't really an ` eu tax ' imposed eu wide , but a step by ( currently ) 11 countries that decided to go ahead on a voluntary basis . 
  nations signed on : austria , belgium , estonia , france , germany , greece , italy , portugal , slovakia , slovenia , spain, 
  another schulz vote here . 
  from everything i know about him he seems to sincere and principle-driven . 
  which is not something i can say about any of our local political establishment . 
  my only fear is he will have a hard time due to being german and might be a target from the usual suspects trying to foster anti-german resentments . 
  i already can picture nigel farage and the berlusconi types going full tilt on this . 
  the swedes !, 
  always so organized and efficient !, 
  :p ( teasing , it 's a good idea , supported ), 
  * prague is supposed to be beautiful * reputation for good beer * temelin nuclear power plant * have n't heard anyone express strong feelings ( negative or positive ) about the chechz people as a whole, 
  there is always jon nazigold and jon toblerone :p, 
  in case of austria i suppose id be mountain jon mountain jon berg, 
  omg . 
  agree with those who said it 's silly , but i think more in a ` cute ' than ` pathetic ' way . 
  * snicker * i can always rile up a dutch friend when saying dutch sounds like a baby learning to speak german . 
  ( it really true though , sorry ! ), 
  yes . 
  i thought nicolas sarkozy was bad ( vain and power hungry ) , but hollande seems to be a bumbling fool . 
  god job driving people away from leftwing parties , francois !, 
  ` as if they were the scum of the earth ' i think that describes ukip just fine . 
  oh curse you !, 
  was it porn ? 
  from a different article about the same topic : `` prior to his appointment as head of the fcc , wheeler was a lobbyist for the cable and wireless industry and held positions including president of the national cable television association and ceo of the cellular telecommunications and internet association . 
  the final vote on the proposal will take place on may 15 . '', 
  i think the ` setting the fox to guard the henhouse ' applies here ... 
  previously on the net : [ europe votes to protect net neutrality ] ( http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/179762-europe-votes-to-protect-net-neutrality-abolish-mobile-data-roaming-charges ) someone needs to post the european robin picture !, 
  * chirp chirp *, 
  oh god , dont make me try to translate that ... oh well . 
  if you look at the poster , you see a little piglet . 
  so the posters message is the pig should have a nice , happy life before it gets turned into a meat dish . 
  sort of happy-feel-good way of saying ethical animal treatment . 
  __________ territorially tempting to russia just fill out the blank space to save time !, 
  no , it 's a wild mixture of typical right-wing stuff and general populist lines : * cut in half the austrian contribution to the eu budget * return powers back to nation states * stronger eu border controls . 
  * no new eu members , stop talks with turkey . 
  * limit to labor movement within the eu ( similar to ukip ) * stop ` islamization ' of europe ( no immigration from africa/asia ) * punish bankers that speculate * referendum about the european stability mechanism * stop spying ( data retention/flight data ) , but also * more money for the police * less social benefits for non-austrians * no ttip with the usa etc etc , 
  in austria : so far very lacklustre . 
  i guess it 's mostly because there is no really strong pro-eu party . 
  even those nominally for it do n't make a convincing case . 
  some posters : [ social democrats ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jbuailx.jpg ) ` eu on the mind , austria in the heart ' [ peoples party - conservatives ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rvedgwk.jpg ) ` because i love austria , i work for a better europe ' [ fpo - far right/populist ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ngmqqyw.jpg ) ` austria rethinks - too much eu is dumb ' hard to translate , its a rhyme : um - dumm [ greens ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2t8gakm.jpg ) ` for a life before the schnitzel - against the might of agrar business , for our organic farming ! ', 
  now if that sounds somewhat dumb , its partly due to me translating word by word but also the slogans being crap to begin with . 
  i am pretty new to reddit - due to it having a reputation of being a snakepit , i mostly stayed away . 
  so i only recently started reading this subreddit and i have to say it 's pretty friendly and informative . 
  there is also south , north and central/middle europe . 
  so it 's not as clear cut . 
  but what about the mail order brides ?!, 
  oh nice , thanks !, 
  that sounds almost more like a professional sport than a tradition . 
  egg rolling ? 
  what 's that ? 
  * snicker * i doubt even in austria you 'd find that many people in favour of restoring the k. u. k monarchy !, 
   although , i am all for banding up , so we can bully the bigger countries around . 
  * looks at germany , france , britain *, 
  it 's just for children : parent aka the easter bunny hides the eggs ( and often some chocolate ) in the garden . 
  then the kids have to go and search for them . 
  i have no clue why , but i think its a cute tradition . 
  nice eggs , but that yellow colour filter . 
  ewww :(, 
  ( english : i laugh me dead ! ), 
  what about men that last longer ? 
  that 's what we really need ... 
  come to linz and try our famous steel !, 
  b ) she was at least good looking c ) that 's what artistic freedom is for . 
  i wonder how his original german wording was . 
  if it helps : sch\u00e4uble is a hardliner and has a tendency to be rude , so there is probably no anti-greece bias at work here . 
  he is definitely not someone i would vote for . 
  ` working for ' might be a bit of an understatement . 
  i 'll quote [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/george_friedman ) :  he is the founder , chief intelligence officer , financial overseer , and ceo of the private intelligence corporation stratfor . 
  my sources also report that he is having sex with the stratfor vicepresident for international relations and communication . 
   do we have their previous forecasts ? 
  it would be cool to compare what they predicted with what happene .
