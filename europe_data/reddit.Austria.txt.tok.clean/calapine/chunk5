  see the top post in this very thread : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2xh720/stratfors_forecast_for_europe_20152025/cp09p45, 
  you think he read his own book ? 
  if you put it that way you are right of course . 
  but still , i read a few reviews and it 's not something one should spend even 20 minutes on . 
  china , russia , eu , germany : unimportant poland , turkey : new continental powers 3rd world war : japan & turkey vs us etc. . . 
  thanks , but there is nothing tl ; dr about a 23 minute youtube clip ... 
  always with the nuking ... 
  paid ones are worse . 
  talking sincere poster you at least get a glimpse into the mind of people from a different country . 
  paid shills are only there to disrupt and muddy the waters . 
  you and me :p, 
   brigades of other ideologies what ` other ideology ' has paid shills using throwaway accounts on / r/europe ? 
  that 's because they all are siblings/cousins : 1 . 
  it started with the ` nato frigate replacement for the 1990 ' project , involving us , uk , france , germany , italy , canada , netherlands . 
  not long after the project fell apart due to irreconcilable differences . 
  uk , france , italy then started their own follow-up called : ` horizon cngf ' 1 . 
  germany , netherlands & spain likewise teamed up for the ` trilateral frigate cooperation ' programme . 
  us just did their own thing --  [ arleigh burke ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arleigh_burke-class_destroyer ) 1 . 
  not long after again the uk jumped ship from the horizon programme and also did their own thing . 
  --  [ type 45 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_45_destroyer ) 1 . 
  france and italy went on alone and the result was the --  [ horizon class . 
  the german-dutch-spanish saw the co-operation to the end as well , but allowed each nation greater freedom to configure to the load-out of their own ships , leading to 3 different ship classes : [ f124 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sachsen-class_frigate ) , [ de zeven provinci\u00ebn ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_zeven_provinci%c3%abn-class_frigate ) , [ \u00c1lvaro de baz\u00e1n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%81lvaro_de_baz%c3%a1n-class_frigate ) and as for how to tell them apart : the horizons have [ two guns on the bow , ] ( https://i.imgur.com/cwmlkfr.jpg ) just below the bridge . 
  that is pretty unusual and an immediate give-away . 
  honestly , i am starting to get scared . 
  the satellites themselves cost around 40m $ each . 
  the launch with soyuz around 80 $ million for a pair of two satellites .

  ** funfact : ** the * last * head of state to visit iran before the sanctions was president klestil . 
  / r/moldovancrisis has been waiting for this day !, 
  * how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  in general every day , with rare exceptions . 
  * how often do you visit / r/europe [ 2 ] ? 
  [ same as above . 
   ] ( https://i.imgur.com/2e9ww5k.png ) more than my posting history would suggest . 
  i enjoy reading a good back-and-forth argument but less so joining the fray myself . 
  * what country are you normally resident in ? 
  austria * do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  german , mother language * what interests you about europe ? 
  it 's my home . 
   i have an interest in ( geo ) politics and thus read lots of american media . 
  add to that the daily show and colbert report ( rip ) for entertainment . 
  one day i realized i could name more us politicians by heart than of my neighbouring eu countries . 
  the next thought was `` what am i missing ? '', 
  * what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  the wide range of people from different countries all speaking english . 
  that combination is special . 
  * do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  i helped moderate a raid-group forum for wow and a small eve corp forum . 
  both of which involved mostly administrate busy-work and less actual `` modding '' . 
  * why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  i 'd like to help my favourite subreddit . 
  * why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  hmm ... * i think i am pretty good at keeping my own opinions/biases separate from work . 
  * my approach to modding was ( is ) rather cautious . 
  in a borderline case i tend to in favour of not intervening or consulting a fellow mod first , rather than having to revert a unjustified mod action . 
  * my motivation would be doing a `` good job '' . 
  good in this context means for me a moderator who ( obviously ) follows the mod rules and more specifically a ) whose decisions are explainable ( `` why was my comment removed ? / what did i do wrong ? '', 
  deserves an accurate answer ) and b ) are consistent . 
  * personality wise i tend to be more submissive than confrontational . 
  so i can promise not to start any fights with the older mods  and have no problem following their lead . 
  * do you have any experience with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  not specifically , but i am wiling to learn . 
  * what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  i agreed with the idea behind it . 
  the implementation did n't really work . 
  the updates did n't keep up with the new content . 
  and forcing the discussions of many topically related but still different articles into one big thread was somewhat user-unfriendly . 
  the result was a sort of involuntary `` censorship '' by making participating ( new topics and following their discussions ) too cumbersome . 
  in hindsight i think a selectable topic-filter would probably have worked better . 
  * what 's one weakness you have ? 
  quite a few ? 
  one i noticed when re-reading this post is just how much my ability to express myself properly in english degrades when i am overly tired ( it 's 5:28 am ) . 
  :( * would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  hundred cute tiny horses , please . 
  * what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  explain why do i have to do this ??? 
  i am * reallly * sleepy . 
  i 'll answer the question tomorrow . 
  promised !, 
  the result is the same . 
  do you think refugees read the dublin treaty fine-print ? 
  and then this leads to more refugees coming and then you tell countries on the border on take up the burden . 
  that is going to be understood as refugees welcome . 
  and the result was predictable . 
  it 's an anti eu/anti west fringe site . 
  they once suggested the bundeswehr is training urban warfare to crush uprisings of eu citizens . 
  they also use authors/publications from the kopp verlag as source , a company that publishes books about how `` 9/11 was an inside job '' and other such conspiracies . 
  deutsche wirtschaftsnachrichten is a kook site with a fancy title to appear genuine . 
  do n't bother . 
  going to play a bit of shadowrun : hongkong . 
  ^ ( a bit = all day ), 
  and a nice setting and quick without much pain . 
  yes . 
  the original is french * litre * . 
  in german it 's * liter * too . 
  true , but pakistan , india and israel developed nuclear weapons as well , without being sanctioned . 
  try going cold turkey on food for a couple of weeks and then come again and tell me it 's not a drug . 
   vienna vienna is neither wet not bleak .
