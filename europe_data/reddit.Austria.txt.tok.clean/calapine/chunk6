  average precipitation per year is around 600 mm . 
  compare that to 837 mm for rome and 1184 mm for new york . 
   boeing has secured 2,831 orders for its 737 max plane , according to data on its website , while airbus said that it has over 4,100 orders for the a320neo with this order .

  i guess you are referring to the varoufakis `` hacking the finance ministry '' plan ? 
  i wiki-ed it . 
  presovo is a town , sandzak a region . 
  both are situated in the south of serbia and have a majority albanian respectively bosniak population . 
  ~ ~ so maybe the op is hinting towards some `` do what the eu tells you or those places will rise up and be liberated ! '', 
  threat-conspiracy ? ~ ~ ** edit : ** i do n't know what the op means and do n't want to put words in his mouth . 
  wow , that guy . 
  from the wiki page you linked :  two more incidents concern moda'i 's deputy ambassador , nurit tinari moda'i , who is also his wife . 
    in another incident , israel 's channel 10 tv station published an email sent by tinari moda'i to senior foreign ministry officials . 
  ** in it she offers that israeli expats living in ireland who are criticising israel , are doing so due to psychological and sexual identity problems , suggesting that they should be targeted and publicly embarrassed . 
  ** o.o, 
  let them . 
  if they moonies rebel we will turn the place into a lifeless rock full of craters !, 
   every amount of racism is too much . 
  yes . 
  and in the same way every murder that happens is one too many . 
  that does n't change the fact that germany is a pretty safe place for it 's citizens and neither does the existing racism mean that germany is * `` goddamn shithole , ruled by conservative assholes and inhabited by an ignorant , bigoted populace '' * . 
  you are far too negative . 
  i doubt the german police is much worse than austria or denmark . 
  let 's just agree that great minds think alike and we nations both have good taste in flags ? 
  fuck russia today , who cares what they think . 
  :p most is awesome, 
  i just [ posted the same ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g875f/german_trade_surplus_to_rise_to_new_record_in/ctvzi1x ) , even using the same countries as example . 
  before reading your comment , of course . 
  but if germany becomes less competitive it 's not going to be greece that fills the gap but countries like south korea , us , china , japan . 
  holding down germany does n't help europe, 
  next up : listening to music is basically just ripping a cd to your brain and thus illegal too . 
   a long fascinating read very long ... 
  i did n't know bloomberg does in-depth reporting . 
  but an interesting submission , thank you , 
  from the guardian article :  russia has stepped up its battle against parmesan cheese , danish bacon and other european delicacies , announcing it plans to incinerate contraband shipments on the border as soon as they are discovered . 
   according to footage shown on state television , authorities have already begun the process . 
  `` an operation to liquidate dozens of tons of contraband pork has taken place , '' a news anchor announced on tuesday evening , followed by footage of triumphant customs officials apparently unveiling a huge consignment of `` ukrainian '' pork fat that was actually a danish product with fake labels . 
  around 35 tonnes of pork , in blue containers , was thrown into incinerators . 
  brussels , eu quarter ? 
  we could pretend to be lobbyists !, 
   people do n't like coins , coins end up sitting around in jars because nobody wants to carry around bags full of metal . 
  1 and 2 $ coins are used lot and do n't sit around . 
  i have n't heard anyone complaining about them either in rl . 
  would n't russia be closer ? 
  i 'd like a 20 euro coin ... 
  imagine going out for dinner , have wine and dessert and then dropping a single euro coin on the table and saying * `` keep the rest !, 
   almost godwin 's law [ 1 ] - like every discussion about the eu , europe or its ' countries , will eventually lead to negative references about the usa . 
  negative stereotyping of the us from either side of the political spectrum in europe seems to be the norm . 
  not only here on / r/europe [ 2 ] but also in everyday 's life . 
  that premise is wrong , so this question :  why is even europe in need for `` casual '' anti-americanism ? 
  does n't make sense . 
  my question would be if there is sort of `` den of modded post '' that show everything that gets deleted or hidden . 
  would be nice to see along what lines moderation goes and how consist it is . 
  it 's eurobarometer . 
  probably the best cross countries surveys you get for any european topic . 
  [ eurobaromater methodology ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/description_en.htm ), 
  that 's ... poetic !, 
  why is it a forgone conclusion that russia has to veto an international mh 17 tribunal ? 
  what is their better alternative ? 
  i think the controversial flair is going to more controversial than the `` controversial '' discussion . 
  and there is no need for it either . 
  my vote would be for not implementing it . 
  edit : i meant not implementing it . 
  argh, 
  it 's been a tad too hot here ( 34 degree a lot of days ) but i really prefer hot summers too cold ones . 
  28 degree and sunny would be perfect imho, 
  and it was a greek who raped europa . 
  when will we get an official apology ?? 
  swedish and democratic . 
  sounds like a decent political party !, 
  where can i sign up ? 
  ^ ^ / s edit : i know what they are ... thus the / s, 
  i find the inter-eu transfers impressive , considering how little time european integration had . 
  we are not a single country , so the comparison is n't quite fair . 
  that 's not said there could n't been done more . 
   not the source of news for 99.92 % of the population . 
  fify source : number of / r/europe subscribers vs eu citizens , 
  same for austria . 
  basically every basic food is available as `` bio '' ( as we call it ) and `` normal '' variant , even in smaller supermarkets . 
  ca n't remember when i bought non-bio milk or eggs the last time even . 
  quick googling says 17 % of all farmers/food-producers produce organic food in austria . 
  i am reading the faz , am i doing it wrong ? 
  ( not that i would vote for cdu ever , even if i could ) . 
  ** edit : ** sueddeutsche and taz too . 
  but what other sort of left-ish quality news outlet is there ? 
  i used to read telepolis , but it turned into a conspiracy outlet imho . 
  agree . 
  i am sure it 's possible to find individual posts that are racist or xenophobic and actually i reported a racist youtube video ( called `` 28 years later '' ) a few days ago . 
  it was removed less than an hour after it went up . 
  but ... i do n't see those being anywhere near representative of the / r/europe in total . 
  if the op thinks that  `` neo-nazis are upvoted to the top while any voice of dissent is crushed '' i can only say we are not reading the same sub-reddit . 
  the wall , floor pattern radiate a distinct 70ies vibe . 
  not that anything is wrong with the 70ies .

  i tallied all likes / dislikes for countries to see how `` friendly '' they feel towards other nations in general . 
  country | + / - total -- | -- england | 338 greece | 2 france | 209 italy | 177 germany | 197 spain | 160 ** conclusion : ** greece needs hugs , not euros !, 
  but you * are * europeans !, 
  when are you ever going to learn that ? 
   quantity does n't equal quality .
