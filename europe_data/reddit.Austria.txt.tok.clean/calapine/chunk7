  i would n't be so sure . 
  what scares me is that every development in the us seems to find it 's way over here with 10 - 15 year delay . 
  you french seem more resistant in thid regard but in germany and austria it 's like there is no self confidence to reject such things . 
  ( not sure how to phrase this properly . 
  maybe someone more eloquent thsn me knows what i mean . 
   just to clarify , the finnish government and people in general are very happy to suck microsoft/silverlight/adobe flash dick . 
  ( this is just my personal bitter opinion . ), 
  hey !, 
  our government does the same . 
  * `` he uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp posts -- for support rather than illumination . 
   ireland did not outgrow the uk at all . 
  it did , check the source image i posted . 
  which was taken from : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_european_union#economies_of_member_states  also , we are comparing the post-crisis years to the state pre-crisis , 2007 . 
  you can do that , but narrowing a comparison to just a few years does n't result in anything that 's valid to judge wether a currency is good or bad . 
  comparing growth of former east-block countries that are catching up with countries that are already on the top ( denmark has 6th highest gdp/capita * worldwide * ) does n't make sense . 
  if we want to cherry pick the headline could also read : * how euro-slovakia outgrow non-euro czechia * how euro-ireland outgrew non-euro ~ ~ england ~ ~ uk * how euro-austria outgrew non-euro hungary . 
  austrians are really insular . 
  i am looking forward to punkrupt punners suicide jumping for their couches !, 
   the majority the majority definitely does n't use twitter or even follow it . 
  guardian is saying the opposite , the privatization fund is gone . 
  subtle !, 
  maybe edit your post to make it more readable ? 
  if you hit enter twice after a sentence this will create a paragraph .

  awww :(, 
   4 ) economically speaking , greece , italian , spanish , irish , portuguese , debts are what made germany ( and its `` satellite states '' ) rich . 
  they call it `` debtocracy '' : i gave you money and now i owe you . 
  `` they '' call that `` bullshit '' because it 's just plain not true . 
   3 ) economically speaking , it is not greece 's fault . 
  and the other countries know it . 
  corrupted politicians ? 
  yeah , sure . 
  but this would n't have been enough to reduce them in this state . 
  what has killed their economy was the currency : they suddenly could easily buy foreign stuff ( import + + ) ; as a price they destroyed their inner economy ( export -- ) . 
  economically speaking it 's their fault . 
  what caused the crisis was a years-long build up of ever higher debt levels . 
  something which had to collapse sooner or later . 
  even if one assumes that the euro had a negative effect / made the situation worse it was their will to join it , thus their fault . 
  i think the honest answer is that no one really knows exactly what consequences greece leaving the eu would have , so everyone is a bit afraid of it . 
  * shifting the blame on the eu and by that shaming them into a bailout ? 
  * and i am not even joking . 
  i read v 's book some time ago ( the global minotaur ) , he definitely is n't stupid ... there must be * some * plan ... 
  thanks !, 
  serious question at the thread-starter . 
  what are you exactly referring to with * `` edit : he took it back about 30 minutes later '' * i do n't really understand how he could take a statement like that back after half an hour . 
  did he claim to be mistranslated ? 
  say it was a joke ? 
  i guess you are joking , but if i had to choose between bitcoin and google shares i would take the latter ... 
  @op : / r/whatcouldgowrong and / r/holdmybeer might be interested in this as well !, 
  neither . 
  the ironic part is i am actually for a debt cut and further help in general , but after this charade i have * zero * trust in varoufakis / tsipras . 
   and seriously , we have 2200bn of debt . 
  having 2300bn instead wo n't break us . 
  but any future greek bailout will be carried by all euro members , not only germany . 
  countries like d. , austria and netherlands will be able to afford the extra debt , but italy and portugal ? 
  and what if the `` greece situation '' repeats with a country that 's bigger than them ? 
  let 's say italy ? 
  they might be as deserving but we know they wont get the same help because it would be unaffordable . 
  if that is your idea of the euro not only germany would leave but also netherlands , france , austria , estonia , belgium , slovakia , ... on the plus side the ecb would be moved to athens and greece would have 100 % control over it , being the sole member !, 
  that would lead to `` alien invasion scenario '' in which the entire world puts their differences aside and joins together to fight a common enemy . 
  ^ / s * greece , you are of genius !, 
  thank you !, 
   media did missinterpret him , malis or not . 
  that 's what ** he ** claims now . 
  the same guy that said in the last days that greek bank deposits are save and that the referendum is sure not to lead to an euro exit . 
  just wait until you hear about ** gremain ** also , how does one do big font on reddit ? 
   except that round of austerity literally brought down the regime and caused the leader and his wife to be executed in a kangaroo court . 
  politicians being put against the wall might not be a bad thing ... 
   according to an economic espionage order , the nsa intercepted all french corporate contracts and negotiations valued at more than $ 200 million in many different industries , such as telecommunications , electrical generation , gas , oil , nuclear and renewable energy , and environmental and healthcare technologies . 
    a second economic espionage order called `` france : economic developments '' shows that information was then shared with other u.s. agencies and secretaries , including the secretary of energy , the secretary of commerce , the federal reserve and the secretary of treasury . 
  eventually , this data could have been used to help sign export deals . 
  wow ... 
  that 's a trick question , is n't it ? 
  in other countries the public opinion and especially the eu-sceptic parties would blame greece though . 
  that 's actually one of austria 's far-right party 's `` argument '' : `` the eu is sending our money to prop up lazy southerners !, 
   if they print euros they can print rubles , yuan , us-dollars as well . 
  they should do the latter part . 
  if they get caught of course the eu wont have known anything about it ... ^ / s, 
  greek military budget was 4008 million euro in 2014 according to sipri . 
  or 2.2 % of gdp . 
  even with a 10 % reduction that would be a higher share of gdp than most eu countries . 
  and what for ? 
  to defend against albania ( lol ) or another nato member ? 
  according to this [ article ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000018181050/dokument-die-eu-kommission-an-das-griechische-volk ) ( in german ) the eu side asked for 400 million $ reduction in defence spending . 
  greece negotiators would only agree too 200 million . 
  so a leftist government is trying to protect the bloated military spending , all the while v. talks about being humiliated by the eu . 
  way to go syriza .

  `` shocking revelation : microsoft ai posing as / r/europe mod ! '', 
  this sounds like an attempt to make something appear sinister :  `` in greece , certain individuals who work for the mass media were contracted to conceal the fact that the greek debt was not sustainable . ''   roumeliotis claimed that many journalists were victims of misinformation and the omission of the fact that the debt was not sustainable was detrimental to the public interest . 
  he further said that several economists and university professors attempted to convince the public that the debt was sustainable , adding that he puts them in the same category as the journalists . 
  ie : if you do n't agree with our line that we need another haircut you are either misinformed or contracted to mislead the public . 
  happy birthday !, 
  for big launchers like ariane and small satellites like this weight it 's volume , not weight that will be the limiting factor . 
  900 satellites over 20 inclination planes , of which 300 are initially spares . 
  so let 's say 600 , that makes 30 sats per plane , thus at least 30 starts , assuming the ariane 5 fairing has enough space for them all ( not sure ) .
