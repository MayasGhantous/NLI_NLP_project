  much more launches if something smaller like vega is used . 
  awesome !, 
  i use ^ ^ as well , but i thought it was a japanese thing ... ? 
   to be honest , if one of our direct neighbors invades us , i would be okay with that . 
  what about us ? 
  exactly , yes . 
  can i vote for you ? 
  i would n't want us ( austria ) to join nato , but if russia attacks any eu member i would be in favour of military help . 
  ideally we could have an european security alliance as part of the eu . 
  the `` support nato '' question would probably have been answered more positively if had been clear it was in case of an invasion started by russia and not just any `` serious military conflict '' . 
  i think after the bush 's iraq war a lot of people read `` support nato '' as `` help us take over another country '' . 
  no , the article is correct . 
  airbus will get the entire cnes stake ( 34.68 % ) , which together with their current holdings will put them at ~ 75 % . 
  if you look at the wikipedia page again you will see that a lot of the `` different '' shareholder companies are actually owned by airbus . 
  for example : * 11.59 % - astrium gmbh = airbus subsidiary * 16.85 % - astrium sas = airbus subsidiary * 2.04 % - eads casa = airbus subsidiary * 1.95 % - dutch space vc = airbus subsidiary airbus total = 32.43 % safran = 10.57 % airbus-safran now = 43 % airbus-safran + cns shares = 77.68 %, 
  as i said ib / r/arianespace , i dont like this . 
  things like space should be a common good for the european people , not run by a for profit multinational . 
   even austria could learn a lesson or two from it . 
  and that 's a country which convinced the world that hitler was german , germany started ww1 and beethoven was austrian . 
  i am * soo * tired of that clich\u00e9d line . 
  those filters ...  .  * russia , ukraine * bad traffic in paris * omg brexit, 
  sooo ... anyone still want to claim that slapping heads of government is bad ? 
  wow , austria is fifth on that list . 
  more than summer holiday locations like greece , portugal , etc. . . 
  positively surprised , 
  he he ... do n't worry , nothing interesting ever comes out of faymanns mouth . 
  i see you have billa too . 
  ** psa ** : do n't shop there , it 's expensive . 
  go to [ hofer/aldi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aldi ) . 
  cheaper and no `` need to have a customer-card to get receive discounts '' crap . 
   radical left politics are considered a joke . 
  fixed it for you  to clarify : i am talking about fringe left , not left-wing politics in general . 
  like the communist student groups in austria , who split up in 2 separate parties , both about 4 % strong . 
  or our kp\u00d6 ( communist party ) which still had a strong stalinist wing in the ** 80ies ** !, 
   evolution is a lie . 
  they are all cavemen in uniforms . 
  maybe tune down the hyperbolic rhetoric a bit ? 
  aside from that , of course is no * single * action that can stop illegal immigration and other measures are needed as well . 
  what 's your solution ? 
  argentina would be preferable to china ... 
  what 's next ... ? 
  * bnd spying on merkel for the nsa ? 
  * bnd spying on [ mad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/milit%c3%a4rischer_abschirmdienst ) for the nsa ? 
  thatcher and hussein both there . 
  it 's like the meeting of histories greatest monsters !, 
  3rd place for that place called `` oostenrijk '' ... * snicker * ... not bad . 
  it 's the only thing that could help . 
  the german government will try to sit this out again ... 
  nah , nothing is going to happen . 
  just wait and see . 
  not sure i want a [ great leap forward ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_leap_forward ) happening in europe ... 
  in upper austria we consider vienna as balkan . 
  the article is very france-specific . 
  does anyone know if this ruling will have any affect on similar regulations in other countries ? 
  i am all for brexit with screntry !, 
  prices in * dollar per gallon * ??!, 
   i ca n't wait until rand becomes president * h\u00f6h\u00f6 * i think your grip on reality is slipping ... 
  funny , to me dutch often sounds like a baby-speak version of german . 
  someone is very mad :  the declaration issued by the austrian parliament will leave permanent stains on turkish-austrian friendship . 
   the declaration [ ... ] the austrian parliament is cause for great resentment on our part . 
  quotes from the official response of the turkish parliament . 
  because it is still being downplayed / denied by the perpetrator country . 
   his candor is pretty refreshing , if anything . 
  her candor . 
  the defense minister is ursula von der leyen . 
   as of july 1 , a person found guilty of having had sexual relations with an animal will face fines or prison terms . 
  you still have about two months time ... 
  hurry !, 
  speak : * english * german * a few words of french would like to : * french * something else once i mastered french . 
  i like the middle one with europa ( the person ) . 
  does n't feel kitschy imho . 
  sadly i do n't have that confidence at all . 
  especially austrian politicians are known for just falling over in international negotiations . 
  i am pleasantly surprised . 
  btw , the parliamentary resolution also mentions the k. u. k. monarchy 's responsibility as ally of ottoman turkey . 
  * no way . 
  better you than van der leyen !, 
  personally i 'd want britain in the eu , but not this britain in it 's tory-right wing anti-integrationist stance . 
  it 's an interesting question what would be better for the eu in the long run . 
  even later posts can be snarky , imho . 
  and as bad as a shooting is , the thought od someone running amok with medieval weapons gave me a guilty grin . 
  maybe teachers should wear chainmail from now on ? 
   the thing with zionism is that it can have totally different meanings to different people . 
  so zionism = feminism ? 
  this would explain some things ... 
  it does n't have to be an endpoint . 
  remember that 2030 is only 15 years in the future . 
  that 's a bit too soon to have a full fledged federation by then . 
  ( although personally i would prefer something a bit more loose . 
  confederacy type setup ) . 
  why do europeans seem to be so negative ( judging from this thread ) . 
  i am sure if you asked the same question in a chinese subreddit the outlook would be much more bright . 
  the statement is a bit dick-waggy , but maybe europe needs to be reminded sometimes that we are n't all weak and helpless . 
  more sad than silly , really . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqbdmckgtuu ) is the video . 
  it looks like they hired pedo bear as lead in for the act . 
  how fitting . 
  o.o ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ am ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ joking ... 
  * blush * why thanks , we like you too !, 
  ^ ^ sorry ^ ^ about ^ ^ the ^ ^ temelin ^ ^ hysterics ...
