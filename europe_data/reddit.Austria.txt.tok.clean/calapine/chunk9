  no , the big country to the north ... 
  see the german wikipedia page on mitteleuropa . 
  it shows a few different sources/definitions for term . 
  [ stagn ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/grossgliederung_europas.png ) [ brockhaus ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/central_europe_%28brockhaus%29.png ) [ meyers ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/central_europe_%28meyers_grosses_taschenlexikon%29.png ), 
  you want to join the uk ? 
  i feel a bit ashamed to say it ... :(, 
  i would agree with him on the definition . 
  that we still think of it as ` east ' is a result of tge cold war , where poland was really in another world , do to speak . 
  the borders of what we call ` mitteleuropa ' are a bit fuzzy on the edges , but basically every definition includes poland . 
  yes , i am having the same issues with that question . 
  hmmm . 
  gibraltar as an austrian bundesland ... ? 
  it could work ... 
   a bug that may have sent cookies . 
  [ ... ] this was not our intention ahh , the classic `` it 's a bug not a feature '' excuse !, 
   does your country use the euro ? 
  yes  what do you think of the euro ? 
  i like it . 
   how would you like to improve the euro ? 
   do you think the euro will still be around 20 years ? 
  yes , hopefully . 
  but muh territory !, 
  / s the italians have so much coast line anyway . 
  they should give triest back ... 
  seriously : the only people that have a real right to complain are east europeans . 
  `` all the rooms are high ceiling '' i am sold . 
  the last 100 years were n't kind . 
  are you sure ? 
  440 lei should be about 22 euro . 
  it 's seems legally they have no leg to stand on . 
  at least according to the faz . 
  yes , i forgot to mention georgia . 
  i guess there is no easy solution ... 
  well , do n't leave us hanging . 
  what was so bad about ferdinand vii ? 
  what did he do ? 
  etc. . etc. . 
  iran  azerbaijan  black sea would be the same length and cut out erdogan 's turkey . 
  probably safer in the long run ... 
  i wish i had your calm distance . 
  the `` everyone needs to speak english ! '', 
  attitude from some british posters here * really * grates me . 
  definitely not . 
   this means doing away with interpretation at press conferences yes , because everyone speaks english here . 
  but i guess people do n't need to know what their politicians decide for them anyway . 
  i have the feeling albania and kosovo are just going to be a headache for europe for the next 20 + years . 
  i am aware of that . 
   in a few months the sun wo n't set until around 22:30 ish in nw spain . 
  i f ` ing hate utc +1 and dst . 
  that is bad ? 
  i am actually feeling a bit jealous that you have sun so long, 
   why do n't we turn the clock by 1/2 hour and stay put , instead of jumping around every fall and spring ? 
  loss of half hour of sunlight , i think , is not such a big deal . 
  that would be the worst possible solution , imho . 
  at least now when dealing with time zones it 's ( mostly ) in full hour increments . 
  a pet peeve of mine : people say they `` hate dst '' and in the next breath argue `` lets keep summer time all year '' . 
  the people who argue for this actually want a time zone change , which is totally different . 
  i like dst . 
  not because of any supposed energy savings , but for the extra sunlight in summer . 
  til : communist romania was a shopping paradise, 
  you have an interesting posting history : / r/coontown / / r/whiterights / r/whiteidentity / r/niggervideos, 
  not quite there yet . 
   from wiki :  areva estimated that the full cost of building the reactor would be about $ 8.5 billion [ olkiluoto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olkiluoto_nuclear_power_plant ), 
   olkiluoto is going to be the most expensive building in the world erdogan is going to take this as a challenge and build himself a new presidential palace :p ( edit : i am aware olkiluoto is a power plant ), 
  what was supposed to come next ? 
  i am not sure if that 's true . 
  unlike austrians the germans understand the concept of driving on the right side of the autobahn and only switch to a left lane for overtaking someone . 
  the typical austrian stays permanatly on the left side , while only driving 10 km/h faster than the right lane and only clears the lane when you drive really close up . 
  and some do n't even get the message then . 
  sadly i agree with the assessment in your last sentence . 
  i am all for tighter cooperation in europe , but i fear this is a minority view . 
  [ can you guess ? 
  what flag is that on your flair ? 
   i believe i really deserve a night with a high-end escort and some blow . 
  hmmm ... maybe there is a way we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement and get both what we want ? 
  i am not the op , but are you sure he referred to crime when saying ` straighten out ' ? 
  it can also be seen as a way to install civic duty inyo people . 
  like the idea of a ( non-military ) ' , social year ' that everyone has to do . 
  yes , let 's start dismantling all the achievements it took us 50 years for . 
  btw , . unknown people entering the country represents a `` huge security problem '' too . 
  we should introduce some sort of mandatory checkpoints at the borders , where people have to identify themselves and.can be searched for dangerous goods ... 
  it 's the only way to prevent terrorism . 
  i think it 's both actually . 
  some are evil , others stupid, 
  the brits themselves to a degree . 
  and it 's infuriating , just because you are on an island does n't mean you are n't european . 
  stop fooling yourself about having a special relationship with the us , adopt the euro and start driving on the correct side . 
  ie : shut up and get on with the.programme :p, 
  there are a lot of people in need within europe as well . 
  even in austria . 
  some people there are so poor that they wo n't be able to play witcher 3 , because they ca n't afford the high-end gpu hardware needed to run it . 
  these people suffer silently every day , their only entertainment being polandball comics and downvoting eurosceptic brits . 
  it 's really sad and tragic and something that should be pointed out once . 
  imho . 
  how * american * ... 
  thanks for the answer though . 
  the original eu observer article : https://euobserver.com/news/128217 the / r/europe thread for it : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3116fv/france_to_sell_mistral_warships_to_eu/, 
  can you expand on that please ? 
  who or what got `` cleaned up '' ? 
  i am proud to have downvoted you .
