  as far as i understand this : they would take back unregistered migrants , that are from lets say greece , and send one syrian refugee from turkey to eu . 
  sounds crazy ... and maybe it is : edited last point for clarity, 
  no agreement today lets recap : * turkey demands $ 6bn until the end of 2018 * visa-free travel to the eu for turkish citizens * and accelerated talks on turkey 's eu membership * turkey would take in one refugee from the greek islands in exchange for europe agreeing to take a syrian directly from turkey, 
  no agreement today lets recap : * turkey demands $ 6bn until the end of 2018 * visa-free travel to the eu for turkish citizens * and accelerated talks on turkey 's eu membership * for each syrian migrant now in the eu that turkey takes back , europe will resettle one syrian now in turkey . 
  derstandard.at is kind of leftist media and proud supporter of the willkommenskultur , however this article seems legit, 
  * autotranslated : * at the eu summit , the immediate termination of the illegal flow of migrants and the through wave to germany shall be declared a top priority of eu policy . 
  this emerges from a the standard present draft . 
  athens must immediately 50,000 places for potential asylum realize greece gets `` any help '' the union . 
  migrants with no chance of asylum should also be deported immediately to turkey . 
  the eu summit with turkey on monday in brussels and subsequent meetings of the 28 heads of state without the turkish premier ahmed davutoglu is expected to bring a dramatic change in the current policy and in dealing with refugees and migrants . 
  this is at least the result of a yet secret declaration that saturday evening was coordinated between the government headquarters in the capital cities . 
  in the paper , which is pending before standard , it literally means : `` the irregular flow of migrants along the west balkan route comes to an end this route is closed from now . . '' ** fine tuning still needed ** the final declaration of the eu-28 will be voted on today in brussels in the group of eu ambassadors still fine . 
  at the core of the decisions will , however , change anything , according to diplomatic sources . 
  many of the measures that will be implemented immediately after the meeting train to train , based on agreements to be concluded with the turkish side . 
  despite the excitement about the actions of the turkish government against an opposition newspaper on friday , the storm of the editorial by police , you go in brussels expect that davutoglu will appear on monday and negotiated in recent days agreements are then confirmed . 
  ** repatriation agreements planned with turkey ** nuclear case will be that turkey immediately constructively participates in controlling the eu 's external borders in the aegean and those migrants who can not hope to seek asylum in europe , will resume in the course of recycling . 
  the plan is a private repatriation eu-turkey agreement , which should be in force from 1 june . 
  before that you will operate on the basis of the bilateral agreement of greece . 
  as reported , also the eu-turkey action plan be promoted . 
  the eu member states undertake the special summit to the resettlement - to start - the direct settlement of syrian refugees from turkey in eu countries . 
  with regard to the measures in the area of union , in forceful language describes the explanation of the government a package of measures to be set in the coming weeks . 
  to the consequences of closing the balkan route , catch the jam thousands incoming refugees , the eu agreed to `` do the utmost to assist greece in this difficult moment . '', 
  if it were `` a collective responsibility of the community , which requires fast and efficient mobilization of all available resources '' , but `` also the contributions of the member states '' . 
  ** a billion for refugee assistance ** the arenberg by the european commission last week `` emergency plan '' for humanitarian aid is unconditional support of the government . 
  for 700 million euros have been earmarked , 300 million in 2016 . 
  the council of ministers should decide the plan before the next eu summit on march 18 and take shape , according to the statement . 
  together with all previously agreed measures so could be invested in aid to refugees in the coming months about one billion euros from the eu . 
  ** strengthen frontex ** the second major issue is security . 
  the eu will send over their border protection agency frontex once more officials to greece , which will be based on the borders with macedonia and albania . 
  they should also ensure that the reception centers ( hotspots ) function in greece , where the refugees are first recorded and prepared for the allocation of eu countries where they are to get proper asylum procedure . 
  until later than 1 april , the eu countries should make more , going beyond existing commitments officials for frontex available . 
  europol is to strengthen the fight against smuggling . 
  in march summit in ten days , the progress will be evaluated . 
  ** divide refugees in eu countries ** until then , the government hope under its declaration to the fact that the hitherto has come in transition `` distribution program '' of 160,000 refugees works on the member states . 
  it is apparently planned with regard to states not in eastern europe , that not all countries have the same time by starting with the `` relocation '' . 
  for in the secret document is also talk that some states are encouraged to voluntarily offer higher rates of refugees as provided . 
  in any case , the burden on greece would be alleviated if more immigrants coming into the country . 
  finally , the eu summit will ensure that by the end to `` a back to schengen '' is coming . 
  until then , no later than intended in accordance with the recent proposals of the european commission which checks at internal borders , as they are currently conducted in eight states , again belonging to the past . 
  ( thomas mayer from brussels , 03/05/2016 ), 
  watched it also ... it is really impressive how dedicated and straighforward her thinking is , kudos for that . 
  merkel is fully committed to one plan and there is no other way around . 
  if it works out ? 
  i hope so but i have a bad feeling about it . 
  good luck with that, 
  dont panic the eu is preparing the emergency plan right now . 
  welcome to europe, 
  in fact nothing changed so far , there was just official announcement that the germans sent no info about closure to our govnmt and they are still not expecting this to happen soon . 
  autotranslated : bavaria police stations along the border with austria - lower bavaria , upper bavaria and swabia south south / west - prepare for information the passauer neue presse before the introduction of border controls . 
  specifically loud the order to make the necessary preparations for the case of a - still pending - arrangement to control all border crossings within a few hours , learned the pnp . 
  it is intended to ensure that checks are carried out on all transitions . 
  in passau have been made at several of the previous five inner-city border crossings photos and studies on current spatial situation . 
  whether actually re general border controls are introduced , will depend on march 7 the outcome of the eu-turkey summit . 
  in the case of the reintroduction of border controls , to general again concretely be exercised by the eu legal options , rejected refugees at the border to austria as a safe third country . 
  this is `` inevitable '' , said the domestic policy spokesman for the cdu parliamentary group , stephan mayer ( csu ) , our newspaper . 
  on the balkan route currently arrive hardly refugee . 
  according to serbia may now only 500 migrants per day travel on this road to austria and germany . 
  macedonia has largely sealed off the border before days . 
  in germany and austria , the number of refugees therefore go sharply . 
  in greece , the situation is more dramatic contrast . 
  on the mainland , more than 25,000 people are on the way to the border . 
  greece accuses austria of having driven the blockade . 
  in an interview with the news magazine `` der spiegel '' has bavarian prime minister horst seehofer ( csu ) supported the research of the pnp . 
  he chancellor angela merkel ( cdu ) insistently demanded a departure from the previous policy on refugees : `` the more we realize that the european solution is not moving forward , the more we need to set national measures , `` seehofer said . 
  in concrete terms , the `` control our national borders and rejection of refugees . '', 
  `` our magnet is germany , '' he says ... that seems to be the case for half afghanistan right now, 
  ok thanks , not implying anything more than above said, 
  oh you feel responsible , i ask because it is very interesting how different everyone ( ! ), 
  here have a biased view just depending on the physical location, 
  * irony off, 
  psssscht no one wants to hear that, 
  may i ask from which country are you ? 
  thanks, 
  you are right , schengen seaborder especially south is a big problem and should have never existed , eu will try to fix this soon . 
  wasnt it only merkel and speaking for germany ? 
  austria border is still open ( but with limits like germany ) edit : dont rely on media regarding border crossing information , this here keeps updated in all the details : http://live.w2eu.info, 
  i have honestly no idea . 
  and yes it is really sad but far right is rising in austria , also in germany and several other eu countries . 
  the people are really frustrated and feel betrayed by the current governments . 
  greece never acted as a country with eu external border , there was basically no effective registration and still isnt . 
  most asylum seekers only want to germany , austria or maybe sweden . 
  austria is the first country where refugees arrive that may be interesting to seek asylum , while austria accepted 90.000 asylum requests in 2015 , it may be surprising that it will not accept the same number 2016 . 
  keep in mind how most of the other countries in this wonderful european unity are handling this . 
  germany takes no unlimited number of refugees per hour and refugee numbers arriving in greece are rising . 
  and dont forget the ultimatum made for by eu leaders ( germany as well ) if greece dont get it under control . 
  faymann/tsipras bromance is officially over now . 
  a year ago tsipras said he finally found a friend within eu . 
  :( http://www.thelocal.at/20150209/greeces-tsipras-in-vienna-for-friendly-meeting, 
  maybe , but this is more or less what he said `` in the next 10 days we need tangible and clear results on the ground otherwise there is the risk the whole system will completely break down , '' dimitris avramopoulos told reporters after a meeting of eu interior ministers in brussels .
