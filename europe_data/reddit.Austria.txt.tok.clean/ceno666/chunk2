  right now here in europe every country below another country is a scapegoat . 
  actually greece is the most tragic scapegoat of them all ... sitting alone underneath so much scapegoats . 
  de maizi\u00e8re said if their plan do not work `` other measures will be necessary '' ... whatever this means, 
  it was greece ` s job and they failed , the eu tried it to fix together with greece the last months and it is still not working . 
  can we blame them ? 
  i am not so sure , europe as a whole is completely overwhelmed with the situation and it seems this will not change in the near future . 
  let me explain why this happens right now : greece never acted as a country with eu external border , there was basically no effective registration and still isnt . 
  most asylum seekers only want to germany , austria or maybe sweden . 
  all the evil countries you refer to have one in common , they lie en route north . 
  austria is the first country where refugees arrive that may be interesting to seek asylum , while austria accepted 90.000 asylum requests in 2015 , it may be surprising that it will not accept the same number 2016 . 
  keep in mind how most of the other countries in this wonderful european unity are handling this . 
  germany takes no unlimited number of refugees per hour and refugee numbers arriving in greece are rising . 
  and dont forget the ultimatum made for by eu leaders ( germany as well ) if greece dont get it under control . 
  the rather critical factor is what the deal with turkey brings in a few days . 
  because greece presence at such meetings dont matters a lot ? 
  i understand that it is disappointing for them but greece proved its inability more than enough . 
  * this is a duplicate thread btw . 
  are you really surprised by this decision ? 
  because greece presence at such meetings dont matters a lot ? 
  i understand that it is disappointing for them but greece proved its inability more than enough . 
  read the full article , the headline is a bit misleading, 
  in fact germany sends asylum seekers back over the austrian border every day , even before anyone en route started registering, 
  thanks for the infos !, 
  source ?

  as far as i know there are no deportations to north african countries like marocco , algeria . 
  afganistan , unsecure as well . 
  syria , war zone . 
  to where exactly ? 
  europe goes basically into full fortress mode and greece serves as the waiting room for millions of refugees , not that i want this but it is my pessimistic vision . 
  there is no workable solution possible because of the fundamental dissent between eu members and it seems that this will not change soon . 
  i find this objective [ article ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000031590052/merkels-mannschaft-flattern-die-nerven ) very interesting , you should know this is from a rather `` leftist '' austrian media that supported the `` willkommenskultur '' . 
  even they arrived in reality , finally . 
  the same as last year . 
  a minority will apply for asylum in austria , the rest will find its way uncontrolled through the country up to the german border because they want to germany . 
  what do you think will happen next ? 
  i think the same as last year , germany allow few per hour cross over the at/de border and the rest will have to wait and pile up in austria . 
  lets stop blaming each other , there is no quick and friendly solution to the refugee crisis ... 
  you really think they are deported back ? 
  collapse incoming, 
  europe ** is ** in deep shit and it will get far deeper, 
  germany will turn around soon as well . 
  do you know that during peak times there are lots of thousands refugees waiting in austria near german border , they want to germany , nothing else . 
  austria dont want to go over capacity to care about all those waiting people , it happened before last year several times . 
  and if you think austria is a bad boy and takes no refugees , check the statistics again ... and keep in mind it is a little smaller then germany . 
  but but we are victims !, 
  * irony off, 
  there are limits per hour , according to the processing capacity . 
  regardig sending hundreds per day back : [ asylum seekers sent back from germany are primarily from afghanistan , morocco , algeria or syria and are generally rejected because they are unable to prove their identity or because they are planning to move on to scandinavia and therefore unwilling to register in germany , according to austrian police . 
  ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/germany-sending-200-refugees-per-day-back-to-austria-migration-border/ ), 
  our government just started days ago to act independend ... in fact we were basically controlled by germany on every decision regarding austrian borders during the asylum crisis . 
  lets see how this insubordination turns out . 
  yes , there are german limits since months . 
  it gets funnier every day ... and in this position for this country and talking about `` sending wrong signals '' hahahaha, 
  who is saying austria doesnt care about refugees that are in the country ? 
  no it was noble to save the day back then but germany should have stopped pretending `` wir schaffen das '' at some point to slow down the whole migration stream . 
  just see what happens next http://m.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article152400440/fluechtlingstransport-bis-zur-deutschen-grenze-vereinbart.html, 
  one word : willkommenspolitik, 
  if most of the eu members would work together it could be done . 
  but no chance in this reality . 
  you are funny , this cap taking effect in the next big wave , of course . 
  because you seem to be competent and informed on numbers i am pretty sure you know how much migrants germany let in per day lets say during oct or nov 2015 . 
  please rethink what you are writing here . 
  +1 you nailed it !, 
  no , this is about the amount of people that can be managed to bring them up over the german border per day , they only let them in when seekers ask for asylum in a neighbor state ( germany of course ), 
   which country will allow itself to turn into europe 's refugee camp ? 
  and now imagine what happens when germany introduce a limit or even close their border . 
  i am pretty sure this day will come , sooner or later . 
  you should check [ this ] ( http://www.w2eu.info/dublin2.en/articles/dublin2.en.html ) out according to the dublin regulation , you can only apply for refugee status in one member state . 
  usually , this is the first member state which you reach . 
  in practice this normally means that any subsequent country where you apply will return you to the appropriate state . 
   austria was sucking merkel 's dick `` while pointing fingers towards orban '' i may add, 
  eu is a victim of eu members !, 
  [ english translation ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.apa.at%2fnews%2f6328263814%2feu-fuerchtet-humanitaere-krise-wegen-oesterreichs-obergrenze.html&amp;edit-text= )  at the brussels meeting , among others also participated european council president donald tusk , european commission president jean-claude juncker and a representative of the dutch eu presidency . 
  the general consensus at the meeting : ** `` slovenia is a victim of austria '' ** ... let the bashing begin !, 
  imho no one can outdo merkel when it comes to pro-immigration, 
  currently germany let around 2000 in per day and send around 200 immediately back over the austrian border . 
  i have read germanys limit for asylum claims on south border is 3500 . 
  from this friday we only let 3200 per day in that will pass upwards ... hey it will be only 1.011.200 this year !, 
  the big question now : what about germany ? 
  around 7k 2014 and 14k 2015 were positive edit : here is a statistic about yearly asylum claims http://medienservicestelle.at/migration_bewegt/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/asylantraege_1999_2015.jpg, 
  80 asylum claims per day , yes, 
  executive criticizes german back thrusts either , these migrants try again cross the border illegally to come to germany , or they apply for asylum with us - with little chance of a positive decision '' https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.at&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://mobil.krone.at/ng/phone/kmm__1/app__core/sendung_id__32/story_id__495810/story.phtml&amp;usg=alkjrhhan9pjq4a-zs7d7hetgqxbmve7yg, 
  thanks for the infos, 
  need to correct that . 
  germany sent 3723 maroccans , algerians , egyptians , during january back over the border to austria . 
  no one knows what to do with them . 
  it is hopeless to ask faymann , he still believes the eu solution is on the horizon, 
  i kid you not , officials announced today that austria sends immediately 7 ( seven ) policemen to macedonia . 
  but hey , others may follow . 
  http://live.w2eu.info should be updated soon regarding the new routes, 
  imminent chain reaction, 
  chancellor faymann listens only to merkel ... it seems that stopped . 
  and they replaced our minister of defence some weeks ago . 
  it is happening, 
  the attack took place on december 2 , but police said they did not release details to `` protect the victim '' . 
  tl : dr turkey now wants 5 billion euros instead the previously agreed 3 billion euros . 
  sure you linked the right article ? 
  i think you mean the case from linz that emerged today http://ooe.orf.at/news/stories/2753634/ tl : dr : north-african was masturbating near the kids-pool edge while touching a 6 year old boy on the shoulder, 
  the countries on the route are now trying to block migrants from safe countries because they recently can not seek asylum in austria or germany .
