let 's just say that people that are fans of h.c. strache on facebook and comment on his posts are n't usually the brigthest people around ... 
  oh , go back to / r/conspiracy ... 
  well , i 'd rather spend my time discussing things with people that have a basic knowledge about a topic - which you clearly lack in this aspect . 
  all you do is to write in completely misguided stereotypes like  if you practice the actual mesages of islam ** you can only be ** what we know of as hardcore `` islamists '' and that is not worthy of further discussion . 
  you really do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  you do n't have to be a leftist to identify a deranged person ... 
  `` a bit suspect '' https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/pamela-geller, 
  pamela geller is a lunatic , nothing more , nothing less . 
   and once they 're settled in , their kids are born and go to school and say they 've lived all their life in your country , only know your culture and only speak your language , are you going to kick them back to their country ? 
  so they have fully integrated into the culture of their host country ? 
  why would you want to send such people back ? 
  and if you actually try do argue with the worst of them , you can be certain that the downvotes will drown you shortly after , which makes the whole exercise even more pointless . 
  i 've pretty much stopped commenting here - i downvote all the idiotic posts and leave it at that . 
  austrian 's fp\u00d6 is certainly far right . 
  and there 's a chance that they 'll be in the ruling coalition after the next elections . 
  the press seems to favor brexit ... 
  that comic strip is so ... perfect . 
  that seems a lot more respectable , yes . 
  thank you !, 
   so what is your point ? 
  four random more than a year old articles ? 
  this is your proof ? 
  according to this logic , every news channel in the world sucks . 
  alright then . 
   btw , this year in february the swedish bonnier group , bonnier family is one of the most prestigious publishing houses in europe , has acquired a majority stake in the deutsche wirtschafts nachrichten . 
  their tactic is quite successful , getting them lots of page views from social media . 
  all that without having all that pesky cost of actual reporters or factcheckers and so on makes them quite profitable , i 'd assume . 
  a good investment , if money is your main goal . 
  axel springer is also super successful , but that does n't mean that bild or welt are n't astonishingly bad papers . 
    the main author what does it mean ? 
  the site founder & owner . 
  not really all that hard to unterstand , is it ? 
  `` deutsche wirtschaftsnachrichten '' is by no means a news source that anybody should read - they outright lie & fabricate stuff to get as many clicks , and thus ad revenue as possible . 
  nothing on there can be taken at face value . 
  also , this is not about ukraine - or russia-bashing . 
  the main author of deutsche wirtschaftsnachrichten actually also runs another page called `` deutsch-russische wirtschaftsnachrichten '' , `` german-russian economy news '' , which is * very * russophile - so keep that in mind , especially when it comes to news about ukraine . 
  do n't bother , absolutely horrible source . 
    yet , the eu is still trying to implement the quotas ( which are against human rights ) . 
  how so ? 
  i think so too ... also , the public slowly but certainly stops tolerating hate speech on fb . 
  there have been multiple sackings of people because they posted horribly racist stuff in the last few weeks and the employers do n't want to be associated with such people , and the police made reporting such posts easier . 
  so ... i take it that you do n't actually know any germans or have ever visited germany ? 
  that 's what i 'm trying to say , actually . 
  now the eu just needs a few convenient internment camp islands to implement that oh-so-great australian handling of refugees ... 
  thankfully people like you are n't in control . 
  euobserver.com ... another shit source that gets way too much attention on / r/europe ... 
  the only thing i 'd loose sleep over when it comes to nuclear weapons is if a state with those weapons completely collapses - but even during the pretty chaotic disintegration of the soviet union the nuclear warheads were apparently guarded well enough , so there 's that ... 
  sure thing . 
  it 's not like you spent any time looking up things when you claimed all that nonsense in the starting post . 
  as long as they do n't make the decisions ... 
  the common digital market within the eu should have been established a decade ago ... but better late than never i guess . 
  turkey has a pretty big & powerful army , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  but i really doubt the russian regime is suicidal enough to attack an eu country/nato member - that would be a pretty certain ww3 trigger ... 
  at least not as long as erdogan rules over turkey ... 
  forbes `` sites '' ( all the pages like forbes.com/sites/xyz ) are often a pretty shoddy source , since it is little more than a blogging platform with a better brand : http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/173743/what-the-forbes-model-of-contributed-content-means-for-journalism/ not saying that this report is bullshit , but that 's something to keep in mind about forbes.com . 
  oh , sweeping generalisations . 
  europeans were also born into an area with great agricultural potential , abundant fresh water sources and a fairly temperate climate - all of which helps tremendously compared to eg sub-saharan countries . 
  and your notion that `` white europeans '' are the only ones that achieved success is simply racist . 
  so you never leave your country ? 
  of all the european countries , i think the german society is the most hardened against such a thing happening again . 
  never say never , but i 'd like to think at we europeans have at least learned the most basic things from all the awful events of the 20th century . 
   producing often more concentrations of hardline islamism in certain european cities than in most muslim cities around the world . 
  this is the bullshit claim that the un report has no correlation with . 
  nice whataboutism there ... 9/10 , would mislead again . 
  no , you 'd need a very charismatic demagogue & a horrible economic condition for that as well , at the very least . 
  your tinfoil hat slipped !, 
  quick , before any more loony conspiracy thoughts enter !, 
  i 'm well aware of that , it 's the same with austria - but a boycott of russian gas is n't really in the hands of the average consumer ... 
  those ones : http://www.ikea.com/at/de/catalog/products/10092216/ they 're great ... sturdy and big . 
  that true , have n't thought of the most obvious thing !, 
  well , absolut is a good alternative to stoli , 
  to be honest , i think i 'd have a hard time finding russian products here in austria - i have some ikea glasses that say `` made in russia '' , but other than that i do n't think i 've ever seen that label on something i bought in a store ... 
  well , any sort of reputable online news papers might be a good start . 
  bbc , nyt , wsj , guardian , telegraph in combination should give you a fairly balanced overview of english-language news . 
  there 's a huge world beyond reddit , you know ? 
  also , get past that weird notion that every deleted thread somehow is `` censorship '' , and that that constitutes a conspiracy in itself ... 
   i already seen it all over the / r/worldnews [ 1 ] threads on the issue . 
  well , there 's your problem ... if all you read is from obvious low quality sources ( and let 's be frank here , / r/worldnews is a complete shithole ) , it 's no wonder that you have a skewed worldview ... 
  it takes a very special kind of mindset to proactively see `` sjw '' conspiracies before even the first hint of one appears ... 
  even then it 's just a huge waste of money ... 
  as usual for the `` sky is falling '' - anti-immigration crowd , you 're painting with a * very * broad brush ... 
  what a great source / s in reality : http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-16/japan-needs-immigration-revolution-to-boost-dwindling-workforce/6086894, 
  there is no such thing as `` neutral media '' - they all have their biases . 
  that 's why it is so important to try to read multiple sources to get a comprehensive overview ... 
  such an unbiased source ... http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/us/politics/roy-h-beck-quietly-leads-a-grass-roots-army.html, 
   with a declining population , japan is on track to lose about half its workforce by 2060 , and with that , its status as an economic superpower . 
  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-16/japan-needs-immigration-revolution-to-boost-dwindling-workforce/6086894 and while i 'm well aware of the difference between immigration and taking in asylum seekers , japan will need to change their stance pretty rapidly ... 
  same publisher as bild , and hardly better than that ... 
  ^ ( hush now ! ), 
  * there are no kangaroos in austria . 
  the catholic church shares that line of thinking - and that has [ contributed to the hiv epidemic in sub-saharan countries ] ( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/16/africans-among-the-most-morally-opposed-to-contraception/ ) . 
  it 's a despicable & quixotic stance . 
  tasteless much ? 
   however , current events situations , traditions , and cultural factors which are unique to the country make it hard to understand the joke for someone who is not aware of the events being referred to . 
  this applies especially to the widespread local dialects and customs in germany . 
  in other cases the humour derives from mixing different styles of speech or contrasting them with each other . 
  for instance , the comedian helge schneider is renowned for his absurdist and anarchical humour , yet due to the deep roots of his humour in the german language and its several stylistic levels , much of his material is lost when translated into english . 
  [ wikipedia on german humor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german_humour ) that paragraph sums up pretty well why people who do n't understand german often think that germans have no sense of humor whatsoever . 
  comedians like stermann & grissemann , monika gruber or even cindy von marzahn are hilarious in my opinion , but their humor just does n't really translate into another language ... 
  just out of curiosity : where would you exile all those people to ?
