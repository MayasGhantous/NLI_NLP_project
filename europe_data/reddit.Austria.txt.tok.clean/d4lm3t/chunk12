  just saw it again on tv . 
  thousands are crossing your great fence with no resistance at all . 
  hopefully some powerful nation like moldawia wo n't invade you when they see this . 
   i can tell you the outcry wo n't be from hungary but bleeding heart germans and austrians . 
  if you follow the geneva convention i can see no reason for any outcry . 
   last time i checked greece is in the schengen zone too . 
  then hungary can return refugees there . 
  interesting , can you link to the nyt article please ? 
   yes you did . 
  you said 18,000 have claimed refuge . 
  i have since corrected myself with current data i just could n't find in english , so i posted an official document in german . 
  there were over 37.000 who seeked asylum in austria in 2015 up until july . 
   hungary could close its borders to serbia ? 
  please do so . 
  stop illegal immigration , get people to register and process their status . 
  or do you intend to close the borders to austria ? 
  you wo n't last very long . 
  too many hungarians who work in austria would lose their jobs as a consequence . 
  it would also be a violation of the schengen treaty . 
   but then you cry babies are going to be shouting nazis . 
  i 'm asking hungary to follow schengen and geneva conventions . 
  nobody will call them nazis for that . 
  in fact , prove one , just a single one quote from a politician from austria or germany who called any hungarian politician a nazi . 
  this would cause an outrage if made public . 
  i just made a google news search using \u201e hungary nazis `` . 
  all i could find is that some hungarian neonazis ( blood and honour ) [ got into trouble travelling through austria ] ( http://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/08/13/hungarian-neo-nazis-shut-out-of-austrian-art-academy-that-rejected-hitler.html ) . 
  other than that the only one making a nazi reference [ is a hungarian himself ] ( http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/09/08/438473559/in-todays-migrant-crisis-echoes-of-hungarys-troubled-past ) . 
  wtf are you accusing austria and germany of ? 
  if anything , building fences was the favourite border control measure of communist leaders in the east . 
   so how is it that the migrants make it to hungary in the first place if other european countries are doing ` their job ' ? 
  last time i checked hungary was a land locked nation . 
  last time i checked hungary are the only ones incapable of dealing with the situation conforming to the schengen treaty . 
  i can not blame serbia or macedonia , can i ? 
  and if hungary can prove that refugees were in greece first , they could send them back . 
  hungary even could send them back to serbia , hungarian laws allow that . 
  but hungary does n't register them and lets them move around freely causing major problems in hungary as well . 
  here 's an [ interview ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000021802938/ungarns-aussenminister-solidaritaet-bedeutet-dass-wir-unsere-grenzen-verteidigen ) with p\u00e9ter szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 ( in german , sorry , it 's too long for me to translate it - you might wan na use google translate ) . 
  he makes some good points too btw , eg . 
  asking for eu help for turkey and other countries in the are of syria so that conditions for refugees there get better . 
  see the grey spots in the north west , north of klagenfurt . 
  that 's what i call mountains . 
  eastern hungary are just hills with trees on top ( hence the colour , mountains are made of rock and grey on sat images ) . 
  i 've been there . 
  i know the landscape . 
  they go through hungary because hungary makes it easy for them . 
  holy crap !, 
  it 's on the right hand side of the page , december 2014 . 
  55,598 refugees , 22,745 asylum seekers in austria . 
  but if this is too old for you then check out this [ pdf ] ( http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/bmi_asylwesen/statistik/files/2015/asylstatistik_juli_2015.pdf ) published by the interior ministry of austria in july ( august data is not yet available ) . 
  you might not understand german so you have to trust me . 
  on page 3 you have the numbers for 2015 total asylum seekers ( new arrivals only ! ) . 
  the next column ( \u201e vorjahr `` ) refers to 2014 , the percentage is the over-year increase in applications . 
  these people are all in camps right now , with about 2.500 living in tents at the moment . 
  that are 500 less than orban says that are in hungary . 
  keep in mind austria is around 10 % smaller and has less inhabitants than hungary . 
  and stop calling hungary evil . 
  that 's not the tone in which we should talk about fellow eu members . 
  i have never said , syrians use the central or western mediterranean route into europe . 
  you did , so the joke 's on you . 
  i give a fuck about the origins of the people coming and if they are rightful refugees protected under international law or not . 
  that 's the job of the first schengen country to find that out . 
  that 's the job hungary is unable to do ** for months ** . 
  i just gave you examples of countries that face a similar situation like hungary but got it mostly under control . 
  you asked for it , i told you about it . 
  all i ask is that hungary does its job it agreed to do in order to get free access to the rest of europe . 
  others can do it , why ca n't they ? 
  so you are a typical whining eastern european who only likes the eu laws if it gives them lots of subsidies and privileges but chickens out of everything once they have to do their side of the contract . 
  oh , i 'm so looking forward to all the whining if austria really closes it 's borders . 
  then it 's 30 + km traffic jam on hungarian motorways . 
  we 'll see how you 'll like that . 
  i was wrong . 
  18.000 is way too low . 
  [ here 's the official unhcr numbers for last year . 
  ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e48e256.html ) it has only risen ever since . 
   they are n't allowed to lock people up for illegal entry . 
  starting sept. 15 ^ th they can with a new law that is against the geneva convention , but orban is all yolo about it . 
  if people start a riot [ last i looked ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_protests_in_hungary ) hungary used its police to calm the situation down . 
  do they only use police against their local population nowadays ? 
   the migrants refuse to go in the camps for registration . 
  cute . 
  what happens if you refuse orders by the government ? 
   they can follow dublin or be humane not both . 
  if only they started one of both things . 
  right now they do everything they can to get refugees over the schengen border as quickly as possible while making their journey as difficult as possible . 
  i have yet to see images of other eu countries that allow hundreds of people to walk on motorways . 
  that 's just plain acting dumb by the hungarian authorities . 
   oh well i can keep writing and writing but it wo n't make a difference . 
  that 's probably true for 99,9 % written on reddit . 
  as if syrians were the only refugees . 
  have you been living under a rock over the past few years ? 
  thousands of refugees died trying to cross the mediterranean into italy and many of them try to enter spain via its north african enclaves . 
  you might consider taking a little geography lesson by looking at [ this eu graphic ] ( http://frontex.europa.eu/trends-and-routes/migratory-routes-map/ ) next time first before making any arrogant statements . 
  oh would they ? 
  i 've yet to hear any complaints against croatia , slowenia , italy or spain who manage to have the situation under control and not let thousands of people run around their country just like they please . 
   funny then i wonder who the people are that are against migrants flooding into europe the way they are . 
  not in power , that 's for sure . 
  hungary today has de facto ceased to do anything about them and they 're the most open country right now . 
  all under the eyes of orban the fucking left-extreme socialist . 
   little do you know we actually care about our culture and values . 
  in this context , who do you mean with `` we '' ?
