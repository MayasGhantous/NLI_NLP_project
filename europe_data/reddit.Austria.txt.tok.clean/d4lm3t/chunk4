  my employer used to ban academic titles from email signatures until some people complained that there are no educated staff in the company . 
  so we ended up with business cards in english with titles no one ever heard of . 
  in my case , i 'm a dipl.-ing . 
  ( engineering degree ) and everytime i show my id ( driver 's licence , passport , ... ) anywhere i just cover up this part written next to my family 's name in order not to confuse citizens of civilised countries . 
  it only applies to wives . 
  no way that a women can have a more prestigious title than a man in a marriage . 
  but these times are hopefully gone nowadays . 
  then they 'll have to change their relationship status on facebook to \u201e it 's complicated `` . 
  in austria the right wing parties ( fp\u00d6 , j\u00f6rg haider 's former party and it 's spin-offs ) in carinthia refuse to put up bilingual town signs for decades . 
  when they were first put up according to our own constitution , they were torn down by some nationalist dumbasses . 
  some signs have been put up after endless debates and compromises . 
  you can find some information on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carinthian_slovenes ) . 
  i forgot to mention in my previous post that usually wives used to get their husbands ' titles too . 
  so a doctor 's wife used to be adressed with \u201e frau doktor `` , even if she was a waitress . 
  btw , i 'm talking about the academic title and not the medical profession here , so the doctor in question could just as well be a philosopher . 
  the wife of the mayor was adressed \u201e frau b\u00fcrgermeister `` , the wife of a privy counsellor was \u201e frau hofrat `` and so on . 
  definetly not . 
  and it 's safe to skip your religion too . 
  academic , professional and sometimes even hereditary titles are quite important in austria . 
  it helps getting you a doctor appointment earlier if you have an engineering degree for example , i know that from first hand experience . 
  i never use my title , but it 's part of the name and therefore visible to the doctors ' assistants when entering the social security number . 
  i hate this system . 
  * smallest german speaking country and the only one where german is used exclusively . 
  * the hymn shares its melody with `` god save the queen '' . 
  * tax haven . 
  hans-adam ii has some problems when austria or germany critisise liechtenstein for that . 
  * has no motorway of its own but is directly connected to the swiss motorway network by exits ending in liechtenstein . 
  * the railway is operated by the austrian federal railroads . 
  these guys were probably from asfinag , the state company that runs the motorways . 
  they just love to check tourist cars stopped at gas stations . 
  protip : better not stop next time . 
  your windshield is now covered with toll stickers . 
  do you live in gorizia ? 
  that 's a very beautiful city . 
   german is still understood and widely spoken in carinthia and styria that 's a good one . 
  styrian and carinthian german is quite different from standard german . 
   tina maze i think she should not be mentioned without a [ picture ] ( http://www.womensmovement.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tina-maze-heisser-ski-hase-e13541583298981.jpg ) . 
  please translate , thanks . 
  these jokes are quite funny . 
  especially coming from croatia where you can have one hand in the sea and the other one touching bosnian ground . 
  * trolling with toll stickers just like austria . 
   * currently in economic troubles * often underestimated by people who seem to have forgotten that yugoslavia ceased to exist . 
  * bullet holes from ricochets that happened during the independence war are still visible in austria near the border . 
  some soldiers deserted over the austrian border . 
  that includes a fighter jet landing in klagenfurt without any austrian planes even taking off to intercept it . 
  oh , the glorious austrian army !, 
  * the minority rights of slovenes in carinthia are on the austrian political agenda for decades and have improved lately . 
  * has a small stretch of coast and had disputes with croatia over seafaring rights that have been settled as croatia entered the eu . 
  * their national symbol is the `` herzogstuhl '' which is in a museum in klagenfurt , austria . 
  * maribor is known for their fish restaurants , although it is far away from the sea . 
  * the mountain region is very beautiful . 
  soca valley , bled and triglav national park are very recommended . 
  * prekmurje was independent for a couple of days . 
  i once slept in the hotel where indepence was declared by coincidence . 
  * zlatko avsenik and his oberkrainer style of music heavily influenced austrian modern folk music . 
  they sung in austrian dialect probably because the austrian market was more important than the slovenian one . 
  * laibach ( band ), 
  although i do n't speak spanish , i can make sense of most of the words , but i do n't get arrecife artificial . 
  a quickly googled online dictionary does n't know arrecife either . 
  please help . 
  btw , `` body '' by itself refers to a leotard . 
  this is anglicism one of my pet peeves . 
  some more come to my mind : * playback - lip-syncing * trucker - truck driver * chips - crisps * fitness studio - gym * pullunder - vest * rowdy - thug * training - workout * wellness - i do n't know the correct english term for it but it 's definetly not english as native speakers from the us and uk are always asking wtf this is supposed to mean . 
  same in italian . 
  then pack your stuff together and go to the [ musee herg\u00e9 ] ( http://www.museeherge.com/ ) in nouvain-la-neuve . 
  it 's super-awesome !, 
  that 's a shame but probably the illumination cost an arm and a leg . 
  * tintin and other belgian comics . 
  i know a lot about belgium because herg\u00e9s work awoke my interest in the country . 
  * weird , but good tasting beer . 
  * inventors of \u201e french `` fries . 
  * mitraillette * motorways are illuminated at night but also generally in quite a bad shape . 
  * most public infrastructure in brussels needs more and better maintenance . 
  i 've never seen so many escalators and lifts out of order than in the brussel metro . 
  * the country holds the world record in not having a government . 
  * i like to make road trips to the uk so i 've mostly only driven through the country but whenever i make a stop in the well known cities i find it really beautiful there . 
  * if you post pictures of the atomium on the internet the architects will sue you because the architects have a copyright on the building . 
  * we have some history in common . 
  * [ three guys , one hammer . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/three_guys_one_hammer ) * lemberg/lviv is closer to vienna than bregenz . 
  it was the easternmost city of the habsburg empire . 
  * chernobyl * air show desaster * orange revolution * imprisoned former female prime minister with a really nice hairstyle * euro 2012, 
  * weapons , weapons everywhere . 
  * nice city centre on top of mount titano and it takes a scenic cablecar ride to get there . 
  * about the size and population of my home town . 
   * rimini is nearby . 
  * there is no real border , only a welcome sign above the road . 
  * there is a monument/plate that was given to them by the us for being the oldest democracy . 
  maybe there 's some connection to the lincoln citizenship ? 
  * medieval guards in front of the palace makes you think you 're in some kind of fantasy movie . 
  * really , really clean and polished . 
  * it is a bit weird , so when i was there i made a plan to visit all small european states just for fun . 
  andorra and luxembourg are still missing . 
   smallest state in europe . 
  no way . 
  vatican and monaco are definetly smaller . 
  the racing track is in [ italy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/san_marino_grand_prix ) . 
  good guy cecinestpasunepony , i wish more native speakers gave feedback in your style . 
  virtually every carpenter , plumber , electrician , ... asks \u201e do you want an invoice or save 20 % `` . 
  many small restaurants and bars do n't give you a proper invoice , just some handwritten note without a copy to file with the tax authorities .
