  yes , with a funny name if your native language is german . 
   we love the spaniards , but we despise them !, 
  as an austrian i can very much relate to this sentiment . 
  we have similar feelings towards our german friends up north . 
  oh , so that 's why i got offered weed in daylight on a busy square in lisbon . 
  til !, 
  and a [ great version ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:lisboa-lisbon-_panorama.jpg ) of the golden gate bridge . 
  actually lisbon was one of the hottest cities i 've ever visited . 
  do not go there for sightseeing in july !, 
  * sardinhas grilladas * super bock * lisbon is one of the nicest capitals i 've seen so far . 
  loved it !, 
  * vinho do porto !!!, 
  * henry the navigator , daring explorers of the world * used to be fascist , got rid of the dictator using carnation flowers * lisbon was hit by a huge tsunami some centuries ago . 
  * very far away so i can not visit the country as frequently as i 'd like to . 
  * more than a thousand are a crazy metal band . 
  they played in my home town in austria and drove here non-stop by themselves ( ~ 3.000 km ) !, 
  ** fuck ** these incestous war losers . 
  good riddance !, 
  if they were still in charge , we 'd have a king that got caught smuggling and stole money from an ngo in order to fund his political career . 
  who needs crooks like these ? 
  only other crooks , that 's who . 
   the carinthian lakes just are n't the same mostly because you ca n't enjoy them because it 's raining most of the time . 
  awful child memories of vacations there , awesome memories of italy and yugoslavia where summers were actually summers . 
  i could n't agree with you more . 
  i can - however - understand guys who used there dr. in order to get a wife wanting to be mrs. dr. 
  but i do n't think this works any longer . 
  in reality it is not that bad . 
  depends . 
  make a recording of it and post it and then i 'll judge you . 
  this joke basically works best after a couple of drinks and in person . 
  thank you . 
  that 's probably the nicest comment i 've ever got on the internet , my friend !, 
  yes , but not limited to titles . 
  we address people formally with herr/frau < surname  . 
  if there is a title herr doktor or herr doktor < surname  is usually the polite way . 
  thank you for fixing that . 
  i expressed more opinion than knowledge . 
  it is local dialect . 
  it means `` tail of a squirrel '' , eichk\u00e4tzchenschweif in standard german . 
  we use the word as a pronouncing challenge to non-austrians . 
  we do n't `` sie '' as frequently as the germans and academic titles are still very important . 
  as someone with an engineering degree i get appointments quicker with doctors . 
  it is a shame , i really hate it , but you can not hide your degree on your social security id . 
  loved it in hamburg , but it 's slightly different from our radler . 
  maybe a different soft drink ? 
  i would say radler is an austrian thing , but i would like to hear the opinion of a german redditor . 
  my late grandmother was quite angry because of the loss of south tyrol . 
  she used to say that after wwi `` they '' ( the winners ) took away the best apples ( south tyrol is famous for their apples ) and gave us a land full of gypsies ( burgenland ) . 
  i know this sounds racist , but it is authentic . 
  i do n't care about the `` loss '' at all and so do most people apart from some right-wing activists and ultra-conservatives . 
  the station is named after the square above it ( s\u00fcdtiroler platz ) . 
  the square was probably named so before wwi . 
  i get what you mean now . 
  everything is a little bit more formal here than in germany . 
  are k&d still big in the uk ? 
  i remember going to london in 2000 and see posters about them ( gig ? 
  new album ? 
  ca n't remember ) all over the place while they were almost unknown in the general public here . 
  perfect grammar ? 
  not in colloquial language . 
  no way , oida !, 
  great post highlighting the difficulties you had back then . 
  funny , because gorenje is a slowenian company . 
  i remember very talented hungarians in the amiga home computer demoscene in the early nineties . 
  i was in sopron on a demoparty and people coded on b/w tvs and could not see what they 're doing in colour until they found somebody with a colour monitor so they did everything from memory without visual feedback . 
  wow !, 
   people from eastern europe would come to austria to buy things before the iron curtain fell . 
  i can not confirm this . 
  more the other way around : many austrians from my area went to hungary before and mostly after the fall of the iron curtain to stock up on cheap groceries . 
  i do n't know whether hungarians could easily travel to austria before [ mr. habsburg had a picnic with them ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pan-european_picnic ) . 
  i got that reference . 
  the best soft drink ever . 
  you should start exporting this stuff and put coca cola to shame . 
  i 've been there a couple of times and own two volvos , so ... * driest humor known to me * there are places that are not beautiful , but they 're well hidden * excellent english skills * strong alcohol and wine are very expensive , beer is n't * the second best music scene outside of the uk * really , really cold up north in the winter * the best welcome signs on any airport are those in arlanda . 
  they say `` welcome to my hometown '' featuring a surprising lot of famous people from stockholm . 
  in my school i had the choice between italian and french . 
  i chose french and it felt that it was dumbed down in comparison to english . 
  i do not speak much french nowadays but i consider myself fluent in english . 
  i encounter english on a daily basis but i never need french . 
  british english is taught in austria as well . 
  my english teacher who was austrian had spent a couple of years in london before teaching in school and we had some native speakers from the uk as well . 
  we also listened to bbc programmes at school and read uk magazines . 
  most tv stations that were available back then were from the uk too ( mtv uk was my favourite back in the 90s ) and many pupils spent a week in england during their education . 
  we were also taught much about the uk daily life , e.g. 
  the conflict in northern ireland , the british school system , british culture and sights , ... there was a semester dedicated to us english once , but i did n't fully understand the differences back then . 
  there used to be a public radio station in austria called blue danube radio that used english almost exclusively and had mostly british djs , some were american . 
  today that station is called fm4 and is still broadcast in english half of the day . 
  til carnival happens every week in romania . 
  then i must be living in a place forgotten by google . 
  if everyone could see how beautiful this place is , the rest of europe would lose a lot of tourism . 
  like they stopped updating google maps in austria back in 2008 or something ? 
  the map in my area is missing roads constructed five years ago , lists businesses that closed down ages ago and the sat images must be at least a decade old . 
  google maps ** really ** sucks in austria . 
  i know i can edit the maps myself but i 'd rather do that on osm , at least they do n't charge anyone for using their maps . 
  [ illegaly sniffing wifi data ] ( http://www.engadget.com/2013/04/22/google-street-view-fine-germany/ ) while driving around did n't exactly help either . 
  correct , however back in my youth ( 90s ) a prolo was someone different . 
  techno/dancemusic was n't that big and most prolos were metalheads driving opel kadetts with big metal band logos on the rear window . 
  well , no ... yugo is a derogatory term for yugoslavian . 
  however , in my area there are two kinds of annoying people . 
  lower class who do n't give a shit about their looks wearing track suits outside of gyms where they belong , similar to the chavs in uk .
