in the russian media he still seems pretty convinced that the former soviet nations need to be reunited . 
  so the question is , will those sanctions make him come to his senses or will it make things more drastic in the long run ? 
  precisely what i thought when i first read about this statement . 
  nokia essentially had their heads too far up their asses to realise that all their symbian and maemo efforts to create a competitive smartphone lineup were getting them nowhere so they kept waiting for a miracle to happen ( i guess adopting android was never really an option for them anyways ) until they had lost all their relevance . 
  source : * i bought the nokia n97 mini with high expectations back in 2009 when everyone was marvelling at the iphone for its sleek ui . 
  the ads for the n97 mini even suggested similar ui features like rotation animations and fluent navigation but in essence it had none of that and of course with almost no apps on the ovi store to enrich the experience it was essentially a brick with a dedicated keyboard that you could make phonecalls with ( at least to me ) . 
  * * needless to say i never bought a nokia device ever again in my life . 
  finally something we excel at . 
   that austrian guy * pshh * ca n't we just let the whole world be mad at germany instead of worrying about technicalities ? 
  well by `` in charge of '' i mean he publicly speaks on both national and international affairs . 
  there 's no prime minister or chancellor of the united states . 
  of course it 's not like he can dictate everything that 's going on . 
  i totally get that `` low casualty '' argument . 
  but whoever is responsible for securing the integrity of ukraine ( i guess that would be the un like you said ) seems to be ignoring who they 're up against . 
  since it is obvious to everyone outside of russia that putin is in fact involved then it should also be obvious that someone like putin does n't stop until he gets what he wants . 
  you ca n't do `` peaceful '' with putin . 
  which i never said anyways . 
  but seeing it from a us american 's perspective i totally get it . 
  to them it probably would n't even matter if bill clinton had gone to britain in order to learn how to eradicate the entire united states ' national debt . 
  their priorities are just different in that sense . 
  i 'm sorry but there 's something about you saying `` das reich '' and your flair that will probably never seize to feel weird . 
  plural is n't a gender though . 
  it 's hard to say what gender the netherlands actually are in german . 
  singular `` das niederland '' would be neutrum i guess ? 
  i understand where you 're coming from . 
  i get that you want your presidents to be born on us american soil and everything but would it really have made clinton a worse candidate even though his beliefs were the same ? 
  i mean sure you could say had he been abroad for 40 years he would n't even know his own people well enough to represent them but i guess that 's not that much of a priority to estonians since their president is born in sweden anyways . 
  i can only speak from a central european standpoint rather than a baltic one but i think in general this does n't hold true for any country in western civilization . 
  sure we might think that us americans have a wasteful way of living or things like that but if for example a medical student from austria did his medschool internship in the us it would rather help him get a job back in austria than hinder him . 
  and i think the same goes for president ilves . 
  on a sidenote : i do n't know too much about the politics of estonia but from what wikipedia tells me they also have a prime minister who i guess is responsible for everything that the president is n't . 
  so while you us americans have always had a president who is basically in charge of everything it works quite differently in many other countries . 
  i guess what i 'm trying to say is that because of this division of power among multiple persons maybe the president of estonia is more relevant to you than he is to estonians . 
  for example in germany the president has , under normal circumstances , almost no function at all because both national and international affairs are taken care of by the chancellor . 
  ca n't say i did n't expect something like that . 
  obama is like the ultimate chill dude travelling the earth in the air force 1 with the world 's greatest military at his disposal . 
  by the way : who is this mr. paet to you estonians ? 
  can someone here read lips ? 
  says the guy named / u/pladmir _ vutin . 
  i do n't know what to believe anymore . 
   if only hitler had left some clues about what he thought of russians , communists and the land they lived on . 
  perhaps in some kind of book maybe . 
  silly you . 
  why would he do such a thing ? 
  link does n't work for me , what 's supposed to be there ? 
  to whoever made the graphic :  * than, 
  has he ever tried fixing the corruption ? 
  it seems to me he has always been part of it . 
  i guess it is possible that his point of view has changed somehow in recent years , but he has always been corrupt * ( how else do you get to be president 3 times when constitution only allows 2 ) * and i do n't see why he would have ever had a problem with russian corruption . 
  i still do n't have this `` of course , it 's so obvious '' realization from what you say . 
  to me he is just this semi-dictator who thought he could annex the ukraine because people there want to be russian again and now he has to watch as his currency and his economy go down the drain and he ca n't do much about it unless he pulls back and sticks his nose up obama 's and merkel 's butts . 
  i do n't see at all how he could want his government to fail so that everyone will remember him for causing the greatest recession of the post-soviet era . 
   did n't i already explain it in my post ? 
  i do n't see a post , just a comment . 
  and you did not explain why putin would want this in your other comment . 
  so you 're saying since his first presidency in 2000 putin is seeking to run the russian economy to the ground , even though he has only started acting up on an international level in recent years ? 
  i do n't buy it . 
  regardless of whether he opposes communism like he claimed in 1999 , most of the things he did was to make things better for russia , even if he has some very dictatorial ways of doing so . 
  i think one of the most important things he did economically was that he made russia a key oil and gas supplier to europe . 
  this helped the russian economy skyrocket during his second presidential term . 
  would you say that all those things he did up until about one year ago was just a buildup so that the economy will fall even harder ? 
   he wo n't really need to worry about the consequences of his actions . 
  maybe he does n't need to worry , but you make it sound like he is intentionally running down the russian economy . 
  ** why would he do that ? 
  ** from what i understand the average russian does n't really have the same viewpoint as `` we '' do . 
  the russians want their nation to be glorious and respected , maybe even feared , by the rest of the world . 
  by that logic i think putin is very much acting in the interest of his people , regardless of whether he needs an elaborate apparatus of state-censorship to black out the negativities about his leadership . 
  art works in [ mysterious ways ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c1oazg6.jpg ) my friend . 
  plot twist : it 's an oil painting . 
  yes i actually wrote it the way you would say it as an austrian while still staying close to written german . 
  of course there are many different dialects in austria , as there are in germany or switzerland but generally reading this out loud would either make you sound austrian or maybe bavarian , which is pretty similar . 
  sorry i thought this was / r/austria , but yea , i do n't think that post is bound for greatness .

  are you wishing erdogan good luck with that or who are you talking to now ? 
  no one is talking about vpn servers inside turkey . 
  `` vpn '' in this case is just another word for being able to surf the internet with a non-turkish ip-address to circumvent erdogan 's blockades . 
  and he already seems to be [ working on closing that hole ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5b5zca/turkey_blocks_several_vpn_services/ ) .

  * sigh * if only ... 
  still the main point of nato was to oppose the former ussr , so russia basically . 
  if a nato member now does a 180 and strengthens ties with russia it ca n't possibly in the best interest of the rest , no matter how weak russia may be compared to its heyday . 
  well / u/verylateish suggested erdogan should just block the entire internet . 
  there was no comparison to iran there . 
  and i did n't really compare them i just said that neither iran nor dprk apply as rolemodels here , both of which have been mentioned as such in this thread . 
  has it worked with russia though ? 
  granted turkey might have less cash reserves , but still , erdogan will be able to spin it as an aggressive move on behalf of the west and keep his momentum , if not gain some as well . 
  the problem is nato . 
  i agree about the eu not engaging in any more negotiations with turkey , but erdogan and putin becoming best buddies is just as problematic as a eu membership for turkey would be . 
  like others have said in here , he does n't want to be dprk or iran , he wants to be like russia . 
  as soon as he has a corrupt enough system in place to just win every election as he pleases he probably wo n't even need to block anything anymore , but until then he needs to use his state-of-emergency powers as best he can to make things go his way . 
  the ultimate goal as far as i know is to change the constitution to give the president more power . 
  so it 'll be kind of like caesar making himself dictator for life when originally there was only supposed to be a dictator during wartimes and such . 
  so demonstrations against immigrants/terrorists win by a count of 3 to 2 ? 
  i 'm not saying those unions are exactly the same or even close to that . 
  but the members of these unions draw similar advantages from them in terms of economical stability . 
  the eu might be just as much of a mess as you say the us is . 
  the quality of life for people in the eu is much more dependent on what your country ( = state in the us ) can do for you . 
  the eu does n't really care about social security or healthcare nor does it take any payments from its members for it .
