  you are right , you can have trade connections while still being your own entity in this world . 
  switzerland is doing just fine , surrounded by nothing but eu-members . 
  but let 's not forget that we 're talking about switzerland here . 
  they have more money than they know what to do with . 
  we will see if the uk can pull a similar thing off . 
  but i think it 's very much possible that scotland and even northern ireland shall secede from the uk which i think will be the nail in the coffin of the uk being a major economical force in this world ever again . 
  just like the us-americans giving senators in dc shit us europeans often complain about being bossed around by someone other than our own respective governments but i think especially when you share a common currency you ca n't put in words how much this makes everyone within this union prosper . 
  what you do n't seem to understand is that without the eu there is no `` europe '' as such . 
  just like there is no `` america '' as in the continent consisting of north - and south-america operating in a common interest . 
  there is a united states of america maintaining prosperity for all of its member-states , a level of which could not be attained by any of the individual states . 
  if you take the eu out of europe you will eventually fall back to a number of individual states sharing nothing but a geographical continent and a heap of bureaucracy overshadowing their trade connections . 
  while i 'm just wondering how big russia 's largest tv is . 
  i think the main thing that the eu lacks in that regard is that as a union it is n't comparable to how the us is seen as one country where no one really cares about the poltical views of - for example - the governor of california or a constellation of political views within that union , they have one president who essentially represents the entire union whereas most countries in the eu do n't even want to go towards such a system in the first place . 
  so we will never have this one entity ( i.e. 
  a white house , senate etc. ), 
  that can speak for those millions upon millions of eu citizens on an international stage . 
  the ec does make legislation and all that but i still do n't think brussels is in any way comparable to d.c. also the eu is n't part of the g8 in place of its subordinate countries france germany and italy . 
  so even leaving brexit and its implications aside completely there is n't the same unity among eu countries , neither politically nor on a more basic level looking at whether a citizen from one country would tend to associate themselves with a citizen from a different country within the union . 
  we all `` pledge allegiance '' so to speak to our own respective flags , not to this 12-yellow-star-spangled blue banner or whatever we would call it then . 
  i think if this were to change , which in the near future it most probably wo n't , then we would probably have a pretty good shot at taking the place of the united states as `` leaders of the free world '' but like i said , it 's not just about politics . 
  we have a language barrier which is hard to overcome and you ca n't really convince anybody to commit themselves fully to such a great union when you are n't completely convinced that those other people are `` just like you '' . 
  we as europeans do n't predominantly despise each other or anything , but we would n't exactly go to war for each other either . 
  if some terroristic act like 9/11 was committed in madrid for example , there would n't be the same sense of unity in the entire eu like there was in the us . 
  other european countries would n't feel like this was a threat to `` their way of life '' or something like that , they would see it as an attack on spain , their society and whatever values it represents . 
  so i guess the ** tl ; dr ** of it all is that the eu is more of a trade union than a union of actual people and this , in my eyes , is the main reason we will not be seen as one collective force for western values on a global stage anytime soon . 
  also true . 
  people voting for trump , brexit or hofer have real issues and concerns that need to be addressed , the reality though is that they might not be voting for the right thing after all ( in their defence though , like i said , if there 's no one else at least addressing your issues , what ` cha gon na do ? ) . 
  with trump it certainly looks like he wo n't live up to his promises , and an austrian president has next to zero influence on national politics so whatever norber hofer may have promised his voters ultimately could n't have been anything but a fabrication to gain more support either . 
  compromise ai n't the name of erdogan 's game . 
   intellectual discourse on a national level is not something that will ever work in the near future , some call it `` post-truth '' society , but whatever you want to call it , the average person is n't getting any smarter , they actually seem to be getting dumber , and there 's enough evidence in 2016 alone to prove that . 
  i 'm not saying that only dumb people would vote for trump or brexit , i 'm saying that the effectiveness of populism is on the rise again and whatever it is that populists are fighting for , they always count on mobilizing voters through their emotions instead of their rationale and when it comes to politics , that 's just plain dumb behavior when you go to the ballots . 
  sebastian kurz is definitely not the worst incarnation of this phenomenon and what / u/macrosolid says definitely rings true with what i 'm personally seeing in the aftermath of our presidential election , any party that does n't make an effort to appeal to protest-voters who just turn to the fp\u00d6 because they do n't feel represented by any other party will eventually become irrelevant to a point where they ca n't possibly hope to be part of the next administration . 
  it 's been a major topic in the presidential campaign of norbert hofer so even though he lost the election he still said a lot of things that are popular opinions in the country and he essentially made it seem like his party is the only one supporting those views . 
  the ruling parties and their ministers need to pick up the pieces of their migrant crisis politics that got them so much hate and sort of adapt their actions to be more in line with what the population ( 46 % of them based on presidential election results ) seems to want otherwise they will get crushed come the next election in autumn 2018 . 
  so you 're just saying things now that have already been said ? 
  there 's no relevance to my last comment as far as i 'm concerned . 
  which is exactly my point saying that looking at gdp growth with constant prices does not draw the entire picture either because most things consumers buy do n't get more expensive 1:1 with inflation all the time . 
  what i did not previously know but someone else told me in this thread is that your population suffered a lot from higher prices when the euro was introduced . 
  we had this problem in austria as well ( media called it the `` teuro '' , teuer = expensive ) but probably not at the same scale , still i think that the gdp growth i originally referenced without constant values has a lot of meaning to it , even if it might not factor in all the variables . 
  economy is about finances . 
  those statements feel contradicting . 
  again , do you think it would have been the same with the lira ? 
  i asked you before but you ignored my question . 
  interesting stuff . 
  i do n't follow italian politics at all . 
  it seems like there 's some major stuff going on and it hardly gets any coverage here in your neighboring country of austria . 
  i said i looked at them after you told me to . 
  yes it makes the curve look differently , yes it may draw a more accurate picture , but i gave you some arguments about why i think it 's not the whole truth either . 
  basically we 're still discussing this because i said the italian economy `` skyrocketed '' when your way of looking at it makes it look less drastic , but still my main point was that the italian economy profited from the euro just as everyone else in the union did . 
  this is also fact . 
  10 % over 6 years is still a sizable increase , of course no one 's talking about the global economic crisis that came afterwards . 
  no one cares that we do it . 
  sure austria is smaller but still kind of a gateway to lots of other countries , we 've had the toll for almost 20 years now and since there 's a track record ( no pun intended ) you can see it should hold more positives than negatives if you do it right . 
  we never tried to favour our own citizens by only having foreigners pay . 
  i 'd be surprised if that was what germany would ultimately do . 
  also if they end up figuring out a way to do it like that , i 'd want my government to do the same . 
  that 's pretty much all it comes down to . 
  edit : in addition , if germany ends up only charging foreigners for using their roads , i want austria to be allowed to only charge foreigners ( most of which are numerus clausus refugees from germany ) for occupying free spots at our universities . 
  you may say traffic and education are two topics of unequal importance , but the fact is that austria 's education system is very easy on the wallet of essentially every citizen of the european union who chooses to come here and why should germany be allowed to have foreigners subsidise their roads when we 're still supposed to finance their education on our own . 
  i did not originally say `` doubled '' i said `` skyrocketed '' and i did look at constant . 
  will you only consider answering my questions after i told you that or what is the problem right now that makes you feel the need to be condescending ? 
  so you 're basically blaming the european union for poverty that resulted from italy being rotten with corruption in the 90s ? 
  so you 're trying to tell me that the same thing would have happened if you stuck with the lira ? 
  also nominal inflation is not the same as what you can actually buy for the money . 
  of course you have less influence on the inflation if it 's not your own currency but a shared one , still it 's the same for every euro-country and it served its purpose , economy thrived , so what 's your point ? 
  use what now ? 
  i used a [ chart with linear scaling ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=italy+gdp ) if you want to know the specifics . 
  are you seriously challenging * that * claim , seeing that your gdp doubled ( a.k.a. 
  100 % increase ) within 7 , read them ** seven ** , years , by reminding me of inflation or something ? 
   inflection i stopped reading , terribly sorry but i will not validate this with a reply , whatever you said after that, 
  oh so you have some of those trolls too ? 
  thats actually pretty funny considering one unit of your pre-euro currency was worth about as much as the daily wage of an indian child labourer . 
  just kidding . 
  but seriously what are your right wing populists telling the people about italy being better off without the euro ( pean union ) ? 
  your gdp per capita is just below the eu average , a bit above that of spain . 
  within the union your public debt is only bested by greece . 
  unemployment is easily in the bottom 10 . 
  also your gdp has been pretty stagnant through the 90s and then it skyrocketed when you joined the eu ( as it did for many others , common trade and currency yay ) , what do the nationalists think is going to happen if they take italy back to the 90s ?

  the point that anything would be rigged was never successfully made . 
  lots of irregularities happened but there was never any evidence that this was deliberate action against a specific candidate and it could also be concluded that the amount of votes that were lost or otherwise compromised within that admittedly odious negligence could not have given the other candidate the win , even if all of those would have been for hofer , which they most certainly were n't . 
  now that the result of the previous vote has been confirmed i can truly say it will have served a good purpose that these issues have been presented , even though i was a vocal opponent of the lawsuit brought in by hofer 's party at the time , not because of partisanship but because simply no one likes a sore loser . 
  and even though it was proven that the result would not have changed , the judges still deemed it necessary to repeat the vote , which cost us a lot of money but in the end did not cost us nearly as much as brexit and trump will cost their respective countries . 
  i too will upvote a citizen of the self-proclaimed `` greatest country in the world '' ( wait , why does it need to be made `` great again '' then ? ), 
  who is jealous of me any day . 
  i get what you are trying to say but i do n't think it 's that easy . 
  erdogan can use any outside influence to his benefit , like when germans said his party was not allowed to hold rallies in germany he called them nazis and it seems to have worked out for him so far . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  has the state of emergency since the `` coup-attempt '' even been lifted yet ? 
  i am guessing his immunity is harder to challenge than that of members of a small pro-kurdish party and he definitely seems to be in the spotlight so people would notice even if erdogan-controlled media were to cover it up . 
  op censored the quote by only citing half of it basically . 
  german is my native language and even if op paraphrased , bill gates did not say '' ** you must ** make it harder '' he said germany or europe must make it harder as a logical consequence of those circumstances he described earlier in his sentence , which i think is an essential part of what he said . 
  he did not say that . 
  he said because europe lets everyone in more people come and then your only option is to make it harder for them to not let it get out of hand basically . 
  op fukd up, 
  that is ** not ** what he said . 
  he said that because europeans are welcoming refugees with open arms people in africa hear about this and come in greater numbers , which in turn leaves europe only that one option of making it harder for people to come here . 
  buy some external hard-drives and put turkish wikipedia on there . 
  when you 've arrived , edit out all the bad stuff about turkey that dear leader erdogan does n't like , put up a website and call it turkipedia .
