  and they are already getting fucked by and regretting it . 
   they are n't . 
  they are n't what ? 
  proof of what i said has already been provided . 
  in the meantime you are just making baseless claims . 
  where is your proof for any of this ? 
  go on , cite it . 
   that 's okay , indepedence and/or a return to the eec is perfectly fine with me . 
  but if people want ` power ' that badly they should at least do it by glueing together compatible countries , not conflicting ones . 
  all countries are compatible . 
  they are populated by humans and humans are all the same . 
  the only difference is their education . 
  which can change . 
   but you are sharing a much greater amount of power with people of vastly different cultures who cares ? 
  sticking your head in the sand and trying to forget about the fact that we are all humans living on the same planet and that everything we do affects everyone is simply not a valid long term strategy . 
   certain policies would also no longer be possible . 
  like what ? 
   the smaller countries such as the netherlands , would experience a huge difference politics since their ethical/cultural/political standpoints would be drowned out by the larger populations in other countries . 
  citation needed . 
  especially for the dutch , whose standpoints are effectively in line with the surrounding countries , especially germany . 
  there is only one thing that 's certain : when it comes to the overall government , logic , reason and science will play a stronger rule , irrational ideologies will fall behind . 
  when it comes to democratic politics , people will be forced to engage in more debate . 
   you do n't think that would warrant a vote ? 
  it warrants a vote on a european scale , yes . 
  everyone in europe should vote on this topic . 
  what does china have to do with the conversation ? 
  china should n't have any referendum about tibet to begin with , there is no real debate here . 
  do you seriously buy into the `` free tibet '' bullshit ? 
  holy shit , historically and politically uninformed people commenting on issues they have no education about ... please , just stop . 
  and why does it disturb you ? 
   europe is not a single country and each country has the right to decide its future . 
  europe should be a single country and the people of europe as a whole should have the right to decide . 
   wow you observerd every person on earth who ever lived to confidently make such a general statement ? 
  ah , arguing semantics already . 
   not by the politicians of major parties or the msm in my country . 
  what country ? 
   race to the button ; inability to properly regulate ; international corporations becoming more powerful than entire nations . 
  that 's what happens when you are against a strong european government , yes . 
   i think the eu is the problem . 
  i do n't want it . 
  thank you very much . 
  you literally just complained about a race to the bottom and inability to properly regulate ... a consequence of nationalism , intergovernmentalism and a weak eu government . 
  so why would you think the eu is the problem ? 
   that 's nice newspeak for `` getting rid of national sovereignity '' . 
  it 's not nice newspeak . 
  yes , national sovereignty needs to end . 
  on a global scale . 
  why would you even disagree with that ? 
   these polls mean jackshit and why do they mean jackshit ? 
   people were never on board with the ` federal eu ' and where is your proof of that ? 
   especially not in the core eu who stands to be footing all the costs of such a project . 
  actually , core eu countries and a majority of others are exactly the ones who are on board with this . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/federal_europe#/media/file:eu_members_where_more_people_in_favor_of_the_european_federation.png  a federal germanic union or something i could get my head around , for a federal eu one must be completely senseless . 
  your opinion fortunately is n't the only one that people share and it 's not even a very popular one . 
   and then ask the people who should pay for all of this who will pay for these cost saving measures that will save everyone money ? 
   people do n't think about the sordid details of such lofty rhetorics yes . 
  you have just gloriously proven that . 
  if you disagree with democracy , then you should shut the hell up anyway and let the politicians do everything . 
  what the hell is your argument ? 
  heh , and only the usual suspects are against . 
  standing in the way of progress ( even if it 's just an attempt ) and wanting total failure of a system to return to a status quo that 's even worse ? 
  wow ... just wow . 
  for whom would it be worse and why ? 
  recent polls of eurobarometer as cited by guy verhofstadt in the european parliament : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtypteaqgxk `` this type of eu today : you ca n't defend it anymore . 
  europe needs to be reforged . 
  the european citizens are n't against europe , they are against *** this *** europe and the proof of that , mr. president , is the eurobarometer and i 'm asking myself why commission and parliament have not published this eurobarometer far earlier !, 
  you know what the results are ? 
  people : 82 % want more european action on the fight against terrorism . 
  77 % of the european citizens asked for more european action in the fight against unemployment . 
  75 % of the european citizens asked for more european action in the fight against tax fraud . 
  74 % of the european people ask for more european action on the issue of migration . 
  [ in response to ] 14 of the 15 questions put forward to the european people are asking for ** more ** european action . 
  not less european action . 
  what the citizens want is : a european border and coast guard . 
  a european asylum and migration policy to tackle the migration crisis . 
  to have european capacity and intelligence service to tackle terrorism . 
  to have a european government to defend the euro . 
  and to have a european army to defend our borders and to end conflicts in our neighbourhood . 
  * that is what the citizens are asking !, 
  here !, 
  * more of the same will not get us out of this crisis , dear colleagues !, 
  that is burying our heads in the sand !, 
  people want you to work on another europe !, 
  and by not doing that , you are sleepwalking towards a disaster !, 
  towards 27 other referendums in the near future !, 
  intergovernmentalism , a loose confederation of nation states based on unanimity ** can not work !, 
  ** that is the reality of the day that you do n't recognize until now !, 
  [ ... ] our dear union will change or it will die . 
  that is at stake . '', 
  well , not to be mean or anything , but you are wrong . 
  i 'm already getting tired of posting this , but let guy verhofstadt explain it to you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtypteaqgxk `` this type of eu today : you ca n't defend it anymore . 
  europe needs to be reforged .
