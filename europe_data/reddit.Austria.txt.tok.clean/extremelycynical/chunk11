   europe is not suddenly going to develop nothing ever suddenly develops . 
  it takes a long time and a lot of work . 
  like practically everything that 's worthwhile . 
  a truly united europe will take many generations to emerge . 
  slowly and through lots of investments , high costs and education . 
  i 'm already getting tired of posting this , but let guy verhofstadt explain it to you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtypteaqgxk `` this type of eu today : you ca n't defend it anymore . 
  europe needs to be reforged . 
  the european citizens are n't against europe , they are against *** this *** europe and the proof of that , mr. president , is the eurobarometer and i 'm asking myself why commission and parliament have not published this eurobarometer far earlier !, 
  you know what the results are ? 
  people : 82 % want more european action on the fight against terrorism . 
  77 % of the european citizens asked for more european action in the fight against unemployment . 
  75 % of the european citizens asked for more european action in the fight against tax fraud . 
  74 % of the european people ask for more european action on the issue of migration . 
  [ in response to ] 14 of the 15 questions put forward to the european people are asking for ** more ** european action . 
  not less european action .

   and that it has no negative side effects whatsoever . 
   all of your concerns are dismissed . 
  no , all concerns have been and continue to be thoroughly discussed . 
   then , when all the things happened which you were concerned about , they do n't tell you that they were wrong and that perhaps a certain level of protectionism is needed after all . 
  this is a non-argument . 
  what things ? 
   no , they say that the next step is to abolish the nation states . 
  this makes me absolutely livid . 
  yes . 
  nation states are a problem . 
  why does it make you livid that people recognize the need for collaboration ? 
  listen to your own guy , guy verhofstadt .

  nationalism is undermining european values . 
  brexit also is n't really democratic . 
  i would bet money on the citizens of europe overwhelmingly opposing brexit . 
  brexit effectively is a tiny elite attacking the interests of the european people . 
  national referendums and national governments should n't be able to independently make highly important decisions that affect all of the people in the union . 
   blind to these differences and therefore unable to imagine the european continent without the european union . 
  that would n't even be bad thing . 
  i do n't even know what you are complaining about . 
  also , it 's simply not true . 
  younger generations are pretty well educated about what the eu is and about the history of europe . 
  and it 's not `` blindness '' . 
  it 's called `` understanding '' . 
  the problem is that many older people are blinded by nostalgia and actually want to go back to a situation that was in every way worse than the one we have today . 
  and that a lot of the * actually * young people never experienced how much better things are today and believe those nostalgic people . 
  oh wait , that ageism does n't contribute to anything anyway .
