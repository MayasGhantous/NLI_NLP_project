  stop dividing people . 
  stop trying to speak for a generation of people . 
  why yes ? 
  yes to what ? 
  uhm ... no ? 
  as long as you do n't let people vote after freshly being deluded by right wing populists during times of international crisis there is very little chance of them voting out . 
  people do , however , vote in favour of a stronger and more united europe already . 
  even during times of crisis . 
  it 's gon na happen sooner or later or the eu dies and with it european countries as a whole will get fucked and everybody living here will be significantly worse off due to it in the long term and we will fall behind significantly in terms of progress and development compared to china , the us and even russia . 
  good . 
  then lets have a referendum that asks * all european citizens * what should be done . 
  no bullshit national referendums . 
  again , no . 
  your arguments do n't follow . 
  first of all : in a representative democracy there is n't an idiotic direct democratic vote on everything . 
  secondly : i doubt informed citizens properly educated about the issue and not being asked during times of shit like a refugee crisis would vote against a federation . 
  thirdly : the eu is n't a dictatorship as long as a majority of eu citizens want something and that thing is being done . 
  if you believe that sometimes forcing minorities to do what the majority wants means a government is n't democratic , then by your logic there is not a single democracy on the planet . 
  well , there are three flaws in your reasoning : 1 . 
  people now finally got kicked in the ass and are actually working on it . 
  and , believe it or not , if politicians actually want to do something it usually gets done . 
  lots of people , including high ranking academics as well as lots of politicians , already have a pretty good idea of how to build such a government , the problem being a lack of political will due to complacency ... until now . 
  the people actually do want it . 
  i already posted this elsewhere , but : if you want to believe statistics on these subjects , the people * do * want a stronger european government . 
  the problem with the current eu is that it 's too weak . 
  the people want a more united and stronger europe with a proper european government , not the self-deluding , diffuse clusterfuck of impotent governance we currently have . 
  here is guy verhofstadt ( prominent member of the alde group ) explaining it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtypteaqgxk `` this type of eu today : you ca n't defend it anymore . 
  europe needs to be reforged . 
  the european citizens are n't against europe , they are against *** this *** europe and the proof of that , mr. president , is the eurobarometer and i 'm asking myself why commission and parliament have not published this eurobarometer far earlier !, 
  you know what the results are ? 
  people : 82 % want more european action on the fight against terrorism . 
  77 % of the european citizens asked for more european action in the fight against unemployment . 
  75 % of the european citizens asked for more european action in the fight against tax fraud . 
  74 % of the european people ask for more european action on the issue of migration . 
  [ in response to ] 14 of the 15 questions put forward to the european people are asking for ** more ** european action . 
  not less european action . 
  what the citizens want is : a european border and coast guard . 
  a european asylum and migration policy to tackle the migration crisis . 
  to have european capacity and intelligence service to tackle terrorism . 
  to have a european government to defend the euro . 
  and to have a european army to defend our borders and to end conflicts in our neighbourhood . 
  * that is what the citizens are asking !, 
  here !, 
  * more of the same will not get us out of this crisis , dear colleagues !, 
  that is burying our heads in the sand !, 
  people want you to work on another europe !, 
  and by not doing that , you are sleepwalking towards a disaster !, 
  towards 27 other referendums in the near future !, 
  intergovernmentalism , a loose confederation of nation states based on unanimity ** can not work !, 
  ** that is the reality of the day that you do n't recognize until now !, 
  [ ... ] our dear union will change or it will die . 
  that is at stake . '', 
  citizens might lose power on a national level . 
  they gain significantly power on an international level . 
  yes , you share control with more people . 
  at the same time you control a huge amount more power . 
  it 's the difference between wielding a sword as an individual and managing an aircraft carrier and its fleet with an entire battalion of people . 
  why choose the sword and fight against everyone else if you can command the aircraft carrier together with others ? 
  it 's not about `` integration '' . 
  it 's about dissolution of intergovermentalism . 
  you are just another citizen of the eu . 
  which , in turn , is just another part of planet earth . 
  having influence on your shitty national government is not as good as having an influence on the government of an entire union . 
  yes , you are sharing your control with more people . 
  but you are also controlling a ridiculously larger amount of power . 
  the only way to get rid of the dominance of germany is to get rid of germany . 
  and all the other nations . 
  if there is only one europe , then `` germany '' is just a random place that everyone else can be equally proud of . 
  everybody has the same rights , the same benefits . 
  `` germany 's '' policies would n't exist anymore . 
  everything would affect everyone in the same way . 
  well , if you want to believe statistics on these subjects , the people want a stronger european government . 
  the problem with the current eu is that it 's too weak .
