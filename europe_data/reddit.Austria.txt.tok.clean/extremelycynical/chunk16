  or `` anyone who says anything against the political status quo as determined by donald trump must be executed immediately . '', 
  is also democratic . 
   it 's the freedom to make democratic choices that should be protected . 
  why ? 
  it 's the freedom of sane , intelligent and educated people not to be negatively affected by the dumb choices of idiots that should be protected . 
  democracy is n't a good thing . 
  let 's not respect dumb choices . 
  the people democratically put stalin at the top . 
  the germans elected hitler in democratic elections . 
  democracy is n't a good thing to begin with . 
  let 's simply not respect it . 
   its going to take a long time until we know whether or not this is a failiure how so ? 
  that 's like saying `` sure , you are dead now , but it 's going to take a long time until we know whether or not shooting yourself in the head is bad for you ... '', 
   that 's going to happen anyway . 
  britain was the counterweight to france-germany and usually sided with smaller and economically less powerful states . 
  the fact that this counterweight is gone alone is going to contribute to more countries seeking to leave a further french-german dominated union . 
  well , then those smaller nations will lose even harder than they already do . 
  the entire reason nations like those in eastern europe make any progress is because nations like germany pump money into them and help them . 
  otherwise they would still be shitholes subjugated by russia . 
  and guess what will happen if the eu fails ? 
  you will bring war back to europe . 
  and it will be [ germany siding with russia ] ( https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/event/europe-destined-conflict ) . 
  and it will be us hegemony dictating inhibitive wars hindering germano-russian progress which will fuck all eastern european nations deeply up the ass . 
  it wo n't be germany or france suffering . 
  it will be the weaker nations getting fucked . 
  all thanks to the `` great britain '' that 's helping them out so much . 
  it 's literally the uk fucking them over this very moment . 
   you do n't just get to `` take away '' a financial center . 
  the reason london is a financial center is because the market has chosen it as one . 
  of course you can take it away . 
  the market chose it due to the benefits found there . 
  that 's why trading using london as a hub must be discouraged through severe penalties . 
   i gave you an example of a disfunctinality in eu which is n't an argument against the eu . 
   you are the one stating people want to leave because i quote they do not know simple math what ? 
  who does n't know simple math ? 
   you are the one stating that the eu is chocolate and flowers . 
  no , i never stated any such thing . 
   the eu point is every member , and every citizen in it should have equal rights and in this particular example that is not the case . 
  why is it not the case ? 
   greece is in this position because , they do not give a fuck . 
  what a sane and reasonable analysis of the situation . 
   because currently there are members from the eu ( ukraine , romania , bulgaria , poland ) that could do with the money the greeks are receiving much better that just put them in that black hole greece is . 
  again : yeah , great . 
  how ? 
  again : punish in what way ? 
  you are just whining and whining and whining yet you provide no real arguments as of what would be superior solutions and why . 
  you sound like the brexit people . 
  totally dumb and without solutions but full of emotion about how everything totally sucks . 
  it 's getting on my nerves . 
  yeah , like everything you ever said in your entire life . 
  you are too dumb to even have this conversation , why do you keep commenting ? 
   but frankly if you are too naive to see how the democracy and self determination works what makes you believe i do n't see how democracy and self-determination work ? 
  i disagree with these concepts . 
  they are shit . 
  are you honestly too dumb to understand the points made ? 
  really ? 
  that 's how fucking dumb you people are ? 
  impressive . 
  are you a broken record ? 
  this . 
  not . 
  democracy . 
   do you expect to be able to vote in the us election as that also effects the eu ? 
  if you want to call it `` democracy '' ? 
  yes . 
  democracy is a shit system and does n't work . 
  you tried to use it as an argument . 
  i repeatedly explained to you why `` mmuh democraccy ! '', 
  is n't an argument . 
  this was n't a democratic decision . 
  this was a decision where a bunch of fucking idiots came together to fuck over the rest of european society . 
  you still do n't get it , do you ? 
   the british population of the 4 british nations decided through a majority decision for britain to leave the eu yes . 
  the british population , which does n't represent the majority of european people . 
  that 's the opposite of democracy . 
   this counter acts your point you previous made as you said that democracy is decided through the majority now your saying that democracy should be ignored for the minority no , i said the exact same thing in both cases : democracy is decided through the majority . 
  the minority of european voters have decided to part with the eu . 
  again , this is not democracy . 
   yet again this is a decision made by britons for britain not the eu fr britain yes . 
  which is n't democratic . 
  it 's like a village in britain deciding `` the uk is shit we are not part of it anymore '' . 
   i guess you think there should be an absolute dictatorship under your then , as you know whats better for britain than the british no . 
  there should be a meritocracy overseen by an international community of specialists . 
  you can whine about these things all you like . 
  it wo n't become an argument . 
  again : punish in what way ? 
   eu should regulate and members not following it 's constitution should be sanctioned some way . 
  yeah , great . 
  how ? 
  smarter and more educated people than you have thought about these things . 
  why do you believe greece even was such a shitstorm to begin with ? 
   yet again this isnt an eu wide decision yes . 
  which is why the vote should n't be called democratic . 
   17million out of 32million is a majority and thats democracy . 
  it 's a disenfranchisement of the european people in favour of an oligarchy . 
   if you believe that the eu should decide the fate of 60million brits then you are an imperialist and have no idea of what democracy and self determination is democracy : ... a system of government ** by the whole population ** or all the eligible members of a state , typically through elected representatives . 
  ... control of an organization or group ** by the majority of its members ** . 
  there you go . 
   the majority of british voters have decided to with dar the uk from the eu . 
  again this is democracy the minority of european voters have decided to part with the eu .
