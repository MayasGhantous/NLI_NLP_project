  the islamists will eventually become western if they join our union for the same reason . 
  the biggest flaw of the eu is that it 's not a proper federation and grants too much sovereignty to individual nations . 
  eu laws should be enforcable by a centrally managed europol and a centralized european army .

  a total of 465 antisemitic * incidences * were recorded , 205 were done on the internet . 
  writing a swastika on a wall is considered an antisemitic incident , for example . 
  neonazis nowadays increasingly do that , yes , so `` the evil immigrants '' are n't the only problem ( nor even a big one ) . 
  not to mention that numbers fluctuate from year to year . 
  2009 there were 200 incidences , 2010 and 2011 there were 70 , now they are higher again . 
  here are the actual crime statistics :  antisemitismus 2014 : 58  antisemitismus 2015 : 41 that 's a decrease of ~ 30 % in actual antisemitic crime from last year to today 's year . 
  overall the numbers are insignificant compared to other crimes . 
  this also does n't even have anything to do with crime of people from new member states so what do you believe is your argument ? 
   the mongols under the great khan conquered china but in the process became chinese . 
  your conquest of the arab world seems likely to end up the same way . 
  people adapting to superior culture is not a loss for humanity . 
  the mongols became chinese because chinese culture was more civilized and the people embraced it for the benefits it brought them .

  they are our young men on our streets now . 
  they are part of the empire . 
  that 's what happens when you conquer other nations . 
  you do n't indiscriminately kill everyone , you make the people part of your empire and make them follow your laws . 
  which is the purpose of the eu . 
  it 's not about winning over their hearts . 
  people who are against the eu are complete idiots and unlikely to change their minds based on reason and logic ... otherwise they would n't be against the eu . 
  it 's about making sure that they understand that leaving * will * have very negative consequences for them . 
  if not due to the general obvious problems leaving would cause then due the sanctions and economic sabotage that will follow and ruin them . 
  yes , traitors . 
  it 's also not `` intimidation '' , it 's a simple statement about how retaliation needs to happen if someone attacks the interests of the eu/human society . 
   '' ... [ a ] ... citizen 's actions to help a foreign government overthrow , make war against , or seriously injure the [ parent nation ] . '', 
  in this case it 's a nation 's actions against its parent union or the act of treason committed by the british people against the union , who would severely injure the eu . 
   outside legal spheres , the word `` traitor '' may also be used to describe a person who betrays ( or is accused of betraying ) his own political party , nation , family , friends , ethnic group , team , religion , social class , or other group to which he may belong . 
  there you go . 
   it drives up house prices , stretches infrastructure resources , the nhs , keeps wages low , as well as innumerable other things . 
  in my opinion levels of migration on this scale are unsustainable . 
  man , seriously ? 
  this reads like buzzwords from a right wing pamphlet . 
  housing prices are driven up by austerity , lack of infrastructure creation and lack of affordable housing regulation ... thanks to right wing politics . 
  i doubt there is a lack of infrastructure resources , do you have citations on that ? 
  what is your point about the nhs ? 
  wages are kept low thanks to right wing politics and lack of worker 's protection and low minimum wages , etc. 
  so ... the solution is n't to vote for even more extremist right wing politics . 
  immigration is n't a problem . 
  immigration managed correctly is a massive boon to a nation . 
  hell , it might not only be a boon but an economic necessity . 
  i 'm not so sure about the uk , but in germany mass immigration is * economically necessary * . 
  germany received a massive amount of immigrants during the so-called `` refugee crisis '' but still needs * far more * than it got . 
  even during during the so-called `` mass immigration event '' the immigration rates were still too low to ensure proper economic stability for their nation . 
   how is punishing the citizens ( really , an entire generation ) of a fellow eu member appropriate ? 
  how are any sanctions appropriate ? 
  how is any way appropriate ? 
  why were nuclear weapons dropped on japan appropriate ? 
  who else is going to pay but the greece people ? 
   you are quite emotional about the unity of the eu when a country wants to leave ( even using the word `` traitor '' to describe them ) i 'm not only emotional , i 'm also rational . 
   but fuck the citizens of one of its members ( and its younger generations in particular ) if it suits you . 
  actions must have consequences , otherwise this shit will be repeated . 
  if you do n't want to give up sovereignty , you will have to pay . 
   the argument that economists , in a broad sense , foresaw the financial crisis is laughable . 
  it 's simply not true . 
  it was n't a `` bubble '' , it was massive , global fraud . 
  of course it was foreseeable and foreseen . 
  it 's what all the evil left wingers told you would happen for decades . 
  and of course it was a bubble . 
  it was an accumulation of bubbles that got brought to bursting by the collapse of the us housing bubble in a massive domino effect , which - like the bursting of the us housing bubble - was also predicted . 
  and it of course was also a massive , global fraud . 
  it 's called capitalism . 
   it is a shame the issue is viewed as a declaration of war by some .
