thx !, 
  in many cases , yes . 
  there were connections between the npd and the nsu-murderers . 
  [ this german newspaper article ] ( http://www.taz.de/!5097815/ ) with the headline `` a party full of criminals '' gives examples : among their officials there is a high count of convictions for aggravated assault among other things . 
  and inciting violence ( which is a crime on its own ) - such as burning down businesses of foreigners . 
  many members have been convicted several times ; but as sentences are usually not for life , they get out after months or years . 
  just because they are n't in prison right now , does n't mean they are n't thugs . 
  in short : locking them up is not that simple . 
  the npd in germany is like that . 
  it 's a group of neonazi thugs . 
  the only reason , why they do n't act like the is is , because there is a working german state that does n't let them . 
  would you wa n't to work with the taliban or the is ? 
  of course they will sometimes have normal views ; perhaps they drink their coffee just like i do . 
  but they are very much defined ( and self-defined ) by that one thing they stand for ( ns ) . 
  i do n't think we should work with the open enemies of democracy and freedom . 
  every valid point they ever present , somebody else already stands for . 
  they offer nothing to any discussion . 
  also , there 's unions who influence the wages and minimum wage . 
  for bigger numbers of people being deported , you can charter whole planes . 
  and yes , syria is a war zone and not safe . 
  that is why syrian applicants have been granted asylum in 95 % or 96 % of cases . 
  perhaps . 
  i do n't know . 
  call me a cynic , but i 'd guess that deportation is much cheaper than the jouney into the union . 
  planetickets are so cheap and people smugglers so expensive . 
  and for the nearer sources of illegal immigration ( looking towards the balkan ) , we might indeed get to see some kind of back and forth wheel . 
  and i believe that would n't be a very new thing either . 
  you just ca n't have propperly organised entrypoints into the union , if the border-members have to shoulder everything alone ( status quo with dublin-iii ) . 
  that 's one reason why i want quotas . 
  the other thing is , that moving somewhere is really no good , if you are n't legally able to stay there . 
  if someone has asylum in memberstate `` x '' then they wo n't be granted asylum in memberstate `` y '' . 
  fair enough . 
  i 've got no idea ; but i 'm obviously not an expert in that field . 
  and then there 'll be a brave and smart young new leader who lets in all the wildlings - because he knows , they are n't the real enemy ( that 'd be the whitewalker-state ) and if left outside , they 'd just add to the numbers of the army of the dead , eventually . 
  accent , backgroundknowledge ... 
  we need a union-whide-quota for that . 
  sounds right . 
  213.200 first time asylum ** applicants ** in q2 2015 and 43.995 of those are syrian . 
  but i want to add , that these particular numbers show applicants , not positive outcomes . 
  ~ ~ i 'd say , the percentage of syrians is higher when talking about asylum applicants with positive outcome - as they have ~ ~ [ here 's the fitting chart for recognition . 
  ( q2 2015 ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/c/c4/first_instance_decisions_by_outcome_and_recognition_rates%2c_30_main_citizenships_of_asylum_applicants_granted_decisions_in_the_eu-28%2c_2nd_quarter_2015.png ) there the syrians make up about 42 % , as i understand it . 
  yes, 
  doing that on purpose would be the same as lying , yes . 
  this story is new to me . 
  the linked article jumps around a lot and i only read most of it . 
  anyhow : it mentioned several news outlets that went on that particular witch hunt - not just the guardian . 
  the way things were interpreted was wrong according to your article . 
  but i do n't really see the guardian * lying * in that story . 
  got any better examples pls ? 
  but they are pretty open about their agendas . 
  also , they do n't * lie * about facts , do they ? 
  have you actually watched the video ? 
  do n't seem very fear-inducing to me . 
  i was not addressing the migration and refugee issue - only the suspension of schengen . 
  we could have that problem solved via quotas , tighter external borders , asylum procedures already on non-union-soil , interventions in the crisis regions , even willingly taking in more people , or any of those things combined . 
  i 'm not a politician , but this seems very much solvable . 
  this is the first major suspension of the open borders rule . 
  do not be alarmed , just because it has n't happened before . 
  the primary eu-law has had rules for such a case for a long time - including the instrument of temporary suspension . 
  right now , there is no indication that this whole theater is anything but temporary . 
  they were at least thinking about it . 
  i think that was part of a bigger move to form an austrian islam - with an official austrian translation of the quran . 
  i think mosques and islam should be accepted as much as churches and christianity . 
  but not saudi mosques . 
  '' * alleged * censorship '' , if you do n't mind . 
  i would like to see actual proof , as / u/czokletmuss offers none . 
  acting on assumptions is of course a difficult tightrope act between not doing the possibly wrong thing and not doing anything at all . 
  but better * proof * than in this case is rare , i 'd guess . 
  and that would almost always leave the option of * doing nothing at all * . 
  it is also important to be aware , that this is not a prison sentence . 
  the user in question is proven to be a racist and proven to not contribute to any discussion . 
   '' [ ... ] swamped with poles , lithuanians , and gypsies . 
  would the ukip repatriate the ones already here or what ? 
  what about non citizen non eu migrants , like africans or asians ? 
  what about people who have british nationality because of the insane open door policies of blair and brown ? 
  is it a `` what 's done is done '' scenario of will they send them ( or a sizable portion - not a token few ) back home ? 
  this is transforming into a country that i do n't wish to live in anymore because of immigration . '', 
  * ( that was not in / r/europe though . 
  ) * and  `` germans are a laughing stock . 
  any respect i had for germany is gone . 
  they just seem absolutely pathetic to me and i am actually embarrassed for them . '', 
  that and the reposted video is his entire contribution to reddit . 
  the 0d is no conclusive proof on its own . 
  it is an indication . 
  but together with other information , it can lead to a pretty complete picture . 
  in this particular case , i think it 's rather safe to assume , that this is the new account of a formerly banned user , or a shill , spouting its agenda . 
  and is banning such accounts not in accordance with the rules ? 
  yes , perfect : that is a great example for an irrational argument , with opinions not based on facts - rather on groundless fear . 
   a wave of objectively criminal , violent people * seriously , man ? 
  definitely not * first and foremost * . 
  i think actual nazis are far worse than people who call other people nazis . 
  xenophobia quite literally means fear of foreigners . 
  that has nothing to do with the * shill * - question . 
  * `` 4.1 this is a moderated forum , to maintain a civil environment , and a high level of debate we reserve the right to actively moderate the subreddit as is reasonable to achieve those aims . 
  '' * that scentence is a bit vague , but grants legitimacy to the act of banning `` troublemakers '' ( in regard to civil environment and high level of debate ) . 
  since ... 
  it 's not . 
  they pay him in brandnew smartphones and sharia laws . 
  the poor bloke had a new and empty account , you know . 
  yeah , like the one that 's been banned .
