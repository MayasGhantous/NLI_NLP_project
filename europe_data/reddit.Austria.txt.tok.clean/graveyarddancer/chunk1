[ rainhard fendrich - i am from austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmsa_xb2h5u ) it 's our unofficial anthem . 
  awesome stuff , thanks . 
  although as much as i like the look of stift melk , i think for austria you should have gone with the schoenbrunn palace & garden in vienna , or the historic centre of salzburg . 
  this would all be well and good if the orf was n't such a steaming pile of shit when it comes to sports coverage . 
  unless rainer pariasek and oliver polzer are really the best we have in austria ? 
  i dare not even think about that ... 
  finally , the one we 've all been waiting for !, 
  damn , ireland 's got some dark-ass fog . 
  and austria m8 . 
  why ca n't people just stop giving a fuck ? 
  how can everyone lose their shit over something as unimportant as who won the eurovision song contest ? 
  it baffles the mind . 
  people ... what a bunch of bastards . 
  yeah !, 
  whooo !, 
  this totally makes up for us not making it to the world cup !, 
  it 's a crossdressing guy . 
  and i do n't know much more than that either ... have n't even heard the song . 
  i live in the uk and see more and more on tv about that dreadful bearded wo/man . 
  oh well , i guess austria has been in the headlines for worse ... 
  it ruins absolutely everything . 
  most people i know are watching most stuff in english now anyway . 
  just thinking about himym , friends or scrubs in german makes me cringe so hard . 
  the problem is , you basically have to buy box-sets or pirate the stuff to be able to watch the original since tv stations refuse to add an english audio channel most of the time . 
  i live in england , thinking about moving back to austria , and honestly , this is actually a factor in my decision making process , haha  ninja-edit : oh god , and the german movie titles . 
  oh god ... edit2 : the simpsons is actually one of the worst shows . 
  while the voice-actors and dubbing is good , the translations are incredibly bad . 
  they tend to translate proper nouns ... `` bed , bath & beyond '' becomes `` bett , bad & dahinter '' . 
  `` dungeons & dragons '' becomes `` kerker & drachen '' . 
  the translators just take it word by word , which results in at least 5 horrible translation-errors per episode . 
  one comes to mind : bart stutters `` but , but , but , but ... '' and it 's translated to `` hintern , hintern , hintern ... '' , the german word for butt . 
  it 's just so bad , how does this happen ?? 
  early morning yesterday i think . 
  i 'm not big on desserts , but i do like a good [ apfelstrudel ] ( http://germanfood.about.com/od/baking/r/applestrudltrad.htm ) . 
  or maybe some nice [ eispalatschinken ] ( http://gesund.co.at/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/eispalatschinken.jpg ) , which is basically a slightly thicker crepe with vanilla ice cream and some chocolate sauce . 
  i 'll leave it to someone else to make a list of all the different types of cakes we do in austria ... far too many  edit : oh , did n't see the wheat-free thing ... good luck with that :d, 
  well , we 've got the traditional christmas market going in salzburg . 
  http://i.imgur.com/gvafvpt.jpg and the famous getriedegasse looks something like this this time of the year : http://i.imgur.com/svr04do.jpg oh and by the way , salzburg looks so similar to ljubljana along the river , it 's ridiculous . 
  and vienna 's mayor said today that he has no clue what all the fuss is about . 
  yup . 
  24 billion missing ? 
  who gives a toss . . 
  austria is so secretive you ca n't even see it . 
  na godseidonk is freitog heast . 
  [ egger ] ( http://pix.austria-onlineshop.com/good/prodpicnr5606-eggerbier-austriaonlineshop.jpg ) is pretty bad . 
  their radler ( shandy ) is even worse . 
  tastes like grandma . 
  dude . 
  again , the smell . 
  i 'm absolutely and 100 % sure i could find that stuff in a blind test . 
  not sure what the german equivalent is , but where i 'm from we 'd call oettinger a grade a `` fotzngschwoabat ''  i 've never tried a discount beer from aldi or lidl but by the sound of it i have n't missed anything . 
  the smell !, 
  that vomity smell when you open the bottle . 
  it haunts me !, 
  it is when you 're high . 
  not perfect , but right now i prefer it . 
  man this is bollocks . 
  22 % fpoe ... at least that reassures me that leaving was the right decision . 
  oh my , i live in london and had the honour of meeting the fine rev. 
  james one weekend in my local pub . 
  he caused me quite a bit of pain the next morning but i have to say , i am quite fond of him . 
  excellent ale . 
  i prefer german beer over austrian , but if i had to pick one it would probably be schnaitl . 
  especially their [ festbock ] ( http://www.lemarkbbc.com/images/bottles/769_schnaitl.jpg ) , which is a stronger , seasonal beer they only do around christmas and easter . 
  most popular are probably stiegl , zipfer , goesser , puntigamer and ottakringer . 
  i kind of like zipfer but am no fan of the other 4 . 
  as someone who used to live very close to the german border and in fact rather close to [ this brewery ] ( http://www.brauerei-schoenram.de/ ) , i 'd have to pick schoenramer helles or gold . 
  that stuff is like heroin to me . 
  but yeah , germany has so many excellent beers , there 's really no way to decide on one . 
  colour is spelled `` humour '' ? 
  man , english makes no sense !, 
  to be honest , apart from the different dialects there 's not much difference between regions . 
  if you want picturesque landscapes , stay in the west ( vorarlberg , tyrol , salzburg , carinthia - also parts of upper austria and styria ) . 
  the eastern parts of austria are mostly flat an boring , but of course you 've got vienna there , the only city of a reasonable size in all of austria . 
  while the other larger cities ( salzburg , graz , innsbruck etc. ), 
  are all beautiful , i can imagine they can get boring quickly . 
  if you want to learn german do n't move to vorarlberg . 
  not even i can understand them , and i 'm a native german speaker - their dialect is closer to swiss german and that 's almost its own language . 
  well , i guess 2 things do come to mind with the peoples : carinthians are oddly proud of their region and tend to think of it a little bit as a country within a country , and viennese people think the world ends at vienna 's borders . 
  everything outside of vienna is all farmers and cow-shaggers ... 
  funny , i moved from austria to england . 
  so you could take my spot over there i guess , 
  then why are you proud of him for doing something he was forced to do anyway ? 
  also , chrisis123 was just making a joke - it goes without saying that no one should have to apologize for a mess previous generations created . 
  uhm ... yeah ... you know , that whole anschluss thing ? 
  we were all like , yeah , let 's do that , great stuff . 
  oh yeah , and special thanks to the vienna academy of fine arts !, 
  good ol' austria - shit just happens 10 years later than everywhere else . 
  listen to this man - [ here 's ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8e1qgg3.jpg ) a picture i took on my trip through scotland last year . 
  i absolutely loved it . 
  yeah , seriously . 
  i live in the uk now and to my friends back in austria i 'm now basically an order-desk for videogames ... 
  yeah it 's true . 
  i got tired of it and moved to the uk . 
  it 's nice here , no mountains to speak of so i finally managed to kill that ever-present urge to climb things all day . 
  1st in physical activity - that 's somewhat surprising to me . 
  what a bunch of wankers . 
  `` hey !, 
  you !, 
  how dare you be gay ?
