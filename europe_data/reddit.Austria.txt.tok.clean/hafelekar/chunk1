austria had to do this . 
  dublin ii is not enforced and there are no controls of the external boarders that deserve that name . 
  denmark , sweden , france and germany have boarder controls . 
  germany is still claiming to have an open boarder policy . 
  but it is not providing a save passage for those people . 
  forcing them to illegally pass the countries inbetween . 
  at the same time germany deports declined asylum seekers to austria . 
  so it is not a complete open boarder policy . 
  austria will always be stuck with those declined by germany . 
  last year it was up to 400 people per day . 
  ( even though germany is doing its controls in a less professional manner , on the highway - more dangerous but political correct - i guess . ), 
  now as the number of migrants had been reduced by closing the balkan route some german politicians claimed it was because of the success of the deal with turkey ?? 
  how ungrateful . 
  now they claim to care about tyrol ? 
  well they do care about the industry . 
  but it is not austria that caused the problem or that is able to solve it . 
  at least we have to try to control those people entering our country even though boarder controls hurt our economy and our hearts . 
  ( edited ), 
  part of the problem is the open invitation of merkel . 
  she has to backtrack . 
  [ greece is accused to not defend its boarders . 
  ] ( http://m.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/a-1073877.html ) at the same time it is said that is `` impossible '' to defend them ? 
  which means de facto we have no boarders towards africa/asia ? 
  the common schengen boarders were the reason why we dismantled our boarders within . 
  was that a big lie ? 
  a union has to be able to defend itself/its boarder . 
  if it is not able to do so , it is a joke . 
  if we are not able to do so , we have to start to try . 
  with all our resources , it should be possible to do that in a human way . 
  so : boarder controls in greece and within europe . 
  it 's not nice , but not as terrible as some say . 
  there have been boarder controls between germany and austria since last summer . 
  if we really ca n't defend the boarders in greece , we have to define new boarders . 
  boarders , we are able to defend . 
  we ( read : germany ) have to make clear , that immigrants are not invited/welcome . 
  refugees , that are genuine have to get asylum in a way/at a place that we define and for a limited period of time . 
  it will get less attractive for migrants to come to europe . 
  our justice system must become tougher towards drug dealers and sexual offenders with multiple convictions . 
  criminals have to be deported/detained as long as they reveil their identity .

  what a wonderful prospect for public space in europe . 
  like the train station linz . 
  the frustrated rejected refugees of europe gather there . 
  that might have been an omen . 
  it 's more about the colours and the design . 
  there are some beautiful houses with tiles in vienna : [ wienzeile , otto wagner ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/wienzeilenh%c3%a4user_von_otto_wagner ), 
  there is really something for everyone in this building . 
  it 's probably not the worst building , but i think this modern hotel is really a failure : [ hotel ramada , innsbruck ] ( http://img.findyourrooms.com/hotels/1454/145476/photos_145476_2014997.jpg ) and that 's a good picture . 
  that building is dark , cold , with weird windows and it `` leans '' toward nothing . 
  there is a run around and an on ramp on the left . 
  someone should support that poor building and prevent its crash . 
  and the architect should have studied fengshui before , or should have used some common sense . 
  yes , like the o-dorf , the ex-olympic village in innsbruck . 
  it 's not beautiful per se , but well maintained and okish : http://tirolatlas.uibk.ac.at/images/10535.jpg, 
  sources for germany 's 50 people per hour cap : [ eu blasts austrias refugee cap as unlawful , deutsches welle , 22.1.2016 ] ( http://m.dw.com/en/eu-blasts-austrias-refugee-cap-as-unlawful/a-19056704 ) [ passau : der konflikt an der grenze zu deutschland , die presse , 27.10.2015 ] ( http://m.diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/4852932/index.do ) [ the same in english ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://m.diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/4852932/index.do&amp;usg=alkjrhjpnd4x1jukyjnnjgyiitejq_1c2g ), 
  it is a sad thing , the world is not improving . 
   stop getting your news from rt. 
  yes , that 's a great defence . 
  are the priests payed by the state in the us ? 
  is there a ministry of religion ? 
  is there support for isis ? 
  in a completely different scenario it would be illegal , yes . 
  but there are plenty of safe countries between austria and afghanistan or pakistan or marokko . 
  if it was illegal , austria could just put all those people that agreed in busses and take them to the boarders of lichtenstein , switzerland and germany . 
  those countries would had to open the boarders for them . 
  and then those countries do the same with france and poland , great britain , denmark , ... btw germany is having a cap on refugees , too . 
  it accepts not more than 50 people every hour per boarder crossing . 
  there are only three border crossings open to refugees . 
  that would be ok , because it 's per hour and not per day ? 
  fun fact : it 's 3600 per day . 
  and germany is bitching with austria ? 
  what a surprise , not . 
  we are not that influential in europe . 
  just as you . 
  policy is made by the big ones . 
  we are just lapdogs and we know it . 
  those sanctions against russia have not been in our interest as well , as russia is an important trading partner and russians are important as tourist . 
  we have seen how greece has been let down and how easily small countries are bullied . 
  so we have to protect ourselves . 
  if we let people pass without control and rules like before , germany can sent them back or block them whenever it wants to . 
  we would be completely in their hands . 
  a problem , as germany is following a migration policy that we do not want . 
  well we can not dream unicorns . 
  we can not bring peace to syria or the world for that matter . 
  ( in austria most of the asylum seekers are in fact from afghanistan ) i do n't think we can trust erdogan . 
  we can not let him guard our boarders . 
  that 's such an insane idea . 
  so i think we should very much restrict asylum . 
  only temporarily . 
  and very much controlled migration . 
  so that it is no longer attracting people , just looking for a better life . 
  it is understandable but not possible . 
  we have to get that enormous pull factor away , i am looking at you germany . 
  i think greece and europe should control the boarders and the land . 
  yes obviously it is difficult . 
  turkey has no interest at stopping the flow of people . 
  we should not sent them billions but use them to controll the boarders ourself . 
  in spain it is possible , too . 
  if we are really unable to do it , we have to redefine our boarders . 
  a union that is unable to control its boarders is a joke .
