sometimes . 
   ... because back then it was not homogenized ... 
  whenever i read this i wonder if people know what homogenization is . 
  try drinking milk with centimeter big lumps of fat and tell me again about those good old times :p, 
  the small countries say njet :p, 
  how is this exhibition framed ? 
  usually i see this kind of unhealthy pc attitude only from usians and other europeans . 
  the real funny side of the story is that it was planned to be the residence of the prime minister when erdogan was prime minister , but it followed him into the presidential office . 
  usually i am not the guy who is outraged about spending for representational buildings but this makes me want to go full pitchfork mob . 
  the term `` founding fathers '' makes me cringe so hard . 
  please do n't use it for the eu again . 
  please , i am begging you !, 
   seem to think that israel 's first and foremost goal should be to please left-ish europeans israel 's first and foremost goal should be to take steps towards peace in the region . 
  sounds fun , great times ahead for the uk , 
  i do n't follow british politics very closely , but is n't this boris character some bizarro-freak , too weird for life ? 
  as harmless and positive as `` free trade '' sounds , it is * potentially * very disruptive and dangerous , especially for all kinds of services that are subsidized in any way or nationalized . 
  for example health care , art , education ... anything where european state money could be seen as providing an advantage to european people and companies . 
  all these things have to be taken care of individually and there is a good chance that there are unforeseen consequences in the future . 
  that 's all i can say without knowing any details of the treaty . 
  i always assumed it is , but i never found it . 
  brie . 
  also parmesan , although that 's expensive if you want a good one that you can eat in any other way than molten on pasta . 
  haha , kinski is awesome .

  [ opus lipdub in kapfenberg ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2thpgwvele ) was a big thing recently .

  maybe british politics is a 3sat/arte collaboration and we are financing it indirectly both via orf fees and eu subventions ? 
  anyways , the show is boring as fuck , 0/10 wo n't watch again . 
  the problem is not this british politics sitcom by itself , but that they have been using the same script for the last 500 episodes . 
  are my tv licencing fees financing this shit ? 
  i really do n't ever want to read `` founding fathers '' in connection with the eu again . 
  so does anybody know wtf ? 
  i am not saying that your own personal little theory there is without * any * merit , but let me try to propose an explanation that is a little more grounded in our reality : what if countries that get into trouble with russia believe that the circlejerk in the west allows them to get away with selling food of a much lower quality ? 
  food for thought ( banned in russia for sanitary reasons ) . 
  please not this again . 
  i am sorry , but this topic is over . 
  so next time somebody argues that all romanians are gypsies it has to go unchallenged . 
  again , i am very sorry for the inconvenience this might cause . 
  the name ? 
  this was in 1990 . 
  transnistria declared independence before russia did . 
  the issue has to be settled before joining the eu , but i think of all these ex-ussr micro states , transnistria is the least concern because they appear to be genuine ussr nostalgists and its population was the driving force of the separation . 
  all others were engineered by russia and are therefor much more difficult to find a solution for . 
  the new title is more sensationalist than the original one , but since he pulled the quote verbatim he was n't sensationalizing . 
  there can be the type of arms race where every side tries to have more tactical nukes in the region than the other party , with the net effect of having * a lot * of nukes there . 
  my immediate reaction is the same , but then cold war ii is really here . 
  maybe there 's still a better solution . 
  ostracizing russia and excluding them from trade is one thing , but an actual renewed nuclear arms race at the border is a whole different story . 
  there are nato nukes in germany and the netherlands . 
  at least i do n't remember reading about them having been moved somewhere else . 
  more whores is not always better . 
  most pimp literature recommends not keeping more than 3 at any time . 
  lol , i think you win . 
  yes , and yes , you can exist on it . 
  after at least 6 months of work , you get up to 6 months unemployment benefit , which is around 60-70 % of your average income in the last 6 months , with a cap of around 1300 $ per month . 
  after that there is `` notstandshilfe '' of roughly 90 % of the unemployment check . 
  on that , i believe , is no time limit . 
  condition for both is that you are able to work and actively looking for employment . 
  under the same condition you can get `` sozialhilfe '' that pays you the difference to 780 $ , should you get less per month . 
  it is not exciting to live on that amount , but it is possible . 
  the gdr was the saddest example for an really existing socialist state . 
  take a german and remove all the vaguely positive sides , as little as there are from the beginning :p, 
  hahaha . 
  that 's going to be fun . 
   feta is made with sheep and goat milk and has to follow a strict standard based on protected designation of origin . 
  the funny thing is that a european union * protected designation of origin * just makes sure where the product is from . 
  you could call anything from the region * feta * if there is no regional authority enforcing ingredients and methods of production or if it does n't care . 
  it makes the guy look like he wanted to give the eu as little credit as possible and went a little too far . 
   ... with ** you 're ** propaganda ... my pro-eu fascism-motivated downvoting is not as bad as my grammar-naziing . 
  unliquify the liquified natural gas at the nearest port and transport it by pipeline ? 
  everybody is welcome to read and comment , but i consider this sub a sanctuary from american shitheadery myself . 
  there is more than enough stupid american shit posted here . 
  now with the russia-thing more than ever . 
  but this is not meant to support the post in the beginning of this comment tree , companies should be held accountable , it does n't matter that nobody was harmed ( yet ) , this is an epic fuckup . 
  nato, 
  i heard in the news yesterday that austria is soon going to sell more barracks and heavy weaponry . 
  rumor says that of the 15 eurofighters there are only 3 operational at any time . 
  this army is n't able to defend the country anymore , anyway . 
  and there is nobody to defend it from , so national defense looks pretty pointless unless you 're preparing for the most unfortunate future where europe finds itself at war with each other again . 
  until that happens no enemy soldier will reach austria and air surveillance only needs to catch the potential few planes that evade the air surveillance of a number of other countries closer to the eu outer borders . 
  the money would be much better used for special tasks the austrian army could be responsible for in a european armed forces . 
  i wonder how defense looks at the eu borders . 
  edit : voted * no , we 're spending enough right now * , because i think the amount of money is not the problem , but how it is spent . 
  oh , is france collapsing again , according to some british dude ? 
  congratulations , you are the most annoying redditor of the day ( 28.09.2014 ), 
   ... bend to eu interests that 's a nice way to put it . 
  bulgaria and romania are the only two eu members that are ** competely ** passive , even czech republic and slovakia show some life signs every now and then . 
  you better post to / r/shitamericanssay directly . 
  if anybody else is curious , this contains a description of the `` characters '' / cultures . 
  i will ask you a single question now and i want to you to think * very * carefully about the consequences before you answer : if the eu says `` jump !, 
  '' , how do you respond ? 
  you will do as the eu says , or you will regret it every second of your remaining life !, 
  this is the last warning !, 
   such irrational barbarism is hard to fathom , ... 
  is n't it the ill-guided , exact opposite of barbarism ? 
  only germany can into humor !, 
  why should the post upset me ? 
  the post did in no way touch me emotionally . 
  i had a lot of economics debates with irish redditors here and this is a very common theme . 
  oh nice , this time i wo n't stand there at the counter wondering if the lady just gave me monopoly money like it happened with the new 5 $ note .
