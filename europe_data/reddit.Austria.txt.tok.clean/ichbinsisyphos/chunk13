  hydro power can contribute a little with pumped-storage power plants , but not enough to not need anything else . 
   sweden is basically energy independent . 
  hydro and nuclear are the main sources . 
  nuclear power can only be used to cover the base load and hydro power mostly ( pumped-storage power plants can only provide so much ) . 
  austria gets almost 70 % of its electricity from hydro power , but we still need gas to cover the peak loads , as most other forms of energy that are not completely unsuitable for short term use in power plants ( ~ hours ) have significantly higher start up times . 
  no , we must not . 
  i have nothing against cooperation with the us , but america and russia are basically the same kind of shithead . 
  the eu has be careful to not be sucked into some cold war revival power game , now more than ever . 
  eu should consider an embargo on everything to russia . 
  goodbye russia , been a pleasure knowing you . 
  * ever closer union * is supposed to sound nice and set the mood for more cooperation within the eu . 
  it does not mean anything specific . 
  i agree in general that , on average , european integration can and should only go in one direction at this point in time . 
  that does not mean that things should be handled centralized in the eu that would be better left to the individual countries themselves . 
  i wo n't accept in the eu what i am not even willing to accept at home , and still i agree with * ever closer union * . 
  why ? 
  because i am not extrapolating the eu as it is now into my worst nightmare of a union , why should i ? 
  and why should you ? 
  i do n't see much point in discussing the common fisheries policy , because i do n't know enough about it and i find it entirely possible that mistakes are made that have to be changed later on . 
  yeah . 
  good that you find something positive in it , but for guys like me it just reinforces the impression that they want to oppose the eu and come up with reasons for it on the way . 
  `` ever closer union '' does not mean completely centralized power . 
  it 's actually kind of ridiculous to read it interpreted like that if you are considering that a lot of countries in europe are federal republics , and therefor living examples of the subsidiarity principle , themselves . 
  i found it incredibly hard and unrewarding to even read through the list , because it 's just the same old bullshit repeated again and again in a futile attempt to make him look less like a blabbermouth and to pretend there are any actual ideas for improvement and valid criticism of the union coming from the brits - ** it failed ** . 
  and i would like to use this opportunity to repeat again that the european court of human rights is not an eu institution but one of the council of europe . 
  uk is bound by it because they signed it . 
  thank you for your attention . 
  : i could just change a couple of words and say the same to the `` free benefits '' point , but i doubt it would be worth the effort . 
  is this some weird kind of sarcasm ? 
  about 25 % of all posts from polish people on this sub is about how they are offended by the mention of the holocaust , because poles , too , died in wwii . 
  going by the comments here whenever somebody publishes photographs of the country , lithuania must be a real gold mine for psychotherapists . 
  when i was already well into adulthood i learned that there was once a movie called * the sound of music * , i also heard that many people around the world got their idea of what life in austria is like from that movie . 
  austria is maybe the only country on the planet where almost nobody knows of the existence of the movie . 
  also the * watschenplatter * is not really a traditional dance , but a very recent invention for tourists . 
  is it me or are all those 8 `` scenarios '' complete bullshit ? 
  who are those people ? 
  well , sanctions ... cut the ties with russia , get rid of the energy dependence , get involved in the situation in the ukraine and try to work towards a solution , isolate russia in the future , build up a european military , avoid cowering behind the us . 
  `` sanctions '' sounds inappropriate when you are dealing with a lunatic . 
   russia , he said , was open to further dialogue with the west if it was `` honest and partner-like '' . 
  `` go fuck yourself , pathetic shithead '' , how 's that for a dialogue ? 
  :p it 's 2003 all over again , those people live in a fantasy world . 
  ohh , yeah it 's there . 
  i was looking under `` options '' as described in the link in the response to my original post . 
  yep , i can enable the captions for the video ( in russian ) , i can just not have them auto-translated . 
  no , but i 'm on linux using google 's own flash replacement in chromium . 
  maybe that it 's related to that . 
  either that or i am blind . 
  i do n't have this translate captions option . 
  what youtube captions translate option ? 
  there is no anti-eu party in all of europe that i can take serious . 
  the eu is far away , not very well understood in many member countries and therefor a perfect scapegoat for everything . 
  there are three main tactics how the several parties ( whether their actions are pro or contra eu ) are using this : ** 1 ) ** government parties implement not overly popular policies and justify it with pressure from the eu . 
  ** 2 ) ** ( mainly opposition ) parties try to turn every vague feeling of discontent in the country against the eu to gain support in the national elections . 
  ** 3 ) ** government parties actively try to create anti-eu sentiment in the population to have more leverage in eu-negotiations . 
  it 's the sad truth of eu politics , if in an unanimously decision all members but one agree on something there is a higher chance that the others give in to more demands just to get the decision through . 
  from a purely opportunistic standpoint it would be stupid not to do it . 
  are you happy with this kind of thinking ? 
  to back away from every threat ? 
  what 's going to stop the next similar step by russia ? 
  the interests of russia in the ukraine takes the backseat compared to the interests of the ukrainians . 
  that 's a completely bullshit argument , like there is some kind of right to force another country into being a vassal state or a buffer zone . 
  i do n't care too much about crimea . 
  getting russians out from there would have always been difficult in the best case . 
  additionally it is not a part of the ukraine for long and i have no idea whether ukrainians at large even have an interest in keeping it . 
  and if the country , in the upcoming elections , ca n't find a government that both the east and west are happy with , a split of the country seems inevitable . 
  the way it has been handled by russia is completely unacceptable , though . 
  it rules them out as future partners in whatever , if you ask me . 
  poland continues to disappoint . 
  11bn now are not the same as 11bn then . 
  now there is a chance that it does some good and does n't just fill the pockets of a lot of corrupt people . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desertec it sounds like you could find this interesting . 
  it 's of course a long term project . 
  let 's not even think about letting russia 's threats make any difference . 
  you know , if it means sleeping in a thick winter coat for two winters in a row until we get gas from alternative sources i 'd be ok with it too . 
  and that is by far the most leverage they have , a country that threatens to confiscate private property in a way like that is not a business partner you want to have anyway . 
  judging just from the couple of words i watched of her on tv , without knowing anything else , full agreement . 
  he 's bringing all of the world up against russia , that 's the disaster . 
  chechnya , georgia ... all this was justifiable if you look just a little beyond the short stories reported in the western media . 
  occupying ukraine is not . 
  just like the us , russia will now have to learn - the hard way - that old glories of the cold war are over and that the power that comes from natural gas resources is not infinite . 
  as tragic as it was , it was mismanagement , and it did by far not only affect the ukraine . 
  some good points , but do n't try to sound too much like a conspiracy theorist and the idea that holodomor was done on purpose does n't do your credibility any favors either . 
  nope , the plastic crown stuff is from a show called [ * wir staatsk\u00fcnstler * ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wir_staatsk%c3%bcnstler ) , know for satirizing ( mostly austrian ) politics . 
  they are rather popular . 
  i have honestly never heard the name * chris stephan * , the one with the blackface , before . 
  i am pretty sure it was not an accident . 
  the previously utterly unknown alleged comedian and kim are in the headlines . 
  i guess only lugner was n't in on it . 
  also , redbull salzburg concedes a goal while destroying ajax amsterdam again 3:1 in the return match . 
  : lol , completely missed the kim kardashian blackface drama . 
  this site is pretty definitely not made by ukrainians . 
  i am about as pacifistic as they come , and i would have preferred a good relationship with russia over the us any time , but an invasion of the ukraine in this day and age is completely sociopathic and it is stupid even if you have russia 's interests in mind . 
  they can not reach their goals by brute force . 
  all this can possibly achieve is that ukrainians are denied their self-determination for a little while until the next revolution . 
  i honestly have no idea what russia is hoping to achieve here , but europe/nato can not stand idly by this time . 
  it would also mean that scotland 's border with the uk would become an external border of the schengen region , which scotland would be required to secure . 
  maybe it would be a good idea to wait for the british referendum and set things straight between the uk and eu before finalizing the treaties with scotland . 
  the only easy way would be if scotland is granted a schengen opt-out right away , but that 's the shittiest possible outcome for the eu . 
  is this the 15th or 16th time ? 
  i lost the count around 5 . :p what is this for all of the time ?
