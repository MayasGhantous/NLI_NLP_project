  what 's the problem with khat ? 
  from what i 've read it is comparable to caffein , the problems with it are more economical - it supposedly displaces cultivation area for other crops and people spend a lot of money on it . 
  so , why should it be banned any more than coffee or wine ? 
  that 's the debating * training * you do in british ( and similar ) schools . 
  i find this public debating , where everyone picks a side , pretends to support it religiously and tries to sell this fake opinion to others , extremely pathetic . 
  most of the time * eastern europe * refers to the warsaw pact states , buddy . 
  always glad to help our friends ** from the east ** !, 
  some previously under-reported eastern european countries ca n't handle all the attention they are getting nowadays . 
  another country comes to mind - out of fear from downvotes i wo n't say its name but it starts with `` polan ... '' . 
  it was a little bit more complicated , buddy . 
   even if europe will allow membership it is just a mater of time before ukraine 's economy crumbles and becomes another dead-weight . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the least developed economies in the eu have always been relatively stable during the crisis , because the growth potential remains high no matter what . 
  it 's the more average economies that struggle because they already have to do more to keep growing and they are not yet strong enough to do so . 
  if the ukraine meets the eu 's terms , i am willing to assume that corruption and other counterproductive behaviors are solved . 
  that there is a huge economical potential for both the ukraine and the eu there should be completely obvious , even more than for poland back then , the ukraine is unnecessarily poor in my opinion . 
  however i am more and more in favor of a slower expansion of the eu . 
  a lot of the more recent additions seem to be primarily interested in eu funds , it is necessary that there is some evidence that they support the european idea , at least later on . 
  edit : ouch :p  [ this article ] ( http://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-protests-what-you-need-to-know-2013-12 )   yet four of the five countries on its western border -- poland , ** slovenia ** , hungary and romania -- are eu member states . 
  why is the hair relevant , i 'd say the arms are relevant , because now ukraine does n't go with the eu as obviously . 
  what of the hair did i miss that is not said with the ukrainian colors ? 
  schwarz-rot-gold , in this order , alter . 
  is of good idea . 
  germany of genius . 
  russia has eyebrows for christ 's sake !, 
  i was n't able to confirm anything independently , so i ca n't even be sure if it is a recent picture and where it was taken , the picture itself seems to be legit . 
  i think krokodil is by definition fucked up by combining it with other ingredients . 
  none-fucked-up krokodil is called desomorphine , 
  people from the former soviet union are just bad at coming up with titles . 
  the photographer calls the album `` red journey '' , the headline of the article is coming from some russian journalist . 
  do you really want to force me to call you two idiots ? 
  the dude is a photographer , a photographer makes photos , interesting photos , photos nice to look at . 
  nowhere did anybody state that everyone in vilnius is a drug addict , that prostitutes in tomsk dress poorly and that everybody in vladivostok is a blonde bimbo . 
  it is neither his duty nor in his or in his audience 's interest to give `` a balanced view '' of a country . 
  has anybody of you ever been in vladivostok ? 
  i only know a couple of pictures , but they look incredibly fascinating . 
  there 's probably not much going on there , but i probably will have to go there for a few weeks holiday in the not too distant future . 
  i also think `` he 's probably not meaning it bad '' . 
  mostly because i can make no sense of the jew-part . 
  you have to remember that this was a non-public meeting . 
  asylum-seekers in a small village of maybe 2000 people means a lot of work and stress , journalists mean work for politicians too . 
  if he has to vent in a semi-private setting from time time , so be it . 
  he basically got flagged for the use of the `` jew '' - keyword and was made to resign `` voluntarily '' for it . 
  it 's probably for the better , but let 's read what he said carefully and not make more of it than it is . 
  to be honest it does n't make much more sense with `` juden '' either . 
  he did n't say somebody should be hanged like the jews , he said they are like the jews . 
  and i honestly have no idea what he meant with that , other than that the word `` jews '' was used in contempt . 
   try ordering a paradeiser ... in northern germany or a fleischpflanzal in vienna  that 's the only strictly bavarian word i remember from my school excursion to minga . 
   the question if something is racist ca n't be decided by the majority . 
  how else would you decide that ? 
  do you think there is anything to this that can be decided objectively ? 
  i do n't . 
  no more mises.org for you today . 
  it fucks your head up . 
  placing the baltics in the south is a mistake i find hard to make . 
  and i thought all americans would at least find russia ( of course one called it u.s.s.r. ) . 
  anyways , very untypically american , too humble , ignorance alone is not what defines an american , you have to be ignorant ** and ** obnoxious about it . 
   and it is now a better idea to take the academic route if you want a good job . 
  conventional wisdom agrees but my personal experience objects furiously . 
  all my academic education in life was pointless , it only made later vocational training easier than for other people , at the cost of a wasted life :p but vocational training has changed in the last decade , too . 
  it used to be for lazy people , but lazy people are now jobless . 
  have you ever re-read one of your own posts after you calmed down ? 
  the eu-ukraine-russia media battle of the last few weeks was completely retarded , but i would have downvoted your posts too , if i did n't avoid the ukraine threads recently . 
  because that 's what you do when `` they contribute nothing to the discussion '' . 
  what did the post say ? 
  you have a nice country there would n't it be a shame if it freezed to death ? 
  3 different european things in one ad ? 
  mind . 
  blown . 
   here is one in bristol . 
  what am i missing ? 
  what is this thing good for that a simple crossing ca n't do better ? 
  is n't that the point of roundabouts , to not have traffic lights ? 
  not sure if i 've ever seen a roundabout with traffic lights in my life . 
  i think it is safe to say that should anybody feel the need to criticize british newspapers for being biased in any direction whatsoever , the bbc should be the very last on the list . 
  which does not mean that i am exactly blown away by its quality journalism . 
   they did n't though who or what did/didn ' t what or whom ? 
  you could say that nobody expected the scale of wwi . 
  and wwi was called `` the war to end all wars '' , but people somehow managed to get over it , 
  it is not a country ( by no definition ) , whether it is a federation , a confederation , something entirely new or nothing really yet is heavily debated based on the definitions of words . 
  i 'm not going to be able to explain the eu in a reddit post and i am not going to try . 
  the main difference to for example the us is that it is a union of sovereign countries . 
  the eurocrats sit there and try to come up with how to allow eu members to cooperate over national borders in a way that is agreeable for everybody . 
  if an agreement is found , it issues * regulations * or * directives * ( that the member states are required to forge into national law ) . 
  the member states are free to administrate as they want or as they always did , as long as eu law is met , so you find that they are subdivided in completely different ways . 
  at the same time at eu policy often considers various `` regions '' , often across borders , that are economically or culturally connected , like for example the border regions of france and the uk divided by the channel . 
  the most important institutions are * the * european parliament * ( as the name implies , legislative , represents the citizens , elected every 5 years ) * the * council of the european union * ( legislative , one minister per member state , rotating presidency ) * the * european commission * ( proposes new laws , one commissioner per country assigned to a certain field a bit like national ministers ) * the * european council * ( heads of states of the member states : policy ) * the * court of justice of the european union * then there 's also the * european central bank * and the * court of auditors * . 
  note that there is also the council of europe , which is not an eu institution . 
  i think most people will agree that the eu is a bit of a mess , mirroring brussels to some extent  because it is a work in progress . 
  maybe somebody wants to elaborate . 
  i 'm curious how you would choose yugo 's battleform . 
  `` russian poster '' . 
  without a source , explanation or context . 
  if i look on the right side , which just as exaggerating as the the left side almost only shows `` long gone glories of the past '' , i doubt it is from russia . 
  i also doubt it is meant as propaganda . 
  * should really be called greater prussia . 
  * they like to w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk . 
  everybody is busy like a bee and modest and they always pay the bills of the inferiour countries because they are just awesome like that . 
  * adolf hitler was german ( as opposed to ludwig van beethoven ) . 
  * jfk was a berliner , which is really just a specific type of german .
