  * continue to show the world how cars are meant to be built : mercedes , bmw , audi , volkswagen * building great panzers is something they can not unlearn . 
  * the football is good there , too . 
  a funny anecdote : rapid wien is german champion of 1941 , 0:1 until the 80th minute and 3 goals in the now famous `` rapidviertelstunde '' . 
  * i remember watching the fall of the berlin wall in tv , the maybe first and only emotional german moment in the post-war period . 
  yes , as always , the germans are always portrayed as the angels . 
  you know , downvoting stuff critical of your country does n't change anything . 
  you should n't blindly support the actions of polish officials in every case , but support the actions you agree with and reject the ones you do n't . 
  try it , you might like it . 
  and maybe also start rejecting - not all - but the most embarrassingly retarded propaganda you are force-fed . 
   and also to mention that those boobs , boobs , boobs would n't even be visible in an actual , traditional outfit they 're trying to `` recreate '' . 
  damn !, 
  i was hoping there 's a secret slavic dirndl culture i 've been missing all my life . 
  definitely custom made . 
  you need to find a `` maskenschnitzer '' and/or a tailor , talk to them about your ideas and give them both large sums of money . 
  where 's austria ? 
  btw , it 's funny , i remember that most of my life bank secrecy was sold to us as a right of little grandmothers to keep the exact amount of their couple of saved schillings private , because that 's nobody else 's business . 
  i do n't remember this ever being publicly questioned until a couple of years ago . 
  you know , that poland will get over itself and play nice with the other kids . 
  there 's a lot of positive sides to the polish identity , they are well grounded people and hard workers above all , now they only need to get out of their heads that everybody is against them ... the eu , russia , atheists , gay people , everybody else , ... and things will look much better . 
  hahaha . 
  love it as a joke , although i do n't wish anybody to grow up like that . 
  to be honest , there are some hard feelings towards poland . 
  in european and global politics , poland is basically a sociopath . 
  they take and do nothing but bitch in return . 
  only after this one plane crash things calmed down a bit . 
  but besides that there is also a lot of good faith in that things will eventually get better . 
  and we can only hope so , as soon as poland is fully developed and carries more economical power , antics like some ten years ago will be way more painful . 
  i am not sure of the uk , but i definitely do n't see this tendency anywhere else . 
  i do n't know if you linked the wrong video , but that 's not annoying to me at all . 
  no offense , but get it over with already . 
  spain , italy , france , ... and two more equally boring countries ? 
  :p ok , ** the french like baguette and many of them are mimes ** . 
  it 's a quite ambitious country for european standards , as far as their global influence is concerned : active independent nuclear weapons program , main force behind the ariane rocket , many other high tech weapon programs outside of the mainstream european cooperations , does n't buy from the us either like britain , a bit of a not-developed-here syndrom in that regard . 
  some left-overs from colonial times , their unwillingness to let them go was reason for a lot of global unrest after wwii ( vietnam , algeria , ... ) . 
  protective of their language . 
  sweet jesus . 
  famous for their wines and strange high cuisine ( corn fattened goose liver and pressed duck :p ) you probably do n't want to be a kind of bird in france . 
  well balanced mix of industrial/high tech/agricultural economy and culture . 
  good work/life balance . 
  the have the goriest national hymn i remember right now . 
  the french revolution was important to facilitate political change and end feudalism all over europe . 
  napoleon almost managed to undo the revolution and was generally a bit of a bitch to their european neighbors . 
  he once conquered vienna and left a couple of days later , probably just for the bragging rights . 
  but they survived napoleon and later even charles de gaulle , who was again ousted in a mini-revolution when france took 1968 a lot more serious than other countries . 
  funny , just yesterday i read that europe is currently moving a bit to the left and that the social democratic block is the favorite in the next eu elections . 
  vorarlberg wanted to join switzerland after wwi . 
  there is a tyrolean separatist movement ? 
  a friendly reminder : * people from different cultures and ethnicities can be different in looks and behaviour * black people have black skin ( ! ), 
  * people are sometimes curious about it . 
  that 's not racism , it 's never ever going away , and it 's not worth fighting against . 
  * the only possible way to fight it would be mass lobotomy . 
  * teenagers are sometimes embarrassing themselves and each other . 
  * journalists can sometimes be whiny bitches , too . 
  it might be the beer talking , but / r/europe needs more rs2k :p, 
  only individual vehicles ? 
  i thought the wiener linien , the company as a whole . 
  why should serbs be allowed to vote in kosovar elections ? 
  what am i missing here ? 
   the town of vienna is going to buy 150 new tramways is n't the tramway privately owned and only leased to the viennese government ? 
  or did they buy it back or what ? 
  uhum . 
  i see , you appreciate a good joke . 
  germany changes its mind and wants italy to join again , because japan has gone full kawaii . 
  ** wtf ** you know , at the end of all the episodes you listed , the stuff you wrote yourself , where italy switches sides and betrays its original allies ? 
  that 's where * italy betrayed anyone * . 
   never trust italy in a war . 
  do you know this ? 
  i have no idea what he is trying to say . 
  that 's nice . 
  you seem to be a very nice guy . 
  i got a lot out of this interesting discussion . 
  thanks again . 
  because china is in the eurozone ? 
  yes ? 
  i apologize in advance if i am missing some obvious point here . 
  i remember her/him/hen from last year , but she/he did n't qualify , or austria was n't allowed to participate , or bearded drag queens or whatever . 
  to be honest my memory of the last eurovision song contest is bit dizzy . 
  the point is , it 's a bit late for a scandal . 
  and i sincerely hope there are more outrageous costumes this time . 
  in the long term we have to find a solution that allows to re-adjust national economies within the euro zone without exchange rates . 
  devaluing currencies against each other has the same effect as exchanging money , it 's just better to sell to the population . 
  but for now , if germany would loosen the reins at home just enough so that increase in domestic demand makes up for loss in exports , nobody would lose anything , but europe as a whole would be in much better shape . 
  hello !, 
  nice to meet you , have a nice stay !, 
  the us has always supported germany 's economic policies , i am well aware of its problems . 
  i agree completely but the us can shut its face . 
  this is only a counter-attack against the recent statements of german politicians on the nsa-scandal . 
  it 's an irrational fascination , ca n't explain it , but it has nothing to do with flags . 
  i do realize that it is risky . 
  i am thinking about moving to latvia at some point , but i have no idea how to finance it and how to survive , which makes it probably more of an retirement plan . 
  i am also planning to get some abroad work experience once i have enough expertise in my line of work . 
  no idea where , though ... southern europe , scandinavia or south america are on my list . 
   gennady onishchenko left his position ( or was fired ) , now someone else has to take a role of russian economic war chief ; hmm , what 's going on ? 
  is there internal opposition to the russian trade disputes , or was onishenko sick of it ? 
  nothing . 
  oh wait , the flag is really nice . 
  really , really nice . 
  that 's it , i give up . 
  yepp , very . 
  that 's isdn speeds ...
