  oh , yes , the beer that got us that drunk was awesome too . 
  is this like `` whatever , europe '' , as in a dismissive attitude towards europe ? 
  until now i tried to avoid watching the video , but i have to admit it is funny . 
  fucking foxes , what do they say ? 
  nobody knows . 
  it 's not a matter of survival , but multiple time zones are not ideal , if the distances are n't that big . 
  + / -1 hour is no problem to group in one time zone . 
  spain is a weird case , because a large part of it is the the west of the uk , but it uses the time zone for the east of the uk . 
  you can see in the image that it is actually very uncommon that time zones align with the theoretical longitude ranges , political and economical considerations are more important . 
  anyways , there are at least 4 time zones on the european continent . 
  edit : one more thing , the image seems to exaggerate the situation . 
  greenwich is in the south-east of britain , england is to my knowledge completely within utc +0 , only northern ireland peaks out . 
  almost all of spain is in utc +0 too , except a small patch above portugal . 
  i 've always been the more rebellious type :p, 
  sounds as insightful as `` das runde muss in das eckige '' . 
  ahh , football players ... 
  look what you have done . 
  `` not everything hitler did was bad . '', 
  i guess that can be found in germany just as often . 
  i remember my grandfather saying it once , but i guess it has gone out of fashion now . 
  you could write a dissertation about this sentence , it sums up the post-war sentiments rather nicely . 
  it is completely true , but it is also used to a ) justify the more `` bad '' actions during the national socialist period and b ) keeps people receptive for the ideology . 
  i ca n't think of other shitaustrianssay right now . 
  does the ukraine pay market prices now ? 
  it was talked about a lot , but i do n't remember it being put into practice . 
  ultimately , no . 
  europe does n't have the cheap energy * the * ukraine currently gets from russia . 
  everything else , maybe . 
  do you realize by how many orders of magnitude the power of the eu would have to grow to notice a difference between left and right ? 
  this has been posted already . 
  what i still wonder the most is why i do n't read any public backlash from dutch people here . 
  of course i do n't know what happened up to this speech and if they were prepared , maybe a majority even agrees , but for me this seems like a slap in the face out of nowhere , and an incredibly hypocritical one at that . 
  are those people that are already registered , with residence in sweden , and/or people with the swedish citizenship ? 
  initially i thought they registered people of whom official nobody else would know they exist there , but some of them appear to be somewhat public figures ? 
  stra\u00dfe is written with '' \u00df '' . 
  the change was after i left school , and that 's the only time you really concern yourself with grammar , but i think the rule is '' \u00df '' after long spoken vocals and `` ss '' after short ones . 
  you said something of a map collection of the time magazine , i assumed you meant online ... 
  i am sorry , but this is a european subreddit , i have to ask you guys to leave . 
  you are not the kind of dude who believes in providing links ? 
  the voice of an angel . 
  is n't that true for everybody in same position as merkel ? 
  a baguette ? 
  yes , they do work , but the original link works now too . 
  incredibly aggressive behavior of the russians . 
  there 's an exercise and they come and observe it like the big , fat bullies they are . 
  they will not rest until sweden is part of a new ussr . 
  yes . 
  they are all highly successful one-trick-ponies  that 's what i am thinking of , the more diverse an economy the more you depend on all sorts of exchange with others . 
  they could too , but they do n't have to . 
   in what country/culture would you feel most at home ? 
  this is a crucial sentence . 
  one would assume that austria is closest to germany , culturally , they even use a corrupted version of our language !, 
  i 've never been to a place in germany , where i would like to settle , though . 
  if i had to choose one of those three , i would probably take my chances with france , but ideally i 'd like a 4th option somewhere to the east . 
  they took it offline for some reason , it 's nowhere on the site . 
  patience . 
  small nations have a overproportional voice in the eu , as overall influence is a compromise of one per country and per population . 
  micro nation or not is not the issue , whether their economy allows them to isolate themselves or not , counts . 
  liechtenstein can , switzerland can , norway can , iceland for a while longer , all others not so much . 
  it 's hard to say anything about it without spoiling it , though . 
  kontroll is an incredibly cool movie , at least when i saw it back then . 
  i liked taxidermia very much , too . 
  the remote usually pisses people off  i am not sure if the 1997 version was dubbed in english , but in 2007 there was a remake made in the us , with english speaking actors , but also haneke as director . 
  * michael haneke * vergletscherungstrilogie : * [ der siebente kontinent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_seventh_continent_\\ ( 1989_film \\ ) ) * [ bennys video ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benny%27s_video ) * [ 71 fragmente einer chronologie des zufalls ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71_fragments_of_a_chronology_of_chance ) * [ funny games ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/funny_games_\\ ( 1997_film \\ ) ) alle sp\u00e4teren filme waren eher europ\u00e4ische projekte in \u00d6sterreich / frankreich/deutschland , abgesehen vom us remake von funny games . 
  looks like they are trying to build an orthodox vatican in bucharest . 
   ukrainians who would rather look west . 
  the western ukraine does ... 
  salo and vodka . 
  lots of it . 
  been nice knowing you . 
  fare well , sweet prince . 
  this is all not very convincing . 
  '' * under certain conditions * '' , '' * could ease * development of military applications '' , '' * potential * weapon of mass destruction '' ... and then they hope people do n't think too deeply about it . 
  tritium is relative harmless , as radioactive materials go . 
  minimizing the contamination by neutron radiation is what can be figured out once iter is running . 
  in the best case it will mostly produce more tritium that can easily be separated in centrifuges and reused as fuel . 
  iter is a research reactor , you know . 
  one reason why i opposed a new fission reactor building spree is because i believe renewable energy can bridge the gap until fusion is ready . 
  islamification of norway !, 
  well , that 's the standard accession process . 
  goals are set and their progress measured . 
  the accession happens if all goals are met . 
  although after croatia , the eu should probably finish with a waiting period and look if the countries can keep it up for a couple of months :p, 
   up to leaving iter and euratom . 
  why ? 
  are they insane ? 
  because of the cost or what ? 
  oh , is the damn money not coming fast enough ? 
  poor croatia . 
  for these guys the eu does n't seem to be much more than a pot of money . 
  did they just call the turks faggots ? 
  where do you have the translation for intellect for turkey from ? 
  i ca n't make any sense of `` oben au\u00df '' . 
  the `` that 's why we ca n't have nice things '' - line of thought is deeply flawed and * extremely * pathetic . 
  the implied submissiveness to authority in this kind of thinking makes me sick . 
  not even penis-shaped :(, 
  throwing your kielbasa into europe 's biggest sausage fest . 
  `` low taxes '' . 
  are invaded by switzerland on a regular basis . 
  looks more like a general jihadist flag .
