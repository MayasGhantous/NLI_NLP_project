  even a opinion you disagree with can lead to a good debate , but if it is downvoted , the whole comment tree is buried . 
  i guess i am guilty of this too , but not because i disagree , but because i am sick of reading the same old bullshit all over again and again . 
  what i also hate are polish information campaigns about the `` death camps '' , romanians helpfully informing us about gypsies , all these national fantasies at odds with the rest of the world . 
  i thought about proposing to get rid of the flags , but where 's the fun in that ? 
  there is also not much creativity/original thought here anymore . 
  of course the xenophobic raids are getting worse and worse , too . 
  i guess it is still a good place to get informed about european matters and to browse while watching the eurovision song contest , / r/eurovision is a bit too weird for my taste . 
  quality post . 
  lulz @ this whole thread . 
  it * is * an incentive . 
  actually there is no real reason to leave church before you have to pay the tax . 
  if religion does n't mean much to you and you receive your first bill , the decision to leave the church is quickly made , actually it 's top priority from that point on , so that the fuckers do n't take any more of your money . 
  it can also influence the decision later on . 
  maybe you wanted to marry in a church . 
  maybe your children are baptized and you 're not planning on having more , ... 
  in austria a self-service car wash cost 10 schilling and then 1 euro . 
  prices rose by 37.6 % !, 
  does n't make the reference any clearer . 
  i do n't know in which way he was involved in the scandal , but if he survived it back then , it 's not going to cause him any problems now 16 years or so later , especially not from his own party . 
   heck , even zagreb is more to the west than vienna . 
  austria is n't traditionally counted towards western europe anyway . 
  for geographical reasons and in the cold war it was between the blocks , too . 
  you can count it towards western europe if you want to refer to an area in europe with the highest development , or if you 're going by culture . 
  of course , politically , it is no longer between east and west either , after the end of the cold war . 
  former yugoslavia is n't called eastern europe either , but southern europe , nowadays the term south eastern europe is popular . 
  lol, 
  maybe eurozone negotiators felt they can not publicly accept radical greek proposals , so they pushed through a deal with the goal to accept radical imf proposals afterwards instead . 
  selling a port to a shipping line is a funny idea though . 
  the state owing central infrastructure means that the competition utilizing it is fair . 
  what ? 
  there 's looking for one 's own interests and there 's forcing a zero-sum-game on everybody . 
  i think this whole episode will be very hard to get over , if it is possible at all . 
  until a few days ago it was only some angry talk , now greece has to make the choice of suffering many many more years or turning their backs on europe , a finnish party is forcing the choice of breaking up the government or dropping greece ... 
  what good would it have done if syriza had n't tried ? 
  do you honestly believe that the path the troika has set greece on is going to work out ? 
  or , do you believe that austerity is doing the rest of the eu any good ? 
  austria is being held back by it , that much i know . 
  i 'd guess it 's that longes personally pissed off quite some people during the ukraine thing . 
  and then , of course , not everybody has to like a pr campaign for russia , for more or less the same reason . 
  oh , i am aggressive ? 
  nice to know . 
  the downvote is from me . 
  well , i have no magnets on my fridge . 
  why should i ? 
  serious question . 
  i have [ one of those made from cork ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ddtfcvx.jpg ) which , i assume , serves the same purpose . 
  \\ #swissproblems, 
  here you go . 
  edit : what the fuck is going on , why do you guys plaster your fridge with magnets ? 
  have they been caught stealing and is theft their main source of income or are we talking about not paying a can of coke in the shop once ? 
  are you trying to make this copypasta ? 
  there are two kinds of roma here : the ones that are n't even recognizable as roma unless you ask them because they have a job and a normal life , and the ones that come here to beg and steal . 
  this is how the pr is fucking up public discourse . 
  ** sending more money to greece was never in question ** , by nobody who is in any position to make decisions . 
  of course the public opinion is shaped that way because a mob does n't have to know what it is doing , does n't have to have a clear goal , they just have to be angry . 
  the troika wants greece to continue on the current path in exchange for more money and greece wanted to try a different route . 
  the argument was that the money gifts this way only keep greece afloat without a chance of long-term improvements . 
  not only the in the past months , the greek-debate in germany is full of hate from the very beginning of the crisis . 
  you have to witness normal people in a restaurant talking about how `` the greeks '' do n't work , do n't pay taxes and go into retirement to early , and now `` the germans '' have to pay for it , and all the other shit that has been brought up , it 's surreal . 
  yes you can , actually you have to . 
  inside of greece things will simply have their value , but they get cheaper in euros . 
  exports are attractive , because again , they are cheap in euros , but imports will be prohibitively expensive . 
  well , i ca n't think of any more hostile action inside of a currency union right now , so greece would be fucked , as fucked as the rest of the euro zone can fuck them up . 
  yes  ** some backbencher ** in greece allegedly said ** something ** , the ** telegraph ** reports . 
  to avoid this looking hostile to you ... 
  i have no idea whether this statement happened and if , by whom , but we do n't have to take every insane chatter as fact . 
  you can find literally every single possible opinion on every possible topic in some online publication , even if they have to make it up . 
  the old proposal is definitely off the table , that includes the possibility of there being no agreement at all , though . 
  this sub is now even more chaotic on this topic than usual . 
  there is a thread currently going on , talking about greece counterfeiting euros . 
  yes . 
  meidei used to have a cyprus flair in the past . 
  exactly , the troika 's intimidation no longer works now . 
  the troika did n't move ~ ~ an inch ~ ~ 2.54 cm during the negotiations , the offer is the same as it always was and there is absolutely no reason to believe it 's no longer there tomorrow . 
  any deadline was only set to put pressure on the greek government . 
  what do you want me to say ? 
  the offer ca n't be accepted because the eu wo n't renew it if greece would be willing to take it ? 
  ** this idea is insane ** . 
  you are here on the internet , you could have informed you about the issue for a very long time , from many different perspectives . 
  the reporting in germany ( and not only there ) is embarrassingly one-sided , sensational , biased and full of outright lies . 
  the probability of that happening is not higher than at any point in the past . 
  yes , everything is too late , the only thing left to do is wait for the apocalypse . 
  it 's just that you do n't have a good understanding of the situation . 
  `` yes '' would mean that syriza would accept the troika offer as is , `` no '' to reject it and look for a different solution , not more , not less . 
  i will repeat it once again : a refugee and an immigrant are something different . 
  just because there are many refugees in calais , for example , does n't make the immigrants , that maybe many of those people are not eligible for asylum does n't make them immigrants and that maybe many of them are lying about their place of origin and their reason for coming to europe does n't either . 
  hey europe , stop calling austria a `` tough guy '' !, 
  edit : typical european behavior . 
  is n't europe the place where hitler was from ? 
  figures . 
  oh , a greek-american is running a soup kitchen in athens -  america is saving greece !, 
  usa # 1 !, 
  this is even worse than the german stories about the greek . 
  the mental retardation in this sub is something staggering . 
  and just by the way , should anybody ever refer to a person as a representative of their country or even the country itself , in front of me in real life , as it happens here regularly , the swellings in their face and on my knuckles will take months to heal . 
  what difference does it make ? 
  they request asylum because their life is in danger somewhere , real or not , they are accommodated until the danger is over and then they 're sent back . 
  stop mixing up refugees and migrants , impossible to have a useful debate that way . 
  this referendum is not about leaving or staying in the eu . 
  unclear question ?
