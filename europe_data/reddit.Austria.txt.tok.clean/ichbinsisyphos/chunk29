  reads a bit like the british articles about france , not that i disagree with every word of it , though . 
   it will go something like this : if the members are willing to disband nato , yes . 
  if they want it to survive for another week , the mobilization has to start within half an hour of the first sighting of green men , should it really happen in a way that is surprising anyone . 
   i like how they 're almost preemptively blaming latvia for the upcoming invasion . 
  reading your post again , this is actually much more interesting . 
  so , do i get this right ? 
  they are calling for close cooperation of latvia with their nato partners and to be prepared for a possible invasion , and what you read into that is a blame ... nato is blaming latvia for provoking an invasion ? 
  yes ? 
  well , that 's not going to happen in significant numbers anyway , but it is thinkable to provide incentives in the form of grants or loans to start in the new home country . 
  giving isis money and virgins might make them less inclined to saw off people 's heads . 
  found a good explanation for that recently : http://np.reddit.com/r/de/comments/2wn7ub/xpost_sind_%c3%b6sterreicher_deutsche/coshuen  weil das oktoberfest das einzige bisschen `` kultur '' ist , dass \u00fcber deutsche landesgrenzen geschwappt ist . 
  the czechs are acting up lately . 
  remember kafkagate from a couple of days ago ? 
  now it 's mendelgate , they are producing scandal after scandal . 
  i am overwhelmed with joy . 
  try to find a map that does n't simply label austria with `` german '' or `` speak german '' or `` why is austria not part of germany '' . 
  excuse my ignorance , v4 means ** 4 ** times as much of a ** v ** ailure as the second most ridiculous multilateral organisation ? 
  omg , we 're not german !, 
  we 're not german , everyone !!!!!, 
  hey everybody , let 's make a dirndl but hide the tits !, 
  jesus christ , it 's like you feel into a barrel of american freedom juice as a child . 
  unless you 're hunting badgers . 
  uhum . 
  i do ' t know for sure , but i think austria is also faux-or-not-latin for east-something . 
  i dont want to bet on it , almost 40 % prefer him over anything else and he appeals to part of the sp\u00f6 and \u00f6vp base , griss votes will probably be split between van der bellen and hofer too . 
  theres a real good chance that he wins . 
  germany 's greatest accomplishment was to convince the world that beethoven had his productive period in germany and that hitler was the reichskanzler of austria . 
  i wonder why that happened , btw . 
  there used to be a time when the fp\u00d6 was systematically underestimated in polls , because nobody wanted to admit to voting for them , but not so much in the last ten years . 
   i know that people abroad perceive the whole v4 as one unified bloc i can assure you , i view it as not more than a slogan . 
  this dual-topic megathread idea worked out pretty well for the serbian topic . 
  the mainstream media does n't want you to know !, 
  what fut ? 
  you just said the greens are to the left of the sp\u00d6 ? 
  by which metric , imaginary or real , would this be possible ? 
  * left * being short for * not enough hardliner positions * ? 
  \u00d6vp occupies the center-right spot in the austrian political spectrum . 
  send someone to clean my monitor . 
  the numbers refer to the first , for those where there are two options . 
  example : * long term orientation vs. short term normative orientation ( lto ) * * germany : 83 * means germany is rather highly ( 83/100 ) long term orientated as defined in the descriptions . 
  and i 'd like to suggest you actually read the descriptions , intuition might not be good guide , especially for the points * masculinity * and * individualism * . 
  i do n't have any numbers , but i think that `` most of the top fp\u00d6 officials '' is a bit of stretch , the fp\u00d6 is just the only party in which you can propose such a thing at all . 
  in the same vain , i do n't think the fp\u00d6 shares a majority of views with the burschenschaften , they are just not treated as pariahs there like in any other party . 
  just think of how similar austrians are to bavarians and how it would be to have both outside of federal germany . 
  wow , jail time for face sitting , file sharing and listening to repetitive music . 
  you seem to know a lot about quantum computing , diamonds and the holes in them . 
  are you some kind of mad scientist ? 
  who are `` they '' ? 
  i still find it impossible that a lot of people believed leaving efta for the ec means joining a common market . 
  what would be the point of creating an eu/ec next to efta ? 
  the sausage ? 
  man , your the worst american ever , you ca n't even have a conversation about burgers hahahah . 
  how about fries ? 
  what 's your opinion on pommes frites ? 
  hey let 's change the topic ... which types of burger do you like ? 
  yeah , but `` first generation ** immigrant ** '' is not as ambiguous as just simply `` first generation '' . 
  the first generation you are referring to are not immigrants at all . 
  edit : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immigrant_generations#in_the_united_states hu ? 
  i find it hard to believe that `` first generation * immigrant * '' means born in the new country , anywhere . 
  `` first generation american '' or whatever , on the other hand would make sense . 
  of course i never experienced live before that point , but 3 days of civil war in 1934 between conservatives and socialists are often said to be the main reason for the consensus-addicted politics in austria ever since ... grand coalition between social democrats and conservatives , together supported by as close to 100 % of the population as possible , state owned companies split between them , ... 
  lobby your politicians to give more special deals to the uk , it would also help to start a petition with the goal to require merkel to officially state that brits are special , and pretty . 
  what if he does n't want to argue against germany ? 
  believe me , generating a synchronized 50hz harmonic signal across the grid is not going to be an unsolvable problem , should it ever actually emerge . 
  this was all before my time , but i know of one austrian show `` w\u00fcnsch dir was '' which used both methods around 1970 . 
  there were a couple of shows in the west where people voted by turning lights on or by flushing the toilet . 
  electricity or water consumption spikes would determine the outcome , it could be localized too to some extent . 
   there are christian popes ( ! ), 
  in certain countries ' parliaments what ? 
  this is why turks ca n't have nice things . 
  is his flair italian ? 
  fallschirm and flugzeug , weirds me out every time . 
  no , it does n't . 
  a british press thing , forget it . 
  poles forgot how to english again . 
  i do n't want to add more fuel to the fire , but i ca n't help but notice that his comment also insinuates that john paul ii was a wanker . 
  the comments in here should be used in school books about logical fallacies , well at least the first 30 or so , then i got tired of it . 
  unpeeled potates are ok if the skin is thin , but eating unpeeled wei\u00dfwurst is a lot like chewing on a condom . 
  what a piece of shit tabloid , jesus christ . 
  jesus christ are you annoying . 
  please go over your post in this thread and rethink your life . 
  well , he just wrote nato membership is a prerequisite , it definitely is not an official requirement , but it might be a good idea with countries that are susceptible to russian pressure . 
  in the irish referendum already , people voted against their own government . 
  what do you think will happen if the leave-vote wins . 
  cameron wo n't do it , he 'll resign and leave it to the next guy . 
  then there 's going to be the candidates that promise to ignore the referendum , leading to outrage on principle , in the end it could mean a prime minister farage , or some other the-world-must-burn type of guy . 
  it 's going to be a coin toss , no use to get worked up over it . 
   it 's just that some people call it after fuckin english language ( not various european ) term - manki - and that word has no any other meaning in croatian instead of that representing the character . 
  it also has no other root than the english `` monkey '' . 
  no , it is n't . 
  proof : austria , ireland , sweden and so on . 
  what a load of shit . 
  you have to imagine the common serbian guy passionately fighting for his political beliefs : `` hello my name is dragan petrovic and i believe the most pressing political topics in our time are high unemployment and not liking nato . 
  i expect my government to take the right steps to stimulate the job market , especially for young people just entering the job market , and express that they do n't like nato . '', 
  and that 's exactly why those less-and-worse-sex-groups must not be lumped together with feminists , not when they are trying to pass as feminists and not when they are n't , like here . 
  yes , you love the us for inventing pizza and you love empty gestures like waving flags , you also love calling out people for not following through the same meaningless motions . 
  why ? 
  because waving its flag is not the only way for you to show your love for your country , the next level of country love - the level you are on - is being perplexed by people who are not waving it . 
  do you want to know what your problem is ? 
  they thawed you ten years late , we went trough this bullshit with hundreds of thousands of other proud american patriots before you .
