   bbq is just one example of a truly american type of food . 
  what people do n't understand is that bbq is at low temperatures with smoke and grilling is at high temperatures with no smoke !, 
  i do n't even remember this discrimination point ever being made in the whole debate . 
  playing pirate because they are disenfranchised is not the same as doing it essentially as revenge for being discriminated against . 
  let 's not . 
  yes , post-9 / 11-us is the only healthy reaction to a terror attack .

  concepts of mass transport in reduced pressure are known from 200 years ago , with revivals in the 1920s and 70s . 
  we must stop reading the telegraph . 
  does anybody know why the other roman empires were less holy ? 
  omg another german plot to change history unveiled . 
  well , then start with the wiki article about mossadeqh . 
  because it 's only fun as long as there 's no consequences . 
  the governing parties in britain were always as pro-eu as necessary to keep the country in . 
  cameron is shitting his pants at the thought that he is going to be made responsible for the exit .

  i finally had some time to talk to a romanian coworker about romania recently . 
  when i asked him if he plans on moving back at one point , maybe when he 's retired , he looked at me with wide open eyes and told me he will never go back !, 
  living in post-communist romania is pretty much the worst form of torture he can imagine . 
  when he was younger only the `` gipsies '' where the thieves and crooks , then all people where . 
  living in communism had its downsides , but afterwards the mafia took over , corruption everywhere , you could get away with anything if you had cash to bribe the cops and/or knew thew right people . 
  and if you did n't have the wealth , all that was left for you was to work like a mule all day just to feed yourself . 
  he follows the anti-corruption efforts but is sure it will take another 20 years before romania is `` a normal country '' , too little and too late for him to consider moving back . 
  after every family visit on christmas each year he comes back to austria even more convinced . 
  funny , because working all day like a mule to feed myself is exactly what my job here feels like , but for him it is heaven on earth . 
   there are like 2.5 m ppl in greek part of macedonia isnt those macedonians as well ? 
  no , they are from the current greek region of macedonia , cgrm . 
  you fotrogians are so generous . 
  oh please tell me more how you and your fellow countrymen do n't care about the name . 
  the most common surname in slovakia is the hungarian word for `` croat '' ? 
  fred phelps has never been secretary of defence . 
  you americans will never understand just how diverse europe is , there 's much more difference between , say , bruck an der mur and leoben than between american cities like new york and los angeles . 
  in the us everybody speaks american english and eats the same kind of burger , while leoben for example even has its own unique version of the steireranzug , totally different to the steireranzug commonly found in bruck an der mur , or other places in europe .

  this bank is a walking corpse since 2009 , unrelated to any developments anywhere else . 
  live the eu , live the dream !, 
   but i doubt they 'd have to raise taxes more than a few percent haha , i see you are new to the topic . 
  i just googled , carinthia 's total income in 2016 is $ 2.2 billion , hypo alpe adria means a liability of around 10 to 11 billion euros . 
  well , if carinthia is bankrupt , nobody get 's anything , so ... edit : you know , the `` province '' talked about here is the state of carinthia and the federal government obviously did n't have the means to stop them giving the guarantee . 
  and when i said that it 's `` suddenly the problem of the federal government '' i meant that at the point of bankruptcy , caranthia is out of options and the federal goverment can try to keep things afloat somehow . 
  that the rest of austria just pays a $ 10billion bill for carinthia is not going to happen . 
  the reason why this is even a topic is because this whole thing is threatening to drive carinthia into bankruptcy and then it 's suddenly the problem of the federal government , which did n't give any guarantees to anyone . 
  well , measuring your penises sure would n't be worth it . 
  your mum is a lie . 
  take a look at the comments on david cameron 's facebook page , if you ca n't take youtube comments . 
  it 's like a best-of of recent media lies and misrepresentations , plus revenge on greece and lots and lots of whining . 
  yes . 
  i for one downvote trash posts . 
  the milk is too damn cheap ? 
  for which job can you expect $ 1100 net , though . 
  you know , i have a lot of slovenian colleagues and if you can earn that much in slovenia , the commuting expenses , the hassle of spending multiple hours in the car every day and considering that they have to pay taxes in slovenia too ... it does n't really look like it 's worth it . 
  i would 've bet the average income in slovenia is between 700 and 800 euros . 
  edit : no , it 's around $ 1100 . 
  too lazy to look it up now , but is n't slovenia 's minimum wage here higher than the average wage ? 
  lol, 
  as a serb i 'd also say kosovo . 
  and bosnia ... the land without the people . 
  op sounds a little trollish , but i might be wrong . 
   david cameron 's [ facebook ] page . 
  hahaha , nice one . 
  yeah , somebody said ... and there 's going to be an official denial by tomorrow ... 
  * - * gesprungen wie gegangen * , ** jumped as walked ** , when the result is the same no matter how you get there .

  in finland it is so ridiculously obvious what 's going on . 
  the government insisted on continuing their way , it failed and now the euro is to blame . 
  shut up , buddies . 
  there 's a * article in one page * link on the bottom of the page , does n't make the article shorter , though . 
   they are the one who got the largest number of suffrage ( 6,000,000 people ) . 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  no , sometimes they are called by their first name and the first letter of their family name . 
  names of suspects are not to be published until they are found guilty , for reasons that are obvious , i guess . 
  i am trying to imagine how relieved / u/onkko must feel now that you 've finally apologized for not completing his nuclear power plant . 
  and you do n't see how the eu is related to all that ? 
  wwii was fundamentally a war over strategic resources and land . 
  yes , i believe war in europe ended with the eu and its predecessors . 
  spoken like a true british patriot . 
  eu needs `` reform '' and the reason is junker . 
  yeah , nice . 
  i usually like these short '' < things  of < european country  '' chains , but this one is really , really low effort shit . 
  1 . daughters in the anthem . 
  2 . economy sucks . 
  3 . job market sucks . 
  how does this work ? 
  ikea and harvard are accused of buying wood from romanian companies , wood that those companies were n't allowed to sell ? 
  how does the blame end at the buyers side ? 
  sounds extremely plausible . 
  and you earn 10 times as much ... 
  you know the bosnians never had a problem with living in bosnia , the problems all came from the surrounding nations that wanted their `` rightful '' piece of it . 
  this was the result of wwi , the habsburgs did n't rule serbia . 
  gavrilo was strictly speaking also not a serb , but a bosnian serb .
