  greece or spain for the weather . 
  lol ? 
  i did n't notice that . 
  i got mostly the monarchs , the prime minister and the irish oak wrong . 
  also all language questions , if i remember correctly . 
  but first i accidentally clicked lithuania instead of latvia in the country shape part . 
  you know , you believe you are having a political discussion , because in the british echo chamber those are presented as completely valid arguments that make tons of sense . 
  it 's not that people do n't agree with your opinion , they are just annoyed by this nonsensical bullshit that never ever seems to stop . 
  what would you say to a welsh guy that goes on about the democratic deficit in the uk , because the secretary of state for transport is n't elected in a popular vote , `` who is this guy , i never voted for him , he was chosen by a shadowy process behind closed doors . 
  it 's far from being democratic '' . 
  at first you might try to explain to him how the world works , but if he keeps going on all that you can do is to tell him `` hey shithead , go fuck a sheep ! '', 
  and the brits , you see , are the eu 's sheep shaggers . 
  ze democratic deficit , powers only ever going to brussels and never back , no more pints and inches , i did n't vote for junckers , you know * gestures wildly *, 
  europe warns the us of an increased chance of a terror attack during next super bowl . 
  you might have noticed that i did n't respond to your post , but the one from the guy aiming for the / r/shitamericanssay hall of fame . 
  we could thank him for his service , hundreds of times , like a bunch of retarded parrots . 
  hey let 's have a `` american that fought in wwii '' ama in / r/europe . 
  but you trust your understanding of german enough to post this bullshit in your op above ? 
  yes of course , i did n't think of it , but they are of course watched , and individually identified , around the clock out of scientific interest . 
  yes , exactly ... 
  i mean no . 
  sorry what is the question ? 
  i do n't know how it is in poland in general or in this forest in particular , but hunters in austria kept tab on the animals in their territory . 
  it must be because you 're an auslander !!!!, 
  you should really try to avoid jumping to the xenophobia explanation at the first chance , what about austrians that have their cars searched or get a parking ticket ? 
  is it because i am austrian !, 
  oh , wait , that argument already exists ... 
  while i find it possible that a romanian license plate had something to do with why your car was searched - maybe they were looking for a romanian car in the surroundings of the airport - it is near impossible that your car was towed because of it and ... the vignette is to be place one the left side or center behind the rear view mirror , else you 're fined , romanian or not . 
  this is not an attempt to keep this retarded `` conversation '' going , but you really need to rethink your definitions of `` left '' and `` right '' . 
  the social democrats are to the left of the greens , and those already abandoned the majority of classical social democrat demands . 
  no that is not what i am saying my little friend , i am saying that the fp\u00d6 is on the right end of the spectrum of austrian politics and the greens are in the center . 
  you are the one who can handle nuances : everything is either moderate or equally extremist , which is a ridiculous shit argument , no matter how often you hear it . 
  wanting to destroy democracy is not a requirement to be on the right end of the political spectrum in any given country , actually , why are you counting wanting to abolish democracy to the right ? 
  by which logic again ? 
  surely not judging by their politics , that much i do know . 
  yes , and that 's pretty much where the austrian greens are . 
  and anybody between stalin and hitler is a moderate ? 
  and why is that ? 
  i mean , buddy , what do you think is to the right of the fp\u00d6 in austrian politics ? 
  anything ? 
  and there is a whole world to the left of the greens , you know all the left politics . 
  burning wood and other plant material and arguably also processed products from it like paper , etc. 
  are a renewable energy source , as it grows back and a rotting tree releases just as much co2 as one that is burned . 
  `` the countries '' are n't pushing for it , it 's certain extremist factions inside them that do . 
  oh , believe it or not , but i did n't see it without the hint . 
  telegraph ... juncker caught eating british baby , france spills wine again , oh , and its economy collapses ... for real !, 
  refugees arent really that big of a topic in austria , believe it or not . 
  fences or not , i dont know a single person that thinks of it as a pressing problem . 
  the fp\u00d6 is the only that has a chance against the ruling grand coalition . 
  what of this really happens on the eu level ? 
  what i 've found out so far is that the uk introduces plain packaging and warning images tomorrow . 
  your post is shit , buddy , do you understand what i am saying ? 
  the eu does n't allow you to disagree with my opinion . 
  oh , and i was n't only talking about yours , almost all replies in this submission are low-effort shitposts , at least they were when i read it . 
  it makes several points actually and none of them are valid in any way . 
  btw , is it me , or is the shitpost ratio in here dangerously close to 100 % again ? 
  til i tiled . 
  til i learned all gays like to shitpost . 
  we need a eurovision porn parody . 
  now !, 
  i 've got three words for you : eurovision broadcasting union . 
  since electromagnetic waves did n't care about borders or the sea or tectonic plates it was never restricted to europe . 
  you know what ? 
  the countries on the northern coast of africa are also in it . 
  telegraph . 
  of course they are able to produce according to standard , but it 's always a trade off with engine power . 
  maybe they thought they get a little edge over the competition by cheating ... or the competition has n't been tested thoroughly enough . 
  britain brexiting or not has nothing to do with it . 
  the uk has no control over the english spoken elsewhere . 
  that 's not how you eurovision , try again . 
  the songs are nothing special , maybe around 3 of them will be played on the radio for a while . 
  watch it live , with many other people ( or online ) , alcohol helps too . 
  did you make a screenshot ? 
  well , it 's not a bad song , but it was n't in my top 3 either . 
  yes . 
  you know , so far i would vote for australia and if i did n't for yuropean reasons i would go with spain , none of the others stood out . 
  damn , i missed australia , how was it live ? 
  the netherlands is going to rename itself to the nashville . 
  what walter ? 
  lol, 
  swiss german has its own standardization organizations , so i would say it 's exactly as much its own language as croatian/serbian/bosnian , the `` multilingual '' warning labels and other stuff are just the representatives of those groups being as much of a dick as humanly possible . 
  why are they talking about a `` iwanow '' instead of a `` khmelevsky '' ? 
  because of the very reasons you see at work here : the danger that the negotiation is derailed by mob outrage . 
  wow , the uk is fucking advanced !, 
  alphabetically sorted from north to south , that 's really basic yuropean knowledge . 
  it is called that in the context of the naming contest , why would it be called boaty mcboatface when an article is actually about some research it conducts ? 
  juncker will force you to hand it over for free , just wait and see . 
  damn , we lost another one , guys . 
  new strategy : schulz and juncker do n't talk to the press until the referendum is over and bring out the pope , have him say how much cuter the uk looks inside the eu !, 
  ahh , the good old telegraph . 
  why do n't you talk to greece yourself ? 
  all of the netherlands is at 0 ( + / -2 m ) above sea level . 
  there 's a german conspiracy theory , a quite popular one too , that germany is still occupied territory , never got a peace treaty after wwii , ... germans are not without a nation , they are stateless in the sense that germany is not a sovereign state . 
  the insane annual tribute is for what , my friend ? 
  die you translate `` deutschland ist kein staat '' to `` germany is without a nation '' ? 
  lol .
