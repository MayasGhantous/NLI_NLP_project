in austria two 14 year old teenager can have sex , but not a 18 year old with a 14 year old !, 
  but media in austria say , some of the judges ( 6 of 13 ! ), 
  had definitely a problem with this decision . 
  they issued a warning , after the decision . 
  yes , we austrians ... 
  the press in turkey is so much better . 
  it was no advert , it was a news screen . 
  and the headline was : `` turkey allows sex with children under 15 years . '', 
  no more , no less . 
  it was a court decision in your country . 
  the austrian press is free an critical . 
  they would write the same about austria if we had such a law . 
  newspapers in many european countries had the same headline on that day . 
  would be a good way to speed up brexit , 
  have you ever seen german dubs ? 
  they are probably the best in the world . 
  i 'm right there with you but an average german speaker do n't have the skills to understand english series or films . 
  and they do n't want to improve it . 
  many people over 50 do n't speak a single word . 
  my parents did n't learn english at school . 
  and to be honest , sometimes i want to understand 100 % of a film , relax and think about nothing . 
  this is the moment when i turn on rtl and watch csi : miami in german language ( btw . 
  with better sayings than in the original version ) , 
  of course , original sound is always better . 
  but the german synchronization is one of the best in the world , and most people do n't have a problem with it . 
  many people from eastern european countries want to work in a german speaking country . 
  and when you want to live here you definitely need german language skills . 
  germany is the 4th largest national economy in the world . 
  so in europe it 's not the worst decision to learn german . 
  btw . 
  we do n't have subtitled american films . 
  all films are synchronized in a very good quality . 
  and sometimes there are also good films made in germany or austria , 
  the thing is you need english when you want to talk with people from other european countries . 
  ( especially in tourism and in international companies with different sub-offices ) and it 's more important in smaller language areas . 
  you can get nearly every cultural product translated in german language ( because german has almost 100 mio . 
  speakers ) . 
  same situation in spain , france or italy . 
  but in countries like sweden or hungary you will have problems to get all what you want in your language . 
  yes , that 's true . 
  but the ( emotional ) main topics will be refugees from the middle east and european border controls . 
  good question , but i do n't think so . 
  the federal president is not responsible for such laws . 
  nevertheless , in an election campaign everything is possible . 
  ** austria ** this week turkey was an important topic in austrian politics . 
  ** monday ** sunday night heavy thunderstorms caused flooding in 3 states . 
  in styria 106 fire services ( 1,250 firefighters ) were in action .

  later 19 turkish associations gave a common press conference in vienna to announce that they defend erdo\u011fan . 
  the conservative peoples party ( \u00d6vp ) and the far-right freedom party ( fp\u00d6 ) do n't want that . 
  the social democrats ( sp\u00d6 ) said , we follow the geneva convention on refugees , and each individual case will be reviewed ( what means we do n't need new regulations or laws for turkish people ) . 
  [ source ( de ) ] ( http://orf.at/stories/2352409/2352408/ ) ** thursday ** austrian authorities received terror threats for police stations and public buildings in vienna , lower austria and styria .

  very interesting . 
  but is it really necessary to offer every book and magazine with free shipping ? 
  ( everyone is able to download it as pdf ) what i want to say is : it 's very expensive to create such multi-lingual material ( there are even magazines and comics in this shop ) . 
  the people who want a printed copy should pay for it ( except schools ) . 
  we need our taxes for more important projects . 
  unfortunately eu skeptics wo n't order these books . 
   why is electricity so freaking expensive though ? 
  where are you from ? 
  here in austria electricity is not very expensive . 
  the prices fall every year . 
  i do n't know but austrians usually put eggs in the fridge . 
  in my local supermarket eggs are in the refrigerator . 
   also shitloads of tourists in vienna not only vienna . 
  in the summertime ( so at the moment ) salzburg is full of japanese tourists . 
  yesterday i was in a crowded supermarket in the main station of salzburg , and there were only japanese people :d, 
  austria will do the same . 
  it 's the same name with a different spelling . 
  not really . 
  austria always had very good relations with russia . 
  some russians even think that austria is an ally of russia inside the eu , but that 's not true . 
  we just think , that sanctions are not the best way , to solve problems . 
  in an alpine village . 
  they have long winters and not very warm summers . 
  sounds horrible to me . 
  salzburg has only 150.000 inhabitants but you do n't really need a car here . 
  you can reach almost every place in the city with trolley busses . 
  in the inner city you can get a bus every few minutes . 
  and there 's a network of suburban train lines ( called s-bahn ) . 
  in austria you can find railway lines even in very rural areas . 
  because this is not profitable , each austrian state pays for it . 
  some states pay more and some less . 
  so we have differences between the 9 states . 
  with public busses ( `` postbus '' ) you can reach almost every municipality in austria . 
  our high speed train is called `` railjet '' and connects some of the biggest cities in austria .
