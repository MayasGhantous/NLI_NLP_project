  users in austria ) were enormously popular in the early 2000s . 
  another very successful network was szene1.at . 
  ( sms.at and szene1.at still exists ), 
  in the usa you have to pay when you take an incoming call . 
  same here in austria . 
   sch\u00f6ller ( nestle ) sch\u00f6ller is often available in restaurants , bistros and caf\u00e9s . 
   haagen-dasz where can you buy it in austria ? 
  i 've never seen it in any `` normal '' austrian supermarket . 
   also , is ben & jerry 's a well known brand where you live ? 
  not really here in austria . 
  `` eskimo '' is king . 
  it 's sold everywhere . 
  especially popsicles are very popular . 
  `` eskimo '' is the unilever brand which has another name in every country ( langnese in germany , miko in france , wall 's in britain ... ) it 's the brand with the red hearth . 
  some of the most popular popsicles are only available in austria .

  because germany has the strongest economy in the eu and it has more inhabitants . 
  cars with automatic transmission . 
  in europe most cars have a stick . 
  if you want an automatic car you have to pay an extra charge . 
   no end in sight to it , either . 
  they have the au ( african union ) . 
  this is a good start . 
  smartphone plans and internet plans are very cheap in austria . 
  you can get an unlimited lte plan vor $ 19 a month . 
  i use it for netflix and youtube and it works fine . 
  we did have some small colonies . 
  tianjin from 1901 to 1917 . https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_colonial_policy, 
   is there anything else like this in austria ? 
  it 's not comparable with seestadt aspern , but there is a completely new area in the district of lehen in salzburg . 
  it 's called the `` stadtwerk lehen '' . 
  it 's actually two areas ( called `` stadtwerkeareal '' and `` strubergasse '' ) , but they are connected . 
  ( strubergasse is under construction , the other one was finished in 2011 ) -  [ map ] ( http://imgl.krone.at/bilder/2015/08/22/ein-stadtteil-als-baustelle-lehen-zieht-um-story-468468_630x356px_4441fccca95e41b7571a85492428b5d8__lehn_jpg.jpg ) [ here ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/category:inge-morath-platz,_salzburg ) are some images of the inge-morath-platz , inside the stadtwerke areal . 
  and [ here ] ( https://www.stadt-salzburg.at/internet/wirtschaft_umwelt/stadtplanung/stadtteilentwicklung_444375/stadtteil_lehen_444403/stadtwerk_lehen_450141.htm ) are more information about the project ( in german ) . 
  it 's one of the biggest projects of its kind in europe . 
  many austrians do n't even know anything about the austrian civil war . 
  haha , the classroom language in my english class at htl was german most of the time !, 
  the english skills of some students were better than those of our teacher . 
  our english teacher gave us the choice . 
  we learnt vocabulary for ae and be . 
  everyone chose american english . 
  i can understand written dutch because there are many similarities to german . 
  but i ca n't understand spoken dutch . 
  inn4tler = innviertler ( because 4 = vier ) means i 'm from innviertel ( i 'm an innviertler ) . 
  innviertel is a region in upper austria and one of its four quarters . 
  ( inn = the river inn ; viertel = quarter ), 
  i think the main problem in your country is not to have all power lines overhead . 
  the problem is the quality of your line masts and transformers . 
  here in austria rual areas often have overhead lines . 
  but there 's almost no difference to a city with underground lines . 
  the last power failure was several years ago , and only for few seconds or minutes . 
  [ usa ] ( http://www.bernd-weiss.de/pics/stromkasten.jpg ) vs. [ europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/maststation_imgp7806.jpg/800px-maststation_imgp7806.jpg ), 
  that 's an old cliche from the 1970s . 
  nowadays linz is a very modern and beautiful city . 
  this may be the official standard but $ 2,50 and eur 2,50 is also very common . 
  have you never seen this ? 
  it 's a standard in many countries . 
  the usa . 
  ok , then it was fake news , 
  i heard in the news that we are the only country in europe where it 's free . 
  in germany it 's pretty expensive to withdraw money at an atm of a bank where you do n't have a bank account . 
  withdrawing money from every atm without paying any fees . 
  it does n't matter which bank . 
  here in austria each bank card has a built-in nfc chip . 
  more and more people use this way to pay small amounts under $ 25 . 
  but i have never seen anyone paying with a smartphone . 
  and amazon.de is available in english language : https://www.amazon.de/?language=en_gb, 
  klimt - the kiss https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_kiss_ ( klimt ), 
  graz is the second largest city in austria . 
  so it would make sense to choose it . 
  but i would choose linz . 
  it 's the capital of a state with a very strong economy and there is a good infrastructure to the rest of the country ( high speed trains and autobahn to vienna ) . 
  and the most important point : people are very friendly . 
  it would be a good capital for austria . 
  lol , i hope that 's a joke :d https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/czechoslovakia, 
  i do n't know . 
  the thing is , the united states are huge . 
  if the usa were part of the eu , 39 % of all eu citizens would be americans . 
  your country would be the boss in the eu . 
  and there are so many different ( social ) standards and laws between the eu and the usa . 
  it would be a really ambitious project :d, 
  canada , australia and new zealand would be ok for me . 
  they have european standards . 
  here in austria the orf ( austrian broadcasting cooperation ) is our national broadcaster . 
  we have * orfeins - for a younger audience ( hollywood , series , sitcoms , sports , children ) * orf 2 - for an older audience ( news , infotainment , local information , austrian and german movies and series , telenovelas , volksmusik ) , orf2 is available in 9 versions . 
  one for every state . 
  * orf iii - high quality programme ( documentaries , health , politics , art house , history ) * orfsport + - minority sports we have to pay 25 euros per month . 
  that 's way too much for a programme which is full of commercials . 
  in my opinion we only need orf iii and a news channel . 
  here in central europe we have radio clocks . 
  so it 's not a big thing . 
  so true !, 
  i love the long summer evenings . 
  we could make the summer time to our normal time . 
  willhaben.at is one of the most visited websites in austria . 
  you can sell all your stuff there . 
  that 's interesting . 
  eurosport germany is free to air . 
  ( eurosport 2 is pay tv ), 
  but it 's not an english song .
