  musical : i guess `` sound of music '' . 
  american tourists love it . 
  ( i 've never seen it ) song : i 'd say `` live is life '' by opus : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egikhmjtszi, 
  sachertorte ( it 's the best chocolate cake you can get in austria ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sachertorte, 
  when you want to live in a big european city come to vienna . 
  it 's the city with the best life quality in the world . 
  https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/23/vienna-named-worlds-top-city-for-quality-of-life berlin would also be a good choice . 
  it 's a very young and modern city . 
  a few years ago i heard in the radio that it 's illegal to walk slowly on a sidewalk . 
  they said it 's a law from the austrian empire and still existing . 
  it 's a bit more complicated . 
  for people from northern germany dutch sounds more familiar than swiss german . 
  they have big problems to understand it . 
  but people from western austria do understand swiss people . 
  in my opinion every ( strong ) german dialect is actually a language of its own . 
  ( like the languages in scandinavia ) there are even differences in grammar . 
  if swiss german had a written standard , most people would say `` yes , that 's another ( similar ) language '' . 
  the problem ist there is no definition what a ` language ' is exactly . 
  btw . 
  wikipedia has official versions for different german dialects . 
  looks very funny for german speakers :d, 
  luxemburghish is actually a german dialect ( called moselfr\u00e4nkisch ) . 
  it 's also spoken in some parts of germay as a dialect . 
  i 'm from austria and can understand almost every single word ( for me it 's like swiss german ) . 
  the main difference to germany or austria is , that they do n't use standard german for writing and in the media . 
  so it is officially a language of its own . 
   our biggest cities are n't that big ( except london , paris , madrid and rome maybe ) do n't forget berlin . 
  3.5 mio people live there . 
  it 's the second largest city in the eu . 
   never had that problem that 's interesting . 
  here it 's very common to send videos or photos in whatsapp groups . 
  today my parents were in a furniture shop and they sent me photos of furniture that i might like . 
  they have both no facebook account . 
  it 's really convenient . 
  you can reach almost everyone in austria with whatsapp , you only need the phone number . 
  ( mms would n't be an alternative , because it 's very expensive . 
  i 've never used mms in my life . ), 
  austria is a small country , so it 's not easy for a filmmaker . 
  most movies for cinema are sponsored by the orf ( our national public service broadcaster ) and other national/public offices . 
  the quality of these movies is usually very high and it 's often nominated for international film festivals . 
  here is a list with austrian movies : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_austrian_films_of_the_2010s movies for television are usually produced in cooperation with a german television network . 
  the target audience is `` older '' (  40 ) and the movies are set in idealized regional settings ( like a village in the mountains ) . 
  sponsoring is very important for the austrian movie industry . 
  how do you send videos or photos to people who do n't have facebook ? 
  here in austria more people have whatsapp than facebook . 
  most people say `` amerika '' . 
  in the news `` usa '' ist used most of the time . 
  the gulf stream is not as important for europe as people think . 
  it 's only a good story for tabloids . 
  austria has 8.7 million people at the moment . 
  so you can round to 9 million , 
  honestly i did n't know that . 
  when you go to orf.at ( austrias biggest news site ) you ca n't find anything about your election . 
  ( actually i 'm interested in policits . 
  so i 'm a bit surprised now ), 
  never ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  but it 's very , very common in austria : http://derstandard.at/2000048461411/der-praesident-im-klassenzimmer, 
  schools in austria do n't have flags . 
  there 's a picture of the federal president and the coat of arms of austria in every classroom . 
  but there are no eu symbols . 
  christoph waltz explained it in 2013 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r61ecyegbm , 
  in austria it 's illegal to bear an aristocratic name . 
  actually most people say m\u00e4ci . 
  are you from austria ? 
  here most people say m\u00e4ci . 
  in english : `` no matter how good you can drive . 
  trains transport goods . '', 
  german speakers can understand a second meaning : `` no matter how good you can drive . 
  trains * drives * better . '', 
  ( we use the word `` drive '' for trains too ) here the explanation : * the german comparative of `` gut '' ( good ) is actually `` besser '' ( better ) * in this case , `` g\u00fcter '' is used instead of `` besser '' . 
  it 's a wrong comparative of `` gut '' . 
  like `` gooder '' in english . 
  * and this makes the sentence funny : `` g\u00fcter '' is the german word for `` goods '' . 
  so the sentence has two meanings , but only the version with the wrong comparative of `` good '' makes sense . 
  it 's hard to explain , but the sentence sounds funny :d, 
  it 's very common in online shops . 
  it 's faster and easier with trains . 
  ice , tgv , raijet , pendolino ... there are many high speed trains in europe . 
  there 's even a train connection between uk and france . 
  3sat is a cooperative network owned by the public broadcasters of germany , switzerland and austria ( the `` 3 '' in 3sat is for the 3 different countries ) . 
   [ ... ] and the public broadcaster from switzerland ( srf ) only in cable networks . 
  60 % of all austrians receive television via astra satellite . 
  for srf you need another dish position and a swiss smart card ( only available for swiss citizens ) . 
  unfortunately there 's no chance to watch swiss television for most austrians . 
  you forgot the private radio stations . 
  in some states they are pretty successful . 
  ( e.g. 
  ( made for a young and urban target group ) most radio stations are similar to \u00d63 . 
  that 's the reason why radio is a bit boring in austria . 
  always the same music and radio hosts without creative freedom ( bbc radio is so much better and more spontaneous . 
  i listen it often via internet . ), 
  last but not least newspapers : more and more people read free daily newspapers . 
  you can get it in metro or bus stations . 
  these newspapers are really sh *** y. 
  typical tabloids with big pictures and naked women . 
  people love that ... 
  wow , i thought liquors are at 18 in every state . 
  til . 
  there is a word in the austrian german language which is called `` heuer '' .
