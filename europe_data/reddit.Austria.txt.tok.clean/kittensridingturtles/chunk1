i 'm sure they have sex when german forester is around ... 
  do n't get me wrong - i think that it 'd make more sense to count estonia to northern europe ( a bit torn on latvia , somewhat skeptical about lithuania - though here i 'm too little informed , need to spend more time there ) . 
  also , main purpose of that classification does seem to be the security council . 
  where estonia competes for a non-permanent seat with romania . 
  this whole thing does remind me of this excellent fp article , a bit offtopic but definitely applicable : http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/22/the-unlearned-lessons-from-the-collapse-of-the-soviet-union, 
  estonia counts , for the un , to eastern europe . 
  at the beginning of 2017 there was some news about it being `` reclassified '' to northern europe ( which it is counted to for various statistics ) . 
  however , for all intents and purposes , it 's still eastern europe .

  are elections close ? 
  we do n't know . 
  probably , though , seeing how things have gone from worse to bottom of the septic tank in our political discourse recently . 
  10 year celebration of [ web war 1 ] ( https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/web-war-cyberattack-russia-estonia/ ) ? 
  to me it feels like all parties are in election mode since at least the presidential election anyway . 
  also , this was the 4th ( ? ), 
  coup within the \u00d6vp in the last 10 years . 
  got to love austrian politics . 
  disgustingly sunny and warm ( 26 \u00b0 c ) . 
  luckily , the office has a ( surprisingly ) working ac unit . 
  ` tis the season when one avoids the climate ... 
  yes , we do n't do 1 - 300 ghz here . 
  we do radio , then directly to infrared . 
  anecdote here : once i went to eat out with acquaintances in the us . 
  when finished , they immediately wanted to pay and asked what we 'd do next . 
  which seemed strange to me , because when i go for a meal here with friends or acquaintances , we usually eat , have at least another drink , and stay a while to talk and simply enjoy each others company . 
  for example , i spent 3 hours at a sushi place yesterday with a friend . 
  the way of eating i experienced in the us seemed so ... hectic , i 'd say . 
  well , yes , that 's basically what i meant . 
  sorry for the confusion . 
  paradox games . 
  every official and public infrastructure in ( at least ) vienna ( and i think everywhere in austria ) has to be usable by every person . 
  that means that you may use every public transportation service without help ( in case of buses and some older trams with the help of the driver ) while being in a wheelchair . 
  generally , though grumpy and pissed off as we may be , people will also ( ask to ) assist you and your girlfriend should you struggle . 
  also , every train platform , for example , is reachable by an elevator . 
  some cobbled streets may be uncomfortable for you , but i have no actual idea how it is to be wheelchair-bound , sorry for my ignorance . 
  here , a handy guide : [ accesible vienna ] ( https://www.wien.info/en/travel-info/accessible-vienna ) do feel free to pm me if you need any help or have any questions . 
  estonians seem to be so happy that they can be part of an international organization without being forced to be in that . 
  i get it , considering how things were up until 1991 . 
  that 's at least the vibe i get from them . 
  for the [ un statistics ] ( http://data.un.org/countryprofile.aspx?crname=estonia ) , estonia is northern europe . 
  [ regionally ] ( http://www.un.org/depts/dgacm/regionalgroups.shtml ) , it is still considered to be eastern europe by the un . 
  sorry if this came across wrong : i am concerned with the current state of immigration , and the hysterical tones with which it is discussed in the public in the past 2 years . 
  that does n't mean i 'm concerned by all immigration . 
  again , sorry that that came out wrong . 
  i have yet to get to know an austrian who is n't generally annoyed to people ( not only from the us , but generally ) thinking that the depiction in [ the sound of music ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/?ref_=nv_sr_1 ) is ... accurate . 
  or anything . 
  apart from that , austria is , i think , pretty much a blind spot , except for christoph waltz , arnold schwarzenegger , and adolf hitler . 
  i. . . i always thought it was `` pardon my french . '' . 
  and that people were self-aware of the irony . 
  and all that . 
  anyway . 
  i do n't think we have something like that in german . 
  regarding baltics , be sure to read up on [ web war i ] ( https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/web-war-cyberattack-russia-estonia/ ) . 
  pertaining to your question : i have to say spain and portugal . 
  i mean , i had a general idea , but since it was n't really an area of interest to me ( due to the climate ) i never really cared that much . 
  this sub made sure i went to madrid , barcelona , and lisboa last year . 
  still not a fan of the climate , but at least a bit less ignorant now . 
  seeing that , historically , most of european culture seems to revolve around waging war with each other and destroying the continent ( [ hell , there 's places where you ca n't go nearly 100 years after world war i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zone_rouge ) ) , i 'm not too concerned by the immigration of new people . 
  that being said , i do wish that the policy for immigration was a bit more ... organized . 
  edit : formatting . 
  vienna : i 'd have to say yes , probably . 
  i mean , i work in a law office , and our go-to language is english ( when talking business ; shittalking is mostly done in german , though i do n't have a lot to do with our more international teams where they always talk english ) . 
  in a medical center ? 
  not necessaily directly with the patient , but i do n't think anybody at the [ akh ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna_general_hospital ) really gives a shit if somebody in some internal function only speaks english . 
  austria : if possible , try to get a hike into the alps . 
  i can highly recommend the [ hochschwab ] ( http://www.summitpost.org/hochschwab/151652 ) - it 's not too challenging and if you stick to the paths you 'll be just fine . 
  stick to the paths . 
  though , if both of you have no alpine experience whatsoever , please familiarize yourself a bit with how to behave on a mountain , and what to take with you . 
  vienna : first district , central cemetary , sch\u00f6nbrunn . 
  some museums that interest you . 
  if you visit here , and are interested , hit me up and i 'll show you around . 
  i 've been to auschwitz 2 times , once with the `` march of rememberance and hope '' and `` march of the living '' , and the other time with acquaintances from university last year . 
  i 'd highly recommend planning on not being okay for at least one day . 
  also , do n't take pictures . 
  do n't put a camera lense between you and what you 'll see there . 
  estonia . 
  prefer the climate there . 
  had one in hand on ... monday ? 
  do n't see what the fuzz is all about . 
  a friend of mine - teacher for secondary school - told me he has n't seen any kids with it . 
  so ... at least in my environment , nobody has or uses them , or knows anybody who has or uses one . 
  thank you !, 
  i honestly thought it was just the go-to name for that . 
  shows my ignorance . 
  the one i 'm at any given point of time and do n't have to pay for my beer . 
  if the plans are like anything my friend from estonia had while she was here in vienna last semester on erasmus ( special erasmus plan ) , i 'd say you got off pretty good . 
  how long do you plan on staying ? 
  what are you interested in ? 
  if it 's in the summer , i 'd politely suggest you staying for at least two months and just get an [ interrail ticket ] ( http://www.interrail.eu/ ) . 
  you 'll meet so many people on the trains , you 'll see a lot of landscape , you can just up and go whenever you want to basically . 
  how dare you address his god-sent graciousness , gargamel of radlbrunn , as `` uncle '' ? 
  uk version is a short series ( 4 episodes ) , and sir ian richardson really brings a modern version of shakespeare 's richard iii to life . 
  if interested , you may watch it on youtube . 
  personally , i prefer the british original . 
  it 's a contained story , and sir ian richardson is just amazing . 
  [ koralm tunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koralm_tunnel ) . 
  to quote a professor of mine : `` best example for what sunk costs are . 
  probably would be cheaper to just detonate that damn mountain . '', 
  i want to agree with that ( smug viennese that i am ) , but having opec , un , and eu headquarters here - not to mention all the other international organizations , plus all the congresses - would be a bit unfair , i feel . 
  also : what it would do to rent .
