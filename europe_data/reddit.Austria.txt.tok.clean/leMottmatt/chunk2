  you 've got this the wrong way round . 
  ikr everyone knows that south tyrol is in austria . 
  you lose your shit if people call the cyrillic alphabet russian . 
  yes but , but , but technically correct is the best correct . 
  technically seen it 's a ds which is the new premium brand of the psa corporation . 
  i said relatively fast though . 
  not the fastest . 
  i looked it up and appearantly it 's russia , poland and ukraine . 
  it 's losing population relatively fast . 
  other indo-european languages like latin , greek , slavic languages and italian as well as non indo-european languages like turkish . 
  also there 's words from a mysterious unidentified language that also influenced romanian and other languages of the balkans . 
  it has the indo european language with the least amount of words from pie surviving . 
  tyrol one piece : 11/10 edit : i suddenly see that salzburg is part of this and i question if it 's truly worth it . 
  stop making me cry . 
  can you read german ? 
  i could give you some literature about that from university . 
  it looks like my grandparent 's house . 
  keeping them there just in case they 're getting back to use .

  for me every country has its own beauty so there 's no best and no worst . 
  ^ except belgium , because a country can only ever be so boring , 
  house shoes glorious house shoes . 
  salzburg is pretty rich . 
  maybe due to it being a major hub for german companies in eastern central europe . 
  oooh the \u00d6vp are also fighting for the god fearing austrian under the great [ buarli ] ( https://europeanwesternbalkans.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/kurc.jpg ) . 
  well our minister of interior also awfully smells like vodka . 
  rich people ? 
  you mean successful people who only say what the pc police does n't want hard working normal austrians to hear . 
  it 's just purely accidental that they were deeply involved in several of the biggest corruption scandals in the country 's history . 
  add austria soon . 
  some say we 're the fifth v. 
  much less `` pragmatic '' . 
  working together with extreme right wingers just because they 're popular does n't work .

  also [ leberk\u00e4se ] ( http://oekastatic.orf.at/static/images/site/oeka/20140939/fotolia_58940308_subscription_xxl.5291634.jpg ) in a roll or cut up to eat in small bites is really popular but the bavarians may want to claim that as their own .

  i 'm pretty left but i am for private gun ownership . 
  although not to the ridiculous levels of the us . 
  suvs are supposed to be cars that can go offroad but most of them are just stuck in the city . 
  i know a lot of people who own jack wolfskin but do n't use them for outdoor activities . 
  jack wolfskin is the suv of clothes . 
  if another eu country is under attack . 
  i meditate . 
  it really calms you down and makes you aware of all the things that are happening . 
  if there 's one thing i love , it 's things that multiple continents have in common . 
  it makes you feel at home away from home . 
  guess what ? 
  it is . 
  what about [ bimbo binder ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_binder?wprov=sfla1 ) ?
