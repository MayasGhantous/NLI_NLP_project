  it 's just a signal to tell everyone , even those that are let 's say a farmer in the fields to just get to anywhere save asap . 
  what happens in cases like nuclear attack ? 
  do n't you have special signals for different disasters ? 
  most filipinos i know in austria are either working as nurses , caretakers for the elderly or cashiers . 
  so far i have n't heard anything too bad from anyone . 
  of course there 's sometimes comments from some old racists but fo n't mind them . 
  they most likely wo n't leave their homes so you wo n't encounter them . 
  stop making me homesick !, 
  see producing and evil .

  but every winter you come south to conquer our pistes . 
  we have to be as nice and friendly as possible to children who may have never heard the words good behaviour . 
  i 'm giving my 110 % with everyone but it 's kind of shit if you get absolutely nothing as a recognition , not even a thank you . 
  edit : best thing is that many dutch have no shame . 
  they always take the cheapest rooms in my family 's hotel . 
  then they leave their doors open and let their children run around the hallways . 
  and when it 's time for departure we actually have to give them exact change to the cent . 
  i do n't want to sound like i hate the dutch . 
  you 're a great and friendly people . 
  but when you get bad dutch people you get stingy , unfriendly bastards who have never heard of manners and wo n't teach them to their their children in any way . 
  and that 's why you 're the least favourite customers for ski instructors . 
  people in the same generation do n't act the same way . 
  the point is that they grew up in the same world . 
  like how you can say we have a generation growing up in a world of digital media . 
  your freedom ends where someone else 's freedom starts . 
  what is eastern europe ? 
  i 'm not even sure if i 'm east or west . 
  well you 're calling them states . 
  and those are called territories . 
  they 're called provinces . 
  well it depends on how you see it . 
  but in some points yes definetly . 
  the room . 
  we watch it every time my girlfriend comes over . 
  i do n't hate any accents but if i had to choose anything modern from the ruhr valley . 
  or anyone who thinks they 're speaking better german even though they pronounce the ch as an sch . 
  i as a linguistics student think that we should differentiate between grammatical genus and gender more . 
  because there 's plenty languages that do n't base their genus system on gender . 
  grammatical gender is only corresponding to the conventional genders by chance . 
  there 's plenty of languages that use genders like e.g. 
  round things , long metal things . 
  [ the brenner basistunnel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brenner_base_tunnel?wprov=sfla1 ) is the largest project in the country iirc . 
  one of the richest an oldest cultures that kind of got fucked over for the whole 20th century . 
  we could be much better friends with our neighbours . 
  give it back then . 
  in my school you could have french in the seventh year . 
  but then latin was obligatory for 9th . 
  tyrol was named after a castle named tyrol in a town named tyrol . 
  in austria it 's 1 - very good 2 - good 3 - satisfying 4 - sufficient 5 - insufficient it stays like that even in uni . 
  whoops i meant except . 
  1.90 m is a good bit above average but except my mum and my dad i 'm the shortest in the family . 
  edit : a word, 
  i used to think between 15 and 20 like in my school was normal . 
  but appearantly this was relatively small due to us being very rural . 
  queen was and is my favourite band . 
  my girlfriend adores them, 
  itt : the dutch, 
  god i grew up with this . 
  when i was 5 i was always running around begging my brother to play `` sonnelied , sonnelied !, 
  ahhh falco !, 
  such a national treasure . 
  this is right up my alley, 
  a truly beautiful language . 
  so the common linnets are still trying to pass as americans ? 
  this is amazing !, 
  i see croat trash and raise [ austrian trash ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55rljctl-b4 ) . 
  is there any songs you can recommend ? 
  on the countryside they can be dicks if you are related to someone they do n't like . 
  `` are there feminists in university or real women ? '', 
  it 's always a delight coming home . 
  yes please everyone else fuck off from our planet as our motto aeiou means that all of earth is under austrian dominion . 
  often we have aisles with stuff imported from the balkans , near east and far east . 
  better than what the czechs call us . 
  they named us after the first city they had over the border . 
  ok that actually sounds more like austria except for fptp system . 
  the only non-european country i went to when i was n't a baby was canada and it looks like a great place to live . 
  i once dated an american girl named makenzi . 
  that was the worst spelling possible . 
  i guess we 're not popular or progressive enough to be colorado , are we ? 
  stereotypical names would be bello or rex . 
  especially rex is popular for german shepherds because of kommissar rex an austrian crime show from the nineties that was about a police dog . 
  how about we try hungary again ? 
  as someone who moved to vienna from tyrol : i love your soft water . 
  the steinadler is the national eagle . 
  and that 's a golden eagle . 
  using words like `` sorry pals '' . 
  explaining the situation why you think that helps a lot too . 
  right now you 're coming off as if it 's none of our business to know . 
  and those do n't dictate the foreign policies of the netherlands . 
  stop being patronising just because you do n't like how a country is called . 
  the majority of countries do though . 
  edit : why downvoting ? 
  i was just asking a question . 
  i do n't think so . 
  there 's no dialects i 'm especially attracted to . 
  there 's plenty i ca n't stand though . 
  [ tiroler unterland ] ( https://youtu.be/g28zk2ssmci?t=47s ) is always a treat to listen to because my mum is from that area . 
  but how much do you pay to get to the airport ? 
  everything north of bavaria is a lost cause except the high north . 
  my girlfriend is from england .
