yes it can mean platonic , but is it really used that way ? 
  that 's not really platonic though . 
  it 's usually used for romantic relationships . 
  but the christmas markets are only open until christmas right ? 
  at least in my coty they are . 
  as op is here december/january they might miss it . 
  yeah helping out countries ? 
  like invading them on false pretenses ? 
  destabilizing regions ? 
  replacing leaders of a foreign country for their own benefit ? 
  and why the fuck are there still american soldiers in germany ? 
  if they really wanted to help , their actions would be a lot different . 
  of course they are powerful and we need them as an ally . 
  and big powerful countries have some responsibility to get involved when hwlp is needed . 
  but that 's not what is happening now . 
  how can they thank their soldiers for their service ? 
  and act like they are just `` protecting '' their home and bringing freedom . 
  it just sounds so brainwashed . 
  in the eyes of many other countries they are simply invaders and killers . 
  how did i miss that ? 
  wow i did not even know we had tornadoes . 
  i know a few people from erzgebierge . 
  many young people i know have left by now . 
  it 's really bad . 
  i think the fact that obama is a lot more like the kind of politician we have and/or like also plays a big role . 
  he is diplomatic , eloquent , respectable background and his political ideas also were more in line with ours . 
  our conservatives are not trumps conservatives though , they do n't really share the same ideas . 
  and that somebody who had at one point a tv show and a `` trump university '' is considered fit to be president is quite weird for us . 
  and his stupid tweets ( i am not sure our politicians tweet at all ) , the trophy wife , his way of speaking etc. 
  all that makes him more of an american [ lugner ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_lugner ) than a real politician in our eyes . 
  i hope you know what i mean . 
  sometimes my english sucks . 
  `` and merkel really believed she was the only german we did not spy on . '', 
  regarding pepper spray , in austria we can also only buy it to defend ourselves from animals ( like dogs etc ) , but if you are in danger and need to act in self defense you can use the pepper spray against people as well . 
  my sister had to report a theft while we were wild camping here in austria . 
  she openly told the police officer that we were camping there . 
  he thought about it for a moment and then just wrote down `` were enjoying the nature '' , 
  there is also a little of confusion as deutsch means the language and the nationality . 
  but i still think we have been a seperate country long enough and there really are enough cultural differences ( if you compare it to parts other than bavaria ) to stop considering us german . 
  would anybody seriously consider the us to be british ? 
  i doubt that . 
  so why say we are german ? 
  being one country with the those piefke did rub off a little bit though . 
  at least written italian and spanish are quite similar . 
  my friends who learned italian in school could usually read my spanish homeworks too . 
  it does not exclusively mean swearing , but in my experience it is very often used to excuse swearing or at least inappropriate words . 
  interestingly i got the impression that protestants are more conservative . 
  i know one family where the girls had no sex before marriage and i know two seventh day adventists and i heard about conversion therapy etc. 
  when i asked about gay people and if they could be friends with them one seventh day adventist and an older protestant friend both said yes , but it is still wrong . 
  most catholic people i know are more in the `` love whoever you want '' camp especially the people my age . 
  we have registered partnerships and they are almost equal to marriages . 
  a couple of years ago adoption was also made legal . 
  now it 's mostly smaller difference like where they can get `` married '' , that it is not called marriage and apparently weird stuff like they have a last name and not like others a family name ( i do n't really get that , but apparently they just wanted to emphasize that homosexual families are not real families and so they can share a name , but it 's not a family name ) . 
  i do n't really know , i never heard about anything being in another city . 
  but let 's look at our cities : vienna has 1.8 million people . 
  graz is the second biggest with 280.000 . 
  so there really is only vienna and then the rest . 
  you probably wo n't need it in salzburg . 
  they are used to tourists . 
  but i am not sure if they always have english menus etc. 
  i never expected that i would learning g something so interesting about farm houses today . 
  thanks for that  and i never realised that this was such a regional thing . 
  i guess i should pay more attention to farmhouses from now on . 
  when i googled it i got pictures [ like that ] ( https://media05.regionaut.meinbezirk.at/2016/08/31/11162098_web.jpg?1472668158 ) . 
  which might be true for the alpes etc , i never really payed attention . 
  in my area they look like [ this ] ( http://mein.salzburg.com/fotoblog/heimat/assets_c/2010/07/ottenschlag_2_p1000294-thumb-1024xauto-56020.jpg ) . 
  because there is a lot of granite in the ground they liked to use it for building houses . 
  it is usually also a square , called a [ vierkanter ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/38858634.jpg ), 
  honestly yes . 
  i can understand electing politicians i disagree with . 
  most of them at least know their job , they are very eloquent and know how to influence their voters . 
  but trump is nothing like that , he does not seem very intelligent , eloquent , knowledgeable or disciplined . 
  he is not trying to hide his racism , sexism etc. 
  it does not even sound like he thinks about what he wants to say , he just blurts it out . 
  so yeah i have no idea why anyone would elect him . 
  it 's not like you have to be very clever to see through his lies and manipulations . 
   if it had been something like 51 vs 49 % , we would probably still be waiting for the final result like we did last year ? 
  gosh that was nerve wrecking . 
  that 's definitely not enough . 
  austria has more than two dialects . 
  i feel a little bit insulted that i am in the same group as vienna ... 
  i think it would be great if younger kids had less holidays ( i wonder how the parents do it , if you do n't have grandparents nearby ) and more when they are old enough to work an travel . 
  we get 9 weeks . 
  so most work like a month during the summer ( when they are 16 ) . 
  i really think that 's enough . 
  and it 's not like we have to pay for a car at that age , 
  i started working summer jobs at 16 . 
  many of my friends did too . 
  but during the school year we focus on school . 
  because school can already be stressful enough and they are still kids after all ? 
  ca n't they enjoy some free time while they are still young ? 
  i feel like in the us there is a lot more pressure on young people and i am not sure if this is healthy . 
  i live in a city and i do n't even hear that . 
  now that makes me wonder what would happen in case of an actual emergency ... 
  probably less popular than in the us , but i do n't see a problem ( especially the new york yankee cap ) . 
  i think the bigger question is what you want to wear with them ? 
  just do n't wear [ capris ] ( https://www.google.at/search?client=ms-android-tmobile-at&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=249&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=9eqjwc3_hozmwqliy6-qdq&amp;q=capris+men&amp;oq=capris+men&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-img.3..0i19k1l4j0i5i30i19k1.6911.7889.0.8696.7.7.0.0.0.0.204.909.0j5j1.6.0....0...1c.1j4.64.mobile-gws-img..1.3.508...0i8i7i30k1.nkv9ofl-1mq#imgrc=oqg5p-wq-mgo5m: ) and a shirt that 's too big . 
  i think we wear more fitting clothes . 
  more tailored . 
  i do n't know what 's the right word .
