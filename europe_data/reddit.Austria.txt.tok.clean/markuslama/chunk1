australia, 
  do n't forget that krankl & prohaska also had a music career : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kf91c8pmnm, 
  we also share a lot of common history with turkey or france . 
  or just about every nation in europe . 
  i think what op means is that the now-existing nations of germany and austria have had different paths to where they are now . 
  being next door neighbours , those paths have crossed or even overlapped many times , but were not bound to each other . 
  btw : i also want a tardis . 
  the comedic duo christoph & lollo did songs about every austrian party a few years back : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=plhcwtbt2nam_z2id5nkjxwimej4jkir5c also , a song about our former finance minister : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95y-ezdys7a it 's about when karl-heinz grasser is finally going to prison . 
  arik brauers ' `` k\u00f6pferl im sand '' is more of a general protest song , but still noteworthy : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdefykmgepq, 
  those trains are operated by a private company that 's not subsidized by any tax payer money . 
  they 're paying the \u00d6bb for usage of the rails and stations . 
  they have to be profitable . 
  i regularly take the train to vienna . 
  it 's about 160 miles , takes less than 2 hours and costs around 25 $ . 
  so , it 's definitely beatable . 
  italia . 
  we could call it australia and confuse everyone . 
  someone recently posted this pronounciation map in / r/austria : https://i.redd.it/29tm7esr6iwy.jpg also , it 's habsburg , not hapsburg . 
  four times . 
  once , or elderly neighbour was shouting for help in the middle of the night and broke her hip . 
  once , because i found a drunk woman with a head wound sitting on the street near our house . 
  once , because my neighbours were shouting . 
  i went out to the hall to see what was happening and their teenage daughter opened the door and asked me to call the police . 
  and finally , once because a drunk , giant russian refugee i worked with threw a chair through our office window . 
  nah , did n't work too well the last time ... 
  the 626 million is a fact , and it is expected to rise ( if nothing really unexpected happens ) - i 'm not arguing about that . 
  i also did n't say that it is n't a problem . 
  what i 'd like to see is people talking about constructive solutions without being shouted down by fearmongers . 
   presse : vienna pays welfare to people without id well , the pressse seems to contradict itself ... see # 4 http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/wien/5171575/sozialhilfe_missstand-bei-mindestsicherung  in dem fall dreht sich alles um das wort \u201e g\u00fcltig `` . 
  just to clarify a few things :  ... investigating a statment released by a whistleblower a few months back ... 
  the investigation is said to be routine , other states were investigated too . 
   ... is expecting to spend 1.6 billions a year on welfare in the year 2021 . 
  they arravied at this number using data from the height of the refugee crisis , expecting this trend to continue . 
  this has not been the case . 
   the report also said , that people have been receiving welfare without ever having to show an id it should be `` valid id '' , not `` no id '' . 
  this is mostly about out-of-date passports , which , while technically `` invalid '' are still accepted as id for a few years after the expiration date . 
   this was a direct order from the higher ups i ca n't find a reputable source for this statement  children who most likely do n't exist this is about exactly 27 cases . 
  there may or may not be fraud involved . 
   the city government claims it 's all not really true , ... 
  they claim that the numbers are partially out-of-date , ...  ... nobody should worry ... ... they said that they `` will not return to normal order of business . '', 
   ... liar or a moron . 
  i get my information from standard , kurier and presse , three of the most reputable newspapers in austria . 
  maybe the heute writes something different , i would n't know . 
  i would upvote you , but i think i can lose my citizenship for aiding a prussian . 
  it 's basically the same in austria . 
  austria would be even less relevant than it already is . 
  i think / u/maninthewoods was referring to the rote armee fraktion , a leftwing terror group , who killed more than 30 people in germany . 
  from my perspective not even that stron of an accent , but i guess for non-native speakers it could be quite hard to understand . 
  someone with a really thick accent would be [ hubert von goisern ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jtxuznhsmo ) . 
  [ `` jedermann '' by pizzera & jaus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=datdjqaljza ) i have to say , it 's surprisingly good . 
  come on , liechtenstein , we can take them !, 
  germany, 
  austria has six national parks : [ hohe tauern ] ( http://media.get24.at/3dakmedia/ppm_3dak_kw_nht/system_box_bigview/2465.jpg ) [ kalkalpen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/hintergebirge_01.jpg ) [ thaya-tal ] ( http://www.nationalparksaustria.at/pages/de/kat/7/umlaufberg-fruehling_br-np-thayatal_mirau.jpg ) [ donau-auen ] ( http://www.donau.com/fileadmin/user_upload/_processed_/csm_rc_np_auwald_c_popp_bbb9d40da1.jpg ) [ ges\u00e4use ] ( http://www.steiermark.com/website/var/tmp/image-thumbnails/16492/thumb__contentgallerybig/1618_tamischbachturm_nationalpark_gesaeuse.jpeg ) [ neusiedler see ] ( http://www.stmartins.at/files/content/tiere-pflanzen-landschaft/safari-stm-nationalpark-luftaufnahme.jpg ), 
  dumplings made out of ground meat and rice , wrapped in cabbage leaves , eaten with sour cream . 
  the only one i 've ever seen or heard of is in my apartment building . 
  it was built in the late 70s and immediatly converted into storage units . 
  no , i would say the close second is trying to pet free-ranging calfes . 
  cows really do n't like that . 
  they did ? 
  i only know that they closed up shop in vienna . 
  hiking up a mountain underequipped . 
  i live near the [ traunstein ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/traunstein_ ( berg ) , which has quite a few secure and easy ways up , but still there are at least a couple of dead tourists each year . 
  best case scenario are the people who try to get up there in crocs and need a helicopter ride down . 
  dunkin' donuts recently had to pull out of austria due to low sales . 
  people bought donuts but nothing else . 
  also , starbucks is not doing too well , they had to close down their vienna flagship store . 
  seems like people prefer their caf\u00e9s more personal and their coffee to go cheaper . 
  do n't forget the good old `` zrei\u00dfn solls di in lauter tausender ! '', 
  which translates to `` may you explode into 1000 schilling notes . '', 
  yeah , austria is weird . 
  at least according to our national anthem . 
  yeah , happens every time i speak to someone from vorarlberg or bad goisern . 
  i 'm just like `` wos woits ihr vo mir ? 
  [ why not ? 
  it can be quite beautiful . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvaqdneppwq ), 
  ca n't get around corporate guidelines , no matter how stupid they are . 
  you have to ask what language they want and respect their choice . 
  there were actually quite a few people ( americans mostly ) who wanted the german version plus the printed version ( we had those on hand in about 15 languages ) of the text in english . 
  yeah , if i did my math right , i had about 15 seconds per person on an average day . 
  now , i was always happy to chat when i had the time , recommend other attractions , restaurants , tell some fun facts . 
  but when i got 50 people in a room as big as my livingroom , waiting in line , that 's not the time to `` prank '' me . 
  thank god i got out of there before the owner started cutting back on personell . 
  legit reason : maybe he 's trying to learn japanese ? 
  this one was clearly trying to be funny , because japanese = haha . 
  i really loved all the wes anderson movies i watched , with `` moonrise kingdom '' being my favourite . 
  a while back , i worked at a major tourist attraction in vienna for about a year . 
  obviously , this is a broad generalization , but : germans : you are not entitled to anything extra . 
  you are exactly as important as all the other people . 
  a little politeness would n't kill you . 
  oh , and if you ask for your audio guide in japanase , even after i ask you if you 're serious , you do n't get to complain 10 minutes later that i gave you a japanese audio guide . 
  japanese : you know that i do n't speak japanese ? 
  talking louder and faster wo n't help me understand you . 
  russians : could you keep it down , please ? 
  americans : you can be crazy enthusiastic . 
  it 's fine , i 'm happy you 're having a good time , but i still got a job to do . 
  there 's 50 people in this room , waiting for service , i really do n't have the time to chat with you right now . 
  some people seem to think that austrians are just relaxed germans . 
  yeah , anyone who learned standard german is in for a big surprise in most of austria . 
  there are germans who hardly understand us .
