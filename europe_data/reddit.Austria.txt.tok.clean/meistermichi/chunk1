  http://kurier.at/chronik/oesterreich/nicht-gegendert-millionen-strafzettel-in-oesterreich-vernichtet/145.383.987 i do n't think there is an english news about it . 
  me too . 
  i mean , how efficient is it to destroy millions of unused traffic tickets because they are not `` gender correct '' worded ? 
  not only the enourmous material value but even more so the unnecassary work time needed for this , since each ticket of an started ticket book needs to be removed manually from the computer system , is horrendous . 
  i feel with you . 
  also on the depressing part ... 
  what a surprise ... 
  aldi for you . 
  i 'll let yourself decide whether you want nord oder s\u00fcd . 
  please raise now for our glorious [ national anthem ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lo0qmmnuktq ) . 
  nah , i 'm sure ireland is gon na support you with enough potatoes . 
  looks like the u.s. deployment of more armored vehicles in eastern europe did n't have the desired effect . 
  i for one welcome our new russian overlords . 
  now that you mentioned it , for the last few years i only got new banknotes out of the atm ... 
  but i remember getting used ones back in the days , kinda weird . 
  what do you think all those mountains are for ? 
  now i know why [ cities : skylines ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7yzjnr4.png ) puts so much signs on old buildings .

  wwiii incoming . 
  yeah , we need to save our standard measurement tool . 
  kinda sad to see how small our country is now . 
  and what did we gain from it ? 
  not much i guess . 
  ^ ( miss you south tyrol . ), 
  its even more important than the wave . 
  your flair makes this comment quite funny . 
  `` independent '' ... receives more funding from the greens than any other candidate from their respective party . 
   ... the war to end all wars began . 
  well , that plan got fucked up too i guess . 
  well that 's exactly what 's happening . 
  644,8 mio $ to provide mobility for everyone , everywhere in austria . 
  in return \u00d6bb are obliged to maintain the railway connections even on unprofitable lines i would n't necessarily count it as profit if a state owned company gets funds from the state to maintain the lines . 
  the state just pays itself . 
  for lines in rural areas it is . 
  if \u00d6bb would only operate on the profitable lines a lot of people would get fucked over . 
  my buddy does this too . 
  when i first saw it i was like `` dude , there 's already fucking tomato sauce on it . '', 
  top post in / r/lifeprotips / tommorow,

  just to clarify , austria is not part of nato .

  i think we did it reddit . 
  he only came to power in germany so you only need to worry when hofer gets involved in german politics . 
  there 's a lot of reasons to mail vote . 
  i even know a lot of people who just voted that way because they were too lazy to go to the polling station . 
  so they have them all already !, 
  do n't forget our awesome \u00c4 and \u00dc, 
  to me they are both barbaric . 
  \\ #saucefreefries, 
  not sure if you are the one who remembers or the only member of whore .

  bus driver : `` the intersection was full of people and on fire . '', 
  you really want me to believe this bullshit ? 
  get outta her and never comeback you idiota . '',

  that 's 7,571 litres if you are using us liquid gallons or 9,092 litres if it 's in imperial gallons . 
  we 're civilised here , please use metric units .
