i totally agree . 
  when it 's cold you can always just add clothes but when it 's hot you 'll run out of clothes to take off eventually . 
  while the `` real '' wiener schnitzel is made of veal most schnitzel is made of pork nowadays . 
  ( called `` schnitzel wiener art '' ) probably a good reason to put us in the `` 14 y/o homemade bomb target '' list .

  faeroe should be red . 
  just checked on eurostat , you are correct . 
  85 % russians , 5 % georgians , 10 % other . 
  as a father of two i agree wholeheartedly . 
  i am relatively knowledgeable on this case and comments about it always shock me every time . 
  very little empathy . 
  also a lot of free riding off german excess production . 
  oh , absolutely not . 
  i think it should be at each member states ' discretion what energy sources they pursue . 
  i was just trying to outline how ridiculous the austrian government 's position here is . 
  the czechs can tell you a thing or two about it . 
  austria has an anti-atom law ( literally called like that ) . 
  ca n't argue with that . 
  this reminded me of [ `` der bockerer '' ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nxlv0uzxwk ) edit : tl ; dw bockerer sells his `` unused naziflag '' angering the authorities because his mandatory flag is hanging out the toilet window . 
  he goes ahead buying a huge one that would touch the ground so he rolls it up ( now it 's just showing plain red ) making it look like a communist flag . 
  viennese are also said to be very morbid . 
  unfortunately i ca n't find a decent english article/documentary on it . 
  i think you are confusing globalnews.ca with globalresearch.ca, 
  austria imported 40 % of its electricity in the first quarter .

  i am not very well educated on the religious relevance and practice of these but to my knowledge this is what they are about : epiphany = the three magi visit jesus easter monday = jesus ' death ascension day = jesus goes to heaven white sunday / pentecost = jesus comes back corpus christi = mourning about jesus finished , time to celebrate assumption of mary = maria goes to heaven feast of the immaculate conception = maria gets pregnant st. stephen 's day = stephen was the first christian who died for his faith hopefully somebody can correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  shamelessly copied from wikipedia : day | name ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- | -------------- | --------- | -------- | - | ------------- | ----- | --------------------------- | - | ------------- | - | ---------------------- | - | -------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ---------- | --------------------- | ------ | --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- | ----------------- 1 january | new year 's day 6 january | epiphany easter + 1 | easter monday 1 may | international workers ' day easter + 39 | ascension day easter + 50 | whit sunday / pentecost easter + 60 | corpus christi 15 august | assumption of mary 26 october | austrian national day 1 november | all saints ' day 8 december | feast of the immaculate conception 25 december | christmas day 26 december | st. stephen 's day the only overlap i can see are new year 's and christmas day . 
  labour/workers and independence/national day are similar though . 
  wei\u00df = white wei\u00dfrussland = [ white russia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white_russia ), 
  i have to admit i am shocked by portugal , some countries are definitely under their `` value '' but putting portugal on the same level of tourist destination as belarus is just mean . 
  it elects the judges of the echr and a couple of other less important coe positions . 
  also a lot of discussions ( human rights , democracy , etc. ) . 
  the members are chosen from the national parliaments ( by the parliaments ) , they are not elected separately . 
  because of 1 . it is really not all that relevant . 
  meetings are just a couple of times a year . 
  the only reasons it could make the news would be a controversial judge for the echr . 
  did you know russia is currently suspended from the pa of the coe ? 
  i 'm not even sure russia knows that . 
  the mosque in question is a well known salafist center and has been under observation of our domestic intelligence for a long time .

  and [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9zdw6dwj7g ) is he talking about conchita wurst ( calls her embarrassing , says she has an identity crisis ) . 
  stadler also formed a new party [ `` rekos '' ] ( http://www.cpoe.or.at/bilder/images/rekos%20logo%20pur.jpg ) reform conservatives . 
  the only reason he is still around is his rhetorical talent .

  kind of funny how some words are randomly close together like `` world war '' on the left , `` fuck euro '' in upside down ukrainian flag colors and right in the middle `` ukraine goverment nato party '' . 
  very interesting nevertheless , thank you !,

  this may suit the task better : http://www.sporcle.com/games/g/europe, 
  it is roughly the low end of what you can get if you have any marketable job skills in austria and i would certainly not accept such a job . 
  living of that would only be possible if you live in a rural/cheap area and have no transport to account for to commute to your job . 
  are you really surprised ? 
  he was almost ousted multiple times by his party , frequently lacked internal support and everyone agrees that he is super incompetent . 
  he even threatened to resign only half a year ago . 
  it honesty does n't make much of a difference for me at all . 
  the words i ca n't figure out are almost the same in both : * onverveerd * vrees * altijd * verdreven * regeren after reading it again vrees is fear and onverveerd is `` without fear '' maybe ? 
  kind of funny that bbc reporting this is bigger news in austrian media than the actual robbing .

  funny fact : the zugspitze is on the german-austrian border but the austrian `` side '' is higher .

  we still use the sea level of trieste as a measure . 
  so even the highest mountain of germany is higher in austria . 
  in the beginning he describes the situation , he is in erbil and they will fly in the mountains to pick up aid and then run an airlift operation to sinjar all day . 
  however at the end he says that they ran out of kerosene after the very first flight he documented and could n't even get back to erbil .
