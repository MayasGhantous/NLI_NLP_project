  the commission president has little to no say in that decision . 
  i would n't vote based on who is going to be the president . 
  while this is certainly an important position it is better to have an mep support your ideas in the parliament and the committees . 
  the majorities are too close to make much of a difference on the position anyways they are both around 210 + / - 20 and neither is guaranteed to get the job even if they win as they still need a safe majority ( 400-ish ) . 
  tl ; dr vote for the party that represents your opinion . 
  edit : the commissioners will also be from all kinds of different parties anyways . 
  it is a close race between sp\u00d6 ( social democrats - s&d ) and \u00d6vp ( conservatives - epp ) but it does n't really matter as they are so close that they will probably both get 5 or 4 mandates depending on the performance of the other parties . 
  it was a really weak campaign altogether all parties have pretty bad candidates and most of them focused on national issues . 
  nothing in austria , but i guess that is maybe because our pirate party runs under a different name together with the communists . 
  there is an understanding that the bavarians are as close as germans get to be austrians or vice versa . 
  the mentality , dialect and the culture are similar but austria has a lot of eastern and southern european influences and a couple of dialects and subcultures that do n't exist in bavaria . 
  germans are often just meshed together from an austrian pov and in most discussions we would n't distinguish between states in particular or talk about the evil northeners enslaving our bavarian brothers . 
  it is kinda based on a little inferiority complex : `` everyone knows germany will beat us any day of the week in almost anything besides skiing . 
  let us poke fun at them that one time we are better than them ! '', 
  edit : also a prime example for `` schadenfreude '' . 
  i might have misread your post . 
  yeah it is a weird thing to do to a culture especially when it came to the whole disassociation from nazi crimes ( `` it was the germans , we - the austrians - were absolutely innocent , i swear we are their first victim ! '' ), 
  which is imho a prime reason why our far right can gain 25 % + in polls and even sit in our government like some fucked up fascist state . 
  austrian identity did n't exist up until after ww2 . 
  austrians considered themselves germans even to the point were they first named their state post ww1 `` german-austria '' . 
  ( it was renamed soon afterwards ) as a condition for the soviets to let austria become a free country they wanted it to be constitutionally neutral . 
  part of this neutrality was to never ever reunite again with germany . 
  to make sure the general population would n't favor another `` anschluss '' the government and media strengthened the austrian identity and this became a thing to the extent were austrians are almost `` anti-german '' even though they are ethnically southern germans . 
  this becomes especially obvious in sports and other competitions . 
  while the germans look at the austrians like their `` little friends '' and root for them a lot of austrians actually look at the germans like they are their archenemy and even celebrate when germany loses . 
  it has a pretty decent soundtrack so i guess that is to be expected if you are in germany . 
  i hope at least the other link works ? 
  psa for german speakers : austrian orf also has a great new format `` wahlfahrt '' ( election ride ) a bit of a wordplay on wallfahrt ( pilgrimage ) . 
  where a reporter ( hanno settele ) takes politicians on a ride with his old mercedes and interviews them . 
  it kind of shows the politicians in a much more `` in the moment '' way and as real humans as opposed to these debates where they are much more `` professional '' . 
  the latest episode had schulz and keller and it was absolutely brilliant . 
  link to the [ vod ] ( http://tvthek.orf.at/program/wahlfahrt-europa/7876326/wahlfahrt-europa/7874478/wahlfahrt-europa/7883356 ) ( with german subtitles ) or alternatively [ youtube ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xk-beymthu ), 
  he also publishes his own anti-semitic , nazist , german nationalist , right wing weekly , has been recently exposed for writing racist articles under an alias and is currently being prosecuted for hate speech . 
  yet his party still gets 20-25 % in polls . 
  absolutely disturbing . 
  i do n't think so . 
  the chinese bought an old unfinished carrier from russia and they could pass through and i guess the soviets would not have built it in the first place if it was too narrow/shallow . 
  but iirc there is an international treaty limiting the total tonnage of ships from non-black sea littoral states passing through or something . 
  edit : the [ treaty ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montreux_convention_regarding_the_regime_of_the_straits ) i meant . 
  we currently spend < 0,6 % of our gdp . 
  our defence minister recently made a pledge to save a ton of money because the forces ca n't sustain their current state without increasing the budget . 
  some even think the austrian armed forces are on the verge of collapsing . 
  our latest change in military policy was to make military service `` more fun '' for conscripts . 
  our latest big procurement should have been about two dozens of modern multi-role jets . 
  we ended up with a dozen ( half of them used ) typhoon fighters that are effectively barred from air to ground missions and a huge corruption case . 
  our trainer / light bomber planes are some of the oldest in the western world and should have been replaced a decade ago but we do n't have the money for it so we quietly keep flying these museum pieces . 
  we also need new light apcs , new helicopters , new utility vehicles and a lot of our other equipment is older than the oldest people serving . 
  we like to tell ourselves that we are non-aligned or even neutral but the fact is we could barely keep up our territorial integrity against anyone or anything and should be worried about liechtenstein-ian bankers invading us . 
  i might be slightly biased but i am not a super militarist . 
  i do n't think we should spend huge amounts of money that could be used wiser otherwise but i think we should keep a military force that can perform tasks if needed . 
  i doubt that our politicians are capable of that so i 'll have to hope for an eu wide initiative . 
  this is great : first a group of serbs waving german and austrian flags and then all other pegida demonstrators interviewed have german accents . 
  the only austrian seems to be the guy telling people to read the quran . 
  consequently this is remembered as one of the lowest moments in austrian football of all time . 
  [ das wunder von cordoba ( the miracle of cordoba ) ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austria_v_west_germany_ ( 1978_fifa_world_cup \\ ) ) perfectly exemplifies the post war view of germans here in austria . 
  the match itself had absolutely no relevance for austria , the team had no chance of progressing but there was one goal : eliminating the germans out of the cup . 
  the team fought fiercely and ultimately won . 
  [ the original commentary is legendary ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bso-rtgpnm ) and a lot of the team members are still remembered as some of the greatest austrian players of all time . 
  there was also that time we beat the gdr 3:0 and qualified for the 1990 world cup . 
  it takes a while to process them and the bureaucracy is rather tame . 
  you can see the total number of finished asylum processes goes up as the number of applicants rises albeit significantly slower .

   mr. georgiou 's strict application of eurostat 's standards to greece 's public finances has angered some greek politicians , who have accused him of inflating the budget deficit to help justify the country 's unpopular bailout .
