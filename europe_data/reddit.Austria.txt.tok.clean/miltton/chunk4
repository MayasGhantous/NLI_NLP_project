  he calls tsipras `` unnecessarily stubborn '' for refusing the last commission proposal and reaffirms the view that a `` no '' means grexit . 
  kind of surprised renzi would go that hard on tsipras . 
  kind of depressing that the only vote you guys got was actually against same-sex marriage . 
  even though it was already constitutionally banned . 
  highest support in any country without it . 
  * sigh *, 
  i feel the same way . 
  the rhetoric on both sides is way to heated . 
  i just hope for a compromise before this turns into a catastrophe . 
  it 's an odd situation . 
  the referendum is set after the deadline of the current program but if the creditors say no to an extension tsipras would probably accuse them of being undemocratic or suppressing the greek people 's opinion . 
  if the ecb would keep ela without a program until after the referendum they would be accused of overstepping their mandate . 
  above all the imf could classify a non-payment as delay instead of a default that would probably not lead to a significant credit event according to the esm and ela could be kept in place until mid july . 
  i 'll be an interesting week . 
  i have no details on what / u/ariskatsaris says but [ here ] ( http://www.ppp.mnec.gr/sites/default/files/financial_files/state_%20budget_execution_may_2015.pdf ) are the official budget numbers . 
  they are 1.7 bn ( more than 10 % ) short on tax revenues and cut the primary budget by roughly the same amount . 
  it 's pretty rough . 
  ironically you can even see the little vegan/vegetarian logos on the can to the far left . 
  i agree that the difference between changing one or three bulbs is negligible and this is a very logical , pragmatic solution but just to be pedantic maintenance costs far more than electricity :  4.700 euro wartungskosten , 750 euro stromrechnung im jahr, 
  i have no doubt . 
  our politicians are far to incompetent to be this pragmatic , they would have found a '' \u00d6sterreichsiche l\u00f6sung '' . 
  ( aka costlier and overtly complex ), 
  probably the most german thing ever : the law says we have to install a traffic light , but it says nothing about it actually ever turning green so that 's fine . 
  by the way we also maintain the yellow and green light because ordnung muss sein . 
  tens of thousands of kosovars crossed into hungary via serbia early this year . 
  people tend to overestimate how efficient normal border controls are - normal as in not the berlin wall . 
  what shelters the uk from this is the channel . 
  awesome video , thanks for sharing . 
  i wish this policy was more common . 
  street workers ( trained psychologists ) approaching the addicts and trying to help them without judging them makes so much more sense than prosecuting them , which is only going to worsen their situation . 
  ( and waste taxpayers money ), 
  that is the failure of the previous government and not on the creditors . 
  new auditors for the sgpr were supposed to be hired back in ** 2011 ** . 
  [ source on the meeting ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/03/eurozone-greece-tsipras-idusl9n0xc00320150603 ) he said the thing about the follow up proposal at todays g7 press conference q&a , i can look for the actual footage if you want but this [ poltico article ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/tsipras-juncker-lifeline-g7-crisis/ ) discusses it as well . 
  the commission was always the `` weakest link '' ( from a german pespective ) in the troika . 
  and juncker specifically stands firm against the german economic narrative and austerity ( see the commissions handling of italian and french edps ) . 
  http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/jean-claude-juncker-poses-challenge-to-merkel-and-austerity-policies-a-1017505.html more on the latest quarrel : http://www.politico.eu/article/tsipras-juncker-lifeline-g7-crisis/, 
  that proposal was discussed on wednesday and tsipras apparently pledged to follow it up with another proposal the next day but that never came . 
  juncker seems genuinely offended and tsipras may be losing his last ally . 
  i would like to throw in my idea of an even subtler design : make the flairs colour coded dots that show the text when you hover over . 
  here is my amateurish photoshop of what i mean : [ dots ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vybqqmr.png ) [ hover ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mrpqrj1.png ) what do you think ? 
  now that i see mods handing out flairs for submissions : could one of you please flair this as opinion ? 
  he said `` inaccurately '' . 
  this week is the life ball ( an aids awareness event ) , next week is the song contest and in a month there will be a rainbow parade . 
  after that they will be removed . 
  it 's just a marketing gag and it worked obviously . 
   anyone know the reason ? 
  mass emigration from kosovo this year , almost all of them will be sent back . 
   and why is orban against the eu asylum quota ( called it a `` crazy idea '' ) if hungary would be one of the beneficiaries ? 
  because hungary had a much lower annual number of applications in previous years . 
  they can just send back the kosovars but they would have to process and house asylum seekers from other countries due to the quota . 
  it should be noted that this surplus comes from extra euro area trade . 
  the trade with the euro area is almost balanced . 
  i have good news for you : you are looking at the wrong stat . 
   my table is just a comparison of forecasts , a positive value means the country is doing better than previously expected . 
  if you follow the submission you 'll see that slovakia is at 3 % growth for 2015 , inflation is negative though . 
  i quickly threw together a comparison with the previous forecast : http://i.imgur.com/baarbfq.png most countries are doing slightly better but they cut the greek forecast by two percent . 
  schweighofer has no operations in austria , only their holding and the founders are austrian . 
  they get basically zero news coverage in austria . 
  the only times i ever hear from them is through international media reporting their wrongdoing ( bribes , illegal logging etc. ), 
  endorsements are a long standing tradition in the anglosphere . 
  not surprised . 
  i do n't think they even sell them in portugal because we eat them all . 
  it 's not really surprising if you take a couple of facts into account : what drives these numbers up is self-employment : greece has the highest in the eu , germany has a rather low one . 
  what reduces them is the part-time work rate : greece has a rather low one , germany has one of the highest and the netherlands have the highest in the eu . 
  if you look at the numbers for full-time dependent employment they are all in the same range + / - 5 % . 
  on a side note : are portuguese at all aware that [ nuri sardines ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tildama.png ) are basically a national dish in austria ? 
  in the latest review ( april 2014 ) the european commission called for the introduction of an guaranteed minimum income . 
  the previous government started a pilot and it was expected to be introduced nationwide later . 
  syriza said they would evaluate it but i have n't seen any major news about the current status of the gmi . 
  that 's fine in my book . 
  i do n't think anybody here really dislikes it . 
  it 's just that most people have never seen it and are pretty dumbfounded when they first hear that the movie is so big in the rest of the world . 
  you do n't know any austrian stereotypes because like every other austrian you have never seen sound of music . 
  apparently his peak wattage is 2600 . 
  germanized slavs and slavisized germans unite !, 
   ps : bring skoda , beer and slivovitz . 
  this would be the german equivalent to your first chart : http://www.iea.org/stats/webgraphs/germany4.pdf, 
  this time it shoots in both directions !, 
  austrian chancellor would be right behind juncker ( 300.412 ) , austrian president would be the highest ( 336.462 ) . 
  `` you 're german ? '', 
  protip : they are in alphabetic order from north to south :  estonia  latvia  lithuania, 
  that 's just the maximum marginal tax rate . 
  the effective tax rate in switzerland is a fraction of the austrian one . 
  i was talking about the legal procedure itself . 
  obviously it took the national governments forever to reach a political consensus but changing that is not really within the powers of eu institutions . 
  i would n't give our government the credit for this . 
  they nationalised the bank and put billions ( potentially tens of billions ) of taxpayers euros at risk . 
  credit should go to the eu , pulling off the single resolution mechanism in record breaking time . 
  without that our politicians would still say this whole ordeal is a `` great business deal for the taxpayer '' . 
  regular units use the ak-74m , some pictures also show ak-74 and aks-74 but in much smaller numbers . 
  the official results will be posted [ here ] ( http://wahl16.bmi.gv.at/ ) . 
  [ alternative link ] ( http://orf.at/wahl/bp16/ ) from public broadcaster orf . 
  they have similar vitas and taste in young women but lugner is more of a well meaning clown , trump is much more serious about politics . 
  austrian online communities seem mostly pro van der bellen . 
  griss is probably a lot of people 's second choice . 
  i tried to keep it relatively neutral but i think that one could say that , yes . 
  feel free to . 
  i 'll try to give a quick rundown for the ** austrian presidential election ** : in austria the president is a mostly ceremonial position , he is directly elected and any austrian citizen over the age of 16 can vote . 
  if nobody wins  50 % in the first round a second round will be held with all but the two candidates receiving the most votes eliminated .
