  it took place during a time of rising criticism of the government and the out-there pussy riot performers were a great target that could be used to scare other , less objectionable , critics or set a precedent for stricter penalties ( this latter effort , if it was a areal effort , was obstructed by the domestic and international attention . 
  even rt seemed concerned and supportive of the charged women ) . 
   let russians to decide themselves what they need . 
  agreed . 
  let them . 
  let them have the tools to do this . 
  let them have fair and transparent courts , an honest and reliable church and the freedom to explain their concerns and make their cases for their ideas as well as the institutions to support them as those ideas are instituted . 
   nato on borders is a threat to the country . 
  and pussy riot affects nato military capabilities and motivations how ? 
  or does the existence of an outside threat mean that no inside growth or developments can exist ? 
  all countries have outside threats . 
  how well they handle their internal operations directly impacts how well they can respond to their outer . 
  putin and the government are not responsible for all of society 's opinions . 
  they are responsible for the laws they pass . 
  they are responsible for policy at and coverage on tv that they strongly influence . 
  neither are the point of my comment though . 
  the above comment said that a russian show with two gay dads would be fine as long as no gays are apparently having sex . 
  my response was that this is not true . 
  the only real-life tv show featuring a real-life gay person and not in a sexual context was not fine . 
  one would expect that a sitcom about nice , friendly gay people , sexual or otherwise , would be even less fine than a generally conservative news anchor just being gay . 
  to be fair , ukraine does need help . 
  be it from russia , the eu , the imf , space aliens , anyone , ukraine is in a bad spot . 
  it ca n't afford to pay for the energy it needs , even at subsidized prices from russia , it is facing default of billions in debt ( or at least it was until recent promised payments resulting from deals russia and to a less degree china , for which it had to sell out a lot of sovereignty ) , its economy is not doing well , its leadership on many levels ( not just the top ) is corrupt , kleptocratic and mob-based and it is torn by social conflict between the east and the west . 
  it is n't patronizing or arrogant to say this . 
  it is n't even unfair for russia to say `` hey if we are going to subsidize your economy and keep your country functioning then we want you to support us in return . '', 
  it is unfair to use illegal tactics like invested health scares to mess with ukrainian trade but still , ukraine 's issues are real and [ u/russiandynamo ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/russiandynamo ) has a point when he mentions them . 
  if this is true than why did this happen ? 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-tv-anchor-fired-coming-out-2013-8 there was no gay sex on krasovsky 's television show for adults . 
  all he did was say the he was gay and not a terrible person for it . 
  i agree - it does not . 
  the pussy riot singers were awful and trespassing . 
  had they been charged with trespassing it would have completely deserved it . 
  they were not engaged in the hooliganism motivated by religious hatred that got them a two-year jail sentence though , and they did not deserve that . 
  assuming that everything you said about the us and imf is 100 % true , that still does not excuse russians breaking russian laws and the russian constitution to target russians . 
  if anything , russians should be even more vigorous about protecting their system to defend against outsiders seeking to tear it apart . 
  i do n't see how charging pussy riot for hooliganism motivated by religious extremism is a `` tit '' for the tat of nato expansion . 
  pussy riot itself is terrible . 
  they do think that they are artists and follow a philosophy based on shock value as a means of shaking up society . 
  as part of this they have done some pretty shocking things . 
  screetchy singing cathedral of christ the saviour was just one effort to shock . 
  but they were n't charged with being shocking , or stupid , or not going to the hospital when in labor . 
  they were charged with hooliganism motivated by religious hatred when really all they did was annoying trespassing . 
  and they were n't hooligans motivated by religious hatred . 
  they were wannabe philosophers motivated by a desire to be shocking the same way they were when they held an equally screetchy mini-concert in the metro , or did that disgusting thing with a chicken . 
  the fact that they are awful was likely part of why they were chosen to be made a lesson - people like you would n't object as much as if a more `` normal '' opposition figure was targeted but the fact that anyone at all was made an example of could have a chilling effect on the increasing criticism and dissent at the time . 
  in order to get that inaccurate verdict the political forces corrupted the court and the church . 
  this does not hurt the us , the imf , or nato . 
  this hurts russians who need their russian laws , russian freedoms , russian institutions and even their russian orthodox church to be strong supports and protectors . 
  please stop comparing russia to saudi arabia as if that makes anything in russia ok . russia should hold itself to a higher standard than saudi arabia . 
  the vatican comparison is also not accurate . 
  pussy riot performers also did not `` break some crucifixes , shit there and other nasty stuffs '' - they just sung their screechy , politcal `` punk prayer '' and filmed it to make a video of the same . 
  you can see it [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=greblskpdwq ) . 
  a proper comparison would be to ask `` what would the vatican do if two women trespassed and yelled for fifteen seconds ? '', 
  that answer would not be `` charge them with hooliganism made by offending their religious feelings and jail them for two years . '', 
  we can know this as a fact - femen 's inna shevchenko recently did something far worse than just trespassing and yelling a political prayer - she ran topless at the vatican with criticism of the church painted on her body - and she was not given such a sentence . 
  my understanding of the pussy riot issue was less that it was less part of a policy in which the government sought to silence all critics and more that , at a time of growing criticism , the pussy riot performers , being so extreme , seemed like a good target to make an example of . 
  to my eyes , it does not appear that they got `` exact terms as written in the code '' because they were n't charged with the exact crime that they committed - trespassing . 
  instead the prosecutors trotted out witnesses to lie that the 15 seconds of pussy riot 's screeching gave them a religious type of ptsd in order to apply the hooliganism motivated by religious hatred charge that they were sentenced under . 
  i never liked pussy riot , but that case and verdict were very upsetting to me . 
  not only were they unjust for the defendants and a worrying sign about state opinions regarding a time of increasing criticism , it allowed for the courts to be corrupted - not through money , but through politics . 
  equally , if not more upsetting , it allowed the church to be corrupted and used as a political tool too . 
  although i do n't know the true secret facts of the case , politkovskaya probably was n't killed by the government . 
  i do n't doubt that putin et . 
  did not like her , but her death caused them far more political pain than her reporting did . 
  some other critics were just as aggressive against the government and were not killed . 
  in contrast , her reporting caused far more pain for some of the criminals and fighters she investigated than her death did . 
  the government does quite a few bad things , but not every bad thing . 
  **  yes , homosexuality is legal in russia . 
  ** true . 
  russia is not saudi arabia and it is n't fair to paint the two countries with the same brush . 
  however , my concern about russia and gay rights though is not if things are as bad as they can be , but rather that russia appears to be moving backwards by adding vague restrictions that did n't exist before as part of a broader domestic policy campaign to shore up a so-called `` conservative base . '', 
  other moves of concern include the anti-blasphemy law . 
  this is unfair to those targeted , restricts constitutional freedoms and also concerns me on a pure politics/faith in leaderships ' capability levels as it gives the impression that the government is feeling weak and not responding effectively to that issue . 
  **  there is freedom of speech , guaranteed by the constitution ** in this respect i ask for your perspective on the difficulty many groups encounter in getting permits to publicly demonstrate . 
  even marches in favor of the right to march were targeted by authorities . 
  i also ask for your opinion on internet filtering challenges in general , the latest proposed law to restrict online efforts to organize public protests , very broad application of the anti-extremism law , very broadly applied hooliganism charges , and slander/libel/hurt feeling lawsuits and illegal attacks such as ddos and twitter/regular spam campaigns against opposition and critical sites , particularly during sensitive times in russia . 
  these issues are n't restricted just to the internet either - if free speech is so protected , how did ntv go from a private and often critical tv station to a state-owned propaganda outlet that shows fabrications like `` anatomy of a protest ? '', 
  when gusinsky fled the station could have been kept private and independent but instead gazprom bought it and made it what it is today . 
  **  also , russia does n't spies on its own citizens ** if that is so , how do you explain the sorms , the use of deep packet inspection to address internet filtering issues or the latest law , proposed last week , that requires isps and sites to record users ' activities and keep those recordings for six months after their last date of usage and the accompanying requirement that all sites that include social options and comments such as social media or forums be reported to the government ? 
  ** tl ; dr russia is in a better position than places like saudi arabia in so many ways and has so many great things about it , so i expect more of russia and hold the country to a higher standard . 
  i can see how that could be . 
  at this point i care little though . 
  what matters is less to me are the origins of the gesture and what matters more is that , when people use it now , they know about its perceived connections and still choose to use it . 
  i would n't use the hitler greeting even though it did n't originate with him , because i would expect viewers to interpret it as a hitler greeting . 
  i would find another way to represent what i wanted to say . 
  the same goes for the quenelle . 
  there are many ways to show disdain for authority without also showing prejudice and nastiness . 
  i suspect that flaunting the formal and social prohibitions on that prejudice and nastiness are part of the fun of the quenelle , but that only makes me think less of the people that use it . 
  there is a reason they chose hatred the jews , and not , say , child rape , as the line they wanted to cross . 
  one bothers them less than the other . 
  that 's a questionable legal issue . 
  slander is usually approached as a single entity thing - if you say that a particular person is a serial philanderer or that an organization is corrupt they can sue for slander and you have to prove that they are . 
  even really big collective cases like france 's `` trial of the century '' hinge on single yes or no issue - did kravchenko lie when he described the ussr 's prison camps system ? 
  witnesses were brought in who had been in the camps , and he won . 
  larger , more general statements about characteristics of entire groups are harder to address in a simple yes-or-no libel/slander court case ( what is the legal definition of money grubbing ? 
  parasitic ? 
  a jew ? 
  what is the legal standard for assessing all jews ' possessions of these traits ? ), 
  they are therefore more typically addressed through hate speech regulations or allowed to continue as free speech opinions . 
  it would interesting to try a slander case along the lines of `` prove that a significant portion of jews are money grubbing parasites '' or that `` most immigrants are lazy benefits seekers '' but i 'm not aware of it ever happening in real life .
