  there is a men 's day , and it is celebrated with as much fuss , but with less flowers and more chocolate , on february 23 in countries where women 's day is most celebrated . 
  i iike women 's day . 
  i is a nice way to thank all of the women in your life , not just romantic partners and mothers . 
  my only complaint is that it started a hundred years ago to promote women 's equality and now its mostly about flowers and `` appreciation . '', 
  there is also a men 's day you know , at least there is in eastern europe where women 's day is most celebrated - on february 23rd all men in your life have their day , although they get less flowers and more snacks . 
  switzerland may reduce the income of executives working in switzerland . 
  this law wo n't affect the majority of the `` super-rich '' who live in switzerland or who invest and bank there , as those people do not receive their primary income in switzerland . 
  you keep using that word . 
  i do not think it means what you think it means . 
  [ forced labor ] ( http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm ) . 
  you have a range of paid job choices , you are n't forced to do anything but have a job . 
  even that is n't forced - you can also choose to study . 
  it is n't total freedom of action , but it is n't [ forced labor ] ( http://www.ilo.org/global/topics/forced-labour/lang--en/index.htm ) either . 
  yes , but the time period is not forever , and many people either extend their studies or avoid service upon graduation - that part does n't seem too strict . 
  there is a wide range of jobs and you get paid . 
  you even get two weeks vacation . 
  it 's not exactly true forced labor . 
  forced military service when a country is n't under attack would be more questionable , but it is n't forced , there is the civil service option . 
  what is more , austria is a neutral country . 
  any military service choosers do not have to worry about the situation changing on them during their service . 
  i 'm austrian , and i 'm for it . 
  if you go to university you are exempt ( unless you want certain government jobs later ) . 
  only young school graduates go , and then they can choose for six months in the military or nine months in the civil service . 
  it can be a good introduction to working life straight out of school ( no months spent trying to find the first job 's work training and experience ) and independence for people who are still largely kids . 
  my slacker cousin was one such kid - he preferred games to university , but working nine months in an ambulance helped him grow up , change his priorities and do something on his own . 
  if you have the qualifications and inclination , there are some interesting jobs to get as well - a friend worked at a think tank , albeit in a junior position . 
  other people mentioned the social benefits as well - the military and civil service are the ones who come when there is a flood or fire or other emergency . 
  they work in ambulances , hospitals , community centers , etcetera . 
  some of those jobs can be replaced in the private sector , others really need to be centralized state operations to work . 
  my father points out an additional social benefit - he chose military service before going to university abroad , and he said that he felt that the military was a good place for creating a sense of national community ( austrians tend to like their regions ) . 
  his information is a little dated but the idea seems like it could still be valid . 
  i do think that it is silly for women to be exempt - there are some specific jobs requiring great physical strength then only people who can meet the requirements should do them , but there is a lot that women can do , and should . 
  i first saw it on an uzbek site . 
  there is some international coverage , however , including this article : [ uzbek dictator 's daughter lines up depardieu for starring film role ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/uzbek-dictators-daughter-lines-up-depardieu-for-starring-film-role-8274479.html ) the same article also mentions depardieu 's previous roles as a paid supporter for chechen strongman ramzan kadyrov ( [ himself quite the killer ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ramzan_kadyrov#accusations_of_human_rights_abuses ) ) and as a paid member of the audience of [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv4ijhz2yio] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv4ijhz2yio ) .

  i 'm mad . 
  not about his moving - he can live where he likes . 
  i 'm mad at gerard depardieu agreeing to star in an uzbek film about the silk road . 
  the film is the latest effort by gulnara karimova , the sex trafficking , economy wrecking , social climbing daughter of [ uzbekistan 's despotic , boiling-prisoners-alive , kleptocrat president ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/islam_karimov#human_rights_and_press_freedom ) , to be famous . 
  she tried to be a fashion designer , but [ human rights watch ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2011/sep/12/new-york-fashion-week-cancellation ) got her disinvited from major shows . 
  she tried to be in `` society '' by sponsoring an aids benefit in cannes , but was chased out by ngos . 
  apparently elton john did n't appreciate [ reporters without borders calling to ask why he was associating with a woman at an aids charity who is more famous for running the corrupt business wing of a government that jails hiv awareness activists ] ( http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,459e6a502,459e6a592,4bf633bfc,0,rsf,,.html ) . 
  she tried to be a pop star , [ but her songs sucked ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3hlfix8qmu&amp;list=uu4oundk3n9dm2ksde6wz5zg&amp;index=1 ) , even the one [ that she sang with depardieu ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ikqrbjz1rk ) ( something that did n't stop the uzbek press from reporting that she was on the american charts and that her songs were `` played more than 100 times in american nightclubs '' ) . 
  she made a half-hearted stab at being a sex symbol , [ tweeting photos of herself doing yoga ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2237210/daughter-uzbekistans-brutal-dictator-tweets-images-intense-yoga-session-havent-gone-home-country.html ) , but they were badly received in her conservative home country and made no impact anywhere else . 
  now she wants to make films and paid gerard depardieu some insane amount to give her film some legitimacy . 
  he cares soooo much about politics at home but has no problem collaborating with an international criminal and uzbekistan 's [ `` most hated person '' ] ( http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/40515 ) . 
  seriously , when i was there people could n't stop talking about how much they hate her . 
  i 'd get in a taxi and boom , suddenly were talking about her latest corporate theft or her prostitutes in her nightclubs , clubs which happened to be the only clubs in tashkent allowed open late . 
  even the russian government , famous for being able to work with anyone able to make a deal , decided that she is too bad to work with , after she [ ~ ~ stole ~ ~ took over mobile phone assets in uzbekistan owned by russian businesses ] ( http://www.rferl.org/content/authorities-seize-gulnara-karimovas-moscow-apartment/24759226.html ) . 
  in general i agree , but the deliberate protection of just two dominant cheese companies makes me uncomfortable . 
  bismillah is `` in the name of god . '', 
  there are a lot of god phrases in arabic . 
  my favorite arabic cheesy pickup line : `` when i first saw you , i thought mashallah !, 
  but then i thought , inshallah . '', 
  actually , there is a god phrase for that in arabic . 
  it is mashallah . 
  as in : mashallah becky , look at her butt !, 
  literally the phrase means god willed it , but it is used in such contexts to mean oh my god ( omg , look at the wondrous butt that god willed to exist ! ), 
  totally works . 
  i 'm concerned about isis or other radical groups , but i expect the bigger problem ( in terms of numbers anyway ) is economic migrants coming at s time when there already are so many migrant requiring resources . 
  coming as a tunisian or a jordanian palestinian is hard . 
  if you can get in to europe , there is a good chance that you will be denied asylum and be sent home . 
  if you can get a syrian passport and claim to be a refugee , it becomes a lot easier to get permanent residency . 
  and the dubai legal system is all kinds of messed up . 
  but they did ask them to change . 
  they did n't ask them to give up all of their culture , but the u.s. expects all immigrants to buy into a certain set of accepted values and follow all us laws ( including family law and those preserving the rights of the individual ) . 
  beyond that , it is true and a good thing about america that once can worship or eat or live as one likes and still be american . 
  austria and hungary had been ruled by the same people for centuries before that . 
  there were many austrians in hungary and vice versa . 
  there were cultural , political and family ties . 
  the elites were even more interconnected . 
  there were hard feeling and even the aforementioned rebellion but the countries were in a much liner lasting and tighter relationship than france and syria were for the brief time the former controlled the latter . 
  a requested mandate does n't make the affected region part of the republic . 
  there are 115 prisoners in guantanamo bay . 
  a total of 775 people were brought there . 
  never tens of thousands . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_guantanamo_bay_detainees though there were likely some more prisoners in some other sites in afghanistan and iraq . 
  you are definitely right about that - emigrants being more nationalist and blindly emotional is a well-established phenomenon throughout the world and history . 
  support for a certain idea or narrative becomes tied up with self identity and the emigrant is detached from the actual experiences and developments . 
  there may have been some on r/newzealand . 
  a recent thread had a few posters with very strong opinions about self determination in crimea and events in ukraine for the average participant in a discussion about kiwi milk exports . 
  they did n't use the bs health restrictions that they have in the past . 
  the government flat out banned food imports from certain countries as their version of retaliatory sanctions . 
  the only health argument is that the authorities say that since the original origin of the food was hidden , it is impossible to know it was really handled according to food safety regulations . 
  they could test it , but that would be time consuming and have costs and they did n't . 
  instead they destroyed it , and some poor people got it from a dirty pile instead of many poor people getting it from a clean share house . 
  they are n't interested because they think they already know the truth , and that outside sources are lying about russia to take russia down . 
  or at least are no more trustworthy than the domestic sources . 
  rt would announce that , something that big they could n't avoid . 
  they would do their best to put a `` it 's all russophobia '' spin on it , but if enough evidence were available form the un , people would be interested enough to seek it out . 
  that should happen . 
  it likely wo n't , but it absolutely should . 
  in the mean time , the fact that one group of people were n't identified and escaped scot free does n't mean that all others who shoot down planes should never be identified and punished , any more than the fact that a murderer was never caught means that i should n't face justice if i kill someone . 
  even if i only killed them because i thought they were someone else and did n't confirm because connecting to the systems that could confirm for me would be an admission of where i got my weapon . 
  political points . 
  by vetoing an investigation , russia is implicitly admitting guilt and countries like malaysia and the netherlands can look like they are trying for their home constituencies without risking much . 
  but many russians believe the confusing denials issued domestically . 
  puncturing so huge a lie with evidence would go a long way to changing the acceptance of lies at home .
