  i tried to use a different headline and it was removed for `` editorialising the headline '' . 
  see the original submission i linked to . 
  a bit of both in a way . 
  the party itself and the program has very little to do with national socialism . 
  however because they are the only right leaning party they attract some nazis in both their voter base as well as some of their members . 
  the extreme cases were usually let go from the party but it took them some time to do so . 
  yeah , the headline is crap . 
  their actual policies are not nearly as far right as people make it out to be . 
   but 300 + pages is even for me a bit much , does anybody know if there is a condensed version of about 10 pages or so that has the highlights so that i can form an opinion about it ? 
  it 's the same as all the others . 
  there are abridged overviews on wikipedia about the topic in itself . 
  non editiorialized title this time . 
  same title as original source . 
  if you want more actual information about the results see the [ previous submission ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mli57/upper_austria_local_election_results_%c3%b6vp_363_sp%c3%b6/ ) . 
  tell me exactly how this should be submitted with the original title ? 
  - a ) the title is not even english - b ) the title makes no sense translated for an international audience do you really want me to submit source with that title but worse overview just to fit ? 
  / / edit : also the original title for the news on orf.at btw is ( translated to english ) : `` election in upper austria : fpoe took the `` enraged citizen '' - \u201e anger `` as election motive for fpoe '' . 
  it does not really matter . 
  germany ranks very bad in public satisfaction in their railway system on a number of factors , behind rail networks of similar size . 
  can be found in the same report . 
   thats not really a fair comparison . 
  germany by far the biggest train railway system . 
  it 's not hard to be on time if most smaller cities are not connected to trains . 
  and yet , germany fails more on long distance trains than short one . 
  what does that say exactly about connections to small cities ? 
  this is a resubmission because the previous one ( [ state elections in upper austria : nationalistic fp\u00d6 gains 31 % ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3ml279/state_elections_in_upper_austria_nationalistic/ ) ) was removed by moderators due to editorializing the title . 
  this one now contains the results of the first three parties in the title and the comment to give it context is literally what has been said by voter analysis on national television , as well as the agreed upon reasoning for these results by all participating parties . 
  * voter turnout was 81,7 % which is a bit higher than usual * previous coalition was green + oevp , but this can not work any more because oevp lost too much * greens will probably not play a role now even though they gained a bit . 
  how the parties are roughly structured on a political spectrum ( simplistic ) : kpoe - greens - spoe - neos - oevp - fpoe what they stand for basically : * kpoe : the communists * greens : the traditional green party * spoe : social democrats * oevp : conservatives ( christian ) people party * noes : neo liberal party * fpoe : conservative and nationalistic right of center party possible coalitions going forward : * oevp + fpoe : likely * oevp + spoe : quite unlikely * spoe + fpoe : very unlikely, 
  i did n't even submit the link . 
  i sent the mod mail before i saw a flaired modpost . 
  it 's actually worse than you make it out to be in your edit . 
  look at the punctuality statistics : http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/rail/market/doc/com ( 2014 ) 353 ___ part_2 ___ en.pdf in long distance trains only poland and lithuania have worse performance than germany . 
  in short distance trains you are barely in the first half . 
  looks like this submission was delisted by a moderator for some reason . 
  not sure if this update will be picked up now , but here it goes anyways . 
  * movement of the votes over time : https://twitter.com/arminwolf/status/648151939088273408 * voter turnout was 81,7 % which is a bit higher than usual * previous coalition was green + oevp , but this can not work any more because oevp lost too much , greens will probably not play a role now even though they gained a bit . 
  yeah , see my ninja edit . 
  when i moved the bars earlier it was less than that . 
  there is only one that is likely : oevp + fpoe . 
  spoe does not go into coalition with the fpoe and even if , they would just barely make 50 % . 
  they did change their opinion just recently but if they do that now , they will lose the viennese elections even more and oevp + spoe is just barely making it over the 50 % as well and i do n't think that it 's likely they want to make a coalition of losers . 
  / / edit : it wiggled around a bit since i looked at it last , looks like oevp + spoe is now quite a bit above 50 % . 
   is this likely to have implications in relation to the policies of other austrian parties ? 
  the ruling parties tried to exclude the fpoe as much as possible in the past which led to the situation that the fpoe has become stronger and stronger over the years , yet they did not contribute in any meaningful way in the government . 
  there have been some local exceptions and there was the period where austria was sanctioned where the fpoe played a role however . 
  now the roof is on fire insofar as that accepting the fpoe now seems necessary because that will be the only way to actually keep them from harming the country . 
  the problem is actually not that they are particularly extreme , but that they have populist ideas of how to run the country that do not help anyone . 
  i do n't think that the actions of the leading parties however will significantly change for various different reasons . 
  biggest one is that they think they can keep losing local elections and by the time the national elections come up , the problem will have passed . 
  it was the only party that opposed the immigration policies currently enacted and they have for a long time . 
  so no surprise . 
  the only thing that really is a surprise is that the greens did not lose points and that the democrats did not lose more . 
  austria : unlike what people think of us , we actually exist / / edit : no upvotes , no other comments about austria and our election results were just delisted from the subreddit . 
  i like to think we 're a bit more relevant than that !, 
  sample size one year ? 
  you have no idea how many will stay . 
  look at past immigration waves and they were followed by people leaving in droves . 
  you need more than the 230.000 * per year each year * until 2070 . 
  this is unlikely . 
  are we talking about different topics ? 
  that page itself is predicting a decrease of the population at w2 and that 's at an immigration rate of 230.000 persons per year which is above what germany can realistically sustain for 50 years and has never done . 
  currently the over year average is 200.000 . 
  i want to see a source for germany expecting an above 230.000 people net immigration over that period of time . 
   the reality in the netherlands is similar . 
  heavily depends on where you are . 
  however even in the most extreme parts of the netherlands there are some sundays where stores have open . 
   this had nothing to do with the sanctions though ? 
  the annexation of crimea was in 2014 , we had 1.6 % growth that year . 
  we will likely see 1.8 % this year . 
  the russian sanctions did not start until end of 2014 . 
  the agricultural sections started in fall of 2014 . 
  actual enforcement was sloppy for some time and did not really take off until spring this year . 
   the uk could raise the taxes , they are n't however . 
  yes , it is cheaper in the first place , but as you said , private insurances , they just relocate the payments . 
  not sure how that is related . 
  germany 's healthcare system costs a lot more money * already * . 
  the only reason the nhs is controversial is because the uk tries hard to * not * become the german healthcare system where private companies intermingle with the nhs . 
  if anything germany is already where some people want to see the nhs but the political left tries to prevent this for what i think are pretty good reasons . 
  bupa + nhs contributions are lower than the cost of government healthcare in germany for almost all earners . 
   what part of dealing with the crisis are you criticizing by the way ? 
  this topic in it 's entirety is much larger than fits into a reddit comment . 
  however in this scope of this discussion germany with a very large exposure to russia chose to destroy years of development of corporate relationships between germany and russia . 
  other countries like the uk and the us did n't even execute the sanctions to the extend of germany and never had as much exposure to begin with . 
  germany should have been on the barricades and come to different solutions than what was ultimately executed . 
  again , that 's not just germany 's problem but it is a problem germany now will have to deal with . 
   what do the ez finance ministers have to do with this ? 
  the last time i checked , this decision was up to the ecb and not the euro group . 
  with regards to the ecb , the german part of it was the only one that voted against it . 
  the reason the finance ministers matter is because the policy of the ecb is ultimately set to match what the individual fiscal policies of the countries look like . 
   we exceed w2 however . 
  [ ... ] the `` biggest immigration imaginable '' scenario - 230,000 net migration per year . 
  citation needed please . 
  what is w2 ? 
   there are actually quite a few countries with this policy . 
  switzerland , austria , germany , norway and now apparently hungary . 
  not that many . 
   the nhs has a history of being chronically underfunded while lacking capacity . 
  the nhs reportedly has the longest waiting times of all european health systems . 
  social services are underfunded everywhere .
