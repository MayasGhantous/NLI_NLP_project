   your finmin , schauble continues to use the term `` troika '' in press conferences , knowing that this is very sensitive for the greek people and government . 
  first of all his name is schaeuble , not schauble . 
  secondly where does he do that ? 
  in fact , i remember how everybody was laughing that troika was replaced with `` institutions '' in press conferences now . 
  but anyways , how is this in any way relevant to anything . 
  i 'm not sympathizing with him , just pointing out the situation . 
   and to think felix baumgartner is threatening to leave for switzerland because taxes in austria are `` unbearable '' . 
  if we go by this map , he 's in for a whopping 5 % drop in income tax . 
  that 's not why he left , but because the state does not consider him a sportsman . 
   but hey , if carinthia gets `` cut off '' maybe we can annex it and punish it for voting the other way back in 1920 . 
  ( i 'm kidding on this one ) let 's do some trading . 
  styria wants some parts back , we can give the klagenfurt area + bank to slovenia . 
  nobody wants them anyways :p, 
  you asked why it 's considered bad , you chose to ignore or invalidate all my arguments based on opinion or by claiming my arguments to be opinionated . 
  i do n't think this discussion is not going anywhere . 
  it was reported . 
  for instance here : http://www.oe24.at/oesterreich/chronik/praterstern-sex-attacke-im-whiskey-rausch/232952736 however reports were modified afterwards to remove that information because it was probably too easy to pinpoint the person . 
  if only there were people who study this . 
  not sure how this can be blamed on capitalism . 
  communism would suffer from the same problem with those population changes . 
   creditcard and support in english boil down to preference and honestly i could n't give a shit about those things . 
  preference only applies if you can chose something . 
  by refusing cards you do not give people a choice . 
  cash payments are completely inappropriate for international travellers let alone business travellers with company cards . 
  if you do not give a shit about those things then that 's great for you , but there are a lot of people that care an awful lot about this . 
   same with driver rating and not trusting your driver . 
  i on the other hand do n't trust some american company with my data . 
  i trust large companies generally a lot more to handle my personal data properly than a taxi driver . 
  case in point : the only time my credit card was misused was by a taxi driver who tried a cnp payment with my card . 
   surge charges are completely incompatible with uberx anyway because unlike uberpop there is no freely scaleable pool of drivers and cars . 
  again , uberpop is not a thing in most places of the world . 
  why uberx would not support surge charges makes no sense because the pool is by no means constant . 
  drivers do not drive the entirety of the day or week and even if , it 's not just the drivers that scale , it 's also the customers . 
  if the system is surging then some people will not take the cab if they are not interested in paying for it right now and will instead drive when the surge ends . 
  that way people that absolutely need to go somewhere ( eg : plane , business meeting , date , etc. ), 
  will be able to get there in time . 
   now that 's not preferences but just a bunch of lies . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  * ** users rate drivers ** : for no taxi company in vienna can you rate drivers and the quality is absolutely random . 
  that is a fact . 
  * ** cars and credit cards ** : as far as i 'm aware there is no law in vienna/austria that requires card payments and if there is , then some taxis are in violation of it . 
  i was twice in a taxi that did not accept a credit card and i have heard the same story countless of times from partners . 
  you specifically have to ensure you order a taxi that you can pay by card . 
  that is a fact . 
  * ** receipts by mail ** : there is no taxi company which gives you receipts automatically by email . 
  i used 31300 last year per app and also that way i did not receive a mail . 
  it 's like the app does not even track the journey . 
  the only app that does something like this is mytaxi which has similar issues as uber for you i suppose . 
  * ** have no idea if the taxi takes the right route ** . 
  this as well is a fact and not a lie . 
  there are no taxi apps in vienna that show you the route the driver is supposed to take . 
  * ** customer support ** : have you ever used uber or any of the support of viennese taxi companies ? 
  half the ones in vienna struggle with basic english for a start . 
  uber support is international , speaks multiple languages and is integrated into the general app and payment experience . 
  i 'm not sure if you have actually tried it yet if you think they are not doing a good job with it ? 
  * ** surge charges ** : again , this is a fact . 
  taxi concessions in austria disallow surge charges . 
  these are not `` a bunch of lies '' . 
  they are facts . 
   preferences sure , i suppose for the people that have preference in low quality drivers , cars that are cash only , do not provide apps or not apps for tourists , do not give receipts or take too long to do it , go random routes , provide terrible customer support and are basically unavailable if there is high demand then viennese taxis are the way to go . 
  i take from this you are out of arguments and as such decided to just discredit the other party of the discussion ? 
  how very nice of you . 
   on what basis do you say that when you do n't even know what it takes to run a taxi in austria . 
  because i use taxis and uber a lot , and so do my business partners and friends . 
  i do not need to know how a taxi company works to be able to judge it as a customer . 
   `` but my taxi medallions '' yeah were are not in new york who said anything about taxi medallions ? 
  do n't put words into my mouth . 
   but if you want to buy into the propaganda of how some american venture capital driven start up that 's takes way more of the revenue from the drivers than domestic phone centrals is somehow more efficient i guess it ca n't be helped . 
  some people just love to gargle with koolaid . 
  i do n't know what your problem with uber is but from a user perspective it 's insanely superior and you can not do uber as a taxi company in austria . 
  since rufzentralen love the situation they are in they would also not want this changed . 
  here is why uber is significantly better than a viennese taxi : * users rate drivers . 
  rude and useless drivers are removed from the platform . 
  you can not even complain about drivers online without writing a mail to some obscure mail address you can find on a * german only website * for the taxi companies and you need the driver 's number . 
  ridiculous . 
  * all cars take credit cards and i do n't even need to argue about that . 
  it charges automatically and i do n't even need to talk to the driver . 
  it 's significantly faster and more convenient . 
  * i can use the app in all places where uber operates . 
  this is huge for business travelling . 
  you can not even install the austrian taxi apps on non austrian phones because whoever wrote them does not submit them to international app stores . 
  ask a foreigner about their experience with viennese taxies compared to uber . 
  * the receipts automatically arrive and you do n't have to ask for them . 
  even if you get them , someone just gives you a badly handwritten one and no printout . 
  * you have no idea if the taxi takes the right route whereas with uber you do . 
  also uber knows where to go to because you can punch the address in . 
  * customer support with uber is amazing . 
  if something is wrong just reply to it . 
  * uber has surge charges which is * amazing * . 
  in vienna you ca n't get a taxi when weather is bad , yet you can always get an uber if you are willing to pay premium . 
  sure . 
  sit on your high horse and argue how i do n't know what i 'm talking about because i do n't know anything about taxi companies but i know where my money goes when i have a choice . 
  i wish a european company would have started uber and not an american one . 
  however our environment is horrible for startups here ( particularly in austria ) so that 's just way too unlikely to happen . 
   you are obviously clueless . 
  why am i clueless , can you elaborate ? 
  what exactly is wrong about the statement `` uber is more innovative than viennese taxi companies '' ? 
  shy should i ? 
  i have no interest in running a taxi business and i find the entire situation of taxi concessions ridiculous and something that we should get rid of and not encourage further . 
  dinosaurs should die out and make room for more innovative services .
