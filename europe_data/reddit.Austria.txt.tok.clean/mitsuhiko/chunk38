  i regularly travel between hermagor and vienna . 
  the distance without any breaks and detours is 410 kilometers . 
  there are also just no good electric cars . 
  i looked around six months ago when i bought a car and the only halfway decent option is the model s. and the range of it is just not high enough that it would work for me . 
  that does n't happen from one day to another . 
  the entire fleet emission concept is stupid . 
  there are companies here that buy useless electric vehicles to put it into their fleet that nobody drives to bring down the fleet emissions . 
  same concept . 
  it 's a shitty regulation in the first place . 
  people have a choice to buy greener cars but they will not , so the manufacturer has a worse emission profile . 
  does not matter , because without that car they would fail emission targets for their fleet in the eu . 
  so even if it 's expensive , it 's necessary for them . 
  it 's not even kia 's fault . 
  the demand for electric vehicles in the eu is not high enough yet . 
  we do n't have statistics on income of cities but on municipalities and they are really hard to compare . 
  for instance the poorest muncipality used to be [ tr\u00f6ssing ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/tr%c3%b6ssing ) with less than 600 eur/month per head . 
  however there were only 270 people living there in 2013 and because there are so few people , the statistics are useless because you just need more pupils than working people there and that will skew the statistic greatly . 
  if you look at the entire states within austria ( of which there are 9 ) the richest is vorarlberg with 24.5 k eur / person a year and the poorest is carinthia with 21.2 k eur / person . 
  the latter is suffering from the development of the local development and towns shrinking because people move into the two large cities : villach and klagenfurt . 
  so i can give you some representative pictures from hermagor which is where i was grew up . 
  a local city with ~ 3000 people living there which is one of the places in austria which shrink the most : * [ valley ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/blick_auf_hermagor1.jpg/2560px-blick_auf_hermagor1.jpg ) * [ old city ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/hermagor_stadtansicht_01.jpg/1280px-hermagor_stadtansicht_01.jpg ) * [ traditions ] ( http://www.bundesheer.at/pool/img/hermagor2005_tanz.jpg ) * [ city from above ] ( https://haasihermagor.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/hermagor.jpg ) the per head a person in hermagor has on average ~ 15.000 eur/year for his disposal . 
  the austrian average is 22.000 eur/year . 
  i 'm not so sure how many of you remember [ this story ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3213858/migrant-death-toll-chicken-meat-truck-rises-70.html ) but austrian and hungarian police managed to identify 69 out of 71 of the dead . 
  including in those numbers are three families . 
  five people are in custody for it and the prosecution is being prepared . 
  i 'm quite surprised they managed to identify the victims , must have been a pretty dire and sad process . 
  i had no idea . 
  i was listening to the audio recording and i could not make out a single word . 
  what was what ? 
  with a muezzin  the hagia sophia is a political thing and last time the pope mentioned the armenian genocide they brought up conversion into a mosque again : http://www.ibtimes.com/hagia-sophia-mosque-conversion-turkey-pope-backlash-could-open-historic-church-muslim-1885464, 
  i honestly wonder what a russian speaking pilot is supposed to make out of this . 
  is the expectation that you speak turkish when you fly there ? 
  i thought air traffic messages were supposed to be english . 
  / / edit : i just listened in a few seconds on the video and i thought they were speaking turkish . 
  it sounded neither russian nor english to me . 
  pretty sure no pieces fall offan aircraft if you fo n't shoot at it . 
  austria has above 8 % muslim population , so doubtful . 
  and guns , 
  the problem with that is that there are just so many charities that they can impossibly overlook and monitor them all . 
  there are currently more than 180.000 registered charities in the uk totalling 70 billion pound in income . 
   what ? 
  you 're talking about childline and other children 's charities ? 
  everybody does it . 
  this is one from unicef : http://cemertur.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/unicefs-children-of-syria-winter-crisis-appeal-ad-london-underground-carriage-december-2012.jpg  how else are you supposed to raise money for a charity without making people think about what they do n't know about or what they chose to ignore ? 
  you have literally no oversight from these campaigns if they use the funds the way they say unless you know anything about the charity . 
  pretty sure a random non profit can hang up a poster there , at least there is no way to distinguish this as someone looking at the ad . 
  the question that is used to rank the `` generosity '' of nations is how much of the population donates not how much is given . 
   `` higher standards '' my arse . 
  i can only assume we have different opinions on what is acceptable advertising for charities and what is not . 
  i do not think the concept of using guilt of people on public transportation is the correct way to go about raising money . 
  / / edit : and this is by no means limited to just text ads . 
  i got calls in the uk to set up direct debits for charities for christ 's sake . 
  not surprised . 
  be on the london underground and you are guilt tripped into texting `` saveme '' to xxxx to `` protect me from being raped by my grandfather '' . 
  this sort of shit is not legal in many other countries and there are much higher standards on charities . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  even if you are married you need to explicitly be claim fatherhood when getting a birth certificate . 
  if he was born before you even need to issue a new birth certificate and fill out more paperwork if you want to do that . 
  ( i never adopted , but i 'm a father and i 'm aware of the procedures behind this ), 
   no but you can get written into the birth certificate . 
  i did not dispute that . 
  however why in god 's name would you do that for a fake marriage ? 
   there was a guy that used this loophole to become father of like a 100 kids from latin america . 
  his kids were able to life in germany with their mothers . 
  i really liked the idea . 
  that 's not how it works . 
  that story was for the most part a fake . 
   nope . 
  its the same in germany . 
  when you get written into the birth certificate you are the father genes be damned . 
  you do not get written into a birth certificate on marriage . 
   the nigerian man legally takes her child , being the legal father he is not the legal father but the legal guardian i assume . 
  pretty sure he can not take the child like that . 
  people still make jokes about jack unterweger and that was years ago :p, 
  that 's rich as individually rich . 
  salaries in austria are not that amazing . 
  austria is irrelevant and does not want to stand out . 
  it 's largely because we celebrate mediocrity on all levels . 
  * better not innovate , but at the same time also not lag behind the times . 
  * better never be number one , but somewhere in the top 10 would be okay . 
  * better not play a role in international politics , but always invite the big players to have their conferences and meetings in vienna . 
  * we 're not rich , but we insure the crap out of everything so whenever something happens people do n't care that much about it . 
  we only ever get in the news if something stupid and terrible happens . 
  if the swiss pension funds are bankrupt by 2025 then austria 's is already . 
   why unprocessed wheat though ? 
  more versatile , easier to store and process , holds longer , can be cleaned if it gets dirty . 
  what 's the point in sending flour ? 
  i only go out when i 'm out of the country . 
  fucking thing sucks . 
  69 % in austria :(, 
  yes , and it sucks bloody balls . 
  i can not wait for this shitty anti smoking law to finally come into effect . 
  i 'm pretty sure we 're the ashtray of europe . 
  yes ? 
  this was common in austria and germany too . 
  they are called `` r\u00fcbengeister '' . 
   [ tax ] obviously we pay more taxes , not sure where i said anything different ? 
  however i bet you it does not matter as much as you might think . 
  you can live on a lot less money in austria because of all the things you do not need to pay money for . 
   my point is that it 's easy to look at this one difference and say you want to live in austria ( the guy who started this comment chain ) .
