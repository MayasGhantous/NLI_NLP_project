  i do n't think anyone should have the right to complain about excessive noise for a multi million euro infrastructure project if he 's alone in his or her claim . 
   as long as the next complaint is pointing out a violation of the law what 's the problem with that ? 
  if some in austria think projects like these are going to slow due to existing law the logical step seems to be to campaign to change those laws , not complain about people pointing out violations of the law . 
  the problem is that nobody wants to remove these laws because it 's bad publicity . 
  the largest infrastructure projects in history which we all depend on nowadays were built by completely ignoring human lives . 
  i 'm not saying we should go back to this , but we need to properly balance it . 
  it 's much harder now to build a large infrastructure project due to all the extra laws in place to protect people . 
  that is going to cause us serious problems . 
   obviously they did n't . 
  noise complaints are n't `` he said she said '' situations . 
  actually they are . 
  there is no law that says construction has to be less than ndb . 
  instead noise is regulated by what law defines as reasonable . 
  generally the austrian law defines that construction noise is necessary and needs to be tolerated . 
   how did they torpedo the project ? 
  presumably they can still construct the tunnel , they just have to do so within the law limiting construction noise . 
  the project is going on for too long because critics use every weapon possible to try to hamper its progress ( useless environmental checks , noise complaints etc. ), 
  this is not in a densely populated area , it 's in the middle of nowhere . 
   you can do that e.g. 
  by erecting some sound insulating barrier around the construction site . 
  then they come with the next complaint . 
   that the constructors did n't foresee this textbook problem that every construction project anywhere near human habitation in the western world has to take into account just makes them incompetent bad planners . 
  pretty damn sure they did . 
  that was one somewhat legitimate claim between hordes of useless complaints . 
  infrastructure projects are necessary , especially on the countryside as more and more people move into the cities because the infrastructure works better there . 
  the fact that one person in a remote home can torpedo a infrastructure project legitimately does not mean that person is right but that the law needs modification . 
  there is a * huge * difference between belarus and north korea . 
   because it 's the least democratic country in europe ? 
  well , it does not even try to be . 
  if you cut off foreign relationships should be judged by other means than the form of government however . 
  from what i have noticed so far is that people in belarus are on average quite satisfied with the country . 
  which is why they are irritated . 
   belarus and kazakhstan . 
  they already signed the treaty . 
  lukashenko is playing with putin . 
  belarus signs nearly everything that russia brings on the table but then backs out at 80 % of the plan . 
  they agreed on a shared government many years ago and are technically a union state but the further implementation never happened . 
  belarus decided on adopting the russian ruble , then decided to peg it against the us dollar . 
  belarus did not accept any of the russian annexed or controlled areas ( neither abkhazia nor south ossetia nor russian crimea ) . 
  belarus is an interesting country because it 's relatively independent from both russia and europe . 
  from europe not really by choice though . 
  i know the slang , but the currency would have been interesting , 
   it wo n't be allowed in any european country because of terrible passive security . 
  driver has nothing but glass in front of him , guess what will happen if the tram hits a car ? 
  the shape also guarantees any object wo n't be pushed aside , but instead pushed down under the wheels . 
  pretty sure the security for the driver is quite high . 
  first of all a car ( if it would be hit ) would hit below the driver . 
  secondly this tram has a lot less glass in the front than most modern european tram designs . 
  in regards to the shape of the tram : given that it will be sold to europe as well you can bet your ass off , that it will pass road regulations here . 
  austria : oh god . 
  what did we do this time . 
  austria generally only is in the news for drag queens , right wing parties or crazy murderers . 
  sometimes because mozart got n % 10 = = 0 years old . 
  i think the country is just really boring that very few things are internationally noteworthy . 
  what currency are `` bucks '' ? 
  from duesseldorf to sydney you can fly for 720 eur . 
  from paris there are flights for 600eur . 
  good that the uk is still part of the eu then because it 's not the tallest building in europe . 
   sadly class divide is visible there :( completely different from say ... living in the uk maybe . 
  someone still paid for it . 
  sex definitely . 
  the drugs that should be included of the gdp are seized drugs and as such property of the government and can be accounted for . 
  it is taxed and measured in a bunch of countries . 
  let the lawsuits begin . 
  negotiations ? 
  what do you mean by that ? 
  why no austria :'(, 
   let 's see if he will be able to revive the south stream project . 
  the present government is standing on its last leg , and it would be ridiculous if it were able to cause any more damage before its resignation . 
  south stream will happen . 
  there is too much interest in it and bulgaria would have already signed it if it was not for some intervention by the eu .

  generally always stays open in the background . 
   ** what is your favorite/least favorite thing about r/europe and what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  ** * favorite thing * : it 's a good place on reddit where you can get impressions of how different countries in the union are doing . 
  it 's fun and interesting to read , even if it 's biased . 
  i would say the * least favorite thing * about it is that people get a bit too attached with their countries on here . 
  sometimes discussions detail into `` my country / your country '' flamewars . 
   ** what would make you a good moderator ? 
  ** i think i would fit the subreddit here in staying balanced because i 'm living in more than on eu country , married to a non eu citizen and as such quite interested in the european union and the legalese that surrounds it . 
  i have a high interest in this community and the credentials to prove that i can manage a herd of redditors . 
  please qualify what exactly you mean with `` you are just a splinter in the ass of european values '' . 
  what are european values and how are we not following them ? 
  it 's wrong . 
  el is for the language , not for the country . 
  what is that supposed to mean ? 
  the internal numbers for both austria and germany are higher but they include people that are in state mandated education programs for instance . 
  i do n't even know what to make from your comment . 
  what has the ussr to do with the rf ? 
  austria has active business relationships with russia for a long time and it 's in the interest of the country to continue this .
