  there are countries entering the european union ( and already did ) which have corruption problems on their own . 
  if it would not be for american foreign policy interests a closer relationship with russia would have happened a long time ago . 
  russia would be a perfect partner for europe . 
  welcome  for moving there are lots of companies but you might have to contact them to get a quote . 
  the prices primarily depend on the distance i believe . 
  generally google and asking should work . 
  the austrian moving companies are crazy expensive unfortunately . 
  it 's would have been based on very similar principles . 
  the base of the law was very modern ( unchanged in modern day austria ) and it have enough independence to the counties within it . 
  how would it not have been ? 
  i think it 's a topic better not discussed . 
  there are lots of people even today that want the monarchy back . 
  please strike in germany . 
  please . 
  good for you then i guess . 
  from what i can see from personal experience the new uk visa process has definitely played a role in people not getting hired . 
   honestly , sorting a work visa is something my hr team do in a matter of hours . 
  it really does n't matter . 
  and how do you do this with the current quota system ? 
  just wanted to clear up any confusion , 
  not sure if you missed the last years since end of ww2 about austria 's history but austria is the country it is today is where it is , because it has good relationships with russia . 
  best buddies . 
  badly . 
  this one is way better . 
  in english : ** leitl ** : yes , 1914 , mister president putin , a part of ukraine was part of austria . 
  ** putin ** : what does that mean ? 
  what suggestions do you have ? 
  ** leitl ** : that means , ... that ukraine - today - 100 years later ... ** putin ** : i am afraid to hear what you are going to say next . 
  true , but even 4 weeks is too long of a break by that argument . 
  i think this is not particularly interesting information because the holiday layout is different for different countries . 
  total holiday time would be more interesting . 
  well . 
  there are definitely some right wing groups from different countries that go along well . 
  a good example is the identitaerian movement . 
  even most right wing parties are best friends . 
  just not the named . 
   stop this whataboutism . 
  this is about russia not the us . 
  how is this whataboutism ? 
  the whole discussion would not be happening if it was not for significant interest by americans for it to happen . 
  the european union would more than benefit from friendly relationships with russia instead of making it their enemy . 
  austria as a country has long running relationships with russia and cis countries , we have a lot of investment into that area and lots of cultural relations as well . 
  so you are going to ignore all of that because the line of the us and eu is that russia is the enemy ? 
  i welcome you to form your own opinion of the country first before you repeat whatever you read on reddit . 
   afghanistan was ravaged by terrorism under the ussr until they just decided to fuck it and just left them to rot . 
  the soviets left when the ussr fell . 
   your admiration of the ussr is disgusting . 
  not sure how you get the idea that i admire the ussr ? 
  you can probably accuse me of a whole bunch of things but definitely not admiration of the ussr . 
   edit : you 're russian . 
  figures . 
  you complain about my style of discourse and then you attempt to discredit me in the discussion about my inferred country of origin . 
  joke 's on you , i 'm austrian . 
  russia does significantly less warmongering than the us . 
  where do you draw the line . 
  why is the us a country tht should be supported in war without questioning but an energy agreement with russia is a controversial topic ? 
  on an aside : the russians ' way of managing countries has generally resulted in much nore stable governments than the americans ' . 
  compare afghanistan under the ussr and afghanistan under the us . 
  gender is not irrelevant though . 
  russians have a strong gender identity and always had . 
  there is not implicit assumption that a women would not be good in management ( if anything it 's the other way round ) but there are lots if professions a man or a woman would generally not pick because of gender reasons . 
  in my mind russia has a much more honest and direct approach to that . 
  feminism never really happened there . 
  you still have great gender inbalance in certain sectors but nobody gives a fuck . 
  the inbalance largely exists because people are have certain preferences and they naturally just stick . 
  ( also i would associate russian women with more intelligent and level headed on average than russian men . ), 
  the united states of austria . 
  maybe we can have them this time around . 
  i think it 's good . 
  we do n't need another cold war , economic relationships help to keep the situation relaxed . 
  there are some more pictures collected by der standard : http://derstandard.at/2000002251782/heftiger-hagelsturm-in-kaernten, 
  i have never seen them with a trailer . 
  in russia they are usually single trams . 
  not at all . 
  i would never attack anyone for wanting to emigrate . 
  i did it myself . 
  but i planned it carefully and did not depend on social security in the process of doing it . 
  sure , i have a huge advantage of being born in a nice european country and the world is indeed unfair . 
  but the world is not getting one bit fairer when people go to other countries to beg on the streets . 
  this neither helps the ones that live in the country nor the ones that beg . 
   no one here is talking about illegal immigration . 
  there is no need to beg if you are legally living there . 
   but as to your other point . 
  why someone should be forced to stay somewhere they do n't want to be ? 
  they should not be forced to stay where they do n't want to be . 
  i emigrated once , my wife emigrated . 
  but we never took that for granted , we work hard for it . 
   so what , if someone does n't want to work we should what , throw them in jail ? 
  that costs money too . 
  austria has support payments for people that do not work and so do most other european countries . 
   if i want the freedom to pursue my life and enjoy it the way i want to , then others should have that same freedom . 
  i do n't believe anyone should have unrestricted freedom including myself . 
  i know that such societies do not work . 
  well functioning societies have rules that people follow . 
  austria is a country of laws and paperwork and while i sometimes hate it with a passion , i understand why they exist and i 'm thankful of it in many ways . 
   it ca n't be all well and fine for me to do something that may cost society money ( eg mountain biking , kayaking , hang-gliding , risky activities that may cause a substantial hospital bill ) but then turn to the other person and say `` no , you ca n't do that , because it might cost me money . '', 
  i look at that as hypocritical and self serving ( no offense ) . 
  people that do extreme sports need to pay higher insurance costs . 
   someone comes along and says `` nope , i ai n't doin that . '', 
  if they are n't hurting anyone ( aside from themselves , in our opinion ) then who are we to say you ca n't do anything else ?
