  that 's absolutely not correct . 
  people that do not work cost you indirect a lot of money . 
  if they are dirty they can carry sicknesses , if they liter someone needs to pay for cleaning it up . 
  if they start doing drugs they cause problems for the social system as such , to doctors etc. 
  a modern society works because people work together . 
  but unfortunately the world does not work like that . 
  first of all it 's illegal to immigrate to most countries so you end up with either prison or deportation . 
  but even if it would work , it does not solve the actual problems of people emigrating from their countries because of those countries being non functional . 
  the only way to fix such countries is by their citizens since others wo n't go there . 
  if you are skilled you really do n't need to beg . 
  what about this : people should not immigrate because they are hoping for a better life elsewhere . 
  that just drags everybody down . 
  social welfare in austria only starts after a certain period of time . 
  you can not just immigrate into the country and be entitled to the social system . 
  i 'm assuming it 's the same in norway . 
  i support this . 
  countries like norway have strong welfare systems that make begging unnecessary . 
  big city does not have to mean loneliess . 
  three are many large cities where the culture encourages people to know their neighbors . 
   `` you can not decide how to talk to our prime minister ! '', 
  i do n't even ... / / edit : the german version is `` how our prime minister has to talk '' . 
  to add some context to this : \u043c\u0430\u0442 is it 's own level of profanity which does not really exist in other languages . 
  the use of it can be criminally prosecuted in russia . 
  my favorite version is \u043d\u0430 \u0445\u0443\u0439 , 
  the height of the bars is compared to average . 
  the data source is eurostat : http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/graph.do?tab=graph&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00114&amp;language=en&amp;toolbox=data highest eu countries are luxemburg , austria , netherlands . 
  get that smile out of your face . 
  nobody wants to talk to you . 
  other than that enjoy . 
  i think this one of the biggest problems with everything right now . 
  by stamping `` nazi '' or `` fascist '' on a topic you kill any sense of proper discourse which is dangerous because it only strengthens the extreme ones . 
  one ? 
  here is what 's embarrasing about austria : * people are ridiculously unfriendly on streets and proud of it * no proper smoking ban and they are proud of it * the current generation of people takes everything for granted and does not see how much the previous generations did to get there . 
  * broken parties that give the right wing sector too much strength and support . 
  what are we even discussing ? 
  i added some context to this sentence :  lebensrauch literally translates to : ` living smoke ' . 
  i was talking about the german word . 
  most words in other languages have a completely different meaning . 
  just ask a german what he thinks of '' \u00fcber '' compared to an american for instance . 
  that 's my point . 
  lebensraum is not a strong connotation . 
  it 's such a common word whereas `` hakenkreuz '' and `` swastika '' quite literally has no other meaning in the german language than a nazi symbol . 
   i hear that a lot and do n't know why people keep saying that . 
  sounds like you like what the standard is writing fits your world view and your world view is left of center . 
  nothing wrong with that . 
   being against the far right does n't make you less objective . 
  objectively the far right is bad . 
  objectively the far left is bad too . 
  where the bad parts of the left and right start is subject to debate . 
   so i guess that makes them seem biased ? 
  there is nothing inherently wrong with being biased , it just means that the paper has a line . 
  the standard is the paper of students , the green party and spoe . 
  that 's perfectly fine , but it 's biased . 
  i 'm not picking on the standard here . 
  die presse has exactly the same problem , just facing the other direction . 
   ps : of what antifa actions are you speaking ? 
  any ? 
  in the last few months alone we had more violence from the left wing than the right wing at demonstrations . 
  you might not agree with the ideas of the right and that 's fair enough , you do n't have to , but do n't keep lying to yourself that the more extreme left wing is not causing massive pain for police and taxpayer at the moment . 
   addition : lebensraum is a term from ww2 , translating to ` living space ' , used by the nazi regime . 
  lebensraum actually is a completely normal german word meaning habitat . 
  just because some nazis had ideology using that word does not mean that it 's still problematic . 
  center right bias . 
  der standard is not neutral . 
  it 's left wing and questionably so . 
  not matter how ridiculous antifa actions will become , der standard would never speak up against them . 
  a few seeks ago it became infamous for spreading the lie that police beat up a pregnant woman that lost her child at an anti right wing protest that escalated . 
  i would hardly call that neutral or unbiased . 
  that 's easy of you consider `` austria hungary '' . 
  the closest is the state broadcaster orf in parts because it 's paid by the state and has a law that guarantees independence . 
  but then the people put in place are always biased so it 's not really all that neutral either . 
  i think that part is vastly overstated . 
  since both germany and austria are in the european union they are essentially already one country and the world is still standing . 
  austria today is a very different austria than before the first world war . 
  when it was a monarchy ( or two ) it had many different nations and cultures in it . 
  today it 's predominantly german and does not have any ambitions of enlarging into other cultures . 
  instead austrians now invest as corporations into the former parts of the habsburg empire . 
  yep . 
  austria : we were n't victims of nazi germany but got a good deal for acting like we were one . 
  also we were a significant participant on every important global conflict ( not just the two world wars ) . 
  after the trouble . 
  the higher gas price is new . 
  well . 
  medvedev said it a few months ago . 
  well , the rebate was for the crimea lease . 
  now that crimea effectively is part of russia the rebate is gone . 
  albania would be the first predominantly islamic country in the european union . 
  why would austria do that ? 
  the turkish people leaving here would feel betrayed and it would cause diplomatic tensions which do n't help anyone . 
  i 'm not complaining , 
   what 's the point of savings , if you 're not spending that money ever to buy something ? 
  you are not being taxed on the money you already saved , you are taxed on the interest you receive . 
  there is no vat on saving money but there is a tax on the money you get from interest ( kapitalertragsssteuer which is 25 % i believe ) . 
  vat is 20 % for most things and 10 % on some others . 
  let me shock you with some austrian taxes . 
  say you earn ** 3000 ** euro a month according to your agreement with your employer . 
  in austria you will be paid 12 months + 2 salaries extra to a total of 14 . 
  what you see from these 3000 euros is ** 1899 ** euro per month . 
  ** you ** are effectively paying ** ~ 37 % ** taxes ( at this tax bracket ) which is not at all the highest . 
  this can get all the way up to 50 % .
