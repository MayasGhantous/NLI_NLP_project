  it 's not just that . 
  you also pay ** 20 % ** vat on top of nearly all the things you buy . 
  but that 's not the end of it . 
  when you are paid 3000 euro a month , on top of your salary your employer needs to pay money . 
  a lot . 
  for the 3000 euro you get ( of which you then pay 37 % taxes ) your employer needs to pay ** 4593 ** euro per month . 
  in that lump of sum is pension , child support money , insurance , highway taxes etc. 
  in other words : if you get ** 27502 ** euro at the end of the year ( after paying taxes ) your employer needs to pay ** 55119 ** euro which means the `` effective taxes '' are ** 50 % ** and at that point you 're not in the highest tax bracket yet , you 're in the 37 % tax bracket . 
  cool stuff huh ? 
  austria has vat on those, 
  in austria females are up from 3.3 % to 6 % over the last 15 years . 
  from 1980 foreigners in austrian prisons are up from 10 % to nearly 50 % . 
  that however largely has to do with the european union and increased immigration . 
  we would not gain anything from granting snowden asylum especially not because we have been best buddies with nsa since the end of the last world war . 
  in order to grant him asylum we go into very hot waters because of an established extradition agreement . 
  compare that to austria where we do n't even have a smoking ban yet . 
  i thought tatars and crimean tatars have nothing in common with each other ? 
  i think that 's perception bias . 
  my wife does not really speak german and she definitely does not have any problems getting daily things done in austria . 
  all bank employees speak english , even government officials in the most remote place will be able to get you to places . 
  i would however say that * especially * at universities you will have troubles with english as for whatever reason lots of people take a pride in not speaking english . 
  it got much , much better in the last 10 years . 
  you can get around with english oy without problems nowadays . 
  can mere mortals read the information released ? 
  i thought that 's only released to journalists . 
  might be interesting to ask thr guardian or another newspaper for confirmation to get a second source besides the herald scotland . 
  all of russia ? 
  sure . 
  but there are people in volgograd that want it renamed . 
  in any case the city wo n't be renamed because it causes too much overhead . 
  i know that , because my wife for instance was born in a city that got the name changed . 
  great fun when half the documents are now inconsistent with the naming . 
  before you all get ballistic : people living in volgograd have been wanting this for a long time . 
  the city is already called stalingrad a few times a year ( for instance on victory day ) . 
  i tend to agree but you are missing two things here : * public transportation in london is insanely expensive . 
  while public transport in vienna is something like 360 eur per year you pay something like 250 pounds for a zone 1-6 travelcard a * month * . 
  london is ridiculously expensive . 
  * unlike in austria where rents are very strictly regulated especially in regards to price changes , london seems to be the wild west . 
  the country needs a rent reform . 
  except russian sushi is awesome , 
  i doubt it has much more effect on normal humans than 0 % because banks can not move that interest to their customers or the customers would just withdraw their money . 
  that essentially puts pressure on the banks to lend out more money because they lose out on keeping it at the ecb . 
   why would france oppose scottish membership ? 
  marine le pen wants to destroy the eu going by her own words . 
  not letting scotland into the eu is a good way to accomplish this . 
  spain is most likely to say no because of catalonia . 
  france most likely no as well given their current eu politics . 
  if we would be in 1995 i might agree . 
  but given that less and less money goes into the agricultural sector now ( i think we 're at 40 % down from over 90 % ) that debate is becoming less and less interesting . 
  sure ; we should try to improve or fix it but the discussion is stuck somewhere on the 90ies argumentation wise . 
  and austria has been stating its wish in the past to set end to all rebates of which it 's own is included . 
  the union consists of other states than france as well and yet you only compare against france . 
  why should austria or the netherlands pay for uk 's discount ? 
  to give you an idea how agriculture in europe looks like : http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/rica/pdf/hc0301_income.pdf  seriously , man , you really believe that the uk should be subsidising french agriculture ? 
  i believe the eu should be subsidizing european agriculture . 
  i do not believe countries should pick and chose as they like because at that point we are no longer a union , we 're a group of individual countries trying to blame each other on every single problem . 
  not every country is equal and if we want to live and prosper together one country will have to pay for some things that another country does not have in return it will get something else . 
   but france receives much more from the budget . 
  that 's a ridiculous point to make because the mechanism about how much you get from the budget is the same for every country . 
  in fact because of the uk discount the french have to pay extra to make up for what you pay less . 
   you need to look at the net figures . 
  france and the uk are roughly equal . 
  how are you comparing numbers ? 
  if the discount would not exist numbers could be actually compared . 
  currently that 's absolutely impossible to do because of the imbalanced caused by it . 
  but yes : the uk should pay more than france and not less . 
  what you get back from the pot should not matter because that 's something that can be managed on a year by year basis . 
  for instance last year the uk was entitled to payments from the disaster fund but did not file for anything to come back . 
  as what you get back from the eu is not a percentage it makes no sense to discuss that in relation to the payments . 
   the uk 's net contribution is roughly the same as france , a country with a similar-sized economy to the uk 's . 
  in 2013 the uk paid 12.4 % of the budget , france did 16.7 % . 
  the uk 's share would have been 17,184 million pounds but the discount reduced it by 3,324 million . 
  note that the discount needs to be paid by other member states . 
  it 's not like the eu just has less budget that year . 
   that does n't lessen the fact that they give a lot more than the average european country . 
  sure , in absolutes the uk is the 4th top payer even with the discount . 
  it pays 0.25 % of it 's gdp to the eu . 
  but it 's ridiculous . 
  first of all we 're talking about tiny sums in the greater picture , secondly every other country in the eu needs to pay for the rabatte the uk has been granted . 
   the uk gives more money to the eu than it receives , and see that as either a waist , or feel that they are not appreciated enough for it ( mostly the first i think ) yet it pays a lot less than it should . 
  it has a special discount because they complained so much when they joined . 
  onmy because youbcan combine hartz with work . 
  in austria arbeitslosengeld stops when you have any kind of work . 
  they already had this for wood workers for two years now and people have not yet revolted . 
  there would be no point in doing thay because your only neighbor would be russia . 
  so you would entirely depend on it without having the benefits of being in the federation . 
  would would you hope to get ? 
  the latin alphabet ? 
  pretty sure tatarstan is one of the best known federal subjects of russia and one of the only ones that people usually know by name . 
  while the austrian result is terrible it has thankfully been way below expectation . 
  before the voting there were discussions if the fpoe can achieve the first place . 
  the union has an image problem . 
  not just in the uk . 
  antifascism in austria is this thing you are not allowed to touch . 
  one of the largest newspapers in austria ( der standard ) is center left and they have totally biased reporting about these kind of things . 
  but because it 's the newspaper that is read by most students you end up with the very bizarre situation where our leftwingers are more extreme than the rightwingers . 
  the ones in the right wing have to be very careful because association with national socialism is unconstitutional and there are severe penalties for it . 
  our flag is from 1230 . 
  the swiss one is from 1889 !!!, 
   people are scared of losing cultural primacy in their city .
