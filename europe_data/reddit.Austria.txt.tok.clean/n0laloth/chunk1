  i wonder who offered mitzi all that gravel ... 
  i love visiting the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary and the lot . 
  i always feel right at home ( often to the dismay of natives :d ) . 
  as someone not from vorarlberg i feel alienated in switzerland however . 
  but i think that 's mainly because of the vast difference in the language . 
  we love you too . 
  dear croatians , dear serbians , dear people from kosovo , bosnia and herzogovina could you all please get along ? 
  thanks . 
  we love you , why ca n't you love each other ? 
  i am not a fan of big cities . 
  give me a rural town , with a small house in the middle of a forest and i am happy . 
  but if i were to go for the best city it 'd be karlstad . 
  mei weibal is d'frieda waun is augreif , is zwida waun is net augreif , a mit da frieda is schwa . 
  have fun : gestan ho i in \u00f6d\u00f6g\u00f6d\u00f6ck\u00f6 valorn . 
  something to help you : oba hoatzn dam ma in woatzn , de ruam und in gugarutz !,

  [ a good german joke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48aumxifan8 ) . 
  we love you germany . 
  found a guy from a country where the saying `` nur bares ist wahres '' ( only cash is true ) still rings true with the population . 
  uk : [ dead man 's shoes ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419677/ ) . 
  this movie is amazing . 
  austria had so called siechenhaeuser , hospital like buildings where sick people were kept , including lepers . 
  there was [ one in vienna ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/siechenhaus_zum_klagbaum ) and one in [ feldkirch ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/siechenhaus_%28feldkirch%29 ) . 
  during times where there was little or no leprosy , they were used as hospitals for the poor . 
  some of those siechenhaueser were later used as so called plaguehouses . 
  places were they could separate the sick from the healthy during the plagues . 
  there 's a part of a town near me though , that is called [ leppersdorf ] ( https://www.google.at/maps/place/4612+leppersdorf/ ) . 
  that may be a coincidence though , as i can not find any evidence that this area was used to house lepers . 
  so similar to what / u/winnai reported . 
  they did n't ask us . 
  oachkatzlschwoaf - telling foreigners apart from bavarians and austrian since forever . 
  german speaking countries used to have this internally and it was called gesellenwanderung . 
  young craftsman that had just finished their training and were `` gesellen '' used to wander around learning from different masters of their trade . 
  this helped to diversify and pass knowledge around . 
  it kinda died out though , but is definitely something we should establish again . 
  especially across german speaking borders .

  shame on you for being so weak . 
  i draft you to six months rigorous draft training in the tyrolian alps . 
  schedule will be : 0500 - 0600 : endurance training 0600 - 1100 : hiking and climbing a mountain while facing drafts . 
  1100 - 1200 : lunch in a draft free alm . 
  1300 - 1500 : facing the draft on the mountain head on . 
  what does n't kill you make you stronger . 
  1500 - 1600 : battling the draft in psychological warfare by performing denigrating uresis against the drafts . 
  that will show 'em !, 
  1600 - 1700 : cold beer and show off against german tourists how we are not afraid of drafts . 
  remember : we were the first victim :3 ^ in ^ our ^ minds, 
  always . 
  it 's okay . 
  we all want bavaria and south thyrol back . 
  no need to be ashamed . 
  yes . 
  that 's how we do it here as well . 
  remember to hit the side of it for a cheaty win . 
  regarding the first : the majority of the austrian public is against nuclear power plants . 
  the only one we ever tried to build ( [ zwentendorf ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zwentendorf_nuclear_power_plant ) ) got shut down because of protests and a referendum . 
  then you guys wanted to build a [ new one ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temel\u00edn_nuclear_power_station ) near our border , and many were pissed . 
  but do n't worry you are not the only one who gets our piss [ for building nuclear power plants ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/11412205/david-cameron-snubs-austria-over-nuclear-ambush.html ) . 
  regarding czech drivers : many austrians who were unable to get a driving licence any more in austria ( due to dui mostly ) got one from the czech republic due to some kind of law loop hole . 
  many also registered their cars in the czech republic to avoid taxes . 
  that is why there 's a bias towards cars with czech registration and licence plates . 
  on the behalf of the austrian police : i 'm sorry . 
  i am genuinely curious now : what do you blame us for ? 
  edit : spelling, 
  yes !, 
  we beat ze germans .

  you have been unbanned from / r/aeiou let 's make a new grand state , and munich it 's capital . 
  just to piss of the viennese . 
  oh , and you have been banned from / r/aeiou :p, 
   not part of germany :o my fellow kangaroo folk , i am disappointed :(, 
  we had a [ civil war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_civil_war ) before ww2 happened . 
  it was short , but deadly . 
  it 's consequences were far reaching though :  however , austrian political parties often stand accused of having done little to come to terms with the past . 
  even at the beginning of the 21st century , austria 's society bears the clear marks of division into the `` red '' ( socialist ) and `` black '' ( conservative ) areas of influence that trace back to the time of the first republic and its civil war . 
  this continues to cause extensive parallelisation even where ideology rarely plays a role , such as in first aid services , automotive organisations and science . 
  i could not have worded it better . 
  this is the reason certain aspects in our country are still considered red -- socialist , spoe -- ( arboe , oebb , voest and other areas of the `` working man '' ) and others are considered black -- conservative , oevp -- ( oeamtc , landjugend , and everything related to farmers i.e. 
  lagerhaus , maschinenring and the raiba ) . 
  but , when you go to a town festival that is organised by the spoe , and you see members of the oevp bring their own food and drinks -- as avoid giving money to the other party -- there 's nothing else to do except to shake your head at such petty grievances . 
  there are rude people everywhere , austria is not an exception . 
  but most of us are nice people . 
  first of all , it depends highly on where you go in our country , but i have seen this more than few times : people come here with a solid german , and then are disappointed because they still can not join any conversations because of the dialect . 
  it is quite different in many areas from high german . 
  if we talk amongst each other , most folk who just learned high german simply do n't understand . 
  a friend of mine - who comes from northern germany - told me that it took him a solid year to learn the most basic words and phrases of the dialect , just to be able to follow along in discussions .

  threaten ? 
  bavaria has been sending back to austria ` refuges ' since half a year . 
  it 's not our fault that greece ca n't protect its borders . 
  if greece needs help doing that , they should ask , and not throw around threats ( like blocking uk negotiations , or blocking summit decisions ) . 
  well sometimes you just do n't want to invite they guy who threatens everyone and everything if you do n't do as he wishes ... 
  i do too . 
  for those bragging rights i 'd pay $ 70 . 
  edit : i now owe / u/emnel $ 70 . 
  you surely do n't mean germany !,
