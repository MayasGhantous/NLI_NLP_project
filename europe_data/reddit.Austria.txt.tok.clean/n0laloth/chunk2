  / i will show myself out, 
  dear germany , when you come down to visit us we call you piefke , laugh at your lack of understanding for our regional dialects and your crude sense of humour . 
  the truth is though , it 's all in jest and we like you a lot . 
  we admire that you work so hard to make this place - the eu - better for everyone . 
  and that you wo n't stop supporting us , even though we sometimes have very bad ideas and get ourselves in a lot of trouble . 
  so the next time you go south , we will make your schnitzel extra crispy , the kaiserschmarn with an extra pinch of sugar , and we get the best top shelf schnapps or wein for half the price . 
  just stay as awesome as you are . 
  being defeated by the czech . 
  there has not been a more worthy opponent . 
  na zdrav\u00ed my northern friends !, 
  but we already learn english in school !, 
  see ? 
  we already fully see you as our master of this glorious place that is europe ^ please ^ dont ^ bomb ^ us . 
  they can pry s\u00fcdtirol from our cold dead hands . 
  but i am happy with them taking vorarlberg . 
  the austrian ministry for external affairs has just replied with a very polite formulation for `` we ca n't be bothered '' . 
  thanks . 
  i have suggested a name change to our ministry of external affairs . 
  i do n't expect anything to come from it though . 
  yes , it seems we have lost some land in our eastern colonies to the enemy . 
  i 'll take it , so : idavald =  austria idavald vabariik =  austrian republic , or republic of austria where do i sign a petition on eesti 's awesome egov ? 
  how so ? 
  apart from the fact that vienna should be labeled `` 36 bullshit schoenbrunner-deutsch '' :p, 
   austria expected awesome eesti word , was disappointed :-(, 
  +1 no longer a neighbour of germany . 
   mexico  iran totally worth it . 
  it has gotten better over the years for me at least . 
  when i was in basic school our religion class was : god . 
  god is awesome , here read some bible . 
  here is how to behave in catholic mass . 
  this kept on through gymnasium until i went to high school ( htl ) . 
  in gymnasium we were even tested on bible verses !, 
  in high school though the compulsory religion class was basically over ( with 14 you could decide if you wanted to keep on having religion class or not ) . 
  and my new teacher there was far better , teaching us about basically every religion you could think of ( even about different branches of satanism , zoroastrianism , paganism and thelema ) . 
  i have n't been to school for a good bunch of years , but if the class is still like my high school class i am all for it . 
  if it 's still like my basic school and gymnasium ( middle school ? ), 
  years , thanks but no thanks . 
  i agree to a certain extent . 
  but teaching , for example , the history of religion worldwide is not the same as teaching * one * religion . 
  it could be easily packed into history classes for example . 
  especially if you cut * one * of the eight instances were we learned about wwii you have plenty of room to spare . 
  edit : spelling, 
  baby jesus ) master race . 
  this one 's so much better than mine . 
  `` jesus , i suck at drawing '' : [ austria ] ( http://imgur.com/w2t9s47 ) edition . 
  ca n't we work it out instead of throwing poop at each other ? 
  it reflects the inner heart of the german people . 
  :p / jk - luv bb austria, 
  same for some regions of austria . 
  but he 'd be fine in vienna i guess . 
  no it does n't . 
  i 'd also pick germany ( bavaria to be exact ) . 
  welcome , welcome !, 
  it does n't have to be a torture rig to get you erect . 
  neither arousal , nor an erection nor ejaculation automatically constitute consent . 
  the main reason this far right party is gaining is because they are currently not ruling . 
  history has shown that they gain upwind by blaming immigrants and by blaming the ruling parties for their mistakes . 
  this gradually builds them support by the masses until they are allowed to rule . 
  but once they are in power themselves , they make sure their own pockets are filled with tax money , ruin pretty much every project they start , and leave a lot of shit piles all over the country ( hypo aldria anyone ? ), 
  for those that come after to clean up . 
  once all of this comes to light they lose half of their votes again and the cycle begins anew . 
  the immigrant crisis just sped up this circus . 
  i was a krampus and i have been beaten . 
  wounds heal , trauma passes . 
  but you ca n't fix the void that the loss of those chestnuts left in me :-(, 
  a krampus in my home town once stole my bag of freshly made hot chestnuts . 
  that was about ten years ago and i have n't forgiven him yet . 
  i know who you are !, 
  good luck !, 
  in my region you get for your unmarried 30th birthday a big `` wedding '' wreath ( you know those you can walk under ) in front of your door . 
  however that one is made out of hay instead of lovely flowers , as to symbolise your withered youth . 
  in local dialect it 's called `` strahschw\u00f6hbogen '' , literally `` stroh schwellbogen '' . 
  [ here is an image ] ( http://www.feuerwehr.weisskirchen.at/2012/feb/12-02-08-schwellbogen-stadlbauer/10.jpg ) of an unlucky fellow . 
  in / r/aeiou deafst du di ned seng lossn . 
  do host nu amoi de kurfn dakrotzt . 
  we did n't do it . 
  you know it said `` aus '' , they just put the wrong flag there . 
  we get confused with the australia quite often !, 
   aus we can into kangaroo ? 
  the country code for austria is aut , and aus is australia :p, 
  slovenia is awesome . 
  not hungary at the moment though , because of that 0:2 . 
  after the czech have betrayed us , i say : bavaria . 
  i was ready to post here `` czech republic '' , why u break my heart ? 
  get your shit together vienna . 
  sincerely , west austria, 
  * fetches sword and shield * deus vult !, 
  uh , well , thank you ? 
  we love you too you know . 
  it 's not our fault that his wife lost them in italy , is it ? 
  what do you mean ? 
  it 's not sarcasm .

  yes . 
  this is an attempt to undermine the political basis of the right-wing parties by presenting their own hardline stance on refugee issues . 
   `` we rarely ask why men use more lethal methods . 
  after all , a suicide attempt is a cry for help . 
  and a cry for help shows a belief that someone will listen . 
  but if you do n't believe anyone will listen then you do n't attempt suicide -- you commit suicide . '',
