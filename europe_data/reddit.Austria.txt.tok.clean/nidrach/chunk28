  but i 'm sure that there are going to be some unique challenges when it comes to providing the energy for all of that . 
  when are people going to charge their cars ? 
  after work ? 
  like all of germany 's workforce at once ? 
  during dusk when renewables are starting to wind down ? 
  at their job after they arrive there so right when the industry is at peak consumption ? 
  what happens in a massive traffic jam in summer ? 
  how long are the batteries going to last ? 
  what happens if they fail on a larger scale ? 
  how are they going to get their caravans over the alps ? 
  can you even imagine the lines at charging stations in austria ? 
  anyhow right now it seems like a lot has to change to make that anywhere close to possible including a lot of cultural changes . 
  the whole role of he car in modern european society has to change and the technology as it today is insufficient . 
  no that would be step 5 . 
  well obviously if you found his reply funny . 
  so what ? 
  now they are a much stronger union than the eu and `` coincidentally '' the leading nation on this planet . 
  mainly germany and austria . 
  made from ore from all over the world . 
  brazilian ore for example . 
  and the part that wanted sovereignty lost the civil war . 
  why would germans steal dutch bikes ? 
  except for legacy stuff like different power outlets . 
  yeah but that 's a whole other discussion . 
  those sentences are all garnish and no meat . 
  if i judge past events as being amoral i do n't seek understanding of those events . 
  that 's a completely separate issue . 
  if i say that the leveling of carthage is bad i do n't influence the facts in any way . 
  i do n't change the roman motives , i do n't change the carthaginian motives . 
  all i do is express my own moral point of view . 
  that 's what you people do n't get . 
  whether the senate of rome thought he was doing the right thing or not is completely besides the point . 
  i also do n't care if hitler thought whether the holocaust was morally just or not . 
  that 's a discussion for another day . 
  that does not in any way influence my ability to understand the events . 
  i mean i get that you come from the land of zero tolerance schools and three strike laws but please understand that there is a world out there that is able to think in more shades of grey than black and white . 
  whether you can judge people based on our current standards is a matter of opinion and expertise has nothing to do with that . 
  and i wo n't read anything of you as long as you insist to bury in a mountain of filth . 
  no you did n't . 
  lol . 
  not even close . 
  you failed to back your opinion up at any point . 
  the assumption tells me more about you than it does about me . 
  when it comes to matter of opinion they are not automatically right especially when there are different camps within the body of experts on a subjects . 
  facts are facts and opinion is opinion . 
  why do you expect me to read a wall of text after an opening statement like this ? 
  the problem is with fundamental philosophical question where different opinions exist saying that experts say something is worthless . 
  we are n't discussing the facts here . 
  my position has n't changed at all . 
  you simply never got what my position was . 
  morality is always subjective . 
  that does not mean that we ca n't judge other people based on our morality . 
  if we judge romans morally we do so to make a statement about our world view . 
  the romans did what they did and it may have worked under their morality . 
  if we class their action as immoral we do so to make a statement about the current state of our morality . 
  that 's the only effect it has . 
  the history just provides the examples we can strive to emulate or to avoid . 
  genocide is not a moral term . 
  that 's where your mistake lies . 
  genocide just like homicide or suicide simply describes an action any any value judgment you apply to it comes from yourself . 
  just calm down . 
  you are n't thinking straight . 
  the state accepts certain motives like self defense out of fear or stealing food because you were hungry . 
  he does n't accept you killing someone because you thought he deserved it or because you wanted to defend your honor or any other reason . 
  the job of a lawyer is it to make your motives appear to line up with the accepted ones in case he ca n't make another defense for you . 
  it 's is not his job to make the state accept your motives . 
  the only relevant morality is the morality of the state . 
  that 's a subtle but important difference . 
   i do n't judge people by their standards but by mine . 
  that 's a statement about me so why would i have to argue it ? 
   the state does n't ask a thief what he thinks of his actions . 
  well he does in a limited way but he only accepts a certain set of motives that is defined by him . 
  for the most part what you think about your actions is irrelevant for the state . 
   please cite me 3 legal scholars or historians who said so . 
  i am waiting . 
  only if you cite 15 that say you ca n't . 
  i 'm waiting . 
  please use proper citation rules . 
  again you write an awful lot to say nothing . 
   this really explains your little understanding about nazis . 
  just read a book or two please . 
  i am not going to educate you about what you should have educate yourself . 
  what an amazingly empty husk of words . 
   you are a cute little bugger are n't you ? 
  first you lecture us about ~ ~ arguements ~ ~ ** arguments ** ~ ~ than ~ ~ ** then ** you do n't give a answer to most of what i wrote . 
  pathetic . 
  i ignore most of what you write because it 's drivel like this . 
   genocide ~ ~ have ~ ~ ** has ** a legal ( even though disputable ) definition which is created for the modern world . 
  you ca n't take modern legal definition of , lets say , homicide in britain and judge the past with it . 
  of course you can . 
  all a modern judgement is is an expression of our view of the actions of the people of antiquity . 
  it has no impact outside of that . 
  from a modern standpoint ancient roman conduct is to be rejected . 
  that it is different from a roman standpoint is irrelevant . 
  the is message is `` do n't be condescending dickhead or i will be a condescending dickhead '', 
  from a modern perspective romans were a horrible people that conducted countless atrocities . 
  that they were children of their time does n't change that . 
  nazis were also children of their time . 
  i do n't judge people by their standards but by mine . 
  the state does n't ask a thief what he thinks of his actions .
