  the main thing is that the benefits of the eu just do n't come by themselves . 
  the regulatory work they do has to be done anyway and doing it together for 27 states benefits everyone . 
  well marie antoinette was austrian , a daughter of maria theresia . 
  the english should really ask themselves if they should make fun of another country 's food , especially if the country in question is france . 
  free movement of people is not an isolated benefit . 
  it 's a necessity . 
  the problems start as soon as there are tariffs etc. 
  northern ireland would become the smuggling central of the world . 
  that would certainly create problems at the border sooner or later .1, 
  it 's not only her speaking . 
  she 's just the only one being listened to . 
  that does n't even work for north korea . 
  tl ; dr : germany appears strong because the rest of europe is weak but it is not strong enough to lead europe alone . 
  it 's just a name . 
  look at the million names austria or vienna have . 
  vienna , viena , vienne , vienni , wenen , b\u00e9cs , be\u010d , viyana , dunaj , v\u00edde\u0148 , wiede\u0144 , viede\u0148 and wien . 
  i mean czech for austria is rakousko ( ? ), 
  which is just random as fuck . 
  one more complaint and you 'll get degraded to czechistan . 
  yeah the official name is still b\u00f6hmen und m\u00e4hren . 
  if you are really interested you can find all the pertinent information regarding our election online . 
  should any questions beyond that arise i would n't be of any help anyway . 
  regarding your constitutional court i found the information also online and tbh it looks pretty bad . 
  the difference is that we have a working constitutional court that was able to overturn the election result . 
  poland 's constitutional court is a bit of a cluster fuck right now is n't it ? 
  and if it is decided that it is a shared competency and an eu exclusive one it has to be ratified by every national parliament . 
  yeah that ai n't going to happen either . 
  it 's so cute seeing you guys trying to act tough . 
  like a scrawny 13 year old posing in front of a mirror . 
  you even have the sleeveless shirt and a bandana . 
  simply adorable . 
  the eu does n't force shit on switzerland and norway . 
  also a common market is about more than just free trade . 
  only sweden is not fulfilling criteria on purpose . 
  not `` many '' . 
  expect that 's your pet name for sweden or something weird like that . 
  you assume that the brits are the intended audience . 
  that 's a stupid argument . 
  the decision is based on outlook and implemented measures . 
  afaik you first have to deposit the money and only lose it after a year without change . 
  the us should know . 
  the w is a free man after all . 
  some will even be replaced by a buzzword with buzzword technology in buzzword !, 
  it 's the sum of the changes that pose a problem . 
  also the number of judges necessary is pretty relevant if there are only 10 undisputed judges in the tribunal at the moment . 
  it did n't strike me as propaganda . 
  you may however argue against the points he raises if you so desire . 
  i would be open to that . 
  he does cite the problematic articles of the law in question so you could use that as a guideline for your arguments . 
  haydn and schubert are also important classical era composers . 
  vivaldi is too early and rossini is too late to be classical era . 
  germany votes in 2017 . the eu again in 2019 . 
  does that mean the uk participates in the 2019 elections ? 
  the chance that the talks get extended unanimously is 0 . 
  you 're going to have to bribe the smaller and eastern european countries out of your ass if you want that . 
  a rollback in the negotiations because either france or germany get a new government during the talks would almost certainly lead to a brexit without the talks being finished . 
  i would n't want to be a british lawyer should that happen . 
  you are aware that you have to negotiate with those countries during the article 50 talks ? 
  the best way to ensure disastrous talks is to snub your partners and make the talks collide with major elections in those countries by delaying then unecessarily . 
  well then do n't expect much movement in the negotiations until the frech and german elections have passed . 
  why you would want to collide with those things is beyond me but go ahead and do it . 
  i 'm sure that will help . 
  read the article . 
  the law in question renders the constitutional court inoperational . 
  this alone effectively ends the rule of law in poland . 
  the proposed changes would render the court completely inoperational . 
  cases have to be handled in the order the come in . 
  a blocking minority of 4 judges can veto a decision which then leads to a 3 month suspension of the court and another 6 month suspension after the second veto . 
  there are many other points raised in the article but theses two alone are enough to effectively disable the court for good . 
  roughly around the 4th one i can already see the queen being hanged from big ben in front of the backdrop of a burning london . 
  article 2 eu treaty ? 
   the union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity , freedom , ** democracy ** , equality , ** the rule of law ** and respect for human rights , including the rights of persons belonging to minorities . 
  these values are common to the member states in a society in which pluralism , non-discrimination , tolerance , justice , solidarity and equality between women and men prevail . 
  at least it could be argued that it 's not very democratic . 
  an independent high court is absolutely needed in a democracy . 
  violations of art. 2 can lead to sanctions according to art. 7 . 
  on a reasoned proposal by one third of the member states , by the european parliament or by the european commission , the council , acting by a majority of four fifths of its members after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 . 
  before making such a determination , the council shall hear the member state in question and may address recommendations to it , acting in accordance with the same procedure . 
   the council shall regularly verify that the grounds on which such a determination was made continue to apply . 
  the european council , acting by unanimity on a proposal by one third of the member states or by the commission and after obtaining the consent of the european parliament , may determine the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the values referred to in article 2 , after inviting the member state in question to submit its observations . 
  where a determination under paragraph 2 has been made , the council , acting by a qualified majority , may decide to suspend certain of the rights deriving from the application of the treaties to the member state in question , including the voting rights of the representative of the government of that member state in the council . 
  in doing so , the council shall take into account the possible consequences of such a suspension on the rights and obligations of natural and legal persons . 
   the obligations of the member state in question under the treaties shall in any case continue to be binding on that state .

  a name is just a name . 
  important is how the institution works . 
  just saying . 
  i want a second referendum and a remain win . 
  the uk would profit massively from a remain win since they could become the world 's leading exporters of salt . 
  i would probably buy quite a bit of it for all the popcorn i would need . 
  because some random guy on the internet made that map . 
  the balkan is a different mountain range . 
  i guess you swamp germans are n't that familiar with mountains so i 'll forgive you . 
  as long as the swamp germans sell their women cheaply . 
  of course the euro makes sense if your goal is to unite europe . 
  if you want to continue with that national state bullshit it never made sense . 
  because it made more sense . 
  same like a brexit never made sense a grexit never made sense . 
  the austerity policy is nothing to the readjustment that would have been necessary after a default and a new currency . 
  grexit seemed never likely .
