there is the general misconception , that journalists were more informed than the average member of the public . 
  the factual situation is , that journalists represent their audience . 
  sadly , in many cases this produces trivial programes for trivial people . 
  european right extremists had formed an `` association for security and co-operation in europe '' and visiteted these `` elections '' under this name .

  the outageous things that eastern european immigrants did in places like rotherham must finally have consequences - i truly hope , that the [ eu immigration problem ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-29870960 ) can be fixed . 
  he is also this subreddits supporter of ttip . 
  according to him , votes are no good , because people do n't know what is good for them . 
  but apparently immigration from eu-states is the uk 's problem of the 21st century ... 
  the economies of states , that were already disfunctional before are not an argument for spreading a disease . 
  i deduct this argument as invalid . 
  if potential physical harm was weighted lower than economical benefits , ddt would not be banned . 
  ggiven the number of potential cases , it is irresponsible that air travel from affected regions has not been stopped . 
  it was an eroneous claim , that the site was unavailable . 
  i wonder if he will loose his citizenship over this and what the outcome of this case means for the cases of those who joined isis . 
  you are speaking of the driver - i suspected this , as the media are unable to distinguish between drivers and conductors and confuse them all the time . 
  the reports about the driver using a `` phone '' are unable to identify the problem . 
  train drivers are not only allowed to use radio communication systems , in many situations they will have to do so . 
  there are reports that claim that the driver was contacting the switching operator to arrange the route for the delayed train . 
  the problem was , that the train was leaving the high-speed-line and entering a slower section . 
  while the high-speed-line is equipped with etcs , the slower section was not equipped with a similar system . 
  it is unclear , which the section in which the train was supposed to brake , was not equipped with any controll system . 
  this seems to be a conceptual error , but this does not relieve the driver of not knowing at which section he would have to brake . 
  even if he would have been falsely signalised , he should have known the speed limit from the milestones on the track . 
   the railways conductors conductors hardly exist any more in spain . 
  and the railway system is one of the things that work in spain much better than in some other countries . 
  if this were to happen , it would also be his fault . 
  sinn ruined germam domestic consumption before 2000 . 
  are there any polls avaiable ? 
  the author in question , udo ulfkotte is a right wing activist with little reception outside of his circles . 
  ulfkotte claims to be a reborn christian who had once converted to islam . 
  he does not seem to be connected to white power groups , but he has participated in numerous right wing groups . 
  his `` works '' mainly consist of claims that muslim groups and organisations were part of a secret plan to overthrow the state . 
  he denies the existence of the environmental damages that shell caused in nigeria . 
  ** < tl ; dr  ** ulfkotte seems to be some sort of paid shill himself . 
  that article seems like a banana-rant from a local newspaper . 
  the bridge in cadiz was necessary because public transport was a mess and the light rail will improve it . 
  any map will refute tha claim that this was a bridge to nowhere . 
  within the last years , numerous railway and light rail systems have been built im . 
  spain , most of themmn cofinanced by eu funds . 
  the only project that went wrong was the tram of velez-malaga . 
  the tramway in sevilla will not be effective until it is expanded to the railway station . 
  i have difficulties with seeing the point of this artticle . 
  [ who controlls the british crown ? 
  who keeps the metric system down ? 
  we do , we do ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zi_aealije ) anyone who promotes something as illogical as the imperial measurments can only act in behalf of some sinisiter agenda . 
  no , they have not . 
  especially if they tend to benfit the economy with the lowest standards . 
  the line between granada and antequera is under construction . 
  service to madrid will likely improve once it is finished ( and especially if at one day the line will be continued to almeria in the eastern direction ) . 
  busses may be cheap , but they have limited luggage capacity , are not that punctual and the seating space is mostly ridiculous . 
  this company refuses to follow the legal framework for offering taxi services . 
  its vehicles are not insured sufficiently . 
  anyone who gets into an accident with this company will not receive coverage for damages sustained as they have no insurance . 
  appart from this , their business modell seems to be constructed in order to avoid taxes . 
  a ticket from malaga to madrid costs 40-55 $ if booked one week in advance . 
  for a ride of 2 hours and 45 minutes and a distance of 497 kilometers , this is not actually expensive . 
  charging higher rates for tickets was not the invention of renfe . 
  m\u00f6lzer comes very close . 
  his rape-novell and his conspiracy-theories ( the eu is a necrophile conglomerate of black africans ) caused public furor and made the fp\u00d6 take him from their ballot . 
   where within nafta 's first five years of existence , 709,988 jobs ( 140,000 annually ) , were created domestically . 
  how many of these jobs are employing people who have to take 2-3 jobs to cover their basic expenses ?

  this map lacks some existing connections , i.e. 
  such a network would come close to perfection , althouh the car lobby would do anything to prevent its realisation . 
  in austria , they are sponsoring cryptoactivists to campaign against a tunnel that will reduce the travel time between the capital and the second latgest city by half an hour . 
  i do n't know about the german laws , but in austria it is possible to loose citizenship when joining a foreign army . 
  isis seems to fit the definition of an army , so it should be possible to extradite anyone who went to syria to join isis fromthe country . 
  it is also possible to invalidate a citizenship that has been granted due to false claims in an asylum trial . 
  people who got their citizenship per asylum where they had to testify their support for the state but join isis may have made such a false statement . 
  they had been sold to a lot of places . 
  as far as i read , they are supppsed to be deliveref to moscow , yekaterinburg and omsk withimn the next years . 
  that unit is a full working prototype . 
  this gallery lacks several notewotthy systems , especially [ tours ] ( http://www.railforthevalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/news-of-sept-1.jpg ) . 
  i also did n't see an urbos 3 . 
  it seems hard to find an explanation for this . 
  one explanation is that rubber wheels were supposed to be a solution for the rails of the paris metro , that were exhausted by little maintenance during world war ii . 
  this theory seems unlikely , as installing all the equipment for the rubber wheels would have been more work than simply exchanging the rails , that were already mass-produced 60 years ago . 
  there is no practical improvement from rubber-wheeled metros . 
  the smoothness of a ride depends on the suspension , not on the material of the wheel . 
  most of the rubber-wheel-metros are equipped with normal steel-wheels that run on rails . 
  the two wheel systems are redundant . 
  the energy consumption is higher than that of conventional rail vehicles due to the higher friction of rubber tyres . 
  blown wheels are a specific problem of this system . 
  the system is as pointless as translohr and other trams on wheels . 
  its only point seems to be that it uses rubber wheels , which may benefit the rubber wheel industry , but not necessarily the transport operator . 
  ** austria ** * the first president of the parliament has died half a year after beeing diagnosed with chancer . 
  she would have been a promising candate for the next presidential elections . 
  the field of potential candidates is now narrowed down to a conservative , absolutist prime minister of a federal state where things are n't going that well , the social democratic minister of labour and social affairs , a green former professor of economics and a the right wing 3rd president of the parliament . 
  * 1.700 police officers were used the remove 19 punks from an occupated house in vienna . 
  the landlord has invited the punks to stay in the house to scare the tenants away . 
  the punks arranged with the the tenants and opened a pizzeria . 
  the landlord then used other tactics in this and his other houses to scare tenants away , including nightly visits by threatening persons . 
  as far as it is known , the police did not react to the tenants complaints . 
  the whole operation was conducted in a rather ridiculous way . 
  the police was unable to guard the truck with its road barricades , which were consequently seized by the punks and used for their own barricades . 
  when asked , the police was unable to say how many officers it was using in this operation . 
  when the officer responsible for press communication was asked weather the number of 1.700 officers was true , he said , that it was a lie . 
  the number came from the ministry of the interior and was later confirmed again .
