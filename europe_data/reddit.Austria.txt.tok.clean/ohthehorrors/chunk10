  economists tend to argue that the economical effects of lowering the first tax rate would be better , as it would raise the purchasing power . 
  the peoples party also suggested hidden privatisations . 
  according the the \u00d6vp every company owned by the state ( i.e. 
  public transport operators , the power and water grid , the public broadcasting stations ) should start a fonds or give out a bond . 
  the investors should receive 50 % of the revenues of the state-owned companies . 
  according to the \u00d6vp , this would `` improve the venture capital market '' . 
  it is unclear , how the citizens should benefit from this hidden privatisation appart from worse public transport and higher prices for water and energy . 
  * a poacher killed three police officers and one paramedic . 
  after beeing active for years , the police came close to arresting him on early tuesday . 
  when the poacher was about to be stoped at a road checkpoint , he opened fire on the police , injuring one officer who died shortly afterwards . 
  he escaped , but returned after 50 minutes and opened fire on an ambulance , killing a 70 year old volunteer paramedic . 
  after escaping this scene , he ambushed a police car , killing its driver and wounding another officer . 
  he took the wounded officer as a hostage and escped to his house with the police vehicle where he killed the wounded officer . 
  the poachers house was held undersiege for one day , in the end , the poacher killed himself . 
  it turns out that this person broke into hunting mansions for years , stole guns and set the mansions on fire afterwards . 
  he had collected around 250 hunting guns , hidden in his cellar was an [ altair made out of antlers ] ( http://derstandard.at/1379291301210/waffenarsenal-im-geheimen-bunker ) . 
  it seems as if this poacher , who had a hunting license , was a gun fanatic . 
  psychological test for hunters are not mandatory . 
  * one month ago , a shopping street in vienna was partially turned into a pedestrian area . 
  some people are upset , because they ca n't drive there with their car . 
  for someone living 200 metres north of the mariahilferstra\u00dfe , the street in question , it would be impossible to visit someone who lives 200 metres south of this street . 
  i did not invent this argument , they brought this up on their demonstration yesterday , which was visited by 50 people . 
  meanwhile , over 90 % of the visitors of this street arrive by public transport , according to the chamber ov commerce . 
  * greek mp and chairman of the left party syriza , alexis tsipras came to vienna and tried to calm concerns about his party . 
  * left-leaning activists have again occupied a church in vienna . 
  they claim to be a protest of immigrants from pakistan . 
  * in vienna , an immitation of the octoberfest in munich has opened . 
  i tend to call this `` binge-drinking with an inherent conservative ideology '' . 
  the operator has come under criticism for demanding a caution of 1.000 $ from his waiters for items that could go missing during the day like glasses , forkes etc. 
  since the fall of communism , the countries of eastern europe have not put any effort into keeping their rail net in state or even modernizing it . 
  the same thing has happened with regional railways in western europe , but in western europe we saw massive improvements on the main lines . 
  nearly all infrastructure investments in eastern europe went into motorways . 
  this mislead infrastructure politics will likely lead to the same deficits in public transport we see in western europe . 
  i did n't say that the site was per se designed to be able to be acessed by more than 4 people at a time . 
  we may be conducting the classical reddit dos . 
  this is one of the sites of this type that gets close to what i would really vote . 
  my results are : 87 % with most of the social democrats and also the mouvement democratique and italia dei valori . 
  liberals and the greens following on the next 10 % with a few conservative parties like the centre democrate humaniste and the parti radical also appearing in this list . 
  if this survey had been more about issues like the environment and mobility/public transport/railways , i would have probably been much closer to the greens . 
  i 'd like to point out that there are [ statistics ] ( www.myvote2014.eu/de/your_vote/stats ) about what the users and meps voted for . 
  i am surprised , that 24 % of the users are in favor of acta ( in contrast to only 6 % of the meps ) . 
  i would have also expected the support for the finincial transaction tax a bit higher than 55 % . 
  the term `` reason '' may be far very from any possible application in all of this . 
  but while the use of violence against a police patrol makes some sense to a gunman with an escape in his mind , there does not seem to be any motive for what this subject did later . 
  he returned to the scene after 50 minutes and opened fire on an ambulance , killing one police officer and a 70 year old paramedic , who was likely a volunteer . 
  after escaping from the scene , he ambushed a police car , killing an officer and taking another hostage , killing him after having used the vehicle to get to his farm . 
  the strangest detail is , that this subject had a hunting license , he would n't even needed to go poaching in other hunting districts . 
  for non-europeans , there is the eurailpass . 
  i would sugest the route berlin-munch-innsbruck-milano-rome , if you 'd like to go straight through the alps . 
  you will probably stop in munich or innsbruck for one day , both cities are worth visiting . 
  ** austria ** * several persons with connections to the forme governemnt party bz\u00d6 were sentenced due to illegal party funding . 
  the bz\u00d6 was sentenced to pay 960.000 $ back to the telekom austria , a partially nationalized telecommunication company . 
  ut was found that money was moved from the telekom to the bz\u00d6 in order to finance the parties operating costs . 
  * frank stronach and his new party continue to irritate the country . 
  * elections for the parliament are comming closer . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.raildude.com/en/eurail-select-pass-3-countries ) it says that a 3 country pass for 6 days within two months costs 345 usd . 
  i can recommend that shop , you can also make reservations through them . 
  great . 
  my hometown , linz is one of the dirtiest places in the continent . 
  it is the red-orange area in the northen middle of austria . 
  this is very remarkable as linz and its surrounding communities in a 50 km-radius only have about 460.000 inhabitants . 
  much more densely populated areas like vienna , budapest , athens , rome , napoli , marseille , lyon , dresden , leipzig and most cities on the hispanic peninsula are far less polluted . 
  it is not the industry that causes the pollution , it is the traffic . 
  linz is invaded by commuters every day , but the public transport system is simply bad . 
  this is one of many strange points of the current green party . 
  they became quite strange during the last years . 
  they became a party of people who claim to be left , but follow a more and more conservative agenda . 
  they formed coalitions with the conservative party in several federal states and all they did was to act as a majority-giver for the conservative party . 
  despite the having improvements of public transport and better environmental politics in their election programmes , they supported the conservative party in scrapping the public transport network from year to year . 
  their programme turned into a mixture of pro-immigration-politics and some conservative stuff . 
  stronachs party was founded ~ 4 months ago . 
  he delivered a strange speech in which he called the founding of his party `` the most important event in history '' . 
  he continued to - some people say buy - backrow mps from other parties and by doing so gained club-status for his now 5-mp-party without having been elected . 
  in his first interview in the 10pm-news , he puzzled the audiance and the anchorman by his characteristical attitude to derail any intervies ( [ see / u/unseen _ redditors transcript ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1d9n54/whats_going_on_in_your_region_of_europe_28413/c9og9ix ) . 
  his political points have been compared to the tea party by the economist \u00d6tsch . 
  he calls for a radical thatcherism , a night-guard-state and low taxes . 
  his politics in one sentence would be : `` we are the one percent '' . 
  i am under the impression that stronach does not really know what he is talking about . 
  in his recent tv debate with the prime minister , the following dialogue took place ( i may have overheared some words ) : * stronach * : we need a tax on officials , thats where the dog lies burried . 
  they never created a workplace and are alway blocking things * prime minister faymann * : who are those officials ? 
  i do n't know whom you have in mind . 
  * stronach * : just like thos privilege-holders at the national bank , just like ewald novotny . 
  * faymann * : novotny is not an official but the governeur of the national bank . 
  * stronach * : thats no difference . 
  they are all sp\u00d6-officials , thats nepotism . 
  all of stronachs public appearances work like this . 
  he has his often incosistent argument , which he continues to repeat for the next hour . 
  despite his lack of arguments , he is expected to get 8-9 % in the elections . 
  many of his supporters come from the far right . 
  despite having the first place on his parties list , which would very likely bring him into pariament , he is expected to resign from politics after this election . 
  if he would accept beeing voted into parliament , he would not be able to attend most parlamentiary seassons due to canadian tax laws which require him to be in canada for at least half of the year . 
  ** austria ** * elections are comming closer ( 1 ) . 
  the neoliberal-nihilist candidate frank stronach , an 80 year old billionaire , prosposed introducing the death penalty for commercial murder . 
  he later had a strange tv debate with the prime minister . 
  the vice-prime-minister , who appeared to have taken an overdose of coffeine or worse things tried to negotiate with stronach about selling him the national infrastructure in the debate between those two strange subjects . 
  luckily , both of them will be irrelevant after the election . 
  * elections are comming closer ( 2 ) . 
  the green party has published a `` eva - the green girls magazin '' , a pamphlet aimed at young voters with articles such as `` eco condoms '' , `` i love my vagina '' , `` do it yourself fingernails '' , `` win 1000 $ for fashion shopping '' and something about not having to fit into traditional gender roles . 
  * a nsa-outpost has been identified in vienna . 
  * elections are comming closer ( 3 ) .
