  it is impossible to accomodate such numbers , both financially and physically . 
  the minister of finances has estimated , that accomodating the 40.000 migrants which have already entered austria this year may cost 1 billion euros . 
  if the entry numbers remain on this level , another 40.000 migrants will enter the country in the next week . 
  as there are no quarters , we may see slum-like settlements . 
  it also unclear how the migrants will react if they are not allowed to enter germany . 
  there are two state elections within the next month , it appears that they will greatly benefit the right-extremist party . 
  they are corrupt and incompetent , but all the troubles they caused seem to be forgotten by the electorate as they can position themselfes as the only party , that is against immigration . 
  * i corrected some mistakes in the post above , thanks for the cues . 
  * ** a brief summary of today : ** the army will be sent to the border , but it is unclear if they can effectively close it . 
  according to the minister of the interior , 18.000 transiting migrants are currently in austria . 
  10.000 migrants left the country , but an equal number entered the country . 
  there are estimations of up to 20.000 migrants entering the country for today . 
  germany seemed to let them in in the morning , the austrian authorities are planning to simply bring migrants from the hungarian border to the next german bordercrossing . 
  train traffic to hungary was supposed to be reopened today , but this was not possible due to migrants walking on the tracks to germany . 
  according to media reports , hungary is now sending migrants which have been in r\u00f6szke directly to the austrian border . 
  [ der standard reports ] ( https://derstandard.at/jetzt/livebericht/2000022178321/1000037386/regierung-beschliesst-heeres-assistenzeinsatz-und-verstaerkte-kontrollen-an-grenzen ) , that the nickelsdorf border crossing has been closed at 1:50 pm . 
  the hungarian boarder fence was closed a few minutes before 5 pm . 
  rail traffic to germany was again suspended , the germans are currently not letting the migrants in , they are getting stuck in salzburg . 
  the motorway to the eastern border was closed due to people walking on the motorway . 
  if you are taking a bus , you are going to suffer anyways and should be aware that major delays are somewhat normal . 
  you may have your passport with you , so there should not be a problem . 
  * edit : * i do n't know if you have heavy luggage , but if it is impossible to get to austria form germany using public transport , you could go to freilassing ( [ map link ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/47.8347/12.9856 ) ) . 
  from there , you have two options : the salzburg public transport system extends to freilassing . 
  however , it is unclear if the relevant bus line 24 operates if rail transport is closed . 
  if this bus line would not operate , you could walk across the boarder . 
  from the train station of freilassing , you 'd have to go along the streets b344/b155 ( there is cycle - / sideway ) for about 1 or 2 kilometers across the river inn . 
  the next useful bus stops are `` rott '' and `` eugen m\u00fcller stra\u00dfe '' ( they are on different sides of the same crossing ) , which are served several times per hour by various lines . 
  on the linked map , you can view the bus lines after clicking on the `` layers '' - button and then selecting the transport layer . 
  timetable information for salzburg is available via the application `` qando salzburg '' . 
  if you have heavy luggage , i suggest you to buy something like [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.de/tectake%c2%ae-sackkarre-transportkarre-stapelkarre-belastbar/dp/b008rv20ck/ref=sr_1_1?s=diy&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1442183396&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=sackkarre ) or a more practical version like [ this ] ( http://www.amazon.de/wenko-8074500-transportkarren-slim-zusammenklappbar/dp/b004t5emqu/ref=sr_1_33?s=diy&amp;ie=utf8&amp;qid=1442183432&amp;sr=1-33&amp;keywords=sackkarre ) . 
  such things are great for transporting heavy luggage . 
  i will be translating the relevant parts from the linked article in this comment . 
  the cursive parts in brackets are explanations which i have inserted for context information . 
  * further procedures are unclear .
