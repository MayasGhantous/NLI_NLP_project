  vice chancellor sigmar gabriel ( spd ) spoke of a situation , that puts germany at its breaking points . 
  `` the speed is even more problematic than the numbers '' . 
  transport minister alexander dobrindt ( csu ) said on sunday . 
  `` the limits are reached , this signal must be unambiguosly transmitted . '', 
  merkel spoke of an unbelievable struggle '' : at a cdu-congress on saturday in berlin , she defended her decission to let tens of thousands of immigrants enter from hungary . 
  it had been a crisis situation , she said . 
  ( 14:53 ) * alexandra f\u00f6derl-schmid ( * editor-in-chief of der standard * ) spoke with police press officer helmut marban in nickelsdorf ( * the village , where a motorway and a rail line cross the border to hungary ( [ map link ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/304251#map=9/47.9283/17.2485 ) ) for today , 10.000 migrants will be expected , said marban . 
  this would be the hughest rush on a single day . 
  last weekend , 15.000 migrants in total had crossed the border . 
  ( 14:18 ) * volunteer supporters complained to the police at the nickelsdorf border crossing , that taxi drivers were offering transports to vienna for supposedly horrid prices . 
  the police promises to make an anouncement . 
  a taxi driver barges in and says that he had only taken 20 $ yesterday . 
  immigrants report about offers between 150 and 200 euro . 
  ( 14:14 ) * standard-editor-in-chief alexandra f\u00f6derl-schmid is in nickelsdorf ( * see two paragraphs above * ) she writes : `` 3.200 migrants have arrived at the border crossing until today midday '' , police press officer helmut marban says to the standard . 
  some of them have been transported with buses to vienna . 
  at 1 pm , trains will circulate between vienna and nickelsdorf . 
  one train can transport 400 persons . 
  the insurge will likely increase today . 
  `` it could even become a five-digit number '' , says marban . 
  ( 12:57 ) ( * on a related note : scheduled trains were chanceled in germany to transport immigrants from munich to other parts of the country . 
  regular travellers are said to be stuck due to this . 
  i will supply translations of the relevant parts within the next minutes . 
  this site belongs to a political sect . 
  they also have a so called `` online-newspaper '' , which is similarly useless . 
  it is not a serious source of information . 
  the line between vienna , st. p\u00f6lten , linz , salzburg and munich/innsbruck has been over capacity for the last days . 
  it has is impossible for normal travellers to get a place in some trains , several trains , especially those to germany are subjected to severe delays . 
  this line is the most used line in the country as it has been upgraded to speeds of 230 km/h between wien and linz/wels . 
  for people from the upper austrian central area which is 200 km or 1:15 -1:30 hours away by train from vienna , it became possible to commute to vienna , especially if they do n't have to be there every working day . 
  the opening of a tunnel that reduced travelling times between vienna and st. p\u00f6lten by almost 50 % which increased the use of public transport by those local and medium-distance commuters . 
  even before this situation , certain trains were regularly overcrowded . 
  people , who relay upon those connections face delays , missed connections and the risk of getting stranded if they can not get a train to their last possible connection . 
  the police seems powerless to controll the acess to trains . 
  attempts to contingent the places on trains appear to have failed . 
  ** update : ** one hour ago , i overheard a conversation between the conductor and a other railway staff at the platform . 
  in summary , it appears that there are instructions to reduce the inflow of migrants by train and to forward them to germany as fast as possible , as a closure of the german boarder is expected . 
  the information , that is sourced in that article , i.e. 
  the registry data seems to be real . 
  i would however be sceptical about the interpretations they present . 
  unzensuriert.at is to be taken with a grain of salt , as it is operated by a group of far-right members of the generally right-extremist fp\u00d6 . 
  for the tramrus , a tramway derived from the citadis , the calculation is 5 persons per square meter , which is probably more similar to the real density during peak hours than 4 persons . 
  it is very hot now . 
  i prefer to stay inside . 
  if i had known that it would be that hot ( 36 \u00b0 ) , i would have probably taken a train into the alps . 
  i am currently looking at a statistics textbook but noise disturbs me . 
  a motorway starting to be built nearby which will greatly ruin the area . 
  if it gets colder in the evening , i will take the bus down into the valley to yell at the construction workers . 
  i have a can of surstr\u00f6mming and i am unsure of what to do with it . 
  the problem in the case of spain was , that other countries constructed infrastructure in the periods between the wars and between 1950 and 1980 . 
  the civil war and fascism prevented any advancement in spain . 
  the consequence was , that the spanish rail infrastructure , that existend in 1990 was insufficient . 
  some lines are probably less necessary than others . 
  the line between valladolid and ourense was probably not the most efficient solution and galicia should instead have been connected to leon which would have been shorter and given a better usage to the route between leon and valladolid . 
  apart from the routes in construction or planning , there are only lines which are really necessary : granada-almeria-murcia-valencia as a connection between the densly populated areas along the mediterranean coast and ( sevilla ) - huelva-faro as a connection between portugal and andalucia . 
  the line along the atlantic coast should be upgraded too , but from the distances there , speeds around 160 km/h would be sufficient . 
  it is worth noting , that infrastructure in spain has greatly improved within the last 10 years . 
  this also includes tramway and metro networks in various cities . 
  the faster connections between the east and innsbruck go through germany . 
  the line throught the alps is quite slow , but the part through germany is also severely neglected . 
  i changed it , it should say what i meant now . 
  i seriously doubt that there is enough demand for an airport in ciudad real , as it is connected very well by train to madrid . 
  they are not on a fridge though . 
  austria just introduced a tax on storage media for the `` damages '' that are caused to copyrightholders by the right to make the so-called private copy that has been declared illegal by this . 
  if this should go to the ecj , this would become very interesting . 
  i think it is about the massive improvement of the rail connection between central denmark , southern sweden and germany . 
  the current line with the ferry is said to be absurdly slow and does not allow any usefull services . 
  [ given videos like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxhorirlfic ) , i 'm not sure if it is working so well . 
  `` welcome the diversity '' is an absurd piece of rhetorics . 
  according to [ eurobarometer 82 , p. 61 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/eb/eb82/eb82_anx_en.pdf ) . 
  less than 1/3 support further immigration . 
  governments will have to act according to this or right wing parties will gather further support . 
  ** austria ** * elections for the federal state parliaments of styria and burgenland . 
  the elections have turned into a bit of a vote over immigration . 
  as all the other parties refuse to be even critical of further immigration , the right extremist fp\u00d6 has come close to 1/3 of the votes for parties that got over the threeshold . 
  the core issue of the state politics for this election were fusions of minor communities . 
  the fp\u00d6 had a campaign that claimed that it was the end of civilisation that villages with under 1000 inhabitants do n't have their own city hall anymore . 
  the election in burgenland had taken the same course . 
  both states were won by the social democrats , the conservatives got the second place place and right extremists got the third place . 
  with 27 % , they are just to percent points behind the social democrats in styria . 
  * a [ new website ] ( http://www.eaudestrache.at/ ) collects comments from the facebook pages of the right extremist party fp\u00d6 . 
  the audience has shown mixed reactions . 
  some are amused , while others are terrified about comments like ** `` i say just one thing : arbeit macht frei '' ** ( about criminal asylants ) ** `` through the chimney '' ** ( about the same criminal asylants ) or ** `` this fanatical inzest is getting more and more dangerous '' ** ( about public religious activities of muslims ) . 
  * after a 35 year long legal battle , the federal administrative court had validated the building permit for a tunnel under the semmering mountain ridge . 
  this eastern part of the alps is the central obstacle for the rail line between vienna and the southern parts of the country as well as italy , slovenia and croatia . 
  this is something rare . 
  the only other station with three gauges appears to be in latour de carol with almost the same gauges . 
  if you do n't live in a metropolitan area , air travel is useless for distances under 1500 km . 
  if i 'd i.e. 
  like to get from the 3rd largest town in austria to most parts of france , i 'm faster by train . 
  the line from munich to salzburg does not cross the alps . 
  the part between munich and salzburg will be `` only '' take one hour in the future , the part between salzburg and linz will remain slow for a longer time . 
  the connection between austria and germany is fairly bad . 
  both routes - munich-salzburg and n\u00fcrnberg-passau are slow . 
  once the fehmarnbelt crossing will be finished , there could be trains running through from stockholm to hamburg . 
  they have a very interessting tendency towards turning the state into a self-service shop for themselfes . 
  this may be the case , but from all the parties involved , assad may be the least bad . 
  the so called free syrian army has long merged with islamist groups , daesh , jabahat al-nusra and other sects . 
  the kurds may be able to form some sort of state in the kurd-dominated areas but for the rest of syria , there is no alternative . 
  assad also seems to have some sort of within the population . 
  about half of the none european immigrants in sweden are not economically active .
