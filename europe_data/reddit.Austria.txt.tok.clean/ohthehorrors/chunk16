  it appears that this rate has worsened by twenty percent points within the last year . 
  the same problem appears everywhere in europe , but it seems to be worse in sweden .

  there are many ways to lower government expenditure and to increase its revenue . 
  making cuts that affect most of the general population is not a sustainable policy . 
  the upper quantiles of the wealth distribution curve did not have to bear any additional contributions although their wealth has increased since 2008 . 
  however , this is not only a british problem . 
  both of them have mostly abandoned the socioeconomic positions their social democratic parties stood for . 
  schr\u00f6der has implemented hartz iv , a `` social security '' scheme that was one of the main reasons for the growth in underpaid jobs in germany . 
  schr\u00f6der and blair seem to have social democratic parties into groups with a trivial ideology that lack anything they once stood for . 
  sadly , the left , if we count people like blair and schr\u00f6der as such , has sometimes been more neoconservative than the conservatives . 
  the conservatives have privatised the postal service and other assets . 
  despite the idea itself beeing not good , they inted to do the same with the health care system . 
  one of their `` promises '' for this election seems to have been a [ 10 % cut for school funding ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/feb/02/conservatives-cut-school-funding-david-cameron-education-budget ) . 
  if the numbers from the exit poll should be true , it would be very interresting to know the voters motivation . 
  the core points of conservative politics appeared to be : privatise everything , let the poor pay for the rich . 
  i can not see how the average person has profited from this . 
  my bad . 
  appart from the sometimes old stock , cd does not really seem bad to me . 
  ava and altaria are cheap compared to other european countries . 
  madrid-malaga is ~ 50-70 $ booked one week in advance , if booked two weeks in advance , there are tickets for 30 $ available . 
  the issue seems to be more , that purchasing power in spain has dropped . 
  before the lavs were built , the spanish rail network was on the level of a developing country . 
  the last improvements of the spanish rail network before ave dated back to plan guadalhorce from 1926 , which was only partially implemented . 
  although some lines are of dubious use - jaen should not have been connected to madrid , but rather granada , the line from galicia to valladolid should have gone from a coruna to oviedo - i would not doubt the use of the network - which is btw . 
  making operative profits . 
  once the lines which are currently under construction and the southern part of the mediterranean corridor are completed , this infrastructure will work for centuries . 
  i do n't know why austria has such a low security rating . 
  since 2012 , there has only been one accident that caused injuries of rail passengers . 
  on the other hand , there seem to be some people who negligently drove cars against trains , but the commission for the investigation of rail accidents deemed the car drivers to be at fault in every case ( [ archive - versa/bmvit ] ( http://versa.bmvit.gv.at/index.php?id=219 ) ) . 
  malaga itself and everything east of torremolinos is not remotely as gentrified for tourism purposes as barcelona . 
  the issue of the supply for rental appartments beeing short due to tourism in barcelona is not even new and appears to be a very unique situation . 
  it appears that the province of malaga was very sucessfull with containing tourists to areas , where they still generate revenue but do n't disturb anyone . 
  the french version of knittelfeld ( where our right-wing party pathetically split up years ago ) is going to be amusing . 
  firefox hardly works on suse linux . 
  on android , it frequently crashes . 
  i would not use chrome , because google is a data kraken . 
  countries like norway are able to live quite well from the primary sector . 
  if african countries are unable to form working states , the blame is theirs . 
  * german * english on a profound level : * french * spanish * latin * ancient greek i have little knowledge of : * russian * hungarian, 
   going to a private dentist will get me an appointment almost immediately and most people are still subsidised for larger dentistry-jobs . 
  this is one example of where privatization would be a success . 
  your example shows , that higher prices reduce demand , but not , that privatised public services were more efficient . 
  of course one could say that shorter waiting periods are a factor for raised efficiency , but the higher prices of private-billed treatments would lead to some people not getting diseases treated . 
  although the dentitists internal revenue would be higher than in the public system , general welfare would fall . 
  public services are supposed to maximise general welfare , not internal revenue . 
  public services typically cover sectors where significant external effects occur . 
  following the coase theorem , a number of private entities could not act as efficient as a centralized entity , because the health of the population is - although it has economical effects - an abstract concept . 
  has information about his future health . 
  particpants in a privatised healtcare markets would therefore be unable to make efficient decisions . 
  various british parties and apparently parts of the media have an unhealthy obsession with anti-social security and anti-regulative possitions . 
  as a reminder : the crisis was neither caused by regulation nor public health insurances . 
  it is also dishonest to portray fn as the consequence of a non-neoconservative state . 
  it still seems , that the distance between the point where the plane and the crash site was three times as long as the distance between the point where it started sinking and both airports . 
  flightradar24.com has [ recorded ] ( http://www.flightradar24.com/data/airplanes/d-aipx/#5d42675 ) the flight route . 
  according to the flight recording , the plane has been flying in a straight path after crossing the coast line east of marseille . 
  it contiuned to sink until it reached the height of the alpine terrain . 
  it did not attempt to reach to nearby airports of toulon and marseille .

  i am not to sure if scandinavian states are a model to follow . 
  their statistical numbers are not that good . 
  whats the meaning of these numbers ? 
  how were they calculated ? 
  it does not appear as if they would reflect sustainability or external effects . 
  first : the paragraph you quote refers to the neoconservative bertelsmann-stiftung , which is not a serious source . 
  second : it says `` 6,6 million people without a german passport . '', 
  eu citizens also do n't have a german passport . 
  * dwarf fortress * simutrans * i also had a train simulator installed . 
  my father was a train driver and he was very annoyed about the lack of certain features , i.e. 
  they were even visible in austria , according to newspapers . 
  does anyone know , how the solar wind is today ? 
  this may make thigs look worse than they are . 
  but anye who believes podemos to rational should take a look at their subreddit . 
  there is an archive for the webcam , that films the location . 
  in order to get there , you have to open [ this link ] ( http://www.earthcam.com/world/russia/moscow/?cam=moscow_hd ) , click on archive on the bottom right corner , click on the image that says `` 10-11 pm '' when hoovering over it and then click on the link that says `` 10:01 - 10:45 pm '' . 
  at the timestamp 22:37 , the first flames become visible . 
  the fire has consumed most of the scaffolding just 3 minutes later . 
  the archived video for 8-9 pm shows a light appearing at the same site where the first flames became visible at 20:09 . 
  the light disappears at 20:53 . 
  it may not be speculation to say that the fire was started by the construction works and that it could have been prevented if smoke detectors were used . 
  you will find lots of pictures in [ this forum ] ( http://www.tramwayforum.at/index.php?topic=91.0 ) . 
  scrolling through the 500 pages may take some time . 
  its not uncommon for a trolleybus to reach one million kilometers , see i.e. 
  it seems great that this path was restored . 
  there are a lot of hiking routes in the region , that have been abandoned since severe thunderstorms in 2009 . 
  this is regretable as there are remarkable natural reserves , that now remain mostly inacessible . 
  i went to spain by train . 
  to me , it seemed very interesting how empty the interior of the iberian peninsula is . 
  it is also fascinating to see the change in vegetation that occurs near any waterstreams . 
  as far as i know , there is no law against civilized people taking over a forum by sheer numbers . 
  we have a much larger userbase , therefore we should be able to strike back . 
  why should we not go to that site and take it over ? 
  haider was elected in democratic elections . 
  everyone could have seen that he was a scam , but for some reason , people still elected him . 
  no other parties were involved . 
  the decissions to agressively expand the haa bilances by using state liabilites in order to get cheap capital were made by haider and other members of the fp\u00d6 . 
  the article seems to be a missunderstanding . 
  carinthia was ruled for years by the neofascist prime minister haider and his fp\u00d6 / bz\u00d6 .
