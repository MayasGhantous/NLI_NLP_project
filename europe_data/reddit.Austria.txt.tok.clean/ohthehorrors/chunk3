   the official theme was the historic vienesse congress , that hat brought \u201e a century of relative peace and geopolitical stability `` to the continent with the founding of the \u201e holy alliance `` , as the invitation claimed . 
  actually the attendees were not discussing about history but rather about the future . 
  because today , europeans and christians were standing in front of historical and geopolitical conditions , that would make it necessary \u201e to restore the spirit of the holy alliance `` . 
   ** a visitor from switzerland **  host of this convention was the russian oligarch konstantin malofeew and his foundation saint basilius the great . 
  malofeew also moderated the voncention . 
  other guests from russia were the chief ideologist of the eurasian movement , alexander dugin and the well known nationalist painter ilja glasunow . 
  from france , the mp of the front national , marion marechal-le pen ( grandchild of the party founder and niece of marine le pen ) and the historician aymeric chauprade took part . 
  from spain , prince sixtus henri of bourbon-parma took part , from switzerland , serge de pahlen , direktor of a genovese financial company and husband of the fiat-heiress margherita agnelli de pahlen joind . 
  from austria , the chairman of the right populist fp\u00d6 , heinz-christian strache , his representative johann gudenus and the local vieneese fp\u00d6-politician johan herzog joined . 
  from bulgaria , the chairman and founder of the right extremist party ataka , wolen siderow took part . 
  also present were right extremists from croatia , gentry from georgia and rusia and a cathoic priest . 
   the media and the public had not been informed of the meeting , the participants were instructed to be secret about it . 
  a private security service controlled the entrances of the baroque palais . 
  not even the participants were allowed to take photos . 
  when the chairman of the fp\u00d6 , strache took a photo , he was immediately admonished by malofeew . 
   the starguest of the event was alexander dugin , a 56 year old publicist from moscow , cofounder of the nationalbolshevic party and chief ideologist of the eurasian movement . 
  dugin propagates a euripean-asiatic treaty under the lead of russia . 
  his ideas were noticable in the speeches of the russian president putin after the annexion of crimea and after the founding of the eurasian union of russia , belarus and kazakhstan . 
  in a tv programme , dugin prosposed making europe a russian protectorate in a peaceful way to protect it against homosexual marriage , pussy riot and itselfussian imperialists : \u201e we have to conquer and annect europe `` . 
  it was clear , so dugin , \u201e that a pro-russioan fifth column is supporting us in europe . 
  they are european intellectuals , that want to strengthen their identity `` . 
   ** laudations for putins proconsul . 
  **  did dugin refer to the participants of this conventions of the convention in vienna with these word ? 
  in example the italian historican roberto de mattei , who claimed the earthquake and tsunami in japan to be a punishment of god and saw homosexuality as the reason for the downfall of the roman empire . 
  or the bulgarian siderow , whose party claims the be the bastion against the advance of turks and jews in europe ? 
  die leaders of the fp\u00d6 may not have felt adressed . 
  but they have good connections to russia . 
  participant johann gudenus was invited by putins proconsul in ramsan kadyrow to grozny in 2012 and claimed afterwards , that noone was persecuted by kadyrow . 
  in march 2014 , gudenus travelled to crimea . 
  as an observer to the internationally not recoginzed referendum . 
  he also did n't see \u201e force or pressure `` . 
  gudenus did not want to answer questions about this convention : it had been a private meeting . 
   the 39 year old host konstantin malofeew made his fortune with the iinvestmentfonds marshall capital . 
  he founded a beneficial fonds for the support of hospitals , schools and orthodox churches . 
  he has emphasized the intercession of traditional russian-christian calues . 
  in a portrait of the financial times , he is described as a \u201e modern rasputin `` , who a direct connection to president putin via a monk . 
  russian media claim that malofeew was financing prorussian separatists in eastern ukraine . 
  a request for comment by the tagesanzeiger was not answered by his office . 
  in an interview with the russian edition of forbes , malofeew confirms that the self-proclaimd premier of the \u201e peoples republic of donezk `` , alexandr borodai is a former employee of him : he was whishing him much luck for his future wordk , because what was happening know in ukraine \u201e may disturb every russian `` . 
   less irritated was participant ilja glasunow . 
  the news of the russian annection of crimea had spread \u201e tears of joys `` in his eyes . 
  in an interview with the russian state television , the painter showed his monumental works of russian heroes and saints and claimed that noone would be able to clamp the new russia . 
  putins iron will was a wonder : \u201e i feel deep delight over his impertuable beliefs and his deeds fot the unity of the russian nation `` . 
   ** meeting in moscow planned **  other guests in the palais liechtenstein also laudeted putin . 
  one speaker claimed the russian president to be the \u201e redeemer `` and the reincarnation of alexander the first . 
  the czar hat smithened the \u201e holy alliance `` against napolen but also pushed the viennese congress to readopt the beaten france into its community . 
  following this picture , it was no problem for the participants of the meeting in the year 2014 to appreciate the representatives of the front national . 
  the 45 year old aymeric chauprade , newly elected mep and historican is an intellecutal as dugin would picture one . 
  chauprade represents the idea of a \u201e europe of nations `` with a strong connections to russia . 
  the 24 year old marion maechal-le pen remebered to elder men not to forget the youth . 
  a \u201e march of life `` through europe was proposed in order to win the support of the vatikan . 
  the convention of the nationalists ended with a classical concerts and a reception . 
  the next meeting is supossed to happen in january , probably in moscow . 
  the organized suggested the crimea , but other participants declined . 
  the controversial penisula is too humid and uncomfortable . 
  please do note , that this is my translation of an article published by der tagesanzeiger on the 3rd of june . 
  the original article is available [ here ] ( http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/ausland/europa/gipfeltreffen-mit-putins-fuenfter-kolonne/story/30542701 ) . 
  it seems as if we will have to stand another few years under a conservatively dominated commission . 
  after all the things the conservatives have done - acta , ttip , ttis , etc. 
  - i ca n't understand how they get majorities . 
  ** austria - exit polls ** \u00d6vp - conservatives - 27,1 - 5 meps sp\u00d6 - social democrats - 23,8 - 5 meps fp\u00d6 - right extremists - 20 % - 4 meps gr\u00fcne - greens - 14,6 % - 3 meps neos - neoconservatives - 8 % - 1 mep under the threeshold : eu-stopp ( anti-eu ) - 2,8 % ; europa anders ( left ) - 1,8 % ; rekos ( right wing ) - 1,2 % ; bz\u00d6 ( right populists ) - 0,5 %, 
  turnout does not seem to be that high , but there is still a considerable number of voters . 
  this seems to be a group that consists of various right wing activists , conspiracy theorists and esoterics . 
  the group that consists of about 100-200 persons is acting under the name of `` montagsdemonstration '' . 
  they are extremists acting on the margin to craziness . 
  they registered their website under the [ domain of the soviet union ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su ) ? 
  please do note that the nabucco pipline was projected by omv , the same company that is now working on south stream . 
  as the austrian state is only holding 31 % of omv , it is questionable weather it would be able to make strategic decisions for omv . 
  slightly unrelated , but these concentration camps are not really camps , but rather districts . 
  camp 22 is shown in detail on the [ openstreetmap ] ( http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1688342#map=11/42.5538/129.9106 ) . 
  from the rhetorics some of these obviously astroturfing commenters use , i suspect that they may be related to the local right parties . 
  for the non-german-speaking : [ here ] ( http://translate.google.at/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fderstandard.at%2f1996682%2fcomeback&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) ist the google translation of one of m\u00f6lzers readings , that may or may not have really happened . 
  everthing , that is said by `` m\u00f6lzer '' is a citation of p. 155 of `` der graue '' . 
  m\u00f6lzer is also the author of the novel `` der graue '' , that tells the tale of a last aryan who wanders through a post-apocalyptic world , raping a lot of dark-skinned persons . 
  in the end , he finds an aryan woman and the white race is saved . 
  as far as i am able to understand someone who made a traffic analysis concluded , that 10 % of the votes came from chile , major shares from germany and serbia . 
  it seems to be a modfied bulldozer . 
  by the way , i would expect a separatists group to run around with arms like this - not the equipment of a neighbouring country . 
  it needs to be mentioned , that unions in the uk or the us are an extremely useless institution . 
  in the austrian and german modell , unions are supposed to work for every worker . 
  the us modell of unions is bascially an association , that plays out senior workers against other employees of a company . 
  not a good idea . 
  they are hardcore-conservative and would change the political landscape to conservative/far-right coalitions for decades . 
  its amazing to see , how the same pseudostory gets picked up again and again by various news outlets . 
  its also in / r/worldnews [ again ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2144kk/in_nonbinding_poll_venice_votes_89_in_favour_of/ ) . 
  this number would be more significant , if the urns were not transparent and if the ballots could have been placed in an envelope before inserting them . 
  it does not seem as if there was a voting secrecy . 
  there is a wikipedia-article about this [ secession movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/venetian_independence ) , that describes it as a minor party , that got 2 % in the last local elections . 
  it seems , as if this group was campaigning or collecting signatures for a referendum to be held . 
  someone should request that subreddit on / r/redditrequest . 
  this `` trend '' is not exactly new . 
  there are thousands of such hamlets , that have been abandoned , because their agricultures became improvident . 
  the living conditions in these remote villages may have never been that good . 
  an urbanisation beginning in the 1970ies has marked the end of many of these villages . 
  the area between granada and the coast is full of such abandonned villages . 
  ** austria ** * * `` the enemy of every landlord is under arrest '' * . 
  graffiti sprayer `` puber '' has been arrested in vienna on thursday , after vandalizing property in an extent , that has not been seen before . 
  this subjekt has felt the desire to write his name on walls . 
  for three years , noone has stopped him from doing so . 
  within this time , his activity resulted with some streets literally beeing covered with his uncreative [ signature ] ( http://fm4.orf.at/v2static/storyimages/site/fm4/20140310/puber-collage_body.jpg ) .
