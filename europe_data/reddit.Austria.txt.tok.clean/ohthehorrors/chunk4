  parts of the town have objectively been made uglier by his crimes . 
  but `` puber '' is not only a nusiance , he is also a psychopathic homophobe . 
  while living in zurich , he has assualted people he believed to be homosexual . 
  in at least one case , he tried to set one of his victims on fire . 
  `` puber '' is subspected to be involved in arson attacks and the `` bellevue-riots '' . 
  appart from the fact , the he has been living in viennas 15th district after leaving zurich , little is known about his person . 
  he is said to have been working for a cleaning company , the magazine `` vice '' has published [ a picture of him ] ( http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrv7jufiroo3zt4j-opyojinn_wykqflj_6syamajjima4gq3kf ) , which shows him wearing a diaper with the words * `` i am god , you are gay '' * written on it . 
  for vandalizing property - the damage is expected to go into millions - he will face up to five years in prison , but commentators expect him to be sent into an instution for mentally disturbed offenders . 
  * the second problem of vienna has been solved . 
  the citizens of the 6th and 7th districed have voted for keeping the pedestrian area in the mariahilfer stra\u00dfe . 
  last summer , the town government has installed a pedestrian area in parts of this street , that is one of the main shopping streets . 
  the conservative and the right extreme parties have started a campaign against this pedestrian area , that was not really motivated by the issue itself . 
  the town governemnt , a coalition between the social democrats and the green party has reduced the public transport fares , and extended the parking managment zones , thereby reducing the commuter traffic in the outer districts . 
  the problem with the conservative and right opposition parties is , that they are extremly car-concentrated . 
  the voted was not only about the pedestrian area , but rather about the question weather there is a majority for reducing car traffic . 
  the majority for the pedestrian area is expected to be a motivation for the town government to set measures , that may not only benefit car drivers . 
  the decision increases the chances for an expansion of the tramway network . 
  * communal elections in the federal state of salzburg : the social democrats and the greens remain stabile , the conservative peoples party and the right extremists loose , the neoliberals seem to have entered local parliaments . 
  `` team stronach '' was not up for the election . 
  * the costs of saving the financial system from a collapse , that would have resulted from an insolvency of the hypo-alpe-adria bank will go into billions . 
  there has been no decision on a final solution . 
  on a sidenote : have civilian victims of us-drone strikes received any kind of compensation ? 
  since when is it within the states interests to create a private monopoly ? 
  if there are natural monopolies , they are to be in the hands of the public . 
  the paper itself bases on some questionable assumptions . 
  one of them is , that leaving the eu would lift european laws in the netherlands , therefore reducing the costs of their execution . 
  this seems to be only valid , if european laws would not get replaced by national laws and/or if the corresponding national laws would also be lifted . 
  as in the chapters about immigration and public finances , the benefits this paper claims have little to do with the euro , but rather with questionable thatherist ideas . 
  the arguments are questionable at best . 
  to claim , that any business would be better off if it would not have to follow one common legislation , but a varieta of national legislations , if it wants to export to other countries is quite absurd . 
  if this level of accuracy is an example of the right-populist election campaign will look like , their campaign will get dirty . 
  it is also interessting to see how such papers will always blame the economical situation on the eu , but will never find a critical word about austerity politics . 
  it may be worth noting , that this study was ordered by [ partij voor de vrijheid ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partij_voor_de_vrijheid ) , the right-populist vehicle of gert wilders . 
  apparently , that fits into the anti-eu-circlejerk the telegraph seems to base its line on .

  on a sidenote , i recommend visiting paimpol , where the abbaye de beauport , france is situated . 
  in the summer months , it is acessible by train , which makes it quite easy to acess . 
  the village itself is quite nice , there is an island nearby , that is also worth visiting . 
  on [ this stream ] ( http://www.ustream.tv/channel/euromajdan/pop-out ) they show a group of priests standing between the protestors and police . 
  according to the espreso.tv stream , the place seems to be full of people . 
  the probe is expected to reach the comet in august . 
  the lander will be deployed in november . 
  it is interessting to see , that it is warmer in central europe than in the iberian peninsula , especially the regions of cadiz and granada and even the maghreb area . 
  it would be very interesting to see an explanation for this high temperature area with its center between zagrab and vukovar . 
   i.e. 
  dumping the old demand oriented keneysian politics and reducing public expenses as long as the ecb will continue to keep wages low , reducing the government expenses g can work without reducing demand according to the is-lm modell ( see : clinton and greenspan in 1992 ) . 
  this is not exactly anti-keynesian . 
  i 'd like to give a reading recommendation for the eussr-troll faction : * [ warsaw pakt invasion of czechoslovakia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact_invasion_of_czechoslovakia ) * [ hungarian uprising of 1956 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hungarian_revolution_of_1956 ), 
  probably people , who have never been told : is = lm, 
  * ludwig wittgenstein , founder of modern logics . 
  * kurt g\u00f6del , mathematican , invented the incompleteness theorem . 
  * hans kelsen , jurisprudent , influenced legal positivism * karl landsteiner , discovered the blood groups , * lorenz b\u00f6hler , developed surgeries for broken bones , founded the health insurance system . 
  ** austria ** * the factions of the conservative party are struggeling for power . 
  * a state politican of the right wing fp\u00d6 is accused of having given contracts to companies with close ties to his party * survivors of the national socialist concentration camps call for the hofburg , the former residence of the emperor and the current seat of the president , not to host a dancing event of some right extremist groups . 
  * 125 years ago , the social democratic party was founded . 
  * according to the conservative party , a new pedestrian area in vienna will cause total anarchy . 
  * 2 persons killed themselfes while handling a hand grenade in a car in vienna . 
  * sncf/its sockpuppet `` westbahn '' has decided to end accepting tickets issued by the traffic boards vor/vvnb and svv , after the traffic boards refused to pay them more than they would get from the ticket sales revenue distribuation scheme and planned to throw westbahn out for demanding additional fees from passengers with traffic board tickets in december . 
  `` westbahn '' also decided to stop serving a station , that was mainly used by commuters . 
  as news reports suggest , people are now finding out , that for-profit-providers may not be the ideal thing for public transport . 
  i have a slight preference for the finish 1 $ coin . 
  remarkable designs are mostly found on the [ commorative coins ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%e2%82%ac2_commemorative_coins ) . 
  the british press has always been dominated by neoclassically coined economic journalists . 
  therefore , it is not surprising , that they share a traditional mantra of this faction which can be shortened to : `` socialism is evil and can not work , france is deeply socialist , therefore ... '' . 
  at the moment , the british press , especially the conservative papers , seems to be pointing in every direction away from them . 
  you wo n't find much about the drastically falling british bne , the shrinking savings and a gdp growth rate , that tends to swing around zero . 
  this article does not exactly cover anthing new . 
  it refers to a survey among mangers . 
  another report about this survey has been linked here a week ago . 
  that article ( i think it was in the guardian ) has claimed , that the survey was about production . 
  i am not sure , if there is anything about the gdp there . 
  this article tends to look over the fact , that the late monarchy was far away from any standards of good governance . 
  the habsburgs were clearly degenerated . 
  it seems , as emperor franz josef was a neoabsolutist , who , among several psychological problems , had issues with electrical light . 
  the socioeconomical situation was bad , in 1911 , hunger revolts broke out in vienna , as the workers had problems to afford food . 
  the housing situation was critical . 
  many people could only afford to share rooms and even beds with other people . 
  the article tends to focus on a distorted picture of this period and does not mentioned , that museums , cafes and musical events were only accessible for a very small , wealthy group . 
  the summary on lueger and the right wing is accurate , for some reason , the first republic is not mentioned . 
  apart from the architecture , i would not overestimate the influence of the late monarchy . 
  ** austria ** * josef staribacher , former minister of economy has died at the age of 92 . 
  staribacher , who was born in 1921 , was interned as a socialist oppositional during the austrofascist dictature and was kept for a year in the buchenwald concentration camp during national socialism . 
  after the end of his sentence in 1941 , he was used for military service , where he was wounded , leaving him unfit for service and allowing him to spend the rest of the war without any major harassment . 
  after studying economics , he was employed at the chamber of labourers . 
  in 1961 , he was elected as a member of parliament for the social democratic party . 
  in 1970 , he became minister of trade , commerce and industry under chancellor bruno kreisky . 
  he held this position until the end of the gouvernment kreisky iv in 1983 . 
  his political actions were influenced by the so called austro-keynesianism . 
  as a part of the kreisky governments , he supported the expansion of the social security net , the easier access to education and the reduction of weekly worktime to 40 hours . 
  * the new administrative courts have started working . 
  these courts will decide over appeals against decisions of administrative authorities . 
  before these administrative courts were installed , the appeal stages led through the same authorities , that had made the decision in question . 
  * in the same procedure as every year , [ dinner for one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvd_vlo9xcc ) , the traditional new years eve movie has been broadcasted . 
  this year marked its 50th anniversary . 
  * several people injured themselfes with pyrotechnics . 
  one person died , after a heavy rocket , which he had ordered from somewhere on the internet , hit him . 
  it is yet unknown , why it is till possible to use the postal system for transporting bombs - it was not , that this possibility had not been abused before .
