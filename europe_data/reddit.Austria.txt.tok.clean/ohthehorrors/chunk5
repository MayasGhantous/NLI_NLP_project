  * despite protest , criticism and already appearing problems , a motorway is planned to be built in the eastern part of vienna and the danube wetlands , which are protected as a national park . 
  the costs are expected to be 2 billion $ . 
  critics of this motorway argue , that the it would just induce more traffic into the town and attract transit traffic , while the planned costs would be more than enough to expand the town tramway network and improve the railway network in the surrounding area . 
  * in the month of december , the number of accidents on railway crossings reached new levels . 
  in one case , a car hit a train , that had come to stop on the crossing . 
  the crossing signals worked failurless in each case . 
  an inhonorable mention goes to the individual , that drove around the barrier at a crossing near gy\u00f6r / hungary and got stuck in the tracks . 
  the driver escaped before his vehicle stood in the way of rj 165 from zurich to budapest . 
  the engine was set on fire by the collision , noone was injured in the train . 
  the engine is expected to be a total loss . 
  * the constitutional court is going to give the final verdict in the trial of a dove-breeders widow against the local hunters cooperative . 
  a wild falcon had preyed a dove of the applicant , according to state laws , the hunters cooperative is liable for damages done by wild animals . 
  the hunters cooperative claims , that this law is unconstitutional , as it makes them liable for the actions of wild animals . 
  i would be sceptical about us employment rates , as beeing employed in the us does not necesarily mean beeing not poor , as there is a [ growing working poor-problem ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/dec/09/land-of-free-home-of-hungry ) . 
  wages too low to live from them may induce a higher demand for labour , but this does not mean that this additional employment is more better than unemployment .

  on the first one , a form of public transport gave me the final idea after indentifying the country . 
  in the second one , there is an astonishing weather change after leaving the labyrinth-like park . 
  the garden itself is an interesting combination of french and english styles . 
  c&d were quite easy , but the ultimate credit goes to the people of e , who put large banners with their towns name in the streets . 
  you could call it intentional , if you account for the fact , that this crisis has been handled against the historic lessons from the great depression . 
  when the great depression broke out , then president herbert hoover reacted with a mixture of laissez-faire and what we would today call austerity . 
  this did not work and the economical situation only became better , after roosevelt implemented the keynesian-inspred new deal , an economical stimulation program . 
  the handling of the current crisis ignored this episode of history and - like hoover - implemented austerity measures . 
  beck : 2013 . 
  i will vote for the local branch of the party of european socialists , the social democratic party of austria . 
  the decision has not been made easy . 
  some of their leading functionaries are an evil joke , a scaring example is [ laura rudas ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksfwty_imu4 ) . 
  another terrible example is the former mayor of linz , whom i hate with passion , who promoted motorways through the town and donated a part of a park to a sect he is friends with . 
  appart from these individuals , the social democrats seem to be quite reasonable . 
  i thought about voting for the greens , but their leading candidate focusses entirely on issues of homosexuals and immigration . 
  these are two issues , but not an election program . 
  when looking at the faction websites , the website of the ego does not really give an informations about their points apart from phrases like `` green economy '' and `` social justice '' . 
  i would not overrate the factions homepages , but the website of the pes at least mentions some things they want , i.e. 
  a regulation of the financial markets and an inquiry into rating agencies . 
  a summary of what happened : a spanish building company has recently found out , that it will require additional 1,2 billion $ to broaden the panama canal . 
  the panamese gouvernment is expecting the company to finish works at the price it offered in the biding process but may also understand now , why the cheapest bider is not always the best bider . 
  why exactly is this downvoted ? 
  has somebody missed , that the cdu/csu is planning to privatize db since 2007 ? 
  this is what happens , when public services are prepared to be privatized . 
  the index mentioned does not exactly measure production but rather a mixture of various features such as storage . 
  this `` news '' is not surprising , as economical activity tends to decrease in some sectors such as agriculture and building due to seasonal circumstances . 
  this is the country , that the ec wants to make a free trade agreement with . 
  not only should moral stand before someones economic intrests , there is also pracitcal problem from this situation : would these obscure arbitrary courts allow a country to ban the import of electronic devices with nsa-backdoor acesses ? 
  compare a yearly wage of  1.000.000 $ to your own wage . 
  the people , who fall into this tax bracket are the 1 percent . 
   these are not the `` rich guys '' that will bring in a lot of tax revenue . 
  if someone with a yearly wage of  1 million euro is not rich , who else is ? 
  the average worker with an annual income of 20.000 $ after taxes ? 
  such enormous wages tend to be perverted . 
  taxing the financial markets will be difficult , as long as the financial industry can keep lobbying governments and therefore prevent any move of the eu . 
  taxing such pervertedly large wages is one of the easiest things to do without any collateral damage . 
  despite this number , there are some positive trends . 
  france has one of the highest percentages of all employed people working in full time jobs . 
  productivity indicators are higher than those for germany , balancing the lower french working hours . 
  if france would have seen the same trend towards part-time jobs as germany , unemployment numbers would be lower , but for the price of having a lot of people in dead-end part time jobs . 
  the gdp measures the worth of a countries production . 
  for measuring the wealth of a countries citizens , the gni is a more significant indictor . 
  [ the gni development ] ( http://www.google.at/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:gbr:fra:aut:swe:bel:deu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=409705200000&amp;tend=1356476400000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) shows , that the uk has not only taken the largest losses since 2008 , but is also on the lowest level of the countries compared . 
  the [ development of the gdp ] ( http://www.google.at/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:gbr:fra:aut:swe:bel:deu&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=409705200000&amp;tend=1356476400000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) is not really better . 
  while a reduction of savings is an adequate way of increasing domestic consumption , they may not recover with low wages . 
  employment is not * `` rapidly recovering '' * , but rather staying [ stabile on a high level ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10604117 ) for the question of absolute numbers : living in a global power may be nice but of minor relevance if a persons living standards are sub optimum . 
  living in the bric states may come with nice numbers for economic growth , but from the point of purchasing power or social stability , living in europe is a bit more desirable . 
  the idea , that a fincial sector could hold a countries economy was the basis of thatchers devastating economic politics . 
  the main argument against this is , that there is no value added . 
  haldane and madouros from the department of financial stability at the bank of england have written an interesting paper about the question [ what is the contribution of the financial sector ? 
  ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/article/what-contribution-financial-sector ) . 
  they argue , that banks are basically just taking risks and make their profits from charging fees for providing financial products . 
  if they pay high wages , they finance them by charging someone fees like interest rates or account maintenance fees . 
  in the process of this , no additional value was created . 
  for the case of commercial banks , one could argue that they have given someone a credit and therefore made someone elses economic activity easier . 
  investment banks are just using obscure financial tools to create some sort of revenue . 
  their activity can actually damage the economy . 
  one example of such a damaging behaviour would be the investment fund armajaro , who speculated on a price rise of cocoa by buying 7 % of the futures for cocoa , therby causing the price to rise after having bought these futures for a lower price . 
  in the last ten years , more and more obscure investments have come up , with one of the most absurd beeing shadow markets , which mirror real stock markets , where investors trade with copies of real titles . 
  these activities are not connected to the real economy and an increase in them may increase the gdp , but is of little real relevance . 
  the british banking sector largely consists of investment banks , that do not provide a basis for a stabile economy . 
  i would raise doubts about this assumption . 
  econometric data shows , that the british gni per capita has taken an immense drop since 2008 . 
  the savings of the average person have decreased by a higher percentage than the savings in other european countries . 
  the improvement in the unemployment situation is mainly due to more low-paying third sector jobs . 
  there does not seem to be an improvement in domestic consumption . 
  i am not sure about what this article wants to tell us . 
  if the message is , that the economy will be larger in absolute numbers , it may be an unserious joke . 
  the economy of spain is larger than the economy of belgium by the gdp , but the average wealth and income per person are better for belgium than for spain . 
  per capita numbers tend to give a better information than absolute numbers in such cases . 
  it also has to be noted , that the numbers for the uk seem to be biased due to the financial sector , that has little real relevance . 
  there is a de facto minimum wage called `` tarifvertrag '' , which is negotiated every year between the unions and representatives for the employers for every sector . 
  the first major problem with this free trade agreement is , that it will weaken the european economy by opening our markets to american companies . 
  these american companies have a better position , as they do not have to contribute to working social systems , have weak environmental legislations to mind and do not have to comply with serious minimum wages . 
  why should we open our markets to vendors , who do not have to comply with local standards and are able to produce cheaper , because they are able to use questionable production methods like bathing meat in chlorine ? 
  the second major problem are the antidemocratic elements of the free trade agreement . 
  with this agreement , a company will be able to sue a country at an arbitrary court for its legislation not beeing compitable with the companies desire to maximize its profits . 
  this means , that democratically elected legislators will loose their independence . 
  national laws will have to follow the directives of an intransparent court we do not have controll over . 
  if a legislation decides , that it wants to ban chlorine-bathed meat , it may not be able to so , because the obscure arbitrary court may decide , that has no right to do so . 
  the third major problem is , that ttip contains large parts of things like acta and gats , that were stopped because they were unpopular . 
  if these things should find their way under the cover of ttip , we may find out one day , that the public hand is forced to privatise puplic transport , social housing , emergency services , the water supply and even parts of the government itself . 
  if more people would know about ttip , there would be an outrage . 
  additional context : before the departure of a train , there is an announcement , that advises the departure .
