  the leading attendent closes and locks all but the last door by remote . 
  he then takes position at the last door and after seeing , that all the doors are clear , gives a visual signal , which the driver sees in the mirror . 
  it is not before this procedure , that the train starts moving . 
  it is not just , that she ignored any common sense , she ignored also every warning . 
  the woman [ argues that ] ( http://www.courthousenews.com/2013/03/25/sachscomp.pdf ) , * `` 3 . 
  defendants , and each of them , moved the train bevore plaintiff had boarded . '', 
  defendants , and each of them , failed to stop the train while plaintiff was attempting to board and negligently locked the doors '' * this woman is basically suing on the grounds , that the train left , before she could board , that it did not stop for her and that the doors were locked , when she tried to enter the train . 
  as far as i could find out , the train in question was en 466 from vienna to zurich . 
  as there was not even an investigation against neither the the attendent nor the dispatcher nor the driver , the question of fault seems to be pretty clear , at least from rational austrian laws . 
  if she would not have left the country , \u00d6bb would likely sue her for damages from the delay she caused . 
  specifically for france , the higher gni per capita means , that the average person has a higher income and therefore a higher purchasing power . 
  the data also shows , that from the states compared , we can see , that the [ savings in the uk ] ( http://www.google.at/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:gbr:fra:aut:swe:bel&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=409359600000&amp;tend=1356130800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) have shrinked by a higher rate to the lowest level . 
  a recovery in domestic consumption is therefore not sustainable , but dependent on the use of savings . 
  the savings will somewhen be completeley spent and will not recover , if the households will not have an income , that allows them to save money . 
  for the argument of s&p 's rating depicting something else than the economic situation of a country , i would also point out to sweden , austria and belgium . 
  sweden has been rated at aaa and should therefore be an example of the level and development , that would be expected for such a rating . 
  austria and belgium have , like france , been downgraded to aa . 
  the development of the gni per capita shows , that sweden , austria and belgium show a higher gni per capita . 
  while the gni p.c. 
  rose for sweden , it stayed about the same in austria and belgium . 
  given the fact , that the gni p.c. 
  and other indicators show a significant decline in the uk , the aaa-rating is questionable and indicates , that the rating agencies rate something else than macroeconomic indicators . 
  there again remains the question , if this rise in employment is happening in different fields than the low paying segments of the third sector . 
  given recent reports in the british media , it seems , as if there was a problem with generally low paying jobs : [ 1 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/millions-of-workers-in-britain-snared-by-lowpay-trap-8965432.html ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/employers-should-raise-lowpaid-workers-wages-to-tackle-inwork-poverty-says-alan-milburn-8886436.html ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/sep/06/uk-lowest-paid-classed-not-working-enough ) , which also explains , why the [ gross national income per capita ] ( http://www.google.at/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_mktp_cd&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;idim=country:gbr:deu:fra#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=ny_gnp_pcap_cd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:gbr:fra:aut:swe:bel&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=409359600000&amp;tend=1356130800000&amp;hl=en_us&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false ) is still far away from the level of 2008 . 
   the uk has more people in employment now than ever in history . 
  where is this employment generated ? 
  i do not have acess to the necessary data at the moment , but as the british industrial sector still shrinking - just a few weeks ago , bae announced the closure of the portsmouth shipyard , i would suggest , that this rise in employment is happening in the third sector . 
  if this growth is mainly due to more supermarket cashiers or bouncers at g4s , it may not be , what is necessary to maintain a developed economy , although a part of this growth may also come from higher-paying financial sector . 
  appart from france and the uk , there are other cases , in which ratings differ from reality . 
  at the beginning of 2012 , s&p declared several countries , among them austria , to be at the level of aa + . 
  the netherlands were still rated at aaa . 
  [ here is a table ] ( http://derstandard.at/1385169398852/niederlande-schlittert-tiefer-in-die-krise ) for , from the top to them bottom , the unemployment rate , the growth in % of gdp and consumer expenses in % of gdp . 
  in 2012 , it austria showed better values for all these 3 indicators since one and a half year : this tendency continues until now , when s&p declared the netherlands to be at the level of aa + for which new development exactly ? 
  there does n't seem to be a coherent methodology behind these ratings . 
  i suspect the rating agencies for not doing a macroneconomic analysis but rather looking for neoliberal buzzwords comming from a countries politicans . 
  the gdp decline after 2008 was weaker for france than for the united kingdom . 
  the french economy is better structured than the economy of the uk . 
  the numbers for the uk are biased because of the oversized financial sector . 
  the uk lacks an adequate industrial sector , that generates a demand for labor . 
  i would not be to sure about this . 
  in the last year , downratings had few effects on the markets . 
  in the case of france , i am quite sure , that the participants on the markets have realised , that the indicators for france are better than those for the united kingdom . 
  the same applies for the netherlands or austria , both countries have been downrated by s&p . 
  the rating agencies and their position towards subprimes and other speculative investments have been major causes of the financial crisis since 2008 . 
  their ratings are of a dubious quality and may have started tendencies as self fullifying prophecies . 
  their position seems to be biased , the us and the uk have far worse econometric indicators as many other countries , which are rated worse by s&p . we should stop listening to the rating agencies and look at econometric indicators instead . 
  the us stopping their ambitions for this free trade agreement would be one of the better things that could happen . 
  there are so many things wrong with this agreement . 
  let 's look at one point of this agreement . 
  it contains a system of international arbitrary courts , where corporations can sue states for reducing their expectation of revenues . 
  this obscure law and its court are not democratically legitimated . 
  behind this free trade agreement stands the same ignorance against democratic processes as behind the statement of someone from rural america . 
  i really wonder , why there is not a ring bus line , that only stops at the stations . 
  taking the metro is painfull due to the complete lack of escalators in the passage between the metro and the station at gare montparnasse . 
  this photo shows kurz participating in the campaign of the conservative parties youth organisation ( jvp ) . 
  in urban areas , this party aims at snobs , who will accumulate in overpriced night clubs . 
  despite his strange campaign , kurz was made state secretary for integration a few years ago . 
  he turned out the be acceptable , as he did n't say any awfull things . 
  seems to be one of the better conservative politicans , but this may also be because the rest is terrible .

  i ca n't explain what is wrong with them , it is just an obvious fact , that they ca n't be changed . 
  he 's from the deeply conservative countryside . 
  he does n't know it better and he 's probably not meaning it bad . 
  do n't feed the troll is the right way to deal with such people . 
  the fact , that he is `` just '' a member of the conservative party may give the audience an idea of what is going on in the right extremist party . 
  vehicle controll systems are far from beeing failureless . 
  this applies for autopilots in airplanes and train controll systems such - even the fancy new etcs . 
  automated processes have the tendency to reproduce failures , just look at high frequency trading systems and their tendency to produce upward or downward spirals . 
  the problem with autonomous cars is , that they relay on a very small range of information on their environment , such as the analysis of pictures of their environment . 
  i see little foundation for the claim , that such systems lack the potential of errors . 
  apart from the well known sites , the following are worth visiting : * in burgenland : [ lake neusiedl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_neusiedl ) and the surrounding villages and protected areas . 
  * in carinthia : the inner town of [ klagenfurt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klagenfurt ) and the nearby [ w\u00f6rther see ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/w%c3%b6rther_see ) . 
  * in lower austria : the [ schneeberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schneeberg_%28alps%29 ) via any of the routes from puchberg.this easternmost peak of the alps is the only mountain that can be reached for a day-long hike via public transport from vienna . 
  * in upper austria : [ hallstatt ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hallstatt ) and [ gmunden ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gmunden ) ( both possible within the same day and acessible with the same rail line ) , [ lake neusiedl ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lake_neusiedl ) . 
  * in salzburg : the [ gaisberg ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaisberg ) a medium mountain at the edge of the town of salzburg . 
  there is a bus line from the town center to the top of it . 
  * in tyrol : the [ nordkette ] ( http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/nordkette ) , a mountain range north of innsbruck , that can be reached via a cable car from innsbruck . 
  * in vienna : the [ lainzer tiergarten ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lainzer_tiergarten ) , a wildlife sanctuary in the 13th district . 
  * the [ semmering railway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semmering_railway ) and the [ tauern railway ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tauern_railway ) are recommended because of the magnificent view on the mountains . 
  ketchup is a somehow strange substance . 
  most brands use high quantities of sugar , which makes the result taste strange-sweet . 
  with meat , i switched to a steak sauce which has a more significant , pungent taste . 
  a decent arabiata sauce can be prepared with onion , garlic and paprika , which should be lightly fried . 
  for the main ingredient , it is possible to buy a prepared tomato sauce ( passata di pomodoro ) , which should be available in all well-sorted supermarkets . 
  the tomato sauce should be heated and mixed with the prepared ingredients . 
  adding a few herbs will improve the taste . 
  the costs for one portion of this sauce should come to under 40 cents . 
  ** austria ** * teachers are planning to go on strike because the government is planning to expand their working time . 
  at the moment , teachers who are employed for 40 hours per week have to be teaching for ~ 18 hours . 
  the government plans to to raise the time teachers have to spend in front of a class to 24 hours per week . 
  the rest is supposed to be sent on correcting homeworks , speaking to parents , etc. 
  * the government plans to cut extremly high pensions of federal employees . 
  a controversy has started after it became public that a former director of the national bank is receiving retirement benefits of 30.000 $ per month . 
  * the tyrol branch of the oligarchist party team stronach has gone out of business , continuing the dissolution of this party . 
  * the protest block of immigrants and left extremists is active once again . 
  one year after a group of asylum seekers and pro-immigration-activists had occupied a park and later a church in vienna , a demonstration in front of the quarters for asylum seekers in traiskirchen has taken place . 
  * the vienna bus line 13a has been given a new route , after the mariahilfer stra\u00dfe has been turned into a partial pedestrian area . 
  originally , the bus was supposed to drive a short bit through the pedestrian area . 
  for some reason , the union of the bus drivers started complaining and the communal public traffic operator decided to try another route . 
  this route would have lead through a street where they would have had to abandon 10 parking spaces to allow the bus to pass in both directions .
