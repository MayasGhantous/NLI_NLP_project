  after storeowners started to complain , they moved the route to some narrow streets , where 20 retired persons have held 3 demonstrations last week , because there has not been a bus passing there before and that could not be changed . 
  for some reason , the media have given this issue much mor pubicity than a de-facto bad bank needing anotht 1.05 billion $ from the state . 
  * it started to snow in the alps . 
  snow is expected in the lower areas on monday . 
  did he thank the local gypsy communities for their indirect support of his campaign ? 
  it seems as if norc has gone out of business , their pages ca n't be reached since weeks . 
  i am not sure but i think they started before the data protection agency was formed . 
  it 's the same situation in austria . 
  we have an `` agency for data protection '' , that for some reason has the power to forbid publishing streetview . 
  their reason was , that it was an invasion of privacy to take photos of houses from the street . 
  this reasoning is very strange , as austria has the freedom of panorama as described in \u00a7 54 abs . 
  1 z 5 urheberrechtsgesetz , that allows taking photos in public areas . 
  i do n't even know how photos of publically acessible areas can be a subject to data protection . 
  there is nothing more public than house facades . 
  the same agency has also made dashcams illegal . 
  we need to get rid of this totalitarian agency , that is scrapping the right to take pictures in public areas . 
  on a sidenote , this agency remained quiet about acta , the nsa or a planned centralized electronic health data storage system . 
  this is even more strange as switzerland is one of the most conservative countries in europe . 
  i am very sure that the wholesaler prices are developing the same in germany . 
  it is only a question of time until retail prices will start to go down too . 
  would it be an option for the ecb to put the money presses into action ? 
  this is not only a spanish problem , the wholesalers prices in austria have also started to decrease in many fields . 
  the tgv and the newly built french tramways are amazing . 
  from the aspect of design and functionality , citroen cars , especially ds , ami , bx and cx had a hughe influence on todays cars . 
  the hydropneumatic suspension was invented by citroen . 
  the french aerospace industry became the backbone of eads . 
  thats not really bad . 
  the public opinion is shifting against the olympic games , as they are currently a very expensive event that brings little local revenues but causes hughe disruptions to the local economy ( i.e rises in rents ) . 
  a few months ago , vienna has also voted against applying for the olympic summer games . 
  liechtenstein ( that tiny country between austria and switzerland ) is a multi-party-system . 
  ** austria ** * the federal income will be lower than expected in the next years , in order to cut the deficit to 0 % of the gdp , further budget cuts are to be expected . 
  * members of the past local government of carynthia will be charged with abstraction of public funds . 
  all of them are members of the right populist/extremist party fp\u00d6 . 
  the prosecution sees evidence , that those people used public funds to advertize their party . 
  * the school system becomes an issue in coalition negotiations between sp\u00d6 and \u00d6vp . 
  despite the majority of the public and also a majority of their voters beeing against it , the sp\u00d6 pushes for a common school for all children from age 6-14 . 
  christoph leitl , president of the chamber of commerce and member of the conservative \u00d6vp could replace the unpopular minister of finances fekter . 
  * an mp of the stronach party offered a journalist to conceive a child with him during an interview . 
  * g4s has billed the town of klagenfurt for parking area monitorings that have never happened . 
  just a few years ago , the same company was found to manipuate and wrongly raise fines for wrong parking . 
  * the carynthian bank hypo alpe adria will need to subsidies in order to prevent a default . 
  a trial in germany against employees of the german bank bayrische landesbank could once again confirm , that the bank was brought into its situation due to a climate of corruption between the haa , the bl and the carynthian local government . 
  * the town of linz has a new mayor . 
  the new mayor of the 3rd largest town will have to deal with hughe losses from currency speculations . 
  his predescendent dobusch was mayor for nearly 20 years , he became unpopular for the speculation losses , his support of a new motorway in the town and his aversion against nature . 
  his predescendent really tried hard to bring people up against his social democratic party ( sp\u00d6 ) and started to show a behaviour of clientelism and nepotism . 
  * the greens will not participate in the primaries for the eu parliamentary elections due to their distrust in the electronic voting system . 
  * a couple has been sentenced to 5 years in prison for acessory to the secual abuse of minor by the landesgericht korneuburg . 
  the gypsy couple has taken a 13 year old girl from bosnia and married her to their 17 year old mentally disabled son . 
  the girl conceived a child and was brought back to bosnia . 
  the defendents claimed that they were not aware about their actions beeing illegal . 
  the media did not report about the current whereabouts of the girl . 
  * the communal public transport operator of vienna has received the first of 217 mercedes citaro busses . 
  * a branch railway line north of salzburg will be expanded by three kilometers from its current end in trimmelkam to ostermiething , a major village in upper austria ) . 
  this measure is expected to get more commoters to salzburg on the public transport and therefore reduce the car traffic problem in salzburg . 
  this may be the first expansion of a branch railway line within the last 60 years . 
  * snowfall is expected down to 400 metres on monday . 
  the groups who aim at an independence of south tyrol from italia seem to campaign for its reunification with austria . 
  anyways , they are not that important and i do n't know if anyone in north tyrol would like to leave austria . 
  there has in fact never been a serious activism for the separation of carynthia . 
  it think this refers to the idea of a right extremist local politican , who wanted to get an addition to the name of the federal state of carynthia , that should express something about self-control . 
  i consider the tgv one of the most notable things about france . 
  nowhere else have i seen a more efficient form of transport . 
  the downside may be , that the local rail lines have very old rolling stock . 
  the recent decission to delay the expansion of the lgv net may be a pitty , but the local rail lines , which are supossed to receive funds that were originally planned for the lgv-expansion realy need an overhaul . 
  another interessting transport-related issue about france is the number of newly built tramway networks . 
  other noticeworthy issues are the secular culture and the position that philosophy holds in the public discourse . 
  `` wartime leader '' is an understatement . 
  this person , miklos horthy , was an autoritarian ruler with close ties to hitler . 
  the errection of this statue is not really surprising , as horthy is subject of a revisionism of the right parties including fidesz . 
  hailing him is the daily business of the jobbik party , who is behind this action . 
  the noteworthy thing is , that the hungarian reformed church and in this case its priest lorant heged\u00fcs , an antisemitic activist who is married to a jobbik local parliament mp , seem to have errected this statue as a joint action . 
  [ pictures of this event can be seen here . 
  only vehicles . 
  as far as i know , it is only possible to subject physical assets to this financial trick . 
  numerous vehicles were subject to a crossboarder leasing deal . 
  newly bought vehicles would not be subject to that deal , unless the town would decide to make something similar with them . 
  you may be able to choose the provide , but the electricity you get is the same your neighbour gets . 
  ** austria ** * the oligarchist party `` team stronach '' ( ts ) continues to fall appart . 
  the former director of the public broadcasting station orf , monika lindner , who was elected as an mp for that party has officialy left the party and become an independent mp . 
  in the meantime , a foundation for the support of the research of chancer in children has fired lindner from her chair position because she is suspected of having given contracts to her friends under dubious circumstances . 
  the subdivision of ts in the federal state of carinthia has lost one of its members because the head of the subdivision was having an affair with his wife . 
  with the loss of one of its mps , ts has fallen under the 4 mp threeshold in the carinthian local parliament , causing it to loose most of its party subsidies . 
  * the social democrats and the peoples party continue negotiations to form a new government . 
  rumours claim , that the minister of finances , [ maria fekter ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_fekter ) will not be a member of the next government . 
  fekter is not very popular . 
  she caused irritations when she spread rumors about the esm just before it was to be announced . 
  when jean claude juncker criticized her for doing so , she shrugged off his cricitism and claimed that he was just angry because he had kidney stones . 
  * a homeless shelter in linz has declared that it will not be able to accomodate `` some groups from eastern european countries '' due to their agressive behaviour . 
  left activists accused the operator , the catholic church , of beeing racist . 
  in the meantime , that very group continues to use child beggars around the main station . 
  * the town of vienna is going to buy 150 new tramways , that will replace the last non-low-floor tramways . 
  there are already 300 low floor tramways called [ `` ulf '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultra_low_floor ) , but they are not very popular because they are noisy and have a narrow passenger space . 
  the financial controll commision of the town criticized the ulf for having low reliability rates and a series of mysterious fires that seems to be related to a strange engine design . 
  originally , the town wanted to buy 150 more ulf from siemens - which has ties to the town - , but bombardier may have made a threat to fight another ulf-purchase without a tender in court . 
  the public seems to be in favour of the [ bombardier flexity outlook ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flexity_outlook ) ( [ picture ] ( http://www.viennaslide.com/p/0520-france/marseille/2006-10-02_transfer_bombardier-zw_30.jpg ) ) . 
  * vienna also has a new pedestrian area in the mariahilfer strasse , austrias most frequented shopping street . 
  conservatives and car fanatics continue to rally against it . 
  originally , a part of the bus line 13a was to run through the pedestrian area . 
  for some reason , the bus drivers union found this to be inacceptable .
