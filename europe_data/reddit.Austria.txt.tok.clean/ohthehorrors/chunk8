  the sidestreets are mostly one way streets , which makes finding a new route difficult . 
  the original plan was to run the bus in both directions through the neubaugasse . 
  this was opposed by the owners of some shops , as under the new plan , starbucks and 3 other restaurants would not have been able to have tables on the streets . 
  for some reasons , the town decided to listen to those people and is now going to send the bus through a labyrinth of narrow one way-streets . 
  as this will increase travel times on one of the most overcroded bus routes , passengers are furious . 
  * west-east rail traffic is blocked between innsbruck and salzburg . 
  the main line is blocked due to construction works and the diversion route is blocked by a derailed freight train . 
  the problem with a private ownership is , that the private owner is under the pressure to not only be profitable but to be more profitable than other possible investments . 
  infrastructures tend to have very long return of investment which leads private opperators to finding ways to increase their profit . 
  this can be done by raising prices or reducing maintenance costs by reducing maintenance . 
  while private operators can sometimes underbid a public operator , this does not mean , that they are better at their job . 
  there have been numerous cases in which infrastructures were cashed out by private owners until they were getting disfunctional due to the lack of costly maintenance . 
  one example of this are the estonian railways . 
  the were privatized , but after the private owners were driving them into disfunctionality , they had to be renationalized . 
  right this . 
  the basic income was a very neoliberal idea that somehow got support of left circles . 
  the idea behind it is , that it is wrong to subsidize certain groups weather they need support or not . 
  in the friedmaniverse , it seems to be a logical argument that if money is spent by the public , it should be spend like with a watering can so everyone gets the same share . 
  the basic income has several problematic points . 
  it seems to be unfinancable and it would cause a rise in labour costs because it reduces the available workforce . 
  this and a an increasing demand due to the rising purchasing power would would cause a general rise in prices that would equalize the basic income , making it useless . 
  the financial problem has often been answered by supporters of this idea wanting to replace the social system with the basic income , but this would cause some groups to fall out of society . 
  appart from this practical reason , public fund should be used efficiently to create the largest possible benefit . 
  spending money on unemployed people prevents them from loosing everything . 
  as homeless people are not as likely to get into a sustainable existence again , the public supports the unemployed as the costs of this support are cheaper than the costs of not supporting them . 
  the basic income would abandon the social system , that may not work perfect in every aspect with a laissez-faire motivated system , that would have severe socioeconomical consequences . 
  while an economic breakdown of the us would also harm the european economy , it would cause an flight into the euro causing it to get stronger . 
  this would mean , that the external power of purchase would strongly rise and that the ecb would get the chance to flood the markets with curency in order to counteract . 
  that beeing said , this bitching about the euro is getting annoying . 
  the other currency of global relevance is held by a nation that could be willingly driven into economic collapse by weird conservatives for their strange agenda . 
  given this context , the problems of the euro zone are quite harmless . 
  the scheme of some rich guy buying a party usually has two purposes . 
  one would be to get influence in order to push an agenda that benefits the party owners interests , just as berlusconi did . 
  the other one would be to operate the party as an investment . 
  the `` owner '' buys an informal bond that the party has to pay back using subsidies that were originally meant to be used for political activity . 
  stronachs party is a blatant example of this tactic . 
  all these parties - forza italia , ano 11 , team stronach etc. 
  - seem to use the same wording in their programmes . 
  they all talk about generall efficiency , privilegues , corruption and `` running the state like a company '' without making any detailed points . 
  tramways and rers/urban railway lines serve very different purposes . 
  trams can distribute a high passenger frequence on a local level . 
  rers are used to to connect the peripherical areas to interchange nodes or interchange nodes to interchange nodes . 
  trams are able to use space much more efficient and in contrast to cars , they neither cause pollution nor noise . 
  spaces are scarce means in towns . 
  i can not see the problem with reducing the space , that is given to cars - a form of mobility that drags the quality of living in cities so far down - in order to to increase the quality of living . 
  if we look at photos from the beginning of the last century , we can see , that streets offered more than 10 % of the space to pedestrians , there used to be more green , urban spaces were designed to be used , not to be passed or occupied by one ton of metal per 10 m \u00b2 . 
  in the case of paris , the modal split indicates , that cars are only used for 6 % of the ways in the town . 
  80 % of the street spaces are given to 6 % of the total traffic . 
  it is a small growth . 
  there are indications that point out to a slow recovery or at least a stop of the decline . 
  in august , there were [ fewer people unemployed ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/03/us-spain-economy-jobless-idusbre98206t20130903 ) than in july . 
  the very strange thing about spain is , that before 2008 , it was presented as an example for a working economy with the public budget actually reaching a surplus . 
  in austria , this tax has to be paid to the ( recognized ) relicious group the taxpayer is a member of . 
  it is possible to opt out of that group , raising the tax for that person . 
  appart from this tax , various federal and state funds get directed to the churches . 
  the public also pays for the teachers who teach the students in their religions in schools . 
  it is strange to see , that the conservatives caused the worst economical crisis since 1930 while the left are unable to counteract and profit . 
  on the other hand , we have to see a conservative majority in the ep , which keeps pushing their agenda , making the eu unpopular and thereby fueling the anti-eu-parties . 
  i live in major town , my door opens to a staircase , which itself can only be acessed by the buildings door , which should only be accesible with a key . 
  if somebody rings my door bell , he could be either standing in front of the buildings door or in front of my door . 
  if i can not see anyone through my door spy , i will try to perceive any auditive activity through the house telephone , which connects to a speaking facility at the door and decide my reaction . 
  if i can see someone through the doorspy , i will decide what to do at the spot i will open the door , if i happen to know the person or if the person looks harmless . 
  if something seems suspicious , i will remain quiet and do nothing . 
  i also expect someone , who rings my doorbell to explain themselfes before i do anything . 
  if someone rings the bell down at the building entrance , it is usually the mailman with a parcel . 
  the problem with opening the door is , that it could give someone a swift entrance , who should not be within my grounds . 
  there are hobos , scammers and crazy people walking around , i see them on the streets , not often , but it happens . 
  i expect people , who did not announce themselfes to use the bell at the building entrance . 
  people who do not live in the building should not even get into the staircase without beeing let in . 
  i am not a fan of terms like `` birthright lottery '' for two reasons . 
  the first one is , that our cognitive features are not independent from our biological aspects and therefore our genetics . 
  an individual with this identity could have only born as the combination of its parents . 
  the claim , that the very same individual could have been born anywhere else may not be accurate . 
  the second reason is , that the standards of civilisation in the western world does not result from nothing . 
  we have learned , that we may not hate or kill each other . 
  just look at the last time this was tried , the whole continent was severly damaged . 
  10 days would be barely enough for a single one of these destinations . 
  for that route , i would recommend starting at prague , then going to vienna and then to budapest by train . 
  cd and \u00d6bb will start a connection between prague , vienna and graz using railjets in december . 
  ** austria ** * after last weeks elections , a coalition between the social democrats and the conservative peoples party is likely . 
  * frank stronach , whose party got 5 % in the elections is thinking of disolving the local parts of his party because they `` make to little ** revenues ** '' . 
  he is also arranging a plan for his party to pay back his investment . 
  it seems , as if stronach wanted to create an enterprise , camouflaged as a party . 
  the subsidies for this party , which are meant to be used to fund political activity are probably expected to be payed out as a dividend by stronach . 
  this seems to be one of the worst cases of oligarchy in austrian history . 
  i have never understood , why people would wear dresses which were common in rural areas of the 19th century , and go on a bingedrinking event . 
  what is the idea behind this mixture of alcoholism and conservativism ? 
  the economical issues of greece may have been affected by a unique centralisation towards athens . 
  a few years ago , it was stated that more than half of the greek population lives in athens . 
  the problem with such large cities is , that they tend to rely on the third sector . 
  i am wondering if those , who migrated to athens within the last 30 years would have a better economical perspective , if they would have remained in rural areas , where they could grow food or try to find work in the agricultural sector . 
  the state government , consisting of sp\u00d6 and \u00d6vp merged some smaller communities in order to save costs in the administrative apparatus . 
  some local politicans of sp\u00d6 and \u00d6vp started a protest campaign , calling for not voting for their parties . 
  apparently , people followed their `` advice '' . 
  its actually like : for vienna , the party x has this list of several candidates . 
  this list will fill the mandates this party gets in the order they were positioned on this list . 
  you can give one candidate of this list a bonus . 
  if he gets enough bonus votes , he will get ranked up in this list and get a better position that will make it more likely to get a mandate . 
  the neos are neoliberal , not liberal by the means of society and civil matters . 
  we should also note , that the fp\u00d6 could only gain 1/3rd of the bz\u00d6s losses back .
