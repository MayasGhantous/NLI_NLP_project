  the bz\u00d6 ran as `` liste j\u00f6rg haider - bz\u00d6 '' in the elections in 2008 . 
  this would have been the fp\u00d6s core group . 
  according to the standard : sp\u00d6 26 , 4 % \u00d6vp 23,8 % fp\u00d6 22,4 % gr\u00fcne 11,2 % team stronach 6,0 % neos 4,7 % bz\u00d6 3,7 %, 
  at [neuwal.com ] ( http://neuwal.com/ ) . 
  i am speaking about polls , not exit polls . 
  the parties have national lists and more local lists . 
  it is not one constituency , one candidate . 
  more like on constituency , one list . 
  the latest polls expect the social democratic party ( sp\u00d6 ) to win with ~ 27 % . 
  the conservative \u00d6vp will likely get around 23 % . 
  the right extremist fp\u00d6 may get up to 20 % , the greens will get up to 14 % , the new party of billionaire frank stronach , ts , will get 6 % . 
  the neoliberal parties bz\u00d6 and neos will likely not get over the 4 % requirred to get into the parliament , communists and pirates will stay around 1 % . 
  the big question is , if \u00d6vp and sp\u00d6 will have enough seats in the parliament to form a coalition . 
  if not , there will be a coalition of 3 parties . 
  this could either be sp\u00d6-\u00d6vp-greens , or something terrible between the conservatives , the greens or the right extremists and stronach . 
  there have been people hopping for the sp\u00d6 an \u00d6vp to miss the majority together , but those people may not mind , that the alternatives are a opposition , that only consists of neoliberals and right-extremists or a coalition , that consists of neoliberals and right-extremists . 
  the grand coalition may not be a good solution , but it is certainly not bad . 
  i have made the decision to vote against the right parties . 
  therefore , i voted for the sp\u00d6 . 
  my reason is not , that i would have a great preference for this party . 
  the sp\u00d6 has the mayor of my town - the 3rd largest in austria - , i hate this person for beeing a dictator who wants to crush the town under motorways . 
  on a local leve , i would vote for the greens . 
  however , on the national leve , the greens , which i voted for in the last elections have turned conservative . 
  them supporting useless motorways and are against new railway lines . 
  in the state of salzburg , they even formed a coalition with the \u00d6vp and stronach . 
  the sp\u00d6 did not perform that good , but it is the only party , that does not stand for a right-neoliberal agenda . 
  some positions of the social democrats are quite good , they are pro tax-the-rich and against tution fees . 
  additional sympathy points go the sp\u00d6 , because it is the only party in austrian history , that did not persecute and murder its political opponents , while in power . 
  only one vote , but we can express a preference vote for a candidate of the party we give the vote . 
  if enough people give a candidate a preference vote , he gets a higher place in the parties list and may get into the parliament easier . 
  4 % are necessary for entering the parliament . 
  ** austria ** * ** elections for the national pariament are held today ** there is a [ thread for discussion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nd1k2/austrian_election_thread/ ) . 
  i would add , that the bz\u00d6 and the neos are economically liberal , not civil liberal . 
  i would actually call them neoliberals . 
   gambled with tax money on the financial markets and lost 340 million euro in salzburg you know , that the \u00d6vp started that stuff and controlled the important administrative departments ? 
  regarding \u00d6vp , fp\u00d6 and bz\u00d6 , there numerous are other things like the privatisation of the buwog , a housing company for much less than it was worth , the telekom-trial has resulted in the first sentences , the eurofighters etc. 
  not to mention even the smaller cases . 
  who remembers hella ranner or otto gumpinger , a member of the regional parliament of upper austria who was sentenced for human trafficking . 
  the greek justice system and the administrative apparatus seem to get effectifve . 
  germany is still struggling with forbiding its nazi-party , the austrian nazi-party will get 20 % in the elections tomorrow , but here we can see democracy defending against its enemies . 
   be careful what you hope for . 
  i would not be that sure , that if italy was turned into a monarchy , berlusconi would not be elected as a king . 
  however , even if juan carlos may not be the optimal solution ( appart from his actions during the 23-f coup-de-etat attempt ) , in contrast to berlusconi , he looks like a figure of wisdom and rationality . 
  berlusconi illustrates the weaknesses of democracy , i can understand sympathies for monarchies comming up while looking at the mess he creates . 
  the biological solution for berlusconi may not take a long time to get into effect . 
  better public transport . 
  parts of the railway line from the largest to the second largest city were not really modernized ( apart from the electrification ) since they were built in 1854 . 
  local railway lines are quite slow in most cases . 
  in vienna , the public transports system is very usable , but in smaller towns wit 100.000-200 .000 inhabitants , it gets difficult . 
  i would call this a partial return . 
  cities have became an living space for several species , but at least in austria , the return of large mammals is not happening . 
  there was a bear population , but it was subsequently killed by hunters . 
  in one case , a suspect was found , but for some reason , he was not sentenced . 
  the same thing is happening to lynxes . 
  a few weeks ago a lynx and her pup were found poisoned . 
  similar things have happened to sea eagles and other protected bird species . 
  it is always funny to see nationalists trying to cooperate on a national level . 
  it never works . 
  they tried to found a fraction in the european parliament , but it ended with them not beeing able to deal with each other . 
  the last districts are beeing counted at this moment , but it seems sure to say that the fdp and the afd are both out . 
  the fdp got close to the 5 % - mark at midnight , but it has dropped to 4,8 % now . 
  does anyone if votes by mail will be counted later ? 
  the mariahilferstra\u00dfe consists of two parts . 
  one pedestrian area and one area with traffic restrictions . 
  it was originally planned to have a pedestrian area from the ring to the g\u00fcrtel . 
  after the conservatives complained , only a small part of the street was turned into a pedestrian area , while the rest saw traffic restrictions . 
  the very special idea for this part was to allow the pedestrians to use the former street by abolishing the separation between street and sidewalkds . 
  i am sceptical about this , as in other cities where this model was installed , the cars pushed the pedestrians to the sides of the street . 
  now , there are 2 groups , who complain about the current state . 
  one group wants the whole street to be turned into a pedestrian area , the other group consists of about 50-100 people who complain about not beeing able to drive there with their cars . 
  at the moment , it seems as if the part with the pedestrian area will be extended . 
  it was obvious for years , that this street would need to be turned into a pedestrian area . 
  the sidewalks were overcrowded during the day . 
  the conservatives claim the current state to be a disaster , but i have been there and i ca n't really see the problem . 
  the fp\u00d6 lost its stronghold , the state of carinthia , earlier this year after a corruption affair and early elections . 
  they are not expected to regain from these losses in carinthia . 
  at the moment , the seem to be very equaly spread around the country . 
  these 20 % seem to be the basis the can be reached with a right-extremist , populist course . 
  these 20 % will vote for the fp\u00d6 , regardless of what will happen . 
  within the last months , numerous corruption affairs involving the fp\u00d6 became public . 
  earlier this year , the fp\u00d6-led state government of carynthia was deelected after some of its members were sentenced for corruption . 
  two weeks ago , the fp\u00d6 was sentenced to pay back 900.000 $ to the nationalized telekom austria , from which they took this amount of moneys in an obscure act of illegal party financing . 
  the 20 % , which will vote for the fp\u00d6 may be the results of the failures of our education system . 
  as far as i know , tsipras spoke english . 
  the \u00df < -  ss - issue is a bit ambivalent , but officially it is used in austria . 
  swiss and liechtenstein do n't use it . 
  ** austria ** * elections for the parliament will be held in one week . 
  billionaire frank stronach and his party continue to confuse the nation . 
  in his debate with the green leading candidate , he blamed her for a misconduct as a waitress in her parents restaurant . 
  as a youth , the green candidate would take back vine when people complained about it , but she would pour it into another glass and serve it again . 
  according to her , most people very pleased with the vine afterwards . 
  stronach repeated this single issue for 10 minutes in order to show her lack of virtue and values . 
  in the meantime , stronach is accused of having bought a castle for a very low price . 
  it seems as if he broke the conditions of the sale contract and sold it for a much higher price to someone else . 
  the right-extremist candidate has published [ the second terrible song in this campaign ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8awgt7dlay0&amp;feature=share ) . 
  this hate-preachers first campaign song has the title [ love is the way ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evm6pn1pnlc ) . 
  * actual election forecasts expect the social democrats ( sp\u00d6 ) to receive 27 % of the votes , the conservative peoples parties ( \u00d6vp ) are expected to receive 23 % , the right-extremist fp\u00d6 will receive 19-20 % , the greens may get 14 % , and the stronach-party may get 6-7 % . 
  it is unlikely , that the neoliberal parties bz\u00d6 und neos will get into the parliament . 
  * the conservative peoples party ( \u00d6vp ) is prosposing a tax reform that would benefit people with higher incomes due to allowing high tax deducations . 
  the social democrats prosposed lowering the first and probably also the second tax rate , which would benefit the lower incomes ( austria has a progressive tax system ) .
