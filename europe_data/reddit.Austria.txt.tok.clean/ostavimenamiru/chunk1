the us by far . 
  mostly `` trump says stupid thing '' . 
  i cited the total revenue and the total expenditure , you cherry-picked subpoints that happen to support your point of view . 
  no , that 's why i specified v4 . 
  of course !, 
  [ here ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm ) is an interactive tool . 
  poland , for example , paid ~ $ 543,000,000 and received $ 13,357,000,000 . 
  the 2004 enlargement was the eu 's biggest mistake to date and will eventually break its neck . 
  with v4 , we have countries that are huge net receivers yet ca n't be bothered to help when there 's a problem , blame the eu for everything that 's wrong and are in the process of straying away from democracy . 
  there are people who support it , but you wo n't find many of them on askeurope . 
  they have their own subreddits where they are having a nice little circlejerk about whatever 's the latest crime committed by a refugee and occasionally brigade threads about immigration on other subs . 
  in real life , they also form pretty secluded groups , you might have heard about the identitarian movement and their ship trying to stop the rescue of refugees and migrants in the mediterranean . 
  there now is a rather strong anti-refugee and - immagration sentiment in europe , but few go as far as supporting ideas like `` white genocide '' . 
  if austria had somehow kept its pre-ww1 size , we 'd probably be meddling in foreign affairs and starting wars everywhere like the us does today , so i think being small and rather i significant is a good thing . 
  thanks , gavrilo !, 
  finnish sounds awesome . 
  a close second are the slavic languages , especially those from the south . 
  i just ca n't get into romance or scandinavian ones . 
  same with rural austrians and cartographers from the cities . 
  the villagers were fed up with constantly being asked what this and that region are called , so they started telling the cartographers bullshit who did n't question it . 
  there are lots of obscenely named places on our mountains ( asshole ridge , swine alp etc. ), 
  good bot, 
  it has theft-resistant street signs . 
  thanks again !, 
  thanks for the corrections , greatly appreciated !, 
  are the ways i phrased my first sentence ( up to the hyphen ) strictly wrong or do yours just sound better and more natural ? 
  is croatian/serbian/bosnian exotic enough ? 
  it definitely is uncommon to learn it around here ( beyond `` vacation croatian '' , that is ) . 
  why : i want to become a translator and just ca n't stand romance languages , so i looked around some slavic ones and immediately fell in love . 
  it 's pretty hard , there are a lot of concepts that are unfamiliar to german speakers ( e.g. 
  more cases ) and it 's extremely inflectional . 
   i think there 's a similar word in german . 
  `` but muh diversity '' coming from a brit ? 
  maybe nobody in your social circles , but tons of old people and people from rural austria ( carinthia ... ) still believe that we were annexed by force rathe than opened the borders and cheered . 
  i wish austria had dealt with its past as well as germany . 
  even today many people say that we were the first victims . 
  `` questionable government '' extends far beyond trump . 
  downvoted for stating that his friends are right-leaning . 
  serbia ranks second only to the us in gun ownership per capita . 
  it really is a cultural problem rather than a gun problem . 
  the conflict around the republika srpska is heating up , i 'd argue they 're getting started again , not calming down . 
  [ no english articles ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaspresskn%c3%b6del ) to be found . 
  that sounds like every other pop song , so yes . 
  @polish brigade : care to reply to my comment ? 
  downvotes alone wo n't help me see what 's wrong with my comment . 
  and poland was one of the biggest supporters of the coalition of the willing , they 're basically fucking over the same people a second time . 
  gregg 's was the highlight of our school trip 5-ish years ago . 
  so good and cheap ( for british price levels , anyway ) . 
  our green party has become `` special '' since their former head and our current president left them ... 
  they are in the process of kicking out all men , do n't care about environmentalism anymore and generally shoot themselves in the foot every few days . 
  hence i most agree with the social democrats , i especially like christian kern ( current chancellor ) . 
  he has something very calm , unifying and reasonable about him , exactly what we need in times like these when the eu is threatening to break apart etc. 
  `` moor brew '' the english version is right there , you could have just looked it up ... 
  it 's an archaic term for `` black person '' , like `` negro '' but less offensive . 
  `` body odour '' , i think ? 
  `` moor brew '' ) gets sued from time to time because of their name and logo . 
  it 's perfectly fine imo because it was established long before `` mohr '' got out of fashion . 
  usually all interior doors can be locked . 
   it 's not even proven that this study has been edited . 
  of course it is . 
  kurz himself claimed that aslan ( the researcher kurz comissioned to make the study for those who do n't know ) has agreed to all the changes . 
  [ ^ 1 ] ( http://derstandard.at/2000060925850/kurz-studie-zu-islam-kindergaerten-auf-punkt-und-beistrich-von ) aslan however said beforehand that he does n't know what 's going on and that he does n't have a good feeling about this . 
  `` er ( aslan ; anm . ), 
  * and claiming that kurz is moderate and not populistic is just ridiculous . 
  his election programme so far consists of nothing but `` no marriage for homosexuals and closed borders ( he cited australia 's inhumane island detention method as a good role model again a few days ago [ ^ 3 ] ( http://orf.at/stories/2398325/ ) . '' . 
  the only difference between kurz and other \u00d6vp politicians is that he is fairly young , which seems to be enough to trick lots of people into thinking that the `` new '' \u00d6vp is more progressive and moderate - if you ask me , it 's even worse than before in that respect . 
   my maths isnt so good . 
  i want to study economy - business or software developing a huge part of informatics/programming etc. 
  at university is very advanced mathematics . 
  a friend 's currently studying it and it 's tough . 
  sebastian kurz , the new head of our people 's party and currently running for chancellor . 
  he 's la ruthless power politician who , as the * minister for integration * , had a study about islamic daycares edited by his ministry to better fit his anti-immigration agenda . 
  i 'm not for religious daycares at all and working with refugees and `` refugees '' has made me somewhat anti-immigration , but politicians ca n't just mess around with research to make it more valuable to their goals . 
  [ english article ] ( https://www.google.at/amp/abcnews.go.com/amp/international/wirestory/austria-muslim-kindergarten-study-reviewed-text-48451984 ), 
  damn , you 're lucky . 
  it 's the only topic here in austria . 
  the guy leading the polls does n't even have any plans except for `` close the borders '' yet , but is already comfortably ahead . 
   sadly are you sure about that ? 
  the world has n't been this unstable for a long time . 
  blind hate and stupidity everywhere again , something awful is just around the corner . 
  anyway : about 1960 . 
  we were about done rebuilding austria and i 'd live in basically constant economic growth until my death . 
  the most extreme ones : [ unzensuriert.at ] ( https://www.unzensuriert.at/einzelfall ) ( link leads to their `` daily isolated case '' section ) and formerly alpen-donau . info , which was banned and the owners prosecuted for doing * really * nasty shit like leaking a few key witnesses ' personal details to their readers ( a bunch of skinheads ) . 
  summers ( and revently springs ) are way too hot . 
  anything above ~ 22 \u00b0 is absolutely unbearable since there 's never any wind in my town ( completely enclosed by mountains ) . 
  ideal would be a rotation between autumn and winter . 
  not guilt , but the responsibility to never let it happen again . 
  you can own them here if you have them modified to work like a bolt-action rifle . 
  yeah , this turned out so well for the austrian empire ... 
  why did you list kajkavian seperate from croatian ? 
  is it so different from its other dialects ? 
  you joined quite a while ago . 
  poland and hungary becoming pre-fascist was n't really foreseeable back then . 
  they want all the benefits of the eu without having to lift a finger . 
  the 50 % blue , 50 % macedonian one looks quite nice . 
  i think that 's arizona ? 
   and before putin became president yet again , many people saw russia as a democracy . 
  our far/extreme right still sees russia as a paradise of free speech and democracy for some reason . 
  the refugee crisis really has brought to light what lots of countries seem to think to eu is all about , which can be seen nicely in this thread : leeching off germany , france and other `` big boys '' without getting your hands dirty . 
  yes , they should be punished , * especially * those who were part of the coalition of the willing and helped create this mess in the first place .
