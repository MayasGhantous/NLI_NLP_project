  austria is n't part of nato and we did n't send troops to iraq , yet we help those in need because it 's the right thing to do . 
  those primarily responsible for this crisis are now fucking the same people over a second time . 
  this did n't have to be a refugee * crisis * , the reluctance of many countries to accept refugees , thus overcrowding others , has made it into one . 
  had the burden been spread equally among member states , we would have merely had a refugee problem . 
  but they 're still a subset of protestantism and i just used the wrong word , right ? 
   from your link :   '' ... martin luther referred to the evangelische kirche ( `` evangelical church '' ) ... '' note that `` evangelical '' is n't capitalised here . 
  this means it 's used as * pertaining to the gospel * rather than the * evangelical * movement . 
  a few lines further down :  christian historian david bebbington writes that , `` although ` evangelical ' , with a lower-case initial , is occasionally used to mean ` of the gospel ' , the term ` evangelical ' , with a capital letter , is applied to any aspect of the movement beginning in the 1730s . '', 
  also , you ignored these further up the article :  evangelical protestantism [ a ] is a worldwide , transdenominational movement within protestant christianity and  evangelicalism , a major part of popular protestantism, 
  there is a distinction . 
  [ evangelicanism is a movement within protestantism ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/evangelicalism ), 
  we do , but it 's a false friend . 
  protestant = evangelisch evangelical = [ evangelikal ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/evangelikalismus ), 
  you mean protestants . 
  evangelicals are a branch of protestants in the usa and worlds apart ( not in a good way ) from our protestants over here . 
  horrible . 
  i hear , read and write english every day but never get to speak it . 
  it 's not because the words do n't come to my mind quickly enough , it 's the pronunciation - `` th '' trips me up like mad . 
  if it occurs in a word , i 'll completely butcher the whole thing ( i seem to mentally prepare for the `` th '' and replace consonants that come before it with it , so `` absinthe '' would sometimes become `` abthinthe '' , for example . 
  [ info sheet here , in german ] ( http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/bmi_zivilschutz/skkm/warnung/files/020_warn_und_alarmsignale.pdf ) 3 minutes of uninterrupted sound | warning , nearing danger , turn on radio -- | -- 1 minute of wailing | immediate danger , get to safety 1 minute of uninterrupted sound | all clear 15 seconds of wailing at noon each saturday | siren test 3 x 5 seconds of siren | warning to nearby fire brigades that\u017ds basically it . 
  there 's even an allemannic version, 
  a fair share is saying `` they 're already here , so let 's spread the burden evenly among member states . '' . 
  the eu is about working together and not about leeching off of germany . 
  apparently i 'd fit right into the deep south / bible belt area ? 
  must be because i checked `` have no word for this '' so often / s i only ever had british english at school , which seems to me like the southern accent 's polar opposite . 
  depends on the owner . 
  it ranges from `` brav ! '', 
  ( `` good ! '' ), 
  over `` ja super , feiner hund ! '', 
  ( well done , good dog ! '' ), 
  ( `` who 's a good doggy aww come here aww such a good doggy so good widdy widdy widdy ... ! '', 
  - you get the idea , basically just random syllables mixed in among compliments , this typically goes on for half a minute . 
  they left even though they had privileges over other countries , so no special treatment this time . 
  did you mean to reply to / u/gaguja ? 
  yeah , that 's exactly like the fp\u00d6 . 
  news about stuff like that usually makes it into the newspapers over here , but there 's little news about the svp - i just assumed they were like our \u00d6vp ( centre-right ) with an extra dose of populism . 
  i neither invented the schnitzel nor laid hand on any gas valves , i have literally nothing in common with the people who did except for being born in roughly the same region . 
  i do n't understand nationalism . 
  but imo today 's nationalism in europe is less about deifying your country rather than a vessel for your hatred of islam and foreigners . 
  [ the svp 's logo ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/de/thumb/3/32/svp.svg/602px-svp.svg.png ) cracks me up everytime i see it , it 's so ridiculously unprofessional . 
  but are they really as bad as the fp\u00d6 ( blatantly racist , little in the way of conversation manners etc. 
  implying the eu will not have been destroyed by the resurgence of nationalism by then ... 
  my plan is to become a freelancer and live in the countryside once i 'm done studying , otherwise i 'd be working just to pay rent , basically . 
  but why ? 
  just to make croatian less similar to serbian ? 
  palatschinken . 
  a dyslexic german ? 
  nah , the tablecloth pattern looks great imo . 
  it 's unique . 
  you 'll love our plural form of `` pizza '' !, 
  it 's `` pizzen '' ( german plural on top of `` pizze '' ) because `` pizze '' is n't enough , apparently . 
  at least we do n't eat schnitzel with tunke . 
  it 's clear in spoken german . 
  stress on um = run over , stress on fahren = circumnavigate . 
  [ only english site about them i found ] ( http://www.tourmycountry.com/austria/kaspressknoedel.htm ), 
  serbian/croatian/bosnian ( i 've learned the hard way to not call it serbocroatian ) for university . 
   does anything dealing with the us automatically = bad in europe not at all , but this shit ( quote from wikipedia ) :  musk has described himself as `` nauseatingly pro-american . '', 
  according to musk , the united states is '' [ inarguably ] the greatest country that has ever existed on earth , '' describing it as `` the greatest force for good of any country that 's ever been . '', 
  musk believes outright that there `` would not be democracy in the world if not for the united states , '' arguing there were `` three separate occasions in the 20th-century where democracy would have fallen with world war i , world war ii and the cold war , if not for the united states . '', 
  is just ridiculously nationalistic . 
  self-described american exceptionalists do n't do well here . 
  the cars are irrelevant to anyone but the rich . 
  this time we wo n't start it for a change . 
  wo n't be long now , do n't worry . 
  that 's about right . 
  very harsh `` ch '' , short `` oo '' . 
  [ wrong !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/berlin,_new_hampshire ), 
  i quite liked it ( the very first one at least ) . 
  did n't take itself seriously and was pretty funny . 
  i do n't know anyone who uses twitter and is n't a politian/newscaster etc. 
  i speak german and english fluently , spoke italian quite well but forgot everything because i 'm not interested in italy and am currently learning serbian/croatian/bosnian for university and since i 'm actually interested in those countries ' cultures . 
  i live in conchita 's country and have n't heard from him in years . 
  he might not even be making music anymore for all i know . 
  was n't / r/europe a bastion of the alt-right a few months ago ? 
  that 's patriotism, 
  the brand new testament was belgian , right ? 
  it was n't badly made , but so infuriatingly pretentious ... 
  strache held a speech in south tyrol a while ago and suggested a referendum and hofer said `` south tyroleans , your home is austria ! '', 
  last year . 
  middle income . 
  i have carinthian relatives . 
  for many : hitler . 
  lots of remarks like `` i wish we had a strong guy at the front again , he 'd take care of the refugees '' , the classic `` unterm hitler h\u00e4tt 's das nicht geben ! '', 
  ( would n't have happened under hitler 's rule ) etc. 
  given the rise in nationalism and the fact that people actively search for something to hate on , my answer is `` a few years time . 
  it was a joke . 
  usa ? 
  huh ? 
  what ? 
  global warming . 
  who ? 
  the maniacs out to destroy the greatest peace project ever . 
  when the eu has breathed its dying breaths , we will remember the old enemies across the new borders and blood will be shed again . 
  europe seems to be the continent that is least capable of learning from history , people like hofer , le pen and wilders personify that inability . 
  grammar-wise , it 's an extremely easy language , but the pronunciation is just a mess . 
  [ i mean , come on !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/tfrsvtsy0d4 ), 
  your `` r '' is more like an `` uuhhhh '' . 
  a proper german `` r '' sounds like the speaker 's throat has just been slit .
