it always seems like there are only 50 different voice actors . 
  i 've heard everyone 's voice featured in the clip somewhere before . 
  those graphs are horribly normalized . 
  sweden 's bars with about 2.300 immigrants per 100.000 capita are lower than austria 's and hungary 's with 1.200 and 1.300 immigrants per capita . 
  i tried asking reddit historians once but nobody answered : how is the situation in the areas which were annexed by poland after ww ii ? 
  how is it in the polish areas annexed by russia ? 
  any kind of autonomy movement ?

  ** austria ** order by percentage ** sp\u00d6 : ** socialist democratic party , center-left . 
  represents mostly workers and their rights and social issues . 
  most popular in most cities , mildly popular everywhere else . 
  one of the oldest parties . 
  ** \u00d6vp : ** people party , center-right . 
  conservative party with great support from farmers and popular due to heavy investment programs . 
  christian-based and one of the oldest parties . 
  ** fp\u00d6 : ** liberal party , right . 
  started as a party for nazis but is n't that extreme anymore . 
  some members are still active in extreme right wing groups , though . 
  very anti-immigrant , anti-eu and pro-christian . 
  popular with low income workers and the youth . 
  every time they had been in power , heavy corruption occurred . 
  they act like they represent low income workers while looking for tax reductions for the rich . 
  ** green party : ** left wing . 
  their main topics are immigration , the environment , social problems and cannabis use . 
  only mildly popular due to some extreme positions and proposed tax increases . 
  ** team stronach : ** center . 
  liberal views and anti-eu . 
  not popular . 
  frank stronach , an austrian guy who made big money in canada , founded the party and now wants his invested money back from the party . 
  ** neos : ** center . 
  liberal views and strong support for direct democracy . 
  founded in 2013 . 
  alemannic german is the worst . 
  i ca n't understand a thing people from vorarlberg say . 
  sorry for that . 
  join austria , we will open-heartedly welcome you !, 
  most of us even speak the same dialect . 
  because we have nowhere to put them . 
  currently all asylum centers in austria are almost full . 
  the asylum centers in south european countries are overcrowded . 
  imagine what happens if you bring 100,000 refugees to a 20 million resident country . 
  1 in 200 people would have no language skills and would need food and shelter for at least a year or two . 
  who pays for the refugees ? 
  the already highly indebted european countries . 
  if they go back to their home country after the crisis , the investment made for refugees will have no positive effects for the country they spent their asylum in . 
  is n't not relying on credits the ideal situation for any country ? 
  the best situation i can imagine is every country having no debts at all and never taking out loans . 
  yes it is that place .

  you 're right , it 's roo-bull . 
  i 'd rather stay in my country as long as david cameron is trying to enforce his crazy internet politics . 
  austria is gray - they were n't asked . 
  just so you know , with 50 % votes for a right wing president and about 20 % in general elections for the right wing party 10 % would n't be too surprising .

  you 're right , he was just mocking the drink . 
  pl\u00f6rre = bad-tasting or watered down drink .

  \u0160pricer also has the same pronunciation as an austrian word , spritzer which means something mixed with sparkling water . 
  in austria the variant g'spritzter which is short for gespritzter is more common . 
  the word spritzen means to splash . 
  no that 's german beer on zeltfests where you have to drink 3 liters to be a bit drunk . 
  at least that was my experience 2 weeks ago in oberpfalz . 
   gemi\u0161t that 's literally the german word for mixed , gemischt . 
  sch is pronounced the same as \u0161 . 
  we austrians love to drink white wine mixed with sparkling water . 
  edit : it 's called spritzer , g'spritzter or schorle in the german area . 
  gemischt is used only in foreign countries but is a german word too . 
  fyi this is not an asylum seeker or recent migrant . 
  his german sounds like he 's second or third generation turkish or something similar . 
  the polls before the first round looked like this : [ poll 1 ] ( http://images.derstandard.at/2016/02/05/d68534e7-4bc7-4d62-a88a-c11ec899dce9_1.jpg ) [ poll 2 ] ( http://cdn.salzburg.com/nachrichten/uploads/pics/2016-04/orginal/kampf-um-die-hofburg-van-der-bellen-knapp-vor-hofer-41-63632203.jpg ) the actual results were [ this ] ( https://www.news.at/_storage/asset/6334957/storage/newsat:stage-xl/file/94324514/bundesprsidentenwahl-gesamtergebnis-mit-briefwahl.jpg ) . 
  as you can see hofer performed far better in the first round than anybody expected . 
  before the second and third round the polls were much closer to the actual results as they always showed about 50:50 + - 5 % . 
  i can only guess but i think it 's because everyone believed that their candidate would win and that the other candidate does not match their ideologies at all . 
  that is to be expected if the 2 candidates are either a leftist green party member or a far-right national party member . 
  hopefully it wo n't be like the austrian and us presidential election where the far right party got much more votes than the polls showed . 
  we barely managed to get a left president with 53.6 % . 
  `` do you guys in britain often have such thick fog ? '', 
  `` no , when it rains we do n't . '', 
  back in 2010 when the exchange rate of euro to rubel was about 1:30 i was in moscow for a week for a student exchange program . 
  the russian students told me to just leave the kopecks at the supermarkets . 
  i think it 's because of the existing magister title and a lack of need for universities after completing htls ( = higher technical education institute ) . 
  out of my secondary school class only a few have studied at universities because most went to a htl . 
  in my hak class more than 50 % have a bachelor 's degree . 
  ( hak = commercial highschool with a focus on business economics and accounting ), 
  i do n't think it will get better until the fp\u00d6 gets into the government , messes up big time like in the \u00d6vp / fp\u00d6 coalition and will be seen as a bad party again . 
  1999 : 26.91 % ( fp\u00d6 got into the government ) 2002 : 10.01 % ( fp\u00d6 left the government ) 2006 : 11.03 % 2008 : 17.54 % 2013 : 20.51 %, 
  the bad thing about using the euro in eastern countries is that a strong euro means that their people have to pay less for imported goods from outside the euro zone but exported goods are more expensive for non-euro countries . 
  it also means that their currency ca n't become weaker than the euro so the euro zone countries will import less . 
  goods from the eastern european countries are mostly bought because they are cheap and not because they are high quality . 
  germany does not really mind a strong euro because people still import german goods because of `` german quality '' and germans have to pay less for imported goods . 
  in an economy where most of the goods are imported and only little is exported this will sooner or later lead to a financial crisis like in greece since it increases the unemployment rate and thus decreases the amount of usable tax money . 
  i would say the fp\u00d6 consists mostly of conservative nationalists . 
  they are only social liberals when it affects austrians .
