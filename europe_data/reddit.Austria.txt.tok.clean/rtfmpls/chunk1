one church that was finished after 480 years ( iirc - with breaks ) , and the other one will have taken about 150 years when it 's done . 
  it 's still in vienna ( municipal area ) , but on the outskirts . 
  switzerland is good too . 
  vienna is really nice . 
  it has everything . 
  but it ca n't compete with it salaries in berlin , london and so on . 
  getting over 50k is quite the challenge :-d ( and then you pay have of it in taxes ) . 
  but life 's really cheap here . 
  so maybe i should account for that . 
  would be interesting to compare salaries with standards of living . 
  java vs javascript seems quite a difference to me . 
  is it not ? 
  are they really paying js devs 70k ? 
  i 'm doing js on the side when necessary ... am i doing something wrong :|, 
  contracting . 
  i 'm in vienna and the offers were for london . 
  i 'd try to contact consulting firms . 
  if you want to force your way to london , it 'd probably take a while until you know the right people to get the salary you 're aiming for . 
  but this is n't that out of the question . 
  of course speaking german or french would boost your possibilities immensely . 
  frankfurt , berlin , munich , paris ... these are all pretty good it areas . 
  vienna is a good start too ( and pretty chill :-d ) . 
  i would n't move to london below 1k $ a day . 
  and yeah , that is not that unusual ( i 've had offers for 500 + gbp ) . 
  of course that is crunch mode as / u/lgtm0 mentioned . 
  70k in hamburg is nice . 
  mind if i ask what the job was ( language ) ? 
  because the differences in languages is mind boggling sometimes . 
  and the financial industry pays reeeeeeheheheheheally good . 
  i 've heard that in london you ca n't find devs for what is considered a `` normal salary '' . 
  because a soon as someone has a name for himself , a bank will just pay him double the amount he earned before . 
  yes , they did this with all four of them . 
  and more walls . 
  already received an sms . 
  24c instead of 54c ... for ... a mb . 
  yes . 
  and my provider acts like this is some sort of achievement . 
  [ justice center leoben \\ ( austria \\ ) ] ( http://strafvollzug.justiz.gv.at/einrichtungen/justizanstalten/justizanstalt.php?id=18 ) [ picture of a cell ] ( http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/06/14/magazine/14prison2_500.jpg ) from a [ nyt article ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/14/magazine/14prisons-t.html?pagewanted=all ) . 
  it 's actually long overdue in austria too . 
  it just sounds politically incorrect ... people just hear `` let 's put poor people in jail '' when in fact begging is a business . 
  and those in charge are n't poor . 
  poor people who have the necessary requirements , get money and a home . 
  so there 's absolutely no reason to beg . 
  this message has been brought to you by the council supporting / u/jebusgobson and making everything less good . 
  `` yes , we ... no ... actually ... no we do n't want to . 
  and can not btw '', 
  so you do n't have sources ? 
  because that 's exactly what the opponents over here are doing . 
  lots of noise , no facts . 
   high numbers of girls being forced and you have a source for that too ? 
  statistics in germany and austria show the exact opposite . 
  just like with drug decriminalization . 
  and of course you have a source for that ? 
  like the bundeskriminalamt for example :  in 2009 , 710 victims of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation were discovered , an increase of 5 % in comparison with 2008 . 
  [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prostitution_in_germany#crime ) compare that to the total estimate of prostitutes in germany : 400 000 [ source ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26261221 ), 
  i expected it to be not that easy to be honest . 
  but it 's still ridiculous in my opinion :-) . 
  i did n't attribute the quote to a prostitute . 
  keep attacking that straw man . 
  and now an article about the us ? 
  where prostitution is almost completely illegal ? 
  i 'm out . 
   but are the downsides to being an unhappy accountant or salesman the same as being an unhappy prostitute ? 
  i do n't know . 
  but why do you want to make that decision for other people ? 
   between taking calls from clients , offering them a special price of ** 160 ** euros per girl per hour -- down from the usual 175 , snoep said the economic crisis had made a deep dent in his biggest client base -- travelling businessman . 
  and even the 50eur/client mentioned are n't that bad considering what you get as a non-skilled worker in the job market over here . 
  of course it was bad in 2009 when a lot of industries had problems with the crisis . 
  but you would have to compare that to people losing their jobs and in bad cases even their homes . 
  so posting this article as evidence that prostitutes do n't earn a lot of money is really dishonest in my opinion . 
  probably . 
  since there is lot and lots of money to be made , some may want to quit ( maybe because they want to have a family ) and do n't know if they can work a job for 1/10th of the money . 
  in my opinion the social stigma that goes with prostitution is way way worse than the actual job . 
  prostitutes are honorable members of a society . 
  they do the rest of us a great service and should be treated accordingly . 
  just like we look up to firemen , doctors , nurses , paramedics and so on . 
  if there were a correlation between the legality of prostitution and human trafficking , that would be an argument against it . 
  but there is n't . 
  and even staunch opponents of prostitution do n't deny that . 
  just to give you some insight of where i 'm coming from : in germany and austria the only opponents that are still advocating against it ( lead by alice schwarzer , a complete nut and of course the religious ) are actually outcasts . 
  it 's a loud minority that works with scare tactics , e.g. 
  mentioning human trafficking at every opportunity , do n't fall for it . 
  that there are people happily paying for sex . 
  and that , when you 're looking at germany for example , there are people happily receiving money for sex . 
  this prude and unrealistic approach some countries are trying is downright stupid . 
  btw . 
  what about porn ? 
  i 'd love to see if making pornos is prohibited in some of these countries . 
  because then it 's actually usa-level of stupid . 
  `` i ca n't pay you for sex , unless i have a camera '' ... hypocrites . 
  and while they 're at it they can dish out a few prison terms for men ? 
  really ? 
  they just deny reality . 
  that 's what this is . 
  attaboy, 
  china : 105 india : 45 population : 2.5 billion ( as opposed to 740 million in europe ) imagine for a second what it would mean if they catch up and stay with fossil burning engines . 
  austria 's neutrality is a weird thing . 
  since we 're in the eu and the nato pfp it 's safe to say that it 's non-existent ( and any sane and educated person wo n't deny that ) . 
  but if you 're a politician and say austria is n't neutral , it 's the end of your career . 
  and the fact that austria originally never intended to be neutral but rather it was forced on us by the allies is one thing conveniently left out whenever that topic is discussed .
