  and then he was involved in a [ scandal ] ( http://www.profil.at/articles/1115/560/294287/europaparlamentarier-hans-peter-martin-korruptionsaffaere ) as well . 
  does anyone know what happened ? 
  i ca n't find anything about the trial or a verdict . 
  edit : found a different [ verdict from 2010 ] ( http://diepresse.com/home/politik/innenpolitik/619258/sekretaerszulage_eugh-verurteilt-hanspeter-martin ), 
  angry about stereotype uses stereotype, 
  lol , wake up sheeple , rite ? 
  costs to study medicine in austria : 800eur per year for university excluding textbooks and equipment . 
  how long it takes is up to you . 
  some medical students will study some time abroad . 
  but i have n't heard of people leaving because of pay . 
  in austria when you 're good you can earn a lot with privately insured patients . 
  and the majority of these doctors still work in academia and public hospitals . 
  it 's just the best way to stay up to date . 
  i can only speak for austria . 
  here you can have the fancy vip private doctor treatment of course . 
  but every time it 's a serious issue ( like cancer or severe injuries ) you will end up in a public hospital treated by the same doctors and nurses a person without private insurance would have . 
  research and clinics are very much tied together so that the best doctors are actually paid by the public health care system and so your average joe will be treated by the best austria can offer . 
  apart from the beautiful visualization of data , are there any sort of sources for the `` risks '' that they are mentioning in this video ? 
  or is it just sensationalism/fear-mongering ? 
   luckily , major spills have been avoided really ? 
  i do n't think that there is much luck involved . 
  normally it just needs people who know what they 're doing and resources . 
   the next big spill mhm . 
  in a country where the capital is the city with the [ highest standard of living ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mercer_quality_of_living_survey ) in the world for the last 3 years . 
  unemployment is the [ lowest in the eu ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_unemployment_rate ) . 
  9th in [ who ranking of health systems ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_health_organization_ranking_of_health_systems ) .

  you know what we 're going to do ? 
  vote for the right wing populist ( hc strache/fp \u00d6 / freedom party ) . 
  of course !, 
  i just hope that the greens and the social democrats will have enough votes next time to work something out . 
  if you disagree : please show me [ one statistic ] ( http://www.gapminder.org/ ) where austria sucks :-) ( i 'm not saying there are none . 
  but they 're really hard to find :-d ), 
   imagine running a small place where you and one help does everything from purchase to sandwiches to tapping beer to serving tables to organizing music . 
  i do n't have to imagine that . 
  i know how much work that is . 
  and how exactly is the administrative burden of paying for music different from the administrative burden to pay your taxes ? 
  or to pay fees for all kinds of other things ( and there are ** a lot ** more `` other things '' ; at least in austria , trust me ;-) ), 
  almost everything in your post . 
   it starts getting ridiculious when normal stores , repairs-shops and the likes get fined for playing their fm radio . 
  is someone listening to the radio while working ? 
  is it his radio/cellphone ? 
  or is there a store wide pa system connected ? 
  who is talking about fines ? 
  of course if you do n't follow the law , then you 'll be fined . 
  but i guess i just assume that people/companies normally just pay their bills like anyone else . 
   that is the kind of exploitation of already struggeling small buisiness owners ?!?!? 
  how do you get from a perfectly reasonable way to monetize on art to the `` exploitation of already struggeling small buisiness owners '' ? 
  who is exploiting ? 
  ( yea , i guess the `` corporations '' ) who is struggling ? 
  every small business owner ? 
  why ? 
   that is killing the european economy what ? 
  where did you get that from ? 
  paying bills is now destroying our economy ? 
  since when ? 
   serving nothing but large coorperate interessts . 
  gema is ** not ** a corporation . 
  it is a self-preserving public organisation . 
  their interest is to stay relevant and get their hands on everything that they think they 're allowed to by law . 
  obviously you have to change the law to stop them from preventing technological progress . 
  but this has nothing to do with the fact , that if you use music in your store to sell , you have to give something to the artists . 
  just like you pay for your trash cans to be emptied . 
  this is not a black and white issue . 
  it is not `` bad corporations '' vs `` small business owners '' ( btw . 
  small business owners ** depend ** heavily on corporations ) . 
  and that 's the straw man you built . 
  you ca n't justify not paying for music by saying `` corporations !! '' . 
  that is not how it works . 
  and actually does n't solve the issue germans have with gema . 
  what kind of made up issue is that supposed to be ? 
  what are you actually arguing against ? 
  that is a bullshit straw man if you ask me . 
  am i taking crazy pills ? 
  is n't that exactly how it is * everywhere * ? 
  if you play music , you have to pay . 
  at least in austria . 
  every venue pays a specific amount of money . 
  if you 're an artist , you can log the songs you played and where , and you 'll get a share of the income . 
  and i think that 's perfectly reasonable . 
  restaurants , bars and clubs earn money with playing music , so why not give a fair share of it to the artists who actually created it . 
  putting out a fire is almost impossible when it 's not caught early . 
  and firefighters do n't want to risk their lives everyday so normally they would just check if anyone 's in danger , look for ways to contain the fire so that it does n't jump over to other buildings/trees/warehouses , and wait . 
  i use my kuna for shopping carts !, 
  ... in austria welcome , ( almost ) neighbors !, 
   freedom of speech means anyone can say what they want not true . 
  contrary to popular belief freedom of speech does ** not ** mean people can just say whatever they want without consequences . 
   freedom of speech is the political right to communicate one 's opinions and ideas . 
  [ . . ] in practice , the right to freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations , as with libel , slander , obscenity , sedition ( including , for example inciting ethnic hatred ) , copyright violation , revelation of information that is classified or otherwise . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freedom_of_speech ), 
  tldr : somebody is always butthurt , no matter what you 're talking about . 
  very good explanation !, 
  i tried to explain it like this : imagine you have a relative who is known to squander his money and is not keeping his jobs . 
  now it went fine for a few years , but suddenly all went downhill . 
  he 's about to lose his car/flat and whatnot . 
  first things will be you try to stop the fall . 
  maybe help him sell the car and give him money so he can keep his flat and have something to eat . 
  is the next move giving him even more money ? 
  or do you want to see him actually changing his lifestyle ?
