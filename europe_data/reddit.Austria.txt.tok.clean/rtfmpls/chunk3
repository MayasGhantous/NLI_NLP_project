  i 'd say the latter . 
  that 's the austerity imposed by the more successful countries in the eurozone . 
  they will still pay for a few things that are really necessary , but i do n't think anybody would suggest that paying him ( the relative ) or them ( the countries in crisis ) a monthly income would actually change anything . 
  so after a certain amount of time , people ( an economist would call it `` the market '' ) will actually redevelop trust . 
  they 'll probably be willing to ease the measures . 
  i think it makes a lot of sense . 
  the question will be , when do we redevelop trust in , for example , greece ? 
   $ 1250 before taxes , $ 1050 after taxes you ca n't compare monthly income in austria to germany or other countries because you receive it 14 times a year . 
  1250/1050 is actually 1460 before , 1200 after taxes . 
  what ? 
  this was not a charity ??? 
  it 's still the second largest german-speaking city . 
  really ? 
  got ta avoid that city now . 
  did they all join nato already ? 
  i 'd hurry . 
  ok , thanks . 
  i get it now . 
  yea , and please keep it a secret . 
  or we might actually have a meaningful discussion here . 
  ... what ? 
   a reactionary is a person who holds political views that favor a return to the status quo ante , the previous political state of society , which possessed characteristics ( discipline , respect for authority , privilege , etc. ), 
  that he or she thinks are absent from the contemporary status quo of society . 
  --  right-wing politics are political positions or activities that view some forms of social stratification or social inequality as either inevitable , natural , normal , or desirable , typically justifying this position on the basis of natural law or tradition . 
  where do i accuse him/her of racism ? 
  you doubt that ? 
  well , what are your sources ? 
  in austria there are official stats about how many people try to seek asylum , how many are denied or granted . 
  that made up issue ( by right wing demagogues ) about illegal immigration is ridiculous . 
  as in , this is such a tiny minority , it 's not worth anyone 's time . 
  first time i 'm hearing europeans talk about it btw . 
  up until now this was a gop talking point in the us . 
  i have absolutely no fucking idea where this comes from when we 're talking about immigration in europe . 
  the problems with immigrants ( e.g. 
  : in austria and germany ) are with official legal immigrants , most of which are n't even foreigners but born to immigrants and kept `` isolated '' . 
  it 's people who are citizens of the country they live in , but never adjusted properly . 
  sometimes i forget how right wing and reactionary r/europe can be . 
  de tok ur jerbs so how exactly did this happen ? 
  how did foreigners who do n't speak the language ( or speak it badly ) and have an inferior education steal your job ? 
  you honestly think you do n't have a job because of foreigners ? 
  holy guacamole . 
  edit : forget it . 
  i misunderstood what what op was saying, 
  those that have no right for asylum are thrown out . 
  what now ? 
  do you want an eu army ? 
  because that 's how you get an eu army, 
  that last shot is the ski flying hill in planica . 
  as an austrian i felt the urge to point that out . 
  fun fact : this border was used by us-americans a lot because their eu-visas were limited to 6 months . 
  so they had to leave the eu and reapply to get another 6 month visa . 
  guys ... guys ... guys !, 
  please . 
  do n't listen to that moron . 
  he jumps off of high stuff . 
  that 's not a qualification for ... anything really ( even red bull does n't care about him anymore ) . 
  sincerely , austria . 
   trump is not an isolated case . 
  his success is part of a trend that affects europe . 
  who knows , we might get fn and afd in power before long . 
  fp\u00d6 , wilders , afd , ukip , decades of berlusconi in italy ... we really are n't in the position to talk down because they 're `` electing a moron '' . 
   remember what happened to markets after brexit ? 
  what may follow the us election might be worse . 
  it already started : gold went up , pesos down , japan has some sort of meeting because the markets are getting unstable . 
   the usa is a security guarantor for a lot of countries ( most of europe for example , through nato ) . 
  what happens if they retract their guarantees ? 
  what happens if they decide to return to isolationism ? 
  the start of an eu army . 
  this is just tailwind for the militarists and arms industry . 
   if they decided to renege on all obligations to fight climate change , others are likely to follow . 
  weird as it sounds , climate change for me is waaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy way down on the list of things to worry about right now . 
  as an austrian : glad we could help . 
  you 're right . 
  this has way too many implications . 
  historically these methods have a bad connotation . 
  how about we use some sort of an ancestor test . 
  someone has to prove that parents , grand parents and great grand parents all were black . 
  and if you pass you get some sort of ** race certificate ** that you can use to access certain areas , and maybe even job positions . 
  from my experience , the only people `` hurt '' are from the countryside . 
  in cities people do n't care . 
  slowly everyone will think of themselves as europeans hopefully . 
  that 's odd . 
  in austria rest stops have to provide toilets for everybody . 
  and are not allowed to charge something for it . 
  because it 's germany . 
  the country who learned the most from the past , and will do anything it can to prevent anything even remotely similar to any of the stuff that happened in the 1930s and 40s . 
  there is a lot of stuff going on in other countries that could not happen in germany . 
  they take these things ** very ** serious . 
  for years right-wing demagogues said the same thing about slovakia , hungary and many more . 
  did anything actually happen ? 
  did anyone admit that they were wrong ? 
  does it stop these people from spreading the same bullshit again ? 
  wait a second right-wing fear-mongering ? 
  on my continent ? 
  to those who agree with i-am_batman , i actually live next to slovakia , czech republic , hungary and slovenia . 
  the situation has n't changed a bit . 
  although there is a huge difference in median income between austria and these 4 countries . 
   the ability to use a currency in several countries is n't a success . 
  as i said , you have no idea . 
  it is a big success for me and all of my friends and family who travel and work all over central europe .
