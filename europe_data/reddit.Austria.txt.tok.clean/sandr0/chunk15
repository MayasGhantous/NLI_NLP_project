   there would be competition from whom ? 
  local production is crap and almost dead because of western companies who could sell stuff cheaper in the beginning . 
  how do you defeat a monopoly ? 
  this is something that the eu would need to take care of , but hey , just my 2 cents . . 
  what does that mean ? 
  is he ordering a baguette ? 
   after all , who is going to rebuild the war-torn countries ? 
  https://twitter.com/unhcrdc/status/732579811927941120 with up to 20 years stay , yeah they kinda should integrate ... 
   too soon ? 
  this time , yes . 
   the nsa , fbi , white house , dhs all came out and said that its was the russian government . 
  so the standard answer when they have no idea , did n't change in the last 60 yrs or so , at least they 're consistent . 
  that 's a pretty important topic , if you delete it i do n't know if i should gas my neighbour or not , i mean , now it 's a fucking coin toss . 
   among many of the other posters on here . 
  uhm , dude , you think the posters here are bitter and spiteful ? 
  look at the fucking eu , juncker stopped speaking english , the eu demands the brexit negotiations to be in french ... fucking kindergarten . 
   cost of living is not much lower in hungary how ? 
  if i compare cost of living from austria to germany , germany is already significantly lower ( in basically everything , from food , to showering gel to rents , . . ) , so how can it now be lower in hungary ? 
  how is that a working legal system ? 
  the argument is that a 10yr old could 've given consent to sexual intercourse . 
  that 's just plain retarded . 
  in other countries the age difference alone would be enough for a statutory rape conviction , but nah , we 're fucking pedos and cellar idiots . 
  `` working legal system '' hahaha , in fucking austria , where we need more than a decade to charge a former minister . 
  our legal system is a lot , pricy , slow , ... but working ? 
  this country is so fucked up . 
   angry plebs are invisible until they are real angry . 
  this is true , plebs will let you run over them for a lot of times till they finally snap , revolt and kill your ass . 
  source : 1930s germany . 
  yeah , but is it worth it ? 
  they still prefer the uk , lmfao . 
  the brexit vote was about a uk with the eu not gibraltar outside of the uk . 
  it 's funny that so many people confuse this , even the majority of scots are n't set for independence . 
   as an austrian brought up without any traditions i strongly feel like this is just an excuse the get hammered , do stupid shit and not get prosecuted for it . 
  it actually is . 
  afaik we 've tried that once and it failed because switzerland did n't want it . . neither did we tho . 
  25,7 i need to lose weight . . god damn it . 
  swimming makes u hungry . 
  enough money to eat , but not enough money to eat too much !, 
   austria and germany dude , not again . 
  austria and bavaria , maybe , but germany ? 
  hell no . 
   us uhm , but you 're going to be independent , floating in the sea . 
  you think this is funny ?? 
  they 're denying me the [ 0,78 mbits ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/5730588061.png ) that im paying for !!, 
  im paying for 150 and i 'm only getting 149 , curse you unitymedia . 
   everywhere . 
  progress . 
  the development in almost every middle eastern country disagrees with your statement . 
  besides , progress is a subjective thing , for them their more religious ways are progress , for you the less religious ways of western europe are progress . 
  you 're not getting the point of my initial comment . 
   countries that do n't actually share our values do n't react well to our leaders lecturing their leaders . 
  even countries that do share your values do n't want to be told what to do , we saw that with brexit . 
  i do n't know about obama on a local level , but internationally he 's one the worst diplomats ever . 
   and not in the direction that it was intended to have . 
  but , that was foreseeable , i mean the uk had a referendum because they people did n't feel independent anymore and felt like the eu had forced a lot of decisions onto them against their will . 
  enter foreign president that tells you how you should vote ... well duh . 
  like , thats the centre-left ? 
  what 's the `` left-wing '' opinion then ? 
  do they have obama tattoos and fan conventions ? 
  so how does deportation in hungary work ? 
  in austria you 're getting `` deported '' , 5 yrs later you 're just on the streets hustling and begging your way through life . 
  until you kill some woman , on her way to work , with an iron pole and make the local news . 
  and yes , that happened . 
   apparently it takes over a year to confirm a bearded man is not a child . 
  they 're not advancing is a good way to understate the fact that many arab countries made plenty of steps backwards . 
  the distraction thing is complete bullshit , boys and girls learn different and are motivated by different factors , that 's why segregation could actually lead to better educational results . 
  there are plenty of studies that show that our current education system is catering to girls and in relation `` leaving boys '' behind , so it 's far from perfect , but as close as it gets . 
  but , let 's be honest , segregation would fuck up their social behaviour just for some small academical benefit . 
  lets embrace mother russia then , only 75 % asia , but 78 % of the population lives in europe . 
  you would be right with both statements . 
  naw , progress is just a highly subjective thing . 
  one mans progress is the other mans backwards stone age culture or completely perverted culture without any boundaries . 
   one goal of sex education courses there is simply to teach refugees that if they try anything like that in scandinavia , `` they will get caught . '' lmfao . 
  do n't rape because you will get caught , does n't matter that its bad or smthn . .  a report in february by germany 's federal criminal police , the bundeskriminalamt , showed that refugees were responsible for ** only 3.6 % ** of the sexual offences in germany in 2015 . 
  germany took what , 800k refugees ? 
  so less than 1 % of their population , less than 1 % is responsible for 3,6 % sex crimes , i do n't get the `` only '' part . 
  edit : or does the `` only '' stand for `` refugees are only 3.6 x more likely to commit sexual assault '' ? 
  yes , different political direction . 
   but so do many other news outlets but we do n't speak about that fact if we agree with their agenda , so shhhh, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech  in the law of some countries , hate speech is speech , gesture or conduct , writing , or display which is forbidden because it incites violence or prejudicial action against , ** or by a protected individual or group ** , or because it disparages or intimidates a protected individual or group . 
   waving the isis flag `` is not an expression of disrespect towards any ethnic group , '' she said , because isis is `` against everyone except those who belong to isis '' . 
  yeah , right , its way cooler to kill everyone , being racist and only killing one ethic group is totally uncool . 
  its weird how freedom of speech works only for one political direction . 
  underrated comment . 
  i 'd prefer uk politicians over the germans . 
  then we 'll go full on 1930 on them , history repeats itself , always . 
  lmao , there is no one who could stop her from being reelected anyways . 
  german politicians are a joke . 
  honestly ? 
  alot was written out of the eu-budget and every penny they 're spending for `` refugee costs '' is actually invested in our country . 
  so they need rent ? 
  well , who gets the rent ? 
  us , they need food ? 
  well who sells the food ? 
  our people , they need education ? 
  well , we 're hiring 12445615 new teachers for that , who gets jobs ? 
  we do n't have enough housing ? 
  well , need to build houses , another investment in our `` economy '' . 
  in the short run it boosts economy and creates a lot of fake unneeded jobs , in the long run is completely ruins and fucks the country , but !, 
  that wo n't be the problem of our current politicians since they 're retired until then .
