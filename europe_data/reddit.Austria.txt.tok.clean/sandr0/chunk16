  so for the next ~ 10-15yrs uncontrolled migration is totally cool and positive for our economy , after that ... well , lets say i would move . 
  just like the . com bubble and the housing bubble we 're currently living in the refugee bubble , but this time the state started it . 
  but they 're really really cheap labour , i mean come on , we 've got so many syrians now doing `` community services '' for $ 2,5 / hr , thats fucking amazing . 
  i mean , i ca n't stop that guy from entering as a refugee , if he wants to blow some people up then , what the fuck i do n't care statistically others are more likely to get blown up than me , so i 'm gucci . 
  my reaction as a middle european is : i do n't give a crap . 
  god damn nationalists !, 
  so basically bavaria 's opinion about the rest of germany , just replace pegida with the antifa and you 're good to go . 
  that shits beyond comparison . 
  ama pls . 
  they 're germans , they use every opportunity to shit on saxony , idk why , but they hat saxony . 
  it 's a german thing . 
  the would be terrorist was exactly an refugee , they just neutralised one bad apple amongst their midst . 
  it actually does . 
  but , did they do something good ? 
  i mean all that shit went down because of an syrian immigrant , so , they 've just neutralized the bad , ergo immigrants are `` just okay !, 
  oh god , does that mean there are different people with different opinions in this sub ??? 
  quick , call the thoughtpolice . 
  i 'm actually quite certain that hillary would mean another war , so no thanks . 
  ah you know , if you 're own agenda is n't overrepresented then everyone else is a nazi . 
   because it 's impossible for a syrian to do good . 
  the chase did n't even make it onto the / r/europe fp , sorry but you 're seeing things that are just not there . 
   some people are set to import some hell into paradise though . 
  idk why , but i do find the dtj jr. skittles comparison pretty adequate . 
  uhm , look at the middle east and then tell me , who are muslims most violent against ? 
  spoiler : the answer is muslims . 
  edit : to clarify , against other muslims aka sunni vs shia vs alawites vs , ... oh hell i do n't know . 
  this is why isis ( sunni ) hates al-assad , he 's an alawite which derives from shias which are seen as apostates by isis , not simple `` unbelievers '' . 
   how do you guys look at the middle east and think , `` yeah , those are the people i want in my country ! '' ? 
  i need to remember this sentence , it 's just fucking golden . 
   this could only mean some muslims believe muslims believe violence should be only against other muslims . 
  / j well , look at the middle east muslims vs muslims everywhere , 
   building a case takes time . 
  can confirm , i 've waited years for cases to build and to be finished . 
  most justicesystems are slooooooooooooowwwwww ... 
   especially in europe one might think that it 's a waaayy bigger deal in the us . 
  shitty example , since a lot of them do n't see themselves as germans . 
  he 's german , he does n't care for or love his country . 
   financial services firm hargreaves landsown donates to leave , kek . 
  just wtf is it with putin paranoia ? 
  according to some people he 's behind everything , yesterday the batteries of my tv remote died , i wonder if vlad has anything to do with that . 
   you are swearing fealty to the flag and its constitution , to fight for that nation and abandon all external loyalties which may come before . 
  yeah , no european country has that . 
  guess the jokes about your country are true ? 
  yeah , but they can still do that `` under the table '' , i know of a couple of landlords here in vienna who do n't rent to foreigners and smaller businesses who do n't hire foreigners . 
  not saying that i find that okay , no , but this is a law that 's very hard to enforce you 've to proof that they 've discriminated you . 
  it 's not the same government and you see what happens when you do n't do what the people want on a local scale . 
  shit like ukip , fn , afd and fp\u00d6 starts to form and might get voted into government . 
   i hate her rhetoric on that . 
  it 's perfect , first time i see a `` elected '' official actually doing the work the people want and making it semi believable . 
  nobody said that dutch people are smart , you have the reputation of being weird camping tourists , pot heads and amsterdam red light district . 
  we do not ask for the opinion of dutch politicians x ), 
  1930s neckbeards unite . 
  besides , its pretty telling that a swede would set white males equal to neckbeards , lmfao . 
  do you think you should keep pissing off white males ? 
  they have a pretty violent history . 
  not really , it would probably prosper since we did n't have to invent dumb jobs and can actually start automating the ones we have . 
  i mean 50 % of our current jobs/workforce are pretty much redundant , but yeah , unskilled or semi skilled human labour is cheaper than a machine . 
  the complete opposite from the industrial age , weird . 
  imagine a world where you send people into pension and you limit immigration . 
  the unemployment rates would be amazing , the salaries too . 
  do n't know jackshit about the others , but you do n't have to know anything about austria to gain citizenship , just some basic german words and a 10yr stay . 
  yes , you have to pledge the fucking allegiance to the flag , learn a bit of the countries history and pass a fucking english test . 
  thats how the us does it , you 're supposed to adapt to their culture . 
   `` integrating '' is simply following the law . 
  that 's the mindset that creates ghettos and parallel societies , well fkin done . 
  this is why europe ca n't have nice things , europeans are n't smart enough to not destroy them . 
  how the fuck are they multicultural ? 
  it 's either integrate , kiss the flag or piss off . 
   too many old people in workforce oh know , who would 've thought that keeping people in the workforce till they 're almost 70 could have negative consequences ? 
  right ... almost everybody ... 
  yes , i totally said that and did n't address his `` none of this is close to reality '' point . 
  like my `` it is n't ? '', 
  question is n't totally referencing to it . 
  5/7 comprehensive reading skills bruh . 
  it is n't ? 
  because it is here . 
  i mean , it 's getting weird , i see people sleeping on the streets everyday , on my way to work i encounter at least 10 beggars and it 's never been like this before . 
  yes , 2-3 yrs ago we had punks on the streets who did n't do anything and might have asked for a euro once in awhile , but right now there are pretty normal people sleeping on the streets , begging for money , ... 
   i doubt that jfk meant that thugs who believe they are speaking for the majority are allowed to act violently . 
   antifa ? 
  we do n't have 1 euro jobs , thats why our unemployment is n't down to 4.2 % like germanys . 
   in addition to the unemployment measures covered here , eurostat also publishes statistics for persons who fulfil only partially the definition of unemployment . 
  these persons are not included in the official ilo unemployment concept and have a varying degree of attachment to the labour market . 
  basically everyone receiving hartz 4 , who does 1 euro jobs , and everyone who visits those `` courses '' where you learn ... uhm ... you get to stare at a pc screen for 5-6 hrs a day , been there , done that . 
   ** there is currently no specific legal basis for producing and disseminating monthly unemployment data . 
  ** however , these monthly data are estimates based on results of the european union labour force ** survey ** ( eu lfs ) , which is a continuous household survey ** carried out in ** all ** member states ** in accordance with european legislation and on the basis of harmonised definitions . 
  aka those numbers mean dicksquat . 
  love me some cooked up numbers . 
  [ mexico < 3 ] ( http://famustu.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/how-to-build-a-brick-house1-300x225.png ), 
   depression-faced-alcoholics-europe . 
  pretty accurate description . 
  so uhm , what do you think would happen if every eu country would need to pay their current loans and debts . 
  it completely dismantles your first `` point '' that democracy leads to the tyranny of the minorities by the majority , since the exact opposite is actually happening and discrimination is happening , just the other way around . 
  this is not equality , this is putting minorities over the majority , just because they 're louder . 
  we 've spent decades to protect minorities and care for them ( which is a good thing ) , but we forgot the majority and this is exactly why those right bullshit populists are on the rise , the majority , the middle class average joe , feels fucked over and objectively , he 's right , hes been fucked over , especially in this generation . 
  ** equality is n't a fucking one way street . 
  uhm ? 
  in the last 5 yrs ? 
  i mean , why the hell are women under 29 earning 10-20 % more salary than their male counterparts and still crying about a pay gap ? 
  why can blm block highways and demand police officers to be killed even tho more whites than blacks are dying by police force ?
