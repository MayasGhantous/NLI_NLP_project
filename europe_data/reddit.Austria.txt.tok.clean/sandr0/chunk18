  no , it just means that the others were even worse . 
  a population of 8 million people and we had the worst candidates ever , it 's fucking amazing . 
   czech rep.  czechia please , decide already !, 
  until you 've decided i 'm gon na call the country `` trans-czech '' . 
  who cares who wins in december ? 
  they 're both terrible people and unfit to be president , it really does n't matter . 
  literally the same . 
  the guy who writes articles for `` the falter '' and makes weekly vlogs on `` derstandard '' is one of the chancellors `` advisors '' and thats just one of them ... 
   also , does austrian press say anything on why austria is afraid of uncontrolled crowds ? 
  i mean we allow ~ 30 people/day . 
  we 're nazis , duh . 
   i 'm so glad that we do n't have large muslim groups in our country . 
  god damnit poland , why do you refuse to go down with us ? 
   most of these countries have a foreign population with a higher fertility rate than the natives . 
  yup , thats why we do n't give a fuck about natives anymore , they wo n't exist for much longer anyways . 
  you realize that plenty of people who 're already living here believe in things that conflict with our norms , right ? 
   show off your intelligence you literally showed off your stupidity by comparing apples to oranges , why would i show you intelligence ? 
  if you want to be treated like a intelligent human being you should n't post dumb shit . 
   can i not see gay people kissing , and holding hands ? 
   not even remotely the same . 
  by the way , your precious headscarf wearers would be for that . 
  but , if his right does n't outweighs hers it means that her `` religious bullcrap '' right outweighs his ? 
   zeynab alshelh , a 23-year-old medical student , told australian media she had travelled to europe to show solidarity with local muslim women . 
   footage broadcast on channel 7 showed local people saying they would call the police if she did n't leave . 
  damn, 
   no wonder germany has a stalling birth rate . 
   which western country does n't have a stalling birth rate ? 
  does that matter ? 
  she wants it , so they 're gon na vote until the she gets the result she wants . 
  just like norway and the eu membership . 
  or us and our presidential vote ... ( god damnit austria ) i mean you do n't think that democratically elected leaders actually give a fuck about the will of the people , do you ? 
   some of us are n't racist idiots and have no problem with polish migrants . 
  implying the 52 % are violent racists , well played . 
  duh , londoners have their heads up their asses :\\ ^ ), 
  now that guy looks fucking scary . 
  honestly , the spd is in trouble , the cdu is sinking and they 're pulling the spd down with them . 
  damn , you have a point . 
  so , the uk gets what it wanted ? 
  seriously ? 
  christina st\u00fcrmer for austria ? 
  so many talented artists and you pick that pop starlet ? 
  that 's just [ sad ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/7738cb52b74ade29e2f0a7bbd1968aa2.png ) man . 
  basically non existent . 
  yes , the left wing populists . 
  it 's not , she 's a crowd please and flip flopped numerous times on popular issues , her current issue is that she flip flopped once too often and she knows that . 
  either she stands her ground now or she loses all her credibility . 
   in my oppinion, 
  wikipedia , cute . 
   the independent the paper that hired a plagiarizing bastard ? 
   the guardian oh , i see , you 're delusional . 
   fringe populist parties generally say what their base wants to hear any . 
  merkel is one of the biggest populists of our time ... 
  so it 's either , burn the country down fast and vote afd or suffer for a long time while the others are ruining the country slowly ? 
  interesting . 
  cdu , right , lmao , economically centered and otherwise left leaning . 
  now fucking center parties are considered right wing , okay . 
  a lg g5 is basically a htc 10 just slimmer , with a better front and back camera , a better screen ( colour wise and 0,1 '' in size ) and 150 bucks cheaper . 
  yeah , you go htc 10 !, 
  btw , another plus for the g5 , changeable battery ( htc 10 battery ca n't be changed ) and it has an actual fm radio build in , yes nobody listens to radio anymore , but still , ... you get way more for way less money . 
  we could also talk about sony , but i would just drift into a rant on how a 4k display and a 23 mp camera is just too much on the z5 premium . 
  like , seriously , 3840x2160 resolution on a 5.5 '' display ? 
  what the fuck sony . 
   htc seriously ? 
  i 'm still waiting for a decent htc phone , they 're ages behind of sony or lg . 
  i 'm afraid that 's not a joke ... 30 's -40 's germany here we come . 
  you wore hotpants as a dude ? 
  i mean , that is kind of a odd fashion choice . 
   if god is a serb fuck off . 
  actually , without the beard he looks kinda like [ sebastian schweinsteiger ] ( http://www.mopo.de/image/4831546/2x1/940/470/9c41201cd8e34d3d5bd5cbddb5ea7058/gw/01d-02-71-47582719-ori-jpg.jpg ) . 
  i mean , they could be fucking [ brothers ] ( http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/349/000/hi-res-73472b5b4fd1be340574b7bfc61ebdef_crop_north.jpg?w=630&amp;h=420&amp;q=75 ) , lol . 
   clicks that word is unfair , cl so close together look like a d , so i read `` lost for the sake of di ... '', 
   which would inevitably scare some away good , fuck that tax haven . 
  `` almost like '' = totally is, 
   i do n't see germany 's trying yeah , because that 's the way they can actually cope with the refugee crisis , cheap labour . 
  hell , they had talks about cutting minimum wage for refugees , germanys economy looks good on paper , but in reality it 's a mess that wo n't hold up the next 20 yrs . 
   many swedes for example hate their country it really feels like that , but i wonder why ? 
  and on cheapish , almost slave like labour . 
  germany is europes china . 
  well , they 're getting so much private data through the internet , ofc they want everyone to use it . 
  average time for a war refugee is 16-20 yrs , who said anything about 3 ? 
  bavarians are the only sane germans , then again , they 're basically austrians . 
  depends on who you ask , some see the v4 as a vital force behind the closing of the balkan route , which was very positive for our country so , yeah , there are certainly a lot of people who 'd like to be part of it . 
   you are saying to keep borders closed to thousands of people who have travelled hundreds of kilometers and spent thousands of euros to escape their country , because the popularion of the hosting country does n't want them . 
  literally happening since the first humans walked on earth . 
  most natural thing ever . 
   it 's when we started to get our shit together as a species yeah , in the middle of the cold war were the us and the udssr held the whole world hostage with their atom bombs . 
  great timing . 
   enabled real peace on the european continent in the 60 's , ahaha , thats fucking hilarious . 
  i guess the majority does that itself , when it does n't want to take crapy anymore and starts to act out . 
  you know , like in the 30 's and 40 's in germany . 
   human rights and correct ethical behaviour should n't be dependent on majority political support . 
  so if the majority of the people ca n't define what 's right , then who would you appoint to do that ? 
  how can anybody do that ? 
  you would need to accept a higher instance than the collective human mind , ... do i dare to say a godly . . no fuck that , i 'm for the majority vote sorry . 
   no british politician is ready to say this to the public . 
  may literally said something like , yeah , so what , no single market then , we do n't care . 
  i think he meant england , in [ arkansas ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/england,_arkansas ) . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ credit ^ ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ^ / u/chefdiplomat, 
  oh it will , history repeats itself . 
  we 're overdoing the integration and migration shit right now until the `` natives '' and first wave migrants ca n't take it anymore and the right wingers will rise to power in europe .
