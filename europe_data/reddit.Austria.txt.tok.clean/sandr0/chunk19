  it 's fucking sad , but i 'm pretty sure we 'll see the next hitler rise during the next 20 yrs . 
  maybe because of the nyt bashing , apparently everyone who bashes on the nyt is a racist , just because trump labeled them as the `` failing nyt '' . 
  just another tactic to silence critical voices , and no , i do n't even read breitbart , it 's mix out of populism and tabloid is n't my taste . 
   sure , tell that to the **.net application ** so , microsoft ? 
   they can change `` kenya '' to `` hawaii . '', 
  hahahahahaha , barry jokes never fail to amuse me . 
  probably sarkozy vs le pen . 
   which according to the eu would prevent terrorism hahaha , if i wanted to i could get a gun ( small gun , like a glock ) for 7k in a matter of hours . 
  banning legal weapons wo n't prevent terrorism , it will just increase the demand and supply of illegal weapons . 
   ` how we did n't get our message out ' our lefty parties try to justify their loses the same way , except they add something like `` we need to educate people '' , sometimes politics feels like a scientology cult . 
  like seriously , i know all about your policies , i do n't vote for you because i think they 're absolute shit . 
  well , all polls are showing that a second referendum is n't wanted or that the outcome would be the same , so i guess thats that then . 
  but she really , really wants to be a independent country !, 
  cmon , do it , just for her !, 
   in a party like labour uhmm the party has been a joke for decades ? 
  i remember vaguely tony blair telling christopher hitchens how is fellow party members reacted to losing elections , it was something along the lines that the mps thought they we 're right and the population just too dumb to recognize that and to vote for them . 
  labour is so far away from reality and the people , its sad . 
  afaik there were even protests , local farmers blocked the highways n shit , cuz the camp people are stealing or destroying their crops . 
  state does n't give a flying fk tho . 
  or you do n't know anything about decent train services ? 
  if i compare the austrian \u00d6bb with the german db , i 'm pretty fucking glad that i 'm living in austria . 
  i 've had a couple of trips with the db and . . no thank you , i 'd rather fly . 
   british prime minister theresa may has said she wants to curtail the free movement of people even if it means giving up access to the eu 's single market . 
  this drew a warning from european commission vice president valdis dombrovskis , who said there wo n't be any cherry-picking and that the free movement of goods , services , capital and labor were a `` package . '' cherry picking ? 
  she literally said , even if we lose access ... everybody was concerned about the uk being able to negotiate any deals , but after a couple of months i 'm actually concerned about the eu being able to negotiate anything in our favour ... 
  but the things that are being sacrificed or were sacrificed for the sake of the european project are okay , amirite ? 
  just like helmut kohl said , back when he learned about greeks faked books , we will still take them , for the sake of the european project and unity !, 
  i said many , not all , lol .

  i mean , one could argue that history , especially the 30s and 40s , taught us that germans are a bit like sheep . 
   they should be able to integrate without lessons . 
  how ? 
  just throw them in and hope everything works out ? 
  kek . 
  but would you want stuff for free that you really do n't like ? 
  i mean , lets say you hate fish ( a lot of people do ) and someone gifts you a trout , what would you do with it ? 
  does n't matter tho , nobody here wants to be part of something thats north of bavaria , 
   only got re-elected once because of laws , you ca n't serve more than 2 terms . 
   and has maintained a relatively high popularity rating uhm , she herself , nah , her party is still popular , even tho it dropped like 20 % , but they stay popular due some members who come up with shit like `` abschiedskultur '' and horst seehofer populistic stuff . 
   bush ended with pretty low popularity ratings afaik higher than obama . 
   his successor was obliterated . 
  john mccain , thats not even a serious candidate . 
  you 're comparing a chancellor to a president ... thats some serious mental gymnastics you 're doin there . 
  thats like comparing ronald mcdonald to the ceo of burger king . 
  george w. bush was the leader of the free world for 8 years and even tho the dot.com bubble bursted at the beginning of his presidency and the world trade center got destroyed , the country is still standing , your point ? 
  i read a lot of shit on / r/europe , but to be fair , our media tried to present it that way as well . 
  it 's actually a difficult topic , there are many nuances , but the end of the story is , no , he does n't want that . 
   or trying to acquire skills to actually get a job but they 're effectively taking my time to do that , i 'd rather study for the msc microsoft exams during those 30hrs , but . . 
  i ca n't , i do n't have access to my virtual servers ; 8 i even said , i want to learn !, 
  i want something where i can improve , but they wo n't give you that , but they would pay for a ms office course , which is very helpful for a system administrator . 
  not . 
  there was actually a german that , jokingly , tried to bring up the anschluss in / r/austria , now that guy got downvoted like hell . 
  not really , you 're still lacking leadership , merkel has no idea what shes doing . 
  contrary to popular opinion not even the fp\u00d6 wants a anschluss . 
  the only acceptable germans are the bavarians . 
  id rather work than sit in one of those 30 hrs a week courses where you do nothing just so you 're out of the unemployment statistics . 
  and yes , im posting this while i 'm sitting in one of those , depression intensifies . 
  it 's true what they 're saying about reddit and sarcasm .

  he is n't lmao , freedom of opinion only counts of your opinion is acceptable by our current society . 
  only 800 !, 
  of all muslims around the world , 
  is n't it , in their eyes , a sin to actually bury them ? 
  because they will live on and the blood will smell like . . ah whatever , some crazy ideology . 
   even in the worst case scenario , where scotland would have to reapply for the membership this is n't the worst scenario , this a guaranteed fact , there are plenty of statements from eu officials confirming that a independent scotland would need to reapply like a normal country . 
   they would do it in two years tops . 
  that would be a record , especially if you consider that they do n't have a currency or any trade agreements . 
   it 's a formality no it 's not . 
   belgians tend to be boring and a bit more distant towards foreigners that 's the only thing that sucks in belgium . 
  you 've never been to austria , huh ? 
   staying in the union is known to be negative in the longer term bs and you know it , but i 'm actually rooting for a independent scotland , why ? , because i 'm the kinda guy that likes to watch car crashes . 
  crash and burn nicola , crash and burn , i 've got my popcorn ready . 
   the eu referendum really did highlight the vast gulf that 's opened up between classes of society , and how in this ` communication age ' we 're actually ( in many ways ) more cut off , not less . 
  this is happening across the whole union tho , the lower and the middle class feel more and more betrayed with each passing day . 
   it 's only hope is to fly on it 's own now and do what ireland did by finding a niche for itself . 
  wahaha , ireland found its niche as a tax haven inside of the eu and the other members are n't amused , trust me . 
  there is a lot scepticism inside of the eu towards a independent scotland as member , some fear it might end up like greece , others fear it might end up like ireland , weakening them and lets not start with spain who would hate a independent scotland for its own reasons . 
   personally , i find the promoters of the status quo populist , relying on uncertainty and patriotic feeling of `` the 300 year old union '' sentimentality to sell their point . 
  then they 're idiots , because its the safest economic route for scotland , nobody cares about the past . 
   a constitution , a people 's state with free education ensured , reviving the scottish countryside to be more than a green desert , reviving small-scale manufacturing , and so on . 
  and they 'll fund that with their prayers ? 
  sorry i 'm a realist , not a dreamer . 
  the whole scottish independence stuff she 's bringing up again is pure populism . 
  i mean , yeah , the uk will , probably , be worse off outside of the eu , but what will happen to an independent scotland ? 
  the eu would n't accept the scots on their `` first day '' , the country would have a couple of years 5-10 without eu or uk membership , it would have to introduce a own currency and negotiate some trade agreements with the eu and the uk . 
  i mean , the eu would need to know that the scots able to `` fly on their own '' , nobody inside the bloc wants another greece on constant live support . 
  that does n't look like a bright future and is something no one ever brings up . 
  her whole independence rhetoric does n't hold up in a semi intelligent conversation , that 's pretty typical for populism . 
  can i call sturgeon a populist ? 
  would that be fitting ? 
  uhm , i didnt bring it up , the guy above did and presented the screening process as something perfect when in reality its pretty crappy . 
   if they managed to jump through the hoops of adoption system do you know what kind of people are slipping trough that system ? 
  some of them i would n't trust with a pet hamster . 
   who i am to say they can not adopt a child ? 
  well , thats a complete different matter because it does n't involve 2 adults anymore . 
  i do n't give a shit if they get married or have a registered partnership or what not , why the fk would i care about that .
