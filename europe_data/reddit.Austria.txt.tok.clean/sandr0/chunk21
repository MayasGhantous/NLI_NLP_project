   and they never fail to set cars on fire during ramadan well , that 's one way to celebrate . 
  plundering and damaging the property of others is seen as a left wing thing , just as violence is seen as a right wing thing . 
  does n't even matter , or actually it does . 
  i think he got mobbed in school cuz they were mostly sunnis and he was shia , one day he flipped ... gg, 
  actually , it would be francis t. and since i do n't know what the t in john t. edges name stands for he 'd be t.e. 
   for many of them , here = home . 
  now that sounds like you do n't know many of them . 
  i was actually shocked when one of my half turkish friends , who i 've never considered to be a turk , told me that he will always be a turk , that is him , its in his blood , location does n't matter . 
  i asked him , but you have no relations to turkey , why would you say that ? 
  his answer : they 're my people . 
  and we 're speaking about someone with higher education ( college ) , i know many more who 're born here but who do not identify as austrian . 
  and i suspect that this behaviour is not that uncommon in germany either . 
   or are they deliberately using his middle name and first initial of his surname in futile attempt to make him not sound muslim ? 
  this one , at least for his first name , german and austrian press do n't release surnames of criminals . 
  you know , do n't out their family , etc , . . 
   there are definitely some who do . 
  if they want to , for religious reasons , they are n't compatible with western civilization and need to go home , where they 're free to do so . 
  easy solution , adapt and ** integrate ** or get the fuck out . 
  every western country should , a hijab is enough for muslims and totally fine . 
  burka , niqab and maybe even chador are not fine . 
  you 're actually right , the german media is leaving out the `` ali '' , ... lol and then they wonder why they 're called manipulative or `` l\u00fcgenpresse '' . 
  i saw the vid , it was actually a old guy that yelled the insults , did n't sound like a 18yr old . 
   are you saying that the majority of terrorists lately are n't arabic ? 
   you are just the kind of guy who would deny the problem , no matter what happens . 
  right ? 
  im literally the guy that blames everything on arabs , check my comment history , i even had an argument with that guy you responded to about how trump is not a fascist and that he 's a blind left idiot for calling people something and not knowing the definition of the word . 
  but i 'm against mentioning statistics and not proving links . 
  did n't they completely turn around a couple of yrs ago ? 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/16/iranian-models-arrested-for-posting-pictures-without-headscarves/ http://www.france24.com/en/20160403-air-france-flight-attendants-uproar-over-order-wear-headscarves-iran, 
  got a link to those terror statistics ? 
  good guy gunmen !, 
  or it means that the team might have to overthink its strategies and acquire some promising talent . 
  and i 'm not talking about deadweight like a possible independent scotland, 
  or the is counts on your stupidity and humanity . 
  maybe they 're smuggling the people an weapons into your country that way ? 
   now is the time where we have to show our best side . 
  solidarity , friendship and unity . 
  then we win against the terrorists exactly !, 
  just melt all the guns , destroy all the bombs and give the police teddy bears and flowers . 
  this is how you stop criminals !, 
  just hug them and love them !, 
   whereas male circumcision has no comparable long-lasting negative effects . 
  depends , according to studies it does damage a lot of nerves and your orgasms are n't as intense or as easy to achieve and ... some statistics count vagina piercing as fgm . 
  yeah , our neighbours are weird like that , guess our visitor 70 years ago left some deep scars . 
  btw on your `` facist point '' , which is basically you just yelling out the word facist , like a toddler that just learned it and thinks it sounds funny , but has no clue what it means . 
  professor [ stanley payne ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stanley_g._payne ) ( us , university of wisconsin , author of '' [ fascism : comparison and definition ] ( https://www.amazon.com/fascism-comparison-definition-stanley-payne/dp/0299080641?ie=utf8&amp;ref_=asap_bc ) '' ) , [ robert paxton ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/robert_paxton ) ( us , university of columbia ) , [ kevin passmore ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/definitions_of_fascism#kevin_passmore ) ( uk , university of cardiff ) , matthew feldman ( uk , teesside university ) and [ roger griffin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roger_griffin ) ( uk , oxford brookes university , autor of '' [ the nature of fascism ] ( https://www.amazon.com/nature-fascism-roger-griffin/dp/0415096618?ie=utf8&amp;*version*=1&amp;*entries*=0 ) '' ) disagree with you . 
  but i guess the guy yelling facist is more educated that the actual experts . 
  who needs experts , right ? 
  fucking nerds just studied this crap their whole life , what the fuck do they know ? 
  fuck them !, 
  i mean , trump `` only '' voids at least a couple of the ground principles of fascism , but whatever dude . 
  yea , and merkel is a reverse hitler . 
  you just called him a fascist , which either means you do n't know anything about him or fascism . 
  this is n't even sad , this is plain stupidity . 
  i would n't go that far , but the pseudo intellectual reddit left does n't know the definition . 
   well i do live about 45 minutes away from the canadian boarder . 
  heh i knew it , the missing bedsheets gave it away . 
  i did n't say that academics preffer trump over clinton , there probably are some , but i do n't care about that . 
  i said that academics , historians and various other experts on the fascism subject , denied that trump is one , movements like black lifes matter or westboro baptist church are alot closer to actual fascism than trump ever will be . 
  call him a racist or a xenophobe , but fascist ? 
  please . 
  god please , educate yourself , this is embarrassing . 
  weird , it 's you word against the academics , who shall i believe ? 
  the experts or the random reddit user ? 
  yeah , our you 're ** hillar ** iousl ** y ** under informed . 
  i feel a clinton like candidate would be possible and i consider clinton way worse . 
  no [ bedsheets ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/2b/ae/b1/2baeb1e4b7f67d95aa98c17f685710f8.jpg ) ? 
  guess you 're actually canadian . 
  because you 're a self-centered idiot . 
   i feel sorry for any muslims in europe walking around with headphones accidentally hanging out of their pockets . 
  you mean brown people , because , if you like it or not , you ca n't tell if someone is a muslim . 
  well except the chicks that are running around dressed like tents . 
  you do n't even know that , nobody can say how brexit will turn out and it will take a couple of years anyways . 
  what kind of dickhead assumes that all they planned was fucking up your future ? 
  why would the old fuck up the future of the young ? 
  who will pay their fucking pensions if you leave for an eu country or if you 're jobless and without future ? 
  they would n't fuck your future on purpose , why ? 
  because they would fuck their last days . 
  get your head out of your ass . 
  you 've heard right , he 's talking out of his ass . 
  stop ruining the circlejerk . 
  meh , honestly , someone killing or bombing people in france is barely newsworthy . 
  happens all the time now anyways . 
  yes , it 's not happening that often in germany . 
  nah , i 'd say he 's mid 20s - 30s with a very one sided worldview . 
  i 'm calm , i was just making fun of you , jesus learn to take some criticism thats packed in a sarcastic comment . 
  people these days . 
  well , they promised more dead people and more attacks and attacks in france are happening on a monthly basis now . 
  mock them all u want frenchies , but your people are still dying . 
  i 'd say they 're pretty decent at keeping their word , even if they 're not behind the attacks , which no one can really confirm or deny . 
  dat cleavage . 
  i 'm on my way . 
  ah , we wo n't take them instantly anyways , they would have to leave you , would have to introduce a new currency and show us that they can survive as an independent country . 
  scotland will probably collapse before they 're in the eu . 
  but it might be fun to watch . 
  do n't want it tho , we do n't need another `` barely alive '' member , greece is enough tbh . 
  first it 's the old people , now it 's the leaders , soon its going to be the weather ( if it just did n't rain on the voting day ! ), 
  you 're one of those guys who always needs someone to blame when you do n't get what you want , eh ? 
  and racist , and white , and bigoted , and men . 
   but if they see the young as self entitled who have everything maybe they do n't ?
