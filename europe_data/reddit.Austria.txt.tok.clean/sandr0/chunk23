   romanians should have been hackers because of guccifer ? 
  the dude literally just read the biographies and tried buzzwords as passwords , ... l33t hax0r !, 
   netherlands should have been drugs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/de_wallen, 
  fun fact , anita sarkeesian took the navy seal copy & pasta as a real thread and tried to get the cops involved .

  always . 
  insult, 
  nah , you 're interpreting crap into the statistics . 
  i could go ahead and say , hey italy , greece and spain have a couple of muslims and do n't like them , muslims must be evil and germans , netherlands and british people are just gullible people . 
  or i could say , hey look , since the germans took in more muslim refugees and since they have to deal them they start to dislike muslims ( +5 % ) , guess they really are evil . 
  ___ all you did was try to give the stats some meaning for your own agenda , if that was your point , then yes , i know your point . 
  dawg , the greece figure is from 2014 , the oldest because the statistic did n't want to reflect the opinions after/during the refugee crisis . 
  besides , greeks generally dislike turks and would like to have constantinople back , but hey ... 
  or people have different opinions ? 
  the anti muslim view is very high in greece despite a pretty high amount of muslims , explain, 
  your point being ? 
  meh , pretty biased , he gives some good cases , like sweden , who still have the krona , but forgets to add why , and that the eu closed that loophole ages ago . 
  there alot of `` yes , this is doable '' things that leave out some facts that are proving otherwise . 
  a opinion piece fitting for a patriotic scotsman !, 
  cheers . 
  good riddance uk . 
  you do realize that ireland just leeches of the eu ? 
  i mean they 've reduced corporate taxes to 12 % and are a eu tax haven . 
  that 's why corporations like [ apple ] ( http://fortune.com/2013/11/01/on-site-at-apples-famous-irish-headquarters/ ) , google , facebook , microsoft , [ dell ] ( http://www.educationinireland.com/en/why-study-in-ireland-/ireland-s-strengths/leading-global-companies-in-ireland.html ) have their eu base in ... [ ireland ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/ireland-attracts-soaring-level-of-us-investment ) . 
  i do n't think the rest of the eu will watch that shit show for very much longer and i do n't think that the other 26 countries want another tax haven . 
   so this was democracy too . 
  hitler was never democratically elected , the only elections he won were after he took power . 
  yes , even then . 
  i like to take statements and names of those statements as direct quotes and not as some `` i heard somewhere '' from a guy on the internet . 
  besides , are you implying that experts have no own agenda ? 
  1 gbp = 1.18 euro , so if pound sterling is in the cellar , what is the euro ? 
   i mean sure on paper you `` have to get the euro '' but there are quite a few countries that are not willing to go for it ( yet ) . 
  sweden/denmark and a few others are using outdated loopholes , they 're allowed to use them , but those loopholes do not exist for new members , yes new members are forced to work towards the euro and new members are forced to take it as soon as they 're eligible . 
   i 'm not saying it 's impossible . 
  i 'm saying it would take the scots to voluntarily to opt for austerity three times that which george osborne has inflicted - or joining much later . 
   put it in that context and i just ca n't see them rejoining anytime soon . 
  too much realism here , let reddit and the scots dream , let them have their referendum and let them fall flat on their faces , like the uk does . 
  they did n't invent that , we did . . fk off . 
  hey david !, 
   which one do we trust , the guardian ? 
  never trust the guardian . 
  this is what i do n't get , does every brit assume that his parents and/or grandparents hate him/her ? 
  i mean , those folks raised you , nurtured you , ... why do you assume they want bad things for you ? 
  kinda blows my mind . 
   `` old '' or `` uneducated '' was n't it , `` old stupid racist white british men '' ? 
  i think i read that one a lot on social media . 
  wow , hold it right there , we 're on reddit here , stuff is either black or white , do n't introduce us to your greyscale shit . 
  i kinda agree with the first one , but the second one . . holy moly . 
  at making baguettes . 
  this is so true . 
  nah , i have only austrian and german bank accounts . 
  german one mainly because of the free visa and mastercard . 
   its not the systems fault that one part is incapable of sending in a serious contender i really do n't know who you 're talking about , the clown or the goldman sachs employed criminal ? 
  serbian bank account ? 
   google street view was run out of town . 
  it has been run out of our country . 
  we do n't like change , we do n't like technology , we 're sceptic towards everything thats remotely new . 
  yeah , i would do the same . 
   there is still massive amounts of underreported rapes in any case . 
  you ca n't fit the laws to `` report '' unreported crimes . 
  the only thing that worries me about this law is the current case of gina-lisa lohfink , who would 've exploited that law , she was n't a victim , does n't matter what the article says . 
  the former `` germany 's next top model '' candidate made a sextape with 2 dudes and said no during the intercourse ( yes , i 've seen it , no i 'm not proud of that ) , but not to the intercourse itself , the no was regarding the filming , her lawyers tried to interpret this as rape , thankfully that law was n't passed a month ago , so the case was dismissed and she was charged with wrongful rape accusation . 
   hopefully this can help some of those underreported cases coming to light in germany , too , as the victim will feel she ( or he ! ), 
  has more support in the law . 
  no , it wo n't . 
  people are normally against germany because the germans are bad winners . 
  15 hrs later . 
  haha, 
   it 's against human rights . 
  nope . 
   the eu is allowing it . 
  good !, 
  let me guess , vienna ? 
   because they may have to move back to xenophobic little england ? 
  get german citizenship and leave the country , that you do n't want anymore , alone ? 
  or to put it in another way : just fuck off . 
  on the other hand , this is coming from a , probably butthurt , irish who still has a axe to grind with brits , so ... 
  i think your reasoning might be faulty . 
  they lost the vote and if you 're against a majority , everything is fair game , 
   except for the stereotypical enlightened atheist westernized youth . 
  aka common nutjobs , the modern jehovah 's witnesses, 
  your map is wrong here are the right ones : [ austria ] ( https://neverpureandrarelysimple.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/1822_4594_500.jpeg ) [ australia ] ( http://images-cdn.9gag.com/photo/agrwqon_700b.jpg ), 
  duh , we have them in our sch\u00f6nbrunner zoo . 
  wtf r u talking ? 
  the slovenia/slovakia joke is probably unknown in murica and more common in austria , since we border to both countries . 
   avstro-ogrskajugoslavija well played . 
  got ta admit , i do n't know a lot about czechoslovenia . 
   an he simply can not understand that his views about the world might not be the absolute god given truth . 
  maybe they are ? 
  who are you to judge ? 
   and not remain member of a club whose best argument for staying is ` if you try to leave we 'll break your fucking legs ' pretty much on point, 
  no we have only one plan for the endsieg, 
  it 's more like , since wales voted brexit it was a pleasure for them to send another quick fuck you to belgium aka brussels . 
  [ duuuude . . ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adsyhwlenvm ), 
  / u/mess8 do n't listen to scare mongers and sensationalists like the guy above me , if you planned it , move to britain . 
  none of those incidents seem more extreme or harder than anything else that 's going on in other european countries and big cities . 
  the smaller things are getting a lot of news coverage in the light of brexit , that 's normal . 
  it generates views and clicks for the bbc and other outlets . 
   which is usually considered one of the most tolerant countries in the western world by whom,
