  ca n't a pole stole my keys . 
  good guy uk, 
   but if there 's no proof of fraud why repeat the election ? 
  there is no proof that there was n't fraud , but there was a possibility . 
   esperanto 2.0 not this horseshit again !, 
  not by choice ... 
   `` food triangle '' r u talking about the [ food pyramid ] ( http://17au6t1m9fww7tz2h3hbljfs.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/classic-food-pyramid.jpg ) that has been taught in schools ? 
  because that thing was debunked a while ago . 
  nice a cal counting page that leaves out every other aspect of the food . 
  \\ #healthy, 
  potatoes have a unusual high amount of carbohydrates , which will make you fat . 
  if you 're only looking at calories , well a glass of coke should n't make you fat either , since it has less carbohydrates and less calories than 200g potatoes . 
  17g carbohydrates . 
  why do n't you eat raw sugar ? 
   potatos are fine if you wan na get fat and unhealthy , yea , potatoes are worse than meat . 
   and the negative health effects of eating so much meat hope you do n't eat wheat , starch or grain instead , cuz that would be kinda hilarious . 
  there is shit in fertilizer , fertilizer is often used to grow vegan food , so ... vegan food is n't vegan !, 
  still not as bad as too much starch or wheat . 
  stay away from bread , noodles and potatoes , 
   it only showed how `` simple '' person you are , with all this images . 
  nah you 're just butthurt because you ca n't take a joke , and now you 're even more butthurt because i poured salt in your wound . 
   the article you sent : talk about the whole number , without talking about the `` nationality '' of stealers - gangs from russia , etc still use poland as transit zone so our police catch them . 
  i would link the articles that are explicitly talking about polish gangs , but the economist ca n't be linked in this sub because `` muh , paywall '' . 
  yes , but he was n't the sole leader of the leave campaign , or as heseltine put it `` the general '' . 
  that boris , without a plan and a clue , mobilized more voters than cameron or corbyn shows that there is some kind of disconnect between the parties and the people . 
  i mean , he 's a clown and a reta ... , but you ca n't blame him alone . 
   however one starts to wonder why the stores are full of foreign workers while the same stores gets thousands of job applications and norwegian youth struggle to get summer jobs . 
  give it a bit of time and your people wo n't wonder anymore . 
  i 'm pretty used to the fact that no one in the stores around here can speak accent free or grammatically correct german . 
  he 's making this pretty fkin easy for everyone else in his party and the country . 
  he makes it sound like johnson did everything , he single handedly won the referendum and overthrew everyone . 
  where were all those remainers ? 
  why did n't cameron or even corbyn reach the people ? 
  how is johnson so much more powerful than anybody else in the uk ? 
  is boris johnson so much smarter , more cunning and charming than every other british politician ? 
  because to me he looks like a buffoon , who apparently `` out smarted '' everyone , which says a lot about british politicians and heseltine himself . 
  agreed !, 
  ay , actually there is no more english in the eu , what did the french presidential candidate propose ? 
  french will be the new offical eu language !, 
  ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ happens : ^ ^ ^ auxit ^ ^ ^ plz, 
   sweden they wo n't give their loophole up . 
   if it meant a physical border ? 
  no , if it can be done without one then imo sign us up . 
   schengen countries need to secure the outside borders ... 
  you do n't bother with sources and i do n't [ bother ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/8988201/cars-too-easy-to-steal-in-germany-says-polish-ambassador.html ) taking your word for it . 
  but i do [ find ] ( http://i.imgur.com/klvowda.png ) the [ amount ] ( http://img01.lachschon.de/images/69380_gta_polen.jpg ) of [ butthurt ] ( http://img01.lachschon.de/images/144901_meanwhileinpoland_1.jpg ) [ kinda ] ( http://static.cosmiq.de/data/de/2f6/34/2f634e6fdef672c7409f6dd3782acadc_1_orig.jpg ) [ amusing ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/0b/a4/f0/0ba4f032cfd677926f92468a7b422e53.jpg ) . 
  mh it 's looking up for monkey island . 
  i could actually believe that . 
  i 'd like to tell you that this happens in other eu countries as well , but you 're in the spotlight right now , tough luck . 
  i 've seen similar incidents in austria and germany . 
  btw the video the article is about was posted here a couple of days ago , so apparently there are n't enough incidents , so we need to repeatedly talk about the already known incidents . 
  yet they 're one of the richest countries in europe . 
  direct democracy does n't work and hurts everyone , hur dur , . . 
  that thing was so hilarious and it 's amazing how many people bought it and how many are still buying it . 
  duhh , antarctica wants another referendum !, 
   it 's not about competence . 
  spain is being entirely self-protective . 
  op is correct . 
  same question to you , why are germany , denmark and france denying talks too ? 
  why does only spain make the headlines ? 
  why does tusk refuse to meet sturgeon ? 
   yeah exactly , this statement is n't even about scotland . 
  why are france and germany also denying talks ? 
  why is tusk not meeting sturgeon ? 
  you 're right , we should never take the word of eu officials , they do n't know what they 're doing . 
  we even have a german saying `` kaum gestohlen schon in polen '' , which loosely translates to `` as soon as it 's stolen it 's already in poland '' . 
   how do you know ? 
  answer to both questions : i read papers , i inform myself and there have been eu statements from eu officials regarding both matters . 
   also being dated material . 
  damn , you 're one year in the position and you 're already considered `` dated material '' . 
   ** reports on social media said ** the polish man had been attacked and told to `` go back to his country '' , with some saying the floor was covered in blood . 
  like and share this post to stop racism !, 
  really ? 
  our right wing does n't take the `` dey tuk er jebs '' route , they 're going for the `` they 're only on welfare and stealing your taxes '' route . 
   car-stealing eastern europeans funny how every country has the same prejudices about poles . 
  idk just the hopes and the unspoken promises sturgeon makes are giving me a bad vibe , i feel like a lot of scots have unrealistic expectations . 
  `` stay in the eu '' - not even an option , you 'd have to rejoin , which means first you need to be independent , then you have to apply for normal membership , which could take a couple of years . 
  a couple of years where you 're neither a part of the uk nor a eu member . 
  and you 're only going to be a member if you accept a worse deal than the uk had and you have to use the euro , no more pound sterling ( might be a bonus tbh ) . 
  i wonder if scotland expects the same deal the uk had , if so , you 're in for a surprise . 
   a friend in need is a friend indeed . 
  but a friend with weed is better . 
  if you want to get high , bring your own [ supply ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zizowgv21r4 ), 
   you even see here and there sympathy for a federalized eu . 
  i 'm just glad that this sub is represents basically the opposite of the `` reallife '' views . 
   you should of seen nigel 's speech where he said the majority of meps dont know how to fill out paper work juncker trying hard to prove him right . 
  you 're completely wrong , you 're done if you show racist tendencies , socially and in your job , because of the stuff that happened 70 yrs ago . 
  i do n't see any statistics in that article , just a list of minor incidents . 
  we 're talking about a country that has the fucking [ edl ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/english_defence_league ) , a right wing group that got abandoned by its founders because it became  too extreme < . 
  no they do n't , those things happed before , now they 're getting more media coverage because you can blame brexit . 
   just watching this now , it 's absolutely disgusting what this referendum has done to people . 
  it has n't done anything , the xenophobia was always there , the referendum did n't magically turn people into racists . 
  i mean fuck , its even here in austria or in germany , the cute vid about the manchester boy who was racist in public transport ? 
  i 've seen scenes like this in austria and germany . 
   churchills now that was an actual racist and a bigot . 
  yeah , but he was right . 
  i know right ?!, 
  it 's so important to crack a couple of funny jokes !, 
  does n't matter what his policies are or what he 's doing/has done otherwise . 
  this video made the eu parliament look like highschool .
