   how long until we have a leader again that 's actually going to help us ? 
  never again , same goes for every eu country tho . 
   will we still be friends with the continent , or has this just gone too far ? 
  who does n't love that foggy island ? 
   will we get over competitive with the eu , and see popularity nationalists spill over into something worse ? 
  i do n't think your capable . .  are we going to set up a mechanism so we can still discuss european politics from the outside ? 
  yes , discuss , not influence , 
  well , it was kinda the same back before we joined , the left did n't want in , ( greens ) , but everyone else was okay with it , nowadays the tables have turned and the left loves it , but the right wants out , i mean they ca n't say it officially because the media would bash their heads in , so they 're saying they want more national power , but actually they want out . 
   do you go to klan rallies just for the bbq ? 
  cuz i posted in the_donald , you 're so pathetic , the regressive left stereotype . 
  you 're funny . 
  typical lefty , someone disagrees ? 
  nazi !, 
  now that 's a good one . 
  but you are butthurt , it 's not like he 's insulting you or making things up , you are , infact , butthurt . 
  i thought the propaganda was bad before the vote , but now . . this shit is getting kinda ridiculous , guess its true what they 're saying about `` the silent majority '' . 
   the only party that want to leave the eu in denmark are the far left wtf ? 
  left ? 
  like left ? 
  how ? 
  ah , do n't worry they will deal with it as efficiently as they 've dealt with greece 's crisis . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ rip, 
   oustria fk off . 
  it 's not , you 're paying # 350m , but you 're receiving roughly # 162m back , so it 's not a lie . 
  thats why , for me , it was kinda obvious that the nhs would n't get the full # 350m . 
  the `` good '' part is that the government can control where they use the 162m , instead of trying to get eu funding for dumb shit and projects they would n't do otherwise . 
  still , you people are boned . 
  because china does n't fund mexico , so they ca n't cut the funding and build a wall with the money , so they ca n't make them literally pay for it , the us could tho ; 9, 
  it 's not , it says `` fund our nhs '' it does n't say tunnel every pound into the nhs . 
  even if only 10m are going to the nhs , it 's still true , since the nhs receives more funds , or is n't it ? 
   if they manage to send cameron and his lot to the backbenches . 
  are you talking about the former prime minister cameron ?

  can you point out the difference to the eu ? 
  sounds more like a [ suggestion ] ( http://leftfootforward.org/images/2016/05/rsz_cikhd7axaaiklxc.jpg ) and not like a statement . 
   to see countries going back to the seemingly secure national identity is n't what i was hoping for . 
  mainly because the promised `` european solution '' to stuff like the refugee crisis never came . 
  there is no solution because countries like germany are blocking everything even tho they have no ideas themselves . 
  `` we can handle it ! '', 
  is not a valid solution . 
  i can actually see your point and agree with it . 
  some parties , like the greens here are never labeled that way , yet they fit the category . 
   if yours would somethings gone rather wrong with your democracy you overestimate the democracy in the other european countries , i could see our government ignoring such a referendum . 
  [ well , i 've been reposting this for 3 days , now my friends , its time . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcpjnuwdkkw ), 
   and the neoliberal agenda isnt that the current eu agenda ? 
   that 's because you see it as a punishment . 
   no , that 's because he phrased it as one . 
  kinda half serious/half comedy guy , nice to watch . 
  funny  john oliver makes me vomit . 
  but the animals are a british band , so they fit better , 
  you think ? 
  priviledge everywhere !, 
  if it was that easy , 52 % of the austrians want a referendum , ~ 280k signed a anti eu petition ( even tho there was almost no news coverage , i only found articles after it happened ) , but the parliament chose to ignore both  i mean , hell did you see who won the rome election in a landslide ? 
   they do n't really want to leave . 
  http://www.profil.at/oesterreich/umfrage-abstimmung-eu-austritt-6250609 52 % of the austrian citizens want a auxit referendum . 
  racist !, 
  thats what the average french lol player would say . 
  what the fuck hungary ? 
  how can you betray us like that ? 
  you realize that , if they leave , others might follow . 
  denmark would be one candidate . 
  britain leaving would invoke a domino effect .

  sexism !, 
  this is the wetdream of right wingers , `` evil george '' wants bremain , lol . 
  yes . 
   but one which one ? 
  i feel old . 
  its nothing you have n't seen already , it will be the normal `` trump wins , i move to canada '' crap , just british . 
   and if the vote is `` out '' lets be real here , the vote wo n't be out . 
  the jo cox murder is too good , it will convince the undecided and bremain will win . 
   show me a better study that shows how shitty vienna is then . 
  i never said it 's shitty , that 's your interpretation , i just disputed the study , which is conducted by foreign managers with a lot of money to spend , besides , it 's not even a real `` study '' , its a fucking survey . 
  should be kinda obvious that this ca n't stand for the average citizen , but hey apparently everyone here makes 200k a year , the 30 % youth unemployment does n't exist and rents do n't cost up to 17 $ / m \u00b2 , good to know that you know so much more about this city . 
  i only said that its overcrowded , you 're trying to make a fuss here , debating about xenophobia , living standards and what not . 
  so predictable , first you bring some weak arguments , then i disprove them so you have to resort to the xenophobia card . 
  i 'm sorry that i do n't take the statements of foreign managers who do n't even take public transport as serious as the average citizen , i must be such a xenophobic asshole , lmfao . 
  yes , according to the mercer study , if you do n't see a flaw with that or know how that is conducted and who 's asked for that study then yes , highest quality of living for viennas citizens / s lets ask some top 10 % managers about the quality of life . 
  edit : damn , i forgot , they 're also foreign . 
  uhm , have you read your own comments in this thread and your disregard for certain facts ? 
  i mean i 've never been on tumblr myself , but you 're the first one i 've encountered on this sub who actually fits almost every criteria . 
  well , its my opinion , the majority of people seems to like it , 
  ca n't wait for the referendum to be over , the hourly british propaganda is really ruining the frontpage of / r/europe . 
  besides , that 's still cheap compared to the berlin airport , that will probably never open lol , whats the point of this article ? 
  showing off that the british government is n't as wasteful ? 
   but never when men are . 
  like what ? 
  is n't that literally what europe did ? 
  they saw the all men team and . . oh what the fuck why am i even explaining the plain obvious to you , you do n't want to hear that anyways . 
  thats just mean , friendly , but mean . 
  diplomacy is overrated anyways , playing little games is way cooler . 
  atleast someone who 's ignoring the fact that almost 25 % of the population are living in one city !, 
  thank you !, 
  i need my daily ignorance . 
  for comparison : nrw : 521 ppl/km \u00b2 , biggest city in nrw , cologne : 2584 ppl/km \u00b2 , vienna : 4437/km \u00b2, 
   in other news , austrians are getting frisky . 
  no we 're not , the immigrants are .
