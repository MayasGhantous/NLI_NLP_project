  but 9.5 million , that 's fucking horror , especially if you think that most of them will live in vienna which is wayyyyy to overcrowded already . 
  now i 'm waiting for the obligatory `` i have no idea about history '' guy that will post [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vienna#/media/file:population_of_vienna.svg ) chart , and will completely disregard the fact that vienna , during those spikes , had up to 26 districts instead of 23 . 
  cmon where are u bro . 
   you mean 13.7603:1 . 
  yea , thats what i meant . 
   do you have any data ? 
  nah , i was n't really interested in the housing market back then , but friends that were compared the price of my flat with the prices of similar flats in similar neighbourhoods on the market back then and were pretty shocked . 
  like i said , i avoided the worst and now i 'm paying 9 $ / m \u00b2 in a average 16 $ / m \u00b2 neighbourhood . 
   i was talking about the years directly after the introduction of the euro . 
  we actually saw pretty high spikes in the years after the introduction as well , but i already had my rental contract made in schilling , which got 1:1 converted to euro , so i avoided the worst , thank god :d, 
   is that the everyday prices ( rent , utility , services ) has actually decreased . 
  interesting , rent prices here are actually exploding and have never been so [ high ] ( https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t31.0-8/13346103_994318410638085_2330659497247425641_o.jpg ) compared to average salaries . 
  groceries are also ridiculously overpriced , but beer is cheap !, 
  i mean , we do n't care as long as alcohol is cheap . 
  i love how john oliver never tries to push an agenda and always presents a unbiased and objective view . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ those ^ ^ ^ ^ who ^ ^ ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ ^ ^ tell : ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ was ^ ^ ^ ^ sarcasm . 
  they totally did n't pick up boats full of afgans on a weekly basis back in 2010 and sent them back to turkey . 
  never happened , all the documentations are a lie . 
  especially the french one from arte ( 2 reporters posed as refugees on that boat ) , where they found the boat half way from turkey to greece , made a hole into it and called the turkey coastguard . 
  thats all a conspiracy , that never happened and it is impossible . 
  also the bbc documentations pre 2015 are a lie , its all fake made up in hollywood , just like the moon landing , obviously . 
   leave them standing in the see till they swim back ? 
  yes . 
  nah , not just `` left-wing '' people , its everyone whos kinda pseudo intellectual and wants to show off that he/she knows what 's going on in the world . 
  it 's mostly students or people who quit college that adore him . 
  the whole thing is so cringeworthy , but the worst video he made was regarding our presidency . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkritemh7kw that guy fucking represents me in the european parliament and there is no way for me to vote him out . 
  soon fayman will join him . 
  fk , got ta hate modern aristocracy , now it is n't because of `` muh bloodline '' , its because of `` muh party member '' . 
  yeah the sea has no end , theres no coast where you could build some fences . 
  he 's just cutting together clips and taking statistics out of context to look intellectual and to fit his agenda . 
  lets take the [ austrian poem ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4oxuxy/full_brexit_poem_by_eugen_freund_austrian_mep/ ) , completely cut off , or the tirade of [ nigel farage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5ilhua1cpg ) , i mean there is no question that farage was way out of line , but he had a point . 
  nobody voted for him , most europeans do n't know the people that are sitting there , so he has a point when he says that democracy is not strong with them . 
  just cuts it together and farage looks like a zoo monkey who 's only throwing shit . 
  it worked for hungary , not their fault that italy and greece do n't want to build fences . 
  so it worked, 
  i 'm pretty disappointed in you . 
  yeah , but you as a person need to be smart enough to see trough that . 
  to me jo is a joke and nothing he says could ever influence my political views , but he can make me laugh sometimes . 
   fair points ___  john oliver those things ca n't coexist . 
  he 's a comedian , you 're not supposed to take him seriously . 
  cuz the eu is a german pyramid scheme and for the scheme to work you need more memberstates , duh . 
  in 4-5 decades we 'll expand the eu to africa . 
  actually he is n't , it 's eu free movement between certain countries , which means the theoretical limit should be the population of all those countries combined , but , it 's way higher because the eu is unable to secure its borders . 
  besides , there could be a limit for immigration of non-eu citizens , which would be important . 
  he 's talking about poverty inside of the eu , ignoring the fact that a lot of people who are fleeing from poverty are coming from completely different countries or continents . 
  edit : there is a nice little box on the page that shows that the migration from non-eu countries is actually slightly higher than from eu countries . 
   the problem is that they do n't . 
  farage admitted that himself . 
   nobody does , its a bold move . 
  hell , the us had no idea what would happen if they cut ties with the crown , they just did n't like the taxes , guess that turned out alright tho . 
  i think he did n't meant literally adverts , i think he was talking about the statements given by various politicians . 
  like sch\u00e4uble of germany , the pm of norway , juncker , ... , hell even obama . 
  they we 're basically trying to bully the uk into staying . 
   it is a much more positive , ego-stroking message and its from orban , of all people . 
  everyone uses scare tactics except `` the scary dictator '' , weird . 
   it really is n't unexpected , uk leaves and suddenly the most powerful `` brake '' on expanding eu powers is gone . 
   this so much . 
  many eu sceptics want the uk to stay so they can keep blocking stuff , but tbh that wo n't happen , the status quo is gone , if the uk votes for bremain the uk is committed to the eu and ca n't keep blocking shit and if the uk votes brexit the european experiment is over . 
  either way , the referendum fucked everything up . 
  check ur history , white male cis scum . . lmao sry i had to . 
  ah you know , it 's always easier to point out the flaws of other people/nations . 
  besides , when you 're a raging anti nationalist , every argument is fair game . 
  ca n't think of a single one that has clean hands tbh . 
  so churchill = bad , [ churchill is considered to approve the eu ] ( http://europa.eu/about-eu/eu-history/founding-fathers/pdf/winston_churchill_en.pdf ) , so eu = bad , so brexit = good . 
  nice , it all works out , cya great britain . 
  well , if the bremain people try to exploit this incident by saying he 's a brexit terrorist / right wing extremist then there must be some kind of rational thinking to this . 
  other he 's just a random lunatic and the bremain people try to slaughter the story for profit . 
  rekt . 
  i do n't think so , but i do have to admit that the timing is very weird , just a week before the referendum and when leave is projected to win by a decent margin . 
  i mean if that nutjob was for leaving and thought that everyone else was a traitor , should n't he be kinda you know , calm because his side was winning anyways and the traitors get what they deserve ? 
  why would he go berserk just a couple of days after the sun endorsed brexit and after it got projected to win , should n't he gone mental sometime when bremain was leading the polls ? 
  they 're never wrong . 
   that has certainly not been the trend thus far . 
  idk various politicians , like our new president , want to work towards that . 
   it 's possible that next president of commission will be elected directly by the people no way . 
   besides hurting the russian economy and the finish economy . 
  the european cycle of death and death ? 
  it 's a european problem , we 're gon na take turns now , your turn is over , now its finlands turn , sit down greece . 
   and all the other women are just `` girlfriends '' ? 
  i wonder how thats supposed to work out , especially in sweden who has now , thanks to migration , 18 % more men than woman . 
  seems like like polygamy would the other way arround , a woman with 2 husbands x ), 
  they 're not only `` pointing out the consequences '' they 're also implying that deals that other countries have , like norway , switzerland , ... would not happen , no way at all , which is completely bonkers , if anything this would strengthen the relationships between the uk and the usa , why the fuck would we want that ? 
  i had to repost this , because apparently you ca n't link to the dailymail , or breitbart , or thelocal , or . . what the fuck automoderator ? 
   just the ignorant minority who wants to leave so , if brexit happens , how exactly are the british people that want to leave the minority ? 
  besides , how are they ignorant ? 
  so you know how the eu has affected them and you 're qualified enough to judge them ? 
   most of this euro-skepticism is kremlin fueled . 
  not really , we had euro-sceptics back when we voted for in and we still have them , they just switched sides , at the beginning our green party was heavily opposed , now its out right wing . 
   so bashing the idiots back in line , with strong arguments i 'm missing the arguments . 
   effectively treasonous fraternizers with enemy doctrine in a hybrid war nice tinfoil hat, 
  so now we 're trying to bully eu member states into staying ? 
  nice . 
  well , other countries like germany do n't enforce it anymore , so yeah , i think that influences those statistics . 
   makes me wonder why people do not want to be austrian if you 're male and under 35 you might have to do military duty , if you have n't done it in your country . 
  i know plenty of people who do n't get the citizenship because they do n't want to do military duty . 
  that 's what i call luxury , which is weird since we 're talking about romania . 
   it 's usually frowned upon when media loses objectivity . 
  not around here , papers in germany and austria see it as their duty to tell you what you should think and how you should misinterpret statistics . 
  if you point that out in the forums of said papers you will get criticized , because many people agree with that view .
