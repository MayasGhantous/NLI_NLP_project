  just at mcd/starbucks and stuff . 
  i 'm kinda glad that my internet provider has [ this ] ( https://www.unitymedia.de/privatkunden/angebote/unitymedia-wifispot/wifi-fuer-unsere-kunden/ ) , which will come to germany aswell . 
  basically every unitymedia modem will broadcast a second wifi network where u can login with your user data and surf . 
  every mcd/starbucks , most trainstations , . . 
  romanian internet is probably the fastest in europe . 
   making it easier to fire people creates more jobs . 
  i really liked that one , it 's just too funny . 
  you 're a complete moron . 
   its still better than a thousand workers in china . 
  is it ? 
  looks to me like they 're just trying to avoid the import taxes . 
   and i thought there was a raging shortage of developers in europe . 
  apparently there is a shortage for every workforce ... mainly because people do n't want to work at the , by the most corporations , desired rate of 1 $ / h. 
  i 'm the source , or history is the source , since it fkin happend , this site is just the first google result .

  i think the alcohol and haiders reckless driving did that for junker , sorry i 'm not into conspiracy theories . 
   this can only lead to trouble . 
   the current path leads to trouble . 
   we are now coming in to a time where almost every european doesnt know what war is . 
  western european . 
   voting to stay is voting to fight him . 
  like you have the power to do so , haha , try it , i dare you . 
   threatening to do it over an actual election is fucking scandalous has already been [ done ] ( https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/02/haid-f22.html ) . 
   the eu will unilaterally decide that the democratic choice of the people of these countries is `` wrong '' and punish them for it . 
  they did that already from 2000-2008 , while the fp\u00d6 was in our government . 
  not really new , but nice that they 're openly admitting now that the eu is , slowly but surely , turning into a totalitarian regime . 
   what a completely idiotic idea . 
  fitting to juncker , who is a complete moron . 
  probably as inacurate as it gets . 
  as unlikely as radical muslims , who throw gays from buildings and the far-left ? 
  but only on the inside ? 
  this looks extremly complicated and still shitty . 
  thats amazing . 
  that would fuck up the isolation part . 
   if you want to tilt it you can only do that on a window that opens to the inside . 
  why would n't you be able to do that on a window thats opening on the outside ? 
  just tilt outwards ? 
  ^ upvote this . 
   hint : one of these is frequently featured in news articles about not respecting basic human rights . 
  probably merkel ? 
  i mean , we all know erdogan is a good guy that will keep all those refugees from flooding europe . 
  lmao . 
  but why ? 
  this is developing into a abusive relationship . 
  juncker tries really hard to piss off every member state . 
   shapes do matter you 're right , i just found a [ secret nazi hideout ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/88202e79c0abbde936d494ea6176fc1d.png ) in kenya , because shapes matter . 
   either we figure out a common refugee policy or the schengen agreement dies : we change the schengen agreement , or abandon it for some new one that reflect the current situation and our interests . 
  thank fucking god , someone with sense , what is it with people today that they think old agreements must be held , no matter what , i thought i was kinda conservative , but jesus christ some are hardcore closet conservatives ... 
  well , that 's a no brainer : perish . 
  i do n't take threats too well . 
  whops ? 
   remember wallonia could veto ceta but the snp has basicly no voice in brexit negotiations . 
  yeah and remember the outcry and the people calling about the eu rules needing to be changed ? 
  oh dear , what have you done . 
  snoopsnoo says , based on your comment history , that you 're a psychotic stalker , so who 's the wacko ? 
  and you actually stalked that guys comment history ... snoopsnoo is genius . 
  so , how 's that not local news ? 
  it 's 72 raisins , check your facts . 
  reason for removal : local crime . 
  [ x ] rekt [ ] not rekt, 
  i am sterdam ? 
  what is sterdam ? 
  some kind of std ? 
  is it deadly ? 
  your french flag is turned sideways , wtf, 
   it says they are n't sure about it , because they ca n't figure out the details of what people were shown on facebook and other social media which is bullshit in itself , because everyone knows that facebook uses targeted ads and already pre filteres the content you get to see , so you would n't need an extra ai for that , so a bullshit claim . 
  actually , i was just making harmless fun of an article with a clickbait title that shows exactly zero evidence for any of its claims . 
  but i guess you can project a agenda into the fun comment if you try really really really hard . 
   that saw the fake poll and that the poll itself is n't fake . 
  this thread title and op tho . . yea . . fake as fuck, 
  maybe i am . 
  no wait , an ai would 've way better grammar . 
  because the article gave no evidence and is only of speculative nature ? 
  i mean , read the last paragraph . 
   but details of how people were being targeted with this technology raised more serious questions , he said . 
  `` we have no idea what people were being shown or not , which makes it frankly sinister . 
  maybe it was n't , but we have no way of knowing . 
  there is no possibility of public scrutiny . 
  i find this extremely worrying and disturbing . '' basically , we do n't know if anything happened atall . 
   is out political system run by ai ? 
  possibly . 
  check this out !, 
  i bet remain and brexit both had ai 's , but he brexit ai was way smarter , now the remain ai is pissed and wrote a guardian article . 
  so the guardian might be run by ais !, 
   this seems to be a pure taken out of context speculation from the the guardian , please correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  do n't make me read this . . cmon i only came for the jucy comments ... ah screw you . 
  edit : so , i 'm back , i `` reddit '' * wordplay * , you 're right , it 's pure speculation and the last paragraph pretty much says : `` we do n't know what happened , we do n't know what was shown , we do n't know jackshit . '', 
  this might mean war ... 
  so are u tho, 
  [ when you think that people who went through 9 other safe countries are forced to seek asylum in the 10th ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/44/70/fc/4470fc964d2655b70a6b6db690799060.gif ), 
   universal healthcare would put eveyone on a relative flat plahing field and we cant have that in america you realize that we do have private healthcare too ? 
  it 's the same shit here , if you have money you can cut the line and get the best doctors , if you do n't have money you get the `` free '' shit that everybody gets . 
  you do n't have to actually work more efficient , just fake it till you make it . 
  does this comparison take skin colour into account ? 
  i do n't think a white swede would be 12.2 more likely to end up in a us prison , a coloured swede tho ... now that 's another story . 
  my point : the comparison website is inaccurate shit . 
   other westerneu citys have their rent prices go up with like ~ 50 % just because there 's marginally less rentable accommodation and marginally more people looking for one . 
  yeah , but we 're still taking people in , no problemo . 
  btw , `` taking people in '' means most of our own poor sleep on the streets and we might donate for [ sleeping bags ] ( http://shop.caritas.at/ein-schlafsack-fuer-obdachlose-menschen ) , but we do house refugees . 
  he actually does work that way .
