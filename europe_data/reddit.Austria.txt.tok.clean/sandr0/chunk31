  do n't wan na spend money on climate change , but still afraid of it ? 
  ah just publicly deny it . 
  bam , bill gates and his buddies fork over a couple of billions , plus donations from private people . 
  fml . 
  i wonder how much of that is going straight to the child and how much goes into `` administrative costs '' . 
  $ 335 per child/day thats fucking 10k a month , are you kidding me ? 
   the collapse of that system i fear will be bloody . 
  meh , will be the same shit as it was in the 30 's , some hardcore mega asshole will come to power , we 'll go all nazi again for a decade and reset ~ 2045 , blame merkel and the germans and all will be fine for another century . 
  honestly , that 's the most likely outcome , it 's in our nature , the austrian does n't say a lot and he lets you screw him over a lot worst thing he might do is moan a bit ( sudern ) , but once it reaches a certain point , ... well fuck . 
  so , plan your escape ahead , because shit will go down . 
   we let millions starve to death so that a few thousand middle aged men can pretend to be children here . 
  but muh , welcome culture , there are no borders ? 
   in sweden we dont have any statitics one the race of the offenders of specific crimes how convenient . 
  we do have statistics about that , but our papers spin them into headlines like `` 3x more natives commit crimes than immigrants '' or `` twice as many austrians unemployed '' and you get some quality content in the articles like `` the unions are at fault !, 
  they do n't let the refugees on the job market at the first day , so the refugees get bored and have to rape '' , that is a literal quote from gerfried sperl , who writes for `` derstandard '' . 
  7 mio natives vs 1 mio immigrants , do the math . 
  all those moroccan war refugees . 
  how can any stance that is supported by facts and statistics be unreasonable ? 
  sounds more like the people who do n't listen to facts and statistics are the unreasonable ones . 
   i do n't know why you 'd want an incompetent , short-sighted zealot in power . 
  it does n't work . 
  yeah , i do n't like hollande either , but that was kind of a fitting , but harsh description . 
  does that really make him a commie ? 
  was n't it the same with hitler ? 
  so , maybe he 's literally hitler . 
  aaaaaand this is why your side is losing . 
   in france half of the police force in france tends to learn towards the right . 
  i think that 's the case in almost all of our countries . 
  might be because they 're at `` the source '' . 
  i like how an ex-alcoholic high school dropout is `` germanys next savior '', 
   resulting in a slow and often ineffective government . 
  you think your government is slow and ineffective ? 
  oh you silly silly and naive boy . 
  compared to our shit show your government runs like a fucking clockwork . 
  the last 4 years or so have been a fucking soap opera , the sp\u00d6 and the \u00d6vp do n't know if they already wan na break or nah or maybe just change leaders and make up and threaten to break up afterwards and meanwhile nothing gets done and they 're blocking eachother ... please just make it fucking stop . 
   to me , right now , schulz has massive potential in uniting the eu during times of stability . 
  tbh , i think right now he would tear it apart , almost every country drifting to the right and then germany sends a lefty ? 
  yeah , that 's gon na work out just fucking fine . 
   am i the only one that thinks this word for word copying of trump memes and applying them , word for word , to schultz is some of the most cringe worthy stuff i 've ever seen ? 
  nah , its just desperation . 
   art . 
   does n't fit 90 % of the ppl that came 2015 , nice quote - not . 
   drink unalcoholic beer meh ? 
  many muslims drink , smoke , screw around and what not , they just do n't want their woman to do it too . 
  why not ? 
  now we have `` some '' muslims who want adapt islam to secular culture and we 're already celebrating those fringe elements , pretty much ignoring the majority . 
  i mean , let 's face it , europeans are so fucking delusional that we will try to establish something like that , it will fail and it will bite us in the ass . 
   just because they historically did does n't mean we should make it fail or that it will again . 
  yeah , lets try it again and again , and [ again ] ( http://www.ceylonguidance.com/images/ashleyberges.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/i4hd_albert_einstein_definition-of-insanity.jpg ) . 
   it often seems that if you want to do anything in europe on a large scale you 're going to need an institution . 
  history taught us that those institutions , or `` unions '' break apart very , very quickly and the eu wo n't be an exception . 
   i think even the serbs agree that milosevic was n't a good guy . 
  depends on who you ask , i do know people who would still cheer for him . 
  maybe because most of the english own up to brexit and kinda want it ? 
  should we dig out the video documentary that says how much worse tesla cars are for the environment ? 
  this is why it 's completely pointless to opt out of nuclear power . 
  so we do n't have a nuclear power plant , who cares , we 're still fucked if anything goes wrong around us , radiation does n't fucking care about borders . 
  touch\u00e9, 
   our government had control all along , just blamed the bad stuff on the eu really . 
   so does every country , most hilariously the germans , i mean , you 're our fucking superpower , we basically have todo as you say , how can u blame us ( the eu ) ? 
  wtf ? 
  but [ i 'm from austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcouylarli8 ) and never heard of anything like that . 
  edit : i had to add the obligatory youtube video . 
  yes , just like mozart was german and hitler austrian , but do n't tell the germans . 
   as if that picture answers the question . 
  it does n't . 
  the picture is literally linked to the wikipedia page , how fucking lazy are you people ? 
  is extreme laziness a swedish thing ? 
  like are you seriously too fucking lazy to click the link and view the first image ? 
  what the fuck . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_marine_corps_scout_sniper#controversial_use_of_the_.22ss.22_symbol 1 fucking click . 
  spoiler : it 's not a official logo , just some dipshits posing with a ss flag . 
   nokia who ? 
  just like italians are spaniards with pizza in their mouths and frenchies are italians that did n't shower for months with snails in their mouths . 
  probably most reliable german tv station . 
  waste ? 
  the pizza was eaten by the attending viewers and the rest send to the red cross ... 
  so , europe too now ? 
  the democrats in america already escaped any responsibility by pinning the election loss onto putin and some eastern european trolls , no it 's not that hilldog was a weak candidate , it 's all putins fault !, 
  now we 're preparing the same excuses for our establishment . 
  guess putin really is a almighty god , bow down to vlad , no one can stop him . 
  here i thought he was hitler . 
  https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5smci9/most_europeans_want_immigration_ban_from/ddg8v2k/ no ? 
  poland was given as example later on , which should 've discredited the fatigue point , but did n't since the fatigue point was made for the continent not a single national state . 
   ukraine is more akin to russia . 
  which shared alot with ... poland ... uh shit , we 've come full circle . 
  sad , i really liked his refugee [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo0irsfrpq4 ) . 
   if you move from one nation-state to another you are migrating and as such an immigrant in the target country . 
  the argument was that europe , the continent , is suffering from migration fatigue , but a european ca n't migrate to europe ... 
  last time i checked ukraine was in europe so , ukrainians are n't migrating to europe , just to another country within europe , which makes your point pointless . 
   poland took in over a million refugees from ukraine . 
  nobody complains about that , but they do complain about potential muslim refugees mhh , immigrants that share your culture or immigrants that are known to not assimilate very well . . who should we take ... mhhh , such a hard choice . 
  shocker !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ not . 
   i would suggest banning any religious courts , however , that wouldnt suit christians i guess . 
  yes it fucking would , i am christian and i 've never heard of any `` christian '' court shit around here , wtf is that supposed to be . 
  oh you silly , silly unknowing young naive and innocent being . 
   the greek tax evaders & fiscal authorities ? 
   small fishes . 
  so we can make the muslims responsible for the discriminatory laws passed by norwegian and german politicians ?
