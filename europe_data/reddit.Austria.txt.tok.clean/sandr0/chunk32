  so , uhm he 's talking about children , genital mutilation and progressives being crazy apologists and you all of the sudden rip on the welfare system ? 
  are you sure that trump is the [ apprentice ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/photo-diary/files/2013/04/mas_angela.jpg ) , maybe its [ somebody ] ( https://da8y7eku82cdf.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/dgap_article_pictures/pictures/460x259/23451_460x259.jpg ) [ else ] ( http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/juncker-merkel.jpg ) ? 
   t 's a drama generating machine for hyperbole and out of context snippets . 
  even worse , it 's controlled by a corporation who can censor everything they do n't like ( which , to some extent , they 're already doing ) . 
  pretty sure all those us bases in germany and other eu countries are spying on us anyways , but w/e . 
  i mean , i am european , i am living here , but some part of me wants to see the uk and the us form a own union and kick the smug eu idiots ass . 
  they 're all bitter and shit because the uk did what a country is supposed to do , ask the population about a direction for the future . 
  something switzerland is doing on a monthly basis . 
   the eu never listened to the uk before anyway , nothing will change fool , the uk stopped or weakened a lot of things that many other eu countries did n't want , now with them gone and not being the `` bad guy '' anymore things are bound to change . 
   for may to think it will continue is just naive . 
  elaborate , why ? 
  the uk is the only country on our continent ( except russia ) that the current us president has any interest in . 
  all others are `` overrun by immigrants , full of terrorists , ... '' , so how is her position weaker ? 
  it would 've been weak if clinton had won , but . . she did n't . 
  should i point out that he 's ** theoretically ** beheading a french statue ? 
   you did n't made a deliberate decision to criticise germany instead of one of the other countries that do questionable stuff . 
  maybe , just maybe because germany is the biggest one , the biggest profiteur and portrays itself like a country full of angels . 
  sorry that i did n't critique a country that has almost no influence at all , i forgot , going after the big fish is a sin . 
  like i said , you 're religious and delusional . 
  i think you do not understand , i never said you 're a muslim , i said that you 're treating your left believes like a religion , that makes you religious . 
   i 'm telling you i am not religious . 
  i was raised a catholic and gave it up . 
   you gave up one religion for another , nothing uncommon . 
  you are , you 're treating your left believes like a religion , you stop questioning , ignore simple complaints and logic and when your views are challenged you resort to standardized phrases like the scared and otherizing stuff to justify your behaviour . 
  i 'd say you are very , very religious . 
  you know what , i take one statement back . 
  you might know why they 're wearing the veils , since you 're very , very religious yourself . 
  pope francis would like to have a word with you , if he is n't `` left '' then i 'm not of jewish descent ( hint : i am ) . 
  so , serious concerns about security and identifications is `` otherizing '' people . 
  you might be * slightly * delusional . 
   without having a clear understanding of why women wear these items . 
  it 's not like you have the slightest clue why those women are wearing burqas . 
  you wan na live your religious live ? 
  stay in your country . 
  it 's hilariously easy . 
   i put facts in italic because you made it personal for no reason by implying i was hurt by your endless knowledge and wisdom . 
  when did i claim endless knowledge and wisdom ? 
  i 'm just reacting to someone who called my comment history `` hate for germany '' , even tho i did n't say anything like `` fuck all germans '' or made up some ridiculous claims against germany , you , my friend , are the one that tried to make it personal \u270c . 
   * facts * i like how you put that word in italic , like germany does n't have the biggest [ minimum wage sector ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/6bca47bbe5c1a09a343deff9abd0967c.png ) , like your politicians do n't have a plan [ that excludes refugees from minimum wage ] ( http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/migranten-bundesregierung-plant-ausnahmen-fuer-fluechtlinge-beim-mindestlohn-1.3317242 ) so they can boost production , like germany does n't have a [ huge ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/60903d66c28467d4242e9fdf2393dc2c.png ) trade surplus inside of the eu . 
  quote me one thing that 's factually wrong . 
  but then again , you 're just the kind of guy that comes in and says `` your facts are hate '' , so i guess a discussion is useless . 
  i 'm austrian , that 's like our birthright . 
  besides , quoting facts is n't `` hate '' . 
  edit : but , i 'm kinda flattered that facts hurt you so much that you had to checkout my comment history . 
  you saw them because he 's either talking out of his ass , ignoring their existence or only living in the outer districts like 22/23 and never visited the 1st or the 16th district , which would be quite the accomplishment . 
   hardly happens in europe to see people with a burqa  ever visited the 1 . 
  district of vienna ? 
  they walk in groups of four ... you ca n't really overlook them . 
   i do n't see why wearing a veil on the streets harms anyone . 
  like really ? 
  you do n't see how it could be problematic to be unable to identify someone ? 
  maybe hitler is still alive and running though your city with a burqa , you 'll never fucking know or a isis leader is just living right next to you , going out with is burqa for his shopping trips . . or how do you identify a burqa wearer that steals something or hurts someone ? 
  i 'd like to see you reporting a crime committed by a full veiled person to the police `` a black ghost did it '' , lmfaoo . 
  not saying that every burqa wearer have malicious intent , but you 're trying to protect the few that have . 
  and i 'm not even going into the feminist argument and view that most burqa wearers are forced to do so . 
  i 'm sorry , but i ca n't buy pricier products just because they 're made somewhere else , i and many others can not afford that . 
  besides , even if they 're `` made there '' they probably use parts or machines for production that were made in cheap germany anyways . 
  your `` vote '' is an illusion . 
   greece deficit is a direct consequence of germany maintaining wages too low compared to production . 
  ding ding ding , germany has the biggest `` billig lohnsektor '' in the eu , they 're basically our own china . 
  i remember buying a toaster half a year ago , i was kinda shocked that it was `` made in greece '' i did n't read that sentence in ages . 
   if they start terrorising you over their religious rights , maybe they were n't nice people to begin with yeah , but alot of those nutjobs are already in our countries . 
  just last week we had like 2 raids against radicals , they even found a freaking bomb that should 've blown up a metro station . 
  all you can do right now is please them and hope they do n't fucking blow you up . 
  imagine a alternative world where merkel would 've said fuck off the the refugees and let turkey be overflown with them . 
  like how many turks ( germany has a lot of turks ) would 've demonstrated or rioted ? 
  how many other muslims would 've done the same because she denied their `` brothers '' ? 
  she 's literally just `` staying calm and carrying on '' . 
  well , nobody should , yet it 's common practice , because honestly , if you take their religious rights they 'll start terrorizing you and most countries do n't like to be terrorized . 
  brother , you 're literally the guy who tried to start flamebaiting and insulting and after i 've called you out on your immature behaviour you 're playing the `` oohh are you hurt '' card ? 
  are you unable to comprehend your own comment history ? 
  i will stop answering now , i do n't make fun of disabled people , be it mentally or physically . 
  guess you 're soon old enough to cast your own vote !, 
  nice . 
   greek governments rigging the public finances did . 
  and who knew about all that before they accepted greece into the eu ? 
  right , helmut kohl . 
  i could go into details and argue how the eu and euro membership basically ruined greece in the longterm , but as always germany profited from greece 's misfortune , but why should i ? 
  not as much . 
   the greens won the presidency they did n't , but nice try . 
   does van der bellen have any say in this ? 
  he could say that he 's very very disappointed ... 
   `` a stronger germany means a stronger europe ''  no . 
  well , duh , germany profits like hell from the eu . 
  yey , a fear mongering article with almost no basis in reality . 
  i do n't know much about macron , but i do know that hollande basically sold out and there is n't much left left in him ( puns ! ) . 
  but you ca n't deny that schulz is more left than gabriel ever was and merkel , who is still your chancellor her coalition partner does n't matter as much , is n't left either . 
  schulz as chancellor would be a drift to the left . 
  nope . 
   we might be in a good position to get something started . 
  something like \u00d6xit . 
  i 'm kinda half serious , if the 2 big ones in the eu drift left while the rest is drifting to the right , uhm . . bye bye . 
  funny , same goes for our elections `` oh shit , i better vote sp\u00d6 or the fp\u00d6 actually wins everything '' . 
  even tho i do not like this party ... 
   i just really dislike the movement that combines that with blowing up the eu . 
  yea , but whose fault is that ? 
  the nationalists or the eus stance on immigration , which is basically non existent or just not doable , as we saw with dublin 3 . 
  mh , guess brexit is gon na be easier for britain than everybody thought . 
   but remember that switzerland only has 8m people haha , only ? 
  we 're twice as big and we also have 8m people .
