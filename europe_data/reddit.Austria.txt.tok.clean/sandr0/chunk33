  how did the ` muricans put it ? 
  you give the germans a little finger ( austria ) and they 'll try to grab your whole hand ( europe ) . 
   immigrants ? 
  or arab/muslim europeans ? 
  uhm , yea ? 
  i mean , you 're from france you should know , france is `` the most dangerous country '' for jews . 
  do n't confuse me with your logic , all rightys are the same . 
  god , i miss john paul ii . 
   to being the us 's bitch implying they were n't already ? 
  * cough * irak war * cough *, 
   were you happy with the election of alexander van der bellen as your president or we 're you pulling for norbert hofer ? 
  pretty much hate both choices , btw , check out my edit . 
  the uk had a less negative view of the eu then lets say ... uhm ... [ austria ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/bf4b822f28683ba7156d97da48e60fc6.png ) . 
  source : [ european commission - public opinion ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/index#p=1&amp;instruments=standard ) edit : and some countries ( lets say , [ austria ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/909b6619b91421ccb357f50a861534b5.png ) ) view immigration and unemployment as a bigger problem then other ( lets say , [ uk ] ( https://i.gyazo.com/5ead0cca7b10de5b85fd3c2189042967.png ) ) , that 's just a fact . 
   there is no eu rule that says you can not set your corporate tax to 1 % . 
  uhmmm ... https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/19/european-commission-overarching-corporate-tax-proposals-profit-shifting and it 's not like there around 26 eu members that would like to slaughter ireland for their 12.5 % corporate tax . 
  this is actually already a big deal inside of the eu . 
  actually , do you even remember the ireland - apple deal ? 
   a simple `` you follow my orders or you go to jail '' would be more than enough to get trump under control if you give him us-presidency as a bonus . 
  especially when he already left russia and there is no extradition between russia and the us . 
   if you give him us-presidency as a bonus . 
  there is only circumstantial evidence that supposed to show russian involvement , nothing real yet , but * fingers crossed * maybe !, 
  maybe putin is lex luthor . 
  i like how people see putin behind everything around the globe . 
  there 's a shadow behind you , it 's probably vlad , run !, 
  he 's some kind of omnipotent super villain with mind reading and mind influencing powers and he 's in it for the long run . 
  i mean , how amazing is it that putin made trump a billionaire , managed to give him a reality show and made it one of the most successful reality shows ? 
  also the dedication of putin , he 's working for decades just to give trump money , fame , wives , children , hotels , casinos , ... wow !, 
  tbh that 's a bit much . 
   there wo n't be much cock-blocking of legislation that you propose or if you wish to speed up ever-closer-union . 
  how can i get off this train ? 
  plz uk comeback , we need you as the fall guy . 
   d.j. 
  trump is no rational human being . 
  so , if he 's that stupid , and if he 's that irrational , how does he always get whatever the fuck he wants ? 
  how does that work ? 
  you think there is no plan , no logic , just `` gut feeling and a big mouth '' involved ? 
  that 's how you get 2-3 billions and the white house ? 
  i , personally , think that people are underestimating the orange man , he plays an act for the masses , plays the clown , gives the people what they want and in turn takes everything he can get to accomplish his goals . 
  it 's more like : i 'm leaving you for my ex ( us ) . 
  good luck . 
   that the eu is quite capable of giving the uk the finger and outright refusing so uhm , what if the uk turns to the us and they 're doing their own union ? 
  would n't they , economically speaking , be a lot stronger than the eu ? 
  with trump being such a yuge brexit supporter this is actually a very possible outcome , trump gave her the best possible negotiating stance . 
  brexit happens despite london , so much about that . 
   i think spain joining the euro was a mistake . 
  greece would like a word with u guys . 
  [ i 'm a prophet of the lord , duh . 
  ] ( http://www.businessinsider.de/yougov-support-for-scottish-independence-has-plummeted-since-brexit-2016-11?r=uk&amp;ir=t )  `` the problem for the pro-independence side is that somewhere between a quarter and a third of people who voted yes in september 2014 voted leave in june 2016 , '', 
   everyone thought ed miliband would be the new pm . 
  sort of like how everybody knew hillary clinton would be the next president . 
  idk , maybe i 'm stupid but i never thought that labour would win anything in the uk and i saw trump as a serious contender and once i realized that hillary did n't take him serious i actually thought that he 'd win . 
  except the uk actually left because the people wanted to and not the politicians who wanted brexit only as leverage against the eu and never thought it would actually happen . 
  sturgeon wants to leave , the people tho ... nah, 
   the right resort to mudslinging yes , thats only a right thing ... ahaha sorry you 're hillary-ous . 
   your reality is quite far off from the reality most of us here experience . 
  you 're from portugal and you do n't experience any crumbling ? 
  racist imf supports the racist brexit . 
  god damn racists . 
  neither are we . 
   purely so the tories can stay in power and the older generation who believe in glorious britannia and will hardly be affected by brexit can have the place be more white ? 
  i like how every eu sceptic must be white , racist , old oh and probably male . 
  ohhh , you 're a olympic mental gymnast now i get it . 
  actually had to google image search gypsies , because i had no idea how they 're supposed to look . 
  everytime i read or hear `` gypsies '' [ this image pops up ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/56/b5/b4/56b5b41eed2b11917f6dffa714e3afa1.png ) in my head . 
  apparently any negative word about immigration or the mentioning of negative side effects are shutting down every conversation , since lefties tend to stop listening . 
  oh god do n't tell me you 're one of those idiots who 's ashamed of everything thats coming from your country , even if its justified . 
  like you 've never heard of organized beggars ? 
  i mean , i 'm not from the uk and we have those gangs everywhere in our town . 
  there are reasonable and unreasonable complaints , the complaint about roma beggar gangs is very reasonable . 
  soo , the american girls are getting a surprise when they 're with you ? 
  what kind of weird ass argument is that ? 
  my country is small as fuck and we have different accents in every state . 
  like 90 % of the viennese people are completely unable to understand people from vorarlberg or upper austria . 
  it was food , but he made it without any sugar , it was supposed to be tasteless and give you no excitement so you 'd lose your sex drive . 
  so , the first cornflakes tasted like cardboard . 
  i mean , i was looking at the polls again after making my comment and i am actually shocked . 
  they 're leading the polls in vienna , that was fucking unthinkable a couple of months ago , i mean . . right now i ... 
  i ca n't even ... 
  uhm , according to the polls you 've got that one pretty wrong m8 . 
  i mean , another 15 % and they could govern the country alone without the need of any coalition . 
   as for the jews they hate them because israel ... yeah and the little fact that they would probably kill them if they entered a strict muslim country ... 
   because they are basically guaranteed to `` only '' end up in the opposition anyway this is how it has been in austria , but ... them came the year 2000 and the fp\u00d6 had enough votes ... 
   the greasiest looking fat fuck i 've seen but we 're not judging people by their looks or skin color anymore , are we ? 
  basically 4chan just on the other end of the political spectrum , but still slightly better than tumblr , that 's something !, 
   he let a few internet comments which are the most honest reaction since 99 % of the stuff here is anonymous , so if you want to know how `` your side '' thinks you 're exactly right here , these are the unfiltered and real thoughts of `` your people '' regarding `` real news '' and issues . 
  this is not a troll sub like / r/the _ 4chan uh i meant donald . 
   nothing wrong with that , but do n't blame us for it . 
  where does this `` collective thinking '' come from ? 
  `` us '' , lulz . 
  [ we are one , we are / r/europe ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/73/09/4e/73094e062316fa1224d2661b4c761a22.jpg ) ? 
  nah , the people in belgium know him ( former pm and shit ) , so the eu wide statistics would be lower than 90 % . 
  still , this shows that there are also positives things to farage 's juvenile behaviour . 
  i have to admit , i 've never heard of herman van rompuy before farage dragged him into the spotlight with his insult rant and i 'm willing to bet that if you ask people on the street 80 % would n't fucking know who the hell he is . 
  yea , but that 's kinda his appeal und makes him likeable for many people . 
  * look at him !, 
  he 's giving them hell !, 
  you tried , [ let me give you a hug ] ( http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/gettyimages-543391074-714x520.jpg ) and a [ little kiss ] ( http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eb7b/production/_90138206_mediaitem90138205.jpg ) . 
   a lot of so-called `` left-wing '' / `` remainer '' types are showing up claiming they had a change of heart because `` people are mean '' . 
  change of heart in what way ?
