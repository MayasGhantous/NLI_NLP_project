   there is obviously something christian about these markets what gave it away ? 
  the ave maria candles ? 
  the baby jesus statue ? 
  the angels ? 
  the fact that , at least in southern germany , they 're called `` christkindlmarkt '' which literally translates to `` child christ market '' ? 
  or was it one of [ those ] ( http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/krippe-lneburger-weihnachtsmarkt-in-der-altstadt-am-rathausplatz-picture-id177930903 ) ? 
  or is it the fact that they actually [ cosplay the fucking birth of fucking christ ] ( http://bc01.rp-online.de/polopoly_fs/1.629536.1303832224!httpimage/2998197169.jpg_gen/derivatives/dx510/2998197169.jpg ) at some of them ? 
   the point is , is this an attack on christians ? 
  i never said that , the point is that they 've attacked a christian gathering , not for the purpose of attacking christians , just because there are a lot of people . 
  i bet you go to medieval markets and tell them `` uhm , there is something medieval about this gathering '' . 
  guess there is something greek about your flair , it 's just something , i ca n't really pinpoint it , but it seems greekish to me . 
   i 'm pretty sure hitler 's genocide was in the pursuit of political aims i 'm pretty sure the genocide was his political aim ... 
  you post gives me night terrors , please delete your account and stop terrorizing me . 
  still not as many dead people as communism #nottheworstdictator, 
   actually , terrorists want people to change their behavior says who ? 
  its way more convenient if they do n't change it , more infidels to slaughter , more fun , more virgins in heaven . 
  i mean , it would be fucking horrible if people changed their behaviour and stayed at home , how the fuck are you supposed to run them over in their apartments ? 
  going door to door and stabbing people is exhausting as fuk ... 
  a place where people celebrate the christian holiday , christmas , the supposed birth of the christian lord ( spoiler : not his actual birthday ) and saviour jesus christ . 
  you can buy christmas decorations there , like jesus figurines , candles with the ave maria on them , cribs ( you know those with the little jesus baby in them and the 3 clowns who bring stuff to him ) . 
  definitely nothing christian about those markets , especially in germany . 
  huffpo , one of the biggest satire magazines . 
   there 's no way to close the borders for people with the will and resources to gain access . 
  it 's amazing how people can forget the udssr so quickly , i mean you could n't move from west to east berlin for decades , but hey , with all the new technology , surveillance and what not we ca n't secure a border anymore lmfao . 
  no wait , we 're just too cheap and too idealistic to secure the borders , looking at our politicians , i do n't think the `` idealistic '' part holds true , they 're just too cheap . 
  \\ #austeritypolitics, 
  build a firewall ? 
  i mean , first they did n't get along with christians in their countries and neighbour countries , after killing most of them they 're not getting along with each other , so ... maybe we can integrate them ? 
  some german courses and dating advice will probably help . 
  guess 2016 is just the beginning . 
  idk why this being downvoted . 
   people there are french . 
  those poor bastards . 
  uhm , no ? 
  we have a miss austria aswell and of course a miss `` everystate '' . 
  now go that map with male vs female suicides . 
  he 's also married , but `` secretly gay '' and could n't resist his gay urges anymore because he was `` possessed by the devil '' . 
   norway is outside of the eu thanks to the people , not like the government tried to get them into the eu a couple of dozen times . 
  you can argue as much as u want , but the people that profit the most from the eu are politicians . 
  worry about ? 
  i would n't be opposed to those ideas , but it 's just not doable . 
   wilders has among other things vowed to confiscate korans , close mosques and islamic schools , shut the borders and ban migrants from islamic countries . 
  people fall for that ? 
  that shit is n't enforceable and i thought our populists were bad ... 
   at least in his own mind proves it for me as well . 
  you can go f. . . yourself . 
  we 've teamed up in 2 ww 's and lost , vive la france . 
   to really simplify things , and picking random numbers . 
   stay put : risk of death 1/8  travel : risk of death 1/4 okay i do the same now : stay put : risk of death 1/2 travel : risk of death 1/4 so uhm , cool . 
  honestly , by plain logic and without hard evidence that suggests otherwise traveling to europe has to be the safer option especially since even babies and old people can make those trips ( yes we have those ), 
  just 25 bucks , but still , i won , lul . 
  i won !, 
  i literally bet money on vdb , cmon fellow austrians do n't fucking disappoint me , you love the status quo . 
   have some degree of confidence that the austrians are n't complete idiots i live here , i can assure you , the majority of people are fucking idiots . 
   i just have a gut feeling that this shit will end up with us killing each other all over again well , duh , does n't it always end up like that ? 
  guess you know who 's gon na win , huh ? 
  you 've been through that . 
   ** france ** and germany are the recognized ** leaders ** of europe now . 
  bahahahahahaha, 
   news agencies why would you ever listen to them ? 
  uhmm , fuck you and your sideways belgian flag . 
   although it is worth noting that there 's very little appetite for a second referendum right now , even amongst yes voters . 
  could you tell that nicola ? 
  right , le pen is n't happening , the afd is n't happening , my next president is n't going to be that fp\u00d6 fgt hofer , the fp\u00d6 is n't polling between 35-40 % , brexit does n't happen , orban does n't exit , poland is n't becoming a right wing country , we did n't build fences , ... , trump did n't win the us election . 
  as soon as shit gets uncomfortable we resort to nationalism , it 's a fact . 
  i have , people are totally utopian and want to help everybody until it gets slightly uncomfortable or they lose something like their jobs , then they go all nazi on ur ass , hence the european right drift . 
  the masses are retarded , as always . 
  tbh , no facts , just your assumptions , especially the traditional family part . 
   solve low birth rates assuming that low birth rates are actually a problem . 
  i 'm sorry , but it might be time to face the facts , that we 're living in the age of automation , that 60 % of our current jobs are not needed and are literally on live support ( automation taxes ... great idea ! ), 
  and the majority of our population is also `` not crucial or important '' . 
  thats what the romans said about that crazy jesus fella . 
  might want to point out the errors in his comment , because i 'm looking very hard but i ca n't find them . 
   in some ways i think it could be beneficial to have a smaller population right now ? 
  in almost every way . 
   most western woman are not interested in dating a refugee ??? 
  yes they are , a lot of college girls are not opposed to the idea . 
   politicians  backbone those are n't combinable , sorry . 
  he was making fun of your army . 
  like they can only send a soldier , one . 
  you 're missing his main point . 
   poland will send ** a soldier **, 
  which europeans do n't refrigerate their eggs ? 
  wtf is this nonsense ? 
  lifelong sentence is 22 yrs or so , he 'll be out once he 's 48 . 
   `` he 's as smart as an empty ashtray '' . 
  how smart is a full ashtray ? 
   their wronging was not that they killed without permission or by their own rules , but that they killed another human at all . 
  i hope you 're kidding . 
  people kill other people `` with permission '' on a daily basis . 
   it is pretty weird how we are so morally opposed to execution but we are totally cool with leaving someone in a room for the rest of their lives . 
  i do n't really know that execution is n't better than that . 
  i 've had the same thought , but then i heard the stories of people who were falsely imprisoned for decades . 
  makes you think , if you lock someone up you can set him free and compensate him , but if you executed somebody , well that shits kinda final . 
   do you remember anything about it ? 
  we 're on reddit , you 're probably talking to a 15-18 year old who definitely does n't remember that . 
   what is the opinion of french socialists about their current government ? 
  hollande 's popularity is absolutely disastrous and this requires serious self reflection . 
  afaik they do n't consider hollande as one of them anymore . 
  weird but that 's how they roll , it 's easier to cast someone out than to self reflect .
