  well , to each his own i guess . 
  not even jon stewart ? 
  concerning the topic of the ukraine civil war i gave up on / r/europe months ago already . 
  by now / r/europe is basically an interactive nato press release ... :(, 
  you must be fun at parties !, 
  hey / u/w00ster , thanks for the gold !!, 
  my first reddit gold !!!, 
  read it !, 
  it 's really funny !, 
  yeah i do n't think so . 
  for a children 's birthday party maybe ... , 
  nice , 
  like nutella ? 
  you may be onto something here ... , 
  i 'd say we win this one hands down . 
  thanks everybody !, 
  and armenia : wtf ? 
  best is in the netherlands : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/best,_netherlands, 
  some more latin phrases some germans might understand ... nomen est omen carpe diem cui bono deus ex machina in dubio pro reo in vino veritas mea culpa in medias res veni , vidi , vici, 
  all you examples are also part of the german language . 
  putin is spot on !, 
  this is fucking awful !, 
  i am lost for words . 
   the poor beleaguered ethnic russians who the fascist ukrainian government are starving and withholding medical supplies from . 
  obviously . 
   the red cross agrees with you . 
  but i guess they do n't think it 's funny ... `` it is urgent that aid reaches people in lugansk and in other areas in the eastern part of the country , which have sustained heavy fighting over the past weeks , '' said laurent corbaz , the icrc 's head of operations for europe and central asia . 
  `` the situation is critical -- thousands of people are reported to be without access to water , electricity and medical aid . '', 
  mike jackson refused to enforce clark 's orders , reportedly telling him `` i 'm not going to start the third world war for you . '', 
   maybe it 's just idiots against idiots . 
  i mean , cities that have two football teams have to put up with morons attacking each other . 
  sure and in that case we could say : here we have it . 
  21st century european football . 
  just what we needed . 
  i ca n't recall one case in history where economic sanctions achieved their goals and not had the opposite effect . 
  the nazis thought the could bomb london and the british empire into submission and make the civilians rise up against their government . 
  the very opposite happened . 
  later the british empire thought that this approach could still work if they just bomb nazi germany really , really hard . 
  but nope , it did n't work . 
  and the bombing was way worse than economic sanctions !, 
  but the idea is the same , make the civilians suffer to make them overthrow the government . 
  it 's just not going to happen . 
  it never did . 
  like / u/magadget said : it will only make putin stronger . 
  so why are our politicians talking about and enacting economic sanctions ? 
  because they are absolutely helpless !, 
  they have no answer for this conflict ( a conflict they also created ) . 
  but they ca n't admit that . 
  they ca n't just hold a press-conference saying : `` ok , we are lost . 
  we do n't know what to do . 
  we do n't want to start ww3 but we want to contain russia . 
  but we just ca n't . '', 
  our western politicians ( american and european alike ) have painted themselves into a corner . 
  it 's not that europeans love putin . 
  it 's just that a lot of us think that our own politicians are lying , hypocritical , stupid and naive assholes . 
  putin at least calls it as it is . 
  putin at least seems competent . 
  but that does n't mean people love putin , that just shows how fucking awful our politicians are !, 
  edit : thanks / u/politus, 
  thanks for posting this !, 
  i 'm gon na watch it now , sounds interesting !, 
  members of the far-right svoboda party hold the positions of vice prime minister , the minister of ecology , the minister of agriculture and the acting general prosecutor , etc. 
  the svoboda party was know as the ** social-national ** party of ukraine until 2004 . 
  this was their [ logo ] ( http://ntz.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/in-150x150.jpg ) , a modified wolfsangel rune . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social-national_party_of_ukraine the party has support in the west of the ukraine but almost no support in the east . 
  there you go : http://derstandard.at/2000001316139/der-marsch-der-identitaeren-am-samstag-in-wien,

  i am not convinced . 
  i still do n't think it would be a waste of taxpayer money . 
  i have to come back to my point about [ boeing vs. airbus ] ( http://norberthaupt.com/2012/04/29/boeing-vs-airbus-education-in-the-united-states/ ) and [ galileo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galileo_%28satellite_navigation%29 ) . 
  this is first and foremost a question of european self-determination and security interests . 
  and honestly i do n't understand why you are so against it . 
  does this suggestion sound like a threat to the ears of an american ? 
  or , to put it bluntly , what do you care ? 
  if fact you personally would probably profit from such a project , you do n't have to pay for it with you taxpayer money but you could still use it . 
  we here in europe would profit even more of course , new jobs , the company would pay taxes in europe and would have to follow european law . 
  and maybe , maybe , maybe it would make blanket surveillance of europe a little bit harder for foreign intelligence agencies , if we miraculously get politicians with a backbone . 
  great find !, 
  and a very interesting read !, 
  thanks for posting this . 
  btw . 
  i have no idea why you are being downvoted for just providing information . 
  now i want to read it . 
  but i cant find it on amazon . 
  there does n't seem to be an english ( or german ) translation . 
  is that possible ? 
  maybe it was published under another title ? 
  is this the russian version of zbigniew brzezinski 's `` the grand chessboard : american primacy and its geostrategic imperatives '' ? 
   the paper from the german-russian chamber of foreign trade , a group representing 800 companies that provides support to german firms operating in russia, 
  please hold this shit-bag for a second !, 
  i found it quit convincing . 
  but it 's controversial , that 's for sure . 
   i do n't sadly , but if you allow me :p google ftw !, 
  i never said google is not great !, 
    there lies my core disagreement yes , that 's where we disagree . 
  google is a problem . 
  this one us company is vitally important to the european economy . 
  and that is a problem imho . 
   i am from chicago .
