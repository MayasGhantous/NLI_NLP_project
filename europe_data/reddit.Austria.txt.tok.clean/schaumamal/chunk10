   when talking about the us wiretapping eu offices or merkel . 
  nobody cares about the us wiretapping eu offices or merkel . 
  ( well maybe angela ) . 
  europeans care about the comprehensive ongoing surveillance of european citizens . 
  the deliberate sabotaging of security standards on the internet . 
  about a paranoid , out of control , unchecked nsa . 
  i listened to obama 's speech - it was a fucking joke !, 
  a drunk giant who suffers from multiple personality disorder ? 
  let 's agree to not wake him up !, 
   and omg states pursuing their national interests ? 
  i 'm glad germany has n't done that with nordstream even though it posed a security/intelligence threat to sweden and can economically isolate poland & other eastern european states ( now russia can cut off gas to them without cutting off gas to the rest of western europe ) . 
  by the way , i wonder how schroeder is enjoying that gazprom job ? 
  lol oh please stop the scaremongering !, 
  russia cutting of the gas to europe is about as likely as china reclaiming it 's money from the us . 
  < quote  the largest foreign holder of u.s. debt is china , which owns more about $ 1.2 trillion in bills , notes and bonds , according to the treasury . < / quote  ok , schroeder is an asshole . 
  so , there are things we agree on !, 
  nothing to see here people , move along !, 
  the video is a black-and-white silent movie . 
  off you go !, 
  yeah , yeah , it 's always about military might . 
  if you have a hammer everything looks like a nail i guess . 
  another one who has n't watched the video ...  just because it furthers our national interests does n't mean we 're not there to protect you too . 
  now , is n't that convenient !, 
   this is something we totally want to be doing right now . 
  because when we 're trying to pivot away from our old cold war-era strategy of europe-first , the best thing to do is to keep having our resources and focus diverted back to europe . 
  well then fucking pivot away already !, 
  do n't let the door hit you on the way out . 
  alcohol was and always will be our secret weapon !, 
  you and / u/h33i0 should maybe watch the video before commenting !? 
  because moravcsik shoots down all you idiotic talking points !, 
  are you brainwashed or paid ? 
  europe is the second largest military power in the world and europe produces it 's arms domestically . 
  this whole europe is militarily weak drivel is bs . 
  a ignorant lie constantly disseminated by anglo-saxons , to justify us military presents in europe maybe ? 
  the us military is not in europe to selflessly protect it , it 's here to further it 's imperial agenda . 
  how naive do you think we europeans are ? 
  but not only that china is far , far away from catching up to europe or the us . 
  economically and militarily . 
  is this scaremongering or just ignorance ? 
  `` chinese juggernaut '' my ass !, 
  and not only that but for europe to have a strong military is not necessary . 
  ffs that 's exactly moravcsik 's point !, 
  this is the 21st century !, 
  he was right in 2010 and still is right in 2014 !, 
  and btw . 
  most of europe is completely unimpressed by this now so popular `` putin is literally hitler !!! '', 
  europe and russia have gone to war before ( a view times ) and both know what that means !, 
  such a war would be quit different from say , bombing some desolate third world nations into the stone age . 
  both know what 's a stake . 
  the fact that europe is stinking rich , that it prefers treaties over invasions and - let 's be frank here - the it is not the us enables it to successfully trade with the whole word , growing it 's economies even stronger . 
  not having to finance an huge military-industrial complex has it 's merits !, 
  europe is wealthier , more democratic and ** more secure ** because of it . 
  so please gtfo of / r/europe and back to / r/murica !, 
  german media and politicians try very hard and dutifully to say as little as possible about nsa 's extensive surveillance of germany . 
  ( just enough to not lose all credibility ) . 
  so , no reason for us official 's to complain here . 
  germany has absolutely no say in that matter . 
  as long as it 's in the interest of the us to have troops in germany there will be us troops in germany . 
  the us will leave if it 's not in it 's interest anymore . 
  what do the germans really think ? 
  hard question !, 
  a poll from january 2012 : west-germans : 39 % like the americans , 21 % do n't like the americans east-germans : 26 % like the americans , 34 % do n't like the americans another poll from june 2013 : ( when obama visited berlin ) 56 % of germans think that the german-american relations are very good or good . 
  13 % of germans think that german-american relations are not good or bad . 
  but in november 2007 , when bush was president : ( same article ) 36 % of germans think that the german-american relations are positive . 
  24 % of germans think that the german-american relations are negative . 
  again june 2013 ( same article ) 72 % of germans think americans are likeable/friendly 28 % of germans think america still is `` the land of opportunity '' 65 % of germans do n't think america still is `` the land of opportunity '' 10 % of germans agree that the us is a role model/example/standard for the western world . 
  65 % of germans do n't agree that the us is a role model/example/standard for the western world . 
  another poll from october 2013 : should talks about the transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the us and the eu be stopped ? 
  58 % of germans say yes 28 % of germans say no the reason given is the loss of trust following the snowden revelations . 
  another poll from november 2013 : 35 % of germans think the us is a partner that germany can trust . 
  in july 50 % thought that . 
  the drop is explained as a result of the snowden leaks . 
  another poll from january 2014 : 59 % of americans have an `` excellent overall impression '' of germany . 
  60 % of americans think that germany is a modern and forward-thinking society . 
  51 % of americans think that germany plays a stabilizing roll in europe . 
  47 % of americans think that germany furthers democracy and peace in the world . 
  41 % of americans think that germany plays a constructive roll in europe . 
  42 % of americans think that german-american relations are good . 
  48 % of americans think that german-american relations are neutral . 
  10 % of americans think that german-american relations are bad . 
  42 % of americans think that the germans like america . 
  20 % of americans think that the germans do n't like america . 
  the question is not offensive at all . 
  no , i really believe that those in power in germany display - to use savannajeff terminology - constant pro-americanism . 
  if you are interested in this kind of stuff check out : bbc - the pity of war was the great war a great mistake ? 
  harvard historian professor niall ferguson offers a different perspective on the first world war and argues that britain 's decision to enter the war was a tragic mistake . 
  official link : http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01nl00x no-so-official link : https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9681745/bbc_the_pity_of_war_720p_x264_aac_hdtv_, 
  move along citizen nothing to see here, 
  i totally agree !, 
  i submitted a post on that subject that i thought was quit good . 
  it got downvoted , dismissed and ignored . 
  it 's pointless . 
   constant anti-americanism ( which , i 'm taken to understand , has been very hip in germany for a while now ) , do n't worry mate , there is not a trace of anti-americanism to be found in german quality papers or on german tv-stations or radio-stations or anywhere in the `` serious media '' . 
  and the german government is unconditional loyal to the us government . 
  no worries there either . 
  the situation is under control . 
  is ukraine part of europe or not ?
