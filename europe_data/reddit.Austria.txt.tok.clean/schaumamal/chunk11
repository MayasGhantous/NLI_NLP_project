   when would you push the big red button ? 
  never !, 
  and that is why the cold war lasted 40 years and never got hot . 
  and that is why russia will not invade a nato or eu country and the us will not invade russia . 
  war between these two nuclear powers is just not possible . 
  they can fight some proxy wars in africa or asia if they fancy but there will be no war in europe . 
  but back then there were no nukes , right . 
  nato 's promise is : you attack one of us , we nuke you . 
  is n't that enough deterrent ? 
  yeah i know and i do n't doubt it . 
  it 's just that op said :  putting brits or frenchmen there is pointless since the entire idea is to force america 's hand ... . and then he went on about the need to spill american blood . 
  and then he got ( 94 | 20 ) up/down votes in / r/europe . 
  and the i thought wtf !, 
  and that 's all . 
  and that might not make much sense to you , sry . 
   pmc 's are unreliable , unaccountable , and expensive . 
  so are militaries . 
   a pmc has a direct interest in subverting democracy and forcing wars to happen , that 's basic business one could argue that a military also needs wars to justify its existents . 
   the us is already having massive problems with its military industry lobbying the hell out of the government and thinking only about profit , not what 's best for the country or the servicemen . 
  and that is exactly my fear . 
  a strong military has a strong influence on politics . 
  ( and politicians start to think they can play alexander the great !, 
  that actually maybe the biggest problem . ), 
   what you 're proposing goes much further than even that . 
  you want the defence of a democratic people to be put in the hands of undemocratic organizations whose primary objectives would be profit and potential gain . 
  even if the military is controlled by elected civilians it is still an undemocratic organizations whose primary goals are to grow and justify it 's existence ( via war ) . 
  if you have a huge military hammer every problem will look like a nail . 
  or something like that . 
  ( but i want to confess that my original post was not 100 % serious and that maybe i did n't think it 100 % through . ), 
  very good point !, 
  but does this still work nowadays ? 
  we need highly trained , professional soldiers . 
  special forces . 
  right now ( at least ) it looks like it 's not about quantity but about quality . 
  so a people 's army might no do the trick . 
  we would need a professional army . 
  and a professional army will always define itself in opposition to civil society . 
  this is great news !, 
  let 's do this !, 
  number one : germany demands a seat in the un security council !, 
  now !, 
  well then maybe europe could pay a nation which has a big army and an appetite for warfare ? 
  or what about blackwater & co. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category:private_military_contractors is n't the us in the process of privatizing parts of it 's military ? 
  concerning your second point : a military is always corrupt and there is always a lack of transparency , private or not . 
  at least it ca n't subvert our democracies if it 's just a service provider and not part of our societies . 
  this whole discussion is of course purely academic , i mean who would be mad enough to attack the eu !, 
  this would collapse the world economy and basically start ww3 ... 
  exactly !, 
  so there is basically no need for us troops to be in poland ? 
  and the entirety `` american blood needs to be spilt '' argument is bullshit ? 
  so it does n't ** really ** matter ? 
  i say , we europeans should continue to do what we do best . 
  spent money on education , so we can continue to invent , develop and produce high quality products . 
  then we sell them to the whole world and get filthy rich . 
  trade ftw !, 
  in the highly unlikely case that we need some military help , let 's just hire some mercenaries ... 
  but does n't that mean that nato is basically just a big bluff ? 
  the idea of nato as i understand it is this : know that if you attack one nato member , you attack all nato members and therefore all nato members will respond . 
  and now you are telling me that the us , which controls nato , might maybe , possibly , perhaps , under certain circumstances do nothing if poland is attacked ? 
  because ( except lucky canada ) all other nato members are `` a couple thousand miles away '' . 
  which should n't come as a big surprise if you are part of a `` north ** atlantic ** treaty organization '' . 
  americans can do sarcasm now ? 
  not bad !, 
  how very thoughtful and considerate of the us !, 
   the us was in the middle of free-trade negotiations with russia before this . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  the us and the eu are in the middle of free-trade negotiations !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transatlantic_trade_and_investment_partnership  the us would benefit more from free trade with russia than alienating it . 
  true , but the us does almost no trade with russia . 
   cut economic ties that 's simply not possible . 
  russia is the third trading partner of the eu and the eu is the first trading partner of russia . 
  i would n't mind at all if europe would build up her military capabilities !, 
  one way or another . 
  btw you did n't answer my questions . 
  what else can we do other then negotiate ? 
  go to war ? 
  so the eu should deliberately hurt it 's own economy in order to hurt russia 's economy ? 
  and you are saying that that would not weaken both the eu and russia !, 
  and to what end ? 
  to achieve what exactly ? 
  i think that 's a terrible idea !, 
  the us ( and china ) might like it though ... 
  the eu is the most important investor in russia . 
  it is estimated that up to 75 % of foreign direct investment stocks in russia come from eu member states . 
  also russia is the third trading partner of the eu and the eu is the first trading partner of russia . 
  if we want a strong eu we need to have good relations with russia . 
  like it or not , russia is our most important neighbor . 
  alienating russia is not in the eu 's interest . 
  the us on the other hand has very little to lose economically from deteriorated relations with russia , trade ties between the two countries are minuscule . 
  the eu is the most important investor in russia .

  thunderstruck ? 
  how to shoot yourself in the foot . 
  because moral superiority !!, 
  yea , well . 
  but i am talking about international law and not about our gut feelings . 
  those things are regularized and there is a very clear definition in international law what constitutes a invasion and what not . 
  oh , that 's your girlfriend ?
