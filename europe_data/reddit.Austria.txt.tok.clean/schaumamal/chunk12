  even if all those things you are claiming were true ( and they are n't ) , even then it still would not qualify as an invasion !, 
  look up the difference between an invasion , an annexation and an secession . 
  there was no invasion , crimea seceded from ukraine . 
   russia invades another european country what the fuck are you talking about ? 
  russia did n't invade an european country , you bloody fearmonger !, 
  i was replying to / u / globalbeat_minnesota 's comment . 
  he wrote :  ... elected representatives decide annually about how much money should be spent on spreading democracy ... and i ( charmingly ) objected to the imho naive idea that the us 's foreign policy is somehow altruistic and driven by high ideals ( like spreading democracy ) . 
  i just do n't believe that that 's the case !, 
  ( not now and not 70 years ago . ), 
  but you seem to argue that as a german i should just be thankful and shut up because - well basically - because hitler !, 
  is that 's what going on here ? 
  btw are you german ? 
  halt !, 
  we do n't want them either !, 
  let 's deport them to australia or america ... 
  no , i do n't think the us entered ww2 some 70 years ago to spread democracy in germany if that is what you are referring to . 
  hey you north-austrian !, 
  you better shut up or we will anschluss you again . 
  oops , my bad . 
  i thought the second map was of the entire ukraine too . 
  but it 's only the part highlighted in the first map . 
  now it make sense !, 
  the protesters and militia who seized government buildings in the west of ukraine , are they pro-russian or pro-western protesters ? 
   but dae hate uk ???!!? 
  naaa , just england . 
  no , not really . 
  i always liked the russian people and their culture . 
  and i always disliked the russian government . 
  hey globalbeat , i want you to listen to a podcast !, 
  you may have heard of dan carlin , he is best known for his `` hardcore history '' podcasts . 
  ( a must , if you are into history ! ), 
  i first heard of dan carlin here on reddit and i think he is really great !, 
  but he also does another podcast called `` common sense '' . 
  and there is one about the ukrainian crisis , it 's called `` poking the bear '' . 
  if you want to know what 's really going on in the ukraine you should take the time to listen to it !, 
  his podcasts are usually quit long , this one is almost 45 minutes , but they are really , really worth listening to !, 
  http://www.dancarlin.com//disp.php/csarchive/show-270---poking-the-bear/ukraine-russia-putin and hey , i too think that you americans are a great people , but every now and then i disagree with your government 's foreign policy ... greetings from europe !, 
  yay !, 
  have an upvote !, 
  imho the eu made a huge mistake supporting the us 's coup d'\u00e9tat in the ukraine . 
  either our european politicians are complete morons or the are remote-controlled by the us . 
  or both . 
  i really do n't know what they were thinking !, 
  if we want a strong europe we need to have good relations with russia . 
  how is that not obvious ? 
  i mean , like it or not , russia is our most important neighbour . 
  alienating russia is not in europe 's interest . 
  we should talk about trade agreements with russia and not about sanctions against russia !, 
  ( downvotes here i come ! ), 
   spreading democracy you 've got ta be fucking kidding me !, 
  is it possible to subscribe to some kind of mailing list at www.nato.int ? 
  i really do n't want to miss those important press releases !, 
  right , so now that we know how usaid operates , what should we make of the fact that usaid funded this public opinion survey in ukraine ? 
  thought experiment : would you trust a public opinion survey funded by an ** russian ** government agency that recently had to admit that it was conducting covert actions to overthrow foreign governments ? 
  or would you be a wee bit skeptical ? 
   the ap investigation revealed that the us government took great care to keep its role in the now-defunct zunzuneo hidden . 
  the programme was publicly launched in 2010 , using foreign bank transactions and computer networks . 
  the ap also revealed that draft messages produced were overtly political , despite earlier us government statements that the service had a more neutral purpose . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/senate-committee-cuban-twitter-usaid-zunzuneo us secretly created `` cuban twitter '' to stir unrest http://bigstory.ap.org/article/us-secretly-created-cuban-twitter-stir-unrest, 
  are we talking about the front for the cia called usaid ? 
  some info about austria : http://www.migration.gv.at/en/living-and-working-in-austria/children-and-education/studying-in-austria.html, 
  i am afraid i only found an article in german ( from a respected news site ) that talks about the secret nature of the visit . 
  brenan allegedly traveled under a false name . 
  his mission was secret and not intended for public consumptions . 
  america 's coup d'\u00e9tat in the ukraine was never in the interest of europe or the eu . 
  and i am pissed at all the european politicians who supported it !, 
  they should have gone to moscow , not to kiev . 
  if it was up to me , the us should n't be doing any `` heavy lifting on an european issue '' , but just gtfo . 
  if the us wants to play cold war with russia , fine , she can do that in the bering strait ... 
  if we want a strong eu , we have to have good relations with russia . 
  russia is an important neighbour , if we like it or not . 
  let 's be pragmatic here . 
  alienating russia is not in europe 's interest . 
  [ murica !, 
  ] ( http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/281/752/0fb.jpg ), 
  germany will do what 's in her national interest . 
  if trade with russia is in her national interest she will trade with russia . 
  period . 
  of course we all know that the us hates free trade , but germany is not the us and she can be bad this way . 
  not everybody is as selfless and self-sacrificing as the us , who just really , really cares about the ukrainians and their human right !, 
  like , you know , totally !, 
  please can i have a green card !, 
   you 're not concerned that the second largest nuclear power has started taking an interest in moving its borders ? 
  no , not terribly . 
  putin has n't suddenly lost his mind and is going full hitler . 
  putin is reacting to what has happened . 
  and only if you know what has happened can you evaluate russia 's reaction . 
  granted , without context russia 's reaction might look scary and insane . 
  but actually russia is acting very rational . 
  if you have some time to spare please listen to this podcasts . 
  they are from dan carlin , best known for his hardcore history podcasts . 
  this guy knows his shit . 
  http://www.dancarlin.com//disp.php/csarchive/show-270---poking-the-bear/ukraine-russia-putin http://www.dancarlin.com//disp.php/csarchive/show-272---vlad-and-dianne/cia-nsa-intelligence if you just want a quick fix , watch this youtube video . 
  http://scgnews.com/the-ukraine-crisis-what-youre-not-being-told after that i think you will judge putin 's actions differently . 
   i think we 're all a bit scared of russian at the moment , but i doubt that 's something to feel proud about . 
  who is `` we 're all '' ? 
  i am not scared of russia , nor is anyone i know !, 
   its the same sort of fear i 'd have towards someone who 's mentally unstable and holding a live grenade . 
  this analogy is so poor that it has to sleep under bridges . 
  you are mighty scared of russia , are n't you !?
