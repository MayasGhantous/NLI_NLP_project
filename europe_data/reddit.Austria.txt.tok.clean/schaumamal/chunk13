  ** ** watch out !!!, 
  ** the russian bear is right behind you !!, 
  are you out of your mind !? 
  finland is a member of the eu and closely affiliated with nato . 
  what are you going to claim next ? 
  that they will nuke california ? 
  tl ; dr outgoing figurehead of nato submits job application to arms industry . 
  i 've compiled all the anti-russian submissions on / r/europe right now , ok , only the first ten or so ... http://i.imgur.com/zcvfgwh.jpg so , to answer your question : no , not at all !, 
   then you have the germanic/romance/slavic split , and then europe reaches all the way to vladivostok . 
  right . 
  so that 's no really working . 
    and it does , in a sense . 
  i do n't think so . 
   huntington 's problem is trying to force permanent , clear borders into existence where there are n't any . 
  huntington is offering on possible interpretation . 
  here 's another map of his [ civilizations . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/clash_of_civilizations_map.png ), 
  yup . 
  and i think this was the sole reason why greece was invited to join the eu in the first place . 
  thanks for explaining !, 
  i think i get it now . 
  being sober again also helps . 
   i think your argument is in fact quit similar to huntington 's . 
  if i understand you right you are saying that nation states ( or political unions like the eu ) can over time de-blur ( or even create ) cultural boundaries ( via religion , language , law , etc. ) . 
  according to huntington that is exactly what happened . 
  he identifies the roman empire as the most formative cultural force in european history , projection it 's vastly superior civilization ( including christianity ) over a very , very long time and therefore leaving the deepest cultural imprints and borders . 
  and those borders are still recognizable and relevant today . 
  huntington admits that those borders are blurry . 
  found a map of huntington 's [ civilizations . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/clash_of_civilizations_map.png ), 
   i think that 's an arbitrary choice . 
  if you take language as the distinguishing criterium , you end up with borders elsewhere . 
  well , then show me the eastern border of europe using language as the distinguishing criterium . 
  we then can compare the two criteria and see witch one works better ... 
  i agree and i wo n't argue that point . 
  still , i think the video is kind of cool !, 
  well , samuel p. huntington does n't . 
  and i am not sure . 
  those countries have major difficulties getting ( or being ) in the eu . 
  there seems to be some major cultural differences . 
  and i am not bashing or judging those countries !, 
  i am not saying one is better than the other , or the eu countries are somehow better than non-eu countries . 
  but there obviously are some compatibility issues . 
  sorry , i do not understand your reply . 
  ( i blame the red wine i 'm drinking ( merlot ) , not you ! ) . 
  would you mind to rephrase ? 
  you sound bitter . 
  do n't like the germans ? 
  because i think religion plays a huge role in the cultural development of civilizations . 
  i do n't think this is `` just '' a border between religions ( or denominations ) , i think such a border almost always is also a border between civilizations . 
  religion is formative , no matter if modern day atheists like me like it or not . 
  according to huntington it can . 
  he goes way back in history to the split of the roman empire into the western roman empire ( roman catholic church ) and the eastern roman empire ( eastern orthodox church ) , arguing that both developed a distinctive civilization : the european kulturkreis and the russian kulturkreis . 
  i personally find his argument quit convincing . 
  ( and btw the ukraine is split right in the middle , half western half russian ... ), 
   ca n't wait to see the response from kremlin propaganda . 
  ca n't wait to see the response from white house propaganda . 
  ( and i am caught in the middle trying to figure out what really is going on ... ), 
  i agree . 
  in his book `` clash of civilizations '' , samuel p. huntington tried to define the eastern border of europe : here 's the [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fsow1g8.jpg?1 ) . 
  i tend to agree with him . 
  ( i scanned this page for another discussion here one reddit , might as well recycle it . ), 
  the argument for canada of course is that it is culturally very close to europe . 
  much closer than turkey or modern day israel . 
  well , thank you !, 
  btw i hold the record for the most downvoted comment is this thread right now !, 
  yep , i agree . 
  well i guess we just have to agree to disagree . 
  the way i see it there is a lot of propaganda ( including astroturfing ) from both sides of the conflict . 
  and i am caught in the middle trying to figure out what really is going on ... 
  i really do n't think there was . 
  the goal of the germanys [ ostpolitik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostpolitik ) always was `` change through rapprochement '' . 
  there was of course little love for the soviet union ( and it 's occupation of east-germany ) . 
  but ostpolitik was a different , pragmatic approach to the threat of the soviet union . 
  mostly spon , zeit.de , orf.at . 
  and it 's not just forum comments astroturfing , there are polls : http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article126545412/die-deutschen-gehen-auf-distanz-zum-westen.html, 
  i really hope your not suggesting that west-germany built the wall . 
  well maybe germans have a mind of their own ? 
  right now german media is almost exclusively anti-russia/pro-us , almost so much so that one could think they get their talking points directly from the white house . 
  but many germans realize that there is a lot of propaganda coming from both sides and they reserve their right to make up there own mind . 
  and there was never a `` red scare '' in germany ( but quit the opposite , `` ostpolitik '' ) , so just yelling `` beware of russia , the evil empire !!!! '', 
  might scare americans but not the germans . 
  [ nice read ] ( http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/augstein-zur-krim-krise-deutsche-journalisten-berichten-einseitig-a-961623.html ) ( for those who actually know the language ), 
  what would a pro-ukrainian comment look like ? 
  i thought there are only pro-russian and pro-us comments . 
  european capitals like belgrade ? 
  i know . 
  but i was talking about ukraine . 
  i did n't confuse the two countries . 
  you may know samuel p. huntington 's book `` clash of civilizations '' . 
  this [ map ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fsow1g8.jpg?1 ) is from the chapter where he tries to define the eastern border of europe . 
  he goes way back in history to the split of the roman empire into the western roman empire ( roman catholic church ) and the eastern roman empire ( eastern orthodox church ) . 
  i think this border does separate two distinctive civilizations . 
  ( and because of recent events : splits ukraine almost right in the middle ) . 
  i agree that `` russia is not europe '' and that russia should be considered a unique and distinctive civilization . 
  btw same is true for turkey imho . 
  of course europe , russia and turkey heavily influenced each other over the centuries but those three neighboring civilizations never really merged together but remained distinct . 
  not saying that this a bad thing or that on is better than the other . 
  this is just my ( non-judgmental ) observation .
