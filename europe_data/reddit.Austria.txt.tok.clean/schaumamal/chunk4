  those are well known dynamics . 
  let 's be honest here . 
  who needs luxembourg ? 
  ca n't we just abolish it and split it up between neighboring countries ? 
  the finns behaved quit germanic . 
  i do n't know if this is an insult or a flattery ... 
  so we austrians are supposed to be happy now ? 
  really ? 
  why do n't you all go fuck yourself !, 
  but hand me my prozac and my beer first !, 
  i think it was a gal not a guy . 
   it seems that europe has always been relatively demeaning towards america . 
  we europeans are just rude and cranky people , that 's all . 
  nope , but https !, 
  i see !, 
  well done !, 
  here is the mirror thread : why does europe dislike russia ? 
  absolutely right !, 
  who cares ? 
  nope , right-wing populism exists all over europe , no need for a nazi-past . 
   really ? 
  half our units in high school history were about our own atrocities and unfortunate historical events . 
  try growing up and going to school in austria !, 
  i agree , but also no forget that the ussr existed until 1991 . 
  such things need some time !, 
  yeah , ok , relax , that 's not very unusual when a country is in a crisis . 
  bush 's approvals ratings skyrocketed after he declared war on iraq for example . 
  and after 911 even more . 
  but in the end there was no real shift between democrats and republicans . 
  in a crisis people tend to stick together , that does n't mean much ... 
  thanks for sharing . 
  your comment is very insightful !, 
  greetings to russia from austria !, 
  yep , brace yourselves !, 
   you 're comment represents the mainstream narrative in the west and that demonstrates my point . 
  but , but , but you just claimed the opposite ? 
  how does this demonstrate your point ? 
  here is what i think : the people who are waving soviet flags in russia are on average 258 years old . 
  young russians do n't dream of a greater russia , they dream of an iphone 6 , an vw golf and tickets to a shakira concert . 
  they might not see the need to apologies for the ussr ( that 's probably a job for the next generation ) but i do n't think there is a imperialistic mood in russia . 
  things can change !, 
   the worst thing that has happened to ukraine was losing crimea , there were major western gas/oil corporations ready to go into crimea and set up massive gas operations in black sea with potential of maybe trillions in profit for the ukraine and could have been used to transform ukraine into a modern economy over the next 30-40 years . 
  naaa , natural resources never helped to develop a sound economy . 
  they just makes the super-rich ukrainian oligarchs richer . 
  pick any gas/oil producing country in the world as an example . 
  ( and do n't pick norway , ok . ) finding oil is more a curse than a cure for countries like ukraine . 
  ukraine is fucked on way or the other . 
  the question is will europe or russia or both pump money into this failed state . 
  one thing is sure though , the ukrainian oligarchs will get richer and the ukrainian people will continue to suffer . 
  one way or the other . 
  and we will freeze in the winter !, 
  everybody wins !, 
   the british , french , spanish , portuguese , dutch , belgians and americans have all worked hard to correct the shame brought on by their imperialist pasts and to reconcile with their former subjects . 
  really ? 
  have we ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  we ( the west ) should be a bit more humble in this regard and acknowledge that coming to terms with your past is a painful and long process , and that 's true for all of us . 
  there is still a lot of denial and repression going on in the west and i do n't see any moral high ground for us in this regard . 
  there is a lot the brits , the belgians and the americans can learn from the germans in this regard . 
  still , i totally understand that eastern europeans are not big fans of russian and i would never ever defend the soviets . 
  those countries belong to europe , not to russia . 
  but how about : belgium ignores leopold ii ? 
  i fear you got it all wrong . 
  read my comment again , please . 
   of course you as nation dont like jugos yeah , that 's why we organized the biggest aid programme for victims of the war in former yugoslavia ( `` neighbor in need '' ) and managed to collect 80 million euro from ** private ** donations up until 1997 to support the war-torn balkan . 
  we took in 115,000 people from croatia , bosnia-herzegovina and kosovo . 
  60,000 of those found a new home in austria . 
  according to the austrian statistical bureau , in mid-2006 , 814,800 foreigners legally lived in austria , representing 9.8 % of the total population , one of the highest rates in europe . 
  of these foreign residents , 305,100 came from the former yugoslavia . 
  and that 's why the germans said no to the war in iraq , because the knew the evidence was bs . 
  germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer talks about `` curveball '' . 
  ( english subs ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee_rnzrtzjy, 
   anyway , it is n't as if this was the bnd 's first big blunder there was no bnd blunder . 
  the bnd warned the cia , the cia did n't ** want ** to hear it . 
  bnd boss hanning even wrote directly to cia boss george tenet to tell him . 
  the problem was inside the us . 
  america wanted to go to war . 
   intelligence analysts who voiced concern were ` forced to leave ' the unit mainly responsible for analysing his claims , the us presidential commission found . 
  at every turn analysts were blocked by spy chiefs and their warning never passed on to policy-makers . 
   the other side are nationalist extremists ? 
  priceless . 
  members of the far-right svoboda party hold the positions of vice prime minister , the minister of ecology , the minister of agriculture and the acting general prosecutor , etc. 
  the svoboda party was know as the ** social-national ** party of ukraine until 2004 . 
  this was there [ logo ] ( http://ntz.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/in-150x150.jpg ) , a modified wolfsangel rune . 
  ( http://ntz.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/in-150x150.jpg )  membership was restricted to ethnic ukrainians , and for a period the party did not accept atheists or former members of the communist party . 
  the party also recruited skinheads and football hooligans . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social-national_party_of_ukraine the party has support in the west but almost no support in the east of ukraine . 
   the regime that tried to annihilate their country . 
  you 've got ta be fucking kidding me !, 
   there 's no reason for american merc 's to be there . 
  what a strange claim !, 
   not only does blackwater not exist because they changed their name they do n't exist anymore ? 
   but the kiev govt does n't have money . 
  there are a view super-rich oligarchs in kiev , one is running for president right now !, 
  even more victoria nuland said : `` we 've invested over $ 5 billion to assist ukraine in these and other goals that will ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic ukraine . '', 
  http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/2013/dec/218804.htm  with how much people are kidnapped there lately and held in a basement , why would we give them that opportunity to say `` see we found one ! '', 
  hubris maybe , i do n't know . 
   it was notably the bnd who handed over the notoriously deceitful `` curveball '' informant to the us defense intelligence agency , delivering the `` weapons of mass destruction '' justification for the irak war to the neocons around dick cheney , despite the scepticism of the cia . 
  it was exactly the other way around . 
  the bnd warned the cia several times that `` curveball '' was not trustworthy but the cia ignored it .
