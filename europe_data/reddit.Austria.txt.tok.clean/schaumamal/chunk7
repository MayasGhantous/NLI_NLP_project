  but i do n't think we are there yet . 
  in fact i think we are nowhere near this point . 
  there 's still more then enough room for diplomacy . 
  well not with that attitude it wo n't . 
   eu 's trade with russia is ~ 10 % of all eu trade and ~ 50 % of all russian trade ( mostly natural resources ) . 
  yes . 
  only the us ( 13,8 % ) and china ( 13,3 % ) are bigger trading partners of the eu . 
  and yes , the eu is very important to russia . 
   if we achieve energy union or will somehow become independent energetically from russia we could easily make economic pressure on them . 
  yes , but as i 'm sure we both know , that 's easier said then done and takes time . 
  but the eu should try to get as independent as possible from other powers . 
  not just concerning the question of energy . 
   if not economic sanctions , then what ? 
  diplomacy . 
  you know how it works , find common interests , try to create a win-win-situation , make a deal . 
  it 's done all the time , it does work . 
   this seems to be contradicting your last pdf http://www.statista.com/statistics/188637/united-states-direct-investments-in-russia-since-2000/ i do n't think so , but without the comparison to other countries it 's not very helpful . 
  on more thing the numbers in the second pdf are in millions of dollars , the numbers in the first are in billions of dollars . 
  also , we had fantastic growth rates after ww2 . 
  this is not a suggestion !, 
  the important question is wtf are quality paper journalists doing taking pictures and writing about a private birthday party !, 
  paparazzi much dear der spiegel ? 
  [ list of the largest trading partners of the european union ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_european_union ) [ list of the largest trading partners of the united states ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_the_united_states ) [ u.s. 
  direct investment abroad ( pdf ) ] ( https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/rs21118.pdf ) russia is so unimportant to the us in terms of trade and investments it did n't even make the lists . 
  russia is the third largest trading partner of the eu . 
  the eu is the largest trading partner of russia . 
  the eu is the most important investor in russia . 
  it is estimated that up to 75 % of foreign direct investment stocks in russia come from eu member states . 
  i do n't think what you want is even possible , let alone desirable . 
  i strongly oppose starting a trade war with russia , it 's just such a bad idea . 
  and i am totally not prepared to let the eu suffer any `` unfortunate economic downsides '' whatsoever . 
  absolutely not !, 
  sry , ukraine but charity begins at home . 
  fun fact : the us does almost no trade with russia . 
  therefore the us ca n't put any meaningful economic sanctions against russia in place . 
  and of course the us economy would n't be hurt by sanctions put in place by europe . 
  maybe it would even benefit from those sanctions ? 
  weak economic sanctions wo n't do anything and just be a political show . 
  strong economic sanctions will hurt europe 's economy almost as much as russia 's . 
  sanctions against russia are destructive and will get us nowhere . 
  imho we need a more productive , a diplomatic approach to solve this crisis . 
  [ nope . 
  but leo !, 
  my government takes the right stand ? 
  this is surprising . 
  as you rightly pointed out there has been no war in the last 65-70 years between the west and russia because of this `` nuclear armageddon '' thing . 
  and this is great news because it means that there will be no war between the west and russia now either !, 
  ( russia still has estimated 8500 nuclear warheads . ), 
  sooo , what exactly are those 150 us soldiers doing in latvia again ? 
  when was the last time the us missed out on a good war ? 
  and a word war at that !, 
  no way the us could resist !, 
  such a temptation . 
  my argument is about the power and influence monopolies have . 
  and that 's especially true for google i think . 
  i do n't think that really matters ... 
  even if the consumers more or less freely decided to only use google despite having other options it 's still now a de facto monopoly and that 's always a problem ... google is getting way to powerful , and needs to be curtailed . 
  i checked with wikipedia , russia does n't seem to be at war right now ... 
  just imagine what would happen if little nato member lativia runs into trouble and the mighty us would do nothing ( except talking about unfulfilled treaty obligations ) !, 
  this would not only be the end of nato , it would be the end of all us-european relations and it would be the end of us 's credibility globally . 
  ( the little that is left . ), 
  no , that 's not the point . 
  not at all . 
  those are not drip-wire troops . 
  latvia is a nato and an eu member . 
  latvia itself is a `` trip-wire country '' , there is no need for 150 us troops to be there . 
  in the very article the ministry of defence of the republic of latvia raimonds vejonis is quoted saying : ** there are no direct military threats to latvia and the baltic region , ... ** so , why are they there ? 
  it 's all a show . 
  it 's political theater . 
  it 's about politicians who want to present themselves as strong and powerful playing on the fears of the population ( fears they themselves helped to create in the first place . ), 
  and it 's of course about america 's favorite role : protector of the free world . 
  so , captain america is doing some dick swinging . 
  it 's utterly unimportant . 
  if anything it undermines the promise of nato and shows putin that in regard to ukraine the west is so helpless right now that it has to resort to ludicrous and empty gestures . 
  it 's propaganda bullshit . 
  and / r/europe enjoys every little bite of it . 
  yummy !, 
  what about the upcoming elections ? 
  right now it looks like the `` chocolate king '' will win . 
  what 's your take on that ? 
  do you think anything will chance if he gets elected ? 
  and what 's your take on svoboda ? 
  how radical are they ? 
   well , it 's though to say . 
  what is more binding : the democratic will of the voters or contracts/treaties signed by the government in the past ? 
  this is a really great question !, 
  so i googled it . 
  looks like this question came up first some 2500 years ago in ancient athens . 
  i confused you with op ( who started all this by making this claim ), 
   so nato is basically just a big bluff ? 
  welcome to the downvote train !, 
  they underwrote a defence treaty !!!, 
  i do n't give a fuck about their domestic issues !!, 
  this is such a bs argument !, 
  this is political theatre and nothing more . 
  i do n't know how to respond . 
  so nato is basically just a big bluff ? 
  does putin know ? 
  and ? 
  feeling safer already ?
