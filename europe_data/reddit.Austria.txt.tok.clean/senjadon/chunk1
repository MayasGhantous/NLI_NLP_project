generally speaking i 'm against an eu army . 
  however under certain conditions i would n't have a problem with it : - the army must act as a neutral force to protect the eu . 
  - the eu member states have to practise a neutral foreign policy themselves . 
  - the eu member states may not be part of any other military organisation outside the eu . 
  some of this might sound a bit weird . 
  but let me explain : 1 ) now , the first point is n't that difficult to make sense of . 
  the eu is a peace keeping union and we must not participate in wars and local conflicts outside the eu as it 's not our buisiness . 
  2 ) to me that sounds logical . 
  because it would n't make sense to me if the eu army has to remain passive though the single member states do n't and if they get in trouble the eu army steps in and protects them against the consequences of the countries ' own foreign affaires . 
  to me an eu army would also mean one common foreign policy . 
  3 ) with this point i particularly talk about eu members who are also in nato having to quit it . 
  the reason for this is that nato is an artifact from the cold war between the us and the soviet union . 
  it was all about dominating europe and defending the allied or occupied lands . 
  this lead into this circular mindset which makes you fear the opponent 's army and makes you gear up as well , which will make the opponent fear your army and so on . 
  the only way of breaking through this would have been if europe declared no longer to participate in that game and end the west 's and east 's efforts to dominate/influence it . 
  but this is n't what happened . 
  the soviets devided but nato lived on . 
  and the purpose behind it did n't change . 
  the main reason for why countries still continue to join it is the fear of russia . 
  in my opinion the eu could be an opportunity to finally end this by turning europe into a neutral defense block . 
  this would de-escalate with russia and make europe a safer continent .

  that 's the reason for why nato still exists . 
  though because it would lead into a war we should replace it with an eu army instead . 
   ... face the fact hat neutrality does not really exist . 
  why ? 
  is it because countries can practise a neutral foreign policy even without being neutral on paper ? 
  generally speaking i 'm against an eu army . 
  i live in a neutral country and our troops are not supposed to act outside our borders . 
  however under certain conditions i would n't have a problem with it : - the army must act as a neutral force to protect the eu and may only act on eu land . 
  - the eu member states have to practise a neutral foreign policy themselves - the eu member states may not be part of any other military organisation outside the eu . 
  some of this might sound a bit weird . 
  but let me explain : 1 ) now , the first point is n't that difficult to make sense of . 
  the eu is a peace keeping union and the best way not to put it 's members in trouble is not to participate in wars and local conflicts outside the eu .

  the main reason for why countries still continue to join it is the fear of russia . 
  in my opinion the eu could be an opportunity to finally end this by turning europe into a neutral defense block which is militarily independent from both sides . 
  are n't they ? 
  because russia fears that the ukraine leans towards the west , also militarily . 
  and a symptom of that is the association agreement i have mentioned . 
  this is how cold war strategy works . 
  it 's just stupid . 
  nato countries do n't enlarge their terretory . 
  they enlarge nato as a whole . 
  the us ' miltary is just insane as i have already explained . 
  we should n't even try to approach the amount of money they spend on it . 
  it 's just a complete exaggeration . 
  well , the uk does also have nukes but they might quit the eu . 
  we just have to see to what extent . 
  usually every member has to spend an amount equal to about 2 % of it 's economy 's gdp on nato . 
  the us pays 3.61 % ( total of 679 million usd ) . 
  however , european nato members mostly pay less than the 2 % limit , which is why in total figures europe as a whole spends only 238 million usd on nato . 
  but becuase the eu 's economy is actually bigger than the us ' one we could easily afford to pay the bill even without the us . 
  and do n't forget that by breaking the circular thinking that continues to arm and frighten the oponent ( who then gears up as well , which frightens us ... ) we can de-escalete the dispute with russia and save money . 
  not really . 
  but it would only defuse the fear of getting invaded which lead to the invasion in the first place . 
   ... , and it 's up to the ukrainian people to decide which trade block and miliary alliance they want to join . 
  it is indeed . 
  i am just arguing that they have made a poor choice . 
  especially countries that share a border to russia should think twice about which countries they want to do military exercises with . 
  they could have been a bit more foreseeing . 
   but , even though the moves they take on the geo-political chessboard are inacceptable , they are still understandable from a wider perspective . 
  i reject any form of agression . 
  both on the sides of the us and russia . 
  of course they are and they have to be called out for that as well . 
  this is not how long-term foreign policy works and the saudis are not friends we want to make . 
  however , still the us are the biggest supply of weapons to the middle east and especially they have to be held accountable . 
  yes , of course . 
  there 's no reason to deny that russia has attacked another country and annexed a part of it . 
  this act was brutal and inacceptable .
