  i ca n't imagine it would work . 
  to many different identities , which i can see leading to problems , as it has in the past . 
  obviously the governing bodies would try to be as diverse as possible , having , for example , a czech head of state will most likely end up being problematic in the more distant countries . 
  spaniards would n't feel well represented . 
  i prefer r/aeiou, 
  no need for hooligans when you have shakira patrols, 
  every fucking time ... 
  austria 's a little better at the french pronunciation , but i do n't speak french so i ca n't actually say how close it is . 
  it sounds closer though, 
  they would notice , i think , bit they would n't point it out, 
  for most people i would say one of the only unpeeled potato dishes is a jacket potato . 
  i hardly ever peel potatoes though , unless the recipe does n't work without peeling them, 
  why not though ? 
  in that case germany is my answer, 
  well yes , but that song popped straight into my head as soon as i read the question . 
  literally the first song that came to mind !, 
  understatement of the year . 
  and its not even february jet, 
  and triest itself . 
  nice port . 
  but yes mainly sea access, 
  triest would n't be bad to have back, 
  yeah and you can make nazi jokes , if you like that sort of thing . 
  goosestepping around and saluting for a laugh is n't exactly recommended though, 
   is it because its ~ ~ so similar to ~ ~ your place ? 
  ftfy / s, 
  you ca n't really translate ` spinnen ' as ` spider ' . 
  you would n't translate ` du spinnst ' as ` you spider ', 
  also do n't go around jokingly doing nazi shit . 
  should be common sense , buuuuut ... 
  i really do n't think you can say ` they ' do n't . 
  a lot definitely do, 
  wow , now i hate haider as much as the next rational guy , but wishing death on someone or rejoicing in their death is a little over the top . 
  unless they stalin , hitler , pol pot , et cetera, 
  i see, 
  firstly , it is n't `` entirely '' down to that , and that still does n't mean they preferred to marry to gain power instead of conquer, 
  i never claimed otherwise , i only pointed out that the did n't  really love war, 
   preferred not `` never fought a war '' xd, 
  yeah , hardly any country can beat austria when it comes to smoking . 
  we even elected a president who smokes rather a lot, 
  for nightlife berlin is arguably better than these . 
  but i 'm not a big nightlife guy so i ca n't actually speak from experience, 
  walters world is pretty cool , but sometimes i find he has absolutely no clue what he 's on about, 
  none taken  it 's a little odd because spanish is usually seen as a rough language as well, 
  i 'll let you have this one as your username makes me think you are ( almost ) one of us, 
  actually they preferred to marry of their kids into other royal families , so to avoid wars but still gain territory/influence `` tu felix austia nube '', 
  and that our language is infinitely better than our neighbours ' language to the north, 
  alhough it is n't an austrian production the sound of fucking music . 
  i ca n't go to salzburg without half the town being aimed at international tourists who want mozartkugel and the sound of music, 
  i 'd say lorry , flat , to let/for rent interchangeably, 
  i am going to be controversial and say kafka , and if that 's not allowed then wolf haas . 
  for europe as a whole it 's a close tie between tolkien and pratchett , obviously, 
  also for austria : es wird scho glei dumpa, 
  i like everywhere really , but the dolomites are just astounding, 
  ** switzerland ** : thanks for the chocolate , being our neutral buddies ( albeit a lot longer ) , and your accents ** germany ** : thank you for sandals and socks . 
  also for taking all the blame for hitler . 
  it is appreciated . 
  ** czechia ** : thanks for your beautiful country , our long history together , cheap beer and weed , and your pornos in which you pay women 10 $ to have sex in a park . 
  ** slovakia ** : thanks for a lot of similar things to czechia . 
  but also for bratislava being right on the border . 
  hungary : thanks for l\u00e1ngos and a really weird language , seriously , wtf is up with that . 
  also , sadly , for dealing with the refugees more extremely than us , so that the limelight was not on us to see us fuck up . 
  ** slovenia ** : thanks for being so culturally intertwined with the south of austria so that the border is a slow gradient , also the cheap fags . 
  ** italy ** : thanks for fine cuisine , beautiful landscapes , great language , and the warm weather that occasionally reaches us . 
  and also for taking some tyroleans off our hands , you can only deal with so many . 
  last but not least , ** liechtenstein ** : eeeerm ... 
  thanks for renting your entire country , i guess . 
  i was going to post a pic of the true austria , but your pic is definitely better, 
  well i went there to party but not in clubs or bars . 
  with beer and vodka at our house, 
  no matter how empty the bottle , there are idiots who are teachers . 
  in school i had german , english , spanish , and russian . 
  my russian has degraded though , so i can understand it but not speak too well anymore . 
  not hugely , but there 's at least one team in all the capitals of the bundesl\u00e4nder and some more in larger towns . 
  it 's very popular with foreign students , which we get a lot of, 
  i played rugby with a guy from s\u00fcdtirol and thought he was from tirol . 
  i think a lot of people assume them austrians without even thinking about it . 
  there is n't really a strong movement , there or in austria , to have them join austria again , as they 've got a pretty sweet deal going on . 
  people often joke about it being austria and the good old days when s\u00fcdtirol is mentioned , but it 's not really a topic discussed often , if at all, 
  oh this one . 
  well it just pisses me off really . 
  they brought in a law a couple of years ago that made it so that of you have a smokers area it has to be separate from the other part , which i find really nice because no one in their right mind wants to smoke or be smoked at while eating . 
  so a lot of places built these extra areas or just built divisions in their establishment , at their own cost i seem to remember . 
  and now that they want to get rid of it all together is a joke really . 
  it wo n't change anything imo . 
  i never smoked in restaurants anyway and i know so few people who did that all it 's going to do is make people slightly annoyed, 
  i disagree with banning smoking , i even did when i was n't a smoker . 
  i just find it disgusting that so many young people , who know how vile it is , still do it . 
  something like half of young male adults smoke . 
  i know i 've only got myself to blame for being included in that statistic , but it was definitely made easier for me . 
  but luckily innsbruck is lit af anyway so who needs a golden roof, 
  but that is literally the best game in the world so you 're not so bad, 
  obviously , 
  no worries , i was joking about your username, 
  do you have a strange hobby ? 
  not even based . 
  they are literally the same saint , only celebrated slightly differently, 
  anything but german accent i guess, 
  this is the view from my window in the morning http://imgur.com/gallery/q0pzt, 
  farid bang ?
