i still like you guys . 
  now get back on track !, 
  the habsburg curse . 
  coming soon to a theatre near you . 
  our werner has had [ an eye ] ( http://imgur.com/vbhlmnh ) on dear angela for a long time . 
  should be any day now !, 
  they need 190 relations with us in order to anschluss , ca n't have that negative impact . 
  lol , on point . 
  theyre being rated # 1 if elections were today , about a third would vote for them . 
  next month the vienna elections are coming up , then we 'll see how things stand . 
  b-but . . 
  need a fastlane to istrien !, 
  it 's gone buddy . . let it go . 
  honestly ? 
  czech republic at 21 ?! ... 
  edit : ah , descending area . 
  now i 'd like to see an objective hot-pornstars-per-capita statistic . 
  apart from the media trying their best to portray the opposite , the majority is on hungary 's side i 'd say . 
  austria is having time to breathe , need a refill !, 
  not only did he score the worst result of any sp\u00d6-parteichef but he also managed to score the worst overall result for the center left party sp\u00d6 since 1945 . 
  [ here are the results since 1945 ] ( http://www.wien-konkret.at/uploads/pics/ergebnisse-nr-wahl-1945-2013.jpg ) the political landscape was only red or black for a long time . 
  and as the \u00d6vp did n't manage to not-fuck-up the situation back then ( they had some major fuckups in the early 2000s when they coalitioned with the rightwing fp\u00d6 ) , the sp\u00d6 prevailed . 
  it really was a choice between two + bad options . 
  failmann is at it again . 
  media is a joke right now . 
  on the one hand they accuse russia of the most fucked up and onesided media a nation can have and on the other hand all you see is what they want you to see . 
  signed . 
  found this nice chart showing the statistics for austria ( 1947-2015 ) and added the governments projected 85000 austrian asylum requests . 
  find the chart [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ud31swl.jpg ) fyi : austria 's population is approx . 
  1/10 that of germany . 
  there is his [ offer ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34235739 ) but we lack official response . 
  i guess we have to trust this john . 
  john , elton recently took the first step . 
  putin obviously followed suit . 
  no fake . 
  nah , our politicians are predictable . 
  do as germany says . 
  bringing order into chaos . 
  livestream from nickelsdorf : http://dev.uvp.apa.at/player/jwplayer/16ca8f21-2ea7-417e-bd99-7151c5c76d36, 
  there will be closed borders . 
  give them some time , austrian politicians are slow . 
  problem is that the austrian border at the east is not as easily defendable as its western border to germany ( alps ) . 
  without a proper fence at least - and fencing off another eu country will be the nail on the coffin . 
  this combined with refugees welcome looks like an invitation to me . 
  nah , the line doesnt end on the border . 
  we get along pretty well with bavarians . 
  amazing , isnt it ? 
  i disagree about the not possible to cross part . 
  the saalach in salzburg isnt the broadest river , even the salzach could be crossed . 
  we might see several deaths though . . 
  goddamn , this is all playing into the hands of the wrong parties . 
  good luck with a right wing austria . 
  austrian border control will come as well , kurz just said something along the lines of it . 
  ah , of course . 
  thanks !, 
  well , we 've had \u00d6vp partner with them back in the early 2000s . 
  just this year the sp\u00d6 formed a coalition with the fp\u00d6 in [ burgenland ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/landtagswahl_im_burgenland_2015 ) . 
  i do n't think anyone would be forming a coalition nationwide , though . 
  it 'll be interesting how long the current parties will endure without re-elections . 
  concerning the fp\u00d6 , [ 2013 ] ( http://www.nationalratswahl.at/bild/ergebnisse/ergebnisse-nationalratswahl-oesterreich-bis-2013.jpg ) was close , but 2013 was before all the migration . 
  they were dealt superb cards and should an election happen now , they 'd probably [ win ] ( http://neuwal.com/wahlumfragen/stream.php?cid=1#facts ) . . 
  working remote as a freelancer and enjoying portuguese beaches ? 
  yay us !, 
  quite a big bunch of refugees sleep in camps , not in heated houses . 
  with the big influx of refugees the time until they get their asylum and adequate housing will simply increase . 
  austrias and germanys winter can be ugly if it gets cold . 
  usually , we do all we can to catch up to germany . 
  if we 're ahead of them in some aspects and they copy us , we 're \u00fcber-happy . 
  this time they seem to be convinced that 99.5 % will move on to paradise . 
  hooray !, 
  the bad press hungary gets right now is crazy and undeserved . 
  do it the one way and be called sloppy + ignoring eu rules , do it the other way and be called racist . . 
  i dont know , but i never felt a bad association with the word lager , except when used in combination with ns wording . 
  could be that im wrong , but i dont think theres a difference between austria and germany as a whole , quite possibly its a rather north vs south thing . 
  what else do you call your basecamp on a hiking trip ? 
  yes . 
  shouldnt be different in ` german ', 
  population wise x10, 
  the end . 
  there are areas where swedish people make up a large part of the nightlife industry ( they own large clubs with nearly all bartenders being swedish ) , but as you said thats the not-vienna part and in the alps . 
  that czech rep. !, 
  now if those refugees who arrive in turkey would be resettled ( the eu actually helping turkey ) you could compare these two situations ( todays vs 1956 ) , as that takes away the need to risk your life trying to get to europe . 
  technically speaking 51 years , 1867 , which coincides with prussia kicking austria out of the cool-kids-club, 
  the newspaper that published this image in austria ( krone ) is facing quite a big amount of criticism for doing so . 
  a newspaper doesnt come with a warning after all . 
  then again nobody follows skiing . 
  no , no , thats not how it works . 
  seriously ? 
  history should 've taught us something about slaughter houses . . just because there 's no label on it does n't mean it 's not there . 
  quick google translate : it was on thursday at about 11.30 clock , when a patrol of burgenland police truck noticed in a breakdown bay on the a4 , the east highway , in the direction of vienna before departure parndorf . 
  when police stopped to see what 's up , it discovered several dead refugees in the truck . 
  as the police said in a first press conference , should all the refugees who have been in the back of the minibus , be smothered . 
  the death toll is still unclear , the police speak of 20 to 50 people . 
  the driver continues to be missing . 
  an investigation of the police with hungarian colleagues is running . 
  a crisis team has been set up . 
  interior minister johanna mikl-leitner ( \u00d6vp ) was shocked . 
  she spoke of a `` dark day '' . 
  your thoughts are with the victims , families and friends . 
  `` tractors are criminals .
