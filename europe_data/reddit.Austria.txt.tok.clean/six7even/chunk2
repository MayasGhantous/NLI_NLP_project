  they have no interest in the wellbeing of the refugees . 
  only the profit . '', 
  by 18 clock , there will be another press conference about the incident . 
  austrias q1/2015 statistics are nowhere near as high as hungarys , before 2014 i think austria had more all the time , but the last year changed everything . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/1/19/first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_q1_2014_%e2%80%93_q1_2015.png edit : wow seems to be mostly kosovo guys http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/bd/five_main_citizenships_of_first_time_asylum_applicants%2c_1st_quarter_2015.png, 
  now if you put a per capita statistic on that map , austria is not that far off from the top . 
  i 'd say the good outweighs the bad by a lot . 
  interesting . 
  germans seem to enjoy the left lane and clog it up while in austria . 
  i always thought they 'd do that at home aswell . 
  austria will introduce the same system next year . 
  time to get a bigger wallet !, 
  [ die deutsche kochschau ] ( https://youtu.be/wgpgsycreja ) anschluss never stopped ( german only tho ), 
  western europe . . that 's . . 
  emotional !, 
  i do n't know , [ history ? 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/18/nsa-surveillance-germany-could-teach-us ), 
  until the asylum process is finished i think . 
  traiskirchen is filled to a point where practically everyone is saying something has to change . 
  damn it . 
  this is balkan funk !, 
  been to a chechen wedding in austria a few weeks ago . 
  was weird , but some people even talked to me . 
  mix of friendly and alienated , didnt really feel very comfortable . 
  the guy i talked with was really nice , didnt talk about his background in cechnya though , i guess he was too young when they arrived . 
  austria is super safe , where in austria will you be studying ? 
  mateschitz ' only owns 49 % of red bull , the other 49 % are with his co-founder ( +2 % son ) in thailand . 
  got a source on that ? 
  take that !, 
  austria seems to have changed from a country where sudern is a national sport to one where the youth is the most satisfied . 
  strange times . 
  take me with you !, 
  ah , good old g\u00f6rz . 
  2115 at the congress of vienna ii . 
  right after switzerland went crazy and tried to conquer savoy . 
  annexations had to be made . 
  austria-hungary tired . 
  must sleep . 
  it looks cheap though . 
  it 's almost the same as [ kerry coming in with new shorts ] ( http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/32260507407/us-flag-hiphop-loose-casual-haren-sports-men-costume-pants-plus-size-american-flag-pants.jpg_250x250.jpg ), 
  in being part of the flag . 
  i think it was meant as an edit . 
  misleading , though !, 
  it even has its own russified independent micro-province of transnistria !, 
  you are entitled to 25-30 vac days depending on your years of experience . 
  these are paid , you can choose the time of these , although the employer has to agree to that date , i think . 
  for smaller businesses , theres usually company holidays , where business is closed for lets say two weeks , paid . 
  normally a boss will ask his employees when the best time for that would be , but he can also just define it himself ( again , usually only in smaller businesses where one employee is more valuable to everyday work than in a bigger one ) , no longer than 2 weeks of company holiday though . 
  on top of that , you get around 13 national holidays like christmas and so on , paid . 
  the amount depends on if the holiday is on a weekday or not . 
  from what ive read this was the standard way of talking about other people , mostly dialect , even in bavaria . 
  but standard german is replacing more and more of it . 
  keep it going , m\u00fcller hans !, 
  youd rather go like `` m\u00fcller hans speaking '' although the use of that has been declining steadily edit : heres a link on that : http://sagso.com/2013/07/21/sagt-man-den-vor-oder-den-nachnamen-zuerst/, 
  so much text , he must be right !, 
  upon further reading , is it coincidence that austrians put surname first as well ? 
  but where was franz ? 
  am austrian , can relate . 
  which is kind of the same thing , is n't it ? 
  imo there should be one road toll for the eu as a whole , having the amount of stickers on my car reduced to 1 again will be a welcome sight . 
  i just do n't get it why they 're not just going to tax all the people ? 
  worked for us , no revolting occured . 
  then again we 're bad at revolting . 
  i especially like the way they stated that there simply will not be any compromise between sunshine and rain . 
  relax . 
  thanks for coffee and kipferl !, 
  and once again one right wing austrian manages to bring down parts of europe . 
  thanks haider . 
  sleepy lemberg . 
  your `` hundert '' made me google if czech people say hundert . 
  i was wrong . 
  we call that a `` pr\u00e4sentierteller '', 
  theres a d\u00f6ner kebab and then theres a d\u00fcrum kebab , but maybe thats just us austrians trying to build bridges and stuff . 
  they were well on it , not just planning . 
  obey , it 's the law !, 
  * whip *, 
  its the same for us strip clubs , its a dude handing you a paper towel . 
  in germany usually they clean the toilets tho . 
  this . 
  i 'd pay the same and still use uber if it was available in austria , the regular cab service seems like its from the 70s - plus a cab driver can scam you by driving silly routes - in an uber you see the route and know he 's just going where gmaps tells him to . 
  i guess my / s didnt get through ( ;, 
  he never said there would be no wall . 
  when shit hits the fan he 's gon na close that border - or those people will arrive and pile up at the austria-germany border , which will ofc be closed . 
  land of kant sounds smoother . 
  how serious are they about that seperatist thing ? 
  is there anything close to a real movement in the population ? 
  you mean something like this ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cross_of_honour_of_the_german_mother obviously that would be nazi . 
  east tyrolian beaches are the best beaches . 
  they are against the sanctions and are pro-russia . 
  says that she was born in estonia https://www.vanderbellen.at/zur-person/ edit : her name , alma siebold , suggests a rather german heritage i 'd think ? 
  sure thing we 'll anschluss you . 
  you can call us ubergermans if you want , now that you got rid of prussia . 
  will be close , as \u00d6vp voters may vote for hofer and griess voters may switch to hofer as well . 
  idk , he stated that in an interview . 
  it says 52 % of votes are counted - but those numbers are predictions that - from what they said - may jump up or down 4 percent , so hofer will be 1st while vdb and griess will battle for number2 . 
  first preliminary result from 17:00 hofer ( fp\u00d6 ) 36.7 vdb 19.7 griess 18.8 hundstorfer ( governing party sp\u00d6 ) 11.2 khol ( governing party \u00d6vp ) 11.2 lugner 2.4 update : hofer 35.3 , vdb 21.3 , gri 19.0 there will be another vote with the top2 candidates, 
  his father was russian with dutch roots who fled from the russian revolution . 
  his mother is estonian .
