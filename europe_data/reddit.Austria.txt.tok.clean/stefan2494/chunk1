you 're joking , right ? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrxst6upira ) one is great too . 
  ( acapella ), 
  9.5 / 10 i 'd say . 
  i laughed way too hard at this, 
  a journalist from neuwal.com , a politics blog i 'm part of , also attended the ball and guessed between 800 and 1000 people : [ link ] ( http://neuwal.com/index.php/2014/01/26/nationalfreiheitlicher-akademikerball/ ) . 
  even if was less than 800 , the fp\u00d6 will surely continue the ball for the next few years as they are really profiting from the violent protesters . 
  austria : * the fp\u00d6 , which is the 3rd largest party in parliament , held their annual `` academics ball '' in the hofburg palace in vienna . 
  the hofburg was perhaps the most important building throughout the history of austria , and many austrians thought that the right-wing fp\u00d6 should not be allowed to hold their ball ( which is traditionally attended by the `` burschenschaften '' student fraternities , some of which are very right-wing ) there * the vienna police cordoned of a pretty big area around the hofburg for the evening , even journalists were not allowed in that area ( expect for half an hour , if accompanied by police ) * about 6000 people rallied against the ball ( which was attended by around 1000 people ) * around 300 of those protesters were left extremists that thrashed windows , ( police ) cars and a police station in the inner city of vienna . 
  * around 15 were arrested and some injured . 
  * because the media focussed on the 300 vandals rather than the 5700 peaceful protesters , the ball can be seen as a success for the fp\u00d6 who can now blame and attack all austrian leftists and accuse them of all sorts of things, 
  i do n't think it would have worked . 
  bismarck would have made sure prussia was independent sooner or later . 
  that 's what germans say, 
  austria does n't have such a legal agreement with the us , so there ca n't be any payments . 
  still , ever since the 17th century , the habsburgs -- even when they were emperors of the holy roman empire -- were concentrating more and more on their hereditary lands , thus gradually introducing the term `` austria '' both as geographical term and as a name for their dynasty ( `` casa austriaca '' ) . 
  mozart never considered himself to be austrian , he once said he was `` ein stolzer teutscher '' ( a proud german ) . 
  salzburg , where he was born and grew up , was not part of `` austria '' ( e.g. 
  ruled by the habsburgs ) at that time . 
  one positive thing to come out of this whole fp\u00d6 malarky : with \u00d6vp , sp\u00d6 , greens and neos , there 'll be a pro-european 2/3-majority in the new parliament . 
  at least german politicians know what `` resigning '' means -- unheard of in austria !, 
  well ... 
  yes , although in the age of twitter and facebook , it is constantly breached . 
  some people on twitter are dropping huge hints right now . 
  many polls actually close earlier ( some have already ) , it 's mostly big cities like vienna or innsbruck that close at 17:00 . 
  this means there 'll be a pretty accurate result at 17:00 . 
  if they do n't get a majority , sp\u00d6-\u00d6vp-greens certainly seems likely . 
  a right-wing coalition between \u00d6pv-fp\u00d6-stronach would be a bit unstable . 
  the neos , should they manage to enter parliament , have considered themselves as a possible coalition partner , either with \u00d6vp and sp\u00d6 or sp\u00d6 and greens . 
   i am irritated that our two largest parties , the social democrats ( left ) and moderaterna ( centric ) are so close , even though they are on opposite sides . 
  this is happening in a lot of countries , i think . 
  conservatives and social democrats are often the two largest parties , even though they are becoming increasingly more similar and closer to the centre ( or even to the right , some might say ) -- for example , \u00d6vp and sp\u00d6 in austria , labor and the tories in the uk and perhaps even cdu/csu and spd in germany . 
  it 's semi-elected , i 'd say -- whenever there 's a state election in one of austria 's 9 states , the composition of the bundesrat changes to reflect the new state parliament . 
   a bit `` corrupt '' it 's extremely corrupt !, 
  we 've only just started finding out some of the things that have been going on over the last years and there 've been a few trials and convictions . 
  corruption is one of the main attack points for the opposition . 
  it 's the easiest way for them , since all important jobs in the country ( e.g. 
  state owned companies and offices ) are divided up between members or people loyal to one of the two big parties . 
  yep , basically . 
  issues dominating the election campaign were taxes , jobs , and to a lesser extent the austrian education system . 
  frank stronach caused a stir when he said the death penalty ought to be reintroduced to austria for `` professional killers '' . 
  his party distanced themselves from this remark . 
  since the last election in 2008 , the sp\u00d6 and the \u00d6vp have formed a `` grand coalition '' ( as they are the largest parties ) . 
  this has happened most of the time since the second world war . 
  polls are predicting another ( perhaps close ) majority for chancellor werner faymann ( sp\u00d6 ) and michael spindelegger ( \u00d6vp ) , although this majority could be in danger if the neos manage to enter parliament ( there 's a nationwide 4 % threshold ) and the bz\u00d6 manages to stay in parliament . 
  the following parties are running : parties already in parliament : * ** sp\u00d6 ** : centre-left * ** \u00d6vp ** : centre-right * ** fp\u00d6 ** : far-right populist * ** bz\u00d6 ** : founded by former fp\u00d6 members as moderate right alternative , has tried to become a more liberal-centre platform * ** greens ** : environmentalist , left policies . 
  differences between the vienna group of the party ( more left ) and the greens in western austria ( more centre , bourgeoise ) * ** team stronach ** : founded by billionaire frank stronach , founder of magna , economically liberal , eurosceptical parties not in parliament , running nationwide : * ** neos ** : founded last year mostly by disgruntled \u00d6vp members , liberal * ** pirate party ** : focussing on data and privacy issues * ** kp\u00d6 ** : communist party , oldest party in austria, 
  funny how all the germans are celebrating when in fact austria has an even higher recycling rate . 
  copyrighted , huh ? 
  paprika is the german word for peppers ... 
  thanks for your comprehensive answer !, 
  i see . 
  does that also apply to parliamentary elections or are there different requirements in that case ? 
  what do you mean by `` 500 elected peoples '' ? 
  that 's pretty interesting !, 
  how many signatures does a party need to be allowed to run ? 
  interesting , that seems similar to austria . 
  we have around 900 parties registered , but  90 % are just one-man-parties or stuff like that , because it 's so easy to found a party ( simply send a document to the ministry of the interior ) . 
  one more thing : can the 5000 signatures be collected anywhere , or is it like here in austria , where you need 2600 overall , but a certain number from each state ( e.g. 
  thanks !, 
  are there other ways to run in an election ( for example as an independent candidate ) or does it have to be with a party ? 
  great , tak !, 
  are there other ways to run in an election ( for example as an independent candidate ) or does it have to be with a party ? 
  i mua holt decht dass i da uazige zillachtola do bi , oda ? 
  austria : * a politician from the green party said all turkish immigrants that support erdogan should leave austria * lots of greens and other people were angry at him * then a different green politician said that statement was wrong , but in the future , erdogan supporters should n't be granted austrian citizenship * even more people were angry * parties are preparing for the general election which is in 99 days * it 's hot !, 
  but not anymore . 
  that was probably our 1 week of summer . 
  because isis and other fighters target men much more . 
  it 's just in muslim culture , men are for fighting , that 's why they are in more immediate danger of being killed . 
  which is why i just created / r/refugeeswelcome /, 
  you 're really stupid , are n't you ? 
  for austria , it 's probably the university of vienna ( oldest and biggest in the country ) , but certain fields are more prestigious in other places , for example innsbruck university likes to stress its leading role in quantum science research . 
  i tried in another thread yesterday and came to the conclusion that you ca n't have a proper discussion with people who believe people dying in syria , afghanistan etc. 
  are none of our business . 
  thanks . 
  the amount of stupidity in the comments here is too high . 
   fears about the consequences yes that 's a nice way of saying `` racist '', 
  simple : i 'd rather give up 10 % ( or less ) of my wealth as a european citizen than see thousands of fellow humans die every day in africa and the middle east . 
  thank god there are at least a few sensible people around , like you and / u/munich _ man, 
  they do n't . 
  and obviously all refugees are uneducated fascist islamic terrorists who rape european children and kill police officers . 
   an allowance to cover your very , * very * basic need  free health care which everybody in europe gets  free language courses most of these are organised and run by volunteers  allowance for children to cover the very basic needs of your children  lack of responsibilities not true -- the tabloids start scream as soon as a refugee puts one toe over the line  more rights than the native inhabitants of the country bullshit , where did you get these claims from ? 
  are you saying north korea , iran , saudia arabia etc. 
  are better places than europe ? 
  yes , but does she * mean * it and will she * do * anything about it ? 
  i fear not , but we 'll see . 
   un or undereducated this is another lie . 
  europe has never before seen an influx of such highly educated refugees . 
  a very large proportion of them are either university students or judges , lawyers , politicians , teachers and similar . 
  it 's the educated ones that realise they have to flee , and the not-so-clever ones that stay and die there . 
  in austria -- which is the main country in this particular incident -- you can only request asylum personally at a police station or council office inside the country . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  ohhh , are you afraid they 'll take your toys away from you ? 
  i can take ignorant and bigot , but in what way am i being massively hypocritical ? 
  do enlighten me . 
  and which way would that be ? 
  i see your point , but there is ( and should be ) a difference between getting a visa and getting asylum . 
  that 's why i 'm suggesting we should divide them up equally . 
  essentially what you 're saying is `` we 're lucky that lots of these refugees are dying so we do n't have to share our wealth with them . '', 
  i think i 'm done talking with you .
