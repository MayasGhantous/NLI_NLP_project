that was exactly my point :p, 
  and the wages are low . 
  it does n't . 
  it reflects the mentality of putin and his friends trying to bring the soviet union back . 
  and what did they do with assad 's soldiers ? 
  give them flowers and chocolate ? 
  and how do we prove it ? 
  joining isis means they 're against everything we stand for ( women 's rights , gay rights , freedom of religion , etc. 
  ) , which makes them as dangerous as neo-nazis and right-wing extremists . 
  they made a decision . 
  if they want to come back , sure . 
  but they will be punished accordingly . 
  every criminal says they regret it , or that they 're innocent , in order to gain sympathy and/or face a lighter sentence . 
  those guys are no exception . 
  they still have strong ties with other emerging countries . 
  also a good portion of the eu/us clothing comes from places like china and bangladesh . 
  [ they 'll just start using off-brandheelz . com ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k92vsil57y ), 
  except that snowden did n't kill/torture/rape anyone . 
  theoretically , yes . 
  we only have the ones coming from romania/bulgaria to beg during the summer . 
  when it gets cold , they kind of disappear . 
  funny thing is that even their posters have the same handwriting/typos . 
  mannerisms can still show a lot . 
  most of the brazilian roma are fully integrated , speak native portuguese , have normal jobs/education and do n't even remember they 're gypsies . 
  i do n't know how it happened , but it did . 
  it 's really weird to have a bazillion serbs and not a single restaurant ( that i 've heard of ), 
  then i 'd start supporting the russian government and buy putin t-shirts . 
  wtf ? 
  good thing they 're starting to lose popularity ( again ), 
  he 's changing the mentality of the russian population , though . 
  they were slowly , but steadily improving when it comes to gay rights , for example . 
  now being gay in russia means you 're literally hitler . 
  language barrier , mostly . 
  or they already have contacts inside the uk . 
  `` exporting '', 
  tell that to the contracts omv * just signed * with gazprom . 
  mixing it with everything is the best way to go . 
  c2 german , english and portuguese . 
  b2 spanish , basic french, 
  china 's luxury market is massive , though . 
  we got used to it . 
  yup . 
  and 75 euro/semester for students . 
  the other 4 are performed by nigerian princes . 
  that 's pretty accurate . 
  nope . 
  those are just rumors . 
  the `` nuclear arms race '' between brazil and argentina ended with the cold war . 
  despite its ties with russia and iran , venezuela is too unstable to achieve anything at the moment , and col ** o ** mbia is too closely tied to the u.s. to even risk doing that . 
  brazil has the technology ( and more than enough uranium ) to produce nuclear weapons , though , but their constitution and foreign policy heavily discourage that . 
  brazil and argentina ? 
  am i reading this right ? 
  that 's more than enough for me to dislike him . 
  it 's funny because we think schwechater is horrible . 
  with czech beer , you can conquer pretty much anyone you want . 
  you can buy a decent 1br apartment at 6th district ( pretty much the best place ever ) for less than 40k . 
  they generally just go for stolen passports from people who look slightly like the buyers . 
  some pass through and try to go to germany , but the majority stays . 
  well , they 're pretty much against everything russia does , but not as openly as die presse . 
  they just care more deeply about other issues ( like asylum seekers , the mariahilferstra\u00dfe or veggie burgers ) the comments section is generally ok if you pay attention to the upvotes/downvotes . 
  it 's easy to spot who the loonies are . 
  der standard is not pro-russian at all o.o, 
  they have the black boxes , 
  not knowing where to put his yacht, 
  certain developing countries . 
  but that 's due to the formation of a previously nonexistent middle class . 
  [ statistically speaking , the streets are safer than in 2014 . 
  ] ( http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/bk/publikationen/krim_statistik/start.aspx ) the subjective feeling got a lot worse , though . 
  the sub is supposed to get hold of the government , not the other way around :p, 
   it need hardly be added that france is in a different league from the united states , which up till now has taken in fewer than 1,000 syrian refugees , and whose republican candidates for president have vied to prove to voters the depth of their antipathy to muslim migrants . 
  they admitted that as well . 
  if we analyse it in a political way , it was . 
  they were already coming by the thousands last year , and the political landscape in europe was n't nearly as skeptical as it is today . 
  instead of trying to find real solutions , they tried to justify the problem . 
  a unified eu solution is still far away from happening - that 's why individual countries had to act instead of waiting for the whole system to collapse . 
  so yeah , it was inevitable because the eu : 1 . 
  was n't competent enough to handle it . 
  had no popular opinion supporting a tougher stance . 
  it should , and it does . 
  but they 're not going to let that go for free , when they can make the whole thing profitable . 
  exactly . 
  the refugee crisis was inevitable - they were just trying to find an excuse to justify it . 
  because they know they have leverage . 
  austrian is pretty much what you 'd expect from lufthansa , with an austrian accent and classical music playing when you board the plane . 
  the older planes are pretty noisy ( although they 're planning to replace them ), 
   this section is based on surveys from visitors of this website . 
  questions for this surveys are similar to many similar scientific and government surveys . 
  nothing to see here . 
  plus they bring money from abroad and have a high chance of staying in the country - at the end of the day , it 's one of the best forms of skilled migration . 
  proportionally , austria has [ more ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_immigrant_population ) immigrants than france . 
  the difference between austria and france is that our migrants are mostly from germany , turkey and eastern europe , instead of northern africa . 
  vienna 's population is 25 % foreign-born . 
  almost 40 % have an immigration background . 
  certain groups are fully integrated ( e.g. 
  bosnians , iranians ) , others not ( some turks , for example , live in a parallel society . 
  others identify more as being austrian than turkish ) . 
  the fact that vienna has a large number of immigrants ** from different countries and cultures ** helps a lot when it comes to integration . 
  a large number of people from a single culture without the willingness or need to integrate is the perfect recipe for segregation and ghettos . 
  claiming to be a refugee does n't mean you are one . 
  the 2nd is a pretty diverse and open-minded district , especially now with the new universities .
