oh i get , you are wondering because the cdu is merkels ' party . 
  well , you could also support the cdu on a regional base or be a supporter of the csu ( which is only active in bavaria ) and do n't be a fan of merkel at the same time . 
  3 % is not that much tbh . 
  so basically soviet russia . 
  just out of interest : what countries for example ? 
  what 's the problem ? 
   the turncoat thing bavaria was so good at back then as a tyrolean , i totally agree . 
  they do not live totally segregated , but partially . 
  obviously people with the same / similar cultural backgrounds and social classe usually stay together . 
  but that 's apparent in all cities around the world . 
  however , i must add that in average croats are less nationalist and show less hate on austria than their serbian counterparts . 
  these are just my experiences from the yugos i met in my area ( they declare themselves as yugos ) . 
  it 's funny , i see croatians and serbians have a big hate-love relationship going on . 
  however , many often show nostalgia and wish back the good ole ' times of yugoslavia even though they were born and raised in austria :'d, 
   make only a tiny fraction if local population . 
  are you sure about that ? 
  it happened that nowadays they often live in ethnic quarters of a city . 
  just look at vienna : 50 % to 60 % of the population derive from immigrants . 
  it 's not the only newspaper that admits that the perpetrators were n't of german origin and that the 21 year old was indeed serbian . 
  others : welt.de , zeit.de , . . 
   but third generation ; whatever their faults are , it 's fully the blame of the host country , it 's society and education . 
  woah , that 's harsh . 
  i would n't fully blame austria . 
  what if the second generation brought up the third generation like this ? 
  but in all honesty : i do n't know many third generation yugos . 
  most croats and serbs i met were indeed second generation . 
  a few were third generation , and in my eyes they were a little more open minded than the ones whose parents were first gen immigrants .

  i see , well i 'm talking mostly about my second and third generation acquaintances . 
  indeed , the majority of them are from villages and smalltowns . 
  frankly i 'm from a rural region myself , though our rural regions seem not to be as conservative as the ones in croatia/serbia . 
  ohh , that 's a classic , just like many of the cool boys over here were always the ones that cried the most about krampus . 
  i 'm from austria and most of the serbian/croatian immigrants i met thus far ( which are a lot tbh ) wer extreme patriots or nationalist lol . 
  most male yugos over here look like - or at least try to - look like a copy of cristiano ronaldo , whereas most female yugos would try to look like a kardashian ^ ^ what are your experiences with croats living in austria/germany/switzerland ? 
  wow , this is hilarious . 
  nevertheless , pity for the scared children and their ruined skiing week . 
  i wonder how none of them had suffered a stroke . 
  well , you 'll probably hate me for this , but the only croatian phrase they yugos over here taught my ( and use all the time lol ) is `` u picku materinu '' sorry for this my friend ^ ^, 
  right in the feels man ... 
  fuck the beatings and whippings !, 
  he fricking stole your chestnuts !, 
  i 'd never forgive him . 
  if you put it that way , i 'm in . 
  thx . 
  trust me , it is . 
  man i wish your kids knew their former tradition as well ^ ^ not everything you wish for should be shoved up your ass , as it is nowadays haha, 
  that 's what i assumed too , but compared to eg . 
  serbs it 's a rather small part of the austrian population, 
  ok thanks , i love the cultural diversity of europe !, 
  ok thank you , europe is incredibly rich in culture . 
  someone else already showed me this guys ' website . 
  really awesome , i 'm fond of all of these paganic traditions !, 
  btw . 
  are tradtions like your caretos common all over portugal or just in the north ? 
  are they common all over portugal ? 
  oh , we have similar groups like these silvesterkl\u00e4use in some parts of austria too , though not as spread . 
  well , i think all of them derive from the same or similar winter rituals . 
  you know over the centuries the dates of the rituals often shifted in the different areas . 
  ok , this is what i assumed . 
  i wish there would be a festival once somewhere with one group of each different prechristian tradition and costumes . 
  problem is that even the krampus costumes and tradtition are often different from village to village . 
  lol , reminds my of my dads ' favourite mechanic , who is croatian too . 
  i can see , you are the only country in the balkans actually doing well . 
  i also do n't know any slovenian immigrants where i live in austria . 
  mostly serbs , croats and some bosnians ( and lots of turks , but well , that 's another story ) . 
  so would they flog people with birches or sticks to ? 
  nonetheless , i can see the similarities . 
  wait , what about the masked monsters that arrived at 08:40 ? 
  they look like a straight copy of our krampusse / perchten . 
  yep , seems like it derives pretty much from the same tradition . 
  the only other similar tradition i could think of are `` tsch\u00e4g\u00e4tta '' , as u/kyffhaeuser already introduced me to them . 
  communism in yugoslavia must have really sucked for you , being ruled mostly by serbs . 
  you 're quite right , they were n't punished as hard as germans , for whatever reason . 
  ok , but do n't forget that there were lots of german speaking people too in some slovernian regions . 
  are you kind of anti-austrian ? 
  because all the slovenians i met on reddit are really fond of austria . 
  yes i just read about it on wikipedia , have n't heard about it before . 
  also the german exclave in the south of slovenia is quite interesting . 
  i 'm happy halloween did not settle down here . 
  there are some parties here and there , but not the real halloween as in american movies . 
  at least in a rather rural area . 
  i have no clue what it is in cities like vienna or graz . 
  well , it probably was . 
  yes it may have been stronger in slovenia , but magyarization was overall more strict and stronger in their parts . 
  but nvm , i 'm no expert on austria-hungary . 
  i do n't even like this era too much . 
  we were just a bunch of different cultures , languages and countries , predeterminated to fall . 
  tell me more about slovenia during the dual monarchy please . 
  nice , never heard about them . 
  this tradition surely is funny and scary at the same time too . 
  although i assume krampus are a lot more frightening , are n't they ? 
  probably depends on where you live . 
  i barely have anything to do with slovenians . 
  i live just next to the border to germany , also not that far from switzerland and southern tyrol . 
  but mostly regarding the fact how different german speaking regions themselves are , i never even thought about slovenia . 
  but i 've seen a lot of pictures of your villages , people and traditions and indeed - we are very similar . 
  oh sorry , apparently you know better . 
  i 'm not denying that there might have been germanization in slovenia once , however , eg . 
  magyarization was way stronger in austria-hungary . 
  but yeah the system was far from perfect .
