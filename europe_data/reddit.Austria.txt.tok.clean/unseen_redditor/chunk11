  yeah if it 's deep-fried it 's probably our own invention . 
  and most of all sweet paprika powder, 
  ha , austria has been pretty successful stealing recipes from other countries and selling them as our own . 
  oh you guys and your puny white bread . 
  have some [ schwarzbrot with grammelschmalz ] ( http://www.daskochrezept.de/_img_upload/media/rezept/prev/94447/mid_4bb0c5fcac5b3.jpg ) ... or with bacon , or ... brb , hungry, 
  here 's a map of rainfall in litres per m ^ 2 in some austrian cities from thursday morning last week until monday morning ( so today ) : [ map ] ( http://images.derstandard.at/t/13/livebericht/1369362384017/53128543-6262-4956-a237-02001b6b769b.jpg ) so for example for the city of salzburg , that 's the average amount of rainfall of may and june combined . 
  oh it 's got something to do with the alijew case about the ( former ) ambassador of kazakhstan in austria who faced charges of murder and treason ( or planing a coup d'etat ) back home . 
  an austrian court rejected a plea from kazakhstan to extradite him though . 
  anyways , gusenbauer is suspected of having delivered confidential documents about the case to kazakhstan or something like that . 
  the whole story is a bit bizarre . 
  * continuous rain over the whole week with floodings an mudslides incoming . 
  one person already dead . 
  * the leader of the far-right , xenophobic fp\u00d6 told the public that his party has never ever ever made an anti-foreigner election campaign . 
  on a related noted , he thinks he spreads love . 
  * if european countries begin to sell arms to syria or any group operating there , we will probably withdraw our un-troops from the israeli-syrian border . 
  * a magazine published a story according to which former chancellor alfred gusenbauer is a spy for kazachstan . 
  * the rainfall did n't even refrain from jeopardising the holding of main [ cultural events ] ( http://images02.kurier.at/46-55760467.jpg/940x540nocrop2/14.269.226 ), 
  wow , i 've never heard of these games before , but it 's so cute !, 
  this map is partly based on a scientific approach and partly on surveys . 
  that 's why hungary . 
  edit : i feel weird for knowing this . 
  somehow this makes me feel uncomfortable . 
  yes , a large chunk of the earnings go to his foundation . 
  the woman next to him is barbara eden, 
  well , that sure was an educated answer . 
  the only negative thing about new zealand that comes to mind is : why are you so far away from us ? 
  yeah the shock saved him , it 's incredible though how long it lasted . 
  when i was in paris , virtually everybody refused to talk in french with me . 
  for example at a restaurant i ordered in french , the waitress replied in english , i responded in french and she answered in english yet again . 
  it was so unnerving . 
  bloody french ... * mumble *, 
  last week i had an interesting conversation with a drunken french guy : him : `` do you speak english ? '', 
  me : `` yes ... '' him : `` me too . 
  i 'm french and i speak english !!! '', 
  he was so excited . 
  unfortunately yes . 
  it 's a miracle medical staff even managed to reattach it in the first place , let alone how this badass guy drove 20km to the next hospital without becoming unconscious/losing too much blood . 
  austria : * top story of the week : the fire brigade had to rescue two beavers out of a ` biotope ' near the nuclear power station zwentendorf ( which was never put into operation ) . 
  so they built a ladder , but the beavers ate it . 
  in a second attempt the beavers finally used the ladder to get back into the danube . 
  * 2 weeks ago a hungarian worker lost his right arm in a work accident . 
  so he fetched his cut-off arm , went to his car , drove some 20km to the next hospital , where , at the emergency entrance , he told the doorman that he had an accident and his arm is wounded . 
  the doorman now did n't see what really happened and told him to drive to the general entrance . 
  there he got himself a parking ticket , went into the hospital , showed them his arm and told them to please sew it on again . 
  in a 6-hour long operation they managed to reattach it . 
  unfortunately he got an infection this week and they had to take his arm off again .

  europe 's biggest charity event helping people with aids . 
  * the province of tyrol is now governed by a coalition of conservative \u00d6vp and the greens . 
  thanks !, 
  vienna is the head of austria , sorry bundesl\u00e4nder , 
  this is actually a repost from 6 months ago , but i only learned about it now and i think it 's something more people should know about . 
  it just seemed odd to me that the netherlands has a lower pp than the neighboring regions . 
  wow , that 's awful . 
  should n't the netherlands be much more orange-redish ? 
  there there , have some chocolate . 
  yay greece !, 
  i. . that ... what ? 
  that grin, 
  for me it 's `` stream access denied . '', 
  weird, 
  but even then i do n't know what unhealthy stuff justifying this legislation somehow would come into the carafe , randomly or by other guests . 
  i would be more worried about kitchen standards to be honest . 
  and if there really is a problem , what about vinegar ? 
  or salt , pepper , sugar ? 
  i guess we just need more information on that . 
  i do n't get the purpose of the directive ? 
  say , if there 's already olive oil in my salad , i do n't know where it comes from either . 
  well this lovely lady certainly was n't one of those musicians , 
  switzerland ca n't vote , they have to stay neutral , 
  bulgaria ... my ears !, 
  oh god !, 
  that 's one happy little austria, 
  as a eu3 player this gives me the chills . 
  given ascension day has no fixed date there is really no need to replace it with europe day . 
  just make it another public holiday and everyone will be happy . 
  well in austria , coincidentally , we do have a holiday today , though for another reason , it 's ascension day . 
  i would fully support making europe day an official holiday though . 
  what all oft / r/europe thought, 
  oh , that 's kind of sad ... 
  the one and only, 
  very welcoming people , beautiful capital and party all over the place ... or at least that 's what i gathered from my two weeks stay some years ago  e : oh and they got fairly cool [ buses ] ( http://www.philseed.com/images/malta-buses-pcard2.jpg ), 
  also , our minister for agricultural and environmental affairs is heavily attacked for his decision not only to vote against a ban of neonicotinoids , but also to reject access to information how many tons of them are used in austria per year , arguing it 's a state secret . 
  today ( edit : yesterday ) the dean of the faculty of law of vienna mentioned that that 's abuse of authority and therefore illegal . 
  edit : first salzburg election projections : ** sp\u00d6 ** ( socialdem ) : 24,1 % ( - 15,3 % ) ** \u00d6vp ** ( cons ) : 30,5 % ( - 6,0 % ) ** fp\u00d6 ** ( right ) : 16,3 % ( + 3,3 % ) ** greens ** : 20,0 % ( + 12,6 % ) ** stronach ** : 7,8 % ( new ), 
  wait , what ? 
  never heard of that, 
  the viennese are said to be a bit morbid . 
  some days ago i was sitting in the attic of our seven story university faculty building , learning . 
  you have to know the attic is slightly higher than the surrounding buildings , resulting in a cool view over vienna . 
  eventually the concierge passed by to get the elevator downstairs and while waiting she looked out of the windows and , out of the blue , told me : ` what a wonderful view ... 
  it 's a miracle nobody ever jumped off this building yet . ', 
  swedish . . oh well , there 's a swedish minority in southern finland after all . 
  in austria street view was temporarily stopped because of data protection issues , but that was back in 2010 or 2011 i think . 
  well afaik the prince of liechtenstein does in fact wield some power . 
  it 's pure comedy . 
  also , you have to know stronach spent most of his life in canada ( and even now he stays in canada most of the year in order to evade austrian taxation ) , so his german is a bit rusty to say the least and he 's got a slightly odd accent . 
  from the latest interview : ** anchorman ** ( citing the party program ) : you want to reduce administrative costs by 5 % each year . 
  how many billions would that be ? 
  ** stronach ** : that 's many billions .
