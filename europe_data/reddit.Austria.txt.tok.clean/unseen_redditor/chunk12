  ** anchorman ** : yes , how many ? 
  ** stronach ** : we 'll have to calculate that . 
  yes . 
  i know , it 's going to be more than a billion . 
  and we know as well that the whole thing does n't work anymore . 
  for example , our example is : * ( blablabla , do n't want to translate all of that ) * ** anchorman ** : but , mr. stronach , that 's got nothing to do with my question ... ** stronach ** : we have to ... 
  the people want to understand ... we say , that 's a question of economy . 
  and i think i know the economy . 
  ** anchorman ** : mr stronach . 
  ** stronach ** : and i also know , you are a good reporter , but you do n't know the economy . 
  ** anchorman ** : mr stronach . 
  ** stronach ** : i 'd be happy to give you private lessons in economy . 
  ** anchorman ** : okay . 
  i studied economy a bit . 
  anyway . 
  ** stronach ** : a bit , that 's ... that 's not enough . 
  ** anchorman ** : despite that . 
  if you write so precisely in your party program that you are able to reduce administrative costs by 5 % , you have to know how much those 5 % are . 
  ** stronach ** : yes , we know , how much the administrative costs are . 
  on the whole , 5 % . 
  one can calculate that . 
  what 's important : we have to reduce the administrative costs . 
  we all know , it is over-administered . 
  if you want to begin a bootmaking in austria , a barbershop , you have to do many exams . 
  take care , if the shoes do n't fit , nobody will buy them . 
  that 's got nothing to do with ecology . 
  we need ... we have to stimulate the economy . 
  * ( ... ) * ** anchorman ** : mr. stronach . 
  do you know the writer mark twain ? 
  ** stronach ** : yes , certainly . 
  i heard much about him . 
  ** anchorman ** : mark twain wrote : an interview typically consists of the interviewer who asks the questions , and the interviewee who answers them . 
  your answers got nothing to do with my questions . 
  i 'd like to know one more time : how much of the austrian administrative costs are you able to cut . 
  ** stronach ** : you 've got a problem : you always want yes or no . 
  i could say as well ... ** anchorman ** : no , i do n't have to yes or no . 
  ** stronach ** : tell me , yes or no : is orf ( austrian public broadcasting ) lead well in economic terms ? 
  ** anchorman ** : mr stronach . 
  ** stronach ** : tell me yes or no . 
  ** anchorman ** : mr stronach , an interview consists of an interviewer who asks the questions . 
  that 's me . 
  ** stronach ** : you are a state employee . 
  ** anchorman ** : no , i 'm not a state employee . 
  ** stronach ** : you are at orf . 
  then it 's a hidden employment . 
  ** anchorman ** : mr stronach . 
  ** stronach ** : you ca n't tell me that this is a private company . 
  that 's ... that 's not true what you say now . 
  ** anchorman ** : mr stronach , i 'm not a state employee . 
  ** stronach ** : you are ... you work ... do you know what 's corruption ? 
  ** anchorman ** : ... ** stronach ** : corruption is too , people , who consciously support corruption , structures and values . 
  and i think , with the heart and the thinking he agrees with me . 
  but you know , if you do n't act after the parties , you do n't have this position . 
  because this association ... * ( does n't make sense in german either ) * ** anchorman ** : mr stronach ... ** stronach ** : and orf will only function from politics ... * it goes on like that . 
  one might think so , but it 's not . 
  if it was though , i would award the whole project an award for the most elaborate joke in the history of the universe . 
  i 'm not trying to brush off the impact communism had , and , as i said , during the time of the iron curtain the division sure made some sense ( or as my parents put it : the world ended on the eastern border ) . 
  but even with all the marks communism left and time needed to overcome them , from a historical point of view , some decades of communism seem insignificant compared to centuries of exchange . 
  and to me , the future seems bright in that respect or at least that 's what i 'm hoping . 
  i do n't feel western but central european and i do think i have reasons for that ; historical , cultural , geographical . 
  if that 's childish to you , oh well . 
  i know and i do n't really care about that anyway , but i do understand embiceks feelings . 
  i do feel austria is close to czech republic and actually has been for centuries , so why say cze is eastern and aut is western . 
  does n't really make sense to me . 
  torn down more than 20 years ago . 
  sure , the division made sense during the east-west split after wwii , but that 's the past . 
  and not a very long one , for that matter . 
  but it does n't make sense to make a division like that because of merely some decades of communism and an iron curtain . 
  the former is nothing compared to centuries of exchange before that and the iron curtain is gone physically and , by now , i do hope mentally too . 
  it 's strange though to say austria is western european , whereas e.g. 
  czech republic or slovenia are eastern european , even more so considering both prague and ljubiljana are to the west of vienna . 
  and let 's not forget long lasting historical and cultural ties . 
  at least austria , czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia are central european to me . 
  so your message is that austria is a xenophobic country and austrians are either nazis or collaborating with them , did i get that right ? 
  impressive . 
  now that 's some career ... 
  you mean the filipinos who got kidnapped ? 
  all of them were released if i remember correctly . 
  if you wanted to get through to me , you 've got my attention . 
  but where is your message ? 
  so far , you 've just insulted me . 
  oh right , i mixed that up somehow . 
  then why did you write ` austrians are nazis ' if that 's not what you wanted to say ? 
  why did you imply in that other thread about authors that austrians are scum ? 
  telling me i 'm a nazi is ` bantering ' to you ?? 
  the fuck is wrong with you ? 
  es hat das zweimal in einem krieg geendet '' ` besides , we currently build up enormous concepts of enemies in europe , against the banks and the rich , the wealthy . 
  we already had something like that once , back then embellished against the jews , but people thought of similar groups . 
  it led to war two times . ', 
  oh man , you really hate austrians , do you ? 
  he 's quite fun , his interviews in public broadcasting are highly amusing . 
  oh and even now he stays in canada most of the year to avoid full taxation in austria . 
  i heard he tried to enter canadian politics once but failed miserably ? 
  nothing much * battle over banking secrecy with the social democrats being vaguely supportive of the demands of eu and the conservatives fiercely against . 
  side note : next elections coming up in autumn . 
  * our weekly edition of stronach 's folly ( or : that rich austro-canadian guy who wants to get into government ) . 
  * is it safe at golan heights ? 
  probably not . 
  should our troops stay ? 
  for the time being , yes .
