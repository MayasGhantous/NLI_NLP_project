  if anything , the whole anthem is crappy . 
  the first part is boring , the second part is historically questionable and the third part is pathetic ( funny how everybody discusses about t\u00f6chter und s\u00f6hne , but `` frei und gl\u00e4ubig '' is totally okay ) . 
  i vow to thee would easily win in the category most majestic anthem . 
  love it . 
  the text on the other hand ... well , a product of its time . 
  only in your wet dreams . 
  huh , never thought of it as `` religious '' . 
  i always really liked the text , especially the second part . 
  it fits so well . 
  here , we will take them . 
  place one in lake neusiedl and the other one in lake constance . 
  that would be a sight to behold . 
   firstly i think it is an internal russian issue . 
  then russia should n't have signed the treaty to become a member of the permanent arbitration court in den hague . 
   amazing how people are happy to champion the cause of oligarchs , just as long as it sticks it to putin . 
  i champion a court ruling over your arguments of morality , because other than you , a court tends to be impartial , even if it 's an arbitration court . 
  oh and by the way , are you aware of the fact that in arbitration both sides can choose an equal number of judges ? 
  fun thing , the ruling was unanimous . 
   unfortunately i do not have a creditable threat of violence to back up my rulings as opposed to an international arbitration court ? 
  well , [ apparently ] ( http://www.megamonalisa.com/artworks/megamonalisa_vatican-girl.jpg ) ( nsfw ) . 
  i do n't even ... 
  op probably should have searched for '' [ country ] girl ** s ** '' for more ` accurate ' results . 
  / e : well , turns out nope , same result still . 
  google does n't seem to make a difference between `` girls '' and `` girl 's ( body ) '', 
  i know us americans generally have a weirdly absolutist view of freedom of speech , but it is just a fundamental right , a right which - as any right - can be restricted . 
  restricting something is not the same as taking it away completely , otherwise there would be no freedom of expression in all of europe as well as the us . 
  sanctions within the cfsp framework are decided on by the council , i.e. 
  the ep does not have a say in this process ( the ec and the high representative do though ) . 
  i think it depends on the type of sanction whether unanimity has to be reached or qualified majority is enough ( keep in mind though , that the council will always strive for unanimity ) . 
  so it 's not the pms who decide , it 's the council , which in this formation will consist of the ministers of foreign affairs . 
  well but that 's about holocaust denial , stemming from the view that , since the holocaust is n't just one of the worst crimes in the history of mankind but also an established fact , denial therefore can not be and should not be possible . 
  i 'm rather curious about the `` false information about soviet activities '' part though . 
  seems a bit vague and i have a feeling it 's not about false information about soviet wrong-doings but rather the other way round . 
   by matthew day , warsaw  4:56 pm bst 13 jun 2014 also , it 's fairly certain that a nato exercise caused this . 
  looks very much like the position of the government . 
  i 'm not sure about the accuracy of the map though . 
  all countries have economic interests , therefore it 's always a question of * what * the sanctions would cover . 
  shall we form an alpine confederation ? 
  i was always in support of splitting up austria into an outrageous number of cantons . 
  austria can not into mediterranean :(, 
  first sentence of the linked article :  five days after malaysia airlines flight mh17 was shot down over eastern ukraine thursday , ** the u.s. government released a map of the flight 's path and the site from which the missile was fired ** . 
  edit : also here the us says they know where the missile was fired from , just not who exactly launched it : http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2014/07/22/tsr-dnt-starr-evidence-of-missile-mh17.cnn.html, 
  i do n't want to destroy your world , but the eu - despite not being a country - is even represented in a number of international organisations as for example the un and the wto , and also other formations like the g8 . 
  my point was merely that while it may have been stupid , it was n't forbidden - in other words : who ever shot the plane wo n't be able to claim that there should n't have been any civilian aircraft in the area . 
   it gets even stupider , the ukrainian army closed the airspace over that area [ 3 ] , due to military operations . 
  not entirely true , they closed the airspace for flights * under * 7km ( or 8km , not sure now ) altitude . 
  so while malaysian probably still should n't have decided to fly over the war zone , it was n't forbidden either . 
  and in order to make the games a bit more exciting , the loser of the final game is going to be invaded . 
  now that would be some high drama . 
  this is what you get from joining the eu . 
  thanks , cameron . 
  the german team absolutely deserved it . 
  in erasmus you 're an exchange student at a partner university in another country for one or two semesters . 
  you 're studying and living there for that time . 
  so you definitely participated in something different . 
  i call for a joint invasion of liechtenstein for not linking to anyone . 
  let 's beat some sense of friendly neighbourship into them . 
  nah , do n't think so . 
  austria has another shade of red and in the latvian flag the white stripe is a bit smaller than the red ones , which seems to be the case in the picture . 
  it does n't make sense either way . 
  probably need some more context . 
  i still do n't understand the rat . 
  the colour and the width of the white stripe suggest latvia , but what 's the connection ? 
  i tend to agree that voting rights should also emanate from residence for people move around a lot more than in former times . 
  most eu states allow voting for eu citizens with residence in that state on a communal level , some even on regional level . 
  it 's also allowed for elections to the eu parliament if i 'm not wrong . 
  personally i would support voting rights for national elections based on residence , at least for eu citizens as a first step . 
  excuse me , i will have to polish my vocabulary . 
  this is about gdp/capita in pps . 
  i found the following data on [ eurostat ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/maptoolclosed.do?tab=map&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tgs00005&amp;toolbox=types ) , dating from 2011 : * vienna : 41.300 ( in 2000 : 34.600 ) * prague : 42.900 ( in 2000 : 26.400 ) * bratislava ( including region ) : 46.600 ( in 2000 : 20.700 ) warsaw and budapest do n't form a nuts2 region , so i do n't know . 
  fun fact , inner london has a gdp/capita/pps of 80.400 . 
  few inhabitants , lots of banks . 
  there 's also data on [ disposable income ] ( http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/maptoolclosed.do?tab=map&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tgs00026&amp;toolbox=types ) of private households in pps : * vienna : 19.800 * prague : 13.500 * bratislava : 16.000 * ( inner london : 23.500 ), 
  oh and do n't forget all the loot and treasure . 
  i thought it 's an almost comical remark , seeing how kara mustafa not only failed and lost his head for it , but in that his failure also brought an end to ottoman ambitions in central europe . 
  on the other hand i doubt erdogan - or the person who writes his speeches - is oblivious of this , so i might just not see the real picture here . 
  edit : it 's even funnier if you remember that the right-extreme in vienna some time ago issued a comic about the siege of vienna , transporting it ( in a pretty skewed way ) into present day to be used as election campaign material . 
  these people might like each other for their way of thinking seems to be not so unsimilar . 
  being allowed to vote is a pretty basic right of citizenship imo and living abroad does n't necessarily mean that your perception of your home country is skewed or that you 're not interested in the direction your home country is moving to anymore . 
   i wonder , how austria reach higher than some northern and western countries why is that so surprising ? 
  also , aut , nl , swe , irl , dk and ger are more or less on the same level anyway . 
  you know somebody has no arguments , if he has to refer to an event 500 years ago to make his point . 
  according to greenpeace , about 4 % of austria 's energy needs came from nuclear energy in 2012 - according to wikipedia even less . 
  if i 'm not wrong the goal of the government is to phase that out entirely . 
  edit : talking about electricity of course , not energy as such, 
  do n't take him so seriously , 
  seen it on tv , some old people still think so . 
  i 'm sure the latter is more common , sadly ( also for austria ) . 
  i guess it 's seen in a neutral , but somewhat positive light and of course every now and then romanticism kicks in . 
  actually i 'm not really sure what to discuss about it , apart from in history class . 
   `` would have not happened under the kaiser ... '' not really common thing to say . 
  maybe some confused old people do . 
  oh my , i 've never seen this before . 
  awesome !, 
  :d personally i would have thought of [ dj \u00d6tzi ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw8u-ixb_wi ), 
  do n't you dare speak out against falco . 
  lost lombardy and venetia , lost in the question of german unification , had to institute the dual monarchy , could not defy the warmongering party in the treatment of serbia , leading ultimately to wwi ... 
  he did manage though to hold the austrian monarchy together ( to no avail ) . 
  and he was married to * sisi * of course . 
  could have been a very decent monarch , if he had been more skilled in actually being a monarch .
