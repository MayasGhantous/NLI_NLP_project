  their acting seems rather pathetic to me . 
  edit : to make it more clear , according to the austrian pm the council also discussed blocking the ep . 
  he really just said that the council should adhere to the ep 's candidate as this is what was said before the election . 
  also :  faymann ( austrian chancellor ) is in favour of outvoting the critics : `` a grouser can not be allowed to be stronger than the majority . '', 
  ( derstandard.at ) we all know whom this is directed against . 
  i do n't like our chancellor much , but he 's right there . 
  we also use d'hondt in austria . 
  every party has a list of candidates ; you vote for the party and , if you want to , also for one of the party 's candidates . 
  if a candidate gets enough votes , he advances in the list to a better place . 
  but interesting to know how the finnish system works . 
  i 've wondered for some time why you always have those numbers on election posters . 
  woah , easy there gandhi . 
  oh and let 's not forget the oh-so-democratic house of lords . 
  yes , that unfortunately is or might be a consequence of having one single election . 
  you can bypass that to some extent by introducing a second , federal chamber with a certain amount of seats for each country ( be it relative to population size , be it the same amount for every country like in the us senate ) . 
  that of course would question the existence of the council - which is the point where a discussion reaches a fairly theoretical point if you 're not trying to look too far into a possible future , 
  so basically kind of like in belgium , if i get that right ? 
  might work , but i guess there is a more basic problem in countries like poland , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia and hungary . 
  while voter turnout in most countries is not really impressive , in those countries it 's devastatingly low . 
  i really wonder why . 
  that 's a fair remark , at the same time i still do n't think your proposal is a good solution , since i do think that it would only result in a lower overall turnout , which would therefore reverse the actual goal of increasing turnout . 
  i guess the only real solution to this problem ( edit : i mean the one of your reply ) ( merely a result of the eu not being a state ) is the introduction of * one * election , not 28 elections - but that 's probably a long way to go . 
  because ( a ) i ca n't influence how many more of my fellow countrymen go to give their vote and also ( b ) how should that convince non-voters to go to the ballot boxes ? 
  if i happened to live in a country with low turnout , why should my vote be worth less ? 
  that would n't exactly make me want to vote . 
  furthermore , who gets the empty seats ? 
  that 's basically punishing the people who turn up voting . 
  voting ended 17:00 cest . 
  latest projection : * \u00d6vp ( in epp ) : 27,5 % ( -2,4 % ) - 5 meps * sp\u00d6 ( in s&d ) : 23,8 % ( +0,1 % ) - 5 meps * fp\u00d6 ( no alliance ) : 19,5 % ( +6,8 % ) - 4 meps * greens ( greens/efa ) : 15,0 % ( +5,1 % ) - 3 meps * neos ( alde ) : 7,9 % ( new ) - 1 mep * other parties under the threshold : 6,8 % turnout : 45,6 % ( 46 % last election ) fluctuation range : + / - 0,5 % side note : despite the ( predictable ) success of fp\u00d6 , this means a clear pro-european majority . 
  adding to that , he never accuses the protesters of saying that . 
  he said `` people * like * these back there '' . 
  the basic idea of the peace treaties also was to draw borders along ethnic groups and even though the allied states largely failed at doing that , also out of their own interests ( see south tyrol ) , burgenland in my opinion serves as an example of going through with this principle ( even maybe if only simply for the fact that it was merely contested between war losers ) - even though hungary clearly was n't so happy about this decision and managed to keep sopron / \u00d6denburg in the end . 
  of course there was german speaking population scattered in different parts of the former monarchy , e.g. 
  in budapest , but the difference is that burgenland actually bordered `` austria '' and had a german speaking majority despite hungary 's [ magyarization policy after 1867 ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:magyars_%28hungarians%29_in_hungary,_census_1890.jpg ) ( apart from the fact that budapest always was the capital of hungary anyway ) . 
  more specifically , the finnish word means water-beak-animal and the dutch is bird-beak-animal . 
  wwi is almost a hundred years ago !, 
  and in any case austria ( as in today 's austria ) did not exist before 1918 , so it 's kind of difficult to say `` austria gained territory '' . 
  you might as well say , austria lost practically 90 % of its territory . 
  but even if we are talking about the borders of today 's austria , then no , after the treaty of st. germain some 3 million german speaking population of the former empire lived outside the borders of today 's austria ( most prominently south tyrol , but also other bordering regions ) . 
  burgenland , by the way , even then had a large german-speaking majority ( and in any case hungary managed to rip its largest city off it in a more than doubtful referendum ) . 
  but all those things happened long ago . 
  time to get over it . 
  you 're not taking my comment seriously , are you ? 
   read before you criticise . 
  i just quickly scanned it , so my fault, 
  but thanks for writing down his statements !, 
  thanks a lot , rte with its sidebar was turning me crazy :d, 
  here is a stream with interpretation : http://www.rte.ie/player/ie/live/7/ , 
  ah , changed stream , thanks, 
  in all fairness , if you are running for president of the commission , you really should be able to speak english . 
  it 's just really frustrating for me , since i would have been interested and what he has to say , but he makes it impossible for me . 
  great , tsipras speaks greek . 
  i have no freaking idea what he is saying . 
  and juncker french ( at least a language i know , but still ) . 
  finnish public broadcaster yle also streams the debate : http://areena.yle.fi/tv/2276066/#/play, 
  i only know of oberwart , unterwart and oberpullendorf having a minority . 
  well , orban does n't seem to care , 
   large hungarian communities live in romania , slovakia , serbia and ukraine after a peace treaty in 1920 sliced off large chunks of formerly hungarian territory . 
  now wait a minute , there are also three villages in eastern austria with hungarian population . 
  they should have a right to self-government too . 
  it 's downright scandalous how mr orban always forgets such an important part of the hungarian crown . 
  * obviously * it was self-defence . 
  she won , therefore she was the best . 
  this is only as ` weird ' as the contest itself . 
  if this means europe is weird , i 'm happy with that . 
  you have to see the positive side . 
  if russia annexes austria , we wo n't have to trouble ourselves with finding a venue for the next esc . 
  our glorious leader vladimir vladimirovich would host the most magnificent song contest in its history in our grand capital moscow ^ with ^ ^ arbitrary ^ ^ ^ invasions ^ ^ ^ ^ ensuing ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ afterwards, 
  60 years , actually . 
  the allies stayed in austria until 1955 . 
  yeah it 's in `` pays ne s ' \u00e9tant pas prononc\u00e9 '' - countries that have not declared their position . 
  it 's not the best colour scheme . 
  it 's on the map , but a bit difficult to spot . 
  so you do n't understand or more probably you do n't * want * to understand . 
  at times i forgot that juncker was there too . 
  i do n't know if it 's a language barrier , since you would think he should be proficient in english working high-profile on an eu level for such a long time , or if he 's unenthusiastic about his presidency or if he just did n't like the idea of this debate so much . 
  for me it was the first time hearing verhofstadt ( and keller ) talking and though i do n't agree with everything he said , one could see that he really burned for what he was believing in , and that 's something i do admire him for . 
  i do n't understand your point . 
  it 's very uncommon ( in fact i ca n't come up with a single example at the moment ) to directly vote a government ( as far as you can compare the commission with a national government ) . 
  we vote for the parliament , which basically in turn votes for the ec president . 
  yes , the council has a major say in here too , theoretically , which is probably reasonable considering the partly inter-governmental nature of the union , but in practise they wo n't be able to just smack the ep and put forward somebody completely different . 
  oh , the first map is n't up to date on the * hauptbahnhof * station . 
  the station was named * s\u00fcdtirolerplatz * ( south tyrol square ) originally , but renamed to * hauptbahnhof * ( central railway station ) some time ago due to the construction of . . well . . the central railway station there . 
  because the eu is not a state , after all . 
  it 's not only supranational , but also inter-governmental . 
  get rid of the inter-governmental component and you end up with a normal democratic state . 
  a very literal translation of the metro stations in [ vienna ] ( http://homepage.univie.ac.at/horst.prillinger/metro/m/v-english.png )  [ german version ( map including projected stations until 2017 ) ] ( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:u-bahn-netz_wien_2019.png ), 
  euronews has short introductions : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6c1mgg5oje&amp;list=plsyy1udcyyqbuq-svco32eakdskqf0d28, 
  anything beyond kuopio at least is wilding region anyway , if not all of finland , 
  but what about switzerland ? 
  well hungarian and finnish are in the same language family , but they are really really distant relatives . 
  i ran some basic words through google translate and i could only find very few similar ones : * hand = k\u00e4si ( finnish ) = k\u00e9z ( hungarian ) * water = vesi = v\u00edz * life = el\u00e4m\u00e4 = el\u00e9t on the other hand , words like fire , wood , land , sea , river , house or numbers bore no resemblance to me . 
  it 's probably kind of like comparing french and russian and wondering why they are so different even though both are indo-european . 
  not before 2006 , 
  hmm ... but my dictionary tells me `` suihku '' also means `` jet '' , while `` suihkukone '' is a `` jet aircraft '' , and `` suihkumoottori '' is a `` jet engine '' . 
  to some extent probably yes . 
  but i communicate in english almost exclusively since i am just not able to really talk in finnish except for some easy tasks . 
  i do feel confident enough now though to write messages with a finnish friend , so that helps a lot . 
  in any case finnish has always been just a fun project and as much as i love this language , i 'd rather improve my english . 
  oh me too , i 'm halfway through a2 now and i 'm not sure how to continue because sadly i will return home soon .
