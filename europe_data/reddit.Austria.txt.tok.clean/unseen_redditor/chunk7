  i would also say so . 
  two good examples for austria : during the hungarian revolution in 1956 some 200.000 hungarians fled to the west via austria ( despite complete willingness to accept them , actually posing quite a burden for post-war austria ) , many of which stayed in austria . 
  during the prague spring the ambassador of austria in prague issued visa for austria for basically anybody who wanted to , which enabled more than 160.000 czechoslovakian people to flee to austria ( although not even a tenth of them decided to stay in austria permanently ) . 
  i do n't know about the more general policy though . 
  ^ hello, 
  is n't erdogan kind of saying that the judiciary is `` undermined '' by the g\u00fclen movement , which would imply he has n't got absolute power there ? 
  ( serious question , i do n't know a lot about the latter figure ), 
   according to government reports , 1 in every 5 people ( according to some research , 1 in every 4 people ) in greenland attempts to kill themselves at some point in their lifetimes . 
  i do n't know so much about prague specifically and i 'm sure somebody from czech republic could tell you much more , but it has history . 
  a lot of history . 
  it was the capital of the kingdom of bohemia , which persisted for more than 700 years , and also capital of the holy roman empire for some time . 
  it features the oldest university in central europe . 
  jan hus preached there , consequently bohemia was the site of the hussite wars . 
  even when bohemia became a dominion of the habsburgs , rudolf ii chose prague as his seat , which ought to tell you something about the greatness of the city . 
  i think prague fared fairly well under his reign . 
  the thirty years ' war did n't go so well for bohemia and i guess it marks the end of the golden times of the city . 
  still , it ( and bohemia as such ) was an important industrial centre . 
  in modern history the prague spring is a rather notable occurrence . 
  apart from that , a lot of famous people were born , lived or studied in prague . 
  i had the pleasure to visit prague once and the city is amazing . 
  beautiful architecture , lots of history , lots of culture , delicious food and beer , and friendly people . 
  no , it 's not just a declaration of will . 
  according to the text , parliament and council will vote on it in april , which then implies that the commission has already put forward a detailed proposal to actually vote on . 
  since the press release states that parliament and council are in favour , i would say there is a good chance for this to come into effect . 
  i never had the feeling that austrians imagine their national parliament as being `` grand '' . 
  i do agree though that people certainly think less of the ep . 
  like norway , finland , estonia , denmark , austria or switzerland ? 
  i thought you also need 1 million signatures ? 
  election results for the city of salzburg , only listing the parties that made it into city parliament : sp\u00d6 ( social-dems ) : 33,0 % ( -2,8 % ) \u00d6vp ( conservative ) : 19,4 % ( -8,4 % ) greens : 13,5 % ( -2,9 % ) neos ( liberals ) : 12,4 % ( new ) fp\u00d6 ( right-extreme ) : 12,4 % ( -0,9 % ) salz ( local party ) : 3,4 % the first 4 parties will be represented in the city government . 
  neos beat fp\u00d6 by a margin of * three * votes . 
  maybe they just want finland `` back '' for historical reasons . 
  well the nazis had a different concept of `` aryan people '' though . 
  i guess in this book it merely refers to indo-iranian people as in the ethnicity living in that region . 
  i could rather see that happen the other way round, 
  meh , i prefer the adriatic sea and i think we have better claims on trieste than sevastopol . 
  we should lease a warm water port . 
  trieste maybe ? 
  ( what could possibly go wrong ? ),

  but what if you eat it ulkona ? 
  * na * , that 's a * fleischlaberl *, 
  the ukrainian ministry of defence confirmed the ultimatum , russia denies it . 
  one of them is n't saying the truth . 
  there 's a chance that this is a false report though . 
  edit : well , ukrainian ministry of defence confirmed it , russia denied it . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish_armed_forces#equipment has roughly the same numbers, 
  i see you deleted your account , but i 'll still give you an answer . 
  first of all , i do n't know what the russian government wants or does not want . 
  i am sure they 're not so crazy to * want * world war iii , but i 'm sure that was n't the intention of austria-hungary either ( or to some extent even nazi-germany ) . 
  in any case i fail to see how mobilizing your troops and massing them on the ukrainian border is easing the situation . 
  so far it only let to the mobilization of the ukrainian military . 
  even if russia never planned to actually go into ukraine , it created a lot of tension , tension that might lead somebody somewhere to do something stupid , intentional or not , and possibly either side would feel compelled to react . 
  and then we could have war . 
  so , how will russian * military * involvement prevent ( civil ) war ? 
  there are other means to push your agenda before sending in troops . 
  now the ukrainian government feels threatened from the inside * and * the outside . 
  good job on that de-escalation . 
  your world seems rather black and white , if you do n't see any possibilities besides doing nothing and declaring war [ 1 ] . 
  if the point is not to escalate anything , than declaring war on another country generally is not a good means to do so . 
  and again , the legitimacy of the current government just does n't play a role here ( as a side note : there are elections coming up ) . 
  this is not about ideology , this is about action and reaction . 
  russia moves troops into ukraine ? 
  ukrainian government will react . 
  so tell me , how would war make the situation in crimea and all of ukraine any better ? 
  [ 1 ] i am aware that no war has been declared , but russia is moving in this direction and solely the threat of war has n't done any good so far as far as i see it . 
  the question of the legitimacy of the current government of ukraine does n't really play that big of a role in this case though . 
  if russia decides to move troops into ukraine , it is violating the sovereignty of ukraine and the government will have no other option except reacting to this . 
  if it is only in the interest of russia to protect ethnic russians in crimea , then there are better solutions than war . 
  personally i still do n't think russia will go through with this , but with a guy like putin you never know . 
  scholarships are bound to your progress though . 
  yes , of course austria cheats with the numbers , pretty much every country does . 
  but the map depicts eurostat numbers , not national ones . 
  still money you have to pay , in addition to housing , food , etc. , so you ca n't just study as long as you want if you do n't have parents financing you or look for a job . 
  i do n't see how you can explain austria doing fairly well in youth unemployment solely by saying `` studying is free '' . 
  look at sweden , look at finland . 
  if you 're two semesters above the minimum number of semesters you have to pay a tuition fee too . 
  it 's also not like during the economic crisis everybody just enrolled in university . 
  also , the top 10 european travel destinations on a world-wide basis , listed by arrivals in 2012 ( source : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tourism_rankings ) : 1 france 83.0 million ( population : 56.8 ) 2 spain 57.7 million ( population : 46.7 ) 3 italy 46.4 million ( population : 59.9 ) 4 turkey 35.7 million ( population : 76.7 ) 5 germany 30.4 million ( population : 80.6 ) 6 uk 29.3 million ( population : 63.7 ) 7 russia 25.7 million ( population : 143.7 ) 8 austria 24.1 million ( population : 8.5 ) 9 ukraine 23.0 million ( population : 45.4 ) 10 greece 15.5 million ( population : 10.8 ), 
  i believe the title and name is just pinned on . 
  what struck me was that the emblem of lower austria looks different on his jacket . 
  yes my association was he just saw a puppy deer drowning in the floods . 
  he 's been governor for almost a quarter of a century now , so he 's had time to practise . 
  amateurs . 
  [ the governor of lower austria ] ( http://www.noen.at/storage/pic/artikelbilder/aktuell/1012330_1_d4l_1499.jpg?version=1370278505 ), 
  as far as i know it 's a serious , secular , kind of centrist ( ? ), 
  newspaper . 
  oh , seems like i released confidential imagery .

  no , we hide others in our basements . 
  austria would probably hide under the table so that the others would hopefully forget that we are there too . 
  spaniards are n't too fond of sauna in my experience :d, 
  oh no , i 'm staying in finland so that 's actually my own conclusion . 
  i do n't know about home-made coffee , but the normal kahvi at caf\u00e9s tends to be pretty weak ( to the effect that i do n't feel it at all ) and not particularly good in my opinion . 
  so my suspicion was kind of that finns drink so many cups of coffee a day because there 's hardly any real coffee in them  but yes , of course you can get actual coffee too at some places ( it 's just a bit too expensive for me ), 
  having learned about finnish coffee : you ca n't really describe that as coffee anyway . 
  that 's more like water with some traces of coffee which has been standing on a warm plate for at least six hours . 
  i would say `` true names '' and '' ( one of many possible ) literal translations '' is n't the same thing .
