  * it 's darned hot . 
  it 's just a historically different approach . 
  just like protestant/anglican countries tend to have a state church and a state religion , while some former communist countries are much more secular . 
  clerical austrofacism ended some 75 years ago , give it some time , the influence of religion is clearly diminishing . 
  i just wanted to say that it 's not as bad as your first post made it look like . 
  89 % in 3:58.2 not easy . 
  97 % in 1:07.3 apparently i clicked on italy when placing san marino . 
  damn those small nations . 
  adding to what / u/schindetnemo already said : many people do in fact see the cross in public buildings not as a symbol of religion or even dominance of christianity but rather some kind of cultural thing ( like * gr\u00fc\u00df gott * is a purely cultural greeting formula to me ) . 
  i 'm not christian , but really , that cross never bothered me . 
  also , if a class has a majority of non-christian students the cross has to be removed ( i think someone sued some time ago ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure that the whole prayer thing is about to become extinct . 
  i remember that we went to church on the first day of elementary school ( which was kinda awkward ) but even that stopped after my first year . 
  we never had any prayers . 
  maybe that 's still a bit different in more religious , rural environments . 
  relating to the * konkordat * : no , it is * not * part of our constitution . 
  most of the privileges of the catholic church ( or probably all of them ) are granted to the other legally accepted religions ( * gesetzlich anerkannte religionsgemeinschaften * ) since the state has to treat them equally . 
  some financial aspects do bother me , but apart from that i do n't really see why people often kinda demonise it . 
  all told while there certainly are some issues to be looked at , your assertion that we would `` blow the scale '' is pretty exaggerated in my humble opinion . 
  yeah i wondered too . 
  sure , a government including the conservative \u00d6vp will probably act more on `` christian values '' , but that 's about it . 
  most of all i do n't see how our constitution is `` tightly related '' to religious institutions . 
  wait , your list is n't correct , those are not the `` least religious countries '' , but rather the most atheist countries . 
  least religious countries can be seen on page 9 : 1 . 
  china ( 14 ) 2 . 
  japan ( 16 ) 3 . 
  czech republic ( 20 ) 4 . 
  turkey ( 23 ) 5 . 
  sweden ( 29 ) 6 . 
  australia ( 37 ) 8 . 
  france ( 37 ) 9 . 
  any insight into ( on ? ), 
  the views of parliament on the topic ? 
  what happens if the mps reject the petition ? 
  wait , brits actually think they are being ripped off ? 
  even with higher shipping costs amazon.co.uk oftentimes is cheaper than buying games here . 
  and thus began the great anglo-french war of homosexuality . 
  ** austria ** i did n't read news regularly this week , but this seems to be our only main story this week ( continuing from last week 's headline ) : * an 18-year-old serving a sentence for theft committed suicide . 
  more reports of violence and sexual abuse amongst adolescents in prison . 
  apparently there is both too few staff and adequate accommodation , so the ministry of justice was in instructed to see what can be done about it . 
  ah , i can see how it probably was omitted some years ago ( kinda like in the beginning of the second republic kids did n't study nazism ) , but i learned a lot about the first republic and especially the st\u00e4ndestaat , so that changed . 
  uhm ... no, 
  homeland of the awesome lady who created [ scandinavia and the world ] ( http://satwcomic.com/ ), 
  obviously i 'm not swiss , but to my knowledge that 's because of their system . 
  firstly , they have a lot of referenda where important questions are decided on anyway . 
  secondly they have an extremely consistent and stable * konkordanzdemokratie * ( consociationalism ) including the so-called [ magic formula ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magic_formula ) making change less likely and therefore elections less important . 
  though i think the svp broke through that system in recent years . 
  wow , that 's almost 60m higher than our [ lowest point ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apetlon ) . 
  47/47 3:22 ( though i had to look up the english spelling of moldova ) this one 's pretty awesome too , though you have to sign up when not playing on world level : http://www.tripadvisor.com/tiqgame, 
  i typed in * luxemburg * and wondered why it 's wrong - . -, 
  nothing noteworthy to my knowledge . 
  some statements that forcing a presidential plane to reroute is n't an awfully nice thing to do , but the general consensus seems to be that the incident is n't our business . 
  ** austria ** * the evo morales affair . 
  after quite a bit of confusion , our president clarified that morales ' plane was , in fact , not searched . 
  * austrian retailer ` dayli ' is bankrupt ... again . 
  no-one 's surprised . 
  * a monarchist party wants to run for election . 
  they want , quote `` swiss democracy with a crown on top of it '' . 
  whatever that means . 
  that 's another episode . 
  the ambassador of spain in vienna thought he is a sneaky guy and asked morales to have a cup of coffee in his plane . 
  morales declined . 
  [ he is  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qouvrpiqsm ), 
  we do n't know what exactly happened , but i do n't see any reason why morales should have complied if he did n't want to . 
  ( austrian ) federal president heinz fischer said morales asked him to `` express his great gratitude for the hospitality and the excellent and correct treatment during his unplanned stopover to the republic of austria and the austrian authorities . '', 
  that does n't really sound displeased to me . 
  there was some kind of a voluntary ` inspection ' approved by morales , otherwise austrian authorities would n't be allowed to do that . 
  i 've read that actually no austrian officials were * in * the airplane . 
  anyway , nothing was done without consent of bolivia . 
  our president even visited morales at the airport to see that everything was fine . 
  the author of this article ( and other news outlets ) claim though austria somehow participated in it . 
  morales thanked austria for its hospitality , we have n't done anything vile :(, 
  so the euro-skeptics in efd and ecr are fine with us surveillance ? 
  man , i 'm just relieved our government did n't participate in this idiocy . 
  okay , apparently our state radio does n't check the credibility of its sources ... 
  thanks for the clarification . 
  i heard it on the radio . 
  cia world fact book [ confirms ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html ) it . 
  ha okay , let 's see if they like it, 
  pala\u010dinke is palatschinke in austrian german , that 's why i mentioned it, 
  * catholic , quite religious i think * inventors of the cravat , made fashionable by the french king * ban josip jela\u010di\u0107 is a national hero . 
  helped put down the 1848 uprising , fought for autonomy from hungary while staying within the austrian empire . 
  * yugoslav war * has some extremely beautiful nature and is known for its stone beaches . 
  * 1/4 of direct foreign investments come from austria . 
  * has a rather strange suffrage : general voting age is 18 ; only if you have a job , you 're allowed to vote beginning with 16 . 
  ( e : as / u/om _ nom_toilet_paper pointed out , that 's actually not true ) * pala\u010cinke, 
  haha , the cutest [ perchten ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre-christian_alpine_traditions ) i have ever seen : http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=mxzryke4wiw#t=3320s what are they symbolising though ? 
  i read it in the newspaper today , here 's a [ link ] ( http://kurier.at/politik/eu/faymann-im-interview-zum-eu-beitritt-kroatiens-kroatiens-beitritt-foerdert-die-wirtschaft/17.354.955#section-17355574 ) ( in german ) 46 % for , 29 % against , 22 % do n't care , 3 % no answer . 
  i could be though that this is in fact not the highest support ever , but rather the highest support among current candidate countries / countries who would like to join . 
  i think i misread the sentence ( hey , it was early in the morning and i was tired ) . 
  well actually we do n't do that , which made me wonder how that happened either , but maybe the inmates were adolescents/teens too after all . 
  * a 14-year-old boy in investigative custody was raped by three adult ( e : not sure ) inmates . 
  our minister of justice did n't seem to care a lot saying things like `` prison is not paradise '' . 
  she later apologised and said it was the judge 's fault . 
  * something complicated : in 2005 parts of the right-wing fp\u00d6 split and formed the bz\u00d6 . 
  the core province of bz\u00d6 was carinthia . 
  after some time ( and after the death of haider , the figurehead of bz\u00d6 ) most of the more prominent figures of the bz\u00d6 in carinthia formed the fpk , a sister party of the fp\u00d6 only active in carinthia ( kinda like the cdu/csu thing in germany ) . 
  parts of the fp\u00d6 in carinthia did n't like that though and refused to move into the fpk . 
  and now , after the tremendous election defeat of the fpk and much quarreling it was decided this week that the fpk is incorporated into the fp\u00d6 again . 
  about 200 of the 500 delegates to the party convention where that was decided did n't even show up though .
