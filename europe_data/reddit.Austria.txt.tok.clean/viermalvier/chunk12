  so hundred years is enough to be forgiven starting a worldwar and causing the deaths of millions of your people , pff . 
  and hey im all against sippenhaftung , but in this case were their whole power comes through being part of the family ... - if a company would be guilty of tax evading they wouldnt be less guilty when they change their ceo . 
  well having the castles and palais without monarchs is pretty good for tourism too . 
  i dont agree with the comments here , it isnt because trump or the special voting system - at least in the newspapers i consume , the us presidential election is always covered a lot and since it was the first real voting it would get some headlines for sure . 
  ( not first site maybe but still one of the bigger ones ) / e here for example : http://derstandard.at/2000030622000/us-vorwahlen-hochspannung-vor-naechster-bewaehrungsprobe-in-new-hampshire you can see the other articles to that topic on the right slider - 22 articles since the day after iowa, 
  i have made an account at a german bank , which doesnt have any austrian branches , whats the difference ? 
  if affordable daycare is availlable in the whole country and its possible for fathers to split their babyleave half , half ( no matter where he works ) so families can choose the way they `` operate '' the family and arent forced in some way - then i would call it right . 
  well ive heard zigeina , but thats complete different story :p, 
  there is nothing ( democratic ) right of the csu . 
  better inform yourself about german politics before posting ... 
  thx, 
  posted from a pole thats really funny . 
  lets split up the richest country in europe , we take the poorest part with no industry and the highest nazi ratio per captia - what could go wrong , 
  hui kids , i think its bedtime already   having been to burgenland ~ ~ gradi\u0161\u0107e ~ ~ , can confirm . 
  rightful ~ ~ magyar ~ ~ ~ ~ croat ~ ~ austrian clay . 
  + \u00d6denburg and pressburg ofc, 
  sounds about right ( maybe my thoughts wouldnt be that explicite :  ), 
  mhm , that stupid bigger corridor , if they had waited ten more minutes , we would have seen a more fair competition and most likely a prevc win in obersdorf . 
  but hey , ard cant pospone their schumi docu right ... 
   on the nye there are 250 000 tourists so a third of the amount of ski jumping visitors ? 
  how is the system in finland , do you have a `` economic parliament '' where every employee and employer is represented or like the anglo countries where unions are just responsible for their members ? 
  thats a typical myth that just doesnt die , sry , but the nazis were fucking awful at governing - a highly corrupt system , buying the people support by throwing money at them . 
  just go to / r/askhistorians there are dozens of threads about it ... 
  sounds like a solid plan , 
  sry , but can you use real units , at least in this sub , i mean even football fields or bath tubes would be better ... 
  explain pl0x ? 
   there is also belarus and russia but they ca n't even apply if they wanted to . 
  why ? 
  ( i dont want to read that whole wiki page pls . ), 
  would be interesting if the guys in the 3rd floor renovated the wall or just glued some wallpaper above it ( since it looks so symmetrical :d ), 
  dont forget his partner in crime , [ herbert `` huankinda '' prohaska ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqakxisx7jg ), 
  i wish i could say that to you too ... 
  orf1 weekends : skiracing , skijumping , football , formula1 and adam sandler movies at primetime . 
  orf1 weekdays : us sitcomes and thrillers 24/7 ( some disney kids shows at midday ) orf2 : old people talk shows and shows all day , good news and some informative magazines late at night . 
  ( and tatort on sunday < 3 ), 
  well im only talking out of memory here , but there were quite some neutral/allied targets ( maybe if they would have been taken by nato ), 
   not the safest place to live during the cold war i guess . 
  mhm , i remember i once saw a thread ussr nuclear targets , berlin , vienna , even budapest i think - so yeah berlin would have been fucked anyways ... 
   they told me they liked sopron , if that comes from brugenl\u00e4nder you shouldnt be happy about it :3 btw , hows your team , didnt saw them much - but i heard you got a new de_fence ^ ^ ^ ^ ehehehehh , ^ ^ ^ ^ sry ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ will ^ ^ ^ ^ go ^ ^ ^ ^ away ^ ^ ^ ^ :d, 
  and the 2nd place has a good chance to face off against slovakia ( 2nd group b ), 
   i learned this the hard way well i certainly feel some schadenfreude over this , its really not nice :(, 
  really ? 
  i call that a mohn/nussstrudel , thats a [ striezel ] ( https://www.steirische-spezialitaeten.at/images/stories/rezepte/striezel-mit-rosinen.jpg ) for me, 
   goulash is great , but december is beigli i can only see strudel there :3, 
  who , the kp\u00f6 , i cant imagine they have enough money for something like that ? 
  whats the difference to the plasma you get when you are plasma welding or cutting ? 
  lol im a moron , i overread the 23rd june part , sry :d, 
   can i ask where i shall send my account number so german gov can wire me some money ? 
  i heard that the german government delayed security locks for audis for ~ 30years ? 
  do you burn something in june too ( when summer begins ) ? 
  he didnt create them , but was their leader for quite some time . 
  naaah , they are die beste band der welt !, 
  puh , the us airforce can be happy that swedes dont think like that, 
  no absolutly not ( yet ) - as long as there isnt a really strong parliament who can control it we wold just create orwells worst dream . 
  just look at your powerful , well established bundestag and how the bnd plays cat and mouse with it . 
  executive powers will always attract a certain `` law and order '' kind of people , witch is fine ( i think ) as long as there is proper supervision and its not them to decide whats best for the country . 
  the greens were on 2nd place in polls after fukushima . 
  so if you want to have a peaceful society the secret is to be unfriendly to expats in your country ? 
  :d since they are part of the `` elite '' who do they make responsible for the chemtrails , murcians , jews , russians ? 
  they were already on the move months before merkel even said something ( there were a lot of threads back then about how again she wants to sit this out ) , but hey who doesnt like an easy scapegoat . 
  panieren , you can do that with everything, 
  guada hadern , although i dont understand next to anything  ) ), 
  who cares , the flemish got the english curse , no big germany , france and spain - who in the world could stop the combined austrian-swiss-czech-croatian-slovenian football team, 
  i could live with that , 
  y , sounds reasonable, 
  sorry but that is a pretty romantic view of the war , ww2 was the same as the one before - because a country ( the third reich ) tried to gain an economic advantage by invading/destroying its enemies . 
  the real slaughtering of the shoa happened when the whole world was already in the war , to call that the reason for the allies engagement sounds good in a hollywood movie but doesnt reflect the reality, 
  here too , learned it in highschool . 
  it just looks way better . 
  ( if you are able to write , not like lousy op ... ), 
  y sure , i was just confirming your first sentence . 
  for every beautiful support there is a ( almost ) bald carry , 
   unless you get access to the fountain yourself . 
  when im at a mcdonalds once in a while -  spezi time  ) ), 
  alaba goal thread on / r/soccer , at least one or two `` best austrian since hitler '' for sure ~ . ~, 
   the fact that neither happened is just not acceptable to me and should n't be to anyone i would take the decision of a polish judge over yours anyday ... 
  haha , we use the same here , 
  better go to bed kiddo . 
  the facts you edited after i posted ? 
  your post was a sole anti israel rant nothing about iran ... 
  good first comment , but then this , yeah , ... you are just the same moron as the one above you , why cant there be some sane people in this middle eastern discussions ... 
   negotiated by obama maybe you should listen to other news sources to fox news ... 
  well if you look at the steps in between : cultural nearest to the german would be the bavarian ( :p ) and to them the austrians , from here the language changes but if you look at cuisine , festivites , historical buildings/cities the hungarians arent far off . 
  now a bit more of southern flavour is coming in on the way to transilvania , new language again - but the rest very similar , and since romania = moldovia ( more or less :  ) we are at the end of the chain . 
  like someone in / r/de wrote , in 2007 you could blame the lack of knowledge , but now its vorsatz ... 
  the archduke , so von der leyen in this case , 
  when they raided and pilaged our poor central european villages . 
  900ac never forget !, 
  ever heard of vat ? 
  the website says the last vote on this topic was on april 3rd in 2014 , but i cant find any data for this day on votewatch.eu , maybe someone other can find something since it would be interesting who was in favour/against it the last time . 
  ~ 90 % of us legislation is done on the state level , only foreign , military and some fiscal/market things are done on the union one . 
  yeah , the union had ~ 41 % with a voter turnout of ~ 70 % , so only around ~ 28 % of all germans ( who are allowed to vote ) voted for her . 
   if you have one of the new german id cards , you have provided a biometric picture to the brd gmbh anyway . 
  fyp . 
  beer , pork and paprika europe, 
  the morning show ( 6am to 10am ) is in english + some news in french , 
   anyways , it 's pretty shitty for vienna . 
  red/green spent a lot of money and the fp\u00f6 promised to keep every job and to build 10000 flats per year ... 
  sry but thats not true , they always propose other systems like australia , but are clearly not against mirgration . 
  maybe just dont listen to your wirtshaus buddies ...
