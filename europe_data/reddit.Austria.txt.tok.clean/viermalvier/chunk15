  if the uk wants an trade deal thats ok for both parties , we will live with it . 
  well , we have exact the same story , just that our ( babenberger ) lord was a crusader . 
  if you are as good as in alpine skiing you cerntainly need that practice , 
  im on my way to the westbahnhof and even planning to buy two cheesburgers - goodbye world :( ... and the chechens mostly came under the black/blue goverment and yet these parties are craweling up putins arse , the one responsible for them beeing here in the first place . 
  what is illusional if you are helping other people in your freetime when your politicans are failing to do so - black , blue , red politicans failed to impliment good eu wide asylum rules , or were cutting the auslandshilfen , they are at fault for the refugeewave , yet you blame the civil population who was filling in for the holes of state authority ... 
  lol , people emigrating in a `` pre-erdogan '' ( as if there were no elected islamic leaders there before ) were way more likely to be religious than people emigrating now - just because a certain group holds most of the power now doesnt make the whole population radically religious over night . . 
  is this more an an puplicity stunt from the government or do you think she is really interested in a political career . 
  her brother was known for some questionable statements on certain regimes 75 years ago , where does she stand ? 
  haha , 
  haha , that not true , there was no fraud - the fpoe said for two months that they have evidence and will bring it to the courts , in the end they had nothing . . 
  the postal voted werent counted according to the official procedure in a lot of places , thats why we have to vote again . 
  well if it was just merkel and sch\u00e4uble , but most european goverments think that way . 
  i mean after sarkozy lost to hollande , spain was merkel biggest ally in the eurozone . 
  you are saying austerity is hurting your country still the majority of your countrymen voted conservative again . 
  the benelux countries , finland , ireland , slovakia and austria are all on that dont spend more than you earn train . 
  and they like it that merkel stands in front and has to do the dirty work . 
  dont missunderstand me , we think alike , but you need to stop to think of the eu as an `` dictatorship '' , we have a proper democratic system . 
  if there would be a strong anti austerity alliance they just could outvote merkel and others - the problem there is none . 
  i mean we have social dems in two of the biggest euro countries with hollande and renzi , yet they didnt manage to speak with one voice and also get some of the smaller countries to back them , thats the sad thruth ( if fillon wins , we wont see a change the next decade im sure : / ), 
  but my culture is also different from these nationalists - in my culture its a bad thing - why should their values be more important than mine ? 
  yes people are afraid of survaillance , but not because it limits the personal freedom , but because it would be hard to pay your `` neighbour '' for fixing your car or building your swimmingpool or renovate your flat . 
  the last ten years one interior minister after another tried some ridicoulus shit - vorratsdatenspeicherung , bundestrojaner , ... and the general public didnt bat an eye ( got ta get dem terrorists ! ), 
  [ here ] ( http://www.formula2.net/zeltweg197101.jpg ) is a picture of the old \u00d6sterreichring which did run around the little forest you see on the left, 
  in the blink of an eye, 
   i still believe merkel 's idea was to bring people in germany to help with the aging population problem etc. 
  i also belive that 4 x 4 = 15, 
  holy fuck , what a song :0, 
  dont change the topic , you were talking about mulims living there , most of them citizens of commonwealth nations = their former colonies and the reason the uk is as rich/important as it is today . 
  so your `` our ancestors fought long , bitter wars to keep them out and we simply let them walk back in '' just doesnt fit for the uk, 
  im pretty sure more muslims died defending the uk in wwii than brits died due islamic terror attacks . 
  we already have \u00d6xit , which doesnt sound to bad imo ( the name ), 
  gabriel is fm , not schulz ? 
   if you dont pay for the services you use , you are the product , not the customer . 
  what ? 
  thats not the problem at all , companies that get paid dor their services use you data too . 
  if everyone would use more free ( open source ) services that would be good - ofc it takes more adjustment of the users, 
  no pig no competition srys !, 
  i think it also has a lot to do how easy they are to pronounce \u010cesk\u00e9 bud\u011bjovice , lwiw , warszawa arent rolling out easily in german while bratislava , sopron , liberec are easy going ... 
   there is an european budweiser an there is an ameri ... lulz fyp, 
  maybe you do i the other way around , like us , [ meat on the outside vegetables on the inside ] ( http://images.ichkoche.at/data/image/variations/496x384/2/rezept-fuer-wachauer-rindsrouladen-img-17865.jpg ) ?

  three , as far as i know https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/39r2dl/bananas_of_europe_2000x1744/, 
  two things you only get here ( and neighbouring countries ) i think are [ mannerschnitten ] ( https://www.fromaustria.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/m/a/manner_schnitten_grosspackung.jpg ) and [ almdudler ] ( https://pizza-plus.at/image/data/getrenke/almdudler.jpeg ), 
  i mean this is mostly about tourists , but i have to rant about my fellow countrymen too - i think austrians wouldnt be able to form an ordely queue even if their life depends on it , i never saw a queue here where not some selfentitled pricks were skipping because the whole world just waits for them . . 
   reich mode triggered nation-wide .

  i think they usually dont have our `` table '' toilets so its less splattering , but im a sitzpinkler too so donno . . 
  so if i cook ( real food not noodles or rice with ketchup ) home and only buy the cheapest products at hofer/aldi i can live with ~ 50 $ ( including the fraction of hygenic and cleaning products ) if im buying only the bio alternatives , eating out once or twice , buying an espresso to go in the morning , living the good live etc. 
  it can go up to 150 $, 
  if you like driving you could check out the gro\u00dfglockner hochalpenstra\u00dfe ( high alpine street ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mhjptdpgii in austria , its goes up to 2500m and you can enjoy great views . 
  i once took a international construction management lecture and all the lecturers agreed the communication problems usually start when there are englishmen or us-americans involved , 
  heineken does have a `` premium '' position here too , kinda . 
  you usually only get it in clubs/discos as bottles and the 0,33 l is more expensive than the 0,5 l local beer . 
  i only heard it the way i translated it , but we usually use piefke instead of german in the end  but i guess it works the other way around too :d, 
  i would also recommend kozel from czech rep. ( i think they export a lot too , at least in europe ) my personal favourite is the zwettler export lager , but i dont know if you get it outside from austria , they are a small private brewery . 
   no wonder . 
  it is the first time ~ ~ for quite long time ~ ~ that they qualified without being host . 
  fyp , only worldcups so far , 
  a german , a austrian and a kenyan man sitting in the hospital and waiting for each of their wives to giving birth . 
  later the doctor comes out `` the good news - your wives are healthy , the bad news - we accidently mixed the babies '' . 
  when in front of the three babies the austrian quickly goes to the black baby , takes it out , and snuggles with it . 
  the kenyan man asks him `` dont you think it could be mine one ? '', 
  the austrian answers `` sure thing , but do you think i would risk taking the german one ? '', 
  he is kinda right , international treaties doesnt mean much if you are a powerful country . 
  so if the other eu countires or the us ( russia kinda lost its status ) are ok with it , we could change our state treaty and join germany . 
  its already a bit washed up , since the eu is a economic union and that wasnt allowed either . 
  but you are right too , its no topic anyways . 
  i mean there are some people , but they usually come from the german culture/race/people  others corner ... 
  mens dont want it . 
   alternatively you can read werther by g\u00f6the , or `` die neuen leiden des jungen w. '' by plenzdorf , the werther situation in a 70s ddr setting . 
  yeah , thats why they are cheaper, 
  well its not uncommon here in vienna too , this dorms are spread over the city and its cheaper then sharing a flat with others . 
  portland or seattle , only hear good things from there . 
  cold winters , some football culture , focus on good city infrastructure ( cycling ) , if im not misstaken . 
  / e ah not to live there ^ ^ maybe new york then . 
   trst is in ** a ** u ** s ** tr ** ia ** now . 
  thank you very much friend !, 
  sleppers have beds on one side so there are max three , couchettes are on both sides of the door so 4 and 6 ( at least thats what i get from the link above ) / e oh he/she posted this later nvm , 
  i suppose lg hellas may be a daugther of lg but still is an independent company and so only have to care about products they sell . 
  innsbruck is in and salzburg is near the alps , munich would be the best adress if you want to be near the mountains and still have a `` city live feeling '' ( i cant make any comments to the quality of the studies at this location ), 
  usually a lot of partys , not because of halloween per se , but since the next day is a christian holiday its another chance to get wasted , 
  what i know , and as others in the thread here explained , germany is only slightly worse than the nordic states :  in germany 40h/week is the norm , we also have around 25-26d holidays per year . 
  you require a sick note after staying more than 2d at home . 
  you have to do at least 30min of lunch break , to a max . 
  of 1h . 
  wait , where is the planica song , he was  200, 
  only the vorteilscard < 26 is 20 $ , the classic one for people older than 26 years is 99 $ so it depends on your age, 
  sry , alpine skiing ofc for my defense , in german all the `` nordic disciplines '' ( except skijumping ) dont have the word for skiing in their names so im not used to differ . 
  although its a catholic church , the karlskirche ( charles church ) in vienna , finished in 1739 , was modeled after the hagia sophia http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/karlskirche_wien.jpg so in my eyes the argument mosques dont fit in our landscapes isnt valid when one of the most famous buildings in vienna actually look like one , 
  i dont have any clue about music related jobs or payment , but you can see a lot of ( mostly asian ) kids with their instrument boxes walking around in vienna - so i assume you can find a job here . 
  on the otherside - austrians ( especially viennese ) tend to be a bit on the pesimistic side , not just towards europe but in general worldviews  whats maybe better , even our very right nationalists dont want to get out of the union anymore - they hating on the euro instead . 
  vienna is now the 2nd biggest german speaking city and still rapidly growing - the negative side to that is the rise of housing costs . 
  for public transport you pay 365 $ a year ( = 1 $ a day ) and you wont need a car . 
  ( de ) tatort !, 
  nearly every sunday 20:15, 
  i would use football for football and american football for american football , 
  a lot of people in the east of austria go to see hungarian dentists , since they are seen as good as ours but way cheaper ( maybe less over the years now ) . 
  usually for the things that arent covered by the social security system , but often you get operations that are covered recognized too and you get your money back . 
  at some time to that extend that there are bus tours to border near cities , whats creates a problem for hungarian people on the otherside since the dentists get expensiver in this regions too . .
