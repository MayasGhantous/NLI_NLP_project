  you cant vote for yourself, 
   tass did note , however , that russian players such as alex ovechkin , yevgeny malkin , viktor tikhonov and dmitry kulikov remained on the ice during the anthem , and that ovechkin and malkin tried to stop their teammates from leaving the ice . 
  should be mentioned here too . 
  / e ok as the finns said , they left pretty quickly too .

  lol , wait till a german club is making such a choreo :d, 
  are we getting the plattensee or is it more east ? 
  ( lake balaton ), 
   trying to keep rural areas artificially alive is idiotic and detrimental to the countrys economy is it the topmost requirement that humans have to live in a economic efficient way ? 
  im still at university , but working one or two days a week and my boss offered me a 4day week too after im finished ( for me to choose , i could work 5days too ) if im staying with them . 
   or do you work 8 hours on 3 days of week 4 days you mean ? 
   the western world has n't been good friends to us . 
  ( which is true ) sure , the only goal of the eu is to make the lifes of greeks as hard as possible .

  german hating slavs voluntarily helped the nazis ? 
   we have the organization called the bloc identitaire , same here , together with some student leagues who still dream of greater germany , 
  of course a greater albania sympathizer would say something like that !!!, 
  is russia in too ? 
  its mostly when watching sport and a little `` piefke '' here and there , sometimes politics ( medicine students , autbahn toll ) , on the other side everything is compared to germany . 
  i always remember back when i was younger , i attended a marriage from someone in the bigger family on the same day as the 2002 world cup finale . 
  its was a usual rural restaurant where they have a big ceremony room and in the front a smaller bar room where the local people gather and watched tv . 
  so there i was , a little boy in a room full of older/old farmers - everyone of them cheering for brazil :d quite a impressing event . 
  kk , interesting  do n't you have some operators which do instant bank transfers ? 
  i dont know , everyone i know does things like that with cash on the hand , so im curious , 
  do you have a script written for that answer ? 
  im pretty sure italy is recognising german, 
  ah , i forgot to write - i was mainly talking about private transfers . 
  well but a bank transfer does need a whole amount of trust right ? 
  if i give you the car and then only get the money two days later you have enough time to be over all hills . 
  maybe they were chinese/korean and you offended them ? 
  i dont giggle internally because i know now its a schm\u00e4hfreie ( joke free ) zone . 
  what the gun is for some muricans , cash is for me - sometimes you need to be irrational . 
  btw im curious , how do you buy/sell cars for example in the nordic and other card heavy countries ? 
  8x germania , i thought you like good food ? 
  but on the serious side , a really wonderful tradition !, 
  well , at least the sarcasm in pic 6 is debateable , 
  [ `` sure '' ] ( http://broer.no/bro/b/b39_1.jpg ), 
  lolz , that from a user who is named after the patron of hungary ... 
  huh ? 
  jerusalem is the capital , the knesset is there . 
  its the usual polit journalism to take a location of power as a phrase ? 
  you cant dismiss a whole country just because there are some shitheads there . 
   in finland , the unions negotiate with whole industries how is it chosen which union does negotiate , or does everyone for themselfs ? 
  in austria for example every five years the representatives for workes and employers in every field are voted , so the actual unions act like political parties and try to get there people voted in . 
  usually the employers side is dominated by the conservative near organisations and the employees side by the social democratic near ones . 
  well that was ullis doing - the money is made with the vip tickets and the supporters , a bunch of them at least , get reasonable priced dauerkarten ( which are usually booked for generations ) . 
  hopefully he is returning next week and helping the m\u00fcnchner bayern before going to the netherlands !, 
   there 's a significant difference between situation of austria and situation of poland/czechoslovakia . 
  `` austria as a first victim '' is a myth created after the ww2 . 
  and usually i do n't care about that , but in this particular discussion it was relevant . 
  if poland is now considered a successor of prl , i see no reason not to consider austria a successor of nazi germany . 
  it is your good right to see austria as morally successor of nazi germany too , but that doesnt change the fact that legally it isnt . 
  this `` austria = first victim '' isnt a myth , it was the outcome of the negotiations between austrian politicians and the allied powers and was the base ground for our independence treaty . 
  again , its your good right to see this as morally not correct but still there isnt a legal ground for it . 
  and well my top comment was meant as joke , hence the ''  '' . . 
  woot , we are the first victim my friend , germany is the sole successor !, 
  so im waiting for your money while listening to glorious austrian componist beethoven . 
  very nice , now give back money pls  http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/16/business/poland-is-granted-large-cut-in-debt.html, 
   there are ** plenty of non-austrians ** who subscribe to that ( somewhat fringe ... ) branch of economics called `` austrian school economics '' , etc. 
  well if that wouldnt happen , the world would be a better place, 
  i think this looks like a usual main square in a lot of central ( ? ), 
  european cities . 
  iirc from the parliament houses series , the croatian parliament is placed on such a square , 
  we can hope , 
   there ancestors who were illegal immigrants in other countires i know of the mass emigration waves to america back in the days , but did a considerable amount come back ? 
  i was always under the assumption that most of the emmigrated did that for forever . 
  10th of february 2013 best day of my life , remove germany from olympic premises , germany you are of worst german , 
  and they all march there without violence ? 
  thats very nice . 
  whats the story behind the clokwerk orange outfits of the guys from 3:22 ( `` workers of the world , unite ! '' ), 
  oh and ofc --  6:38 - `` antiwar democratic march '' = se best  although the greens does have some good sound . 
  hf at your windmill fight, 
   after wwi the republic of german austria only purpose was to join germany well thats a very broad simplification , and you got quite a junk of gold from us too - reparations pl0x !, 
   they should pay a part of these reperations . 
  if i would possess any decision power i would be in favour of that . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu9jirvxtx4 sums it up pretty good , for the ones able to understand german . 
  lol, 
   and usually when a far-right party comes forward , people rightfully feel afraid and start running in the opposite direction and very commonly ending up with left government sry you make it look like hollande is at the opposite of fn , hollande like sarkozy is a centrist politican and in no way france has a `` left '' government . 
  well imo it could go very bad for labour , if the snp start to think in a bigger picture the people soon will see that there is a party that really deserves the name labour ( hint its not the current one ) . 
  as long as the drone pilots stay ~ . ~, 
  they 're the far left in disguise lolz , you made my day, 
  to be fair schelling does an acceptable job imo and most importantly he does n't give a shit about some moronic landesh\u00e4uptlinge and their crude ideas . 
  that was mine already , but thanks .
