  what 's going on with all the german countries that are not austria/germany/switzerland ? 
  why are they german ? 
  thieves . 
  yeah i meant austin i guess . 
  it 's quite interesting that this country-city difference exists in nearly all nations , munich and bavaria is like houston and texas \u00b4 . 
   if your goverment said `` come on in ! '' ? 
  / =  they have been coming because your goverment have been offering them money and homes for years now . 
  also austrias refugee camp was recently criticized by ai for being inhumane , definitely not that great . 
  hungary is not in europe ? 
  they did n't all just pack up and come last week . 
  sure but that has nothing to do with the subject of europe being flooded by people that were uprooted directly or indirectly by the us . 
  or are we doing funfacts ? 
  did you know that butterflies have taste buds on their feet ? 
   really ? 
  when you say that they can not be a country on their own what else can you possibly mean ? 
  as stated above that all the points he mentioned were not some evil overlords plan to destroy sweet innocent but also perfect greece like the average greek redditor likes to claim but that there were reasons for it . 
  mhm that was exactly what i was saying ... ^ ^ ^ ^ / s, 
  you conveniently forget to add that greece was and is unable to be a country on their own and that having destroyers is pretty useless when your `` enemy '' is refugees and not a fleet of another country . 
  but sure that way it sounds more like evil-europe is plotting once more against poor old greece because they just hate them for being so great . 
  they started to flood in before that , she said that after hungary already had huge numbers in their country . 
  that is why i wrote `` you do n't understand how this works here . 
  you do n't read the articles posted '', 
  arguably once they leave a safe country ( turkey ) for a richer country ( germany ) they can be seen as that . 
  you do n't understand how this works here . 
  you do n't read the articles posted you simply claim that stuff had been said or done that makes you sound right and downvote everyone else . 
  merkel said that everyone that comes to germany gets a house , a mercedes and 100k a year and that is what / r/europe chose to believe . 
  also the refugees are stupid because they did n't fact check in the internet . 
   the crisis is a european problem right ? 
  yes it is , but it is a problem partly made by the us who has been playing war in that region for ages now . 
  that is a very different tune than what you were playing in your first post . 
  always nice to see that way below petty there is still being greek . 
  it is nice to have some things that do n't change even in turbulent times like these . 
  why so butthurt ? 
  so if some guy migrated from syria to let 's say the uk in the early 90s and lived there ever since he now turned magically into a refugee ? 
  good logic . 
  arabella 2005 never forget, 
  flaming and being childish assholes in cs : go . 
   or you know create a new british-wide top flight that both premier league and premiership promotes to , whatever sounds better to you . 
  naming would be quite difficult . 
  premier premier league ? 
  what is celtic 's situation ? 
  transportation and storage are not free , in fact storage can be so expensive that a product even when sold is a loss . 
  they are free to do so but not free of the consequences . 
  other farmers produce . 
  same context : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odjbbkgvt4q, 
  unfortunately we have plenty of people like heap42 who ca n't deal with the reality of other opinions existing . 
  you created isis and funded the rebels , the only one someone could argue is more responsible is assad himself . 
  and now is the time you decided that you won ? 
  not one of the many many short declines before that also meant nothing ? 
  good for you i guess . 
   the us is also 3x-4x farther away from syria than any european nation , so it stands to reason that we should n't be as invested . 
  this is happening on your doorstep , and therefore it 's in your immediate interest to help out . 
  the us is doing it because it 's in their general interest to avoid instability the us is directly responsible for what is happening . 
  what the actual fuck . 
  when was that taken ? 
  please say 1945 . 
  everyone from the general region can claim that they are from syria or just buy syrian papers . 
   germany made this statement that they would take people in because someone had to take pressure off italy and greece before the situation there got too bad . 
  it should be very obvious that this increases the pressure on the border countries . 
  germany made this statement because merkel thought it would be the more popular statement than `` no you ca n't come '' . 
  simple as that , it is about a few points in the next election .

  if you do n't really have any relevance in foreign politics it does n't really matter . 
  a dog could be our foreign minister for all i care . 
  so that 's why there were no wars to push the back and retake hungary and the balkans ... oh wait . 
  that actually makes sense . 
  if you need to explain someone where estonia is they wo n't know where latvia is and russia is rather big so it is n't really precise . 
   the technology is probably quite outdated at this point and parts do deteriorate , especially out in space . 
  so will iss2 .0 come with touchscreens and an app store ? 
  i think we win this one , the top submission in / r/austria is [ this ] ( https://i.imgur.com/sxcd9xr.jpg ) for obvious reasons .

  yeah about that ... [ 1 ] ( http://kurier.at/chronik/niederoesterreich/zwettl-kaenguru-paerchen-mit-baby-gesucht/9.367.648 ) [ 2 ] ( http://ooe.orf.at/news/stories/2691867/ ) [ 3 ] ( http://www.krone.at/themen/kaenguru-thema-778075 ), 
  so you guys just do n't drink outside in the summer or what are the alternatives ? 
  to fine germans . 
   same reason why only the government can sell alcohol outside of bars and clubs yeah that is just to make money . 
  depends on what . 
  some stuff is great , some is not , some is really shitty .

   we are not being brigaded though , perish the tought . 
  to me this looks more like you proved that banning is useless . 
  which it is , all it does is making it more difficult to tag the extrem cases . 
  the mods on / r/europe love to ban and delete , and i assume these are just the new accs . 
  of banned users . 
  some are smarter and make themselves a bunch at the same time so later when they are banned again they have a acc that is a few month old and some are not smart enough for that . 
  that is really surprising ... 
  thanks for taking the time to answer . 
  what is your personal opinion on hartz iv ? 
  i wa n't confused how to pronounce vodka until now . 
  thanks . 
  fucking india . 
  but at least you could steal their cuisine and throw your stuff in the garbage . 
  that is former royalty . 
  like the habsburg . 
  seriously that is the ultimate grandma look . 
  that is easily explained and , as always , it is the germans fault . 
  austrians are ethnically germans , so are swiss germans or south tyrolians , lichtensteiner and some remains of minority groups in other countries , hell might as well throw the dutch into the pot , they are just germans that ca n't spell `` deutsch '' .
