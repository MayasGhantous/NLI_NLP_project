  with them out of the equation belgium really is n't that outstanding anymore , not saying that you wo n't find a decent beer there but i never understood the popularity . 
  maybe it 's beer for people that actually would prefer something other , would explain the whole beer with flavors added thing that they have going on . 
  because the weird obsession in the bundesl\u00e4nder about how much better they are than vienna is so attractive ? 
   i did n't mean to offend , you obviously did , ** go fuck yourself ** and have a nice day . 
  ** come back if you want to have a civil discussion ** . 
  as if that would be possible with you . 
   alright then , you are just a prick . 
  stop crying so much over getting an similar worded answer like your original post . 
   and you completely missed the point with your ` answer ' no i told you that your `` point '' is unimportant . 
  fact is they have the tanks and they would receive the tanks anyway . 
  in this case it is better to sell them yourselves because the only thing you can influence is if you yourself make the sale not if they receive what they want . 
   there was probably a reason the indonesians choose the dutch over the german leopards . 
  it could have been money , it could have been additional deals , it could have been strengthening the relations , whatever it was , the deal got worse for the indonesians the moment nl declined . 
  otherwise they would n't have chosen the deal in the first place . 
  does n't matter . 
   it would have been better if germany declined to sell too . 
  then it would have made some impact . 
  and like i said they did n't so all that happened is that the dutch are down a few millions . 
  great job . 
   do n't you think the politicians ` thought really hard about it ' ? 
  obviously not or they would n't have decided that it is better for their neighbor to make the deal . 
   my point is , why on earth did you even bother to post that comment ? 
  because it is greatly amusing how offended you are from a 2 sentence answer that is in the same tone as your original post . 
   it is a simple ( and rude , maybe even stupid ) ` answer ' to a rather complex problem . 
  the answer is simple because the important part is that simple . 
  domestic politics and patting each other on the back , maybe even jerking each other off a little bit about how great you protected some human rights is really unimportant here , the facts stay the same indonesia has what it wants and all the dutch achieved is that they got nothing . 
  if germany declined there would be another country and even if it would have been another model of tank modern weaponry is pretty close to each other so it still does n't matter . 
   maybe you did n't mean to , but you came across like a prick . 
  i did mean it because it is an answer to :  turns out our lovely german neighbours did n't have so much problems with the deal your examples are n't the same because even 1 % less pollution is 1 % less . 
  while buying 100 tanks from x or y does n't change how many tanks you bought . 
   turns out our lovely german neighbours did n't have so much problems with the deal , so they sold theirs . 
  think really hard and maybe you can figure out why that makes sense . 
  there will always be someone selling might as well be you . 
   and they own 3 houses , nice german cars and travel abroad frequently wtf ... 
  believe me when i say that not sending the austrian army to your aid is assisting you . 
  [ also we are already involved in something that takes up both of our soldiers . 
   russian leadership can keep telling themselves that 's not the point , they need to keep telling it to their population . 
  nothing better than a nice dose of nationalism is your life is shit . 
   is n't one of fpo 's goals a re-unification with germany ? 
  no it is not . 
  i am not a fan of whataboutism . 
   show me a sharia law erdogan passed last 13 years he was running the country , headscarfs in schools and further restriction of alcohol ? 
  * was, 
   okay , japan is safe but it 's not utopia . 
  shit gets stolen , people do n't just leave bikes unlocked at train stations with no worry . 
  they even do/did that in copenhagen last time i was there . 
   i also ask that you do not use any taxis as a form of protest how would i leave the airport ? 
  better than expected . 
  they probably saw a football game of your national team . 
  i too sometimes wonder why italy 's finest seem to die from someone walking past them . 
  that is not what he said . 
  that every popular online game is plagued with eastern european kids and the french , who are essentially the eastern european kids of western europe . 
  is n't belarus entirely that one tank game ? 
   i understand how it can be confusing , i understand transsexual people and gay folks much better , putting them in the same basket as the attention whores is n't really a favor . 
  is n't that why belgium was invented ? 
  the actual looks like they bought it at ikea , and probably cost bunch of millions.l, 
  ofc nobody is working in the austrian parliament ... 
  for a very short moment i was thinking the unthinkable `` hey maybe the germans are n't that bad '' but thanks to your comment my world is fine again . 
   a-h was maybe good for austria , hungary , balkan countries , but not for czech lands . 
  yeah i am sure it was hard being the industrial center of an empire ... 
  for starters muslim is not a race . 
  that 's already our name !, 
  the mighty austrian navy would have no problem securing the greek islands !, 
  that 's a great analogy . 
  makes me as an outsider understand the issue better , thanks !, 
  do they claim he was a slav or do they claim he was a macedonian and that they are macedonians ... there is a difference you know . 
  what about the hre ? 
   the problem for greeks is n't the name on its own . 
  the problem is the false historical argument on which the claim of the name is based . 
  i never understood this . 
  italians do n't seem to be offended by anything roman displayed outside of rome . 
  maybe they were bitching like crazy about the hre and nobody wrote it down ... who knows . 
  they were invited to the earlier meeting and made clear they are not interested in any progress on that matter , so they were not invited to the follow up meeting . 
   you guys should take them because you invited them , stop making things up . 
  ah yes , austria should accept that hundreds of thousands of refugees are stuck in austria while everyone else turns a blind eye ? 
  disgusting lack of solidarity , and if this is the future of eu then it can go f *** itself . 
  since this is essentially the counter strategy it should be at least understandable why parts of austria 's government act the way they do . 
  [ austria only borders other schengen countries ] ( https://www.axa-schengen.com/sites/default/files/schengen_map_en.gif ) . 
  also part of this conference was sending support to other countries if needed ( like macedonia ) . 
   germany ca n't make that recommendation because it violates the dublin agreement . 
  first country where they present is the country where they must be processed . 
  that does n't happen , an agreement that is not enforced is worthless . 
  i rather say if germany starts to refuse all of them , and this is a very possible if ( maybe the next k\u00f6lner silvesternacht is the fukushima of the refugee crisis ... ) , then the prefered solution for austria is to not be completely flooded by the now stranded refugees . 
  i find it extremely weird that germany actually expects austria and all the other countries on the balkan route to subdue themselves to german internal politics . 
   we are reaching the ` fuck you , i do what i want stage ' of europe , germanys stance on this whole thing is austria is not allowed to simply let them all through to germany , austria is not allowed to keep them outside of its borders and austria is not allowed to back the other countries on the route . 
  there is simply no way to deal with this situation without telling germany to go fuck itself because they are against every single option . 
  read the comment again . 
  if no airplane carrier takes you , you wont go by plane . 
  airline carriers do n't take you without a visa or something comparable , that 's because if the passenger is not granted his refugee status they have to pay for his deportation . 
   my argument is that when the southern states do it it 's made a huge deal but wheb it 's austria or germany not so much . 
  it 's the application of double standards that gets me . 
  that 's what i am referring to . 
  might would have been better to include it in the quote . 
  all i am saying is that in terms of double standards , especially when we are talking about the refugee crisis france should n't be to loud . 
   good luck convincing the relevant court that asylum seekers who were apprehended in freilassing ( on the austrian border ) entered germany via a country that is not austria . 
  it is impossible for austria to be the first eu country a refugee entered . 
   my argument is that when the southern states do it it 's made a huge deal but wheb it 's austria or germany not so much . 
  you mean like introducing refugee quotas ? 
  oh no wait austria is getting shit on for that while france did the exactly same thing and nobody raised an eyebrow . 
  only difference is austria 's is for its size way more generous .
