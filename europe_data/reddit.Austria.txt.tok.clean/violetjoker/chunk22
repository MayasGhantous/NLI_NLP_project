   with the austrian ones , just by looking at the logo i would n't be as a austrian you know the relevant logos . 
  it 's not that the sport guys write you letters that often . 
  `` frauen gesundheit '' does n't mean `` health of women '' it is `` health and women '' , a few of the ministries are set up that way . 
  also ofc there is ministry for men . 
  it is the defense ministry , that 's what we are there for anyway !, 
  they are called `` women '', 
   i will never understand where all this clinton fearmongering came from . 
  what so hard to understand ? 
  while it in no ways makes trump any better , clinton was known for supporting pretty much every military operation . 
  germans too , in their case just a different kind of weak . 
   quasi-fascist i already accepted ( somewhat ) that after socialism and communism americans will now misuse fascism and nazi until the words are useless . 
  but seeing it from a german is kinda sad . 
  sweden is such a dick ... someone should set him straight . 
  where is denmark when you need him ? 
  hat ich im ursprungspost schon erkl\u00e4rt  it is kinda why this will never work , someone will always get the short end , or at least think they do . 
  alrighty then , so why does a rich country like austria get off easy compared to bulgaria since the additional costs are a lot harder to stem for a country with a smaller economy . 
  i want my money back !, 
  in your fantasy distribution , why the hell does austria , a country of 8mio get 33 % more than bulgaria ( 7mio ) , same as romania ( 20mio ) and about half of germany who have ten times the population . 
  latvia and lithuania also get fucked . 
  it is kinda why this will never work , someone will always get the short end , or at least think they do . 
  i climbed that in assassins creed . 
  i think . 
   as the sun never setting that comes from the spanish empire . 
  literally habsburg . 
  sorry guys we tried . 
  a for attendance ? 
  `` mehr an russland orientieren '' is n't nearly as strong as `` amerika zugest\u00e4ndnisse machen '' . 
  would be more interesting if they asked `` russland zugest\u00e4ndnisse machen '' instead . 
  also if i found the right youtube channel he has less than 10000 views and a little more than 200 followers there . 
  [ here is the `` gps version '' , ] ( http://orbis.stanford.edu/ ) plots you either the fastest/cheapest or shortest way from a to b and tells you how long it would have taken you . 
  huh ? 
  why 's that ? 
  do they hate the name or something ? 
  if it helps you , i would n't take arms for germany . 
  we will gladly take m\u00e4hren back !, 
  i think '' \u00d6sterreichts '' is great , but it will never become the established name because only germans will understand it . 
  do n't talk to me or my umlaute ever again !, 
  \u00d6xit is the only one i saw actually used . 
  that 's because i am criticizing him , the person , and say that he should n't get any attention . 
  i never intended to start an argument about this particular interview . 
   i understand that you have no understand of the situation and what happens there . 
  just the assumption that i think that the eu sent down wagons with all the cash shows that you do n't understand much . 
   so , the credability bullshit is just for internal consumption but you are right i do n't understand that sentence , i think it 's a language barrier issue though . 
  his credibility/authenticity/trustworthiness suffered immensely when he decided to run with this populist party , and he ca n't claim to have done it `` for the greater good '' either because he did n't do shit . 
  next thing you want me to take the fp\u00d6 serious in questions of moral . 
   plus all the terror attacked and and isis taining jihadis to pretend to be refugees , people do n't feel safe . 
  well you can blame that on the uk and not the eu . 
   oh god ... let 's stop here . 
  you are talking like schaeuble 's mouthpiece . 
  these are political bullshits . 
  well yeah it 's not like you provided anything to continue with anyway . 
  well i think it is save to say that trump is truest to the title `` prince of orange '' anyway . 
   if i wanted the program to continue because i ve invested so much political power in it , i would n't talk to him either . 
  the gov. 
  of all these countries were losing their voters , the claim that they did n't even wanted to continue to talk hurt them even more , until it was rebutted . 
  also interesting that you ignored that he run with syriza , that alone takes away any credibility . 
   oh well ... you have to start giving arguments otherwise you seem like a clown why ? 
  dude threw a tantrum and stepped down blaming foreign ministers would n't talk to him ( obviously a lie ) and you defend him for not being a clown . 
  seems like just not arguing is still better than lying . 
  at least to me . 
  edit :  apart from his resume and his numerous publications etc that obviously do n't matter to you the resume becomes worthless by actions . 
  like running for syriza . 
  he is . 
  once you ruined your reputation everything you say is clowny , because you are a clown . 
  why does that clown still get attention ? 
  the sad thing is the 2nd guy from the left is probably significantly taller than i am . . 
  but that 's just a krapfen . 
  why ?

  every country in europe has a traditional pea soup . 
  i think it 's an `` emperor 's new clothes '' meme . 
  never knew you guys were such fans , but it makes sense i guess . 
  that 's art . 
  who 's that ? 
  monopoly in the hipster/bobo market . 
   next we 'll start taking about how all american beer are piss water . 
  oh you want to start the `` americans invented small breweries in 2005 circlejerk '' ? 
  did n't you also move from one of the poorest countries in western europe to one with the highest ppp ? 
  2 out of 3 bananas include parts of austria . 
  maybe that 's why we are such a banana republic ... 
  yeah fuck privacy !, 
  what a bunch of cunts we are . 
  do you know a good documentary about that ? 
  or an article , seems mind blowing that this happened in ireland in the 80s and i have never heard about it till now . 
  does n't normally the family of the woman pay the dowry ? 
  and does n't the husband receive the dowry essentially as payment for taking care of the woman in the future or said nicer as a little starting money for the new family ? 
  you tried to explain to her to not have prejudices with the most prejudice example you could come up with ? 
   but there you are , emotions sometimes get the better of our reason . 
  it would be worse in xy if the people in question were neo-nazis , is n't the best reason to be honest . 
  sounds like raf just aimed for the city and the us airforce already bombed messerschmitt . 
  [  in a final big week mission \\ ( # 235 \\ ) , the eighth air force bombed the augsburg messerschmitt works during the day on 25 february 1944 . 
  that night \\ ( 25/26 february 1944 \\ ) , raf bomber command followed with 594 aircraft and destroyed large parts of the centre of augsburg .

  thanks !, 
  could someone explain the `` no guns/guns '' to me please ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  they do . 
  austria is in a kinda bad spot with transit/through traffic , but the president is n't an active role in the government so he does n't play a role in dealing with that issue . 
  `` europhile '' what a stupid word . 
  in austria the greens are n't really a party with a focus on environmental problems anymore , depending on your pov the greens either abandoned their roots or succeed since other parties picked up the topic too .
