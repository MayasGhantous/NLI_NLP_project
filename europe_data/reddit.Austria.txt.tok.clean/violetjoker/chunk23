  they moved on and are more of a urban left wing party with the typical stances , the environment being one topic of many with somewhat equal importance . 
   will the new president be able to do anything about it now ? 
  no the president does n't play a role in that . 
   unfortunate circumstances , what a nice way to describe trusting german efficiency . 
   thaler -  daler -  dollar that 's a direct line . 
  it 's just an additional step added , and for whatever reason you small patriotic heart ca n't handle it . 
  the claim is simply thaler -  daler -  dollar , nothing to freak out over buddy . 
  `` i love a hot chocolate on a cold winter morning , thank god for cows '' `` hot chocolate is made by mixing milk and cocoa , cows are n't involved '', 
   no , the germans have nothing to do with it . 
  the dutch name comes from the german word taler . 
  it is the source of the name . 
  but / r/de is for all dach countries . 
  at least they claim they are . 
   pis is just pandering to their hardcore base , creating an enemy that they can blame all their shortcomings on and the reason why poland is not great again . 
  why the eu though ? 
  russia seems like such a more obvious target , i do n't think i have ever met a pole that did n't dislike russia . 
  [ always kinda ] ( http://assets.cantbeunseen.com/hashed_silo_content/silo_content/33447/resized/akoh-america-is-gay.jpg ), 
   many think it looks cool , but that 's the equivalent of the nazi germany flag in asia ... 
  since it is still in use and was a lot older the comparison is somewhat uneven . 
   first canadian place you guys need to step up your name game . 
  jeeeze if only they had your insight 2015 . 
  everything could have been avoided !, 
  g'sunde watschn probably . 
   i do believe that this should not escalate on austrian side as well and our election are coming up too . 
  this is what i am worried about . 
  i believe that moving the troops is fine and within every right of austria , i also believe that it is done to show the people that the government is not the unprepared mess they were in 2015 and not out of necessity . 
  the defense minister is from the social democrats , the other traditionally big party , the peoples party already changed their stance on this issue dramatically after they switched leaders . 
  if this escalates and the social democrats might fear that they will lose votes if they try to iron out the issues and look `` weak '' this could turn ugly . 
  ( with `` ugly '' i obviously do n't mean war or something like that , just a lot of bruised egos and bad blood between 2 neighbors for years to come ), 
   not if your borders are all mountains like you guys have , you can technically swim from france to the uk , you definitely do n't need a boat fit for the high sea , yet people are piling up on frances northern coast . 
  why ? 
   speak to russians currently a neighbor i always thought quite fondly of pretending that moving troops within the own border is an act of aggression worries me more than the russians . 
   we italians are just being decent human beings ... you act as if we were a client state of yours . 
   you know why we hate the fact that you moved your army to our border . 
  because it would be an issue for you sending up immigrants against every treaty you ever signed ? 
   hard to secure borders when your borders are fucking coasts . 
  it actually the other way round , coasts are easier to protect . 
  you know because we are born with legs instead of boats down there . 
  austrian in october . 
  this has the potential to actually escalate . 
  that is probably why the wrote about four `` pandur armoured personnel carriers '', 
  sure . 
  and you know that this is not an answer to the question . 
  was it just an empty threat ? 
  a source of hilarity some might say . 
   eu army there , since you guys hate the fact that austria is allowed to move austrian troops within austria i feel like a shared army is a few generations away . 
   it 's good to see europe solidarity for the problems of every member state , when yeah italians crying that deploying troops within austria is essentially an act of war really makes me go `` damn solidarity at its finest '' . 
   they know perfectly well that we will retaliate how ? 
  by banning austrians from giving you money in the next summer ? 
  croatia will be thankful . 
  but you demonstrate why there is no `` real solution '' or `` working together '' . 
  you guys also have a really flattering thread in r/italy . 
   what is stopping them from going through switzerland switzerland would probably , if not and it happens in an amount that austrian politicians actually feel threatened ( to lose votes ) than probably austria in a year or so . 
   in italy , is seen as `` flexing muscles '' and the public response is , already in the last few hours , really harsh , yeah it is really obvious that italy does not see austria as a real country that is allowed to do anything . 
  really makes you think . 
  with the election upcoming , if this is escalated further by italy it actually could harm the countries relations for quite some time . 
  dark red -  light brown is a weird transition though . 
  western tech group in eu4 , that is all that matters , 
  who is what ? 
   implies that y start the war or the provocations that lead to the war no it does not . 
  also this obviously changes for every single war if you change your pov . 
   it was actually the other way around . 
  how is that `` the other way around '' . 
  being at war is a two way thing , nobody said that they declared the war . 
  serbia is one of the very few countries that was at war with nato . 
  not really rocket science to guess where op is coming from . 
   what am i , an american ? 
  i assume he is talking about house shoes , like birkenstock . 
   i think they 're like a quarter of our economy what is the economy of michigan like ? 
  all i ever hear of mi is flint and detroit . 
   he 's quite handsome too .

   copying the fp\u00d6 rethoric ? 
  he does n't , you are n't populist just by being not left or picking up talking points from the fp\u00d6 . 
  fp\u00d6 rethoric is more like that : [ patriotism instead of moroccan thieves !,

  wiener blut - viennese blood has an explanation ) but it is pretty bad . 
  ( they also all rhyme in german ), 
   i believe that eu should aim for a fair deal with uk . 
  this does n't mean that uk should receive a special treatment judging by what i have heard so far `` a fair deal '' would be considered `` punishing out of spite and envy '' by the uk . 
  everything but the extremest special treatment will be considered a punishment and pushed as that by politicians and media . 
  but if you read an argument you still have `` heard that argument before '' . 
  that `` argument '' was on reddit pretty much every day for a few months .

  even if the image of him as a `` seasoned diplomat that at least wont embarrass austria '' is now damaged i do n't regret my vote considering the options that made it to the 2nd round . 
  really ? 
  now that is interesting , i remember that as a kid my grandfather in styria always drove to slovenia to fill up the car of every visiting family member . 
  did you guys have a massive price spike ? 
  you just reminded me that i bought that book years ago and never read it . 
  thanks for that !, 
   but hey , every german is a piefke , right ? 
  yes because that 's what the word means , the german usage as `` kleinb\u00fcrgerlich / spie\u00dfig '' does n't really exist in austria . 
  every german is a piefke just as every austrian is a \u00d6si . 
  do you really think there is cultural closeness between hamburg and some alpine village ? 
  honest question , while i agree that we are growing closer probably because of the `` common market for cultural products '' i just do n't see it . 
  i find it interesting that people think the discussion started recently . 
  the bus and final campaigning is an easy target in order to make fun of them , and the stay campaign is rightfully criticized but the eu was since thatcher the scapegoat for many problems and issues . 
  that is decades of anti-eu `` propaganda '' to build on , way more than a bus could ever achieve . 
  you sent them by horse courier did n't you ? 
  that 's not old , to the vast majority of reddit 30 is old .
