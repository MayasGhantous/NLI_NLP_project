  #  well , that and being compared to nk . 
  i think that 's a tad hyperbolic i assume that was the point . 
  but it is still worth pointing out that it comes across like that . 
  i 've spent my fair share of time in the us i 've been in california , new york and jersey , illinois and several states in the midwest ( or what i think the midwest is ( everything between california and ny ) ) so i do n't think i have a very narrow view here . 
  stuff like the pledge of allegiance are so outstanding because the only thing that come to mind that are similar here in austria are 3 . reich related . 
  if the austrian morning show guy would call us `` the greatest country on earth '' he would lose his job for that . 
  the only thing is more bewildering is the influence of religion on daily live i experienced in some parts , which is astonishing if you consider how backwards austria is in that regard . 
  the idea of you guys being brainwashed comes back nearly every day , something or someone will remind a visitor that the patriotism is taken to the next level there . 
  it 's a feeling that is always present . 
  reddit does n't help here at all but lets leave that one out for now . 
  was at a school football match in the us at a field that was ( i assume ) on school grounds . 
  they sang the anthem . 
  so where i get that ? 
  the us . 
  you ca n't make exceptions just because only then your argument fits . 
   how about we call out germany for torpedoing the european recovery by imposing draconian fiscal targets and refusing to budge on implementing more exotic monetary tools to help reduce unemployment ? 
  happens every day on this sub . 
  so what exactly is your point besides a little burning in the butt-area because the world is n't waving your favorite flag ? 
   the differences between california , texas , and mississippi ( for example ) are absolutely massive lol no . 
  the differences exist but that 's about it . 
  great point , thanks for sharing . 
  how else would you form an opinion ? 
  in order to have an opinion on us politics i have to work in the white house ? 
  in order to have an opinion on deforestation of the amazon i have to live in a hut there ? 
  you found an really easy and comfortable way to belittle everyone with a different opinion than yours did n't you ? 
  `` informing myself '' `` being a source '' try again . 
  you do n't have the distinction between a robber and a thief in the us ? 
  a robber robs you with either the use of violence or at least threatening a thief steals without direct interaction . 
  robbing nets you a higher sentence . 
  also you apparently did n't even understand my post which is a shame considering that you could have learned something . 
  i doubt that a white kid from a rich suburb in the us has more insight than a white kid from europe . 
  both have pretty much the same connection to ferguson . 
  how does being from another country hinder me to informing myself ? 
  that is nice but he was n't shot because he robbed a store . 
  the thing is if you just robbed a store and then get pulled over you probably react differently , more aggressive and these actions could validate being shot in self defence . 
  considering that you thought it is necessary for your argument to lie and call him a thief instead a violent robber shows that deep down you know that your argument is bullshit . 
  also stop insulting lederhosen . 
  food does n't qualify as `` unexpected expenses '', 
  where in europe are people starving ? 
  so what about countries that already have states ? 
  can we have states within states ? 
  and how can i trust that `` larger issues '' handled by for example the british are n't handled in extreme favor of said country like the british would without a doubt do ? 
  installing something like that is easier when you do it on newly discovered dirt not on people that have a national identity . 
   austria-hungary , one of the most powerful empires on the planet would fall 50 years later , never to rise again ? 
  we will see about that !, 
  `` machinery and electronics '' could have just written `` stuff '' and saved some space . 
  buying illegal wood from russia helps . 
  since you do n't even understand a 1 sentence post i highly doubt you `` know how to read '' . 
  [ learning to read . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/learning_to_read ), 
  i already gave an explanation what my issues with christiana are . 
  just assuming that my problem was me being a douche is pretty douchey itself . 
  it is basically a 68-themepark with overpriced but inferior drugs . 
  just a shoutout for all the high travelers out there . 
  christiana is a real disappointment !, 
   sequence by arne quinze in front of it i 'm sorry mr.silverionmox it appears that your city has cancer . 
  are they burning their own flag or are these brits ? 
  so you want to reintroduce serfdom ? 
  nope : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/budget_of_the_european_union#net_contributors_and_recipients, 
  considering that gas and baddies go hand in hand ( damn norwegians ! ), 
  the best plan would be having at least the option to switch who you give the majority of your money . 
  binding the baddies to you instead of binding yourself to one baddie . 
  you buy gas from iran and the rest of the middle east , and shut down the gas pipelines from russia . 
  after the first economic hit you reopen negotiations . 
  another time not being mentioned at all !, 
  pay normal rates and get represented normal . 
  what makes you so much better that although `` you got your money back '' you get to also lead the pack ? 
  yeah the eu is known for paying low wages !, 
  and us and mexico are a shining example of how you should treat your neighbors !, 
   it seems like a small thing , but it could contribute to a mindset that europe is lead by an ungrateful ally and a former enemy that never really saw britain as ` one of us ! ', 
  to begin with . 
  that 's a lot to ask for if you view yourself as that superior and have no problems reminding everyone about it all the time . 
  they have the best conditions in the eu . 
  pay a lot less than others or what they should and could get all the benefits that you have for being in the eu if they chose so . 
  really that socialist crap flies to in the uk . 
  thought that was an us exclusive thing ... 
  so having the iaea in vienna makes austria an atomic super power ? 
  god ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ getting ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ turned ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ on ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ half ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ mast . 
  the germans build them so they can have fun in the summer . 
  no , again , my comment was that it is not hypocrisy because they never stated anything for non eu members . 
  just because they said `` we will defend the integrity of eu members '' does not mean they will or will not defend the integrity of non eu members . 
  considering that you are from serbia i assume that this is a somewhat personal issue for you but there was simply no statement about non eu members . 
  i 'd say the only thing the kosovo , montenegro and ukraine proves is that for the german government they judge these independence movements case to case . 
  and i 'll be honest with you , i doubt that they judge them by `` what the people want '' but by what is the best scenario for them and to some lesser extend the eu . 
  that 's the weirdest logic ever . 
  ukraine is not an eu member . 
  that 's a completely new discussion . 
  they said '' all of eu member states '' you said `` they already broke this with the kosovo '' , serbia is not a member of the eu and that 's why they did n't break anything . 
  that is really all i 'm trying to explain to you , i never argued for or against that statement . 
  i ... ahm ... kinda keep forgetting that moldova exists . 
  it 's already in bold letters , what more do you need to understand the 2 simple words `` member states '', 
  `` we ( the german government ) defend the territorial integrity of ** all of ( european union ) member states ** '', 
  serbia is not in the eu and the quote is `` we ( the german government ) defend the territorial integrity of all of ( european union ) member states '', 
  `` fr\u00fcher war alles besser '' ( `` everything was better in the old days '' ) is a strong emotion nearly everywhere if the old days did n't suck extremely bad ( and for some even if they did ) . 
  really meeting a foreign leader is bad ? 
  you 'd think that even if there is only a slim chance to end a dispute with words you should go for it . 
  what good will come from cutting all lines of communication ? 
  but the important question is also from your fathers fathers fathers fathers ? 
  as far as i remember they can even freeze the accounts of a dane buying cigars from germany so `` only the us '' does n't really exist . 
  did n't work in cuba .
