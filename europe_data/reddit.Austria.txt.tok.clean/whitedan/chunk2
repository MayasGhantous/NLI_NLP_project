  lets close our eyes and ignore what erdpig does . 
  tragedy ... and now let me guess ... eu wants to tighten gun laws again and abuse the shit out of this tragedy . 
  wtf you talking about ? 
  triest is ours . 
  on a scale of 0 to 10 ( 10 means most `` deeply penetrated '' ) , how deeply penetrated are the eu countries ? 
  hah ... that will show them !, 
  `` we have to find a name for it ... a cool one ! '', 
  `` how about vergeltungswaffe ! '', 
  `` no , thats taken . '', 
  `` ok how about jet cum rocket ? '', 
  `` perfect . '', 
  you have poorly educated already integrated migrants that do those jobs , now more come and want those jobs too . 
  so europe needs a migrant arena !, 
  you mean so that we need another genocide ? 
  not later but wrong . 
  i anticipate the recoil of my rifle cause i shouldered it wrong at the beginning . 
  now i have to relearn not to flinch when i pull the trigger . 
  if i could have that in austria too x ( had to wait till i am 18 to use my first rifle and now i developed a bad habit because i wasnt trained early on . 
  would also be useful for securing boarders . 
  i thought the eastern part of ukraine is the non warzone part ? 
   yea but talking about and actually doing so is something different, 
   yea but talking about and actually doing so is something different, 
  yea but talking about and actually doing so is something different, 
  for the size of our country we got more than enough , though many who seek asylum are still travelling towards the north ( germany and sweden , etc ), 
  economic direction all the way . 
  if we dont need something , its a eu parliament that orders his member states what to do . 
  this would result in political tension and could ultimately lead to more shit like brexit . 
  well probably because of mass immigration which results in more cultural ( and economical ) problems ( seeing as we have random clashes already in vienna ) ( also our ex-eastern european migrants are probably doing already the jobs that many new refugees can do , so we probably get a higher unemployment rate too ) lack of integration is a problem too , most of the eastern europeans and asians do well but especially with the middle easteners you often get problems . 
  not all are problematic but it seems you are more likely to find an idiot from there . 
  example given : a colleague of mine ( middle eastern origin ) discussed how the zionist jews are problematic for the world and are the starters of the middle eastern destabilisation . 
  another one complained how dumb the others in his place are and that they are highly religious , this guy is really cool and smart . 
  problem here is that both are moderate moslems , while the last one is probably closer to a atheist , the other one is still religious and kinda stupid . 
  another example is a former school mate who never talked to our female teacher , he could talk german though , it was just that he was one of those special ones that `` dont have to talk to woman because woman have to obey man '' this are all just examples of why i support a more right view on the debate , but many people experience stuff like this too . 
  on hofer : hofer is considered a center right politician and because of all the recent headlines and experiences people like me tend to vote for him instead for someone who is looking like a puppet of the eu , and who wants to continue the `` welcome policy '' . 
  if there is a referendum its not that bad , likely nobody would want to leave the eu here since we are one of the countries who profit the most of it . 
  but at least it gives the people a way to get involved more in politics . 
  and a socialist . 
  dont forget that . 
  he basically was the worst of both . 
  yea i mean if being oppressed and liking it is the new feminism , i am sure they will find enough middle aged man that will oppress them because of their religious believes . 
  first rule of danland , nobody talks about danland . 
  well i have to say that this time the fp\u00f6 might not be trying to get out of the eu , with all the crap that happens right now in britain they would risk losing voters and as a populistic party they dont want that . 
  well they had problems with elections earlier already ... bush i think was kinda involved . 
  yea . . well ... keep waiting . 
  i dont think that , i simply misinterpreted the meaning of the title . 
  shouldnt be like that though . 
  turkey right now is at least as bad as russia . 
  yea i thought opposes a second referendum means to want another one but its the opposite . 
  yea i just find it funny that all are suddenly against leave ... thats like saying you want a steak in a restaurant and when you get your steak you blame the waiter for not bringing you salad instead . 
  ~ ~ yea ~ ~ ~ ~ too ~ ~ ~ ~ bad ~ ~ ~ ~ you ~ ~ ~ ~ already ~ ~ ~ ~ got ~ ~ ~ ~ your ~ ~ ~ ~ referendum ~ ~ ~ ~ , ~ ~ ~ ~ sadly ~ ~ ~ ~ you ~ ~ ~ ~ guys ~ ~ ~ ~ were ~ ~ ~ ~ stupid ~ ~ ~ ~ enough ~ ~ ~ ~ to ~ ~ ~ ~ vote ~ ~ ~ ~ something ~ ~ ~ ~ you ~ ~ ~ ~ didnt ~ ~ ~ ~ want ~ ~ edit . 
  ups opposes means `` dont want '' . 
  funny how we cared not at all when is bombed russian air plane with some 100 people on board . 
  but they need to care for turkey because half their population is here . 
  suddenly the state doesnt need to pay cleaners anymore ... just always put some gay pride parades there . 
  * elderly radical christian extremists . 
  because you cant get guns illegaly or even legally in germany ? 
  they do ... he probably just wanted attention/suicide by cops , no need to get heavy equipment for that . 
  ah ok , does look beautiful though . 
  thermite used in bombs ? 
  can confirm , some of my mates go there , and my parents and my mates and parents are austria . 
  my cats breath smells like cat food so i avoid smelling its breath ... not like cat food is bad ... but its just not my taste . 
  so basically ... anti democratic then ? 
  wait ... he can have a different opinion than you ? 
  yea ... he must be the idiot here . 
  kinda funny ... what should it use them if they kill her ? 
  its basically a shot into their own knee ? 
  cancer is no joke , even in heaven . 
  i have to say ... a friend of mine is a turk living together with other turks in his district , he complains about how backwards conservative islamists the are . 
  their women are not working , they are just there for childmaking and to maintain the apartments , they live from states money . 
  then you got the kids who thanks to their backwards fundamentalist parents have bad education and magically join isis . 
  at the same time you can look at the majority of other immigrants that behave , work hard and live a modern life . 
  so how come that this special kind of people from the middle east cant integrate and adapt when others from more exotic countries can ? 
  you guys thought merkel got a spine ? 
  now ... thats a new argument i havent tought of . 
  and i really think that the current eu approach is wrong , its going into the direction : `` do what we want or bend over and let us probe you '' but actually national interests should be considered too otherwise you will up tension inside the member states !, 
  i mean ... how can they be bad if they are that kind ? 
  yea he is right ... cause one guy said it the whole party means that . 
  kinda funny how turkey can give the eu all the idiots and can keep the experienced workers . 
  that deal was top notch , for turkey . 
  but why ? 
  more migrants for greek means more money right ? 
  they boost the economy !, 
  just incase someone wonders : ^ / s, 
  yea but i was thinking more of the western countries , i cant imagine anyone here having the balls to face a threat . 
  you think anyone would do that today ? 
  like give their live for their people ? 
  austria has pretty relaxed laws , comparable to some us states . 
  we still dont have a gun problem . 
  + it was stated in many other articles that this changes were made because of the paris attacks . 
  nope , just this week someone killed himself by train again . 
  so basically if you dont want to wait 3 days to get a gun an a fast way to die you jump infront of a train and fck up the time shedule and annoy or traumatise all the people next to you . 
  the minister there from my nation was actually seen as representative of hunters and sport gunners , he voted for this crap law . 
  he kinda voted against the people that voted for his party to begin with . 
  look , i really believe those politicians arent dumb , so whats there real reason to do useless crap like that ? 
  is it to cater to the dumb anti gun masses with their irrational fear of legal gun owners ? 
  but that would mean to piss of 50 % + of your population . 
  i dont think thats the reason either . 
  so the only 2 possible reasons are : 1 . disarming citizens , that would mean they are trying to build a dictatorship ( democracy to the ass ) 2 . i am wrong and they are really just dumb . 
  paris terror guns : made illegal from gas guns ( less than lethal guns ) , to do this you need to change like the whole gun because the parts cant stand the strain . 
  so basically you have to make a new gun .
