  so has bulgaria . 
  my girlfriend 's mother was there last year and she loved it for all the reasons you named . 
  i 've only been to one place in croatia that was zadar . 
  i want to go again . 
  very small city but the best part are the islands . 
  the ferries are ridiculously cheap and there are all kinds of places to stay along the islands . 
  i 'm not much of the party type , but zadar and the islands had so many places to stay , plenty of places to jump into the water and relax and other outdoor activities . 
  not only that but every price category was there . 
  you could do it very cheaply or very expensive ( although even that was still quite cheap ) . 
  tanks are n't only transported by rail in the usa , but sometimes by road , too . 
  i was driving down i-75s in the us and saw a few semitrailers rolling up i-75n with abrams on their backs . 
  not just the italians . 
  my austrian father-in-law went there and got a whole new set of teeth for next to nothing . 
  if everyone has the same information , there is no leverage . 
  i do n't necessarily think an intelligence operative sits there , has two pieces of information and then weighs it like this : this nugget cost me a small bar tab and could save the world but this other nugget required a satellite orbiting the planet and will ruin the world - better decide for the satellite since it cost my agency several million but i never paid for it ... 
  the information is more valuable . 
  not necessarily the method with which it was gathered in terms of monetary cost . 
  what ... ? 
  open source intelligence ? 
  i 'm not entirely sure if you understand how the world works , much less what is to be understood under the term `` intelligence '' . 
  i 'm all for being idealistic , but there are limits . 
  you clearly misunderstand . 
  let me use an example : imagine that you are seated at a conference table with a country/government that you know absolutely nothing about . 
  in fact , we almost have this situation with north korea . 
  very little ( at least publicly ) is known about the regime or the people of the country in comparison to other states . 
  let 's keep it purely hypothetical , though . 
  now you 're sitting at this conference table and you have to negotiate over some important topic . 
  does n't matter what it is . 
  nuclear weapons , oil , electricity , the environment - the topic is irrelevant . 
  now because your country has absolutely * zero * espionage capabilities , you are essentially the blind man at the table while the other country has a fledgling espionage agency while the best your country 's diplomats have done is read a wikipedia article . 
  you have no idea what the other side wants , what they regard as cultural affronts , how their leaders think , what kind of economic situation they find themselves in - nothing . 
  you know essentially nothing . 
  now negotiate with them ... good luck . 
  i am merely speaking with regard to espionage in statecraft , specifically as a function of effective diplomacy . 
  no more , no less . 
  i think i made that abundantly clear in my initial comment and that all other forms of spying ( such as on private citizens ) is questionable at best if not outright illegal . 
  i believe it 's actually coming from his colleague janine gibson , if [ this comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/1nisdy/were_glenn_greenwald_and_janine_gibson_of_the/cciy06s ) from the ama is anything to go by . 
  i can only impart that which i have learned and gleaned through conversations with individuals from the intelligence community . 
  but let 's not be naive and think that they do n't . 
  just about every single country worth its stuff has some intelligence organization ( even tiny `` neutral '' austria ) and these organizations most certainly practice espionage . 
  hell , china is another large operator ( [ this book ] ( https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/b004ol2ni8/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title ) provides a very thorough overview ) . 
  do you think that information gathering does not take place at these summits ? 
  these are conferences for diplomats to maintain connections throughout the world and you can believe that they write foreign contact reports after the fact that are cataloged and filed away for the future . 
  edit : [ this book ] ( http://www.amazon.de/legacy-ashes-history-cia-ebook/dp/b0010sipz8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=utf8&amp;qid=1381417165&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=history+of+ashes ) provides a wonderful history of the cia . 
  also makes mention of espionage against the usa from the uk and other countries . 
  can we please stop being pissed off at countries spying on other countries ? 
  espionage is part of the diplomatic process . 
  information is power . 
  i think if you 're a member of the diplomatic corps , you should dispel any ideas that you are immune to espionage . 
  it is most definitely a problem if the nsa is performing unwarranted wiretaps on private citizens , but let 's be real : germany spies on england , england spies on the usa , germany spies on the usa and the usa spies on them back - even though they are * all * allies . 
  it pays to know what the person on the other side of the table is thinking . 
  if you have absolutely * no * insight into the mind of the other person , you have no way of successfully negotiating . 
  let 's cut the crap already , ok ? 
  i think his colleague was actually the lead author on that particular story , iirc from the ama . 
  yeah , but this is an entire city every single night for a few weeks . 
  millions upon millions of people . 
  understatement of the week right here , folks . 
  this is the kind of joke you laugh at and then think , `` i 'm a terrible human being ... '', 
  i imagine it has to do with the virus not having enough hosts to come into contact with . 
  it eventually hits this `` wall '' of vaccination , behind which live the unvaccinated . 
  not necessarily . 
  my russian colleague does n't have a deep voice at all . 
  no reason why you should be on contract . 
  save up and buy your device off-contract and get a plan that does n't bind you to a provider for 12-24 months of your life . 
  during my last trip to berlin over the course of 6 days i used up almost 200mb , which was the credit on the telekom card i bought . 
  that 's almost $ 108 ( $ 0.54 / mb * 200 ) i would have paid without the card . 
  my tip for anyone traveling outside their home country : just buy a prepaid sim for whatever country you 're visiting . 
  telekom ( t-mobile ) and vodafone in germany have one where you pay $ 10 for the card and get $ 15 in credit . 
  additionally , 3 ( hutchison 3g ) offers their 3likehome that allows you to use your phone in a few countries in europe without paying roaming fees . 
  what you 've just said makes no sense . 
  so it 's just like schnapps here in austria then . 
  and vodka . 
  the article was meant to inform - nothing more . 
  to shed light on something that seems to be largely ignored or unacknowledged in mainstream media in western europe . 
  that 's how much of chinese middle class is . 
  it 's not about the experience or any deeper meaning - it 's about being able to lord it over others . 
  whether it 's travel , buying a tv or a house/apartment , it 's about placing yourself above others . 
  i have two chinese friends here in vienna and one grew up here while her husband is from shanghai , but all the chinese they know here that are recent arrivals are the same way - it 's all about one-upmanship . 
  her and her husband are thankfully not like that , though . 
  my kosovar friend told me about [ this incident ] ( http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/diplomatic-flap-albanian-minister-caught-driving-stolen-car ) where an albanian minister 's mercedes was actually stolen and was confiscated upon his entrance into greece . 
  i wonder the same . 
  i 'm not a console gamer at all , so my exposure to this whole affair is largely colored by what i read here on reddit , so i wonder how much `` the masses '' actually know . 
  that being said , if it is n't well known among the majority now , these problems will come to light in a large and embarrassing way after the console launches . 
  i would even guess ( and hope ) that governments and consumer protection groups will raise he 'll . 
  microsoft will be put in a very difficult position then . 
  their phones are n't doing well , they botched surface , windows 8 did n't find the automatic acceptance that they wanted ... microsoft has a powerful market position but i ca n't imagine that they can hold it for long . 
  with each blunder microsoft has opened the door for their competitors to viciously attack them . 
  the castle is strong , but is it strong enough ? 
  microsoft is doing just about everything wrong that they possibly would with their new console . 
  unbelievable . 
  how is that a problem ? 
  this would introduce price competition . 
  the same thing happened in austria and we now have staggeringly low prices for mobile service . 
  except that antarctica had been claimed already by several countries . 
  not necessarily . 
  it largely depends on their own algorithms and how they 're written . 
  to all of our turkish members , try installing [ tor ] ( https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en ) . 
  hopefully that works for you . 
  configure your exit nodes so that way you 're not exiting the network from within turkey . 
  [ here 's how ] ( http://www.ghacks.net/2008/01/29/configure-tor-to-use-a-specific-country-as-an-exit-node/ ) .
