  i 've seen those same kind of freaks running and biking up and down mountains here in austria ... must be an alpine thing . 
  i moved to austria from the usa and i used to think i was athletic enough but it seems like anyone doing sports in austria is training for their next iron man . 
  no one is excusing anything but genocide is a very significant term to use . 
  it means a great deal and it 's something that should not be used lightly . 
  except what happened in the congo was not a genocide ... edit : check [ the legal definition of the word `` genocide '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide#international_law ) , folks . 
  it was n't a targeted extermination of the congolese people . 
  the belgians were still barbarians in their treatment of the congolese but it was n't a genocide . 
  there 's no reason to reach a consensus on definitions - [ one was already made in 1948 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genocide#international_law ) when it was formally codified in international law as a crime . 
  my original comment was merely asking if the belgian 's tactics constituted genocide . 
  i have no idea if the belgian colonials wanted to eradicate the congolese entirely or if they simply killed many of them during their rule of the territory . 
  can it fairly be called a genocide , though ? 
  i was under the impression , and please correct me if i am wrong , that belgian tactics were simply brutal . 
  there was no concerted effort to exterminate the congolese people - the belgians just brutalized them and killed them wantonly . 
  it 's going to require a massive shift in human culture , education and overall mindset . 
  it 's also going to need to happen on a truly multi-continent scale . 
  will it ever happen ? 
  i 'd like to think so but it might be a * long * time . 
  been a while since i 've been in the sub , so maybe something has changed in the past several weeks . 
  never mind then . 
  but memes are ok ... ?

  aq was most certainly on the map during the clinton administration . 
  bin laden was actively being watched and there were almost a few operations to take him out - everything from a kill squad in place just waiting for the order to cruise missile strikes . 
  there have n't been many minister appointments that have inspired a great deal of confidence ... 
  pretty much the same in austria . 
  ok , that 's what i assumed it to be : a sort of lobbying satellite location . 
  i went ahead and looked around to see what i could find on wikipedia and i found the four main offices : * [ nyc ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/headquarters_of_the_united_nations ) ( headquarters ) * [ geneva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_office_at_geneva ) ( not z\u00fcrich ) * [ vienna ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_office_at_vienna ) * [ nairobi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_nations_office_at_nairobi ) each of these four offices serves as the hq for various programs/offices administered by the un ( outer space affairs is hq 'd in vienna , as is the iaea ) . 
  i was n't aware that the un had an hq in brussels . 
  the biggest locations are in new york city , ** nairobi ** , vienna and ** geneva ** ~ ~ z\u00fcrich ~ ~ , if i remember correctly . 
  edit : added two locations and removed one . 
  linearity and story . 
  no , it really was n't . 
  * the story did n't make any sense whatsoever coming from the first game . 
  * the gameplay was generally shit compared to the first , leaving the player significantly reduced in how to play the character . 
  * the open-plan approach of the first was eradicated in the second game . 
  you no longer had a multitude of ways to approach a single objective , could no longer explore the game world and were forced to deal with this `` press arbitrary button * now * or die and replay the whole meaningless sequence again '' . 
  * the game was clearly designed for consoles from the get-go and the pc version was a mere afterthought ; the control scheme for pc was clearly indicative of this by how clumsy it was . 
  * the whole pc version was a poorly executed afterthought . 
  killer graphics ? 
  nope , had to wait months for a poorly optimized patch that would spend processing power rendering an ocean that you were n't looking at and in fact left behind a while ago the further you moved into the city . 
  oh yeah , and that little block over in the corner that you 'll never look at ? 
  let 's spend a whole lot of gpu power drawing that rock at the finest possible detail and burning up precious processing cycles . 
  how about that concrete wall ? 
  yeah , we can render * the fuck * out of it and let you boil water on your gpu . 
  the rest of the environment ? 
  looks like shit . 
  [ proof ] ( http://techreport.com/review/21404/crysis-2-tessellation-too-much-of-a-good-thing ), 
  the first is the only one worth playing . 
  the second was shit and i returned the third within 20 minutes of playing . 
  lebanon and jordan are tiny countries and already bursting at the seams . 
  besides , it 's not as if lebanon does n't have its own whole host of problems . 
  some context for those not aware , the term * grenzg\u00e4nger * is used for someone that officially lives in one country but works in another . 
  germany is mostly the same , it 's really not that bad until you get to bavaria . 
  but then the bavarian and austrian dialects are all relatively similar . 
  austria has , in my opinion , the largest differences between the individual states/regions of the country . 
  swiss german is very similar ( or identical in many ways ) to the `` german '' spoken in vorarlberg , the westernmost state of austria . 
  tirol has another dialect altogether - they all sound like they 're choking on their food . 
  swiss german , however , is a whole ` nother animal that it might as well be considered its own language . 
  i 've tried watching swiss tv a number of times and i honestly can barely understand a word . 
  dialects in austria used to be even more pronounced in their differences a generation or two ago . 
  i 'm from the usa and i could n't imagine having learned german in germany . 
  it 's so boring compared to austria . 
  the reason a lot of people think german-speakers do n't have a sense of humor is because german-language humor is based , in my opinion , more on word play that arises from the fact that you can slap a few words together and you 've got another word . 
  sorry , went off on a bit of a tangent there . 
  back to your original question : yes , the swiss are part of the banter but only in western austria or close to switzerland . 
  sure . 
  wo n't be able to understand a word you 're saying . 
  you 've also got all the cash , so you 're buying . 
  go out with a few austrians and germans and get 'em a little liquored up . 
  bring a change of underwear , though , you may piddle yourself a bit . 
  sorry , but please think a bit more before you speak . 
  what safer countries ? 
  talk to syrians that make it to turkey and it 's not like things are all that rosey there . 
  you get scammed out of what little money you have , treated like shit and are n't really all that safe . 
  so you decide to make your way to europe . 
  refugees tell about being arbitrarily beaten by locals and police all the way until they get west of hungary . 
  greece is n't as bad in many ways but the greeks are completely overwhelmed . 
  what are you going to do ? 
  you 're going to try and get to a place where you get food , shelter and safety , fulfill those most basic of needs . 
  just because there are n't bombs going off in countries west of syria or fighting there , does n't necessarily make them safe places . 
  check yourself , man . 
  the isis official magazine ... ? 
  that 's not real , is it ? 
  i 'm going to have to call bullshit on your friend 's story . 
  if you 're on a residence permit , you can stay on the resident permit . 
  whenever it comes up for renewal , you simply renew it . 
  the paperwork is n't hard . 
  if your friend was deported , there 's more to that story . 
  so not a ban then ... 
  banning short skirts ? 
  i 'm gon na need some proof of this one ... 
  a bond is a debt security and that does n't sound anything like a bond . 
  funny , according to the article there was a comment that liquidity in markets is potentially lower ... 
  while i am not overtly familiar with the intricacies of turkish history , i would n't be throwing around the word islamist quite so freely . 
  islamism , or rather political islam , came around in the 50s . 
  it is n't some ideology that stretches back quite so far . 
  please learn to exercise some reading comprehension . 
  i said `` by and large '' . 
  that means not 100 % but for the most part . 
  have there been problems ?
