otto wagner , adolf loos and friedensreich hundertwasser, 
  it changed a bit how our presidents work , because the chancellor did diplomatic visits and travels back then and he gave more power to the chancellor because he did want the decisions be tainted with his reputation . 
  then the following presidents stick to some formed customs and now the president has far.more power then he uses ( or is.aspected.to use ), 
  living near hungary , i would say far more hungarians speaking german then the other way around . 
  shopkeeper and service personal at hungaries border towns usually speak at least basics and there are not less workers who work in austria and live in hungary with a decent german . 
  in short , kurt waldheim did n't mention his later years in the wehrmacht as ordinance officer and denied it . 
  but his name was mentioned in several places and the jewish world congress come into knowledge of that . 
  because of nothing really was known then he was an officer stationed near a place where war crimes happened and in combination of his denial it raised suspections if he participated in this crime . 
  israel then demanded several times he should reveal everything about this time but he did n't ( yes he was there but he did n't do or knew anything ) so they declared him as war criminal and usa followed . 
  an austrian historic commission was formed to investigate what really happened and they came to conclusion that as ordinance officer he must have known but had no power to stop it ( afaik he documented strategy and tactic meetings and protocolled interrogations ) . 
  waldheim did n't run for a second term then, 
  one of our presidents was as declared as persona non grata and could n't entry usa and israel, 
  yeah , everbody knows the famous swedish village is bullerbue, 
  the french are also the most common , but some card games are traditionaly only played with the german one . 
  oh , the german one are called swiss here , we call [ this card deck gernan ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/spielkarte#/media/datei%3adoppeldeutsche_preference.jpg ) . 
  and thr other play with french decks ? 
  the change from chruschtschow to breschnew in general, 
   , they play with different cards those with the flowers instead of hearts ? 
  which are the other cards , german or french ? 
  clarified butter , i accept ghee as substitute, 
  north : wood , orchards and win south : alps , cows and lakes west : alps , more alps , cows and lakes east : wine and corn, 
  they are lockable here, 
  unifying the several state health insurance companies into one nationwide one, 
  19giberish02 and his special question, 
  there is a nice [ yearly summery of our health ministry ( pdf in german ) ] ( https://www.bmgf.gv.at/cms/home/attachments/1/0/6/ch1040/cms1164184142810/bericht_zur_drogensituation_2016.pdf ) it states 30-40 % of young adaults at least tried cannabis , so that would be the most used illegal drug opiate consum gets less popular, 
  in tight mini skirts without revealing anything, 
  it is , it 's still running , you can watch the last 2 shows [ on its website ] ( http://www.wdrmaus.de/aktuelle-sendung/index.php5 ), 
  a other way , i guess better , is to study here again . 
  the visa is afaik is to get and you will have some connections after it ( and students tend to be less conservative and more welcome ) . 
  but you need money for it , the tutions are low here but you need to proove you can fund yourself while staying here . 
  i must admit , on a small world map without political borders it happened i confused the korean peninsula with kamtschatka ... 
  as you are a university graduate , maybe our skilled worker program , [ the red-white-red card ] ( http://www.migration.gv.at/en/welcome/?no_cache=1 ) is something for you . 
  you could apply for it at an austrian embassy at your home country . 
  if you are welcomed?i try to be honest , austrians are a bit reserved against foreigner in generel and from muslim countries in special in the last time . 
  most are ok and need some time to warm up with strangers but prepared to face prejudice ,, 
  they are quite good really , at some parts maybe a lane more would be useful but i guess the terrain makes it too expensive . 
  the disadvantage of a good maintaince is there are often roadworks and it 's financed with a vignette . 
  also there are so many noise reduction walls build in the last years , it feels sometimes like driving in a long tunnel, 
  ca n't be , they were much `` darker '' i think they are those , [ m\u00e4rchen der weld ) ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=m%c3%a4rchen+der+welt ), 
  yes , but afaik kasperl is more `` silly '' i could vaguely remember a german puppet theater show which had fairy tails as topic , especially asian and oriental ones . 
  the puppets were very detailed and a bit creppy . 
  do you know that show ? 
  a german children show i always loved is pumuckl, 
  we had `` forscherexpress '' but that was long after my childhood and before mine children . 
  most popular children show was for sure `` am dam des '' which was a mix of `` art attack '' , puppet show and singen . 
  and `` kasperltheater '' , a puppet theater, 
   but the anti-german circlejerk is strong as well unfortunetaly . 
  but they eat schnitzel with tunke , they totally deserve it !, 
  from germany i like `` die sendung mit der maus '' , it 's more interesting than the other `` how it 's made '' - shows for adults, 
  well , after the 2nd world war with the marshall plan and all i could certainly see people thinking so . 
  there was a time usa felt like the big brother of western europe but that changed more into the big brother over time, 
  you do n't want ot eat that ? 
  think of the ukraine children !, 
  it 's mostly in the bathroom here or in a seperate room, 
  some countries have there washing mashine in the kitchen, 
  yeah , middle class would be three retrievers and complaining about natives not having any kids anymore, 
  indochina and vietnam war , guess it was tpp recent, 
  imho the people have the same to right to voice their concerns about his speeches as he has the right to speak . 
  but yeah , violently shutting down his speeches helps him more than them . 
  this points also to an interesting aspect to of the two party system , wacos of either political spectrum can be associated to their party so there is never a abundance of `` enemies '' for both, 
  well , you could state what you think about him and make the difference ? 
  well , you could state what you think about him and make the difference ? 
  that 's not really my period , but an interesting film from that time is `` der engel mit der posaune '' ( the angel with the trumpet ) which had a uk remake 2 years after production, 
  manner schnitten , should be also available outsisde austria . 
  best dessert : sachertorte , afaik hotel sacher mail it also . 
  and malakofftorte , should be available as charlotte malakoff . 
  schnitzel and beer is indeed a staple here, 
  hey , we won the alpine ski world cup several times !, 
  our womans nearly did it :(, 
  good , i have an irrational hate of this fake dirndl, 
   not really here in austria mekur and billa sells it , but i guess it 's too expensive to become more widespread, 
  right , i missed him too . 
  i 'm sure i missed more , like the mercy killing nurses i ca n't remember the names ... also honorable mentioning of the only murder of the county i grew up and grandpa worked with . 
  she stole hittrach from the steed and poisoned here abusive men and accidently her aunt and some farm animals with it, 
  afaik the support was n't for freeing him immediately , lifelong means here 15 years and after that a regularly evaluation if the prisoners is ready to fit back into the society again . 
  they supported him to get a positive result on his first evaluation . 
  yeah , it backfired and i have n't heard anything similar since them, 
  well ... 
  ethnicity does n't equal race , ethnicity is a sociological term and race a biological . 
  people of same ethnicity have similar ancestry , culture and language , people of same race have similar biological.trades, 
  that 's certainly not true , but afaik in english the term bohemian is sometimes still used, 
  he was bohemian nobility in the austrian empire serving for the imperial austrian army . 
  well ... * [ josef fritzl ] https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/josef_fritzl ) * [ the natascha kampusch kidnapping ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natascha_kampusch ) * an international not so popular but intersting case is the [ `` tiersch\u00fctzerprozess ( animal rightists case '' ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiener_neust%c3%a4dter_tiersch%c3%bctzerprozess ) in short , after spraying a store which sells furs and stinkbombing another store and vandalizing of the car of the owner leaving a note threating that may other actions will follow , a group of aninmal right activist group which regulary demonstrates against fur farming in front of that stores were suspected . 
  as far as good until now , but they wanted to set an exemple and tried to get them with a new law against `` criminal syndicates '' intended against mafia like gangs . 
  there was an intensive investigation including undercover investigator and wiretapping . 
  results were a charge of 200 criminal offence against various members of the group but were all were let fallen because lack of evidance ... 
  i ca n't remember quickly a austrian `` great conqueror '' ( well besides some guy who went to germany ) , also one of the motto of the habsburgs was `` bella gerant alii , tu felix austria nube `` ( let others wage war , you , my lucky austria , marry '' . 
  general radetzky got a nice march dedicatet though, 
  i guess most are ok with it , tbh most people , or at least the conservative folks seem to prefer isolationism and tolerate the eu only of economic reasons, 
  not very . 
  when i really go to the limit , 65 $ with my rusty old 320i, 
  i have more than average amout of kids and get various benefits from the goverment . 
  sure it could be higher , but i do n't think that will convienve anyone to have more kids . 
  most people do n't want kids , and those who want mostly not more than two, 
  quiche, 
  as my potatoe mashine ca n't handle most modern rpgs i play today mostly paradox titles , crusader king 2 , stellaris and europa universalis 4 mostly . 
  for linux there is at least for red alert 1 a open source engine available which should run without problems ( i did n't try it though ), 
  maybe it 's not the most beautiful but i really like our online form , it 's quite simple and straightforward, 
  you are right , reading about it daewoo cars were renamed in gm korea in 2010 and were sold in europe under the the chevrolet brand until last year, 
   tesla funnily i see them at least once a week a model s,
