  ) ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/flotte_lotte#/media/datei%3apassevite.jpg ) and add some veggie stock and really tiny amount if vinegar and sugar, 
  under king otto or the recent one ? 
  freshly cutten chives are also very important, 
  it 's basically a beef soup with cutted pancakes,

  it 's not rare that a runaway dog is shot by a hunter if he thinks it 's endangering the wildlife, 
  not really bad , but not really correct ones ... one policeman was called the 20 $ - police here , if he cought you doing something unlawful like speeding or public urinating he fined you with 20 $ , which is less than the actual fine . 
  cronyism also , had the daughter of the local police chef in the car and instead a fine for speeding i got the `` order '' to buy her cake and coffee . 
  this may fly in the rural spots more than in the city i was always baffled and i 'm still to how much manpower goes into finding modified mopeds . 
  checkpoints where they tested if the top speed of the mopeds and 50cc bikes is over 45km/h were a regular occurrence near our school . 
  also a friend is policeman and her stories shows that backward thinking is really common inside of the police force . 
  she had problems with older policemen accepting a woman doing the work until she was moved too a bigger city . 
  most of this was at a rural location were nothing really happened but brawls between drunken teens . 
  also have to say if there was `` real work '' the response were fast , e.g. 
  someone at our school wanted to start dealing drugs and they cought him right when his first supply arrived . 
  but i 've to say most times they were friendly and correct, 
  yeah , the lynx is domestic too , but i was never that lucky to see one . 
  i thought op meant actual wild cats ... 
  sounds like `` gottverdammte '', 
  sounds more reasonable than the hungarian explanation because many native croats i 've meet had this surname, 
  is their any connection to the name horvat ? 
  i 'm the only one with social libertarianism than liberalism ? 
  dogs non , cats very often . 
  but here at a more rural area most per cats are outside the whole day two so it 's hard to tell if it 's a pet , a feeden stray cat or complete feral . 
  real wild cats are rare , there should be a population at the czech border where the old iron curtain was , as they were left alone quite a time there, 
  but austria is latin/germanic and means eastern realm ? 
  i guess the bavaria stereotype for whole germany comes from the us occupation zone was there . 
  most germans known by the us soldier back then were bavarians . 
  most of it asia and turkish/middle east ( turkish delight , turkish `` feta '' , bulgur , couscous and so on ) , some sweets from nordic countries ( salmiakki ) and former yugoslavian countries . 
  burger buns and tortilla wraps and narn bread could also be found . 
  most international food has n't an extra isle and sorted besides an similar products , e.g. 
  the here famous peanut butter is between honey and nutella und the `` non-jam-spreads isle '', 
  they should include insurance , you are n't allowed to drive a car without insurance in austria . 
  they offer usually two package , the basic one which covers all but you have to participate in the repair cost up to 400 $ if it 's your fault and it 's included in the rates . 
  there is also the premium insurance which covers all with no cost participation , but at higher rates . 
  a colleage had a hard time getting his engineering degree from czechoslovakia acknowledged, 
  you have to test the vehicle is fully road safe ( like the annual test here but more extensive ) and prove you are the rightful owner afaik it 's about 200 $, 
  i do n't hear anyone hides this in austria, 
  i know sixt and hertz prices are from 35 to 100 $ a day depending on the size of the car , but you can look online at both companies it 's also possible to give back the car at another station , but there is a little fee, 
  in th other hand burgenland looks like hungary but `` rich '', 
  no , the devil says it 's against the rules to get out , and the germans stay in . 
  some would complain it 's to hot inside but neither a window or air conditioner would be made because that would create a draft . 
  there is a plan in the same vein of atlantropa to dig a canal and flood one of the sahara basins , but i could n't remember the name ... edit : found it , got the creative name [ sahara sea ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/sahara_sea ), 
  like in austria the vocational training can be started after the 9th grade, 
  maxi , monza and ds were most common here, 
  well , berlin was a long time basically an enclave with a poor connection to the rest of the country . 
  it 's economic development lacked behind the rest of west germany until the reunification, 
  most bikes with more than 50cc here have a 4 stroke engine , i think that was also one thought for making 125cc bike license available for 16 year olds . 
  you forget one of our most important wins , the one against germany in cordoba  honestly , the battle of lissa also inspired one our most badass paintings , [ the one of admiral tegetthoff ] ( https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/seeschlacht_von_lissa#/media/datei%3aanton_romako_001.jpg ), 
  small displacement bikes were usually two stroke ( i would have to guess , but i think up to 250cc ) , after the war until the economy really took a huge jump they were pretty common as cheap commuter, 
  i mean , back than the old puch mopeds were n't really classics and many of my classmates had one . 
  they uses that pumps , but at the classic bike scene today many mix it themselves with a special mixture rate, 
  [ these funny pumps ] ( https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:and9gcrim3r_lpszhsafbgrqpabqz8ernmaxyhvbs3fuovaq76zxoirbsg ), 
  yeah , in austria mopeds and 50cc bikes are still a thing , but mine had 20 years ago already a separate tank for oil and petrol . 
  for the garden tools there is also some more environment friendly mixture with extended shelf live available at the home depots , which i usually buy because i do n't need that much ... 
  i would say the only thing i see being problematic is raw meat and fish, 
  sponges are a thing here , also steel wool sponges for burnt food on pans, 
  i would say slowly since the end of the second world war i mean we had an dictatorship before the anschluss which gave priests special rights, 
  i would say names of popular hollywood artists, 
  i. . . have a dishwasher ... 
  i was ages ago two times in north africa . 
  many people i know make vacation in asia very often, 
  as long no politics are involved i really like it here, 
  maybe not the most breathtaking but i really like that the incopareted the [ town hall into the old city gate ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/grazertor_fuerstenfeld.jpg ), 
  i thin i said last time at a similar question the landhaus is my favourite building of graz  i also do n't take part in the kunsthaus hate , but it looks better from the street level . 
  another special house is that reaally old one near the stairs up to the clock tower . 
  it 's ugly in a beautiful way edit : [ i 'm meaning this house , it should be approx 400 years old ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/graz_kaiser-josef-kai_36.jpg ), 
  yeah i guess he means the same , here in austria it 's the same every state has schools out for summer at a different date . 
  but when you have children this dates are also important for you, 
  i can receive bbc world , but i rarely watch tv nowadays . 
  our state tv dubs and sometimes coproduce bbc docs although, 
  they are a thing in austria , here is [ the styrian ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=yhviidlczty ) but usually it 's not sung , only played by a brass band, 
  tsingtau would also be interesting, 
  yeah , our first private broadcaster runs on cheap `` reality '' tv shows , so they have also a series about the police ( at least every season about a other section ), 
  yeah , it 's taught in school , but after that certain people and the `` school of youtube '' are much more focused on being very germanic . 
  oh , history lessons are ages ago , but i remember caesar was especially a dick to them . 
  afaik the helvetii wanted to peaceful move across the land and sent negotiaters to all tribes and the romans , only he declined them a river crossing and made them look like invaders, 
  yeah , also celtic and germanic people were n't at so friendly terms , a part of their economy was supposed to be selling slaves from germanic border tribes captured in raids to the romans , shackles and chains are common artifacts found along the trade routes ( or they were into some kinky stuff , who knows ... ), 
  they became johnny walkers, 
  there was a rich celtic history before we became a part of the roman empire . 
  it seems many people do n't know that . 
  my children have a double citizenship but when you ask them where they from they would say austria, 
  i 'm living a bit rural , an hour bus ride or 45 min with the car from the next big city and the prices are quite reasonable here, 
  for drinking pink vinegar, 
  he looks a bit like my bosnian friend ... 
  not in that varity , but people sometimes install a row windows and use the balcon as sun room/winter garten, 
  i 'm buying from a ranch when they are butchering so it 's a bit irregulary, 
  a perfect 5/7, 
  well , the sell heineken ... 
  our chancellor could state [ he has already experience in this field ] ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lnrk3pxxci4 ), 
  at one hand i would n't mind but at the other hand i worked with enough people from former yugoslavian countries and there is still so much bad blood i ca n't imagine it will end well ... 
  yeah , also no problems in burgenland , but the wind turbine near my styrian home town causes so much ado about nothing, 
  in austria there is the : * hauptschule and neue mittelschule , it 's grade 5 til 9 and it 's has lowest difficult . 
  it 's usually a preparation for trades or you can change into on of the higher schools after it . 
  * gymnasium or ahs ( stands for higher liberal education school ) . 
  it 's grade 5 ans 12 . 
  it 's humanities , science and languages focused , where you choose the focus yourself multiple times . 
  it 's a good preparation for universities . 
  * higher technical schools . 
  from grade 9 to 13 .
