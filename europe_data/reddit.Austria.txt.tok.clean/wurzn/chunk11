  focus on technical and science education . 
  after graduation you can work as kinda engineer light but it 's also a good preparation for technical studies . 
  * higher economic education school . 
  from grade 9 to 13 . 
  it 's the counterpart of the technical school with focus on economic . 
  and there a school with special focus like the agraic and gardening school, 
  wind turbines ... do n't put it near as settlements , they are noise and give so much shade . 
  put also do n't put it into remote places , because that ruins the scenic view ... 
  yeah , i know two people who were in florida last year, 
  f1 and moto gp is popular and broadcasted on tv , especially since the austrian race track is open again . 
  locally the classic car rally always attracts many people and amateurs race usually at slalom tracks and mountain rally track, 
  only really with food , i like to cook and the traditional cuisine and besides the popular kind it 's kinda hard to get beside some rural places and real pricey specialised restaurants . 
  i also speak in the dialect of the town i grew up , beside some may think it 's farmers speech, 
  i would guess emmentaler and tilsiter , they are both commonly available as cheap store brands . 
  my father works at a diary so i eat more from those types . 
  no , not at my current house , one the weekly siren test . 
  but it did n't really annoy me at other places, 
  we have also some freemen of the land kind , but i could n't recall their name ... 
  i want to see a federalist europe in my lifetime . 
  ( but i do n't think that will happen ), 
  yeah , lake balaton , lake neusiedl and the italien adriatic coast, 
  i guess most will be happy if it gon na be a pure defence army, 
  yes and no . 
  i like the dirndl but today they are so much more `` peppy '' and stylish , were i like the traditional and simplier ones more, 
  tbh i only can think of pirates , that 's the only cause they ware in the news lately, 
   edit : if anyone liked most of these books , i 'm really looking for suggestions . 
   for new ideas for sci-fi stories i really like [ josefsons column in derstandard ] ( https://derstandard.at/2000056316406/rundschau-es-war-doch-nicht-das-letzte-einhorn?_slide=1 ), 
  yeah , there are n't much black people here , most would assuming he would be from africa . 
  also the drug trafficking is often done by nigerian crime organisations so there is a negative connection with drugs and black people, 
  i 've neither heared the negative nor the positive ones here . 
  only slightly connected to the second negative one is that your prostitutes should be much cheaper and more beautiful than here , but i 'm not an expert in that field, 
  we have second families in our basement , but i 'm glad that replaced the stereotype that our basements are only there for hiding [ nazi stuff ] ( http://i.imgur.com/btwfuti.jpg ), 
  i liked the countryside more , there was so much to explore both in beautiful nature and buildings and culture . 
  the b&b s were also all very nice and relative cheap . 
  dublin was also interesting but with all the cctvs and police on the streets sometime it feeled more like `` little london '' ( sorry ) . 
  but i also had the bad luck that i went over when a man was shot down in finglas , there was some gang war connection i could get from the local news . 
  but everywhere everyone was very hospitable , i 'll sure come back in some time, 
  yeah , on my trip to ireland was a different experience than the rest of the coutry, 
  oh , the famous [ negerbrot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rddezkz.jpg ) , although the later design featuered only a palm, 
  could also be come from `` egge '' which is a spike harrow, 
  because of `` karl may '' who wrote some very popular stories about native americans and claimed they are semi autobiographical ( they are n't , he was n't even in the states once at the time he wrote the stories ) we have a bit skewed but very positive view of them . 
   der richter und sein henker that was one of the better books we 've to read for school, 
  the sweet kind : [ milchschnitte ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/milch-schnitte_11-2015.jpg ) the savy kinde : [ gabelbissen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/gabelbissen.jpg ) but i did eat more fruits and butter bread as real `` snack '', 
  * the foundation series * the complete works of strugazki brothers * the short story collections of ted chiang * a song of ice and fire * wolf haas `` brenner '' series * the old `` knight 's tales '' and `` german tales '' books from my grand ma, 
  [ sts - gro\u00dfvater ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6muwrzaygu ), 
  yeah , but it 's in every ad block of bayern 1 ... 
  seeidenbacher bergsteigerm\u00fcsle seeidenbaaaacher seeidenbacher bergsteiger m\u00fcsli from seeidenbacher sorry , my wife listens to bavaria radio so i 've an overload ... 
  90 's and early 2000 renaults have such unreliable electrics . 
  also i would n't call the 2cv a shit car , 
  is there a `` clean '' weapon producer ? 
  glock also had dubious business partners who even may or may not tried to kill him, 
  lada , but our hunters like the taiga/niva, 
  there is a refugee home with like 20 refugees at the outskirt of our village . 
  but other than seeing there children biking to town and the parents shopping the at the local supermarket ( amazing shopping skills , could fill a shopping card with food for only 20 $ ) there is not much interaction, 
  there is an austrian production from the 60s which is a little bit more accurate ( it 's still a `` heimatfilm '' ) , i think it 's called `` die trapp-familie '', 
  also will the sp\u00d6 work together with \u00d6vp again ? 
  or even with the fp\u00d6 ? 
  well , not every eu-countrty is in the nato, 
  a rather short summary : we have now ( or better say had ? ), 
  a goverment coalition of the center left ( sp\u00d6 ) and center right ( \u00d6vp ) party . 
  the head of the center right party and our vice chancellor decided to step down because `` he ca n't work in the current constellation '' ( struggle with the coalition party and much more importent , within his own party ) . 
  the party wanted sebastian kurz as new party leader , but he announced he only would take this position under certain conditions . 
  one condition is that there will be a call for a new general election . 
  the other parties accepted this call . 
  what impact it would have could only be said after election ... 
  i guess the center left party ( sp\u00d6 ) and the eurosceptical far right party ( fp\u00d6 ) will have a good result but i do n't know how the call for the election will benefit or harm the the center right party , their new leader is also much more popular, 
  i guess it makes the already eurosceptic group feel to be forced to be more european which can cause counter reactions . 
   by fighting for europe , you 're fighting for your country , since your country is in europe . 
  that 's an european identity not everyone has ... believe me , there are more then enough people who want have a fence around their country which only lets tourist and goods through and do n't want to get bothered with anything outside . 
  that 's the european identity not everyone has , the nationalistic and eurosceptic parties would n't have such an influx if it were so . 
  and do n't forget of the people who are n't openly eurosceptic but are only for the eu as long the profite from it . 
  imho the problem of an eu-army is a whole other issue and could boiled down to one question : would you die for the european cause ? '', 
  i think the we have n't got such an `` european identity '' yet that many people would answer this question with yes, 
  is it ? 
  i can only think of entering with a valid reason and get visa , but than overstay or do something you are not allowed with that visa ( e.g. 
  work with a tourist visa ) afaik it 's pretty hard to get a valid visa entering from a `` conflict country '' . 
  a wild guess could be that most of people who are deported but entered with a valid visa are either overstaying tourists from richer countries , or citizen of poorer but non-conflict countries which misuse there tourist visa , in both cases there is no chance of granted asylum, 
  it 's ... complicated ... chalk is the mineral which the white cliffs of dover are made of ( german = kreide ) limestone is the mineral a part of the alps and your karst landscape are made of ( german = kalk ) chalk and limestone is both made of calcium carbonate the white stains and surfaces are called calcifications ore limescale ( german = kalk or verkalkung ), 
  afaik if they both seek asylum they could stay until it 's decided if it 's granded . 
  the difference is because the air carrier which illegaly bring him into the country have to bring him back on it 's on costs , so no carrier let 's people usually on the plane without a visa, 
  from the well behind my house , it 's tested reguraly and is perfectly fine . 
  most of the tap water in austria is from the alps , it 's downsite because the alps are full ol limestone and dolomite it 's very hard btw . 
  chalk is a bit a false friend , with chalk you write one a black board, 
  no , we tough had an soviet occupation zone until 10 years after the war but there was no divide like in germany . 
  the iron curtain was along our eastern and northern border, 
  well . 
  not very much , the iron curtain divided us for quite a time, 
  because of rome ? 
  yes , but only 1.92 instead of the eu avarage of 1.58 ... 
  well you brought us the bohemian cuisine so it 's only fair, 
  but at least at christmas only little jesus comes visiting, 
   the liekki\u00f6 would often scare people in the forest by following them and making strange sounds . 
  it could cry like a baby , scream , laugh sounds like a fox, 
  i do n't really know , the new years eve fireworks are also in connection to this tradition . 
  it 's tradtional purpose is to make as much noise as posible to ward off evil spirits, 
  i ca n't think of a specific ghost but there are the `` rauhn\u00e4chte '' , the time between christmas and epiphany which is the time the world of the living and the ghosts should b\u00e9 especially close to each other . 
  the specific mythology and traditions around this varies a lot locally but a common motif is you should n't wash your ( white ) sheets and cloths at this time . 
  if you dry them outside ghosts and spirits ( in some german parts morespecificly the wild hunt ) could entangle them in it and curse it 's owner . 
  the stg 77 , better known as steyr aug the guard uses the stg 58 which is a customized fn fal for drills, 
  is [ empress sissi ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/empress_elisabeth_of_austria.jpg ) counting as a ruler ?
