  dietrich von bern is also a very big name in the mythology but far not so popular like siegfried, 
  [ these are very traditional housings , most are a little bit more modern ] ( https://m.imgur.com/a/mdlpf ) the order of the pics should be from west to east on the map, 
  well , it 's sounding like an interesting adventure ... 
  i had an volgo german descendant as coworker and he saw russia , where he was born and grew up , as his home . 
  but he has n't many good words to say ( but many interesting stories ) about soviet russia and even lesser for todays ( or better say 90 's ) russia, 
  yes ... 
  no , not the gold rusher , they fleed from persecutions after the [ failed revolutions in europe around 1848 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolutions_of_1848 ) i always thought you call them [ fourty-eighters ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forty-eighters ) ... 
  tbh i do n't think about them afaik most of them were forty-eighters, 
  well , it 's naturally you learn this countries , it would be a shame your bombs would have hit them instead of serbia, 
  5 people in household , need about 6 liter milk per week, 
  all the corgies of the queen !, 
  i wanted to say there sure would n't be a simply page where you can book your passage , [ but after some googling there is even one !, 
  ] ( http://cargoshipvoyages.com/viewallvoyages/?regiontoshow=1 ), 
  do freighter and cargo ships still taking passenger nowadays ? 
  i think this should be the `` end game '' of the eu , but we are far away from this now, 
  during my off my professional life i 'm working mainly with european software , like from dessault systems , siemens and sap . 
  no , i would give it to my wife and see if she will eat that, 
  i would use that as pregnancy test, 
  keep them as they are . 
  maybe remove the illogical pump action ban, 
  well , bike could also be a motorcycle, 
  on the other hand with no major nation which is speaking english , we could prospose german as muttersprache for all eu-nations, 
  not common here , sometimes marketed as vegan honey substition . 
  and i guess it would be sorted into the honey shelf and not to the jams, 
  flex, 
  do n't you order your stuff from quelle ? 
  why ... do you know how sweaty balls taste ? 
  well , it 's a small village shop with not the best selection , but yeah d'arbo is the austrian market leader . 
  but nothing is above self made jam !, 
  afaik there is a population which is fed reguraly by hikers passing by and are very tame because of it, 
  well , i see it in every supermarket , but never have seen anyone buying some ... [ we love other spreads tbh ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hnvdgsb.jpg ), 
  norway has a 2 parts secondary education , with a mandatory lower secondary school , the ungdomsskole , you attent until grad 10/age of 16 . 
  and there is the optional second part , videreg\u00e5ende skole , which has additional 3 years . 
  i guess the statistic only counts the attainment to both schools , and for a trades job the first part would be sufficient, 
  hermann nitsch , watch out , it 's goint to be bloody, 
  i would vote for the [ ziesel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_ground_squirrel ) and the [ alpine marmot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alpine_marmot ), 
  since we have now a center left/center right goverment the opposition is splitted into the right with [ h.c strache ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heinz-christian_strache ) as leader since he is the chairman of the right wing party and into the left with the green party . 
  ( well , their leader is [ eva glawischnig ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eva_glawischnig-piesczek ) , but imho she does best when she does n't appear in public , i would see [ peter pilz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peter_pilz ) more defacto in this position with his eye on corruption and mispending ), 
  how do you view the kids and grandkids of the first wave emigrants ? 
  if you buy it early enough you can get that special tickets for the ec train . 
  i could travel for 15 $ from graz to saarbr\u00fccken with it edit : it did get more expensive lately , now it costs at leat 29 $ :(, 
  no , but i read our tooth paste has a higher flourid content , but ca n't verify that, 
  yeah , but i would also say much fresh produces are offered at seperate `` farmer markets '' the farmer markets are usually weekly and the flea markets once a month here, 
  well , if they go to a private for profit prison you have cheap ( almost ) slave labour . 
  win-win you could say ... 
  work for them at shitty conditions ? 
  i would say : * the fall of the iron curtain ( well , not really `` our '' history , but as we bordered to it and affected some of our neighbouring countries it also had an impact on us ) * vote to join the eu, 
  it 's a hard an interesting question because there is no clear definition of the the middle-class . 
  i would say middle class is at least some midly successful small company owner or a someone with an university degree after he settled in his working field . 
  ( i would n't see myself as part of the middle classs ), 
  well it was phased out 1995, 
  looking at it it 's funny i learned the x diffently than both versions ( more like the newer one but with addional `` ringerl '' ), 
  `` knochenmann '' by wolf haas, 
  the one i learned in the 80s looks similar , my sister learned a different font 8 years later edit : [ here is the one i 've learned ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ausgangsschrift#/media/file:schulschrift_1969.jpg ) edit2 : [ how it looks today ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vgbacmb.jpg?1 ) , but i did never have a good handwirting skill, 
  i even did an paper on der prozess but it must have been same sane structured as the book ... yeah , we used im westen nichts neues to compare book and movie ( also umberto ecos der name der rose ) . 
  i was n't really into literature when i was in school , the only book i really enjoyed was `` komm s\u00fc\u00dfer tod '' from the list of contemporary literature we had to write a paper of one of them ... 
  yes , but those are the only one we are winning, 
  for austria and i guess germany too it 's for sure faust 1 i 'm not so sure it 's such a long time ago , but we read a lot of d\u00fcrrenmatt also i could renember die schachnovelle ( the royal game ) and homo faber edit : well yeah , and kafka but i guess i repressed the memories a bit ... 
  football, 
  well there are lots to choose but i would say the 1:0 against faroe islands in 1990 great game by the faeroes, 
  temperature is quiet norm , it was only unusal dry the last month, 
  no , either the suburb is part of the city and nobody is mad they are called as part of the city , or it 's an independent community with it 's own seperate history and they do n't call themselves as city inhabitants, 
  personally i would put spar above merkur , the meat and the fresh fish are much better there, 
  a [ hazel dormouse ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mktcisp.jpg ) was the cutest thing i found in my garden, 
  i would say a bankerl is hard and has no or few polstering , a soft one would be a liege, 
  the wolpertinger , it 's a hare with antlers and wings kinda like your jackalope . 
  after 9 years of school you can be hired a company by a `` master '' or someone who is certificated to teach apprentices . 
  the next tree year you will work on continues more complicated tasks at the company and also attend to a school where you will be reached the theoretical stuff associated to your trade . 
  after 3 years you have to attend a theoretical and practical final exam . 
  the apprenticeship system , i thought it was common but only germany has something comparable, 
  i think he means the ddr as soviet puppet, 
  that hard stollwerck caramel blocks , aslo known as ( dental ) filling remover, 
  god forbid we would land in switzerland instead , 1315 worst year of my life, 
  liechtenstein , it 's the only country where i see a chance to win, 
  well its over 10 years old so maybe it 's still from the good years . 
  i 'm in interested how a a product produced china , but given in order from an american company is counted ( like most consumer electronics or the new smaller harley davidsons assembled in india ), 
  well , i have an lawn mower with briggs and straton engine and that 's it . 
  according to our [ economy minsitry report ] ( http://wko.at/statistik/extranet/ahstat/ah_12_2016v_bericht.pdf ) we imported in 2016 from the states as much as from czechia ( overall , not inly consumer goods ), 
  i 've always wanted to see the states in person one day , especially big sur and the redwood forests . 
  but the things like us-visit taking fingerprints feels like as i 'm not really welcome, 
  it would be more beautiful without [ the fence they build 10 years ago ] ( https://www.amerika-forum.de/gallery/files//40235-collage_boltzmanngasse_695799.jpg ), 
  everbody forgets [ graz ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=graz&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjgzjtu6dbtahvj8rqkhwdccziq_auibygc&amp;biw=1364&amp;bih=644 ) ... 
  i do n't know if they are the best , but one of the carinthian lakes , most of them are nice and have more comfortable temperatures than our alpine lakes, 
  it has a nice , sturdy and thick fence, 
  an asian woman asked if i could take a pic of her with the trams of graz . 
  this was my only interaction with a tourist here ever ... 
   there is a race in styria ( as far as i know ? ), 
  and the only austrian driver i have heard of is niki lauda . 
  not sure if that helps that popularity , i guess f1 used to be more popular here in the past . 
  jochen rindt is quite famous , especially for his posthum championship title . 
  gerhard berger was more recent and a long time a driver , but was n't as succesfull as rindt or lauda, 
  around 20-25 \u00b0 c sunny or light rain . 
  i really liked irelands climate in summer , but here in austria it is n't to bad except the 3-4 summer weeks of 30 + degrees which usually are ending with heavy hailstorms . 
  here it means mostly its a blend of different origins , seen mostly at very cheap or organic honey, 
  really ? 
  i mean a jew or a holocaust joke i would understand but a joke where hitler would be riducaleted would n't really fit her position but i would n't see this as reason for a resign, 
  a 4 on the richter-magnitude , bed did wooble , i thought i only was dreaming and heard of it next day in the news, 
  mostly seen at food to emphase it 's local, 
  indifferent , according to a [ study of our national health institute ] ( http://www.praevention.at/fileadmin/user_upload/08_sucht/drogenbericht_2015.pdf ) 30-40 % of young adults at least tried it once , but there is no really push for a legalisation . 
  the green party ( environmentalist , or at least used to ) , was the main political force behind a legalisation but is quiet around this topic for some time .
