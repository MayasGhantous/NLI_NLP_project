  if you could aqquire it , you usually buy buds and grind it and roll it mixed it with tobacco . 
  the pregrinded is often lower grade stuff . 
  prices were around 10 $ per gramm . 
  we used to smoke it in small groups . 
  but my experiences are literally from over a decade ago , so it could be different today, 
  well , i used to live in graz , the closest thing here you can call a city . 
  for 500 $ -600 $ you could rent a 50-60m \u00b2 flat which should be bearable . 
  buying prices start at 100.000 $ for the same size , but are more realistic around 150.000 $, 
  and i thought tunke is the worst you could do to a wiener schnitzel ... 
  free wiener schnitzel and beer for everyone, 
  well my wife is bavarian but some may say she 's not from a differnt culture ... 
  i think the most different between the us system and the system most european countries use is that here you ca n't build up credit score with a amount of tiny loans , it 's mostly a tracking system for your debts . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong , but what i 've heard in the us when you never took out a loan our use a credit card and you want to have a huge loan or mortgage it looks at least suspicious . 
  here it 's a good sign you never needed a loan, 
  well , it 's my subjective experience that pupils from private and `` well reputated '' gymnasium in the cities to go lengths to divide them from people not attending there and especially from non city dwellers , one form of it is a abandoning the usual dialect . 
  it 's not an issue other higher schools or universities i attended or visited . 
  sure it 's classicism , far more complicated than city/country , but very visible there . 
  and it works in both ways , but for sure it would be better if everyone would let it go, 
  so was there bullying because of other reasons in your schools ? 
  or were every outsider welcomed at as least some nice exotic curiosity ? 
   about 2 generations ago ; even poor people collected money in the whole family to afford their children 's education . 
  it was this way around here , and i know enough examples from austria that i know it was the same . 
  i 've meaned the city/country divide , that parents want there children go to the best school no matter of costs is no different today , which leads to other issues  im sorry for all you farmers boys that i ca n't support your prejudice i do n't want to be to direct , but your postings stick a bit out here in this subreddit , also in other questions , for sounding a bit from the high horse/ivory tower honestly . 
  some may downvote the posts even if the content is true, 
  do n't you think if someone sticks out as `` farmer boy '' in a city school he would n't be bullied for that ? 
  and when do you think it was different ? 
  we do n't produce much of this stuff anymore and when then mostly as co-production with germany , but we did produce a shitload of romantic-comedies with peter alexander . 
  it feels like the fsk is more relaxed about violence today then in the 90 's and so more violence is able to be shown in prime time . 
  the city/country divide is real and old and can go hostile at both sides , that 's not a `` nowadays '' - issue, 
  the radio station fm4 has english news, 
  the closest thing i could think of are the catholic fraternities at university, 
  most comparable would be the `` upper class '' in the bigger cities who do n't like to speak with a dialect because they `` do n't want sound like a farmer '' . 
  but you could even hear an austrian intonation there . 
  cooked potatoes with butter and lamb 's lettuce, 
  i guess [ old church ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/pfarrkirche_altenmarkt_bei_fuerstenfeld.jpg ) from the 13th century is the nearest `` old building '' , i like the [ murals ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/kirche_altenmarkt_deckenmalerei.jpg ) , in this style i 've seen it only in castle chapels . 
  speaking of castles , [ castle riegersburg ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mmhiqe4.jpg?1 ) , not far from my home , was first mentioned in 1138 edit : i think the oldest non-clerical building still in use is the [ old city gate ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/grazertor_fuerstenfeld.jpg ) now used as city hall, 
  it strikes me a bbit odd your list doens ' t include the mesa verde pueblos ... 
  do n't forget the german numerus clausus refugees in austria, 
  did n't get also very mixed during sovjet time ? 
  i could remember my former coworker of volga german descendants said he went to siberia for university and to mongolia for that mandatory farming help you have to do as student . 
  poeple are more open when a little drunk so bars/clubs are a good starting point . 
  hobbies are also a big part , sports too . 
  also friend of friends and so on . 
  it 's usually was mixed here , but always more boys than girls . 
  girls played handball here, 
  afaik it 's the contractors he `` fails '' to pay regulary, 
  [ it was a while ago ... ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/marc_dutroux ) a joke i renember : what 's the difference between belgium kids and belgium potatoes ? 
  the kids are first in the basement and then in the ground ... 
  that beard though ... 
  conchita wurst, 
  dark , like our basements, 
  i love r/sas for a quick laugh , too bad the community there is more like `` mimimi , we are better than america ! '', 
  austria : * stiegl paracelsus zwickl * hirter 1270 * gratzer br\u00e4u , but i do n't which one they have in the keg at the bar in bavaria i 'm usually drinking the local wheat beer . 
  at home i have the ayinger urwe\u00ed\u00dfe or schneider weisse, 
  and then we show the damn prussian who is the boss of the ~ ~ hre ~ ~ eu, 
  there is johammer which builds a electric motorcycle , but the design is , well , [ lets call it interesting ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/johammer_j1_at_iaa_2015._spielvogel1.jpg ), 
  i only have heard this in context of the eu which have n't much to do with the balkans until recently, 
   xena the warrior princess ?!, 
  well , everytime i tired to be romantic i failed horrible . 
  but i appricate her following me into the woods at night ... 
  rape me , rape me my friend ... 
  did you asked them what they think about tunke on wiener schnitzel ? 
  pre 2000 = schilling post 2000 = euro for some the euro is the root of evil , i 'm thinking more , this is old i 've paid still in schilling for that, 
  i thought that in the late 80 's , early 90 's, 
  did the guy with the gum boot on his head also run this time ? 
  i guess we simply do n't like smalltalk that much , big topics we tend to discuss at a beer, 
  other austrian clothing shops i can think of and that are not to localy distributated of are palmers ( well i 've not the right gender to shop there ) and humanic and stiefelk\u00f6nig . 
  in styria there is also kastner & \u00d6hler, 
  [ oh , we are producing for german kids tv !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/5cik5jyipbi?t=7m50s ), 
  yeah he is the first one i thought about when i read the qustion . 
  anothere one ( or better say two ) were the [ two nurses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lainz_angels_of_death ) who killed people with severe illness as `` act of mercy '' . 
  before sunrise it 's oddly `` realistic '' and the protagonists are looking like genuinely slowly falling in love with each other . 
  also vienna, 
  good thing we do n't need a `` personalausweis '' in austria , the `` f\u00fchrerschein '' works everywhere as id, 
  i guess , there are also some local variants of the freeman on the land in germany and austria, 
  well there is also a version where the `` opposition '' killed him . 
  the common core is such a honourful person like him would n't drink and drive , so somebody else must have killed him, 
  also an austrian one : j\u00f6rg haider , an important figure of our rightwing movement died in a car crash with speeding and alcohol involved . 
  a famous conspiracy theory under his fans is that he was killed by the mossad, 
  [ the `` reichsb\u00fcrger '' - movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reichsb%c3%bcrgerbewegung ) which does n't believe in the legitimacy of the german state for vairous reasons in a similar vein the `` brd gmbh '' which believes germany is n't a sovereign state , it 's a company owned by the occupying forces, 
  my wife prefers the shelf variant because it prevents `` poseidons kiss '', 
  the first one is also strong here . 
  i really liked the ancient waggons on the route to work the most , because of the lack of a air condition the first and last windows were always open in summer and no one complained . 
  also since each waggon had it 's own diesel engine so the waggon was always warm in winter ... 
  i 'm more an wendelstein 7x guy, 
  soap bars are unpopular but i guess dove and hirsch are the most common, 
  modest and steel-toed boots, 
  once a month so, 
  uneventful , the town i grew up where a `` resting '' place where they stayed two , three weeks . 
  they camped at an gravel place at the outskirts of the town where i stumpled every other day along at the way to the town dive bar . 
  i do n't know , my kids are simply more well behaved around other people than at home ... 
  i 'm seeing the nissan pick-up ( navara ? ), 
  quite often , but most pick-ups are commercial vehicles, 
  well , if you going through the red light district you chances to see one is significant higher , so there is a little truth in it . 
  beep bop beeb beep , no nothing to see here , move along . 
  honestly i attended a wedding last year and most of the children were given tablets to be quiet while the ceremony which looked very odd, 
  there is a mythos around the mustang , it 's like an living legend . 
  one of my former coworker even imported a 69 cabriolet . 
  the corvette is sadly seen by most as an car for pimps , by sport cars enthusiast it 's seen as much sport potential for it 's price,
