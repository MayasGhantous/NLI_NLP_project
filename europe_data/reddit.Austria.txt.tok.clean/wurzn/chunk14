  i guess the most of them , like my grand grannies are dead by now . 
  well , in the aftermaths of a little `` civil war '' the conservative christian party ruler disbanded the government and established a fascistic state . 
  the working class was n't that happy about that ironically that was done to be standing better against nazi germany which also tried to took over austria but failed until later they assassinated the austrian ruler, 
   okay , but i did n't really get that vibe from the people i conversed with . 
  it was more ... `` germans do n't know anything about austria '' , `` think they 're ( germans ) are better than us ( austrians ) '' ... some cultural things too . 
  well , it 's more a culture thing , nobody really brings the annexion or the whole reich thing on the table today . 
  it 's more like germany belittles austria constantly and see it not as something independent , more like a weird appendix to germany or bavaria . 
  also germans are our largest immigrant group and like to use our infrastructure , especially our universities , but like to complain what 's all so different to germany . 
   and was n't austria ( at least the majority ) , eager to become part of the reich ? 
  i mean , they did n't offer much resistance , if any , to the anschluss , especially as they had been rejected during the german unification i did n't want to excuse anything what happenend then but austria was a dictatorship back then which supressed workers rights , i could see why people were happy at first, 
  well , after some passionated years we had an pretty hard divorce and we concluded nothing good resulted from that relationship, 
  [ i posted this here already a few times ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5pw3r1/how_is_the_health_insurance_handled_in_your/dcubywd/ ) it 's a quite complicated system that works quite good in most of the cases, 
  yeah , as a fellow motorcyclist i would say it 's more a bike thing . 
  on the other hand a common clishe about your country is your campers clog the roads of every european country, 
  i have n't a strong opinion of either , but i was happy van der bellen was elected because i think the fp\u00d6 will be in the goverment after the next general election and it 's just better for us all they have n't a president who would agreeing to all of their ideas, 
  my favourite austrian wine is the zweigelt , if you are more into special sorts try to get a schilcher or an uhudler . 
  also `` eiswein '' ( icewine ) is a thing here , they are really sweet and are produced from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine . 
  if you into sweet wines try a `` trockenbeerenauslese '' , they make here a good one on the base of a sauvignon blanc , but `` ruster ausbruch '' is the most famous one, 
  well it 's better sauceless but not whole germany let their schnitzel get soggy like we austrians love to accuse our neighbours, 
  because it 's german cuisine , it 's a running gag/circle jerk that germans ruin our food with sauces, 
  pizza and pasta , burgers and schnitzel and chinese food but i 'm living quite remote . 
  in the city i could get mexican and indian food too, 
  afaik a large part of them were `` fourty-eighters '' and , well , various refugees from nazi germany . 
  there is also the issue that austria-hungarian citizen from the crownlands stated their ethnicity to the immigrant officercs in the states instead of there citizinship , for various reasons, 
  usually everyday , i 'm cooking friday til sunday and at weekdays my wife cooks . 
  north africa , but ages ago in calmer times, 
  no no , i mean because of work i really have n't much time to read and so most of the books i read are to my children, 
  1 ) it varies , mostly because of work and kids i read more children books then anything other . 
  i prefer short story collections because of this . 
  2 ) a short story collection from ted chiang and the reprints of `` james tiptree '', 
  mostly people from former yugoslavia , albait many slovens are not immigrants , `` only '' working here and living near the border . 
  same as hungarians, 
  [ sorry , did n't find an english site ... ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=de&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.roteskreuz.at%2fgesundheit%2fausbildungen-im-oerk%2fsanitaeter%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) the first course could be done in 2 month , but is n't a well paid job . 
  most people i know are doing/have done it as volunteers , the one i knew which did it as full time job became a nurse after some years . 
  i do n't know about the transferability but there are some courses you could get done very quick here in austria . 
  outside big cities it 's also mostly done by volunteers and people who choose to do a civil service instead the mandatory military service . 
  however , nurse is n't a bad paid job , you have to go to a 3 year nursing school for the diploma, 
  i 've a crt-tv , i always say if it 's breaking down i 'll buy i new one , but that did n't happen the last 15 years ... 
  i usually only watch movies/docs on prime time , i download series for my kids , or the let it watch the stream on their homepage , it 's much better without adds ... 
   never put sauce on ~ ~ sausages ~ ~ schnitzel . 
  ftfy, 
  shoes are usually taken off in the `` gardarobe '' , the first room where the outdoor wear is stored, 
  honestly i 'm finding the pre roman iron age history of central and west europe very interesting with it 's celtic tribes and kingdoms . 
  you are right , better also vier f\u00e4uste f\u00fcr ein hallelujah too where are the times where kabel 1 always broadcasted the movies at saturday and sunday morning ... 
  i mean honestly all the bud spencer and terrence hill movies are trash , from the delicious , insanely funny kind , but trash, 
  we have also a word into that, 
  austrian movies are either very tame and happy or the quite opposite of it, 
  never had anything to complain about them , with their `` red ticket '' options you can even fly cheaply but at odd hours ( like the last or first flight of the day ) . 
  although like others mentioned they 're owned by lufthansa quite a while, 
  when i hear americans complain about taxes it 's often about the poperty tax , which seems very high compared to here . 
  i did n't have space in the utility room so it 's in the bathroom, 
  well , there was gta london ... 
   schnap company first train , i speak to you as the last ? 
  schnaps company first platoon , i 'll adress you as the worst, 
  fond memories awaken when thinking of settlers 1 & 2 and anno 1602 edit : also on the realms of arkania series , were one of my first pc games boardgames : settlers of cartan and carcassone, 
  stellaris is also great , [ in which game you could do this ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/stellaris/comments/653obc/ive_done_something_awful/ ), 
  well they are good with shovels and sand bags, 
  well . 
  i would say the mandatory service does n't really help our mitlitaries reputation, 
  there is a `` meat blessing '' where you walk to the nearest church with a basket full of cured meat , an easter bread , a lamb shaped cake and some hard boiled eggs . 
  after that you have a meal with the blessed food and invite others to join you . 
  or get invited ... and then you invited your family , or get invited after that week you could n't see nor eat cured meat and hard boiled eggs for a while ... thursday ( yesterday ) is spinach day and friday is fish day , many canteens at work respect this, 
  well , but it looks like they are hard on eu and turkey and does n't have any real consequents ... 
  reminds me on the more optimistic stuff from the strugatzki brothers, 
  [ erwin pr\u00f6ll ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/erwin_pr%c3%b6ll ) , he is the governor of lower austria since 1992 , but he announced his step down this year, 
  yes , also the same here the first two years the alcohol timit is nearly zero , and some traffic offenses are treated more serious . 
  with bikes , your limit is 125cc until 18 , then 34kw for 2 years and then unlimited, 
  at the `` higher technical school '' we had to do two times 3 weeks of practical work at a company, 
  the test or the whole procedere to get a driving permit ? 
  the theory test is a multiple choice test on the pc , at the practical test you have to first some manoeuvres at practice place of the driving school like various forms of parking , emergency braking and turns in confident spaces . 
  then your tutor and an official guy who decides if you get the license hops in your car and you have to drive a short time in real traffic . 
  there are also some `` technical questions '' like who to check oil and air pressure you have to demonstrate with motorcycles it 's similar but you get an com device and they follow you with the car during the real traffic exercise and give orders through the com . 
  the technical question at my test was if the bike was a two our four stroke and how to check oil . 
  first i 've wondered that this was broadcasted in germany too , but then i read your last sentence . 
  although i only could renember the title song , the goose mimi and the clown, 
  most similar played here would be schnapsen, 
  that soundes ridiculous , what if you are going bare foot ? 
  are n't those cooproductions ? 
  well then : * am dam des * 1,2 oder 3 and * kaiserm\u00fchlen blues * edith klingers animal shelter show `` wer will mich '' edit : * liebesgschicht 'n und heiratssachen * sendung ohne namen * echt fett * tohuwabohu,

   kottan ermittelt everytime the coffee maker breaks down i say `` kein kaffee f\u00fcr den pr\u00e4sidenten '' and no one seems to get it :(, 
  j\u00f6rg haider , an important figure of our rightwing movement died in a car crash with speeding and alcohol involved . 
  a famous conspiracy theory under his fans is that he was killed by the mossad, 
  now i want to see schilcher as an top export of austria, 
  yeah , there is even a cable car to the top of the zugspitze, 
  salzburg is n't that far away , you can go there by train in the morning and back in the evening, 
  is our wine international very popular ? 
  i guess the industry took a big hit back then with the sugar/glycol scandal . 
  but yeah , we have great wine, 
  it was very common ages ago when i was at school ... at the gymnasium they had a `` smoking pass '' you could get with 16 which allowed you to enter the smoking patio . 
  at the higher technical school it was theoretical forbidden , but the teacher always said `` you did n't see us , we did n't see you '', 
  beer and schnaps, 
  parents with two children seems to be most common, 
  and 2 german cars, 
  our rightwing party is often for an eu-exit , sometines not and sometimes indifferent about it . 
  afaik their last statement on this basicly is `` we are out when turkey gets in '', 
  are n't that the `` open `` s ? 
  inglourious basterds ? 
  * much food is from austria , except exotic fruits and coffee the rest of it is from italy and spain * cars are german * motorcycle is made in brasil ( although a japanes brand ) * the lawnmawer egine is the only made in usa thingy i own * electronics are from japanes brands ( made in ? , the sewing mashine states made in vietnam ) * toys for the kids are mainly danish,
