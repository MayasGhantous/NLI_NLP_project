  it 's varies a lot from company to company . 
  if the company is big enough a canteen is in place and mostly used . 
  otherwise is bring from home or buy at the lunch break . 
  a company i used to work gave coupons to the employees which was either a meal at the canteen or 4 $ off at the most restaurants in town , which was used by many . 
  most of the times half of our office went to the local trattoria back then, 
  and the snake was to proud to be carried ? 
  it was the game of thrones of my childhood , you we 're never sure which animal is going to do die next but you could be sure one will surely die ... 
  they also played a little bit with this , i still remember the episode were the hares dramatically avoid to get sprayed with pesticides but fail and you thought they are next ... 
  but jokes on you , pesticides do n't kill hares ... 
  til , i did n't know that, 
  it 's quite catchy, 
  [ pippi langstrumpf ] ( https://youtu.be/e-knjgdpy78 ) was als huge in german speaking countries, 
  [ mila superstar ] ( https://youtu.be/tnn_qsva938 ), 
  a walk at the zentralfriedhof in vienna maybe , especially the older parts . 
  edit : a non-touristy museum would be the [ technical museum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technisches_museum_wien ) i 'm not from vienna , so maybe others have also good suggestions i do n't know how much time you have , but maybe also hop on the train to graz , [ it 's a really beautifull route ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/semmeringbahn_20-schilling-blick_01.jpg ) and if you are already there , you could visit the [ zeughaus graz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/styrian_armoury ), 
  i did n't saw the movies , but i think the trial about the ownership and all the media coverage makes it more famous than klimts `` kiss '', 
  [ pumuckl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpkg5b4wnlk ) [ heidi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxm2b605p9y ), 
  i 'm living between fields , fishing ponds and a forest , so very green edit ; found an rather old pic , [ view form the balcony ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xbilaeh.jpg ), 
  well , neither for me anymore , otherwise i could invite you to a godly pork roast, 
  i thought a long time all the tofu and typical vegan stuff tastes inheritly bad , but it turned out all vegans i know are just shitty at cooking, 
  til , thanks, 
  well , i know her from her early * cough * `` movies '' , but what 's her serious career after that ? 
  i can only renember her participating some shity shows, 
  for germany i know [ sibel kekilli ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1402546/ ) , international maybe mostly known for shae from game of thrones, 
  best place to eat is at granny 's place, 
  well , technically those forts and fortresses are also castles so why not [ fort jefferson ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/fort-jefferson_dry-tortugas.jpg ) ? 
  honestly i do n't know , but i guess it 's gustav klimts [ portrait of adele bloch-bauer ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/gustav_klimt_046.jpg ) edit : maybe also the portrait of [ empress elisabeth ( sissi ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/kaiserin_elisabeth_-_franz_xaver_winterhalter%2c_1865.jpg ) i like the very bad ass [ battle of lissa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/anton_romako_001.jpg ), 
  well , what would be the purpose of an eu-army , defence or power projection ? 
  i guess an army for solely defensive purpose will be much easier and more realistic to establish , it will cheaper and surely have more support from all members, 
  quite okay i guess, 
  * it is a bit cheating to say [ alt-kainach ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8hh31cn.jpg ) because it 's [ garden houses a public pool ] ( http://www.birdeyeview.at/watermark.php?i=1498 ) were i was frequently as child . 
  * [ hoch-osterwitz ] ( http://imgur.com/alrzm7g ) is a beautiful castle . 
  [ i 've visited it more than once ] ( http://imgur.com/a/n1mok ) * also [ riegersburg castle ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kp8zahl.jpg ) * i also [ like the really ruined ones ] ( http://imgur.com/a/j5ttz ) , it 's kind of an adventure to explore it, 
  wolphram alpha gives me the raking : 1 ) ireland 2 ) czechia 3 ) austria 4 ) estonia but according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita ) czechia is first , 3rd place austria , 4th germany and 10th estonia, 
  it 's objectively a game between czechia , german and austria , with a different leader every year . 
  i can accept a defeat from czechia, 
  christoph waltz maybe, 
  i do n't know if i would call the cold war situation of the post ww2 world the right direction ... 
  sts - f\u00fcrstenfeld / s honestly most traditional songs everbody could recitate are mostly holiday or child songs . 
  but regionaly there are things like that , i guess the `` wienerlied '' , mostly known around vienna , is still sung in the local version of the pub , the `` heurigen '' , is something you are looking for . 
  also there is the `` gstanzl '' which every region has it 's own varities , they often are ironic , satiric and mocking songs , mostly with double entendre . 
  if you are good at it you also could improvise text to it 's logic . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1gm0jewl5s ), 
  kranjska ? 
  certainly i missed someone , the habsburg dynasty meddled with nearly whole europe, 
  historical and present germany , especially bavaria historical : hungary , czechia and croatia , also spain and netherlands, 
  yes/no , it 's public space and if your company can easily be connected to your profile it 's not in your favour to bring politics in . 
  i can renember the case 2 years ago where a porsche apprentice posted '' `` a flame thrower would be the better solution '' under a pic of little refugee girl dancing in a water fountain which was provided by the fire brigade to cool down the people . 
  he was fired by porsche because of that posting, 
  strangely styrian seem to be the most similar dialect to bavarian german , but if you familar with one of them you could easily tell them apart, 
  it helps we do n't see them really as colonies and very few people have a connection to the old empire, 
  * the cabaret show `` herr karl '' is despite of it 's age one of the best and most acurate about austria and his people . 
  * `` ein echter wiener geht nicht unter '' , a very vulgar and self-ironic show about a viennase worker family . 
  well i forgot the / s bue some germans see austrian german as inferior mountain farmers speak than german, 
  well , no german would consider austrian german as a part of their languages , so it seems it was not so effective, 
  in the east especially manufactory and service jobs near the the borders are done by people from the neighbouring countries , but not many are migrants they usually live near the border on either sites, 
  but our colonies are/were our neighbours ? 
  the origin of standardised german is luthers bible translations and so his dialect . 
  but also the moderate right is often pro-eu or at least not working against it . 
  it feels like i saw more naked people on tv as child , but tv also seemed to bit more weird back then . 
  also something you only notice when you watch the old shows , alcohol was much less a concern . 
  in `` pumuckl '' , a ( very nice ) children show you see often people causualy drinking a beer . 
  a minor one which accoured here around midnight once was a bit like that only longer . 
  i thought i had a weird dream and went to sleep again , then i read about the earthquake next morning in the news ... 
  german , they eat wiener schnitzel with tunke, 
  kruzit\u00fcrkn = shit or d'oh it origin is maybe the war against the ottomans ( t\u00fcrken ) and kuruc ( hungary insugents which where backed by the ottomans ), 
  the kindertotenlieder, 
  i like it , but i generally watch it because of the documentations . 
  they had even a architectural themed doc which they explained the history of he buildings and why the architect planned that detail in that certain way and is was nice and interesting to watch even i think more of sedativum when someone would explain me the concept of the show . 
  the one which looks like a wall rug, 
  belarus, 
  usually it 's our own clumsiness which takes us out , not like back then where you had to take the plan the other team booked because you lost against a direct match against austria, 
  well since we hava a mandatory service our requirements are very low ... 
  so just like cordoba in reverse ? 
  and then go from graz to vienna , the semmeringbahn has also a beautiful view, 
  never for germany, 
  yeah , smoke everywhere and complain about nagging non-smokers however , there is a small pipe and cigar community, 
  smoking, 
   vanillacreamfilled cocoscake we call `` sachertorte '' if you call that a sachertorte we can call the k\u00fcrt\u0151s kal\u00e1cs baumkuchen ... 
  i could not eat krapfen other than in fassching-time , it feels not right to me , like eating lebkuchen in summer, 
   chimney cake it 's called `` tree cake '' here and is usually available at fairs , yes it 's quite good, 
  well , there is an austrian dish called `` gipsy-schnitzel '', 
  or the [ nusskrone ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-urprzeg-nme/uvl8kxo6j7i/aaaaaaaabts/x_bcs_wpw6a/s1600/nusskrone1.jpg ), 
  [ schaumrollen ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/schaumrollen.jpg ), 
  yes , but i feel this generation fewer than `` my generation '', 
   and holy shit is the clock tower shadow in that second pic ? 
  it could be , it must be an older pic , looks like taken from the marienlift . 
  it sits now in front of the scs ... 
  next you gon na tell me you forgot about edith klinger !, 
  has n't finland with it 's many lakes the same problem ? 
  for graz it feels like the [ city square ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/16-07-06-rathaus_graz_balkon-rr2_0186-0189.jpg ) or perhabs the [ herrengasse ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/stadtkrone3.jpg ) connecting the city square and the jakomini square ( where many busses arrive/depart ) , because when you are going by tram you will very likely drive through them every damn time, 
  the quintessential austrian film is maybe one of the peter alexander movies ... or the christmans / new years eve special of `` ein echter wiener geht net unter '', 
  i ca n't open your article , but i can tell you there was a famous german writer , karl may , who wrote many stories about native americans . 
  he did like they were inspired by first hand experiences but it was later revealed he was never in america , so many of his discriptions of native culture is , very inaccurate and wonky . 
  but he portraited it mostly positive , more noble wild like . 
  he and his figures have still many fans today and there are cos-play like meetings often , but not with that many people . 
  however , because of him german people have a very positive but not so realistic view of native americans, 
  the 360 \u00b0 geo reportage on arte is often quite interesting and has much fresh content, 
  i liked 4 weddings and a funeral more, 
  i took a field trip to the store and [ this what the jam isle in a village super market looks like ] ( http://imgur.com/hnvdgsb ),
