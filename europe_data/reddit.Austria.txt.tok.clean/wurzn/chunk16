  good , but i 'm not far from the cell tower ( i could see the cell tower on the other side of the valley ), 
  edit : connection type - mobil / lte connection speed - 20 mbit/s down , 5 mbit/s up ( theoretical ) price 25 $ area - rural i live quite rural and have an unlimited lte connection for 25 $ ( it 's an old contract , maybe it 's something better out there ), 
   die sendung mit der maus ( literally the programme with the mouse , an educational children 's programme ) and a quite good one , i love to watch it with my children 3sat and arte have also many great programs, 
  thanks , seems i mixed something up then . 
  i 've asked because we call the thick plum jam also `` powidl '' and use it mainly as filling for good stuff, 
   plum jelly povidla ? 
  and delicious red cabbage, 
  i guess visiting `` stari most '' is one of the most touristy thing you can do, 
  well , it 's easy , everyone i know makes their own . 
  i like to buy lentils and spices at the indian shop , they are cheaper and in bigger bags there, 
  as spraed apricot , red berries and sour cherries . 
  for fillings apricot and plum, 
  i 'm not entire sure , afaik it 's because there were some incidents ( bank roberies and murder suicides ) in the mid/early 90s in a short time with pump guns . 
  that resulted in bad media and politicans who thougt that there must something done against it . 
  edit : also [ `` pump gun ronny '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ewddmks.png ) gave them a bad reputition , a bank robber , murder of one and suspected murder of three people, 
  * our gun law is mostly reasonable , but there a some strange part in it like absolutly no pump-action guns * there is a traffic sign which prohibits motorcycles , it 's mostly used because of noise pollution reasons , but the law behind it is overly specific . 
  it states that it affects `` one-laned motorised vehicles '' which excludes quads and sidecar bikes , which are n't quieter, 
  selling and shipping into an eu country is much less hassle for a company than into a non eu country , even it 's `` only '' switzerland . 
  puss in boots , also i loved the arthurian saga and tristan and iseult, 
  there are some american steakhouses here , also a `` road house '' more specialised with burgers . 
  yes , in the rural area a little bit more common than in person the cities . 
  ok , than i misread your post   they were n't for sale initially , only yellow ones i thought after that line only the yellow ones were for sale, 
  i swear here it 's exactly inverted , yellow for the store , blue to take home, 
  * a composter for organic waste * a red bin for paper * a black bin for non recicle able waste * a yellow bag for plastic * a white bag for nappies * a carton each for glass and cans i 've to bring to a container * a carton for toxic/dangerois waste i can bring once a month to the recycle center, 
  well , w\u00f6rthersee has some nice ones ... 
  croatia , if you can live with peeple beaches, 
  i see troop transporters fairly often on the autobahn and the jets usually on their supersonic training . 
  once i saw a tank on the road , but that 's it . 
  the next base is 20km away from my home and before that i lived basicly in the neighboorhood of one, 
  many of them are dubbed and run on national tv , mostly crime ( like the whole csi series ) and ( sit - ) coms ( friends , how i meet your mother , big bang theory ) . 
  some are good , some are bad , i renembering fondly watching mash and hogans heroes as child, 
  yeah , no european system is perfect too , ours is overly complicated under the surface with much potential for improvement [ ( here i tried to explain it a bit ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5pw3r1/how_is_the_health_insurance_handled_in_your/dcubywd/ ) . 
  but it 's easy to use and provides the neccessary , i do n't know why usa could not implent a better one if there is a will for it, 
  honestly it 's the former yugoslavian i know the least about , and all which comes to my mind now in modern history is srebrenica, 
  flea markets are a thing here , there a big monthly and smaller weekly ones . 
  flea markets are like big yard sales , knifes are not common but you could find some . 
  i do n't know how it 's today but when i was a child there was always some creepy guy selling nazi stuff at those markets ( mostly medals ) fresh produces are uncommon , there are farmer markets for those . 
  there are also specialised flea markets which are four times a year like the one here only for toys and children clothing, 
  some kind of a health care system where nobody has to worry about beeing broke or in debt after some serious health problems, 
  everyday , since the classmate of my son is malaysian, 
  vw golf , skoda fabia , skoda oktavia , vw passat , audi a4 , bmw 3 , vw sharan and seat alhambra funny how few opel you see , 20 years ago you could say half of the cars were vws and rhe other were opel . 
   french press i honestly never saw an french press in austria , the bialetti style perculators are far more common, 
  in graz very often , in more rural areas never, 
  but it comes with free eggs !, 
  a funny traditions is `` egg fighting '' ( i honestly do n't know how it 's called ) , where everyone gets an hard-boiled egg and slams it against the neighbours egg , whoms egg cracks first lose . 
  there are many traditions around food , like baking a lamb shaped cake , baking a sweat easter bread and lots of cured meat, 
  is it merkel ? 
  yeah , water = still/tap water , mineral = sparkling, 
  yes , but when you order a `` mineral '' you will get a sparkling water by default, 
  sparkling is called `` mineral water '' here , if you order only water , it 's possible you will get tap water, 
  the first building was build 1460 , but it 's still not a city the villages here have usually an `` anger '' , a grass area in the middle of the village where cattle was gathered . 
   austria did the same . 
  it 's a door with side parts ! ^ tm, 
   fishing feels less violent but i think it would be very boring for me . 
  well , either you do it alone and enjoy some quiet time or you do it with friends and basicly sit at the lake/stream with friends , have fun and the fishes are a bonus . 
  in school we had several , but it was `` invites only '' not an open house like in the us movies . 
  it 's also quite common to meet with some friends at ones place and drink a little bit before going to the clubs/bars, 
  there were two duplicate comments from me , i deleted one and both were gone ... 
  so once again : i could see two hunting stands and two fishing ponds from my balcony , so i guess it 's quite common here . 
  i was never hunting but regulary fishing when i was younger, 
  it was quite calm from both sides . 
  the rancy motel next to the bordello was/is used as refugee quarter , there wasn ` nt that much interaction beside volunteery one . 
  i only saw them at the local supermarket buying staples . . 
  well i can see the concept would work , it would be much different of course, 
  i think your views are a little bit to optimistic , people only slowly accepting small differences in culture which could also appear when you move from a domestic city to a more rural area . 
  and people have major problems accepting non-white people as austrian . 
  both put people off identify self as 100 % austrian . 
  also the turkish community has an interesting and worrying phenomena that every generation identifies less with austria . 
  i think comedies with to much austrian reference and a very own humour like muttertag would be impossible . 
  it was quite eery , they did n't know who sent the bombs until he got caught by chance . 
  he was quite ridiculous at the court to watch , clearly a madman . 
  there is an old dark joke about his antics : `` what does the fox says ? '', 
  - `` no thanks , long live the bba ! '' . 
  ( fuchs is german for fox ), 
  google said [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_rome_and_vienna_airport_attacks ) , i was too young back then to renember . 
  i could renember the domestic terrorism of [ franz fuchs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_fuchs ), 
  i 've meant kangaroo-australia of course, 
  and we force them to try saying `` oachkatzlschwoaf '' anyway ... 
  luckily we did n't figured out how to win a world war yet, 
  beer and schnitzel, 
  northern california and oregon looked always nice , australia would be also interesting . 
  i avoided it during school time since languages were n't and are n't my strenght but at the 6th grade we could choose between french , italien , latin as 3rd languages or more focus on science ( which i 've choosed ) . 
  if i did n't moved to a technical school after the 8th grade , in the school i attented until then a 3rd language was mandatory . 
  does n't the mistral always comes with some rainy days afterwards ? 
  but i guess it 's more bearable than the others, 
  it 's strange but i can swear in the supermarket they are called tortilla chips , but yes the cinema calls them nachos, 
  oh , bora , jugo and mistral , is n't it ? 
  what ? 
  never heard of them ... 
  rex is also a very common for dogs minka for cats, 
  i think my grandparents generation named every female cat either muschi or minka ... 
  `` muschi '' is an old cat nickname , comparable to pussy . 
  it 's currently not used for cats for obvious reasons . 
  well as land locked country fishery is n't such an issue, 
  the currently second strongest party has an big influence by farmers . 
  sadly they carter more to big land owners , and are generally opposing stricter animal rights and environmental laws, 
  von metternich was pretty influential without beeing a head of state, 
  without googling : * pestalozzi-street * triest-street * two-bosniacs-street ( mamed after the 2nd bosnian infantry regemint ) * mexico square * sweden square * marburg street come into my mind, 
  a bigger city is mostly historical city centers -  larger after war and newer buildings -  highrises and commercial buildings --  industry and smaller homes , especially city centers of `` overgrown '' smaller towns --  farming amd homes the borders are n't that clear , in austria the mayor does zoning , other countries have institutes higher up in the chain which are more stricter, 
  the nastiest shit i 've ever drank and i did drink very much nasty shit,
