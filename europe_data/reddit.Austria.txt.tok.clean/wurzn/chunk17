  just added the link : [ should be there ] ( https://www.google.at/maps/place/46%c2%b055'19.2%22n+15%c2%b000'59.6%22e/@46.9220006,15.014362,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d46.921997!4d15.016556 ), 
  i can give it to you later , it 's at the former skiing resort `` hebalm '' edit : [ should be there ] ( https://www.google.at/maps/place/46%c2%b055'19.2%22n+15%c2%b000'59.6%22e/@46.9220006,15.014362,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d46.921997!4d15.016556 ), 
  this is a question i have to contribute more after work ... austrians rural area is quite diverse , from your typical alpine village to th flatlands of burgenland . 
  this two pics are near my home : http://imgur.com/mmhiqe4 http://imgur.com/0cmedsu and this is from the styrian and caranthian border : http://imgur.com/9dbzbbn edit1 : [ this is the city i grew up ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/baernbach.jpg ) . 
  with the many detached family homes and some old commuty houses it 's a quite typical village , well minus the power plant, 
  yeah , but what i want do say is usually when people wear traditional garb it 's more often a loden suit then a lederhosen . 
  but i also do n't want not count the gabelier crowd ... 
   football : i do n't think we have a rival because you always need two parties for a rivalry . 
  i ca n't tink of any country right now which considers us a rival . 
  well , our secret goal and what we always try is to beat germany , but we always fail catastrophaly ... with one exception of course !, 
  we indeed like schnitzel and beer . 
  we do n't wear lederhosen that much , here is the traditional garb a loden suit anyway, 
  also interesting and odd is they were shortly the monarchs of mexico , i think thats why there is a mexikoplatz is vienna, 
  power generators, 
  the only real inconvenience was shipping large goods overseas , at the place i worked we shipped large mashinery per train to linz and then per ship to antwerpen where it get finally on the route to his destination . 
  really ? 
  at least in written german i read it very often all over the internet, 
  post it also in / r/castles ,, 
  yeah you are right , it should be '' i have gone/i have been to '', 
  austrian german avoids the preterite , nobody says `` ich ging '' ( = i went ) , instead `` ich bin ... gegangen '' ( = i 've been/gone ) is more commonly used, 
  i 'm not sure both variants are used , but definitly mostly in old print/typewriter . 
   '' `` , i should go to bed , i did n't realize the difference ... 
  the ~ ~ `` '' ~ ~ '' `` i usually see only in old books edit : [ like here , it 's one of the oldest books i own ] ( http://i.imgur.com/z286ufe.jpg?1 ), 
  the one in austria is a nature and wildlife reserve and only accesable to public with guided tours . 
  i loved the pubs there , my favourite was one in a small village near tralee , where we stopped to eat something and suddenly two women started to play and sing irish songs . 
  the lakes of carinthia are also very nice, 
  from the time i worked at a company which main customers pay in dollars i like there is no additional `` currency rate gamble '' when trading within the euro zone, 
  i do n't think we take wedding such serious at least american movies and tv shows picture it ... 
  but depending on the size a 10.000 $ wedding could be reasonable prized when the food and drinks are included . 
  looks like [ his bigger brother ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/graz_kunsthaus_vom_schlossberg_20061126.jpg ), 
  yeah it 's more a legend ( but i want to believe ... ), 
  i did n't have one , so i ` ts maybe not 100 % correct but how it looks form the `` outside '' : it usually lasts 3 years and starts after the 9th school year . 
  the company where you get the training needs a `` master '' ( meister , has nothing to do with the academical title ) . 
  every year your training gets more intensive and you have to visit a trades school . 
  also the salary is n't the best at the first year but it rises every year . 
  after the 3 years you have a final test , both theoretical and practical . 
  after that it 's optional to become a `` master '' where you have to visit a school and also have a final theoretical and practical test . 
  it 's of course much harder and focus also more on economics , a meister should know to lead a ( his own ) company . 
  the apprendiceship is n't neither very looked down nor something very appricated . 
  a meister has either a quite good paid job or owns a company so i do n't think people look down on them, 
   in the fierce dispute over her divorce and remarriage , margaret received the nickname maultasch ( literally `` bag mouth '' , cf. 
  maultasche , meaning `` whore '' or `` vicious woman '' ) in contemporary ecclesiastical propaganda . 
  the epithet is first documented in a 1366 sequel of the s\u00e4chsische weltchronik ( saxon world chronicle ) ; she was also called medusa by the florence chronicler filippo villani and is further known by a variety of nicknames , including kriemhild , medusa , mouthpoke , pocket-mouth , satchel-mouth , the big mouth , the mouth bag , the pocket-mouthed , the she-wolf of the tyrol , the ugly duchess , and with the pouch mouth . 
  i like also her connection to [ burghauptmann schenk ( the big guy on the right ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/27bwry0.jpg ) . 
  he threw an ox ( the last ? ), 
  at the the besieger of castle hochosterwitz and let them assume the siege was n't going to be succesfull because if they attack them with food they surely have plenty left of it, 
  \u201e mit der leeren tasche `` ( with empty pocket ) funnily he was quite rich, 
  there are so many of them , but i 'm a sucker for the grazer landhaus .

  [ this was the one i frequented regulary in my youth ] ( http://i.imgur.com/aaqr8uc.jpg ), 
  i 'm seeing them almost never , but i think i 'm not in the target age group too . 
  yeah , it 's hard to decide which one , we have so many good `` mehlspeisen '' but sachertorte is one of the best chocolate cakes, 
  or for documentations : whores ' glory workingman 's dead, 
  never met one, 
  [ i 'm ok with your colours ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/flag_of_europe.svg ), 
  it 's the last name of the chef/author, 
  do n't worry they are also producing [ more traditional looking rifles ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rs12zps.png?1 ) and [ pistols ] ( http://i.imgur.com/goandaz.png?1 ), 
  my in-laws were farmer , but they stoped after the father-in-law died . 
  they had a very small farm with 10 pigs and 10 cattle and some chicks and hares , so it 's not your typical farm . 
  crops were wheat , rye and potatoes for personal use , turnips for the pigs and grass and hay for the cattle . 
  their `` cash crops '' were corn and pumpkins , afaik they sold pumpkin seed oil . 
  also a orchard with mixed fruits , mostly apple and pears . 
  they produced and sold apple juice they had ( and still have ) an steyr tractor , heavy equipment like a combine harvester they rented from an `` maschinenring '' . 
  i think they had `` claas '' mashines but i 'm not sure . 
  one of my brother in law works for kind of home depot specialised on farming needs . 
  my wife hated to collect the colorado beetles , and butcher the chicken and hares . 
  also she said the biggest mistake was to name the pigs , one of her diary entries is like `` today we killed ferdinand '' many farmers also have an 20h job mostly in a relatited fields , to get some benefits like a cheaper heatlh and pension insurance . 
  my father works in a diary and half of the employees there are farmers . 
  it seems it 's time for another coffee for me ... 
  and beer, 
  yes we trink it , viennas main water source is spring water from styrian alps . 
  i think the golden is kind a `` best of '' from all his books, 
  i swear on the [ st. martiner kochbuch ] ( https://www.amazon.de/st-martiner-kochbuch-emilie-zeidler/dp/3702009019 ) , it contains basicly all traditional dishes your grandma made . 
  but the layout and style is also very grandma like with very few pictures . 
  the [ plachutta ] ( https://www.amazon.de/goldene-plachutta-ewald/dp/385033676x/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_3?_encoding=utf8&amp;psc=1&amp;refrid=fm57a0k7wd1ef3hh21pg/385033676x ) is a more modern standard reference, 
  yes , you are right , the exact law text is `` vorderschaftrepetier-flinte '' and `` flinte '' is a shotgun . 
  meat from germany was also under ban because of the mad cow disease, 
  * no pump action rifles i have no idea why , i guess because many baddies in the movies use them . 
  * some fun with overspecific traffic laws : there is a street sign which bans motorcycles , it 's mostly used for residental and hospital suroundings with the addition it 's only calid from 10pm to 6am . 
  however the law based on this sign states it 's valid for one-laned motorised vehicles , so a sidecar-bike can ignore it, 
  i 'm to long out of touch with the scene but the classics still are the name of children and band logos . 
  there was a huge tribal and chinese signs fad , but it seems less common now . 
  we too !, 
  without using google , i could name : * [ high tauern ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/high_tauern ) * [ danube auen ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube-auen_national_park ) * [ ges\u00e4use ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ges%c3%a4use_national_park ) , which is known for rafting and there is d\u00fcrrenstein , i think it 's closed to public and one of the last untouched forests of austria, 
  if i look into my traditional cooking book i could think the essential ingredients is clarified butter ... 
  i 'm living at the edge of a forest and the next house is 1km apart . 
  sometimes you can hear chainsaws and gunshots from the forest and sometimes the corn harvester also needs come at night , but it 's relative quiet . 
  some may underestimate the weird noises animal can make during the mating season , especially foxes . 
  very uncommon, 
  well , our children have double citizenship and she cooks sometimes weird things like pickelsteiner it is n't much different to a relationship with a domestic girl . 
  must be fake news ... 
  sidi bou said was beautiful but very touristy . 
  santorini is also very beautiful, 
  firefox , duckduckgo and google i also toy around a little bit with wolfram alpha, 
  it 's just a prank , bro !, 
   first of all i would be irritated that the light did n't detect my car and turn green automatically . 
  oh , the premium feature of the benz cars , good choice, 
  i 'll wait , i 'm not a cab driver,
