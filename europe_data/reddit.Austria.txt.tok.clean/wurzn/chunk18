  yes but you need a registered business to shop there , or know someone who has one, 
  vienna as the capital and seat of the goverment is seen as bloated head of hte country by people not living in vienna . 
  there are many of such `` jokes '' where you can use the names of the city/state you hate most ... 
  most are puns so they do n't really work in english ... this one does work a little bit : what bush also grows well in the basement ? 
  the [ kampusch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natascha_kampusch ) ... 
  largest are the interspar stores , but they are small compared to the average tesco . 
  we prefer more `` traditional '' malls, 
  i do n't kow how old turtle is but my school started the same age with learning english and my parents generation , well , was n't well educated in english , at least when they were from the `` working class '' . 
  they could n't help me much in english even when they wanted to . 
  my children nowadays started in kindergarten, 
  i guess you could find madonna statues and figurines often around the world, 
  our chancellor suggested a while ago a mashine/robot tax and was heavy criticised for it . 
  i guess the goverments to think about it but it 's too early now . 
  the ride into a post-scarcity society will be pumpy although, 
  ok , well since the lyric change from `` home are you of great sons '' to `` home of great daugthers and sons '' the one who claim to have the most national pride refuse to sing the new lyrics ... 
  what was so bad about it ? 
  i. . . will leave the spelling mistake because of cuteness btw , irish setters are n't that uncommen here, 
  btw , an good european post-apocalyptic movie is `` time of the wolf '', 
  sometimes we aslo have an oktoberfest, 
   it shows shows that because we do not have that many black people living among us , people can be quite ignorant because it is seen as `` the other '' and we are not exposed to much african american culture and black culture in general . 
  oh my , i think the most retro-embrassing memory i have is seeing the first black in real life over 30 years ago . 
  i shouted loudly to my mum `` look , a real neger '' ... 
  yeah , it was graz, 
  you mean breakout ? 
  i ca n't renember the song only the beeping ... 
  some irish pups celebrate st. patricks day, 
  he means the general election of ' 99 ... 
  well , i 've lived in a city where the communist party is in the city council and i have to admit it was the most voteable party there . 
  it was more a leftwing party without the crownism and hubris of the center left . 
  i would suggest the korobeiniki, 
  by international tourists : styria and burgenland, 
  [ donauwalzer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enetopnpiii ) or [ radetzky-marsch ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afm9pv8rypq ) great plus : neither of them has a text, 
  it is , but it becomes less popular, 
  a cup of coffee from my bialetti ^ tm percolator, 
  there is a big difference between the northeast and the southwest of graz . 
  you see much more tagging in the southwest, 
  cross country is somewhat popular but i do n't know anyone who is doing biathlon . 
  one of the long versions of renault master ii , it 's a superb car for moving . 
  the largest car i owned was an old e34 bmw , it was 4720 mm . 
  yeah and i renember the corrupt shit feast when they were in goverment the last time ... 
  they will be voted in goverment because all parties are weak and lost the trust of the people, 
  oh , the wonderful world of anise-spirits, 
  the bavarian grandpa of my wife drinks it all time , he calls it a `` rus '', 
  and add citrus lemonade, 
  like ouzo ? 
  but not when you have the seven mile boots !, 
  it becomes less popular , but at least it seems we are one of the heaviest smoker . 
  growing up in the 80s and 90s i was really the only teenager in town who did n't smoke , now it 's more common smoking breaks every hour are accepted , but a 10 minute break to do something different every hour would be considered as lazy ... 
  this is most applicable at the military , so there was a saying everyone becomes a smoker during the draft sometimes it seems our people see the anti-smoking laws same fredoom threatening as people from the us gun-regulation laws, 
  what are `` trump-like '' movements ? 
  many european countries have a growing alt-right party and i 'm afraid austrias will be in the goverment after the next election . 
  what we do n't have is a two party system which gives the winning party imho too much power, 
   by the way , most restaurants here also have schnitzel ( coated ) with bolognese . 
  pretty sure they are just trolling at this point . 
  when i was young , i guess nothing and they would get the beer . 
  i bought beer at the age of 8 at the local general store for the old alcoholic guy in our neighborhood ... nowadays they are much stricter , in a supermarket they will check anyone who looks young . 
  at a bar with much business it 's more likely you can go `` under the radar '' if you look and act adult enough, 
  cc is extreme hard to optain in austria , you need to prove your life is in serious danger if you do n't carry the gun . 
  [ skandal im sperrbezirk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1gm0jewl5s ) [ dschingis kahn ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzmi3vaihbe&amp;hspart=ddc&amp;hsimp=yhs-linuxmint ), 
  i was simply happy with my beer, 
  i did n't know that , was there a recent change ? 
   you need a specific ( higher level ) licence for a shotgun and rifle interestingly the license for a rifle is the lowest tier here , handgun/pistol is the hardest to obtain, 
  beer and wine : 16 spirit and liqueur : 18 ( and in in vienna , lower austria and burgenland it 's 16 , thx to / u/austrianmichael ) drinking in public : yes but could be prohibitated locally you can buy alcoholic bevarage at every supermarket anytime the law for the bar licenses is a little bit more complicated . 
  edit : thanks for the gold  but the post was n't that special, 
  the hunting shop catalogue my uncle gets also has guns in it and is mailed afaik once a year , but they do n't send it to random people ... edit : [ as you provided an image it 's only fair i do also ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ml63w ), 
  on the 6th of january . 
  at this days ( raun\u00e4chte ) the connection to the spirits and the ghosts should be the strongest . 
  googling it the most resulst are the myth behind this superstition is a rider of the wild hunt could entangle in white bed sheets and be very angry and brings bad luck to the house they belong to . 
  also they steal the white sheets and use it as shroud for it 's owner but i never heard this reason here . 
  the wild hunt is n't a part of the local folclore, 
  the most weird and i know nobody who follows it is : * you should n't dry white cloths outside between christmas and epiphany . 
  the myth behind differs from region to region, 
  other already mentioned some very popular festivals in austria , but i think the most popular is the [ `` donauinsel-fest '' ] ( https://www.donauinselfest.at/ ) because it 's free, 
  we could agree on that tyrol and vorarlberg has a very different sounding accent to rest of austria, 
  well , and i wanted to say tyrol and vorarlberg ... 
  except the skiing resorts whole styria is n't that common with international tourists . 
  the carinthian lakes are also more popular with domestic tourism ( and rich russians ) , it 's also a beautiful area . 
  you can rent a hut in the alps , especially in the koralps between styria and carinthia there are plenty of easy hiking trips available and are n't that expensive, 
  it 's not so common but far far more than veganism , albeit both seem to be growing you can find many vegetarian dishes in our traditional cuisine , but not many vegan, 
  they were meant to be radio-shows first , were n't they ? 
  yeah , but both are military agencies and more comparable to the dia, 
  well , he did n't said wrong , only different, 
  you can do both , in austria these schools go from grade 9 to 13 and it 's a good introduction for stem-fields . 
  but it 's at the cost of liberal education ... 
  well they were the coolest lessons in school , e.g. 
  we made [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tjdjz4e.jpg ) but honestly it 's only taught in the kind of school which focuses on mechanical engineering, 
  really ? 
  except from bavaria it seems germans see in austria their weird little brother with speech impediment which luckily has universities without nc so he is at least somewhat useful, 
  they were ok , well , expect getting milled and eaten by geese , but struwwelpeter gave me ptsd . 
  every time i saw a large pair of scissors my thumbs started to tingle ... [ because this is seems to be a appropriate punishment for thumb sucking ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9gaci5c.jpg ) edit : now with the whole page edit2 : [ there is even the full book available online ] ( http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12116/12116-h/12116-h.htm ), 
  well , it 's was more a joke , but there is a love-hate relationship between the two countries . 
  no , my wife is even germany , the most hated nation here, 
  and the struwelpeter ... 
  no , only how to weld and forge ... 
  except of the infamous `` becherkuchen '', 
  i 'm tempted to post a certain video of the gti-treffen ...  yeah , the car-tuning/culture scene here is mainly focused on european and japanese hatchbacks and small sedans . 
  there is also a not so small but not so visible `` oldtimer '' scene focused on historical vehicles ( mainly european ) . 
  interesting , i 'm not big into british music , but some older bands pronounce it more `` british '' . 
  well , now only the cure and the sisters of mercy come into my mind ... 
  well i 've used [ this ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c3%96sterreichisches_w%c3%b6rterbuch#/media/file:oewb_42aufl.jpg ) in school ( but the old speibgr\u00fcn one ),
