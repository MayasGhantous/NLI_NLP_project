  [ austria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxvupghpvog ), 
  calling nasa a company is odd , it 's an ( independent ) agency of the us goverment and was founded by president eisenhower . 
  afaik von braun was asked if he wants to join , he worked on the missile program of the army by that time and surely was one of the most competent people regarding rocketry, 
  james tiptree / alice b. sheldon, 
  both are fine , it 's available but expensive here . 
  but i 'm afraid they do n't let you with meat through the customs, 
  yeah , i thoughts he s very unknown in the states . 
  americans always wondering how europeans imagine native americans and karl may is the reason for it . 
  well , there is no restaurant , but sometimes the roast a big at the plaza ... 
  yeah , the old schilling ones were ok i liked the 20 schilling [ daffinger guy with his wacky hair ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/20_schilling_moritz_daffinger_obverse.jpg ) too, 
  interesting how the story of your life reflects in your accents , 
  i guess because most common heard english speaking media sounds `` american '' , especially ( pop - ) songs, 
  are his books known in the states ? 
  i would say the peak of the animosity was during the third gulf war , most people found that very stupid and the never found wmd fueled this . 
  i guess there was also the only time it was also directed at the people itself than the goverment because of the , for us , overly patriotic support of the war . 
  nowadays the rising nationalistic/alt-right parties are often anti-usa and pro-russia/putin . 
  putin is n't very discret in his support , but that 's something which makes me scratch me head , growing up the same people told me russia is the big dread in the east . 
  trump makes the situation somehow special , as he is eveything they want also to be . 
  our alt-right party leader were first in moscow after their lose in the election but they also were in washington at trumps inauguration speech . 
  well , we have an official austrian one with 90.000 words , but everyone i know uses the german duden, 
  it coveres more than the eu and it 's not everywhere in the eu needed but it helps when you have it . 
  well , does it really matter as long it 's well implented ? 
  canada seems do well with a single-payer system , various europe countries with compulsory insurance or a hybrid system . 
  you will need/get a `` green insurence card '' in which the countries where your insurance is valid are stated, 
  do n't forget the sausages !, 
  universal healthcare, 
  whats the north german word for it ? 
  it 's a quite common bike here , this and the honda hornet/cb600 are often choosen as starter, 
  500 years ago the 30 years war started so we were n't maybe very friendly to protestants, 
  the taurus is a real nice engine , to bad of the lack of real high speed tracks in austria, 
  bmw and opel the bmw because it 's a nice car , and even with it 's high milage it ' a a reliable commuter on the autobahn the opel because it has much space inside allthough it 's not such an big car ( zafira ) i also have an 30 year old honda cb450 , but it did n't pass the the `` dot '' and i 've put some work into it, 
  as it looks a bit like `` kuchlkastl '' so i guess its a cupboard, 
  my kids love pumuckl , so there is hope , 
  [ the scenes in the tavern were totally hilarious in the tv-show ... ] ( https://youtu.be/5cik5jyipbi?t=12m47s ), 
  a classic , my personal favourite episode is the one with the `` spoanferkl '', 
   around the world with willy fogg , which i also loved . 
  me too , thanks for renembering that . 
  any particular show you liked especially ? 
   i actually never realized how many of these were about dogs my thought was , wow , czech kids surely must love dogs ... 
  i do n't know any of these cartoons , but fairy tale adaptiond from czechoslovakia were also broadcasted here and quite popular . 
  i guess `` drei haseln\u00fcsse f\u00fcr aschenbr\u00f6del '' , t\u0159i o\u0159\u00ed\u0161ky pro popelku is the most popular, 
   i loved the very hungry caterpillar it 's also a popular book here , my kids love it, 
   he ended up just adding for the generel direction like west , east and so on owi , aufi , umi , eini , aussi , dauni and so on ? 
   depends on the age , but when i was younger ( 6ish ) i used to watch nadine , stern der seine , which is essentially an anime about a female batma/zorro during the french revolution . 
  in the series finale marie antoinette is beheaded . 
  i know the series , but i never really watched it , liked lady oscar more, 
  honestly , my kids still watch it today , i think it can explain things much better then adult `` edutainment '' shows like galileo . 
  i think you mean `` once upon a time ... life ; es war einmal das leben '' that was the cartoon inside the human body, 
  they were all also very popular here , also `` niklaas , ein junge aus flandern '', 
  yeah , i guess most european tv stations shared there kid shows and most of it was produced in cooperation with japanese companies . 
  domestic produced were more live action shows here, 
  which country ? 
  most of the shows are sounding familiar but there were n't very popular here, 
  my little sister used to watch it , as i only saw a few episodes i always wondered why they do n't stay in there more powerful forms ... 
  oh , i can see this would cause problems . 
  in germany you could only request your personal stasi file , but there are people which do n't choose too because they do n't wan na know the names of the people who reported the details to the stasi . 
  you could n't know how voluntary the reports were given ... 
  full opening so anyone can see everything ? 
  well , do n't expect someone to kiss you with cold sores, 
  there are many forms of s\u00fclze , i like those made with fish stock and a smoked trout filet in it best, 
  only baked [ like this ] ( http://images.ichkoche.at/data/image/variations/496x384/4/default-img-38739.jpg ) , if they are cooked they are usually peeled, 
  nobody really mentioned it but the cuisine and it 's `` language '' is different , in austria there is much influence from all the former crown lands . 
  12 points !, 
  well , i was n't sure , there is also falco , danzer , ambros , cornelius , ostbahn kurti , maria bill and so many more ... also there is [ hubert von goisern ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efqqprmzin0 ) ... 
  [ sts - gro\u00dfvater ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6muwrzaygu ), 
  i used it when i worked for a company which produced mashinery of an big american company in license , everything was notated in mm and inches . 
  outside of that inches are only common in screen sizes , rim sizes and pipe threads, 
  ice hockey , sometimes i find some time to visit a game of the local teams, 
  god i 'm old , i want to say [ franz fuchs ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/franz_fuchs ) was an `` interesting '' case and i could renember the odd panic when there were news about his bombs but he was framed 1997, 
  to be fair , sopron / \u00d6denburg was also interesting dispute , or the whole story about deutsch-westungarn aka burgenland, 
  first days since chrsitmas which are above 0 \u00b0 celsius on the other side , snow is melting and everything is brown in grey, 
   it 's tor bella monaca well it looks like aplace where all hopes die, 
   i mean - here in rome we have something that might ( somewhat remotely ) classify as such but it 's a former housing estate full with druggies , hookers and thugs . 
  plus it 's so far out in the boonies not even romans have any reason to go there or stumble on it by accident . 
  i wanted to ask if it 's `` vele di scampia '' but that 's in naples ... 
   you can ride a 50cc bike/scooter from the age of 14 here so most people get one for a few years until they can get a car , then many do n't even consider getting a bike again . 
  it 's a bit similar here too , you can get a 50cc license with 15/16 and especially in the more rural areas with not so good public transport connection use it to get to school/work  i ride a motorcycle but it 's more practical than anything ( tiny island , tiny roads , no car parking at home or work ) . 
  i 've no interest in joining clubs or riding just for the fun of it ( i might if we had motorways and countryside to ride in ) . 
  you are from one of the crown dependencies , are n't you ? 
  it 's a bit same in austria , but it seems the organ donor view is more stretched to every rider . 
  on the other side , the village i grew up had an annual motorcycle blessing performed by the priest austria has some hells angels presence but they are quite calm here so it 's not very connected to the public view of biking . 
  here the destination are more to the south to the adriatic sea or into the alps . 
  personally i 've taken no long range trip before , i 've to do some work on my old bike to make it more reliable before ... 
  not really a culutre shok but tunesia in the 90 's , was quite suprised how overly present the military was everywhere, 
  well , it 's outside austria relative unknown we had a civil war and christian fashistic state before we came a part of the nazi germany , the interwar period was quite a wild ride . 
  in annaberg/melk , [ here is an article in english ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2423843/charred-body-austrian-poacher-alois-huber-killed-3-police-officers-paramedic-found.html ) and [ it 's follow up ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2425322/alois-huber-extraordinary-gun-haul-trophy-room-austrian-killer-shot-dead-4.html ), 
  2013 was one incident were after stopping his car a poacher flet , shoot at the police and the paramedics and barricaded himself in his house . 
  later they found lots of stolen rifles in his house . 
  he killed 3 policeman and one paramedic that was major news and there was n't such an incident since them . 
  ( and i thought it was n't already more than 3 years ago ... ), 
  well , in vienna there are some of that kind , [ but they are n't very beautiful ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/flag-g-turm_augarten.jpg ), 
  well , there is one kind of beard style which is n't very popular, 
   afaik , they have their own school system set up and everything ? 
  i doubt that would be allowed here . 
  it 's infact allowed here , unlike in germany where it 's mandatory to go to school in austria there it 's `` only '' mandatory to be educated . 
  but you have to test you are not behind the curiculum at the end of each year  the need for an id , . . that 's also a german thing which is n't true for austria . 
  it 's the place for people who are finding the worst subs of reddit not bad enough, 
  the [ reddit code ] ( https://github.com/reddit/reddit ) is afaik open source and under common public attribution license , so you can use it, 
  when it 's coverd in snow yes , when the streets are full of brown sludge not so ... 
  there is the [ studivz ] ( http://www.studivz.net/ ) for german speaking users .
