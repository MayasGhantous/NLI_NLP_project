  it was very popular in the past but now afaik it 's nearly dead, 
  it 's not the best time , snow is melding here , everthing is brown in grey ... maybe i could do something on the weekend , i 'll look if [ this spot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/81kfdts.jpg ) is ok now, 
  it 's illegal to disrespect a symbol of the state in public acc . 
  to strafgesetzbuch \u00a7 248 , but i do n't know if it was ever executed, 
   but i was thinking about something more related to the present situation of each countries politics . 
  a space where each party had some time to show what they think and people would have to know it . 
  well , the history of every our big parties and it 's precessors is now in the curiculum , the exact term for the subject is `` history and political education '' . 
  but yes , it could go more in-depth, 
  it 's partly in the history curiculum here, 
  there was n't any poll since then , but i do n't think it will have much influence, 
  philips was founded in eindhoven, 
  in styria they are also very commen , especially the octavia station wagon, 
  i must admit i like the look of the building, 
  linz does steel - voest and is also a important harbour west styria does schilcher and lipizzaner horses burgenland does wine , especially ice wine vienna does hot air, 
  do the polish people really find the palace of culture and science ugly or is it 's connection to the ussr which makes everyone hates it ? 
  it 's legal until the 16th week , after it afaik only if there are medical complications which puts the mom in danger . 
  btw , not at home , but i saw [ these deers ] ( http://i.imgur.com/g1bxkoj.jpg ) in dublin while walking through phoenix park, 
  `` diet '' is at least here more connoted with products ok with diabetic diet, 
  `` feldhasen '' so hare is the correct english term ? 
  i 'm living a bit remote between fields and a little forest , the builder of the house must be very deep in the ass of the mayor to get the permission to build there, 
  there are hares and deers in my garden every odd day , i have to fix the fence ... edit : once i saw a pole cat casualy walking by, 
  milka chocolate ... vw and skoda cars, 
  it 's a bit more complicated than the car license , many people i know got the ace ( motorcycle , car , lorry + trailer ) as it costs `` only '' the double of a regular car license . 
  wage is on the lower end, 
   horst , walter , hans-j\u00fcrgen , marianne , doris : old people hey i know many mariannes in my age !, 
  there is a big wealth gap between the industrial north and the agricultural south . 
  it 's ok , in the cities it 's common to commute and in the lowlands at least young people commute to school and elderly use it to go around . 
  many do it for leasure , it got a bit more popular when the e-bikes got more cheaper in the last years . 
  the infrastructure is heavenly depending where you are , most of the cites could improve , where from my house there is a very long cicle path which goes to the hungarian border, 
  i would say `` eine kleine nachtmusik '' from mozart maybe you do n't know it by the name but it 's tune is widely used, 
  would be interesting if any native american knows them, 
  i guess no , it 's a bit odd here , rural austria has many christian traditions which many non-believers particape . 
  i think at christmas and easter there are more atheists in the churches than true believers . 
  e.g at the traditional meat consecration at easter usually the whole town participates , also to `` thanksgiving '' ( it 's different to the us one ) also the baptism is nearly mandatory even in an non believing family because it 's tradition . 
  we have also a term `` baptism certificated christ '' , which mean a baptised atheist . 
  we do have some christian sects , most promiment would be the jehova witnesses and the seven day adventists, 
  german speaking countries tend a little bit to romantice them ( `` noble wild '' ) because of the very famous youth books of karl may . 
  history lessons were more focused on south america and the spanish involment in it, 
  this is kirschwasser , vi\u0219inat\u0103 is more like kirschlik\u00f6r ( or weichsellik\u00f6r to be more precise ), 
  nono , you see , this time it 's different , we are totaly not nazi , it 's even verboten now, 
  i always thought austria and germany are the only countries which have laws against denying holocaust , but there are suprisingly more countries where it 's also illegal, 
  it 's common, 
  you are right , i checked it and it seems only my swiss relatives using it for whatever reason ... 
  ~ ~ the swiss are still using sz ~ ~, 
  the heinz one from the pic is ketchup and mustard and vinegar : http://www.heinz.co.uk/en/products/57-sauces/products/57-burger-sauce, 
  [ pumpkinseed oil ] ( http://www.vinofaktur.at/kartoffelchips-mit-kernoel-110-g.html ) they are quite tasty altough, 
  it 's ketchup and mustard, 
  well , as employee you do n't experience it much different , you are automatically insured and get the rate substracted from your salary . 
  most doctors are contracted and you only wipe the e-card . 
  but there are calls for simplifying the system , the most common is why every state needs his own insurance company . 
  the gynecologist of my wife works also in a hospital and we were once there for a checkup and asked the nurse if dr. xyz was available . 
  she said , i must mean `` primar xyz '' ( the austrian euqivalent of chefarzt ) and was pissed i did n't use the correct title . 
  the doctor on the other hand never bothered about the title, 
  that 's a bit complicated ... every state has it 's `` krankenkasse '' ( basicly a state owned insurence company ) for employees and there is one for buisness owner/self employed and also for severel job groups there is also an own ( e.g. 
  farmer , state employed , miners and train workers ) . 
  so answering this question is not easy as every `` krankenkassa '' handles it a bit different . 
  i 'm try to explain like the `` gebietskrankenkassa '' in which most employees are insured work . 
  first the monthly few is 7,5 % of your salary , but half of it is paid by your employer , the other half will be substratected from your salary by the employer . 
  there are three kinds of doctors : * those who have an contract with the `` krankenkasse '' . 
  they are payed from the `` krankenkasse '' and do n't pay anything at the visit . 
  * `` wahlarzt '' , private doctors where you get a part of their fees back . 
  you pay them and send the bill to the krankenkasse ( or sometimes the doctor does this for you ) and you get the amount of money they would pay a contracted doctor back . 
  * privat doctors , well you pay them , you ca n't get anything back for medication your doctor is prescipting you , you pay a fixed fee , but you can get be exempted under certain circumstances or already paid 2 % of your yearly income for medication . 
  for hospitals , medic expanses are paid by the krankenkasse , but if you are hospitalised you pay a little few per day for the first 28 days . 
  the krankenkasse also pays maternity allowance , health resorts and rehabilitations and so on . 
  the overall coverage varies between the krankenkasse , e.g. 
  the miner insurance my father had paid a week long visit in an yugoslawian health ressort when i had asthma as child a big difference between germany and austria is you have to be insured by a state owned krankenkasse and could pay an additional privat insurence for more coverage . 
  in germany you could be 100 % insured by a privat insurance company but you have to earn a min . 
  amount for it, 
  yeah , i guess austria shares a lot of its traditional couisine with its neighbours , especially those who were part of the crownlands . 
  both are albait a bit too traditional , you seldom get them anywhere besides some small inns in the middle of nowhere or very expensive restaurants, 
  flecksuppe in austria , have never eaten it ... 
  my grandma used also to cook this soup but i ca n't renember the name ... maybe `` einbrenn '' ? 
  [ ritschert ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/kaerntner_ritschert.jpg ) it 's a barley and bean stew usually served with smoked pork . 
  [ heidensterz ] ( http://www.gutekueche.at/img/rezept/6741/heidensterz.jpg ) basicly buckwheat flour with lard , very tasty in a soup, 
  it 's accepted some countries ( like austria ) and in some countries it is n't i would n't rely on it as id abroad, 
  well after brexit they changed their opinion from `` maybe '' to `` yes of course we will '' and finally to `` only when turkey joins '' within a week ... 
  mixed, 
  the winter olympics are huge , the summer are n't, 
  [ well ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ocyk0ogywy ), 
  albait i drove some cars with automatic , from horrible old 4 gears to smooth modern one , i 'm too used to the stick , it 's always odd for me, 
   to this day i prefer the german version of lord of the rings over the english original . 
  hey chef , i guess you mean the version of margaret carroux ? 
  and than there is the state treaty which has the same rank as our constitution, 
  something especially us visitors do n't understand why we have some sovjet memorials scattered around the country and a huge and beautiful one in vienna . 
  we are obligated to maintain those memorials ( and those from the other winners of ww2 ) as it is a point of our state treaty, 
  only in the `` garderobe '', 
  not really , simple drive slower when there road conditions are bad . 
  to be honest the main roads are well cared here and gravelled or salted in winter . 
  sometimes i simple opt out driving a bad road . 
  my first girlfriend lived quite up a steep hill with a bad maintained road , sometimes i parked on the food of it went the last 500m per foot, 
  but it 's ok to do n't like germans, 
  rear wheel drive and winter tires, 
  no but there are enough cunts in every government of all european countries, 
  the grimaldis are the ruling family of monaco, 
  well since people romantice the past and i did n't live through the majority of the past 100 years it 's kinda hard to tell ... interessting years surely would be the economic boom after the 2nd world war in the 50 's . 
  hey , that 's were you can ride fuchur !, 
  to my house it 's a pe - pipe and internal it 's pe-coated aluminum ( it 's a system where you can easily and fast press the fittings on the pipe with a special tool ) drain pipes are usually pvc, 
  i guess it 's too recent for the museum which is focused on farm buildings . 
  also i 'm seeing that more associoted with trades than farming,
