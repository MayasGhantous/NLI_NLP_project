  well i have still an old crt which is meassured in cm ... 
  but i buy i new one when it breaks ... 
  germany is kinda ok i guess ... 
  `` not the yellow from the egg '' = not the best/optimal, 
  i guess the biggest would be the affaire about [ kurt waldheim denial of his wehrmacht activities ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurt_waldheim ) . 
  we had a persona non grata as president, 
  for pipe threads , rims and wheels . 
  i worked once for an big supplier for an even bigger company from schenectady , where i had daily contact with it . 
  i accidently deleted my post , here is an album of my visit in an openair museum for austrian rural architecture : http://imgur.com/a/mdlpf ta pics are ordered from west to east austria , but i do n't know the exact loctions of the specific buildings, 
  the view from the gloriette at schloss sch\u00f6nbrunn is also very nice, 
  if you like traveling by train you should n't miss the `` semmering bahn '' connection between graz and vienna . 
  and would she inherit the crown from charles or will it go to william ? 
  but would n't than camilla be the queen ? 
  and the greek region is called makedonien, 
  just call it vegan cheese and it sells here too ... 
  ~ ~ lead ~ ~ freedom flavoured, 
  i always thought it 's `` christ bless this house '' in latin edit : `` christus mansionem benedicat '' acc to mr. google, 
  no , it happens often to get mistooken beeing german . 
  but one time in germany they thought i 'm swiss , i have clearly no idea why they thought this and i found it hilarious funnily most are more friendly after stating i 'm from austria , especially in the netherlands this happened often ... 
  as someone from a country with mandatory service i think that 's the best way to be sure nobody would approve an eu army, 
  the puplic pool of my hometown and the foodstand outside it 's dive bar had `` dutch pommes '' , fries mate with a `` ras frites '' mashine , they were/are my favourite ... 
  they were made with some kind of potato dough ( or simply mashed potatos ? 
  i do n't know ... ) pressed through a grade directly into the fat . 
  i know it 's wine was very popular in the ussr and has still a huge wine industry for the size of the country, 
  well in the 80ies little elemtary school me goes shopping to the `` grei\u00dfler '' , a little cornerstore where you order your things at a counter . 
  on the shopping list were some staples , like flour , milk , bread and cigs for my father . 
  on the way i met the friendly neighbourhood drunkard sitting in his frontyard who saw me and asks me if i could bring him a sixpack because i 'm already on the way . 
  he gave me a little bit more than it has cost and said keep the change . 
  little me had no problem to get the beer and the cigs and spent the change of the beer on sweets . 
  thinking about it , the country has changed a lot since then, 
  yes and no , as you can obtain a 50cc license quite easily with 16 scooters ans 50cc bikes are very common in rural areas and somewhat common in cities . 
  motorcycles are more seen as toys , would n't say they are uncommon but riders are often looked down at and seen as `` organ donors '' . 
  125/250cc scooters and vespas are often seen in the city because of the advantage of lane filtering . 
  motorcycles are often in the 600cc and more size , mid sized like mine 450cc are quite uncommen . 
  and he did n't say which cross ... 
  yeah , i have an traditional cooking book and around 70 % of the receipts are vegetarian . 
  funnily most of them call for butterfat and/or sour cream . 
  the change in our national anthem ... 
  they changed a line from `` home are you of great sons '' to `` home of great daughters and sons '' . 
  personally i think the change was unnecessary , but the shitstorm and controversal debates it was causing was overdramatic . 
  yeah physics was 90 % math at our school . 
  and ( si - ) units , understand the unit , know the unit , breath the unit . 
  maybe not high literature but i really enjoyed every book from wolf haas . 
  i guess they are hardly known outside austria , ca n't imagine they translate very well and are too `` austrian '' for germany i 'm more rooted in sci-fi so , for european writers i would choose lem or the strugatsky brothers, 
  ca n't think of an austrian one so i nominate `` felidea '' from germany, 
  asserting dominance, 
  2 days in november , `` real snow '' is more common in january and february, 
  but we were much more relevent in the past !, 
  ( just like in this reality ... ), 
  there was a evacuation of a districr in my city some years ago for a smaller bomb they could n't defuse and had to safely detonated at it 's finding place . 
  the most were grumbling because it 's an annoyance but nobody thought it was an overreaction . 
  the shockwave of the explosion of the already `` safe contained '' bomb shattered all windows of the neighbouring buildings ... 
  i only say as it is , when you talk about `` die rechten '' in german politics it 's usually implied you mean far/alt-right . 
  the moderate right is called , also by themself , mostly as `` the conservative '' . 
  i do n't know why , maybe because the conservative parties try to cover the whole sane rightwing spectrum and right of them are only the fringe left ( csu-politican strau\u00df : `` there should be no legitime party on the right of the csu '' ) it 's not so extreme with the left but also it tends to mean the far left ( leftwing parties like to call them the `` social '' parties ) . 
  on the side note , `` leftiest '' is becoming a more common course word used by the alt-right here, 
  `` run of the mill right wing '' is called conservative, 
  well , i could piss in my well ... 
  the fluoride is in the toothpaste here, 
  i would n't count all supporters of hofer will elect the fp\u00d6 at the next election but around 35 % is a good call . 
  we have also some movements not ( officially ) supported by a party , mostly some branches of german movements ( e.g. 
  identit\u00e4re , pegida , reichsb\u00fcrger ( germanys freeman on the land ) ) but they are not very significant, 
  do n't forget the freetown of christiania, 
  interstingly the bavarian granny of my wife cooks many things which are unknown or seldom here . 
  like the `` pickelsteiner '' , a meat stew , which i never heard of it before, 
  if someone could survive the fauna and flora of australia i 'm ok with pardoning him, 
  czechia and slovakia : thanks for the good cuisine you brought into austria, 
  we too ... 
  grappa , amaretto , limoncello , aperol , martini and campari, 
  the first reminds me a bit on the `` once upon a time ... '' - cartoons , an european-japanese cooproduction . 
  once upon a time life is imho the most popular and is about the bodyduntions and has the several cells as personfied characters ( like the white blood cells are `` police starships '' shooting at bacteria ), 
  i really ca n't think of a creation myth or origin legend , we were a frontier march at the east ( that 's the origin of the name \u00d6sterreich and austria , both refer to eastern realm/land ) of the duchy of bavaria until babarossa granted the it the archduchy state and independence of bavaria . 
  ( afaik more as solatium for giving the rest of bavaria to a guy whose troops barbarossa needed ) however our flag has an intersting origin legend . 
  leopold v , a duke of austria , participated at the siege of acre during the crusades . 
  for the final battle he wore white garments and a belt with his scabbard , after the battle he was covered in blood and after releasing his belt he had a single white stripe on his now blood red garments . 
  the legend is not true because the coat of house babenberg , the house of leopold v , carried the red-white-red coat of arms before the siege of acre edit : i guess the lack of origin myth/legend is because the land changed their ruler often and so had influx of many cultures in the age other countries had their origin myth . 
  when the base of the germanic unification legend of germany occured , on the land of later austria was a roman province and former celtic kingdom who addepted the roman culture because of tight economic relationship . 
  it 's named similar , l\u00e4ngdskidor is called ( ski - ) langlaufen ( ski-lengthrunning ) , we call `` nordic disciplines '' all l\u00e4ngdskidor variants and ski jumping ( which is a bit more popular here ), 
  alpine far more than nordic . 
  handball and ice hockey is also popular but very seldom broadcasted . 
  f1 has many followers , especially since the red bull ring is on the racing plan again, 
  it 's the most logical when you have a point you can label as the lowest possible refer to 0 and avoid negatives at all . 
  it 's hovever for sure not the most convenient for everyday life . 
  how precise do you need to know the air temperatur if you are not a scientist ? 
  it 's very handy to have a quite distinct value where water is freezing , especially for road safety . 
  but i think the one you are more used to is the more convienent for you . 
  approval of the eu instantly raised, 
  afaik the name in germanic and oldgerman were propageted in this times and went very fast out of fashion after it . 
  bielefeld , to make a conspiracy theory real and just for the lulz, 
  germanic names , my grannies and their generation had pretty germanic names that are uncommon today . 
  my grandmas were named gerlinde and irmgard, 
  not exactly like the simpsons , more like rosanne and married with children and also older productions * [ ein echter wiener geht nicht unter ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ein+echter+wiener+geht+nicht+unter ) , about a working cass familiy in vienna . 
  it 's known because of it 's coarse humor * [ kaiserm\u00fchlen blues ] ( https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kaiserm%c3%bchlen+blues ) , about the life in the vienna district `` kaiserm\u00fchlen '' also notable , [ herr karl ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kuv7vzyr_q ) should be a satirical portrait of the avarage austrian, 
  the alpine folk is a bit different than the rest , but i would guess the most difference would be how rural your place is . 
  hawara, 
  i 'm using inox-pans , but non-stick is far more popular than cast iron , it 's mostly used for roasting on open flame ( like chestnuts ), 
  and gabalier is also hounting the german media now ... 
  sometimes i think the city i grew up is the only one who had n't any problems with them ... 
  they came every odd year , camped for a month at an old quarry and moved then again . 
  but yes , there was nearly no interaction with them and they kept for themself , only the little childs tried a little to communicate but they did n't speak any language i understand and vica versa .
