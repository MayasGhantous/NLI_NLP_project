  ( i wandered there often because it was a shortcut to a bar i frequented very often im my youth ), 
  as austrian i 'm somehow ashamed of myself i did n't thought on the [ `` schwedenbomben '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/schwedenbomben_packung.jpg ) they are similar to the ~ ~ neger ~ ~ schokok\u00fcsse , but are n't that sweet, 
  i 'm addicted to that shit and here in austria you only get the german brands ... 
  yeah , a big sponge cake , cutten with a thread in the middle and filled with cream and sometimes pickled peaches or apricots . 
  i have to as my mother in law next time , i think she simple call it `` biskuitkuchen '', 
  the bavarian granny of my wife always makes this cake , it 's some kind of buiskuit-cake, 
  also we call small pickled herring `` russen '', 
  it 's disputed whats the real origin of the [ `` malakoff-torte '' ] ( http://images.ichkoche.at/data/image/variations/496x384/4/malakofftorte-img-38184.jpg ) , but it could be named in honor to the battle of fort malakoff at sevastopol, 
  there is a really good sausage called [ `` polnisch spezial '' ] ( http://www.wikimeat.at/uploads/tx_chiliwm/polnische_01.jpg ) but i havent seen it outside of austria . 
  also sausage , the complicated case of `` frankfurter '' and `` wiener '' sausages . 
  hurghada was very popular for cheap beach holidays , i do n't know how it is today, 
  always in r.e. 
  with the teacher , but we had n't it every day, 
  as tourist my personal best experience was ireland . 
  my granny used to make it as snack for me ... lard wih greaves on a dark rye bread , is more delicious than it sounds, 
  our middle school was extreme regarding this . 
  the elementary teacher used this to wait everyone calmed down , but some of the middle school teacher were/are the most smug people i met in my life . 
  always emphasing they are more than ordinary teachers , never call them anything but professor or magister ... 
  we used to do it until '45 so, 
  well , you ca n't say they were gentle ... 
  standing up when the teacher enters the room , wait until he says good morning , than sit down . 
   the smug austrian waiters . 
  well , i ca n't argue with that ... 
  they raised it since them , the last time 2014, 
  game of thrones is a bit a weird example , i know many who read the english books because of the translation issues with the names and additional waiting time for the german book . 
  and german media is foreign media in austria , 
  although it was worser in the past . 
   and that is the difference to austria , they had this financing via a toll from the beginning so there was no need to make higher taxes for the car-owners . 
  i do n't know what you mean with `` from the beginning '' but the `` vignette '' was introduced 1997 and their were no tax reductions or anything because of this . 
  i did n't say germany is evil ... well , in austria there were any tax relieve with the introduction of the `` vignette '' , i would renember ... we pay/paid for the road maintance with taxes before and after the introduction ... 
   i thought the austrian tolls and stuff ( i know the french are ) were for all users not just foreign users but if they 're just for foreign users then i 'm opposed to those as well but i 'm approaching this from a tourist perspective where i 'll be spending a bucket load in fuel and sales tax if i 'm there . 
  they are for everyone, 
  the main difference is that this road tolls are for everyone , also for citizens of the country who collects the toll . 
  the whole political situation right now . 
  no party is really likeable and besides town council election i always thought i have only the choice of the lesser evil . 
  yeah , but in the east we have fewer of them and it gets quite flat, 
   i dislike the landscape well , we have some variety , which do you do n't like ? 
  because we use iren and nordiren, 
   scots = ~ ~ white ~ ~ johnnie walkers beyond the wall ftfy, 
  white wine with sparkling water or almdudler . 
  vodka orange ( basically a screwdriver ) vodka red bull and cola rum ( cuba libre ), 
  i can only think of [ `` kastner & \u00d6hler '' ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/graz-sackstra%c3%9fe-kastner_%26_%c3%96hler.jpg ), 
  hey , they did even a kind of pledge of allegiance, 
  the closest thing we have are scouts, 
  i do n't think there is enough consent in this subreddit for creating a single party ... 
  well , * cough cough * . 
  she states the price in forward and you pay her afterwards with tips if you liked it . 
  it 's more what you call a lapdance , this `` strip shows '' you see at a stripclub are here more seen in brothels as `` appetizer '', 
  edna and harvey , the whispered world and deponia they also made some `` das schwarze auge '' adventure games , but i have n't tried them, 
   never heard about them !, 
  what 's the use of them anyway ? 
  are there masses ? 
  or is it just a place to pray or something ? 
  the easter meat blessings are done also at the little chapel here . 
  for germany i miss here : * the daedalic point 'n' click adventure games * the ( early ) settler games * the realm of arkania series, 
  orf ski challenge !, 
  some self produced jowood are n't that bad , i had fun with the industrie gigant series, 
  ubisoft milan did some work for the assasins creed games, 
  nothing tops a good made `` schweinsbraten '' with dumplings and sauerkraut . 
  in my whole school career we had two snow days . 
  and it was n't really snow days , the busses of one half of the county did get stuck in the snow , but the othere half of the county had to go to school ( was a big highschool like school for the whole county ), 
  czech , thank you for your cuisine, 
  the most time has sunken in anno 1602 i guess, 
  they are here but rare , but there are [ smaller version ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/sankt-georgen-kaernten.jpg ) called `` marterl '' or `` bildstock '' and are very common, 
  i have to watch black mirror , it sounds very interesting . 
  british comedy is also worth to mention , from mr.bean to little brittain , it 's always good for a lough, 
  it 's hard to say , there are excellent movies but with a very `` austrian feeling '' which is n't appricated much outside of it , on the other hand there are productions which are quite avarage but more international and more popular ( kommisar rex would fit in that category ) silentium !, 
  would i nominate for the movie category , it has quite good production values and is quite good to test if you like the austrian humour . 
  tv series is hard to say , `` ein echter wiener geht nicht unter '' is one of the all time best , but i guess it 's too `` austrian '' glawoggers documentations are also something special , try `` workingman 's death '' and `` whores ' glory '', 
  til , i did n't know . 
  the alt/far-right is sometimes discussing her to challenge the law because it 's against freedom of speech . 
  i mean , they are not wrong , but usually they have no supprot because you can guess there motivations, 
  yeah , like in the whole sane world , but only in germany and austria you have to face prison , up to 10 years here . 
  beef jerky is available here sometimes but very expensive, 
  denying holocaust, 
  i wrote [ here a longer comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5etaxd/how_do_you_celebrate_christmas/daf2bpf/ ), 
  because of 1315, 
  yeah afaik that 's also reason behind it . 
  in the military , we have a mandatory service , so i would say at least half of the 18 + male population has . 
  here in austria the gun law is a little bit weird , it 's very easy to get a rifle , but a pita to get a handgun . 
  there is also a concealed carry permit , but it 's nearly impossible to get ( you have to prove your life is in danger if you do n't carry a gun ) . 
  well , some say we do n't need one because a other party carter all their needs ... to be fair the party is beside graz not important , an there not because of `` communisn !, 
  '' , the leading members are liked and have the reputation of taking the concerns serious and personally . 
  and if you want , it 's the only real `` anti-establishment '' party there , the local leader of the blue `` anti-establishment '' party is member of one of the more wealthy families in graz, 
  ernest kaltenegger , with him the communist party became a important member in the city goverment of graz and the party succeed to get into the styrian parlament . 
  he was known for donating half of his salary and doing much charity in general, 
  there were some interesting , the referendun about the conscription is the most recent . 
  every male have to do a 6 month mandatory service or a 9 month `` civil service '' ( mostly as helper in health care and as paramedics ) , in 2013 there was a referendum to abolish the consription and get a professional army . 
  first it was intersting because the center left party was against the conscription , but it was the party who introduced it in hope a army of conspripted soldiers would hesitate more to shoot civilists . 
  also not the whole party had a clear position to this issue . 
  the center right party and the far right party was for the consription , first there were very good points for it , like there was n't a real plan if we abolished it and the point a professional army would be cheaper was n't so sure . 
  i have to say many conservative people , mostly the older , are looking down on man doing the civil service , a common view is they are not really man . 
  also regardless how you view the army , it 's fast and cheap disaster relief service is highly respected . 
  so the campaign of the rightwing parties commulated into two points , if there is a professional army there will be no disaster relief service and no-one will come to help you , and if there is a professional army there will be no more civil servants and the paramedics will come later and the healthcare would be worser , especially for older poeple , because in elderly care there were the most civil servants . 
  the second point was very often brought by politicans and in advertisment . 
  so the referendum came and older people voted for the conscription and the conservative and rightwing parties won because the people were afraid there will be no civil servants anymore , which many of the rightwing supporters despite and are looking down on them ... also a very interesting referendum was the one about our nuclear powerplant zwentendorf , afaik it was also the first nationwide . 
  i 've never seen it myself but i always seeing the ads for it . 
  i guess it 's easy to buy in , the amateur class seem to be very stock compact cars and rwd cars, 
  we had the f1 and even better the moto gp here this year  localy car slalom and rallye is a bit popular, 
  in oldtowns of the larger cities and outskirts with mansion like buildings .
