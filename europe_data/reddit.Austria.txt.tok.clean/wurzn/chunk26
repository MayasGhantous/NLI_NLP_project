  and what did you want to say here ? 
  do you think anyone here does n't know their countries public education system is financed by taxes ? 
  and taxes spent on education are bad ? 
  bavaria is quite big although , only a little bit smaller than austria, 
  it 's nearly free , the public universities are charging 363,63 euro per semester . 
  however the public `` fachhochschule '' ( college , university of applied sciences ? ), 
  could charge the 363,63 euro but is not obligated to do afaik only a quarter of them does it , the other are free edit : if you are asking why the odd number ? 
  i guess it 's 5000 schilling, 
  i must admit i was never in tyrol and vorarlberg . 
  yes , but thinking of both combined makes me shiver, 
  it looks like something straight out of sim city, 
  we had an `` graz day '' in the last week of elementary school with a guided tour . 
  visited the zeughaus , watched the `` glockenspiel '' , saw the `` turk in the window '' and went through an non public accesable air-raid tunnel under the schlo\u00dfberg and came out direct under the clocktower where we get a look at the clockwork mechanism . 
  10/10 would do it again, 
  yes , settle some elves in the downtown, 
  hofer and strache and both have quite a chance ... 
  it 's a dumb & dumber quote , where he confuses austria with australia . 
  its refering to an older tourist add , where an australian guy promises he will `` put another shrimp on the barbecue '' for the american tourist . 
  it 's usually the first comment if austria is mentioned in the reddit wilds, 
  thanks for the indeep answer !, 
  why ' 75 ? 
  because of thatcher ? 
  and lucas industries ... 
  he is controversal and for most of the conservative folk more the antichrist , but [ bruno kreisky ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bruno_kreisky ) is one of the more liked politicans we had . 
  internal he is known much for his deficit spending politics and promoting of welfare , one of his quotes should be be `` new debts would give me less troubled nights than new unemployed people '' . 
  for styria [ erzherzog johann ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archduke_john_of_austria ) is bit a national hero , under his reign the country was heavy modernised . 
  if you also interested in medival warfare , [ zeughaus graz ] ( https://www.museum-joanneum.at/en/styrian-armoury ) has one the biggest collection of armors and weapons, 
  i ca n't hear the `` another shrimp on the barbie '' joke anymore ... 
  preparing it is a bit tricky , 
  yeah , about the possible entry of the nephew of gerhard berger , a former austrian formula 1 pilot, 
  thanks , i have n't heard both of it before . 
  especially the woman one , french woman fall in more positive stereotypes here . 
  i guss it comes from the old `` hairy woman smoking cigarette '' foreign-film stereotype . 
   around the eiffel tower when tourists are n't there . 
  is this even possible ? 
   * we do n't hate animals and there are n't cadavers of horses and dogs around the eiffel tower . 
   * women are n't hairy . 
  what 's the source of these misconceptions ? 
  nowadays i would say mostly * rye bread * potatoes * rice * pasta * tomatoes * carrots and corn * lamb 's lettuce * kn\u00f6del * pork and turkey meat * cheese and sausages * scarlet runner beans i renember in these were more common in my youth : * polenta * buckwheat products * rolled barley * parsnip * lamb meat * red cabbage * sauerkraut * trouts and carps * innards were far more common ( `` kutteln '' , `` beuschel '' , `` milzschnitte '' ) * and blood based dishes and than there are common but not so often eaten dishes i would not count as staples , like various game meat, 
  austria co-produced some childrens anime with germany and japan , like [ nils holgersson ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0296386/ ) and [ biene maja ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133295/?ref_=fn_al_tt_7 ) but animated film is n't our speciality, 
  [ heidi ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070968/?ref_=tt_rec_tt ) is also an very popular example of the 70ies coproduction , miyazaki also worked on this series do n't forget [ felidae ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109791/ ) a film noir with cats and how someone could forget the [ werner-movies ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100912/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ), 
  i would hate that clearly defined social group and liked the more close community in our class ( maybe because the lack of girls in my school got rid of a big part the manly man behaviors ) . 
  we have a big prom like ball in the last class of the higher education schools . 
  it 's income usually finances a travel for the whole class, 
  we use it , but not in general , some communities pay for it , the most not . 
  it 's also not 100 % proven that it 's actually working, 
  it 's more popular than chicken , but it 's not in indruduced in the wild . 
  common pouldry game is pheasant and not soo common duck and capercaillie . 
  where i life mostly hailstorms , which the insurences are taking care of . 
  in austria generally floods and mud avalanches , sometimes avalanches . 
  the fire brigade which is in charge in an natural disasters is mostly voluntary , local volunteers are aslo not uncommon , nationwide it 's mostly donations either money or goods . 
  at very heavy disasters usually the military is called for help . 
  well , i have a painting of him and mary and baby jesus figurine for the christmas crib, 
  well , at least in the past they supported us , let 's see where this wild ride is going to . 
  the whole `` west '' thing is very amorph . 
  it 's usally used in a `` us vs. them '' thing and most of the former eastern block would hold to geographical west and central europe . 
  then there is the `` western values '' thing , also not defined . 
  capitalist economy , agrees to human rights , and , for many most important , non-muslim ? 
  also check for a large part of the former eastern block, 
  no , third world , like austria, 
  yeah , but what is the west ? 
  in an hypothetical east vs. west conflict they would be on the western side . 
  if you wan na see this in the old east v.s. 
  west manner , everyone who activly supports the nato is west . 
  but whats your definition of the western world ? 
  also funny , the highest quota was germany becoming soccer worldchampion, 
  [ acc . 
  to some statistic i 've found for 2014 ] ( http://mediaresearch.orf.at/c_fernsehen/console/console.htm?y=5&amp;z=1 ) it 's `` tatort '' , a german crime series . 
  but this includes only broadcasts by austrian tv-stations and most watch also german tv . 
  i would guess it 's games of thrones overall, 
  austrian movies are vere `` special '' , some are very artsy and others are very direct , but most of it have this special `` way to see things '' you see hardly outside austria and if you do n't `` get it '' you wo n't enjoy them . 
  tv-production is a very mixed bag , there are pearls like the `` universum '' - documentations or funny looks at our society ( braunschlag or the older kaiserm\u00fchlen-blues ) , then the run of the mill crime production , emulating the run of the mill crime german crime series . 
  and at last there are the huge cheap `` reality-tv '' - production , a part of it very low quality `` slice of life '' and dating shows and part of it talk , gardening and music shows for older folks . 
  sometimes i miss the simplier but funny productions like `` echt fett '' the state tv shows many american comedy and crime series and german series , sports and the productions for older folk . 
  then there are the two `` little '' state tv channels which show more unpopular sports , documentations and `` culture '' ( theater , opera , jazz ) . 
  there are also atv , our first private tv station which produces huge load of `` reality '' tv and `` servus tv '' owned by the redbull-owner and braodcast sports where he is involved and sometimes quite good docs about extreme sports and alpine sports and traditions . 
  most of the people are watching the german tv stations too so there is huge influence of them . 
  music , well it 's also a mixed bag . 
  there is this huge money making mashine of faux-taditional and folk music , which is whery popular with older folks and now also with younger ones . 
  when you see a bunch of fake dirndl and lederhosen there is usally a concert of this near you . 
  there also the `` real '' folk and traditional music , many young folks find it boring and it 's ties to the christian traditions doens ' t help it . 
  albait the traditional brass orchester is very strong going and it 's usually a honor to participate . 
  there is also a pop ( - rock ) music scene , which i 'm not really into it . 
  we had a very driving pop-music scene decades ago , which felt very genuine austrian , the newer one either tries to emulate this and fails or feels very `` german '' . 
  the support of small local bands/formations is luckily very strong and you get a huge varity out of it, 
  [ germany has no good experiences with kisses ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/bundesarchiv_b_145_bild-f088809-0038%2c_berlin%2c_east_side_gallery.jpg ), 
  you may hate them but still greet them this way see it as judas kiss, 
  is that a secret code ? 
  you are only a real corsean if you kiss 5 times ` ? 
  my bavarian relatives do this , but they are all older folks . 
  you can , but mostly only once, 
  yes , you kiss woman/girls you know better 2 times on the cheeks . 
  i guess thos related to our politicans are unique . 
  like our alt-right party leader blaming everthing coming from abroad ( like bad weather ) and the preference of the vienna major for wine spritzer and short working hours, 
  archduke johann has also a very good reputation in styria , hence his huge modernising efforts, 
  well a friend of a friend ** cough ** told me once , he gave her afterwards a little tip, 
  oolong tea, 
  i never see it in the shops here , but we are making it for ourself every year, 
  now living ? 
  or in our history ?
