  ( that would be easy ... ), 
  the girl from gti-treffen is missing, 
   btw : when they say good bye in bavaria , they say `` f\u00fcart di '' ( do n't know how it 's written ) which absolutely sounds like `` fick di '' to me . 
  which means : `` fuck u '' pfiad di , i never heard it spoken with a \u00dc , but it comes from `` b ` hiad di '' --  ( gott ) beh\u00fcht dich, 
  many thanks !, 
  i meant pawlatsche . 
  i always found the word for the balcony which connects several flats funny , but i forgot it ... edit : it 's pawlatsche , thanks to / u/slusny _ cizinec, 
   in austria it 's the state of vorarlberg in the very west . 
  my thirst thought too !, 
  generelly there is also a big gap between everyday accent and the more oldtimey one old people sometimes still speak, 
  my wife is from bavaria , but she lives hire since her childhood , so it 's cheating . 
  before marriage our kids had weird nationalities because of law changes between the first and the second, 
  and then you have also go through the balkans , have n't you seen `` a serbian film '' ? 
  tunesia ( ages ago ) - very friendly people , but also much military could be seen everywhere . 
  i liked the food ( much veal ) and the architecture . 
  overall it was a nice experience, 
  well , i citated the state treaty , afaik you can count both as our constitution, 
  basicly the allied and associated forces recognize austria is restored as as a sovereign , independent and democratic state, 
  no streetview here ... 
  i would n't say it 's common or rampant , but here in the rural areas where you can evade the police at back/forestroads it happens . 
  the police does a much work to get the drunk driver of the roads and i guess it works quite good . 
  also note , that we can drink at 16 but drive a car at 18 , so we usally do n't have a car at our first binge drinking experiments ( btw the moped and 125cc motorcycles licenses are available at 16 ), 
  yeah , something like this with additional tomato sauce and meat . 
  lasagne btw : i have a cookbook which lists a very good receipt as `` traditional lasagne '' , it 's basicly a `` al forno '' with soup vegetables ( leek , carrots , celery roots ) added to the souce . 
  is this a thing in italy ? 
  there are barely highspeed trains here , but there are sometimes special offers for international trains ( `` eurocities '' ) which are quite good and ca n't compite with the cost of going there by car . 
  i use it to visit the grannys of my wife 500km apart, 
  it 's in direct correlation with our drunkeness and your willingness to buy us drinks, 
  with my little children i usually take the car , also bus and train . 
  but if there are not some special offers , going by plain is usually the cheapest solution, 
  there peak was some years ago , but both are still popular . 
  it was good practice and some cities have a local law like this ( munich afaik ), 
  living in a very rural village , the church of course ... 
   i 'm actually not entirely sure if they are presold mixed here puschkin time warp, 
  i know the difference between ae and be corn because of it, 
  haha , well i think the only motorcycle shops here without money problems are the piaggio and the harley shop, 
   aperol spritz you are are right , i forgot the prosecco , i usually do n't drink it . 
  it 's very common by `` italian lifestyle '' people , usually driving around with vespas and openface helmets with il tricolore on it, 
  welschriesling , gr\u00fcner veltliner and blaufr\u00e4nkisch are very common in austria and cheap to get . 
  hungarien muscat blanc is also available near at the border . 
  ( btw . 
  it reminds my driving with my grandpa to hungary and buying small barrels of dirty cheap muscat blanc there . 
  maybe that was also smuggling because there was a certain limit of alcoholic beverage you could import ), 
  usually you use a `` fruitier '' wine ( i do n't know proper english wine terms ... ) it 's quite sweet and mild , a typical summer drink ... 
  the first three dinks i mentioned are more popular with younger people, 
  [ almdudler ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/almdudler ) is a herbal soda , the most comparable drink i know is ginger ale , but it 's a little bit sweeter and does n't have the ginger after taste, 
  i gon na focus on the odd ones , vodka orange ( basicly screwdriver ) and vodka lemon are the most common in the clubs , beer and wine at bars . 
  almi = white wine + almdudler diesel = coke + beer sauschneider = beer + raspberry soda schilcher redbull = a local sour ros\u00e9 wine + red bull paragleiter = amaretto + gin + red bull then there are the `` hip '' one : hugo = prosecco + elderberry flower syrup apperol spritz = a rhubarb/bitter orange liquor + prosecco ( thx / u/arnold _ layne ) + sparkling water, 
  go through the election without any further problems , it 's already embrassing and annoying enough, 
   in austria we do n't really have that please do n't forget about [ republik kugelmugel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kugelmugel ), 
  it sounds like a polandball script, 
  yeah it seams they would have less independence and competence as austrian bundesland ( or even part as a united tirol ) , so the more level-headed one are fairly content with reamaining in italy, 
  i like strolling through the new section and there is a big amount of articles stating this there but never upvoted very often, 
  according to the / r/europe posts , how the brexit definitly did n't and will never harm uk, 
  i hope van der bellen , alone how the fp\u00d6 handled the election they deserve to lose ( have knewn the issues before the elction , but instead of adressing them used it as a 2nd chance ) , but i guess we gon na have a blue chancellor after the next election and this is far enough power for them ... 
  right now : schimon peres died hot topic : our presidential election, 
  printed circuit board , albait it was invented by an austrian but in england, 
  where alt-right and new age mixes asatru is a bit common . 
  personally i met some bunch of wiccas , were strange people in a lovely way . 
  overall it is n't that common, 
  yeah , it depends if there is more the the north german , cold and efficent , stereotype used or the lederhosen stereotype . 
  btw . 
  international s\u00e4chsisch seem to be far too unknown ... 
  when you frequent dive bars and petrol station at odd hours ( under the week after midnight ) you kinda find people like this . 
  but then you are propably also one of them edit : and of course you see all kind of people at public transportation my favourite distraction while commuting was spot the `` deix '' - caricature, 
  some german dubs of american tv-series use danish if there is a joke involving someone deos n't understand german . 
  in `` malcom in the middle '' the german family who owns the ranch were danish in the german dub, 
  the whole lake region around it is very nice , but more touristy . 
  ( or less , depending on the specific lake ), 
  well , that is n't an excuse for us . 
  i do n't how bad or good it 's in the states , but if he is looking `` arab '' he is going to face prejudices from not too small part of the people here too . 
  i would say it 's a bit too optimistic view , the `` muslims do n't belong here '' is one of the main points of all the alt-right parties wiht hugh rises in popularity in western europe, 
  country music belongs to our more idealised views of the states . 
  it was on our to do list at our last visit but somehow we circled around , stayed some days at bunclody , but only visit the coast and the hills at the carlow/wexford border . 
  next stop was cork than ... 
  rijeka is really beautiful , despite one of my first memories of it are buidling full of bullit holes . 
  i love the road along the istria coast up tu rijeka, 
  graz and klagenfurt, 
  i think we had it in late elementary school , the whole unit and unit conversion things, 
  but budweiser is a beer from bud\u011bjovice and pilsner is a brewing style ? 
  pilsner urquell is a pilsner from plze\u0148, 
  there are a sort of cakes which literally translate to `` cupcakes '' where all you need is a cup to meassure the ingredients, 
  for this amount of cheese better ask tante antje, 
   `` spice measure '' we sometimes use for spices `` one tip of a knive '', 
  deciliter , ~ ~ i 'm seeing longdrink glasses often marked with it . ~ ~ i thought of centiliter , deciliter are also in some older receipts used, 
  i think the old official name was marburg an der drau, 
  we use it only for food , and the younger ones not so often, 
  afaik graz was founded by slavic tribes , hence the name, 
   \u0160t\u00fdrsk\u00fd hradec i guess it refers to the historical name gradec ( little castle ), 
  but caution !, 
  there is an european budweiser an there is an american budweiser beer . 
  it ' t mixed , liek others said , pressburg is n't used today , maribor is often called marburg , szentgotthard is often called st. gotthard , but sopron is never called \u00d6denburg . 
  strangely for opatija is often the italien name abbazia used, 
  you give them a lot ? 
  because we would go bare feet then, 
  after you have eaten frogs and snails ? 
  is the `` identy crisis '' of the state , the paramilitaric troops of the parties , the februar uprising , the fascist federal state of austria and the pact with mussolini against an anschluss and the july putsch on your curiculum ? 
  it seems it 's only tought in austria because hardly anyone knows about any of them . 
  ( well , we were n't really important after the first world war ), 
  would you give a guy a foot massage ?
