  it 's supposed to made out of leftover palatschinken ( assuming there will ever be leftover palatschinken ), 
  yeah , but it does n't feels like so , the bad things in the musical happened after the anschluss, 
  nobody seems to know about the troubled times between the two world wars,

   russians wanting to be german : do n't know much about that , but it could just be people living in russia identifying more with german lifestyle . 
  lots of descendants of volga germans moved to ddr and later stayed in germany . 
  the one i know identify with both cultures but liked to become a german citizin, 
  quite safe but nearly anyone is doing it today , also there a only few who would give you a ride . 
  i usually give them a ride , but they tend to need to go in the opposite direction, 
  * math * applied math ( statistic and stochastic ) * physics * mechanic ( kinda applied physic ) * drafting * production engineering * electric engineering * it * chemistry * german * english * law and economy * pe * workshops ( forge , foundry , mechanical workshop ( lathe and milling ) , tool design , cnc aided design , welding and metalurgy ) i 'm sure there were more but it 's really a long time ago,

  relevant user name, 
  [ bbc nature ] ( http://naturedocumentaries.org/category/bbc-documentaries/ ) is also very good, 
  the austrian state tv produced some good nature shows under the label `` universum '' . 
  it seems there are some on youtube : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m-8fsv69nq https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfo-7fogwcq, 
  both , the former is easier when combined with the later, 
  no , and preppers trust gold more than dollars, 
   icelanders : slightly less introvert than the others . 
  they are like one big family, 
  it has a really nice landscape and we have nice food , a bit on the fatty side , but very tasty . 
  also the whole traditional foods which are sadly not eaten very often, 
  they like binge drinking in their woods . 
  and sauna , and after that they jump , still naked in the snow or in a cold lake . 
  to be honest sweden is better known here , because of the whole astrid lindgren stuff, 
  now i 'm wondering if there are more mustang cars or horses in europe ... 
  but good idea , next time i will bring a lipizzaner or a haflinger if someone wishes something austrian ( sorry slovenia ), 
  a mustang, 
  * 2 austrian * 2 italian * 2 german * 1 greece, 
  the view of our army is very bipolar here and one cause of it is the conscription . 
  in general it 's highly regarded as disaster relief service , you do n't get litarally thousends of men who clear your village after a mud avalanch or build a tempory flood dam so fast and cheap as calling the army for help . 
  the ability to defend the country and how useful a army of many mininal trained conscriptionists in the modern world is general in question . 
  every male citizen has to do a mandatory service , either 6 month ( 9 in the past ) in the army or a 9 month `` civil service '' which means often worker in eldery care or paramedic . 
  this leads to a light schizm and funny outcomes in the society . 
  the conscription was a child of the leftwing party , there ideas was a army of avarage joes would hazitate more to shoot at civilists than a highly professional trained army . 
  i do n't know how it is today , but men doing the civil service were looked down in the 90s , not seen as manly and/or as lazy hippies ( funnily i know many who choose the army because it 's shorter and often only the basic training is demanding ) . 
  the conservative party , normaly against every idea of the leftwing , also liked the conscription and sees it as way to make the youth more `` manly '' , has ranted often about the civil service in the past . 
  now to the funny and very austrian part , in the near past there was an election if we keep the mandatory service or etablish a professional trained army . 
  it was iniciated from the leftwing , because many of there young voters saw the consricption as outdated . 
  the conservatice party was against it , of course , but one of their reason was hillarious : `` as many people do the civil service today , the health and eldery care is depending on it . 
  when whe get rid of the consription there would as no civil servants and the paramedics may come to late to and there would be no one to care fore you in the eldery home . '', 
  many older people voted for the conscription because of it and so it stayed so the conservative party who always talked shit about civil servants said cleary we ca n't do without them , and all the `` manly man '' voted to still get cared from the `` lazy hippies '' . 
  there were of course intellegent reason for the consription , like who does the disaster relief service then , or is the professional army really cheaper and more competent . 
  i 'm courios , what means `` too flexible '' in this case ? 
  so many tears were shet ... watership down was also very hardcore, 
  `` you ca n't trust usa , better trust putin '', 
  yugoslavia , some very hazy memories about krk and the statue in opatija, 
  i only could renember veery cheap production in this style , nothing worth to mention . 
  btw : do some german speakers renember bravotv ? 
  if you count burger king and mcdonald as american themed than yes . 
  although there are some diner and roadhouse themed restaurants , usually specialised in steaks and burger, 
  i think there was much influence from the czech studios also to west germany and austria , the fairy tale adaptions were really popular here, 
  `` heidi '' and `` the rose of versailles '' and +1 to pumuckl , i still watch it today with my kids, 
  the austrian `` eh '' , it deos n't even exist in german german, 
  [ samichlaus ] ( https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/285/776/ ) ok , it 's a little bit cheating because it 's a swiss receipt, 
  there were some where i ca n't find an unbaised and/or english article so here is a funny one : once the mobilised litarally hundred cops , a tank and a helicopter to evict 40 punks, 
  i wo n't disagree you about g\u00f6sser . 
  personally i 'm preferring murauer as standard beer , but maybe because the bar where i spent the weekends in my youth had only it, 
  an older slang for syrup in austria is dicksaft ( saft = juice ), 
  her career peek should be around 2000 and this was also my time as horny teenager . 
  i really do n't know renember if her movies were anything special , but in times of shitty internet you always knew her name stands for hardcore without kink starring a big breasted blond woman , so it was always a sure bet . 
  this could be the root of my confusion ... is celeriac very common in todays english kitchen ? 
  * glances at the bookshelf and the book `` b\u00f6hmische k\u00fcche '' *, 
  [ silentium ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386038/ ) is my favorite austrian movie , also [ glawoggers ] ( http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0322198/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 ) ( rip ) documentations . 
  i think [ die f\u00e4lscher ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813547/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) and [ die klavierspielerin ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254686/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) are international the most recognised . 
  and then there are very austrian films like [ muttertag ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107625/ ) where i think they does n't work outside of austria btw , a suprising movie with d\u00fcringer is [ der \u00dcberfall ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250837/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_23 ) and honorable mention : [ der herr karl ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273646/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ) , more a kabarett piece than a movie . 
  it 's vital to understand the austrian mentality, 
  afaik the leaves itself could be used like parsley leaves to make a vegetable soup, 
  back in my youth it was gina wild, 
  +1 for atlantropa, 
  most popular would be puntigamer and ottakringer . 
  best beer is heavy debatable , my personal favourite is stiegl paracelsus-zwickl and hirter 1270 . 
  but there also many good micro-brews . 
  the oddest beer would be samichlaus, 
  limonade is general used for all carbonated soft drinks nektar is juice with water and sugar verd\u00fcnnungssaft / dicksaft ( my favourite word ) is syrup `` gespritzt '' means with carbonated water ( kinda like the german schorle ), 
  yeah same here , the goverment buildings fly both flags ( or 3 when it 's a state building ), 
  it 's actually the [ `` wrong end of the oneway road '' - sign ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/vorschriftszeichen_2.svg ), 
  well , yeah you could see that this way, 
  the fat horses with horns, 
  czech , hungary and strangely from the baltics, 
  well you can say about the swiss what you want , but you must admit their flag is a big plus, 
   i wondered why do n't all the migrants just take a plane , legally , with their international passports , ** visas ** and other documents , and land wherever they want that 's the problem , they need one in advance and wo n't get one , and the airline do n't let you board without one . 
  i do n't doubt there are people who use fake passports/visas but forging a document is harder for the traffickers than buying an old boat, 
  landscape is also nice, 
  there are some museums ans zoos where it 's banned , basicly because people did stupid things with it in the past . 
  also at sport events it could be banned because the theoretical use of it as weapon, 
  schnitzel and beer is well liked . 
  it seems dirndl and lederhosen is getting more common lately, 
   but sometimes people do n't have separate engagement ring ( s ) . 
  instead , they wear their wedding rings on their left hands and at the wedding ceremony they move it from the left hand to the right hand . 
  this tradition i 'm familiar , i do n't know anyone who used an seperate engagement ring . 
  yes , i always thought when there is talked about `` the ring '' it 's the wedding ring , could have been also the engagement rings . 
  not really cities , more like regions , but nobody likes vienna ( `` wasserkopf '' ) and vienna likes nobody ( `` provinz '' ), 
  do n't worry the cent coins would be stamped with camillas face, 
  well , it 's community depending , my town have own , the city i lived before had the yellow bag, 
  at a quick look on ebay i saw a german set for 12 $ and an irish for 20 $, 
  is there a story behind your knowledge of the amount of this specific fine ? 
  it 's keeps the whole currency fluctuation game out of the trade with the important trade partners . 
  austria had this in his schilling days too , 1 dm was always aprox 7 schilling , the trade with germany was ( and still is ) a important part of our economy, 
  there is bin for mixed thrash , a bin for plastic and one for paper . 
  there is also a optional biowaste bin , but i 'm using a composter instead .
