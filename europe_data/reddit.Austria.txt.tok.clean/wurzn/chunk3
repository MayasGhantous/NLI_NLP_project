  we also did n't unite with parts of our country which were under sovjet influence for half a century . 
   moreover , some professions seem to be able to get higher wages in austria than in germany . 
  nurses have a far better wages here but doctors are better off in germany, 
  albeit i did n't hear that a long time : mundl-montur , after a famous tv character, 
  basically it 's very stressful but low paid work , even lower when you get a `` free '' little chamber to sleep . 
  ( and that 's when you work for a unshady boss ), 
  well , that 's depending when and as what you see austria as a country if you see the from the duchy of bavaria indenpendent duchy of austria as the beginning , it would be it 's duke [ heinrich ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/henry_ii,_duke_of_austria ) if you mean the history of the land where austria is now , i think it 's king cincibilus of the celtic [ regnum noricum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noricum ) who was mentioned by the romans and established good relationship with them, 
  interesting , in what aspects do you think ? 
  staying in germany always seemed liked better pay with lower cost of living , but i stayed only in the richer parts for a longer period, 
  i guess there is n't a nation where the whole population is equal rich . 
  many germans are working here at the skiing hotels ( because it 's shit work nobody right in mind do it voluntarry ) , that makes us not richer than germany, 
  ca n't really say it too , i only know the elderflower-melissa syrup i made last year taste a bit like a sprite but half as sweet, 
  no , i was the guy luring girls into old castlre ruins ( only for doing romantic things of course ), 
  the style is different , the irish bread i ate was good too but very different to a austrian rye bread . 
  no , it does n't feel like the country has an awkward relationship with the catholic church , like home ... 
  julius meinl i like the red `` pr\u00e4sident '' roast the most, 
  well , it could be made by either one , both is delicious, 
  is it made of the flowers or of the berries ? 
  well , [ that 's the view from my balcony ] ( http://i.imgur.com/s4ks9y4.jpg ), 
  if you mean the electric assisted bicycles , many older folks use it here . 
  we call all 50cc bikes and scooter mopeds , but term would be only correct for the bikes with pedals . 
  scooters and 50cc bikes are very common here as you can get the license with 16 ( car with 18 ) and it 's far easier and cheaper than the upgrade-able 125cc bike license you can get with 16 too . 
  actual mopeds are getting less and less common , but when i was young the most famous transport option for a 16 year old was the [ puch maxi ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/puch_maxi_p1_xl.jpg ), 
  my fathers work had one , but they changed it to non-alocoholic beer in the 90 's . 
  i really ca n't renember the last time i saw a beer vending mashine ... 
  i was always more a frucade guy , but i drink so few soft drinks today and when then mostly almdudler, 
  interesting , the `` funnel '' of a tornado is called trombe in german too, 
  well , more than 200 in stellaris , but less than 10 in eu , i need some economy tutorial for it , i always end bankcrupt, 
  yeah , but i never said , i 'm good at this games , 
  yeah but it was on sale at gog  i like it , but i did n't have any expections . 
  mostly paradox games , often ck2 and stellaris as they run on my potatoe linux mashine i also try to get into eu4 hyper light drifter is also now on my playing list . 
  i always was a rpg sucker but witcher 2 was my last 3d rpg , and pillars of eternity do n't really clicked with me, 
  nope, 
  `` narrisch auf ihm/ihr '' literally be mad at somebody do n't confused with `` narrisch nach ihr/ihm '' literally mad after someone , which means in love with or more like desire him/her, 
  but it 's cursed and comes with the hypo alpe adria debts ... 
  hey , burgenland has some good wine and fertile ground . 
  tbh i do n't think south tyrol wants back , they would lose autonomy if the became a bundesland or a part of a unified tyrol, 
  some want to give caranthia back to slovenia ^ / s, 
  a cooking show were they do a wiener schnitzel with tunke accompanied with a sachertorte made with nutella, 
  afaik buildings codes are in charge of the bundesland , i know styria had that code and also the house of my parents has one ( albait now it 's just anohter storage room ), 
  the final stage is then watching `` ein echter wiener geht nicht unter '' and understanding everything, 
  yeah , we have some amazing and some very bad ( klippitzt\u00f6rl ) . 
  what ? 
  yes , sharp s is the way to go !, 
  the most prominent ones would be the flaktowers in vienna , anti aircraft emplacement from 2nd ww , which are so solid it 's to expansive and dangerous to remove them . 
  one is repurposed to an aquarium , one to a server farm , and one is too damaged after a munition explosion after the war to use it safely we have also a lot of civil ones . 
  there was a law , abolished in the mid 90s , that every new build house needs an air raid room , so there a quite a few here ( afaik fritzl 's dungeon was also a former one ) we had also one under the school , there was a drill every year were we went down , like a fire drill , but for nuclear incitents ( yeah , chernobyl was still quite in public minds back then ), 
  gas and wood for heating , solar and gas for water . 
  as i use the wood oven only really for autumn and spring i do n't need that much wood , so i either use some trees from my lot , or buy already cutted wood from the neighbour ( i mean why should i do the work manually when he has a tractor with the right attachments ), 
  there is a parade in vienna on our national holiday . 
  though we have a mandatory service and many are n't that enthuastic about our military after serving for it . 
  tbh the view is very mixed , on the other hand it 's well regarded as disaster relieve service, 
  that 's a hard questions pork roast with dumplings and sauerkraut tastes like haeven when made by a skilled cook . 
  [ wurzlfleisch ] ( http://www.radatz.at/fileadmin/_processed_/csm_steirisches-wurzelfleisch_10090b95ee.jpg ) is also one of my favourites, 
  online there is much bad blood about criticizing orban , especially for the border fence . 
  especially after we put also a ~ ~ fence ~ ~ door with side parts at our border, 
  team sport with a league i would say hand ball or ice hockey , first is more played by amateurs , last has more screen time on tv . 
  made some tunke for the wiener ? 
  somehow you are one of the few hungarians online who have good words for austria  at least in rl at the border most people are bros, 
  our relationship with the north-eastern countries could be better and the germans could stop torture our wiener schnitzel , but it 's a quite ok neigbourhood, 
  i would n't say he was highly respected by everyone , many who imho read to much rt hated him because of ukraine and the sanctions of russia, 
  open revolution . 
  obama was also targeted by many political cartoons , like every politicians , but tbh he did n't make it so easy for the cartoonist like trump, 
   before that we used these ones looks like those from lohner, 
  well , burgenland is quite nice , not the typical landscape when you think of austria , but also beautiful . 
  all you need is a nice little wine yard or something, 
  i have , til 3 years ago [ this site has some intersting pics , here the last ride of one of the older styles ] ( http://www.bahnbilder.de/bild/oesterreich~stadtverkehr~strasenbahn-graz/1020434/am-21052017-fand-die-fotofahrt-letzte.html ) [ a better pic ] ( http://www.bahnbilder.de/bild/oesterreich~stadtverkehr~strasenbahn-graz/1020433/am-21052017-fand-die-fotofahrt-letzte.html ) they were quite adventurous to ride , you could hear the relais or somethig switch when accelerating, 
  mostly bombadier cityrunner and staedler variobahn [ here are some nice with special decals ] ( http://blog.holding-graz.at/graz-linien-bim-bunt/ ) there also some austrian produced from sgp and lohner , but they are only used as spare or already decommisioned [ like this one in christmas outfit ] ( http://www.bahnbilder.de/bild/oesterreich~stadtverkehr~strasenbahn-graz/913183/heuer-gibt-es-die-neue-weihnachtsbim.html ), 
  mokka is often made with arabica . 
  a mix of of robusta and arabica is also common, 
  i 'm making it with a bialetti knock off and drink it with a little bit milk at coffee houses i get a melange , that 's more austrian, 
  yeh , i always forget that reddit ca n't handle parenthesis in urls , and strangly only wiki uses them, 
  no , they do n't need to , they have your baptism certificate, 
  if you are catholic the church awaits you declare them your income and pay them a small percentage of it . 
  if you do n't they estimate your income ... 
   knowing people who have wanted to show me that beautiful part of the world rosamunde pilcher ? 
  ~ ~ german west-hungary ~ ~ burgenland it 's mostly agraical and many commuting to othere regions to work good wine region though tbh . 
  : there are pockets of this every in the country , e.g. 
  [ eisenerz in styria ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zr58w7z.png ) is always used as example for rural flight , after the mine and all depending companies closed most younger ones moved else were , so it 's also the `` oldest city '' of austria, 
  for some a real pain in the ass ... / s quite indifferent and on a indiviual base , most do n't like the church tax and the child abuse scandals are not forgotten , but many also highly respected, 
  they are good , i like it on pizza, 
  looking at the prices online it 's cheaper here , sometimes almost it 's cost the half ( yeah , found something which is cheaper here than in germany ) . 
  i 'm living in one of the growing regions and it 's quite available as direct sell at the farmers , for a good quality at a decent price . 
  but it 's still too expensive for use it as everday oil , it 's mainly used as salad oil and for `` seasoning '' . 
  the farmers are quite fond to produce it , it 's a bit more manual labour than with cereals but as the demand is always there they can make more profit with it, 
  it 's good , but i come from the state which has the stereotype to mix pumpkin seed oil with/into everything , but before you did n't try it with vanilla ice someone ca n't argue with us about this topic ... 
  i guess the oil itself is fairly unknown but here and few our neighbour countries . 
  you make it with a special pumpkin cultivar which seeds have no shale/housing, 
  i have three and that 's enough, 
  the town i grew up had a camp every odd year at the old quarry ground . 
  they did exactly nothing , showed up and vanished suddenly . 
  they had no tents , some cars with campers, 
  nothing too unordinary but one thing : [ pumpkin seed oil ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t7ldhmd.jpg?1 ), 
  yeah , i tried to ride everyday to school when i was 16 because bus was always so crowded but when it 's getting really icey in the morning it was n't possible . 
  also in my hometown the used gravel for more grippy roads during winter , you have to be more careful with the brakes then , a lesson i learned that day ... 
  * catan * carcassonne * risk * monopoly / dkt * chess, 
  while living in graz , the newer developments at the outskirts had one lane parking spots and this was also used for motorbikes in the inner city people often parked them on parking spaces ( public or underground ) and put a cover over it . 
  parking garages and spots of underground car parks were often to rent , but quite expensive for my taste . 
  storage units are quite common to rent , but afaik they are only fore storage . 
  but here you could rent a fully equipped garage for some hours , but more fitted for cars then bikes edit : the reply for the deleted comment : [ acc .
