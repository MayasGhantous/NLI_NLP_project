  to this statistics ] ( https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/317323/umfrage/kraftrad-diebstaehle-in-oesterreich/ ) last year 1500 motorbikes ( i guess that counts also scooter and 50cc bikes in ) of [ 500.000 bikes and 279.000 scooters/50cc bikes on the road ] ( http://i.imgur.com/53j0puk.png ) were stolen . 
  fancier and expensiver bikes were usually stored in underground parking spots , brake locks are n't also used . 
  i usually only lock the steering when i park my old bike somewhere . 
   kohtla-j\u00e4rve is probably the worst town there . 
  the mountain looks ... strange ... 
  ice , snow , black ice , salt/gravel and wet leaves on road makes riding from late autumn until mid spring a bit `` adventorous '', 
  `` in stahlgewittern '' from ernst j\u00fcnger is a interesting book regarding this topic , as he writes about his personal experiences through the war . 
  afaik it has also an english publication, 
  it 's only a small percentage , from my class mates nearly all had a 50cc bike , but only 3 of the ride/rode a bigger bike, 
  hey , welcome fellow rider !, 
  motorcycles seen here more as hobby than a serious transportation , or at at least inmature . 
  many get a 50cc license , ride a scooter or a 50cc bike til 18 and buy a car and never ride again . 
  license is a bit complicated , you could get a 50cc or a 125cc license with 16 , a < 35 kw license with 18 which uprades to a full license after 2 years , or a full license with 25 . 
  the license itselfs cost approx 70 % of the car license . 
  also the riding season is n't that long at least here in austria and germany, 
  in my time in graz the local heads of the communistic party , ernest kaltenegger and his political heir elka kahr seemed to be one of few who cared for more than money in their own pocket, 
  so if you about to need 1000 $ you have to pay a fee of 20 $ . 
  if you have an uneasy feel carrying the amount in cash and could n't fully enjoy your trip because of it , i would n't do it . 
  the hunter or ranger feeds the wild animals in winter here bow hunting is prohibited in austria because it 's seen as animal cruelty hunting with guns is no problem here and a hunting rifle is the gun which is thr easiest to obtain, 
  no , i ca n't think of any place fitting this stereotype in austria, 
  kindergarten : 50 elementary school : 300 gymnasium ( grade 5-8 ) : 900 higher technical school ( grade 9-13 ) : 2800, 
  i have a house with a bit over 100m \u00b2 but wiht a lot of 2000m \u00b2 , it 's get a bit to cosy with the children sometimes so i think we add a room or two in near future, 
  i think our bueberries are called bilberries in the us , they are pretty common though . 
  the most dangerous game, 
  hey , i was on krk before the war, 
  oida wos is mit dia ? 
  gehts da no guat ? 
  svalbard ? 
  i hope he did n't get too injured and got better :(, 
  on sip for the car , one sip for the driver ... 
  dogs are often the reason for an attack . 
  the cows are afraid of them ( maybe they think of wolves ) and get defensive and if they think their calves are in danger they would attack . 
  i 've heard you should unleash the dog if you encounter a cow herd , the dow is n't then so brave without your support . 
  also do n't go between calves and adult cows . 
  cows [ that 's no joke ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/07/hiker-gored-to-death-by-cow-in-austrian-alps ), 
  * flex for an angle grinder * hilti for hammer drills/rotary hammer * caterpillar sometimes for an excavator * zippo dor gasoline lighter, 
  they even have the [ the rl mountain ] ( http://www.thetallestman.com/burghauptmannschenk.htm ), 
  well you also have ~ ~ semana santa procession ~ ~ kkk rallies, 
   the vale : austria and switzerland reading the book , i imagined eyrie always a bit like [ hochosterwitz castle ] ( http://imgur.com/alrzm7g ? 
  ) , also because of the many [ gates yo have to go through on the way to the castle ] ( http://imgur.com/a/n1mok ), 
  as kid i always get the cough syrup with a pic of thistle on the bottle which tasted insanly sweet and herbal . 
  i liked the taste back then , maybe root beer is something for me then ... 
  is there still beef because of ~ ~ burgenland ~ ~ german west-hungary ? 
  yeah , the beverage i would say that taste the most like mouthwash is peppermint schnaps, 
  and how does it taste ? 
  like root beer ? 
   has no alcohol and tastes like mouthwash . 
  that 's contradicting, 
  it 's unknown here, 
  when i was a teenager there was a huge aids scare , so at the time everyone i know slept there ways around a condom was used outside a long term commitment . 
  yes , in litlle trays, 
  yeah , we totally not enjoyed your last annexion , no no , we are not into that kind of weird shit , really !, 
  lingonberry jam , works with potatoes and schnitzel not stored , but making fresh if needed : * garlic sour cream * sour cream with herbs * sauce tartare, 
  definitly , but it was not on/off at 9/11 it started earlier , but also was n't viewed so bad immediately after it , my boss back in 2009 went to syria for vacation , nobody batted an eye, 
  i think a growing rift between left and right , especially because of the wedge issue immigration . 
  age pyramid and less than 2 kids per woman will get an overaged society in future . 
  growing distrust in government and his institutions . 
  no , i like the location and that early game as germanic tribes, 
  i like playing denmark in ck2, 
  the collection of the brenner stories from wolf haas der goldene deix, 
  [ it started with this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54o51j/hello/ ), 
  definitly not us, 
  or the nice mexican guy from / r/europe who posted nice greetings and mexican food pics, 
  yes , but it 's schwarzen-egger , a egge is a spiked harrow or it could mean inhabitant of a egg , which is a borough or a small fortification, 
  we blackface usually one of the three wise kings, 
  tasty [ negerbrot ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rddezkz.jpg ) ( = negro bread ) but it 's an very old pic , they changed it to a palm tree later . 
  i 'm not sure it 's in production anymore . 
  it 's chocolate with high peanuts content added, 
  yeah , but at the end of the day you get the same money for the same work and the farmer gets the profits of your work . 
  are n't both `` exploited '' at the same amount regardless how much work the owner puts himself into ? 
   only the large ones . 
  many small local businesses have the owners taking part in the work . 
  does it make it more fair ? 
  to stay at the agricultural topic , what 's the difference between a hired hand for a farmer and someone gets hired by an absentee owner and get 's for the same work the same pay ? 
  it 's that not like that in most companies ? 
  somebody owns the company and reap the profits but other people doing the work for them for an salary ? 
  before the means of production get seized , of course, 
  but for germany i would say alexander von humboldt , he is very beloved in south america, 
  tea and rye bread, 
  it 's uncommon but my great uncle was a semi famous football player so older folks knew it often, 
  there was an accidental one by eon , [ a harmless add at the wrong place ] ( https://approx.antville.org/static/sites/approx/images/eon.jpg ) and this is a bit wtf one [ playing with the idiom `` genie\u00df das leben in vollen z\u00fcgen '' ] ( http://diepresse.com/images/uploads/3/1/f/5247775/berlitz_2_1499349179694154.jpg ), 
  the [ freitag bags ] ( https://www.freitag.ch/de ) are a bit common with the hipstery kind ( or at least were ), 
  [ the eu supports it ] ( http://berec.europa.eu/eng/netneutrality/ ), 
  oh , you mean hershey 's ? 
  / s i know , you can mix any fat with cacao to get an chocolate like looking coating, 
  what 's `` real '' chocolat ? 
  it 's suspicious to state it 's real ... 
  recently i guess it 's the [ kaprun fire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaprun_disaster ) in history ? 
  hard to say , but 1914 til 1945 were n't good years, 
  it has a little different connotation ... 
  keep the sunlight out and the rooms cool during the day, 
  what bush also thrieves and grows without sunshine ? 
  the kampusch, 
  the health ministry here releases annualy a [ good study of the current situation ( sorry , only german pdf ) ] ( https://www.bmgf.gv.at/cms/home/attachments/1/0/6/ch1040/cms1164184142810/bericht_zur_drogensituation_2016.pdf ) an upwards trend in austria could be seen in marjuana and mdma , and `` trial consum '' of `` research cemicals '' , opiates have an downward trend . 
  afaik european wide mdma and heroin/opiates have an small upward trend . 
  it do n't find holocaust jokes funny , my grandpa died in ausschwitz ... . 
  he felt drunken from the guard tower ... 
  moonshine is illegal self distilled alcohol ? 
  it 's legal here for farmers to distill without the intention to sell it , so moonshine is n't that illegal and if you are friends with a farmer or it 's children it 's quite common here, 
  well , uh yeah ...
