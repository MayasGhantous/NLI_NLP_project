  i usually do n't change the jeans daily if they are n't dirty, 
  spas and thermal baths usually offer such massages . 
  graz is quite nice , but i rarely see any international tourists there . 
  ( hey , once i made a phote of a chinese woman and the trams for here ! ), 
  i think our system is a good compromise , the children have to take test to prove the feasable education is granted . 
  the center left and and the center right always get pretty allong , both are n't that vocal about their politics . 
  i 'm curious if that 's also keeps true in future , the new party leader of the center right keeps moving to the far right position in the main wedge issues immigration and refugees . 
  the far right has a very passionated stand on this issues and personally i ca n't think i could be friends with someone who always brings up this with the amount of vitreol . 
  they get quite along with the moderate right . 
  the far left is usually commented with an head shake , and get along with the more left minded of the center left party and it could get very ugly if they met the far right . 
  personally i would get quite annoyed and did n't get along with the more vocal ones that in real life , but on the internet it 's a battle royal ... 
  state care is n't that popular here , my first girl friend was at a `` care family '' , which took two additional kids . 
  that was monitored by a social worker to avoid abuse . 
  the family got money for it and after she moved out she got a `` orphan pension '' while studying, 
  the `` vulgoname '', 
  and you see more austrians there than italians ... 
  i 've seen it at beaches very often ... 
  i 'm fine with people stating their current residency than their nationality in the flair . 
  if you living in that country you can tell from your experience there, 
  the embraer e series is at least in europe often used for short distant flights there was often a embrear e190 as connection flight to frankfurt wenn i used to travel more often, 
  funnily we have the `` italy-fans '' here too , driving around with a vespa with an open face helmet with the tricolori printed on it . 
  also their drinks of choice are either grappa or apperol, 
  fun fact , one dish of our traditional cuisine is `` serbian bean soup '', 
  i 've always thought because of osborne brandy, 
  looking through the answer it seems like europe has trust issues ... 
  we really do n't use the double headed eagle anymore it , because like you said it 's representing austria-hungary . 
  if there is a coat of arms at an old building it likely was n't change since then serbia and russia has afaik still an double headed eagle in their coat of arms, 
  fun fact : a cat is sometimes jokingly called `` roof hare '' because a roasted hare and a roasted cat should look very similar, 
  afaik we do n't hav an official one . 
  often seen as national ones are the golden eagle , the alpine marmot and the chamois . 
  alpine marmot are so cute , if there is a population near a trail chances are good they are quite tame also the european ground squirrel is sometimes mentiones but they are far more common in hungary, 
  the amount of smoking maybe the shops closed on sunday is something often mentioned, 
  i do n't know , germany and our economy are so intertwisted , but neither of us would see each other as ally . 
  other countries do n't really like us too , at least we are n't hated by much, 
   - italians eat cats . 
  i guess this was n't so uncommen in food shortage situation like at the end of the war and some time after eat, 
  yes , but i ca n't renember liking him especially, 
  i 'm seeing many new built housed with one , but it 's not that common . 
  the inflateable pool are also seen sometimes, 
  it does n't ( for now ) but there is a plan if there is another refugee wave , this time from italy , the military would assist the border control, 
  in austria it 's only beef with sauce , but afaik that 's flying under p\u00f6rk\u00f6lt in hungary, 
  yeah , sauce is fine as long there is no coating . 
  [ wiener schnitzel ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/6lmm8i/i_ate_schnitzel_spatzel_kraut_and_of_course_a_beer/?st=j4ttbwkw&amp;sh=5d77469a ), 
  here too, 
  all are very good and diverse [ across the country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_parks_of_austria ) there is also a special park , the [ `` wilderness area d\u00fcrrenstein '' ] ( http://www.wildnisgebiet.at/en/ ) which is closed to public and you could only enter it with a guide , since it 's one of the last places really untouched by humans in austria, 
  it 's a more fluent process than a certain age . 
  your school example , the time we were so long ay school we needed a lunch break , we were allowed pretty much to do in that free `` hour '' . 
  ( i think it was 7th grade , we had saturday school in 5 and 6th grade so the daily school hours were n't too long . 
  play outside alone , well i remember that elementary school was either roaming the streets or the woods and meadows the whole day with the neighbourhood kids or trying to beat mega man or castlevania with a friend . 
  tbh honest the roaming part seem to be lesser common today . 
  i also went to the shops for my parents around elementary school age , strangely i also get beer and cigs for my dad , but that was in a small town and at a `` greissler '' ( think of an oldtimey general store , but specialised at foo ) where wares were all sold `` over the counter '' and there was more trust i also went alone to friends in elementary school age , in elementary school you can also make a `` bicycle license '' were you be taught the traffic rules and you were than allowed to bike on the streets alone . 
  relationships seems to start around 14 , mostly with 16 . 
  there was some minor concerns from the conservatives that van der bellen is an atheist and later from atheists after he went with some other politicans on a pilgrimage . 
  i ca n't think many people will accept a muslim in a major power position here , but it is n't really dicussed because there a very few muslims in politics anyway, 
  it 's usually worn here ( rural area ) at festive events were being in suit/evening dress would be too overdressed . 
  the bosnians i know are, 
  no , but the state issues licenses, 
  whenever i drive by the refugee housing, 
  it was graz, 
  yes , it 's legal . 
  opinions varies , most do n't care, 
  well , if you have to hide it it was n't accepted, 
  well , it should start the labours if the baby is overdue ... 
  it was never really a taboo in my lifetime , even my parents were in a `` wild marriage '' until i was 4 . maybe in the 60s ? 
  yeah , also the small towns around graz are n't really much cheaper ... 
  i loved a lot of cool things were free , like the garden of eggenberg castle or the `` animal park '' of castle lustb\u00fchl, 
  a hare always eat 's my dandelions , i call him my pet jokingly, 
  pickled beets are a common salad . 
  pickled cucumber are thing and there some variants of it ... 
  it 's used in [ rindsrouladen ] ( http://images.ichkoche.at/data/image/variations/640x480/1/rindsrouladen-img-4576.jpg ) , beuff stroganoff is also often here made with additional pickled cucumbers . 
  i use pickled onions as pizza topping ( alongside with pickled hearts of artichoke ) counts sauerkraut also as pickling ? 
  i do n't know , you could find that in every midsized city , i lived a bit in graz and there was plenty to do with the children . 
  but you could find good schools , parks , trails and swimming pools also in rural areas here , only less jobs but cheaper housing, 
  i 've heard of the the phallus but never of the witch , lovely little european tradition now excuse me , the demon costume i use when i threaten noughty children to drag them to hell needs some work and has to be finished before december ... 
  [ acc . 
  to the official site ] ( http://www.aspern-seestadt.at/en ) 2,4 million m \u00b2 area , 20.000 residents and 20.000 workplaces when it 's finished, 
   some also stuff the witches with fireworks when we burn them . 
  wait , what ? 
  yes , at new years eve, 
  [ i 've written a bit about the system here a while ago ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5pw3r1/how_is_the_health_insurance_handled_in_your/dcubywd/ ), 
  simplest way would be insure it in the uk , usually the standard insurence covers most of europe . 
  be sure you do n't forget requesting the `` green insurance card '' , it 's a lot less hassle when something happens and you have it with you . 
  what do you plan with the bike once you finished your travel ? 
  the bike market is n't the best in the second half of the year and as you maybe have pressure to sell it before flying home you may ca n't get a good price for the resell . 
  maybe renting a bike is a better option , a lot less hassle , also with the insurance and registration, 
  yes , and it has two sides , there are the partly state owned casinos with dress codes and beautiful buildings . 
  and then there are the sport betting and gambling mashines in the poorer parts of the towns , most quite an eye sore . 
  i 'm only hearing from the ( small ) communinst party wanting more regulations for gambling , but the big conservative party is heavy involved in the licensed gambling mashine manufactorer so nothing will change in future, 
  besides the generel disprovel of the goverment they were n't particular happy green president was elected but i really do n't know , only that 2 years ago i 've seen far more flags, 
  there is a limited plate with basic insurance and `` best before '' date stamped in available in germany . 
  afaik did n't need to be resident to get it and they are prepaid . 
  these plates are often used to get a vehicle out of country , but i do n't see anything speaking against op use for them edit : they are called `` ausfuhrkennzeichen '' or export plates and you could register them as non-resident , but the coverage is only 3rd party liability and the bike must be bought in germany [ it seems it will cost 450 $ for 3 months ] ( https://www.nondos.de/shopping/ausfuhr/offen-90-tage-3-monate/ ), 
  is there anything else like this in austria ? 
  afaik there is something similar , of course in much smaller scale , planned with the old reininghaus brewery in graz some older projects which came into my mind are [ alt-erlaa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/wohnpark_alterlaa_dachblick_von_block_c1.jpg ) , which is basicly a small city complete with church and shopping mall and [ gasometer city ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/simmering_%28wien%29_-_gasometer_%281%29.jpg ) , which looks quite retro futuristic at the [ inside ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/gasometer-a-by_viennaphoto_at.jpg ) maybe the [ karl-marx hof ] ( https://www.google.at/search?q=karl-marx-hof&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj--oa1ofduahvmvxqkhew3a68q_auibigb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=644 ) as one of the grandfather of such projects, 
  [ seestadt aspern ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/seestadt_juli15.jpg ) is currently in construction at the outer districts of vienna, 
  i guess the worst possible date would be mid april, 
  afaik the old baroness of mayr-melnhof was heavy involved in catholic and the family institutions for christs in near and middle east , so maybe it is n't that far off ... 
  there is a huge parade in vienna and usually the people flag up . 
  but strangely i saw very few flags last year , only the inn and the municipal building in my town had some , despite living in a very conservative area ( i 've my suspicions why ... ) personally i enjoy the day with my family or use it to visit relatives becaus it 's a work free day, 
  cycle rikshaws were introduces some years ago to the city as enviroment and traffic friendly alternative to taxis .
