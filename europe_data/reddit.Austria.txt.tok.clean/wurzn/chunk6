  but tbh honest i do n't want someone slog in the heat for me and sit comfy behind him in the shade so i did n't used them ever, 
  as styrian i would add mayr-melnhof and herberstein, 
  imho tschuschn is generally used for slavs, 
  reminds on our winter sport week , our teachers said no alcohol , but when we went on a bar tour we met our teacher not really sober anymore and they invited us to drink with them ... 
  no , random elderly woman would talk to strangers baby , but never kiss, 
  i love the irish weather but else i 'm quite happy here, 
  my kids even had it in kindergarten ... 
  it depends , hard to beat a `` werksmeister '' but you do n't become this without skill and determination . 
  it 's also hard to beat someone who works `` tax free '' on weekends also as i 've a lot to do with our workshop and they take at least one `` lehrling '' a year and everyone has at least basic english knowledge, 
  i 'm growing several fruits and vegs in my garden , most people i know have at least some fruit trees or berry bushes . 
  i do n't know how that 's compared to north amercia, 
  do n't forget the m\u00f6belixman and hc-man !, 
  basicly they have the same rights to it as `` natives '' s long they fully live here . 
  so when you worked here you have the rights to unemployement benefits and if you pay in the health care system you get fully covered, 
  [ here is a chalcography from 1681 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/vischer_-_topographia_ducatus_stiria_-_229_leonroth_bei_voitsberg.jpg ) the gate is recognisable, 
  the castle was abandoned around 1650 , the residenting family were protestants and had to move . 
  the catholic church owned the castle then but located at a now rerouted trade route it had n't any value and so it slowly overgrown the last 3 and 1/2 centuries the castle is quite old and was several times upgradet , you could see it in the pics there are layers of different style of masonry . 
  located in a disputed area were slavs and magyars invaded/raided often it als was a part of a `` kreidfeuer '' , kind like the signal fire in the lord of the ring movies , warning the people of dangers, 
  there are some easy and scenic hiking routes near the town i grew up . 
  about things hidden in the woods , there is a cool [ overgrown castle ruin ] ( http://m.imgur.com/a/j5ttz ) that not even much people from the town know . 
  germany and switzerland, 
  do `` the streets '' count as hip hop/rap ? 
  was one of my favourite `` non-rock '' formation from uk, 
  i love the early history like the halstatt culture or regnum noricum , though i do n't know if it 's counts as `` my country 's history '', 
  i ca n't really think of such an story for austria . 
  there was the `` potato priest '' who brought some potatos from luxembourgh and indroduced it in lower austria there was the bavarian succession war which was called `` potato war '' by the prussians and `` plum hustle '' by the austrians . 
  basicly the war was declared by prussia and they moved into bohemia but neither side was prepared enough and combined with bad weather there were major logistical problems . 
  there were n't any large scale battle and the `` war '' was stealing and raiding each others food, 
  +1 for graz and the nice but slow route pver the semmering to vienna, 
  up/downvotes seeming generally quite random in this sub, 
  a house at the edge of a forest at the outskirt of a small city a part was build in the 70s , a part in the early 2000, 
  a tax ... 
  yeah , there are good ones , i thinks it 's nearly heresy do admit it , but i like how [ alt-erlaa ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/wohnpark_alterlaa_dachblick_von_block_c1.jpg ) and the [ karl-max hof ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/d%c3%b6bling_%28wien%29_-_karl-marx-hof.jpg ) looks, 
  oh ... that 's happen a lot when i change my mind in the mid of a sentence , i think i wanted to write uncommen but thought that would be a exaggeration ... 
  when i was a little wee skiing camps were popular were you could learn skiing in 1 or 2 weeks and stayed at some alpine huts with many oither kids . 
  thinking of it at the reservoir here was a camp runned by the social democratic children organisiation for children of poorer families where they could do a little vacation for littly money . 
  we did with the school a `` summer week '' where the whole class went to a camp near a lake and could try some sports, 
  that 's what i like \u00f3f the old mid 19th century city buildings , they have such an high ceiling, 
  smoking , we are surely one of the top smokers in europe but it 's getting more and more less common, 
  yeah , i wish we had a better relationship to bohemia and moravia, 
  i 've wrote a bit [ about the situation in austria here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5pw3r1/how_is_the_health_insurance_handled_in_your/dcubywd/ ) if you have further questions just ask, 
  tbh reddit is the first place i 've heard from it and the only thing i 've seen of it are the mems here, 
  my cats were all neutered because i 'm a bird hitler and let them roam outside the half of the day, 
  depends on the age, 
  tbh i loved the small city i grew up , nobody minded we roamed the streets , the creek and the woods . 
  more to do than in `` real '' rural areas but not the hectic of a big city . 
  i 'm reading the `` geo epoche '' magazine , but i 've far to less time to read any `` serious '' things besides what i need for work ... 
  sorry , then it was a misunderstanding , the `` they '' did n't sound like `` my family '' but rather `` those refugees '' . 
  my town has n't one and i consider this as rare, 
  it 's even worse , it 's inconsequent , sometimes it 's one word and sometimes not, 
  neither is true , many bosnian fled to germany and were expelled years later also many bosnian stayed in austria and did n't return, 
  not very common , streets are usually named after their ( often historical ) direction/destination . 
  so names likes wienerstrasse ( vienna street ) , triesterstrasse , linzerstrasse or k\u00e4rntnerstrasse are very common, 
  reminds me on this old copypasta : having chosen english as the preferred language in the eec , the european parliament has commissioned a feasibility study in ways of improving efficiency in communications between government departments . 
  european officials have often pointed out that english spelling is unnecessarily difficult ; for example : cough , plough , rough , through and thorough . 
  what is clearly needed is a phased programme of changes to iron out these anomalies . 
  the programme would , of course , be administered by a committee of participating nations . 
  in the first year , for example , the committee would suggest using 's ' instead of the soft ` c ' . 
  sertainly , sivil servants in all sities would resieve this news with joy . 
  then the hard ` c ' could be replaced by ` k ' sinse both letters are pronounsed alike . 
  not only would this klear up konfusion in the minds of klerikal workers , but typewriters kould be made with one less letter . 
  there would be growing enthousiasm when in the sekond year , it was anounsed that the troublesome ` ph ' would henseforth be written ` f ' . 
  this would make words like ` fotograf ' twenty persent shorter in print . 
  in the third year , publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be expekted to reash the stage where more komplikated shanges are possible . 
  governments would enkourage the removal of double letters which have always been a deterent to akurate speling . 
  we would al agre that the horible mes of silent ` e 's in the languag is disgrasful . 
  therefor we kould drop thes and kontinu to read and writ as though nothing had hapend . 
  by this tim it would be four years sins the skem began and peopl would be reseptive to steps sutsh as replasing ` th ' by ` z ' . 
  perhaps zen ze funktion of ` w ' kould be taken on by ` v ' , vitsh is , after al , half a ` w ' . 
  shortly after zis , ze unesesary ` o ' kould be dropd from vords kontaining ` ou ' . 
  similar arguments vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters . 
  kontinuing zis proses yer after yer , ve vud eventuli hav a reli sensibl riten styl . 
  after tventi yers zer vud be no mor trubls , difikultis and evrivun vud fin it ezi tu understand ech ozer . 
  ze drems of the guvermnt vud finali hav kum tru . 
  in homes very unusal . 
  the last ten years it became a common thing in offices, 
  after that post i had to check you are not the famous / u/kapitan _ manson with his ffod posts in / r/europe https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/56zq2g/good_afternoon_friends_of_europe_traditions_in/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/565s5a/friends_of_europe_good_afternoon_drink_of_the/ https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/557u9w/good_morning_friends_of_europe_classic_drink/, 
  we have this food too and it tastes really good . 
  `` zwetschkenkn\u00f6del '' are also a thing here , but instead of whole plums i prefer the big ones with powidl filling, 
  i guess the biggest difference in culture are between big cities , small cities , alpine rural areas and lowland rural areas, 
  but did the people in the past ? 
  it is , really every public pool i 've visited here is/was top notch . 
  only downsite of this pond is that it was a former gravel pit so the ground mostly is more or less pointy gravel, 
  i think the lack of will to change it is ignorance, 
  every news site ... 
  [ well , there is at least a small pond not far from me ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7stpc6i.jpg ), 
  [ marillenkn\u00f6del ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/fw_marillenkn%c3%b6dl1.jpg ) , i simply do n't like apricots ... 
  and thanks god we could get both here too , 3sat is even a german , swiss and austrian coproduction there are also some good channels hidden in the default channel list , like bayern alpha and zdf info austria has orf3 for culture , and servustv ( owned by redbull owner ) shows also much west austrian local culture, 
  well they thought this too and used it in the [ old rollerball movie ] ( http://pics.imcdb.org/0is238/vlcsnap1546616ni6.1583.jpg ), 
  [ i like the bmw headquarters ] ( https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/bmw-vierzylinder#/media/file:bmwvierzylinderturm.jpg ) if it 's still countsing as modern-day, 
  neil young & crazy horse, 
  interesting , it 's only an subjective observation of mine but here is it a mixed bag on the right . 
  generelly the right wing are pro us gun laws and free speach ( but the far right use it to targeting the laws against hate speech and holocaust denial ) . 
  general there is a dislike against interventionismus and so not very keen of the foreign policy of the states shared trough the whole political spectrum but is very prominent from the moderate to the far right . 
  they mostly liked trump because his campaign promise could be interpreted as attempt to isolationism . 
  mostly because of the near/middle east politics , the far right would prefer autocratics muslim leader that `` keep their people in check '' like hussein and gaddafi and depending how far right you go , the support of israel is and issue in their eyes . 
  and then there is the fringe with it 's conspirancy theories about nwo ( by east coast ~ ~ jews ~ ~ wallstreet bankers ) and us occupied europe, 
  is anti-americanism only a leftwing thing in your country ? 
  the library here supports this with a kind of weird drm, 
  brawls by drunken people are maybe seen and followed usually with instant regrets but the last real assault targeted at police officers i could remember was some years ago when a mental ill poacher went on a killing spree .
