  i know a former professional team here had problems with old debts from shady business and the closed down and splitted . 
  some reformed and started down in a low league and used the former training grounds as stadium and other fusioned with the neighbouring cities only a few kilometers away . 
   in america they exist to make money . 
  if they did n't turn a profit they shut down if they ca n't meet the budget requirements for the league they usually are placed in a lower leage and the team sizes down ,  if the city is not providing them with fans they move to a more profitable city i think this would seen as high treason here, 
  religion by some, 
   also , i thought g\u00f6te was german ? 
  and he lived after holy rome fell i think , so we would n't have been one anymore at the time yeah , and d\u00fcrrenmatt was swiss , tbh i did n't see the `` national '' in the question kafka would be an austrian writer we read , also wolf haas as an example for contempory literature, 
  in half of us states, 
  well we had to know more , the teacher then has to sent again 20 topics beforehand to be approved by the education ministry and to the written final exam we could choose one from 5 ( or 4 ? ) . 
  they were not all books , also write journalistic texts and so on ... now it 's more centralised an the education ministry chooses the same topics for all equal schools, 
  beside goethe we read a lot from d\u00fcrrenmatt , were we the only one ? 
  for styria maybe peter rosegger in the lower classes, 
  they were not standardised before a few years ago , so the teacher could choose a book but faust was one of the topics we could choose, 
  and it 's also not forbidden to sell raw milk here , i only drink that ( mostly because it 's 24h available from the farmer around the corner ), 
  let me give you a hand , you forgot belgium ( ok , it was more private property of its king ), 
  the great leader speaks all languages, 
  hard to say , we like to complain and paint things black, 
  why is there so much fuss about turkish/austrian double citizenship when it 's not illegal ? 
  here is no birthright by soil , you get the citizinship of your mother and if the father is austrian you could get the double citizenship when he agrees ( but you have to resign one of them when you turn 18 ), 
  it 's like to travel from a non-eu country to a non-eu country . 
  by car/train is n't so extensive like at the airport but prepare for passport checks at the border . 
  be sure you have the visas if you require one, 
  [ ask mehran karimi nasseri ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mehran_karimi_nasseri ), 
  well , the military was there to show how they would response to an emergency . 
  since we have a mandatory service there is no really need for enlisting pupils . 
  quite popular , we have a [ major league with 12 teams ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_hockey_league ) , thomas vanek trained with the youth of one team ( but never played profesionally before he moved to the usa ) it 's a contentor to the second most popular team sport after soccer , but it 's hard to say . 
  the professional league is more popular than the hand ball league , but semi professional and hobby hand ball is played more often, 
  ( ever shot a russian , every thrust a frenchman , every kick a brit , every smack a jap ) * serbien muss sterbien ( serbien muss sterben = serbia must die ), 
  [ kitzb\u00fchel ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/kitzbuehel_panorama.jpg ), 
  yeah , this and the donauwalzer are the songs which i could connect 100 % to austria, 
  ( is it really necessary ? ), 
  yeah , here friends and relatives come over ( not all at the same time ) and give you little gifts or toys and clothings their children do n't need anymore, 
  we do have thanksgiving but celebrate it differently, 
  [ radetzky march ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afm9pv8rypq ), 
   but people just like another reason to get drunk , i guess . 
  as we need one ... 
  i mean i know an `` american bar '' which sells burger with side dish for 8 $ but they are much larger than big macs , so it 's ok for me, 
  i have a wife and relatives from an eu country , friends and coworkers from other eu countries , casually drive monthly to another eu country sometimes only to take a shortcut through it , usually make vacation in eu countries and finally work in an company that exports and have sites in the whole eu regards my feeling , which are pro eu , my life is heavily influenced by the eu . 
  not that everything would be impossible without it but much more an hassle . 
  but i see co workers and relatives that are in similar position like me ( but the wife ) and shitting on the eu ... 
  - fire drill - nuclear emergency drill , basicly like the fire drill but rather outside we gathered in the bunker under the school we had also some `` civil guard '' days were military , firefighter and paramedics are in school and did little demonstration ( i renember mostly the firefighter one , the showed what happened when you try to take out an burning oil in a pan with water ), 
  strange , we had the war in the lower classes at the gymnasium and far more indepth at the htl . 
  combined it was sure 2 whole years ... 
  where did you go to school ? 
  it 's far more then 10 years for me and ww2 was a major recuring theme in history , even in the `` htl '' where history is n't such a serious subject . 
  although , from the deep south we also did n't visited any kz, 
  i know , somehow was late yesterday and thought about the british isles ... 
  sorry , i know you do n't like be shuffled to the brits , i even visited you a far too long time ago, 
  interresting , i came to that question because i also do n't think im very representive of my country and funnily i think fellow users i tend to disagree are far more than i. 
  i 'm not but my children have a double citizenship and the amount of comments like `` at least the right kind of foreigner '' dissapoints me a little bit, 
  they are all more travel-docs , and i 've surely seen more docs myself but i ca n't find them on youtube, 
  these were broadcasted on german tv , strangely i 've found more about scotland and ireland then england england : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aosfipipquq scotland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfrm4pymlnm https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btfj5nf57yq ireland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg0dlisvadq https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfavu_9uhqk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbhgfmplgza, 
  beer for sure , but sadly those are most popular are often the most avarage tasting ... 
  nearly everyone sees the things we 've done in the 2nd ww and before as part in of the 3rd reich as bad . 
  but also austria presented itself a long time after the war as `` first victim '' as nobody was willed to help us against a very possible german invasion . 
  many who was n't too much involved into regime used this as kind of apologie . 
  how do you evaluate which one is the best ? 
  and then they eat wiener schnitzel with sauce too !, 
  meat from the local farmer, 
  on the other hand it 's pretty mild compared to what a slowenian coworkers says about croatians . 
  i wo n't say it 's impossible but experience is highly valued , you will have a hard time finding someone preferring a newcomer to someone with some years in the field, 
  i hear it also often ironical used as self description , a bit like like `` nigga '' in the states, 
  negative , but maybe town/village counsile . 
  the lower positions ( and teacher ) are accused to be lazy and spared by the harsh job market . 
  the higher positions are seen nepotistic cesspool and staffed by politicians relatives and as reward for serving them for the first accusing i can say i had often positive experience but the few negative ones are fitting . 
  the second accusing is sadly also true sometimes, 
  i did n't heared anyone calling eastern european a slav . 
  `` windisch '' is an old word for it not used in everyday speech , but it sometimes survived in village names near the border ( or over the border ) , it comes from the tribe of the wends . 
  however `` tschusch '' for slavic and `` yugo '' for people from former yugoslavia is sometimes used as a slur . 
  well , here it 's 130 for a well maintained autobahn or highway like road and suprise , suprise , many people is this still to slow ), 
  there are tons of famous actors born in the austrian-hungary empire , but i do n't know if that counts as cheating, 
  [ south burgenland ] ( http://hikeandbike.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/herbst-s%c3%bcdburgenland.jpg ) looks more like the shire . 
  but i 've always thought of the shire when i saw old pics of m\u00e4hren, 
  is coffee a good comparson ? 
  the big brands are priced from 2,5 to 7 $ for 500g grounded coffee, 
  i was in my late twenties when we had our first child . 
  was a bit weird because every other parent i met was either a teenager with an `` accident '' or in their late 30s or early 40s, 
  was n't so different here , without soviet envolment, 
   it was common to have children that young until the late soviet era . 
  was there any particular reason ? 
  like vailability of contraceptions ? 
  in their mid-twenties, 
  for people who know austria mostly because of it 's alps and vienna whole eastern and northern austria maybe suprising , but [ burgenland , especially the northern part ] ( http://www.austria.info/media/17083/thumbnails/weinbaugebiet-jois-burgenland--o.jpg.3153087.jpg ) deos n't look very alpine, 
  sadly there is n't such an variety here available ... mushrooms and elderflowers/berries are more common here for picking in the wild, 
  they are a bit cheaper than the supermarket here . 
  most are for strawberries and a bit less common flowers . 
  well , we were uncool then ... 
  yeah , damm is also called the wall that holds the water back, 
  but i think bahndamm is more common, 
  the german `` wall '' has the same meaning , also the trains run on a `` bahnwall '', 
  lady gray and oolong, 
  yeah , kinda , it grew with his life-long and ugly feud with simon wiesenthal, 
  [ gastarbeiter ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastarbeiter ) during the economical boom they had to to few workers and signed a bunch of deal with european nations and turkey for easier access to the job market, 
  after the finals at `` high school '' we all already wore suits as the oral exam has an unwritten dress code . 
  took a official picture and then went to the next bar . 
  but we have a big ball before the graduation where the male students wear dark suits and the female fancy white dresses . 
  depending who you ask the answers is both times bruno kreisky , the main reason is his social and finance politics , a famous quote is : `` a few billion national debts causing me far less sleepless nights than additional hundred thousends unenmployed '' under him welfare , workers rights but also national debts hugely increased , but later he also introduced a capital gains tax to do n't let the debts go to high . 
  so conservative people really do n't like him and he is praised by the left, 
  when they are going to secede ? 
  styria for sure , it 's simply the short form of hawara,
