  yeah , but it 's often brought here as example that parts of europe has no free speech . 
  yes, 
  ok , i guess there is then something lost in translation , i 'm pretty sure we call the community of protestant churches here `` evangelische kirche '',

  well , it was each 1 month real work ? 
  we had to do two during school , so i did one as repair mechanic at a glass foundry and one as electrican at the city municipal works . 
  both were interesting , suprisingly the electrican was a bit more exhausting as i was assigned to the outdoor team and most work was laying ground cables and removing the old land lines . 
  both paid quite decent for the time,

  the benefits are better today compared to what my parents got , and they had it better because as miner there was more support from the union and the health insurance than for the average worker i think it 's mostly because more acceptable today to do n't have one , and do n't understand my wrong , i think that 's good . 
  i really only ca n't hear the lack of benefits argument against children anymore , because when some immegrants have kids they are always accused to only have kids because of the benefits but the same people are always saying there are not enough for them to be able to have kids .

  adult theme park , at least the strip, 
  at least they have the ( former ? ), 
  focus on mining and heavy industry common, 
  well since the last general election it 's sometimes called the blue heart of austria ... 
  i really thougt hard if there is a more positive nickname , but i do n't think so . 
  too bad , graz is n't that bad, 
  pegida called it that way in a positive manner , else it 's only called that way when the fp\u00d6 has a good results , but not meant honestly of course . 
  `` verbots-haupstadt '' is also mentioned sometimes because of the mayors politics, 
  graz is sometimes called `` mur-metropole '' but more in a mocking way ( mur is the river of graz ) a darker nickname and former title is `` stadt der volkserhebung `` , which it got because people were very eager to get rid of the opposition after the anschlu\u00df,
