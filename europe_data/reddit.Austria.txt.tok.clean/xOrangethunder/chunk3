  many of those people start a ` lehre ' which means they 're practically being taught by an employer in their future trade while they also have technical lessons in school like institutions . 
  a ` lehre ' usually takes 3 years and at the end of that they have to sit through practical and technical exams akin to matura exams . 
  not knowing english does n't mean they 're automatically uneducated , there 's other things you can be educated in ... 
  i 'm not surprised by the answers so far , but i beg you guys , think outside your little bubble . 
  i assume more then 90 % of the redditors on this subreddit have received some form of broader , higher education but not everyone has followed that kind of path . 
  especially here in austria we 've got many people who chose to learn a certain trade instead of going for the matura and therefore speak english really badly and probably seem uneducated in your eyes . 
  but in reality those people just do n't need to speak or know english , neither for their profession , nor for their life . 
  i did n't know such a thing existed until now and i 'm quite certain most do n't know of it either, 
  nope , such things really do n't exist in big parts of europe , so when it gets really hot , you 're just lying there in a puddle of sweat trying to survive with your little tricks to keep you cool . 
  13 \u00b0 c here and raining, 
  nothing balkans stronk, 
  austria in the balkans ? 
  would n't know , there 's maybe a hotel or two that have more than 13 floors, 
  :'( you know , we 've got nice clear lakes nearby, 
  honestly , i 'm quite content with innsbruck . 
  it 's nicely located in the midst of the alps , has a great infrastructure , lots of activities to do . 
  i 'd probably stay here , or any other similar city in the mountains . 
  kiosks do n't rely really exist in austria, 
  unless you want greater germany to happen , r/de is not your country 's subreddit, 
  hmm , i never had troubles understanding them, 
  well it 's a lot easier to access lowland rural areas than to access alpine ones , so they had more contact to bigger cities which meant more communication and their dialect hot r influenced more, 
  skiing doe, 
  really uncommon to wear your universities clothes here where i live . 
  i rarely ever see someone wearing something of the like and i do n't even know where you 'd get those clothes from . 
  theres a few i really like and as i do n't have a favourite , i 'm just gon na go ahead and mention one that hasnt been mentioned on this thread . 
  wolfmother, 
  but unfortunately it has the viennese, 
  guess you found me out : ^ ), 
  or just anywhere in the mountains that 's either connected to tourism or is somewhat far away from a bigger city . 
  there 's loads of germans and italians . 
  after that it 's asians and since i do n't speak any asian language i ca n't really tell them apart so i dont know which nationality they are . 
  i personally do n't know any citizens that dont speak german , however my mother used to tell me stories about , when she still worked at a court , certain immigrants , after living up to 10 + years in austria , still couldnt speak a word german . 
  this is something i really ca n't stand . 
  other than that every now and then there 's a student from a certain nationality that tells me to learn ` proper german ' even though he 's a foreigner studying in innsbruck , which is something that also triggers me greatly . 
  every 3rd song or so on the radio, 
  could it be regional ? 
  it might be that eastern austria has more . 
  1 of the lactose intolerants is from hungary . 
  i dont think that its common at all . 
  i know 2 people that have it and neither is a native austrian . 
  [ zillertal bier ] ( http://cdn.agrarverlag.at/imgsrv/to/mmedia/image//2010.01.12/1263306706_1.jpg?_=1282738312 ) [ starkenberger bier ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/4a/3f/e8/4a3fe8c5e619ad0375a7e788e80f61e3.jpg ) i do n't have a 3rd favourite one . 
  practically none, 
  oh right , my bad, 
  that only happens in upper austria, 
  basically yeah , except for the sitting down part and different gathering places . 
  the only one we had was the fire drill , thats it . 
  even though my grandpa on my mother 's side apparently is from sicily ( never met him ) , everything else related to me is 100 % austrian and that 's exactly what i look like . 
  sell woll . 
  well , clearly not, 
  if by ` german wiener schnitzel ' you mean schnitzel with sauce , then props to you for eating it like it 's supposed to be eaten , unlike most of your german countrymen, 
  in germany i 've been mistaken for a swissman : ^ ), 
  dreamhack is a gaming convention in sweden, 
  people usually say austrian german sounds a lot smoother than standard german , but that does n't apply to my kind of austrian german . 
  where i 'm from everything is a lot harsher , to the point where i 've already been mistaken for a swissman when i was in germany . 
  the reason for that is , that every ` ch ' we pronounce is not the soft ` ch ' you 'd find in words like ` ich ' , but the harsh one in words like ` ach ' . 
  so every ` ch ' sound is made at the back of the throat . 
  the same goes for every k we pronounce . 
  number 2 and 3 are disqualified by default , for obvious reasons . 
  i 'd be with you if that happened, 
  absolutely not , fuck federalising, 
  the common austrian greeting ` servus ' actually ment slave in latin . 
  here it 's also called ` ochs am berg ' . 
  penne ? 
  you can probably find them if you look for them , but i havent ' t seen them so far . 
  most common in eastern austria maybe . 
  hearing it in western austria , said by a local , is like finding a unicorn . 
  austrian german : b\u00e4rig , gfiarig , l\u00e4ssig and gewaltig those are the ones that come to mind instantly, 
  hawara is exclusive to eastern austria though . 
  we 've also got ` moaschta ' though . 
  and for multiple people there 's ` manda ' and ` burschn ' . 
  you forgot ` neuner ' which you eat , as the name would suggest , in the morning at around 9 to 10 . 
  i do n't know if its all that healthy if you think about the sleep deprivation i have from getting up that early . 
  please tell me you 've actually tried tyrolean brand beers like zillertal bier or starkenberger . 
  you do n't really find those that easily unless you know where to look . 
  the ones you do find easily and you probably had are the mainstream ones like zipfer , g\u00f6sser , paulaner and schwechater which are n't tyrolean and , especially the latter two , are very bad . 
  usually my bike ride at 5:30 in the morning to catch the bus wakes me up, 
  not quite . 
  we speak a bavarian dialect with alemannic features, 
  i think in austria we should also adopt that letter . 
  i 'm pretty sure theres more \u00e5 's then there are a 's in everyday speech, 
  generally ` von ' is regarded as nobility , but in austria we dont officially have nobility anymore and i personally havent met anyone with ` von ' in their name to this day, 
  interesting , among the many words i 've never heard of there 's also ones that are incredibly similar to what i 'd say in my dialect . 
  for those words i 'd use ` lackn , butzn , milchdischtl and scherzele ', 
  why especially hotels ? 
  they 're found everywhere just like any other drink, 
  just pronounce the th like an f. 
  huh ? 
  you 've never been to western austria if you really ca n't hear a difference between our g and our k. 
  in my opinion , no . 
  most people would rather go down than join germany . 
  vienna being the capital wouldnt work either , since it 's greatly disliked all over austria . 
  ** e d e r ** ** d ** # # ** e ** ** e ** # # ** d ** ** r e d e **, 
  maybe if the country trying to anschluss were a good country : ^ ), 
  not at all . 
  i 'm not even sure it 's being offered where i live . 
  maybe in the 6 hours away vienna , but even if , i 'm pretty sure it 's a niche there . 
  same here . 
  you pretty much described it perfectly, 
  innsbruck is the self proclaimed capital of the alps, 
  the only way i 'd use that expression is to explain something in simpler words .
