  but obviously not everyone in vienna is like that . 
  why do so many people drive to vienna ? 
  because people want to see with their own eyes if god really created that many idiots . 
  had english lessons since first grade middle school , but learned all of it pretty much on the internet . 
  not in austria, 
  hmm , i ca n't really think of anything special about german in general . 
  * but in my local dialect ( and all of austria for that matter ) we often let germans pronounce the word ` oachkatzlschwoaf ' ( squirrels tail ) and always get a good laugh out of it . 
  * another thing that 's a bit more region specific , i think , is that where i live we use double negatives even though they do n't exist in standard german . 
  in most sentences with a ` kein ' ( which does n't really have an english equivalent but translates roughly to ` no ' ) we add another ` nicht ' ( not ) at the end . 
  oh i did n't know that . 
  til , 
  i guess google translate missguided me a bit then , cause i didnt hear the \u00fc in kyss , but yeah , close enough . 
  i do n't know how a native speaker would pronounce it , but ` kyss ' according to google translate sounds to me like ` schiss ' and not tsch\u00fcss . 
  schiss on the other hand would means something along the lines of ` afraid ' . 
  to have ` schiss ' -  to be afraid . 
  huh , that 's interesting . 
  it meaning foreign has probably something to do with us calling the province of trentino in italy ` welschtirol ' . 
  i mean , you can come over and leave your money there . 
  as long as you do n't complain about our superiour language . 
  may i direct you towards k\u00f6tbullar and how the k turns into an sh ? 
  ( and that 's just the tip of the iceberg ), 
  ^ it 's ^ called ^ fleischkaas * ^ cough ^ cough *, 
  not at all really . 
  6 lessons a la 50 minutes means the school ends at 13:30 . 
  just that one day was a little draining . 
  it would n't look very nice . 
  brits just do n't know how to drink, 
  in tirol there 's 2 variants , either - a or - r . you can be a tirola or a tirolr , depending on where you 're from . 
  except for the day with the 10 classesthere was no lunch . 
  we 've always had the breaks to eat and on that on day we had 10 classes we could leave the school premises until classes started again , which was after about an hour or so , ca n't really remember exactly . 
  jealous has just acquired the new meaning of ` puking the whole stomach out ' . 
  fucking germans, 
  we 've had 4 days of 6 classes \u00e1 la 50 minutes and one day with 10 classes . 
  breaks were usually 5 minutes long except for the break between the 3rd and 4th class which was 15 minutes . 
  on the day with the 10 classes we had an hour long break . 
  it 's the left shoulder at least in austria and apparently if your nose itches then someone is thinking about you, 
  in tirol this superstition also exists , however it 's not just white clothes and the apartment/house has to be tidy , otherwise something bad happens . 
  and the spirits are called wuzelen ( little ones ) here . 
  or better , dj \u00d6tzi - anton aus tirol, 
  well , you forgot the most simple ones , fangelex ( tag ) and fuassballn ( playing football ) . 
  besides that , i used to play the same games with different names though . 
  first game you described we called ` ochs am berg ' and he had to say ochs am berg auf der gr\u00fcnen wiese . 
  then vaschtoanate hex . 
  schwarzer mann stays the same hide and seek we called ` opeckn ' because you could free yourself as a hider by running to the place where the seeker was counting and by saying ` oans , zwoa , drui < name  opeckt ' you would n't have to seek next round . 
  same goes for the seeker , if he sees someone he needs to run back to where he counted and say the same thing with their name . 
  and for the last game we 'd never say gendarm but gendi ( schandi ) . 
  i found the picture where it supposedly lists the most common surnames of europe . 
  m\u00fcller is germany as far as i know, 
  yes , after all in both switzerland and vorarlberg they speak an alemannic dialect . 
  unlike everywhere else in austria , where you 'd speak a bavarian dialect . 
  however tyrolian still sounds different to the other bavarian dialects due to the influence alemannic had on the bavarian in tyrol . 
  what happened to the pronunciation of the `` k '' in vorarlberg ? 
  in switzerland and liechtenstein its always pronounced very rough and so is it in the neighbouring province of tyrol , but vorarlberger for some reason pronounce it softspoken . 
  sure , we could also turn the table and say the opposite though haha, 
  i knew that , thats why i wanted to beat people that think that to the punch : ^ ), 
  anything from eastern austria . 
  ca n't speak for whether it 's true or not , but it 's not racist if it 's the truth . 
  we usually only have 2 ways of greeting someone , both mean the exact same thing and you normally use 2 greetings for whatever reason . 
  same with saying goodbye , you also use 2 different words to say goodbye . 
  ** ` servus , grias di/enk ( plural ) ' ** and then either ** ` wia tuats da/enk ' ** ( how are you . 
  how does it do to you ) or ** ` wia geats da/enk ' ** ( how are you . 
  how goes it ? ), 
  last name would be ` gruber ' . 
  i 'm not sure about the first name though , maybe ` michael ' . 
  except for parts of tyrol and all of vorarlberg , which speak alemannic dialects , every other part of austria speaks a bavarian dialect , some more some less . 
  it 's pretty much only dying in big cities because of globalisation and how people from all over the world , but msotly europe , specifically germany , move to them . 
  take my city for example , innsbruck . 
  we 've got roughly 130000 citizens of which 30000 are students at the university , that 's of course a heavy influence because of how many foreigners are there and they obviously do n't speak the local dialect . 
  however out ouf those cities and their surroundings the dialect is pretty much still flourishing . 
  but yeah , there is 0 promotion of our dialects which is very sad especially if you look at switzerland who have fully acknowledged their language and incorporated in tv and media . 
  i personally believe we should also do something like that . 
  because it resembles the sound the best . 
  standard german does n't have that sound , but south german dialects like bavarian and swiss german do . 
  the word ` awe ' would resemble the \u00e5 sound very well in english , in my opinion . 
  you 're forgetting about / r/nordvei, 
  i kun da dazehln wea sell tuat ... 
  so keats sis jo o in sellem subreddit . 
  not sure , but i believe the germans reserved that one for themselves . 
  but i usually just say ` servus ' when getting called, 
  hmm it instantly tells me that i need a premium account, 
  sooo , without a premium account i ca n't see that statistic ? 
  i meet more honhonhons than jajajajas tbh . 
  xaxaxas are also common but the rest not so much . 
  good luck finding austrians online ( excluding reddit ) . 
  when i was in germany for a weekend last year that happened to me as well . 
  i was normally talking to my friends on the bus and the tram and multiple people kept looking at us weirdly , which was probably because we were talking in our local dialect to each other . 
  one time an older women came up to us and asked whether we were swiss because of our rough pronunciation . 
  she was totally confused when we told her we are from austria cause according to her we did n't have the ` melody ' : / but yeah , i believe they 're just curious . 
  there 's quite a bit variation in the german language area . 
  i actually translated a prose on / r/translator about 2 weeks ago into my local dialect . 
  er nimmpm goggl zuam trainer . 
  `` du h\u00e5sch mein suppo kampfvogl zasteat ! '', 
  pleat da m\u00e5nn in trainer un . 
  die anderen kampfv\u00f6gel werden einen einzigen blick auf ihn werfen und sofort davonlaufen . ``` and that 's just the tyrolian dialect , if you go east , north or west you 'll find completely different variations . 
  i 'm just not gon na count kebab stores cause they 're no supermarkets . 
  but in my city there 's a few turkish supermarkets sprinkled here and there , they 're called \u00d6lmez . 
  i 've never been in them ( neither has anyone i know ) , they 're like little turkish ghettos , if that 's even the right word . 
  currently a tie between two songs . 
  yeah , never . 
  i have n't seen a picture of the federal president in my primary school or the gymnasium i went to ever .
