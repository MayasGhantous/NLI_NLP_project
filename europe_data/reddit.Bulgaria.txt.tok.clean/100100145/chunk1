huh , did n't know that . 
  the real image is not any less scandalous , though , it is less silly . 
  and while i do n't know much about the circumstances in which the second scene was taken , in the first scene i posted the proceedings definitely look like something endorsed by the establishment , with officers and sailors in parade uniforms standing guards . 
  the central character in that scene is a leader of a biker gang , endorsed by the president himself , as well as a cavalier of the order of honour . 
  i would definitely call that person and the people he leads part of the political establishment . 
  definitely not freaks in any case . 
  edit : fixed some clunky phrasing . 
  well , before falling out of grace some prime minister of a novorussian republic mentioned it . 
  and considering that in russia scenes like [ that one ] ( http://pravoslavye.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/80775628.jpg ) or [ that one ] ( http://www.nova-lan.ru/uploads/news/2015/february/07/2acc2d058159573d74628306abd672d4.jpg ) do n't shock anyone , do n't cause a scandal and do n't seem to damage the church in any way ( which would most likely be the case in most of the orthodox world ) , i 'd say there is definitely a movement amongst the russian political establishment that can accurately be described as red orthodox . 
  as an influential russian political scientist has said :  all corruptioon can be divided into 2 parts -- patriotic corruption and unpatriotic corruption . 
  or said differently `` eurasian corruption '' and `` euro-atlantic corruption '' . 
  so it seems corruption is ok , as long as it 's patriotic enough . 
  even before there was russia really . 
  my high school biology teacher was still convinced that hiv is man made . 
  because often times it 's the same people doing the different things . 
  russian establishment figures have been known to refer to an `` red orthodox project '' . 
  a deputy in parlament legally receives 2700 levs ^ [ 1 ] a month . 
  in comparison the average wage of a programmer is around 2600 ^ [ 2 ] . 
  companies are quite willing to pay managers wages greater than 10 000 levs ^ [ 3 ] , while the prime minister gets only 4473 . 
  no matter how you look at it , the legal salaries of politicians are not some kind of standard of opulence .

  not really . 
  the end result is that the only people that would run for elected office are those that plan to supplement their income unlawfully . 
   3k is some parlament level shit to be honest the lawful wages of elected officials are well known to be ridiculously low . 
  quite a large part of the professional class gets more than that . 
  they have abided by the ceasefire , they will abide by the peace . 
  i 'm pretty sure the kremlin 's political technologists could spin that in a manner that would make putin look good . 
  it could be like a heroic epic . 
  elton john would like orpheus , putin would be king of the underworld . 
  it could be that putin has now realized how damaging diplomatically the whole thing is , and called elton john to have a conversation that will `` change his mind '' . 
  that way he could remain the strong independent leader who never succumbs to western pressure . 
  in libya there has been a ceasefire for more than 6 months now , and both of the major warring factions are negotiating a permanent peace . 
  syria 's 3 way civil war is as intense as ever . 
  in iraq the islamic state 's advance has largely been halted , they have even lost territory . 
  in syria they are still largely on the offensive , having taken over * half * the country . 
  to compare a country as fucked up as syria with afghanistan is just silly . 
  iraq and libya may not be in a nice state but comparing them to syria makes a good argument for western intervention . 
  did he ? 
  last time i heard anything about that assad kept a portion of them . 
  he did say there ought to be a maximum wage . 
  i do n't see how that is not his stated position . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  the reason why hezbollah is seen by many lebanese as a source of protection is the legitimate institutions of that country are very weak . 
  and it is no secret that hezbollah has been making sure they remain weak . 
  they might have their own political party , but they are an islamist paramilitary organization and inventors of the suicide bombing at that . 
  i think you misunderstand the point of ousting assad . 
  the thing is , that it 's impossible to defeat the islamic state , without a strong syrian army . 
  and the syrian army with never be strong with someone like bashar as its commander in chief . 
  not really , the idea is to have put syrian army under the command of a competent leadership . 
  it does n't matter if it 's the vice-president or a military junta , it would be better than hafez al assad 's idiot eye doctor son . 
  were there really mass deaths ? 
  everything i can find about that affair says there was only 1 casualty . 
  and anyway , if domestic peace achieved trough government cooperation with the far right is your thing , i implore you to enjoy it , while you can . 
  much , much worse than iraq . 
  is , for example , has been far more successful in syria , compared to iraq . 
  and it 's only going to get worse , really . 
  how can things get better in a country where the president 's relatives can murder high ranking military officials and get away with it . 
  well , considering that syria is in a far worse state than any middle eastern country , where the west has intervened , i 'd say western leaders may be smarter than you give them credit for . 
  i do n't know about you , but i 'd rather live in a country where the far right is throwing grenades at the central government , rather than [ committing assassinations at the behest of the central government ] ( http://grani.ru/opinion/podrabinek/m.235226.html ) . 
  does it , really ? 
  or is it just a symptom of an underlying disease ? 
  people in general can put up with quite a lot , so i 'd guess many were fine living under assad 's rule . 
  before assad started bombing syrian cities , that is . 
  on the other hand a civil war is the logical consequence of an absolute rule by a man whose ruthlessness is comparable only to his incompetence . 
  he was making a movie reference . 
  so the proof of your remarkably confused claims ( `` they also do n't need to send large size forces to war in places beyond the former soviet union as those places are primary targets if they should ever decide to invade somewhere '' ?!, 
  ) , is a russian success against an enemy that made the strategic decision not to resist them at that point ? 
  care to explain why things are so different now ? 
  why can they send military expeditions in the middle east now , if , as you imply , they were not capable of that feat before ? 
  as you wish , but please can i ask you something ? 
  maybe the russians can in fact send large scale expeditionary forces abroad , but what evidence is there to support that proposition ? 
  has the russian federation dispatched a , say division sized force to war beyond the borders of the former soviet union at any point in its entire history ? 
  you have been claiming that things have changed , please prove that for me . 
  logistics in this case is not a mattet of priorities but a simple matter of geographic realities . 
  it is practically impossible for russia to send troops by land , without passing trough hostile countries . 
  and russia has never been a major naval power . 
  it has never been capable of waging wars far away from its borders . 
  there is no reson to believe they are capable of supporting an expeditionary force in syria large enough to have a decisive influence on the war . 
  the thing is that if the russians tried to pull the same shit they pulled in chechnya ( assuming of course that they are infact logistically capable of doing it ) . 
  the regional allies of the rebellion would massively increase their support . 
  thus if they go for their chechen formula , there is a significant likelihood that they are going to end up with their second afghanistan instead . 
  are the russians even capable of bringing the war to a decisive end ? 
  even if western governments do n't do anything , in their typical delusion that inaction does n't have consequences of its own , regional powers are extremely unlikely to be as passive . 
  and those care far less about who is an extremist and who is n't . 
  once again if we do nothing , things are going to escalate , at our expense . 
  edit : made it more clear . 
  this was the fourth major hostage crisis involving chechen separatists . 
  by that point , it 's pretty unlikely that the russian authorities did n't have a strategy for dealing with that kind of situations , do n't you agree ? 
  because the government had greater priorities than the lives of the people inside . 
  the last time basayev took russian hostages , he managed to use the negotiations for their release to dramatically alter the situation in chechnya to the separatists advantage . 
  but because of the political situation at that time , the government was ready to do anything to prevent that from happening again . 
  when you see russians proclaiming their support for the government , do keep in mind the russian people were cheering for nicholas both in 1904 and in 1914 . 
  nah , as bad as things may be i do n't think we have churches based on pseudo-nationalism , do we ? 
  look , i have neither the time nor the nerves to argue with all of you . 
  but i do want to ask is by why would you call / u/lesserstuff a pro-ukrainian guy ? 
  all he seems to do is arge with other pro-ukrainian guys . 
  the link you are giving us is a forum post that links to a video on youtube . 
  from the 11th of august 2015 . 
  beyond that need i remind you that lostarmor.info is a website set up to support the claim that the people 's republics captured most of their armor . 
  you know , from back in the days when they did n't have the fifth largest tank army in europe .
