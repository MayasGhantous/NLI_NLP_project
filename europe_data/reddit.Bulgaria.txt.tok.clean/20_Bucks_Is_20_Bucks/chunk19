  some people just hate stuff because they want to . 
  well the economy is a major point that needs to be considered ** by ** the people . 
  you cant just disregard it . 
  but yes it is not the only thing that matters , but the way the eu works currently it is still mainly an economic union so of course the drawbacks will be most heavily felt in the uk 's economy . 
  both are quite important so i dont get why you 'd hinder both of them for symbolic nonsense . 
  people need to realise we cant fix the issue even if we took 5 million migrants every year . 
  now they think they are doing god 's work but it is doing much more harm than good to their homelands ( talking about the non-refugees , dont see syria doing much better in the future with assad 's dictatorship surviving the war ) . 
  what is the problem with romanians and bulgarians immigrating ? 
  i think i saw [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpjzfgchgle ) video here first , but it perfectly sums up why europe cant save the refugees and immigrants . 
  weird how the countries who have experienced terrorism the least seem to view it as a bigger issue . 
  like france ( 27 ) being worried less than most eastern european countries like bulgaria ( 38 ) or slovakia ( 39 ) . 
  this also shows how much the migrant issue has backfired . 
  for me 2k migrants ( if i am not mistaken ) for bulgaria is such a small number its a non issue compared to integrating our 100k 's of roma people . 
  i wasnt trying to be offensive . 
  it is a fact that the older generations are much more religious in the whole of europe . 
  old people . 
  without romania i cant tell exactly how bad we are . 
  what ineptitude of the eu ? 
  give the eu less power and then criticize it for not doing anything . 
  in eastern europe it is . 
  for some reason everybody still breaks down every issue in this country to eu/west vs russia . 
  the moment polls show a decrease in eu support they show an increase in russia support and vice versa . 
  as if changing to the euro will do anything . 
  our currency is already pegged to it so we go wherever it goes . 
  also im tired of losing 10 % of my money from exchange rates when doing a europe road trip or when travelling for work . 
  but i guess bulgarians are more concerned with real issues like giving a medal to the incompetent cop who killed an unarmed refugee because he shot his gun under a bridge . 
  ukraine is not part of the economically and politically united europe . 
  if they were there would not be a war there currently . 
  who would 've known that no wars and a politically and economically united europe would prosper compared to having 10-20 wars a century :d, 
  not very equal if the women can decide if the men go to military prison . 
  communism is an ideology of creating equality . 
  you wouldnt want to kill a whole race if you followed communism 's ideals , i.e. 
  it does not teach you to kill people . 
  stalin and mao were not communists . 
  they were authoritarian monsters who did n't value human life and did what they did so they can stay on top not because it was `` communistic '' . 
  i agree that being racist should not be a crime , but thats very different from belonging to an ideology which seeks to destroy a whole race . 
  will a class teaching people to kill the president/pm be legal ? 
  seeing as you disagree with me i feel pretty good about myself  . 
  that is completely different . 
  most ideologies dont have as a pinnacle of their purpose to go through with genocide . 
  someone killing a communist because he is a capitalist is much different than neo-nazis killing jews , the capitalist was not thought to be a communist murderer from reading capitalism 101 . 
  this is not about thoughtcrime or something similar . 
  it is about supporting an ideology which orders the systematic killing of people . 
  i am very against political correctness and the way it is being abused now . 
  but this is not about being offended its about not allowing people to plan and to spread genocidal ideas . 
  id say that following and supporting an ideology that is based on violence against others should be illegal . 
  i love that when i go to serbia i can speak bulgarian and we can mostly understand each other . 
  romanian to me doesnt sound at all like russian 0_0 . 
  i mean it is a romance language it has almost nothing in common with russian . 
   sounds like russian : romanian , portuguese u wot m8 . 
  we like ??? 
  much more for northern neighbours than romania :p, 
  they are 100 % within the modern macedonian region . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_ ( region ) # / media/file : greater_macedonia . png, 
  you are taking this way too seriously as well . 
  the most important thing is to be reasonable . 
  there is no need to expend so much effort and time and money because a name is only 80 % accurate . 
  there are issues that require the effort and then there are issues like this which are the greeks hitting their chests and shouting `` come at us bro , ancient macedonia 2000 + years ago was 300km south of where you are '' . 
  what else would the people call themselves when the nation is less than 30 years old and their only characteristic is the location of the country ? 
  can you think of an alternative to calling the country macedonia that is not entirely fictional ? 
  it is seriously not a big whoop . 
  i think both sides should stop being so immature and just call it macedonia and end this bs . 
  i find it odd that russian supporters believe russian sources but disregard western media for propaganda . 
  which side has its media completely controlled by the government again ? 
  i see your wikipedia page and raise you [ the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/17/eu-imposes-sanctions-21-russian-ukrainian-officials-crimea ), 
  the way there are no russian military forces in ukraine right now ? 
  who is the law and power in crimea right now and especially when the referendum was done ? 
  the russian military . 
  also come on youre asking me to believe in the validity of a referendum where 123 % of the people in sevastopol voted for the russian occupation . 
  show me the source of the german one . 
  and at the end of the day these are just casual polls which can be very easily influenced to shwo whatever the poller wants . 
  a valid referendum is required to prove what the people actually want . 
  several european observes do not make a referendum led and organised by the occupying russian military forces valid . 
  well having the pretext of russia illegally and without a real reason invading crimea and with everything bad they have done in the past 10 years plus their foreign policy currently i am going to go with `` russia bad '' and sleep well at night knowing i made a reasonable statement . 
  maybe i got confused or something . 
  wasnt there a post on / r/europe about corsican independence ? 
  dude it is no longer the middle ages where everybody fought over getting land and castles and shit . 
  i mean i know the russian propaganda is strong but you must realise russia is not gaining anything from this but alienating itself and ruining its economy . 
  it is only for you benefit to stop with this chauvinism and turn to reason . 
  ah thanks i did not know that . 
  i was surprised they 'd post such uncertainties . 
  but the referendums were done after russia invaded . 
  call me too reasonable but i cant believe they are valid at all . 
  and mongolian before that . 
  and ancient greek and roman . 
  most recently it is ukrainian , given to them after the collapse of the soviet union . 
  it legally belongs to them . 
  please take your russian polls and throw them in the useless bucket . 
  ~ ~ shame on forbes for quoting them as if they are a proper source ~ ~ . 
  if a credible referendum is done by a neutral side the world will respect it . 
  ** edit : see reply **, 
  and how do you know that ? 
  and crimea used to belong to its people . 
  now it is occupied by russia illegally . 
  nah see proper statisticians arent really allowed in crimea currently . 
  contribution was questioning op 's calling of the referendum results as `` undeniable '' . 
  or do you really think 123 % of the people in sevastopol voted for the russian occupation ? 
  do they have a valid reason for which they desire independence ? 
  certain lands next to the river volga belonged to the bulgars for centuries . 
  id like them back .
