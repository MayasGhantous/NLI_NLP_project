  people hard-headedly saying no without thinking . 
  makes me think i should just give up on europe and move to the us where people are united . 
  ** edit : ** i am so glad we created a discussion here . 
  too many responses to respond to everybody but im loving the debates . 
  especially since i expected to see this comment in the bottom of the thread with a big + next to it . 
  yup . 
  as if unification would mush everybody 's culture into one overnight . 
  tell all the germans not to vote for whoever they like then . 
  they do however act as if everybody in the world is trying to scare them into staying in the eu . 
  every time there are threads like this one , pulled out of asses in order to drive that narrative people flock to them and start whining how people ( respected political figures that always comment on world affairs mind you ) from other countries are telling them what to do and because of that they will now be voting to leave . 
  therefore there are 2 conclusions . 
  either people do not think there are any negative consequences of the uk leaving the eu and therefore every remain argument which mentions negative effects is lying and trying to scare people , or either because that is a convenient way to disregard valid arguments especially because most of the remain arguments are about negative consequences if the leave vote wins . 
  i challenge you to find a post on / r/europe with more than say 100 upvotes about another leader 's ( or banks or imf or anything really ) pro-remain opinion which doesnt have an asshat complaining about foreign intervention and/or fearmongering as one of the top comments . 
  most of them dont have the money to go back . 
  what then ? 
  an anti-brexit opinion ? 
  scaremongering i say !, 
  do people really think there will be no negatives if the uk leaves ? 
  how do you portray these negatives so that you are not `` scaremongering '' ? 
  this is like calling every pro-brexit argument racist . 
  also bulgarians will compare the country they are in to bulgaria at every chance they have and usually will come up with two conclusions : 1-see ? 
  bulgaria isnt that bad !, 
  2-people/things here are much more civilized than at home !, 
  nobody is saying the opposite . 
  the only reason people are more anti-russia about the ukraine conflict is because they are the aggressor . 
  sweden entering a defensive treaty ? 
  seems like an aggressive move against russia . 
  yeah but what about your sovereignty ? 
  benefited everybody until they borrowed beyond their means and ability to pay it back . 
  then just benefited the countries which werent retarded in the handling of their economy . 
  edit : op 's post was something about germans being robots, 
  in fact greece should be rewarded for showing the evil german scheme of lending money to countries and then wanting them to * pay it back * . 
  soulless monsters . 
  i am a federalist and very much against what you said . 
  the whole concept of a ever closer union is based on creating friendly relationships between nations and working together for a better future . 
  we cant just start acting like assholes because one member decided to leave . 
  whatever happens britain aint moving away from europe , eu or not , we are in this together , so if they leave lets just do whats best for both sides . 
  its pitiful to say that you would feel some sort of gratification if they get punished . 
  the uk is the country to never let large companies and monopolies abuse their people . 
  everybody knows the eu is conservative and never interferes with the free market . 
  oh wait it was the opposite . 
  problem is that when one happens it becomes increasingly hard to control and stop it the longer there hasnt been a fire . 
  fallen trees , moss , etc accumulate on the forest floor and act as the perfect fuel . 
  does anybody else find this kind of tests silly ? 
  * gets sued by every tri-colour flag country *, 
  shaving your genitals lowers the built up of sweat and * other * bodily liquids and increases your hygiene which has the added bonus of you maybe getting laid again after that faithful night during freshers when big bertha let you stick it in her . 
  dont know how correct he is , but controlled logging should be done for all forests in order to weaken the intensity and spread of fires . 
  i think most tricolours are ugly . 
  get on our level . 
  we have been mistrusting them for 2 and a half decades . 
  it is . 
  there are many regulations for obtaining citizenship in any country in europe . 
  and it takes a long time . 
  countries who also happen to be in the eu , not the eu . 
  i thought the lefties were supporting the remain campaign as the eu protects small businesses and people from being overtaken by large monopolies ? 
  can we like unite our anti-corruption bodies so romania can teach us what to do ? 
  i am very happy for romania , but its rather heartbreaking things are remaining the same in bulgaria . 
  what clicked ? 
  how did romania 's anti-corruption body suddenly start working ? 
  why isnt our government requesting more cooperation with the romanians , we can at least learn how to get our shit together as well . 
  well duh . 
  its for debt relief , not for subsidies . 
  so if the us elects trump states should secede ? 
  ** edit : ** double standards at its best . 
  country leader is a dumbass , people dont vote for him again , eu head of commission is a dumbass , better dissolve the union . 
  being a prisoner wasnt a death sentence , at least in the west during ww2 . 
  if you were a german pow you had a very large chance to return home safe . 
  and that was one of the most violent if not the most violent wars europe has ever seen . 
  we owe them nothing but i think its the right thing to do . 
  unfortunately most are unable to assimilate and are not able to live in a modern society . 
  i want us to help them but without resettling them into europe . 
  thats why i have been supporting the australian solution since the start of the crisis . 
  i tried for a long time to come up with a counter argument but just convinced myself more that you are right . 
  ok , the us doesnt spend a ridiculous amount on the military . 
  i still do not agree that the answer to the middle eastern problems in military intervention , though , and therefore do not think that a significant rise in military spending in the eu would be beneficial . 
  ~ ~ why did the ussr fail ? 
  in part because they were spending all their money on military . 
  the us is currently spending 1/5 of their budget on the military . 
  you cant provide healthcare to your citizens for a measly part of that but you can spend the gdp and a half of germany ( nope ) on weaponry . 
  you cant have a functioning public anything but you can waste billions on the random wishes of the pentagon . 
  i do not want to live in a military state where we are constantly ready to go to war and employ a majority of resources preparing . 
  yes , some countries spend way too little on military , it should be at least the 2 % nato requires . 
  but fuck spending 1/5 of our budget ( 1/10 of which is deficit ) on military . ~ ~ sometimes i talk out of my ass . 
  the us is not spending a ridiculous amount on military if its only about 3.5 % of their gdp . 
  the middle east will never be `` fixed '' by the outside . 
  they need to organize themselves and establish working states that are supported by the people . 
  military intervention will just be another waste of money only to have the same thing happen in 10 years . 
  sending supplies and weapons is good enough . 
  you cant grab them by the collars and shove them in the war without them wanting to . 
  if they do no save themselves no one else can do it for them . 
  the best and only thing we should do is support them with resources . 
  ** edit ** : not 1/3 of budget but 1/5 and its no where near the germany 's gdp ( i mixed up the figure in my head and used the usa gdp ( 18tr ) instead of their budget ( 4tr ) . 
  the us military spending is just under 700bln . 
  i am skeptical they will get anything after the war . 
  the kurds at least secured a deal with assad before isis became a thing and turned against the rebels so its more possible that they get some autonomy . 
  but whatever happens no one will win , rebuilding the region and the economy will take decades . 
  talk about a lost generation . 
  easy to say that . 
  much harder to do . 
  plus they cant win , whatever happens they will either be ruled by an authoritarian dictator or various islamist groups , or isis .
