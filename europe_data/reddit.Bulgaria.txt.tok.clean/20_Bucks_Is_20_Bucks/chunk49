  victory means decades of rebuilding and living in a state that will never develop into an even mediocre country in your lifetime . 
  and this is not some civilized european war . 
  this is isis , people who torture and execute prisoners without a care in the world . 
  europe is their only chance for a normal life . 
  so dont blame them for trying to come here , its just a damn shame they are not adequate for europe . 
  we need to make sure that we manage the new ( robotic ) industrialization so that it doesnt just make us work harder , faster , more to barely manage to survive . 
  humans have never been more stressed and overworked than today , we need to use the advancements in robotics to benefit us , not just to produce more . 
  division doesnt serve human kind well . 
  britain doesnt risk a year long recession if it votes against brexit . 
  is that better ? 
  or is it that people are disregarding every opinion thats against brexit . 
  maybe he is not . 
  i do not know enough about either candidate except for what i have read in this thread . 
  i believe currently , in today 's society the fars are for irrational and unreasonable people . 
  i would love for you to show me an example of a party that doesnt have irrational polities as a majority of their policies though . 
  i am always open to change and a good argument can surely make me do so . 
  i mean i get where the people were coming from but you cant deny those protests were fueled by intolerance and hate towards another religion . 
  nobody in poland protested against the far more ukrainian refugees that went there . 
  well if they are being inconsiderable then i get you . 
  dont blame shisha though :d, 
  so op is not intolerant towards the migrants ? 
  i know how much muslims are despised in eastern europe and i am sure russia is not different . 
  thats why i am always skeptical when it comes to the migrant crisis and eastern europe . 
  like the massive protests in poland over 4000 refugees that would be relocated there and their care payed for by the eu . 
  was that response accurate or a little over the top ? 
  yes i am against the migrants being relocated into our societies because i do not believe the majority can assimilate . 
  but is it the end of the world if 4000 get relocated to poland ? 
  heck no . 
  the political spectrum is the same everywhere . 
  just because a party is the leftest in a country doesnt mean they are far-left . 
  the term literally refers to how far from the center the party/person is on the political spectrum . 
  what is the general public opinion towards those muslim minorities ? 
  its not positive . 
  i think your problem is that guy not shisha bars . 
  shisha bars are cool . 
  yeah but greece is different since it is surrounded by non-schengen countries and the refugees were land-bound . 
  they still had to cross protected borders to go to any country that borders greece . 
  im fine here thanks . 
  you should pack for russia or north korea , there they wont have anything nice to say about immigrants . 
  oh but wait then you will be one . 
  being bigoted sure sucks . 
  ** edit ** - well if saying that because the far right party didnt win in austria the european civilization would be destroyed is not bigoted then i do not know what bigoted is . 
  the far sides of the political spectrum is for irrational people . 
  the far sides have never been right in any point in history . 
  cool . 
  no they were sitting on the hungarian border . 
  some had made it into italy and spain but that was nothing compared to the number of refugees on the balkan route at the time . 
  ah , i see you judge news the same way putin does . 
  if you like it it stays if you dont-in the trash it goes . 
  well i am a liberal leftist , and i believe that the australian solution to the refugee crisis is the best one . 
  the green party in austria apparently also has a very rational solution . 
  i think its mostly countries like sweden and germany where the leftists are being unreasonable . 
  but voting for a party with which you disagree on almost every issue but their immigration policy is wrong . 
  in a federal union or confederation many of the decisions are made locally . 
  like in the us , federal laws are not made often . 
  and if they are its because a common policy is better than 28 different ones . 
  like regulations on food and trade . 
  many more decisions , and the ones that actually affect the average joe are made locally , like gun laws and taxes and minimum wage , etc. 
  as i said people only vote for them during times of crisis because of fear or ignorance . 
  right now the far-right is on the rise because of their immigration policy , people will not support their other ideologies . 
  i do not see it fair that countries like bulgaria should have the same amount of power as the uk or spain or germany . 
  a vote should be worth the same . 
  but its unfair when 1 bulgarian vote = 11 germans votes . 
  well the media has played a very large part in frightening the people . 
  not that there havent been scary occurrences . 
  i admire the west and their belief in the fundamental goodness of humans . 
  but you cant take people who still follow ideologies from a thousand years ago and put them amongst a modern society . 
  i also understand why countries like germany refuse to put them in refugee camps and guard them from leaving . 
  the biggest mistake was when merkel and austria opened their borders and let all the refugees into schengen as it compromised the agreement 's integrity making people believe it is ineffective and having them want stricter border controls leading to the rise of the far-right in europe . 
  so we will just continue trading eye for an eye because of ancestral quarrels ? 
  europe can not survive that , it used to be okay for us to be at each other 's throats but now everybody else has caught up and some players are much larger and have much greater potential than any european nation . 
  and membership within the eu is not mandatory and any member can leave at any time so its more like bending your fingers for a handshake rather than your knees . 
  but for it to happen over and over again throughout europe ? 
  if they or their ideas were competent people would vote for them and not only in times of crisis because of fear and ignorance . 
  conquerors . 
  haha . 
  some people will find something wrong with anything if they want it enough . 
  you are one of those people when it comes to the eu . 
   the power of deciding and threatening those who disagree . 
  the power of bending the rules . 
  when has this happened ? 
   the power of negotiating deals in the name of the rest . 
  as i said this happens because nobody else wants to do any work for the eu . 
  why did merkel go to talk to putin when crimea happened ? 
  because nobody else wanted to . 
  she didnt want to either but someone had to . 
  but any decisions like the ttip are not made by institutions from outside the eu . 
  the german or french government have no say when it comes to eu decisions . 
  their representatives within the eu have . 
   the power of size , money and influence . 
  nature of politics and nature of nature . 
  how would it be fair if germany had the same influence as bulgaria ? 
  richer , stronger and more influential countries and organisations will always have more power than the weaker ones . 
  blame human behavior for that . 
  well then , cant comprehend why people would be acting as if he would be the end of the austrian culture if he won . 
  what powers do they have that the other members lack that make them the rulers of the eu . 
  why ? 
  i know nothing about either candidates . 
  but if the choice is between far-right immigration policy and far-left immigration policy i would just not vote , barricade my house and stay there until the next election . 
  where is the guy who says we should let in * some * migrants ** if ** they pass the regular immigration policies , and then help the rest of the refugees but without letting them into europe .
