  united and working together doesnt mean doing whatever one member wants for the sake of the others . 
  it means doing the best for the whole union . 
  the greeks are solely responsible for what happened to them ( apart from the world crisis ) and blaming the eu for not coughing up large amounts of cash and giving them to a country that has proven their financial irresponsibility is unreasonable . 
  the eu currently is still just a union where members voluntarily give parts of their powers to it . 
  the countries are still massively in charge of everything they do . 
  the eu didnt have the power to stop greece for irresponsibly getting into debt and i can only imagine what the people would have said if the eu tried to meddle in what was happening . 
  as the eu we are currently united insignificantly because there lacks a central government . 
  so you are basically blaming the eu for the powers in does not have . 
  the eu is working towards unity but we havent achieved it yet . 
  the eu cant `` deal '' with any of its members , worse thing it can do for greece is do nothing and it has already done more than that but the fact that people like you are viewing the bail-outs or even doing nothing as eu being unfair to greece is to me preposterous . 
  are poles not resistant due to the plague not affecting them ? 
  what bending of the rules , are you talking about when the greeks lied and covered the real state of their economy in order to join the eurozone , oh that wasnt bending that was basically fraud ? 
  and greece 's democratically elected government has always been free to do whatever they wish to , but when you threaten the economy of others because of your own doings you will be expected to deal with the problem . 
  i am not sure about that , i think that completely destroying your economy and damaging the common currency due to the awful decisions that the country made is not really working towards a better future but stupidity and selfishness for the sake of the others . 
  you care about humans so you want them to divide themselves further and continue trying to out-manoeuvre each other and to hinder each other instead of uniting and working together for a better future ? 
  sounds to me like you actually care about preserving a broken status quo rather than improving the lives of humans . 
  it was in dupnitsa though its very hard to find any info on it ( i have a feeling the communist regime moved quickly to cover as much of it up as possible ) . 
  it was not used for exterminations but as a ground from which the jews were sent to other camps . 
  we werent genocidal but we did go out of our way to capture serbian and greek jews for nazi germany . 
  we even had a concentration camp . 
  we have to deal with the same things here in bulgaria . 
  just recently we had a school teacher who is also a public figure and a politician talk about this at a tedx talk . 
  people went crazy calling him anti-bulgarian and it didnt help that he is not of bulgarian origin and his name is emil jassim . 
  dont forget austria . 
  that plus the number of parties running so closely is a good indicator of a highly functioning democracy and country . 
  ah good thats actually a very good turn out . 
  with a 33 % turnout i think we can throw all polls in the garbage and expect anything . 
  dunno , unfortunately i remember that video of that baby penguin that got slowly disembowelled and eaten to death by a seagull for like 20 minutes . 
  nature is scary . 
  well now we just have to scale it . 
  i feel like the netherlands have been a trend setter for europe historically so i really hope they dont get a populist in charge . 
  apparently as fascist as possible . 
   1 ) because some non democratic systems are worse than democracy and some are better than democracy . 
  what a coincidence then that all the best countries in the world are liberal democracies . 
   2 ) because people should be more concerned about the well being of their countries than their own well being . 
  moving anywhere because you think you would be better of there instead of trying to improve your country is ultimately selfish . 
  i disagree but then that has nothing to do with liberalism unless you are saying countries should imprison their populations . 
  you saw how the late 20th century was for our countries , or maybe you havent and thats why you are looking into repeating yesterday 's mistakes . 
  yeah who needs civil rights and shit . 
  north korea has 0 liberalism why dont you go there ? 
  no i know there are issues in turkey especially since erdogan but people vote against their interests even in fully functioning democracies so the effect is doubled in turkey . 
  with brexit and trump as potus i dont need to question whether the people would vote against their interests . 
  the irony of ending democracy with a vote . 
  this is basically a i < 3ny t-shirt but on the legs of pretty girls . 
  its genius . 
  when i think about the main characteristic of the regime on city planning i think about needless destruction in order to fulfil some symbolic nonsense . 
  the building is beautiful and you are lucky to have gotten away with only that compared to our palace of culture . 
  now that american corporations will truly own your government i am sure that you will do fine . 
  haha to be honest we have literally fought against the serbs in absolutely every war we have fought since liberation except the first balkan war so its easy to get mixed up . 
  oh thats actually the serbo-bulgarian war of 1885 where the serbs attacked bulgaria to challenge the unification with rumelia . 
  yeah the way the second balkan war was taught to me was that it was totally serbia and greece 's fault that bulgaria attacked them . 
  the second balkan war was started because the bulgarians were very disappointed and even insulted over the treaty of london-1913 especially because bulgaria and serbia had a treaty signed of how to split the macedonian region before the war broke out which the serbs ignored after the war and instead just annexed all the territories which they had occupied . 
  bulgaria and ferdinand were furious and a month after the first balkan war ended bulgaria attacked both serbia and greece who in the meantime had sighed a defensive pact against bulgaria . 
  bulgaria even knew of this treaty before engaging which makes the decision to attack even more puzzling . 
  serbia and greece repulsed the attack and were joined by romania and turkey ** and ** montenegro . 
  the war lasted 39 days which became bulgaria 's second contribution to the top 10 shortest wars in history the first one being the serbo-bulgarian war of 1885 which was even shorter . 
  so why do i think this was the biggest mistake of modern bulgaria ? 
  bulgaria entered a massive national crisis which affected its economic industrial and military capabilities for ww1 . 
  bulgaria alienated itself from ** all ** of its allies , back then bulgaria only had the balkan league as allies as relations with russia had worsened ever since the serbo-bulgarian war and ever before that . 
  bulgaria 's ambitions for macedonia became an obsession akin to a drug addict and his drug . 
  this was ** the ** reason bulgaria joined the central powers during ww1 and even ww2 . 
  what did the central powers promise bulgaria ? 
  macedonia + greek territories . 
  also bulgaria and ferdinand were really looking into some revenge for the embarrassment they had suffered so joining the entente would have meant peace with serbia and neutral ( and buzzing with entente troops ) greece plus all the bulgaria claimed foreign territories were part of greece and macedonia ( plus the newly ceded southern dobrudja to romania which was also neutral ) meaning there was nothing for bulgaria to gain from going to war with turkey who were the only central powers in the region ( with germans and austro-hungarians still having issues in serbia ) . 
  starting the second balkan war labelled bulgaria as traitors and as untrustworthy , i dont remember the source for this but i remember reading the statement of someone from the great powers who was very adamant in punishing bulgaria as much as possible at the end of ww1 because of that . 
  and they did bulgaria was very severely punished losing the territory it had at the aegean sea plus some minor parts of its western border to serbia . 
  there were also reparations and this completely crippled bulgaria which suffered another massive national disaster . 
  so after the aftermath of the second balkan war and ww1 bulgaria was ally-less , penniless , stripped out of more territory than it gained from the first balkan war and internally very unstable . 
  the position that bulgaria was in during the inter-war period can be blamed for why bulgaria joined the axis in ww2 . 
  now the events surrounding bulgaria joining the axis are way more complicated than just saying it was due to ww1 and the second balkan war but imo it was the position bulgaria was in after those wars that resulted in the bulgaria that would join the axis . 
  bulgaria had a chance to escape communism if it had n't started the second balkan war and fought twice versus the western powers minus germany . 
  if bulgaria had instead sided with greece and the uk during the 20th century i think there was a high chance that churchill would have fought against bulgaria falling under the influence of the soviet union . 
  this is the most cloudy and baseless hypothesis i make but just imagine this - bulgaria does not start the 2nd balkan war which means it does n't lose dobrudja , it does n't join either side in ww1 in turn keeping its territory in the aegean sea becoming much more strategically important and without having any of its bad anti-western powers reputation there is a chance for bulgaria to have remained independent and capitalist especially since the soviets would n't have had the excuse of bulgaria being axis to do whatever they please as they passed through creating a coup and a communist government though that certainly did n't help poland . 
  i hope this was n't too confusing i am very bad at writing cleanly but i did my best considering how much i wrote . 
  it was mainly completely untrained conscripts and many died from poor logistics and disease . 
  but yeah bulgaria was the driving force of the first balkan war and fought the most and lost the most men . 
  speaking as neutrally as possible bulgaria was pretty much snubbed though , bulgaria got less territory than both serbia or greece ( serbia effectively doubled its territory ) while they got areas with bulgarian ethnic majority especially in modern day macedonia which was completely given to serbia . 
  so one can even come up with another similarity to the germans , both countries were heavily disappointed in a treaty which resulted in more instability and another war ( ww2 and 2nd balkan war ) . 
  though i believe that starting the second balkan war was the dumbest move bulgaria has ever done in its modern history effectively deciding its future for the rest of the 20th century . 
  large army and wannabe conqueror king ferdinand i. 
  during the first balkan war bulgaria fielded 500k soldiers which was about 12 % of its population at the time . 
  havent seen one protest about 1.3 million ukrainians , how many were there for the 4000 muslim ones that the eu never sent ? 
  uhm yes it is and the least its not an issue that can be discarded as ridiculous as you have . 
  at 2:18 that whole section which i assume is a party quickly decided their stance . 
  majority of the voting ones and those ones are the ones that matter . 
  the biggest one imo is the division between western and eastern values . 
  especially the older people , many of them armed with nostalgia think that everything was so much better during the socialist regime years . 
  we have so many people that like trump and putin because they are `` strong '' leaders and thus we have a very strong radical nationalist faction that would have us fight against the world because bulgaria is so much better than everybody while the truth is we are a small poor nation-state in between two continents and value systems . 
  so geo-politically we are all over the place which to me just sounds like massive problems in the future when the world isnt as stable as it is now . 
  internally we have so much corruption that has infected absolutely every institution . 
  who isnt corrupt ? 
  one can never tell , everybody promises to fight corruption and then we have a basically non-existent anti-corruption bureau . 
  socially we are as divided as ever . 
  homophobia and racism run rampant where casually hating lgbt and jews/turks/blacks , etc. 
  is perfectly acceptable . 
  our school system is a joke , literature and history classes are basically patriotism classes , a remnant of the old hyper nationalistic socialist regime and its system so even our young people are coming into the world as institutionalised turk haters who cant think rationally . 
  i have 2 siblings , i remember when each one of us came home one time after kindergarten and declared how we hate the turks because they hanged one of our freedom fighters during the 19th century i am sure almost every child has to go through this , thankfully my parents taught me better but what about those that didnt ? 
  currently its taboo to even question the historical status quo . 
  our ex-ex education minister was forced to resign because he stated a historical fact and the people went crazy because it was lessening the martyr role of bulgarians during the ottoman rule which is how most people in bulgaria like to think it was . 
  we are poor we are divided we are small and weak .
