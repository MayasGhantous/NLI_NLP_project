  i am still not sure if they were joking . 
  the radical nationalists came in 3rd . 
  its not that bad but my optimism for the future of my country really took a beating . 
  difference is the oil and gas sector is like 40 % of their gdp , the % would be higher in some me countries but 40 % is extremely high for europe . 
  the oil and gas sector is a bad one to have as dominant in your country especially when there is so much corruption since its benefits have a small spread a.k.a most of the benefactors are a small amount of people at the top hence one of the reason why russia has such a bad oligarch problem . 
  he still isnt president but these statements are exactly what i was scared about apart from his last 2 points where i personally find some hope . 
  the scariest thing for me is that he says that we should leave crimea to russia because they already have it and stop the sanctions . 
  basically showing spinelessness towards russia whilst stating that he wants bulgaria to have a voice when talking about the eu . 
  i am yet to find a person/friend who disagrees with him which to me is very troubling . 
  most of my friends are actually surprised when i say that i really dislike him and look at me as if i am saying something impossible . 
  what the next 5 years will look like imo is him acting all tough towards the west whilst giving russia as much as he can , and the people will rejoice thinking he is being fair . 
  ** auto translated , i will try to fix the translation ** its a positive thing that donald trump is `` not a slave to political bias , '' said president-elect rumen radev in an interview with french channel france 24 . 
  he said trump is open to dialogue and is always looking for the most pragmatic approach to problems . 
  my hope for his term is that it will lead to `` restoring dialogue with russia , which is very important for peaceful coexistence in the world and europe in particular , '' said radev . 
  ** on the sanctions against moscow ** `` of course i want to see these sanctions lifted , '' said radev and stated that though they inflict damage to russia , european countries are also suffering . 
  the decision must be taken unanimously and jointly . 
  bulgaria will follow european policy , but bulgaria has its own voice . 
  i think in the near future sanctions will be lifted , says the president . 
  ** on the russian occupation of crimea ** , he called for `` more realism and pragmatism . '', 
  `` for europe crimea is ukrainian , it is on the map of ukraine . 
  in fact , however , it is russian , we can not ignore the reality that the russian flag flies over crimea . 
  the future of crimea will be decided by the people who should be asked whether they wish to return to ukraine , this question is irrelevant . 
  but here you have to really find civilized solutions , `` said radev . 
  ** on the relationship between economics and politics ** we should not let the economy be dominated by politics , he responds to the question of * how to balance russian influence in the bulgarian economy and energy and political orientation towards the eu * . 
  bulgaria has a very clear orientation towards the eu and the most important investors in bulgaria are european companies , said radev . 
  however , we need a multilateral approach to choose what is most beneficial to us as a country . 
  and our economy should not be determined by our political ties . 
  bulgaria shed many efforts to diversify its energy suppliers , he stated . 
  it does not matter where they come from as gas and supplies are stable and the price is low . 
  i think it 's natural for bulgaria to be a hub for energy corridors . 
  ** on the tenth anniversary of bulgaria in the eu ** `` the most important thing is that bulgaria 's membership was approached with great expectations and enthusiasm . 
  part of this enthusiasm has proven justified , '' he said . 
  `` what we do not want and can not accept , it is a two-speed europe '' , he said on the issue of accession to the schengen area . 
  `` bulgaria has long fulfilled all technical requirements . '', 
  ** on the reception of asylum seekers and refugees ** `` our people are compassionate and have always helped those in need and i mean refugee families who fled the horrors of war , '' he said about the relocation scheme adopted by the european council in september 2015 . 
  `` but the focus shifted from a refugee problem to a migrant problem and the difference is great . 
  so i think the dublin regulation is unfair to countries in the eu periphery such as , bulgaria , greece , italy and spain . 
  if you decide that the illegal migrants who have registered in member countries on the periphery of the eu , should be returned there , it will turn these countries into buffer zones . 
  this , i think , is unfair . '', 
  russian gdp is very highly inflated due to the oil and gas trade . 
  if you take out the oil sector i dont think even bulgaria would be lower than russia . 
  monica crowley , what went on in your head ? 
  oh , monica crowley , did you talk to the dead ? 
  your life style to me seemed so tragic with the thrill of it all you fooled all the people with magic yeah , you waited on ~ ~ satan ~ ~ donald 's call, 
  well i know that its hard to link the eu to peace but usually countries that cooperate so closely dont go to war with each other . 
  germany is spending a lot of dough in those countries as foreign aid and they have already stated that not accepting refused refugees will result in that aid being cut . 
  no country will close their borders . 
  you need to put an / s man , these days someone could really say and believe that . 
  poland teaming up with russia ? 
  in other news palestine and israel team up against the us . 
  this blaming game is pathetic . 
  some vandals vandalising doesnt equal  ukrainians are really , really trying their best to get rid of any sympathy we have for them, 
  i would be cool with that as long as they accommodate public transport for it . 
  this would be an amazing opportunity for small electric driverless busses . 
  being accurate with information is the funnest imho . 
  for example , the hungarians and huns are not related ^ ^ ^ oh ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ yeah ^ ^ ^ thats ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ spot . 
  see ? 
  fun . 
  i always do ? 
  you have an albanian flag flying in the center of of your capital and the video makes certain to show it ? 
  making sure people like me who were in your favour start questioning that . 
  i believe that culture is constantly evolving and by forcing things like language or commerce as you said into it is not healthy . 
  and if irish is getting less and less popular with all that government support then isnt that a sign that its just not meant to be ? 
  if legislation is proposed to reduce the irish language 's power would that be viewed as unpatriotic by the people ? 
  because if it is i think that shows that there is a problem . 
  i know , its the same in bulgaria . 
  i just think it would be better to let the national identity develop naturally . 
  on the contrary , i do , but i feel like making irish as official as english uncovers some insecurities . 
  i see the same thing in my country , the struggle to find/rediscover the nation 's identity . 
  but i think its a mistake trying to find it so desperately in the past that sometimes you use obsolete things like making a language that over 95 % of the people dont speak as official as the one that every one does . 
  `` wow , since ireland has their own language they * must * be a legit nation state and must be incredibly separate from the english with whom they share only a tiny bit of their history '' - what the irish government hopes we are all thinking . 
  and i am just going with : why tho ? 
  you are making the leavers ' mistake confusing separation with freedom . 
  you havent left shit yet though have you . 
  the eu is still having the same positive effect on your economy it did before the vote . 
  only one thing has happened due to the vote in the uk and that is the unrecovered pound drop . 
  man , how delusional can you be . 
  cool , i assume that after your country embarrassed itself with the whole expert thing you wouldnt say that jokingly and would have realised that experts know more about the issue than either me or you or any non-expert . 
  so lets do it . 
  for people like him comprehension only occurs when it drives his agenda . 
  34 of the millions that receive benefits from the danish government allegedly have jihadist aspirations . 
  eu literary created isis and is bankrolling their soldiers . 
  thanks to asking questions we uncovered the truth that the diabolical terrorist organisation-the u.s.s.e. 
  has been trying to hide ever since they financed 9-11 . 
  he is only asking questions . 
  what is the eu against asking questions ? 
  if they are against questions they must be tyrants and corrupt . 
  but he will never stop asking the questions that matter . 
  did the eu create isis ? 
  how much is the eu paying each isis soldier ? 
  is the eu responsible for all the hunger in africa ? 
  why arent they doing anything to feed the african children ? 
  why is the eu sending aide to muslim countries , is it to supply isis ? 
  these are the questions that matter . 
  answer in less than 5 minutes with proof that he will never accept or he would have proven that eu = literary ussr . 
  with more than 25 % of latvia 's population calling themselves ethnically russian , latvia has the biggest russian minority in the whole of europe beating out estonia , ukraine and even belarus . 
  but sure , we are the mini-russia . 
  its ok though we are probably the most pro-russian country in the eu having just elected a very pro-russian general as president so i will just go cry in the shower . 
  eu and nato are made up of dozens of countries with their own views . 
  if on some issues a majority of them think differently than your own country you got ta ride it out because its impossible to have everybody agree with everything all the time , like a democracy .
