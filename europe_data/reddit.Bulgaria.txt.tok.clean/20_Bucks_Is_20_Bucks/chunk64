  you could also say this is because of the nature of the candidates , republicans being traditional and having issues with women and minorities and hillary being a woman but i think this is an issue you see everywhere . 
  i dont think its about smarts , it was hard for me to believe it but there were many smart people who voted for trump , in fact if only the white vote was counted trump wouldve have won by more than 80 % . 
  its about people relying on emotion rather than reason when voting . 
  ** edit - ** i shouldnt have stated percentages based on just memory without checking , the more than 80 % might have been based on white males only , sorry about that . 
  when people get used to the solutions they forget they are there only seeing the few issues that stick out . 
  well yeah but nobody is saying that they should be allowed to join before they complete the chapters which cover these things and the eu says they are ready . 
  they are currently in favour , so their self professed goals are converged with the eu . 
  the question is will it remain so , you are saying there is no question to begin with . 
  a person living in romania saying that aint convincing either haha . 
  but why isnt unity for the sake of unity a convincing argument ? 
  unity brings a lot of things with it , peace , cooperation which brings prosperity , safety , etc. 
  if thw whole world was united would that be a bad or a good thing ? 
  well then you better go out and do your part to keep europe united . 
  eu federalists represent !, 
  nah man fuck those people . 
  i would love to see serbia in the eu and to see our countries cooperate more . 
  as long as serbia completes all chapters and the eu says you are ready i will be cool with it . 
  heres hoping one day i can enjoy belgrade and serbian bbq without getting my ass pummelled by the roaming charges . 
  serbia can decide if it does when the time comes , currently more people are in favour than against . 
  haha nice dodge !, 
  if he were any austrian who would he be ? 
  true . 
  its also interesting that the republic never managed to recover especially since caligula was only the 3rd emperor . 
  though i guess augustus and tiberius had very successful reigns cementing the empire . 
  well you are trying to turn this into a fascist vs anti-fascist debate . 
   this is a result of such events being overblown constantly and considered high risk despite most being peaceful . 
  youre a mayor/chief of police and are told there will be such an event that is known to rile up people . 
  you cant know exactly how many people there will be so you send as many as you think would be necessary . 
  i dont think its an overreaction of what could happen at such an event , but that its an overreaction to how many people actually showed up . 
   both the far right and the far left had terrorist organizations in the past decades and both participated in riots , looting , assaults and swarms of other examples of violence . 
  hence why i said far-side extremists , not far-right . 
   lol , everything i write seems to be some kind of agenda apparently . 
  im talking about this post , if you feel that i have attacked all your comment history then maybe you yourself believe it . 
  i wasnt trying to be a dick to you or anything , its just weird why you would try to push this so hard out of the left field when it is so hard to make it relate to the topic . 
   in reality , i was merely making fun of how overblown such demonstrations are and especially clashes between such right wingers and antifas in the media . 
  they nearly always ad some 0 's to the numbers involved and hype it up as much as possible . 
  well i think its obvious , far-side extremists are much more prone to violence and the nature of their ideologies ( the fact that they are far ) drives them towards conflict the easiest . 
  i was really obsessed with caesar for a long time , recently it dawned on me that he was basically a roman trump . 
  he always campaigned with promises that he will save the republic ( make the republic great again haha ) and then the moment he returns from hunting pompey and shagging cleopatra he tries to destroy it . 
  he even had mark antony try to put a crown on his head at his triumph but the crowd was having non of it , mark antony put it on his head 3 times and the crowd booed him 3 times and he gave up . 
  if i lived in rome at the time i wouldve been absolutely against the populist tyrant , cant believe that the real heroes of rome were the senators that killed him ( inadvertently destroying the republic with him but hey they tried ) . 
  im not saying that trump will destroy the us but they basically got elected by running the same campaign and then neither `` drained the swamp '' . 
  they are just moving it from wimbledon to another place though , arent they ? 
  why are you trying to bring some bs agenda into the mix from nowhere that has barely anything to do with the topic ? 
  you are beyond reasoning . 
   international law or we can call it international system in this form was created after ww2 . 
  those who can break it they do it all the time/russia , us , france , uk , prc , saudis , israel and so on you know whats the difference ? 
  i can go to any square in the eu and protest any wrongdoings . 
  i can protest and protests bring governments down throughout europe . 
  go to russia and protest against the dictator , you will find yourself in jail or with a bullet in your head like many others have . 
  worst off yet , nobody wants to protest putin , hes got 90 % approval rates , he has the media and has the whole nation believing that what he does is the best for russia while he sanctions those same people and they struggle to buy food while at the same time believing its the eu 's fault . 
  where were all the russian patriots to battle against the food sanctions putin put out ? 
  where were they when he burned tonnes of food because they came from the eu ? 
  dont come here preaching that bullshit argument of `` we all do it so what '' because we dont all do it . 
  and even if we did we ** know ** that is not justification for doing more bad shit . 
  you are so brain-washed by the regime 's propaganda and its so clear because most russians people try to debate us as if we were brain-washed as well , and thats why you all never try to justify what putin is doing , at least the sane ones dont because they know there is not justification or truth to what your country is doing , all you bots do is say * `` kosovo , iraq , you did it to , but but america , its not your business '' , etc. 
   yes west created mess and let them alone ( nothing else could have been done in both cases after russian reaction . 
  you left them alone ? 
  havent seen russian troops and equipment moving away from eastern ukraine or crimea . 
  i havent seen them do the same in georgia where they randomly annex a couple of kilometres here and there . 
   why certain western states thought it is wise to , , support , , anti russian politicians and do crazy irrational decisions and that russia won t react is unvelievable . 
  what crazy irrational decisions ? 
  what support for anti-russian politicians ? 
  i swear every time somebody criticises russia the russians are like poor little us with the 2nd biggest military in the world which we use to bully other nations with are being ganged up on by the evil irrational west . 
  poor ol' us , dont they know that if they didnt disagree with us we wouldnt have to show them we are big strong manly men ? 
  100 % sure that if it wasnt for the eu and nato russia would use their influence to either turn bulgaria to their side belarus style or respond in force like it has done in ukraine and georgia . 
  russia is already financing the neo-nazis and radical nationalists . 
   italy has 0 reasons to be worried about russia , they have totally different problems . 
  so stop argumenting with bs like that until italy is invaded by russia ... yes it is not their problem . 
  how about upstanding international law and a country sovereignty ? 
  we cant just let the russians bully whomever they want and turn a blind eye because its not happening to us . 
  this is what happens when the governments controls the whole media . 
  nobody stuck up for ukraine , what happened to it ? 
  nobody stuck up for georgia , what happened to it . 
  of course you want to create division between the eu and europe so you can bully weaker countries because that is what your country does . 
  if that was n't the case russia would n't be financing the strongest euro-sceptic parties in each country . 
  if that was n't the case russia would n't come up with bullshit excuses for cases like the crimea annexation or the airplane their men shot down with their equipment . 
  italy is a western nation which should value democracy and peace , so automatically she should be against what russia is doing . 
  yeah cause russia never does anything crazy or unexpected . 
  the world will stay as it is forever and no shifts of power will occur ever again . 
  ah so until they invade italy its not your problem ? 
  with that mind-set russia might actually manage to gather enough power and influence do to it . 
   we 're not very enthusiastic in antagonizing a big trade partner . 
  or the number one reason china , saudi arabia and other authoritarian hostile nations have gotten so much powerful in the past half a decade . 
  the free market used to be free only for the democratic , peaceful nations . 
  now we cant even hold on to sanctions against warmongering countries who attack their neighbours . 
  `` we lost some money so lets * really * show russia they can do absolutely whatever they want . '', 
  its very hard to assess parties but imo our current president plevneliev was the cleanest one we have had . 
  but we just elected a general with 0 political experience who has unclear ties with the whole political establishment in bulgaria and is a great admirer of russia ... and because he won the government resigned and now nobody wants the mandate to create a new one sooo yeah . 
  the one good thing we had has turned to chaos as well . 
  as is said in the article we need to create an independent anti-corruption body but the more independent it is the more likely it jails the person who creates it . 
  the political scene in bulgaria is a total shit show and 2016 wasnt kind to us either . 
  bulgaria is so homophobic ... 
  even the younger people are mostly homophobic . 
   eu policy is decided by feelings and emotion , rather than logic and objectivity . 
  bullshit biased opinion meter going off the rails on this one . 
  i dont think it affects my point either wise . 
  what i am saying is that nation states where homogeny was sought and mostly achieved have driven superficial bodily differences to form between nations of common races . 
  with how ridiculous some factions have become you really need an / s on even the most unbelievable shit because there will always be someone who will say the same thing but seriously . 
  there were several incidents that got to the frontpage of r/europe when they happened in the weeks after the vote but maybe just google it and youll get the articles .
