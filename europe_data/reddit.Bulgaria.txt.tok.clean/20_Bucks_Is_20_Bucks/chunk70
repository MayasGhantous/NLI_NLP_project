  the way accepting some refugees and critiquing the diminishing democracy is infringing on their sovereignty so is receiving billions upon billions of euros . 
  you seem to have been fooled by russia 's propaganda trying to absolve themselves from any blame by creating this bs relation between the two cases . 
  kosovo was n't supported by the west as a way to fulfil their imperialistic aspirations in the region but because of the genocide and atrocities that happened but a decade before giving kosovo 's independence legitimacy . 
  crimea was conquered by russia as a response to the nation-wide protests that removed the corrupt president who was a russian puppet from power which threatened their influence in the region . 
  the only sources i have found on this come from highly biased far-right yellow press papers . 
  nevertheless there ** have ** been migrants going missing , yes . 
  but that happened when they first arrived before they could have their fingerprints taken and their camps assigned . 
  it happened to those who were not taken through the process . 
  all the refugees within the relocation plan ( about 120 000 ) have gone through that process . 
  it is about islamophobia since no pole has an issue with the million ukrainians in poland since the war started but poland is creating an international crisis over 1 % of that number . 
  it is about the ruling party pis using populist methods to create this kind of bullshit thinking :  it only shows its more about disobeying westerns overlords had no problem taking the money for a decade and a half from the `` western overlords '' now they want you to do something barely above doing nothing in solidarity with other members in need and you act this way ? 
  is poland in this for the fraternity or to leech off as much as you can and then bail the first time you are asked to do something you do n't like ? 
  of course it is . 
  it is about poland and the v4 's refusal to accept refugees and the west including macron criticising them . 
  plus this is a response to a comment about the refugees . 
  i am not okay with the populist circlejerk taking over every refugee thread . 
  the only thing that is tiring is people 's ignorance in talking about things they have only heard about from sensationalist sources . 
  it is like the brexit bus but everybody believes in it . 
  the influx of people has been closed for a long time now with the closing of the balkan route . 
  the problem with the mediterranean route is that to stop rescuing the migrants means they will die and the eu will never be ok with that . 
  the relocation plan is to deal with the refugees that were amongst the first to arrive , that is why they are more predominantly syrian and more genuinely refugees . 
  you belong in the first half of the 20th century . 
  lol . 
  all of the ones that are going to be relocated are legally considered refugees . 
  i do n't know where you got me not believe they will be returned from . 
  safe in the case of syria where close to the majority of these refugees are from would be end of civil war and isis . 
  past similar cases include the bosnians who fled to germany during the war with the majority of them returning after , the ones that stayed having learned the language and been allowed to by the government . 
  the only one who would stop the refugees from being deported then would be the host country wanting them to stay . 
  this is not about believing this is literally what the process is with refugees . 
  i would say that italy and greece not collapsing under the strain of these migrants just because they happen to be located where the storm is is beneficial for the whole eu . 
  then again someone sometimes will pick the short stick it happens on every level of governance from your city building an airport close to your home to your region building a garbage recycling centre next to your city , etc. 
  i do n't agree with that nationalist segregation crap but even if you cherish that then you need not worry as these refugees will have their limitations within your society and they ** will ** be returned to their countries when they are deemed safe . 
  they are not immigrants they will not become citizens and they wont gain residency unless your country gives it to them . 
  all of them have had their fingerprints taken and there are other precautions that keep them from going wherever they please since those that are in italy have stayed in italy . 
  and the ones in greece , romania and bulgaria ca n't leave the country legally as we are not in schengen . 
  helping by just being there is not actually doing something . 
  for the first time our countries are asked to do something more significant and look what is happening . 
  not to mention that the quotas for eastern europe are laughable and are mostly there to say we did something too . 
  only an idiot would n't know that these people are legally seen as refugees no matter if you believe it or not , which would allow them to be deported after the wars in their countries are over . 
  plus close to the majority of the refugees covered by the relocation plan are syrian and the quotas on eastern european countries are so minuscule this whole thing should n't have even made the news . 
  `` anything you say that might be seen as even a little bit critical we will use to push our bs agenda that brussels is infringing on our sovereignty . '', 
  `` thanks for all the money and talks about partnership and fraternity for years but let us just say no to helping the first time we are asked to do something we do n't want to and make a big deal out of nothing . '', 
  have n't heard much about the other things but you are absolutely right about the refugees . 
  poland was happy receiving the most funding for years the first time they get asked to help other members by doing something they do n't want to and suddenly they are fighting with their v4 brothers against the muslim invaders that brussels wants to send them . 
  we all have been saying that the uk just wants all the benefits and non of the responsibilities but actually it is eastern europe that should hold that motto . 
  president has nothing to do with the army until war is declared nor does he have any power over the budget . 
  plus fighter jets are fucking expensive and bulgaria cant afford much considering all the other lacking areas like wages for police , teachers , doctors , etc. 
  haha hopefully not . 
  yeah it is a very weird situation we will have to wait and see what solution the eu will come up with . 
  though i think that the members who do not recognise kosovo will be pressured to do so i do not think it will be necessary . 
  serbia being admitted into the eu by recognising kosovo would double as an eu recognition as well . 
  yes it is very hypocritical and is considered a big mistake even by the eu which makes it even more unlikely for them to be open to the idea a second time . 
  with cyprus they tried to go around the rule by admitting the whole island even though the turkish part does now recognise their authority . 
  exactly . 
  i have serbian friends and though they are pro-eu it is only because of the money . 
  as i said i would love for serbia to join but if your values and aspirations do n't align with those of the eu then this relationship would be bad for both sides . 
  she put on a blue hat with yellow dots on it making it similar to the eu flag in her address to the country with many people assuming it shows her support for the eu . 
  to conspiracy nuts the only evidence good enough is the one that pushes the agenda they believe in . 
  you are very delusional . 
  your government has to jump through hoops trying to open and close chapters and the eu is forcing you ? 
  you know who was actually forcing countries into a union ? 
  take a look at your flag . 
  i think the eu made a mistake with cyprus using a kind of a loophole in that they `` accepted '' the whole of cyprus including the turkish part with the idea of reunification that has since failed . 
  the eu has no real control or jurisdiction over turkish cyprus though . 
  well the rule is that no country can join the eu if they have existing land disputes . 
  maybe the eu will pressure countries like spain not to veto but they ca n't make them recognise kosovo because it is not with them that kosovo has a land dispute with . 
  then again , serbia joining while resolving the problem of kosovo would be a de facto recognition of kosovo by the eu which by itself is a problem for spain because it gives separatists a precedent . 
  a country ca n't join the eu if it has current land disputes . 
  i would love it if serbia bro joins but really i do n't want it to be just about the money and the first time they have to do something they do n't want to they have a tantrum over it . 
  if the country does n't believe in the idea of a united europe then they should n't join . 
  i agree they/we should . 
  everybody . 
  such events change countries and influence the whole world . 
  give poland a break on this , it is still a developing economy . 
  there is also a correlation between the score and gdp per capita , it is obvious the poorer countries will do worse as they spend less on science , education , etc. 
  it is a statement to the country 's political scene and to the world . 
  one thing is to have majority , another is to have the largest since de gaulle and with a party which is 1 year old with a leader who was unknown but 2 years ago . 
  but i do expect the countries to hold higher standards because it is the right thing to do . 
  otherwise we go into an endless cycle of justifying mistakes with others ' and nothing ever becoming better . 
  does russia deserve to have its sanctions lifted because the us invaded iraq and because of the west 's interventions in kosovo ? 
  i do n't think so . 
  so i say it again other country 's mistakes are not excuses for your own 's . 
  i blame greece for this the same way i blame italy , slovenia and spain for what they allegedly did as i am not familiar with the situation . 
  why would n't i ? 
  that is not an excuse . 
  bulgaria captured one of the paris attackers does that not count ? 
  no and i am not sure where you got that from . 
  the whole situation arose from muslims being given more rights like being able to abide by sharia law . 
  because it would be illegal to do so . 
  to me it sounds like the problem had been ignored in the past which led to it not being dealt with until now . 
  but the law is the law and even though the issue arises from there being 2 legal systems that does n't mean that you could just legally ignore one or the other . 
  in this case the deceased 's wishes do n't matter because its as if he willed for something which is potentially illegal . 
  you do n't get to choose the laws that apply to you . 
  he gets both law systems and there is no consensus which one can overrule the other . 
   but surely greek law comes above , and surely it says people have a choice . 
  apparently for greek muslims , greek , and sharia law come in equally . 
  i agree that it should n't but you know `` legal '' does n't mean `` rational '' . 
   does it say they have to go by islamic law over greek law ? 
  they do n't but they could that is the problem here . 
  the relationship between the two legal systems is convoluted and that is why this has gone all the way to the echr .
