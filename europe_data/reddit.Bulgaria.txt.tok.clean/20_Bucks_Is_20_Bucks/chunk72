  i am not saying that there isnt an issue with islam as a whole , if so many acts are happening there definitely is but putting everybody together is a mistake , as were those german jokes generalising poles as they offended everybody especially those who were not criminals . 
  i see you are unfamiliar with / r/the _ donald . 
  it is not just about trump , it is a political subreddit which discusses many topics . 
  they are far-right ( though they say alt-right ) so when i said what i said it was calling out this thread for being far-right as well . 
   the majority of refugees in bulgaria are in closed camps away from the major cities and there have been problems with them . 
  thats not true . 
  they have a camp in northern sofia a there are others nearby , i even went there to give them diapers and other supplies when they first came . 
  i even see them walking about at times . 
  its hard to say what exactly it is because its not racism or xenophobia , its irrational hatred based on religious differences . 
  i thought islamophobia was the closest term describing that . 
  you are absolutely correct . 
  the socialist years in bulgaria completely screwed everything up . 
  public opinion was not pro-russian as bulgaria had worsened relations with russia and the end of the 19th century , and had went to war against russia in both world wars . 
  but the regime mind-washed everybody ( a regime put there by the soviets during their occupation of bulgaria at the end of ww2 ) . 
  not deathly afraid of migrants but of muslims . 
  like in poland people are way too polarised by an issue that hasnt touched them . 
  poland has close to 1 million ukrainian refugees have you heard anybody from poland complain about them ? 
  same time relocation plan has 4k migrants that are supposed to go to poland and they are making an international crisis out of it . 
  its islamophobia and most of eastern europe has it . 
  yet bulgaria went to war with russia twice during the last century in both world wars after abandoning the russian sphere of influence in the late 19th century . 
  the love for russia does n't come from the russo-turkish war it comes from the socialist years when russia 's actions were idolised and when monuments for an invading and occupying army were built . 
  its cause of all the muslims , oh wait nothing has happened in bulgaria a country with more refugees than the uk and a 10 % muslim minority . 
  maybe we will have to look more deeply into the problem instead of jumping emotionally on the convenient scapegoat and generalisations . 
  ** edit - ** i just want say that i expected for all my comments in this thread to be heavily downvoted but i am pleasantry surprised they have n't been . 
  it further proves to me that / r/europe is a mature subreddit where we can rationally discuss issues and its what makes it my favourite subreddit . 
  because of the way most people say it . 
  why do we have to have a thread after every such event that belongs more in / r/the _ donald than in / r/europe with generalisation and talks about how europe is turning into this and that when uk especially saw much harder times during the late 20th century at the hands of the ira ? 
  10 years ago people were saying the same about the polish criminals who stole every car and tractor in eastern germany . 
  how does it feel when people make a joke about poles stealing cars when you have never done so ? 
  does n't happen in bulgaria either and we have close to a 10 % muslim minority . 
  i dont agree that `` rapid growth '' which is actually what you said is and should be an important checkpoint for joining the euro . 
  and rapid growth isnt synonymous with stability since any underdeveloped country in the world that does something right is able to achieve such growth , not to mention all the help the eu is giving bulgaria . 
  but do note i did not disagree with you on whether bulgaria was ready to join but rather about rapid growth being the deciding factor . 
  its not about growth but about stability and being responsible enough . 
  diverging from his country 's official opinion ** a hundred years ago ** , nevertheless . 
  not to mention all the genocide . 
  yep i sometimes catch myself remembering the price as 9 instead of 10 when it was 9.99 . 
  it definitely works . 
  you have gone so deep into the pit of sarcasm and trolling that you are close to going 180 degrees and becoming a normal person instead of a pathetic little troll . 
  its not different in bulgaria unfortunately . 
  remember what people were saying about plevneliev or why people voted for radev ? 
  most bulgarians see trump and putin as the `` real leaders '' and people like trudeau and plevneliev as weak ones . 
  bulgaria has only to gain from wavering public support for russia . 
  what 's the point if we are already pegged to it and have been for a couple of decades ? 
  surely there is no financial debate , a referendum would be a populist shitfest of equating currency to national identity . 
  4/4 that is some top notch guessing . 
  yeah and why i said `` in the present '' . 
  i do n't think the technology for efficient storage of such quantities is here yet but tesla is doing miracles in that field so who knows what we will have in 5 years . 
  i do n't think it will be possible to go completely 100 % renewables though , at least not in the present because renewables are unpredictable and do not put out a steady stream of energy . 
  i agree that we should eventually drop other methods of harvesting energy but for the time being we will need to have a reserve that can be turned on when necessary . 
  the best outcome i see is having the capability to cover a large chunk of your energy needs from non-renewables and to use them to cover the fluctuating clean energy . 
  but the advantage is that the waste can be controlled and gathered up and stored away from the environment ( if done properly of course ) . 
  cant do that with coal . 
  i ca n't understand why go after nuclear power though . 
  its clean and cheap and its a good foundation to grow your renewables from . 
  even if you buy into the bs that nuclear power is unsafe what are you , expecting a tsunami in switzerland ? 
  the only reason you guys do n't want to join is because of your fishing industry is n't it ? 
  iceland like norway has the advantage of being in the best location in europe to be forgiven being isolationist so i think that plays a factor as well . 
  nevertheless , i hope you do join . 
  i see the eu as a way for us insignificant countries to survive this century ( though i would be a federalist because of fraternity anyway ) and i am seriously doubting the us 's friendship so maybe nato wont be enough in 50 years who knows . 
   these countries getting rich to me is n't a threat , but an opportunity . 
  i want these countries to get rich . 
  its not a threat until their national interests get mixed up with yours . 
  china is a totalitarian regime with no civil rights and lots of censorship . 
  their values are so much different from the uk 's or italy 's or finland , etc. 
  you cant trust them the way you trust france . 
   ensuring that as much of the world as possible moves towards democracy is to me the challenge of our times then i dont see how you can support closer relationships with countries like china . 
  i am not worried about inter-european ( excluding russia and its neighbours ) issues in the coming century though i am certain that the status quo of friendliness will violently change in the future expedited by events like nato and/or eu breaking up if they were to happen . 
  but the threat i see in this century is from the outside . 
  like russia or china or many of the developing countries with massive populations that just need to get an economy going to completely blast past any individual european country like nigeria , brasil , indonesia , india , etc. 
  some of these sound laughable but lets not forget where china was not 60 not 50 but even 40 years ago . 
  and i think that is a valid thread to peace and independence in europe . 
  they are a country with a 300k population with an economy the size of kosovo . 
  they will have no influence over what happens to europe , they will have no choice but to `` go with the flow '' and like switzerland in ww2 their only saving grace would be that the allies ( eu ) will save them from the bad guys in the world in a war that may not even involve soldiers but influence and political power . 
  i like how you put the uk with iceland because by the end of the century both countries will be insignificant islands somewhere to the east compared to the ones who will actually have a shot at seizing any such opportunity like the eu , china , india . 
  they do , preferably at the local bar . 
  you know it is funny how the people the farthest away from terrorism and migrants are the most paranoid in all the polls and statistics . 
   it 's not islamophobia , we have muslims in poland and have had them for hundreds of years, 
  you are the ones trying to prove to me that you are tolerant by saying `` look weve got muslims already '' which is the equivalent of saying `` im not racist , look i had a black friend in kindergarten '' . 
  the reality is that poland is extremely islamophobic , if it wasnt you wouldnt be creating an international crisis over * nothing * because 4k migrants even when not compared to the million ukrainians is * not news worthy * if it wasnt a matter of religious xenophobia . 
   it 's our country , and we want it to stay polish and be for poles first from the start my argument has been that you have said nothing about the million ukrainians but are fanatically afraid of 4k migrants . 
   even a single polish woman raped or a single person run over by a truck is a cost too high to pay . 
  dude i swear are you taking this from le pen speeches ? 
  again 1 million ukrainians 0.5 of them criminals  than 4k migrants . 
  no shit given about ukraininans no rapist accusations no criminal accusations but when it comes to 4k migrants who are muslim suddenly the world is over and your dear motherland has lost its national identity . 
  * thats * irrational hate towards a different group of people and you are free to do that but you should know what you are when you do . 
  nah i am saying that the xenophobia and in this case islamophobia that is making it that way is . 
  poland is the most homogeneous country in europe with only about 1 % of your population being immigrants if you have like 2000 muslims already that is not proof of tolerance . 
  even if 100 % of those 4k migrants are lazy assholes you need 0.5 % of the ukrainians to be the same to beat that number . 
  your problem is not with immigration or lazy people its islamophobia . 
  edit : poland you deserve your government . 
  seems like its the same way in poland if you are having protests and overwhelming public opposition to 4k migrants but nobody gives a shit about the million from ukraine . 
  i saw this on r/videos and was wondering what / r/europe thinks since it happened in the netherlands . 
  people in the / r/videos thread are overwhelmingly displeased with the sentence and are saying how much better the us legal system is because the driver would have gotten +30 years in prison . 
  this is the court 's position :  ` it is not certain that he was driving too fast . 
  moreover , speed does not have to be the cause of the accident . 
  with his car , the suspect could have taken the bend at 130 kilometers per hour , according to research . 
  furthermore , he was not drunk or stoned or busy with his phone . 
  he also has a blank criminal record . '', 
  well it was * built * as a castrum but castrums are very basic and have wooden walls .
