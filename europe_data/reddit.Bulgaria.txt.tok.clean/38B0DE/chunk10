  somehow i think you all missed the point of this article . 
  maybe reading it beyond the title would be helpful . 
  nice thanks for the information . 
  romanians have been investing a lot in bulgaria 's music business . 
  opening labels , promotions , production companies , festival organizers . 
  if i see some fresh new music i know there 's some romanian investment behind it . 
  i have n't made any statement on obama 's political account . 
  i said the american left was ready to vote for a non-white or non-male candidate for president . 
  i understand obama is n't your guy but that nixon statement is stupid . 
  yeah i realize calling them libs is wrong but social-democrats is tiring to type . 
  political risk is a serious thing . 
  it 's not because of the lobbies but because you have to choose a right time to pump up an issue . 
  the american left has been ready to support a non-white/male pres for 3 decades now but it was n't until the mega failure of bush ' second term that they had a ripe moment that was n't risky . 
  stuff like this can often backfire as a possible miscarry could bury the issue for another 3 decades . 
  but here 's where the difference between a politician and a great politician lays . 
  if they had balls to demand stricter regulations in the banking sector before the big crisis they would 've scored big time by now . 
  now even merkel is pushing it through . 
  angie is anything but stupid . 
  she 's slipping their core issues making them look like both cons and libs are the same , that inevitably leaves the libs outside in the cold . 
  there are principal differences but nobody talks about them because they are seen as too risky . 
  social-democrats are in a `` contents crisis '' also because they have to face hard core lobbying counter attacks on almost anything they could stand on that would extend the differences with the conservatives . 
  they are also insanely far behind on young issues like net neutrality , drm , nontheism , and so on . 
  imho it 's possible . 
  with balls . 
  right now he 's got nothing to lose and could try anything . 
  the same way feldmann won in frankfurt . 
  in a 2 dimensional old school social-democratic populism . 
  he himself could n't believe he won . 
  there is at least 20 % sleeping disbelief vote in germany if not more . 
  people who were alienated in the last 15 years of the spd trying to be mitte and german society developing some masochistic taste for the conservative cock in their ass . 
  he just has to hit the right issues and wake em up . 
  not saying peer is the right guy though . 
  just that it 's still possible . 
  the three big mainstream roma artists in bulgaria are [ azis ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4hq4j4bfom ) ( ** nsfw ** , anything he does is extremely homoerotic and nsfw ) , [ sofi marinova ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awf2aewmswi ) , and [ ivo papzov ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsfhhl9jnn0 ) . 
  do you have mainstream romani stars in romania ? 
  no , muslims are not europe . 
  being single is pretty fantastic believe me . 
  the solitude may seem bad sometimes but that 's just social pressure . 
  i miss flirting , one night stands , and basically freedom to do whatever the fuck i want . 
  every time i have to utter `` no sorry i have a gf '' i die a little inside . 
  but investing in a sturdy relationship with love , warmth , and emotional security pays off in the long run . 
  does that make heaven communism and god a the supreme party leader ? 
  i wrote culture you read ethnicity . 
  thanks for your input though . 
  i 'm looking forward to seeing you raise awareness about the issue of celebrating `` ethnicities '' in finland on december 6th . 
  let 's talk about them without hate and intolerance  celebrate some roma culture !, 
  [ gipsy kings - baila me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex0q48uoc7o ) [ karandila gypsy brass orchestra ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-otioyrmp8 ) [ balkan beat box - gypsy queens ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahdqaoye14 ) [ devotchka - how it ends ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfi1uq_pkqi ) [ gogol bordello - wonderlust king ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwytyfqe-o8 ) [ goran bregovic - champagne for gypsies ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8va-8mwqoi ) [ and of course ] ( http://i.imgur.com/egkk56k.jpg ) ... :d, 
   \u0161arov sounds like a dog with a monocle to me :d, 
  really ? 
  you forgot matse/matsa ?!, 
  before it was used to describe hot women it meant a cat you know . 
  sharo for dogs . 
  if it 's particularly big and hairy looking dog it 's balkan . 
  that was not a funny anecdote . 
  you 're a dumbass but it 's my fault i 'm trying to communicate here . 
  i 'm gon na go tell my german gf and best friend how much i do not like them . 
  r/europe is full of xenophobes . 
  that 's the nicest thing you can say about this breivik clones infested shithole . 
  you make it seem like i 'm pointing finger at normal-centered individuals who do n't `` share '' my opinion but in reality i 'm just describing what it is because i 've been on this platform for long enough to know the client\u00e8le . 
  i could n't give less of a fuck if they share my opinion . 
  we 're debating , not competing for popularity . 
  the problem is you people insisting on never ever having a definition of your world view yet you totally adhere to gross generalizations like `` cypriots should suffer without making a sound because they deserve it '' . 
  the more intolerant , ignorant , and radical your opinions get the more you seem baffled when someone actually points out what incredible xenophobes you are . 
  you do n't get a lot of forums where the mods have to put `` please report racism '' on the top , that 's for sure . 
  i have n't said germans are arrogant for demanding austerity measures or taking the lead out of this crisis . 
  not in any fucking way , shape , or form did i ever said something like that . 
  that also is n't what people have been trying to * express * with their protests . 
  saying germans have been arrogant ignorant assholes through this whole 4 year crisis is n't anti-german . 
  it 's trying to explain to germans why the hell all this protests directed at them are n't solely the fault of those people being the untermenschen that poor people are . 
  do n't play the offended leberwurst , it 's laughable . 
  cool story , coward . 
  sorry buddy , but i 'm not talking about who is responsible . 
  that 's the job of especially intelligent and amazing people like the subscribers of r/europe , who are not cunts and are not driven by xenophobia . 
  i 'm merely presenting an opinion on the polemic , protests , and language that surround the crisis . 
  your offensive rhetoric is only an example . 
  please do not continue . 
  you made [ a separate account ] ( http://www.reddit.com/user/chewbi2 ) just to offend me ? 
  nice !, 
  that takes a very special amount of a pathetic coward . 
  but really the lack of capital letters in that * retribution * is what 's offending . 
  yes , because if i want to connote negative feelings and offend i care about those details . 
  all offensive expressions are extremely politically correct about what an actual ethnicity is . 
  and no , german actually ** is ** an ethnicity . 
  use a dictionary or wikipedia or google or ask a smart person . 
  also the ethnic slur for german is nazi and angry people use it . 
  more about this incredible injustice after the news at eleven . 
  germany pays their ** fair share ** which they 've agreed to . 
  every member of the eu pays and receives their fair share . 
  it 's just as annoying when germans start nagging about how much they pay when no german fucking ever took a single look at some real numbers . 
  it 's just a * feeling * that is based more on what they are being fed by their national media more than practical realities . 
  germans collect criticism and hate because they are very disrespectful , arrogant , and ignorant in times when millions of people in many countries have existential fears . 
  it 's going to get a lot worse before it gets better because the initial reaction of germans is to be more arrogant and ignorant which is only more fuel for hate . 
  i actually believe that 's a good thing because i see a lot of germans now looking at themselves and their magnificent assholishness , and rethinking their approach to others in europe . 
  it might be harsh but it 's teaching germans a lesson in respecting the others while at the same time it gives a chance for others to know who 's their fried in the * happy * eu family . 
  angela merkel is just as hated and [ ridiculed ] ( http://www.dickes-en.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/menopause_merkel-425x566.jpg ) by at least 1/3 of germans themselves . 
  it does n't mean a thing . 
  as a public figure and a responsible politician you have to be prepared to get a lot of that . 
  expecting it to be different is stupid . 
  edit : i love the amount of butthurt downvotes on here every time i point out the arrogance of the bigger european countries over the poorer smaller ones . 
  is there such a thing as westeurocentrism ?
