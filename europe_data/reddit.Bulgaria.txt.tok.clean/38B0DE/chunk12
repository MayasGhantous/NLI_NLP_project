  they officially distance themselves from that but are very much a nazi-exploitation mainstream propaganda . 
  they sing about being victims of some sort of ruling social structure that supposedly wants to oppress patriotism and fatherland pride . 
  purity , honor , christianity , virility , struggle , hate against `` critics '' . 
  when asked about the holocaust the lead singer gave a complete non-answer of the sorts of * `` it was one of the worst stories to happen regretfully also in south tyrol . 
  it is also good that you can tell the youngsters : hey there happened something , learn from history and that it was a work of the devil and it could n't be worse . 
  '' * one of those answers where you ca n't actually catch if he hates the fact that the nazis lost the war or that he really ponders upon the horror of a genocide . 
  it has nothing to do with italians . 
  no , no . 
   a lot of german engineers and other types came to the east during the industrial revolution that 's the silliest thing i 've ever heard . 
  the word dates back to the sixth century a.d. when germanic and slavic tribes were living together somewhere on the lower sides of the elbe river . 
  there is a huge amount of accentological evidence proving that slavic and germanic languages have had a period of mutual evolution . 
  slavic peoples refered to all foreigners as `` the mutes '' ( nemec * ski * ) or the people opposite of themselves `` the speaking '' ( slovon * ski * ) . 
  it stuck to the germans for unidentified reasons but probably because they lived togheter in those early european days . 
  i see it now . 
  i wrote warfare instead of welfare . 
  one of those weird typos . 
  i live around and with germans . 
  i get confused looks after controlled exaggerations every fucking day . 
  it 's not a stereotype , sorry . 
  but feel free to victimize yourself because you 're german if it helps you feel better . 
  that does n't make sense . 
  we 're talking about `` supranationally '' localized portals here , right ? 
  i 'm not debating the fact that there 's such a thing like google germany ... 
  i do n't even ... 
  what ?!, 
  you would have had a point if your link was google.eu, 
   no , it was n't . 
  yes , it was . 
   `` hold a kitty by its neck without someone breaking up in tears because you 're literally hitler '' that 's not jumping between extremes . 
  `` i love -30 c \u00b0 winters days more than anything else in the world but burning hot deserts are my favorite places '' is what constitutes jumping between extremes . 
  using ** obvious ** exaggeration in examples is parody and in most of the time quite humorous . 
  however it is something germans find particularly hard to understand . 
  it 's just your cultural trait . 
  [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exaggeration ) , educate yourself . 
   which was totally irrelevant to the discussion so far . 
  it 's very relevant  you tell me . 
  you 're an idiot . 
  nope , you have to long press o/u/a / s to get \u00f6 / \u00fc / \u00e4 / \u00df . 
  how many eu sites do you know and use ? 
  just the official eu ones . 
  you 're either using a global american site ( maybe translated and optimized for you but still fairly american ) or a local site . 
  there 's nothing european on the internet , nothing . 
  i did n't say anything about anglocentrism . 
  this has nothing to do with it . 
  it 's more about the fact that their search services are getting traffic no matter what . 
  they have a monopoly on information flow and they have no incentive of changing anything . 
  you do n't like google ?!, 
  who gives a shit , it 's not like you 're going to start using bing or some european search engine all of a sudden . 
  your logic is solid but you forget the fact that they are interested in profit and not in developing some specific supply to a sort of close cross european identity . 
  how many people are looking for european news accumulated from across all international news sources ? 
  probably not that much . 
  even if there was such a thing the major european countries like germany , france , the uk , etc. 
  are going to continue reading their own news making it impossible for anything euro to grow and gain profit . 
  collectively we 're already reading a ton of news in english . 
  so why change things !? 
  the eu is bigger but are the 27 eu states really a one market like the us ? 
  there 's one amazon site in the us serving all the 312 million americans and there are 5 amazon sites in europe serving 319 million europeans . 
  whatever you 're trying to say it 's very vague . 
  it was actually more of a rethorical question and i was extending its point . 
  i do n't think you actually know what jumping between extremes means . 
  and yes i expressed an opinion . 
  what ?!, 
  i think it 's naive . 
  google is a us company and in many cases very obviously so . 
  they do n't care enough about things like this . 
  for 10 years now whenever you google something in cyrillic it offers you mostly russian results ignoring the fact that not everyone who writes cyrillic is russian . 
  it 's gotten better but it 's still there . 
  [ this ] ( http://symbianlounge.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/qwertz1.jpg ) is nokia 's german virtual keyboard . 
  [ this ] ( http://fs02.androidpit.info/userfiles/30778/image/ics_tastatur.png ) is android 's . 
  `` oh you have 3 extra characters that do n't appear in the english alphabet ? 
  well , fuck you . '', 
  somebody lost his fat paycheck job at the parliament . 
  i realized i 've never heard that language . 
  it does sound like the love child of latin and arabic . 
  yeah , that 's never going to happen . 
  but it 's an awesome suggestion . 
  it would also be perfect if i would n't get only french results if i 'm just visiting france . 
  i select my prefered region and language it changes back automatically . 
  that 's so frustrating . 
  i 've eaten all kinds of meat . 
  it 's the the cook that makes all the difference . 
  i do n't notice labels anyways . 
  for me benetton is overpriced and tame . 
  holy shit they have 5 million fans on facebook . 
  glad to see none of my 900 friends is on there . 
  because it 's `` foreign '' . 
  it 's not one of `` our own '' . 
  if a german finds a law in germany to be a particular bad thing he tries to change the government . 
  if a german finds out about a shitty eu law , it automatically means the eu should dissolve and cease to exist at once . 
  animals are always `` harmed '' . 
  always . 
  you ca n't even hold a kitty by its neck without someone breaking up in tears because you 're literally hitler . 
  i generally do n't find a reason to be against animal ~ ~ warfare ~ ~ welfare but people are ridiculously irrational about it . 
  edit : welfare , i meant welfare . 
  i actually wonder how berlusconi is so hated around europe . 
  i meet so many young men who dream of being fat macho cats . 
  traditional values like having an average job , wife and kids are disappearing . 
  it only makes sense that a filthy rich old pervert like silvio is on top of things . 
  in the end of the day berlusconi is a product of capitalism in europe . 
  we think we hate him but in a sense everybody wants to be berlusconi .
