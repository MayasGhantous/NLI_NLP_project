  i 've never seen anyone wear anything by benetton . 
  it 's about image . 
  if their products begin getting taxed for causing childhood obesity it 's going to destroy 127 years of building an image . 
  they just ca n't make it seem healthy . 
  the whole `` zero '' campaign failed . 
  last new years eve two days before the 31st i wanted to buy a coke for my rum and there was a huge mountain of coke `` light '' and `` zero '' and not a single freaking regular one . 
  sold out on regular , nobody buys the `` healthier '' options . 
  i did n't buy one either . 
  i bought some imitation that had the same results . 
  i personally think that people who drink so much sugary drinks that it ruins their health are n't going to stop . 
  but it 's going to be the * last drop * for millions who only occasionally drink it . 
  i was talking about the eu commission having microsoft pushed against the wall because of some perceived `` monopoly '' that 's really a thing of the past while google and apple get a free pass to do whatever the fuck they want . 
  is microsoft not including a browser option really the biggest problem with this industry ?? 
  if you buy a computer in 2013 and have no idea how to download another browser , you 're an idiot and steve ballmer is n't responsible for that . 
  how about charging apple 1 billion for not complying with micro usb standards on their phones ? 
  how about kicking google in the balls for tracking and selling our data to third parties for ads because google.com has a monopoly on search ? 
  if you buy an android phone you are made to create a google email account and use all their services like google + and youtube and google search or gtalk . 
  why not give me an option to sign in with a hotmail.com mail , integrate with facebook , skype and have a bing bar ?? 
  those fines are complete bullshit . 
  why did you delete the thread with all the comments and submitted it anew ? 
  nah , do n't you know microsoft is the bad guy . 
  they are satan because you know zune and vista , amrite guys ?!, 
  apple and google represent everything that is good and pure in this world . 
  it just helps me be a better me . 
  i 'm more concentrated and sharp . 
  skimmed milk is the epitome of bullshit both as a matter of healthy eating and taste . 
  about 80g-100g of muesli ( whole grain no added sugar ) with a glass of milk ( 250ml ) . 
  two medium bananas or one huge one . 
  and one `` dry sandwich '' : pumpernickel slice , cottage cheese , a slice of gouda , salmon , and a fried egg on top . 
  sounds weird but it 's all in the little things - stuff like a few drops of first class olive oil on top , nice herbs for freshness , or ajvar make it all that much better . 
  i usually wash it all down with black tea ( drink my coffee when i get to work/uni ) . 
  i try to ( slowly ) eat 50g-100g of almonds 2 to 3 hours after breakfast and before lunch to complete the forenoon protein intake . 
  edit : forgot to mention my smoothies . 
  if it 's going to be a hard day i fill up my smoothie can . 
  frozen fruits , soja milk , yogurt , acacia honey ; or if i 'm extremely up to scratch i 'd make a `` melee '' smoothie with veggies , fruits , and nuts . 
  i accept your appology . 
  it was about why in some places the name comes first as opposed to the forename . 
  and please realize that words like forename and surname in english merely derive from the word name . 
  this on its own is all the proof that historically those concepts did not exists but were rather developed out of necessity as times changed . 
  `` name '' is the way the people you call `` family '' are reffered to . 
  in some countries that is also the `` surname '' in others the `` forename '' in third it 's the middlename , etc. 
  let 's say you 're british and your name is firsty middleer lastington . 
  lastington is your surname but it also happens to be your family name or `` name '' . 
  so firsty middleer lastington goes to germany or austria or hungary and people ask you to write down your `` name '' . 
  they mean you have to write down lastington . 
  they you go . 
  http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=name&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 it 's not a theory or a question of opinion . 
  it 's etymology . 
  what you do is philosophical speculation on language . 
  i find it extremely cute that you do n't know what the difference between a [ headscarf ] ( http://icovetthee.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/tumblr_lvgq1ct1kd1qgojxao1_1280.jpg ) and a [ hijab ] ( http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5241/5686747536_3a35a0f596.jpg ) is . 
  i just imagined how you walk past a girl with a [ scarf-hoodie ] ( http://i12.photobucket.com/albums/a242/almostangelic/thingsimake/vienna-hood-scarf.png ) and go `` the mosselimsts did this '' !, 
  it 's a mix of being an islamophobic assface and a dude who has no perception of female fashion . 
  well because actually the word `` name '' means what your family is called , or in a more straightforward explanation of the initial meaning , what your household is famous for ( most often the job of the head of the household ) . 
  obviously since the time this word was fixed in that meaning things have changed . 
  the forenames have obtained more importance ( showing an evolution towards individuals rather than a faceless mass of people differentiated by a token of reputation of their bloodline ) but some european languages still treat the matter traditionally ( thus the `` name '' is placed first ) . 
  my surname is just a forename turned into a surname . 
  those are typical for families that had lower social status or were called after an unpleasant moniker that had to change . 
  some would also choose a nearby geomorphological unit ( famous among german ashkenazi jews ) , a street name , or their neighbours/masters ( slaves in north & south america ) . 
  people in central asia have very similar traditions too . 
  sounds like a gay bar . . `` helsinki citi boi '' . . yep . 
  no not really . 
  the map is just a visual aid . 
  thanks for taking your time . 
  it 's all til for me . 
  as a catalan speaker which of the dialects/languages do you find hardest to understand ( besides basque ) ? 
  also is there any arabic influence in the south ? 
  wait . . it does n't mean guten morgen ?!, 
  [ it . . it ... it was sarcasm . 
  i 'm a balless gay gypsy from bulgaristan . 
  i 'm not really interested in talking to a fuckface like you though !, 
  cheers . 
  i lived in bulgaria for 19 years actually . 
  i still know a lot about the place . 
  mostly that it 's one of the shittiest places to live in europe . 
  great nature through . 
  that 's not going to go well with critics of the eu . 
  work like this is done in foreign training . 
  besides , change must come from within otherwise you 're only treating the symptoms . 
  it needs stability and time . 
  developed countries did not achieve this status over night . 
  chillax , son . 
  we 're just discussing . 
  i 'm not wasting my life for this . 
  good luck . 
  precisely . 
  dumbass . 
  `` let 's talk about real issues . 
  but let me bait all the retarded journalists by including some sensational crap in between . '', 
  redditors curing cancer and solving the world 's problems every day . 
  it does n't make economic sense since they are heavy , slow , and not equipped for rescue operations . 
  not to mention that you ca n't just borrow military machines and fly them around like a rent-a-car . 
  so it 's ok for berlusconi to call merkel `` unfuckable lardass '' because it 's the truth ?!, 
  i ca n't believe we 're even having this discussion about adults . 
  they were built by russians for blowing up shit and murdering lots of people at once ... not for saving lives . 
  that 's not how diplomacy works . 
  that 's not your everyday life . 
  things like being voted by millions of people do matter . 
  otherwise we should just fuck democracy altogether . 
  he 's being captain obvious here but a big portion of the italian nation voted for them . 
  that earns at least some restriction on the choice of words .
