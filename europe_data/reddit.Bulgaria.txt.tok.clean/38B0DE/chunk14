  i 'm angry that he does n't get in the news with some real content but this unnecessary bullshit . 
  you have helicopters to save people ?!, 
  rich bastards !, 
  in bulgaria we only have a facebook campaign demanding at least one ... for the whole country . 
  it has [ 2381 ] ( https://www.facebook.com/iskamehems ) fans . 
  we do have 72 military helicopters ... because you know ... we have to fight the talibans and the lizard people . 
  serbians stole our food again !, 
  look the names are the same - that is a proof !, 
  half my family is made of people who were expelled from western and eastern ( greek ) macedonia after the balkan wars . 
  the food my grandparents prepare is relatively unique for bulgaria and as of lately i 've been discovering it 's the same as in northern greece . 
  pretty amazing now that the boarders are open it 's only the good stuff that remains . 
  big tummies full of good stuff . 
  most of the [ world ] ( http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100725194025/lactosefreerecipes/images/f/ff/lactase_intolerance_world_map.png ) . 
  milk products are virtually unknown east of the himalayas . 
  other parts of greece are different ? 
  the bulgarian `` sirene '' ** only ** refers to ~ ~ feta ~ ~ brined cheese like the feta . 
  yellow cheese is called [ `` kashkaval '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kashkaval ) ( \u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b ) . 
  which apparently derives from italian . 
  also there is just one type of yellow cheese in bulgaria . 
  there 's no gouda or cheddar or used french socks cheese . 
  just straightforward kashkaval , yellow cheese . 
  there are 50 manufacturers per capita and they all taste differently but it 's all just called kashkaval . 
  romanian journalists should learn to give a source . 
  yes . 
   south koreans and japanese became wealthy by excluding foreigners from their labour markets . 
  that 's a really fascinating insight of the psychotic mind of the modern racist . 
  the idea of economic growth based on employment shortages is amazing ... ly stupid . 
  you need labor and that 's hard to get cheaply and plentifully in a democracy . . or you know a `` fair '' society . 
  the rural s. koreans paid for this supposed `` wealth '' . 
  the s. korean 's government has had a very oppressive control on labor . 
  s. korea 's tyrannical governments have always looked a bit better because of their bat-shit crazy neighbors . 
  it also started changing [ relatively late ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/june_29_declaration ) on . 
  ca n't speak for japan ( although their policies have served as examples to the rest of the region ) but s. korea is definitely not ethnically homogeneous and foreigner free as people like it to be . 
  you compare but you do not equate standards . 
  their labor market is whoring out for trained foreigners since the early 90s . 
  ca n't bother to search for a source but there are a lot of ( also muslims in the face of malaysians ) foreigner labor force filling up jobs in s. korea . 
  s. korea has been having labor shortages and besides having insane wage and union restrictions they 've been importing a ton of foreigners . 
  and it 's only going to increase with time because s. korean society is evolving towards a real democracy . 
  while i was in korea people told me there 's no hiv there because koreans do not fuck with foreigners . 
  i had a lot of sex in that country . 
  so yeah , all those hypotheses seem legit but they fail miserably in reality . 
  direct racism is for subhumans . 
  white people are better than that . 
  we only upvote intelligently expressed general intolerance that simply * suggests * power to the obviously better ~ ~ race ~ ~ culture ( which is only by coincidence not black or brown or dark or not pale or muslim ) . 
  gays are ok , because homophobia would make us seem so third world . 
  you serbians never learn . 
  this brings me to an idea for the majority in this reddit who want to get rid of the foreigners , gypsies , jews , muslims , multiculturalists ( sorry if i missed someone ) the people that are truly responsible for everything bad in our otherwise perfect european world . 
  become extremely poor . 
  nobody would want to visit you if there were n't jobs and security here . 
  griko language . 
  no other language comes even close . 
  he probably wants to secure a successor while he 's still alive and kicking . 
  he wants to make sure his successor is not going to `` modernize '' the global pedophile cartel . 
  have there ever been latin american popes ? 
  that would be fair to them , i think . 
  actually i do n't care . 
  lazy germans , ca n't finish a job . . always nagging about holidays and workload . 
  oh r/europe , you 're a fucking nazi rally . 
  i feel like i 'm talking to the radio here . 
  i 'm glad your people reelected him and i hope he 's going to take part in the conversation , even just to piss you off . 
  disagreing with a political view point or career of a politician does n't make their opinion any less educated or relevant . 
  we have enough really dumb politicians in europe and we should at least appreciate some higher state of thought process . 
  that old monarch with the weird hats is a dumb piece of tradition that no one should take seriously in any political context other than being a symbol for british-english nationalism . 
  do n't compare him to it . 
  i 'd take gr\u00edmsson 's opinion over that cunt any day . 
  your president is a pretty big european intellectual figure , has a phd in economics and was the country 's first polsci professor . 
  well , it 's a 40c \u00b0 beach town and there are no restrictions on clothing . 
  most do n't walk around fully naked but there 's little left on . 
  your friend is exaggerating or sharing his teenage wet dreams . 
  if there 's an intoxicated girl walking around she needs help and people are going to call emergency services . 
  believe me , nobody there needs a dead or raped tourist news stories going around europe . 
  it 's weird how you 're all super elitist about retarded memes but this shit ... this shit gets upvoted . 
  as someone who has worked as a tourist animator for swedes ( in sunny beach , bulgaria ) i can tell you it 's an awesome job . 
  if you 're sociable and like partying a lot - it will be the time of your life . 
  you will however need to learn how to stand your drink . 
  if you consume everything they do through the whole 10 weeks of the season - you will die . 
  you will also hate sun , sand , electronic music , hot girls , and red bull by the end of it . 
  you also might develope some dementia from the lack of sleep . 
  the reputation for swedish tourists is that they get on a plane to bulgaria , get drunk on the plane and wake up 10 days later in their bed back in sweden with a lobster red tan and some pretty crazy photos on their camera . 
  mussolini did reject the racial doctrines of the nazis . 
  how could n't he , italians can never be a `` nordic race '' . 
  that 's the only freaking reason . 
  it 's 1954 here . 
  it tells you all about the quality of our socialists when they fight to the last drop of blood to build some inflated backwards russian npp , and all that stops it are some pseudo conservatives ( with a chairman who is simultaneously the head of the mafia ) , that ca n't get their corruption river-flows as good as the `` socialists '' so to have enough motivation to pursue any big project in the energy sector . 
  building a npp ? 
  do n't make me laugh !, 
  we 're talking about a country that is so full of shit it ca n't finish 100 km of highway for over 23 years !, 
  i fucking hate my retarded country . 
  how many generations should filter through until we could finally have some normal center left and center right political representation ? 
  on a related note i wonder what bullshit argument the `` eu is for christians '' crowd are going to come up with in regards to albania and bosnia & herzegovina . 
  i believe they had nothing positive to draw about bulgaria so they just made a tractor and grapes . 
  things that they could 've used : [ roses ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rosa_%c3%97_damascena#cultivation ) , [ yogurt ] ( http://www.lbbulgaricum.bg/c/en/healthy-nutrition/the-bulgarian-yoghurt/history-of-bulgarian-yoghurt/ ) , a beach , [ gaida ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaida ) , [ kukeri ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukeri ) , [ martenitsa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/martenitsa ) , [ rila monastery ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rila_monastery ) , a [ shopska salad ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shopska_salad ) , [ thracian artifacts ] ( https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=d&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=thracian+artifacts&amp;oq=thracian+artifacts&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0.753.753.0.1772.1.1.0.0.0.0.102.102.0j1.1.0.les%3b..0.0...1c.1.8tw5mgoskuc&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.41524429,d.yms&amp;fp=47466aec37c0b12c&amp;biw=1364&amp;bih=707 ) . 
  but no , bulgaria - tractor and grapes . 
  ok . poor people do n't have personalities anyway , amrite guys !? 
  i should be thankful we 're not a knee-over-a-whole toilet again !, 
  wow not a single racist psycho anti-eu comment !, 
  not to mention the fact that people in bulgaria get the brains beaten out of their mouths by security personal on the streets , at bars , or clubs all the fucking time . 
  there are at least 3 death-by-security every month in that cannibalistic country of ours . 
  a guy i know spent 5 months in coma and is now paralyzed with quarter of his mental capacity because a security guy did n't like the way he looked at him . 
  he has n't spent a fucking day in prison .
