  we 're a violent nation and there 's very little consequences for anyone who can bribe himself out of legal trouble . 
  and because our courts have never had anything to do with honor you can do that very cheaply over here . 
  but hey they kick an assassin in the face a few times and it 's `` inhumane '' . 
  i can live in a 40m \u00b2 place by myself , no problem . 
  depends on the needs of the people . 
  an average european family of four needs more than 75m \u00b2 . 
  120m \u00b2 is definitely on the bigger side of the scale but there are still enough people here who live in houses with gardens . 
  my grandparents ' house has 500m \u00b2 garden space . 
  that adds up to the average ( i would suggest ) . 
  i 'd say , yes . 
  if i continued to live home i 'd end up in the national news for murdering my family . 
  leaving home to pursue my own life when 19 was the best decision of my life . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i love my folks ... but spending too much time together in that 120m \u00b2 appartment ( average household in bulgaria ) is torture . 
  how do you people do that ?!, 
  how do you fucking date or have any social life at all ? 
  they already `` lose '' millions with providing the students and elderly with big price cuts . 
  like every other place in europe . 
  it 's called social sustainability . 
  it will encourage more people to travel less by car . 
  less pollution , congestions , accidents . 
  less space taken up for parking . 
  i wonder what kind of impact it would have on rent . 
  one would be able to get a cheaper place on the outskirts of a city without worrying mobility would cost a fortune . 
  that would surely loosen up segregation as more `` central '' and expensive apartments would become cheaper and others more expensive . 
  not really an expert here , obviously . 
  it mainly tries to achieve more sustainable transportation . 
  basically the more people use pub . 
  trans . 
  the better it will get . 
  if there were less cars we could actually center cities more around minimum resource , pollution , noise , and lower maintenance transportation . 
  in most big cities there 's already a strong tendency towards alternatives to everyone owning their own car . 
  this article is complete bullshit running down the bullshit media train . 
  taken out of context . 
  he said that it 's her advantage but not his disadvantage that she is popular with female voters . 
  his point was about being popular not automatically meaning you 're a good politician and that everyone will vote for you . 
  why is this relevant to r/europe ? 
  from the latin `` calendae '' , same origin of calender . 
  which itself comes from calare or to bring news or a good word . 
  one of the stronger hypotheses is that it comes from a sanskrit word for a sun god . 
  before jesus people celebrated the rebirth of the sun ( because of the winter solstice ) . 
  does n't berlusconi 's lifestyle pose a bigger thread to the `` foundations '' of family life and all that serious jazz ? 
  do heterosexual women and men look up to gay people or other heterosexual women and men , mostly those who are successful and prominent in society ? 
  why would i want to settle down and have a normal family life if i know i could be fucking tight young pussy well in my 70s and society will choose me to lead them ? 
  personally i do n't look up to gay people or old perverts when i think about marriage and kids . 
  i certainly do n't think about any fucking religion . 
  i think about relevant things like my parents ' and other close people 's relationships . 
  they say that a lot about things that want to change . 
  brits talk a lot about sick when they try to describe foreign food . 
  we treat hangover with [ a soup ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%b0%c5%9fkembe ) made of a pig 's stomach . 
  and yes , it works . 
  when somebody eats finger food with a fork and a knife i always feel like a savage . 
  a lot of bulgarians drink coffee in [ those ] ( http://galeya.bg/system/images/for_partner/big/image_3328.jpg ) . 
  it 's trully horrible . 
  this will sound sarcastic but i am serious . 
  you should read mein kampf . 
  people have had those thoughts hundreds of years before you were even born and they 've all failed and been proven wrong . . but that does n't stop you somehow . 
  so i say just go out and educate yourself about the stuff you believe in . 
  why leave all the good stuff out ? 
  because people tell you it 's wrong ? 
  no , it 's your decision , it 's your choice , do n't let anyone stop you . 
  do n't bend under social pressure and just embrace who you really are . 
  mein kampf has a ton of powerful thoughts on multiculturalism that you are going to absolutely fall in love with and probably enrich this magnificent belief system you have decided to chose to have . 
  really , i 'm not sarcastic . 
  go out and read that book . 
  thank me later . 
   i 'm not racist because i refuse to recognize the people i hate as a race . 
  i hate them because they have different and obviously inferior teeth so i really am a teethist . 
  which is clearly some bullshit philosophical term that is nowhere near as negatively impregnated as `` racism '' . 
  the issue is really about dumb people who ca n't get it through their fucking heads that racism is a term that has long grown over just being about race . 
  not only because the concept of `` race '' is as unscientific and undefinable as `` culture '' but also because racists have a great motivation to do anything in their bullshit power to not be called racists . 
  they get more recognition posing as something `` completely '' different . 
   i 'm not racist , i hate people for * real * reasons , get it ? 
  people are different , there will always be new fucking distinctive bullshit terms . 
  when antimulticulturalism becomes loaded negatively they will probably just jump on the next one . 
  neo-nazis got smart and stopped using distinct clothes and styles . 
  they started using mass culture and modern average shit to get across and it worked wonders for their cause . 
  the people who want to destroy democracy cry the hardest when someone tries to take their `` rights '' away . 
  that 's how you recognize racists and bigots - they do n't fucking believe in the medium they 're using , for them it 's just a transitional thing they are abusing to prove it wrong . 
  just like all those intelligent-wanna-be discussions about multiculturalism , multiethnicism , and blab blab fucking blab . 
  racism is an umbrella term that incorporates all that human herd behavior it 's us against them . 
  any idea that someone is terminally made inferior/superior is racism . 
  except maybe sexism . . but only because it has the word sex in it , and well . . 
  sex we all know what that is . 
  not only have i met with those people you call gypsy , i 've worked with romani children since i 'm 17 . 
  i know this vicious cycle that you 're propagating since i can remember . 
  i do n't even pretend to not see through your predictable teenage racism even before you open your coward mouth , you little piece of shit . 
  this is r/europe . 
  it 's like asking why people hate jews in r/hitlerisawesome . 
  do you like to read ? 
  try this . 
  i for one think that rich people need our protection against this communist freak . 
  we should really take example from the americans and the nazis and add more theatrics to the whole thing , to make it interesting so a 53 year old retard pm and all the comparable dipshits would n't be bored . 
  ~ ~ can you post the relevant video and not just the whole site ? ~ ~ ~ ~ if he 's not just looking down , this will be gold . ~ ~ ** edit : he 's not [ sleeping ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sxwuwwehby&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=49m30 ) he 's just looking down . 
  op , you darn liar . 
  ** ** edit2 : a [ shit storm ] ( http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=145937 ) is coming !,

  thanks for the laugh . 
  nah , you 're just very easily offended .
