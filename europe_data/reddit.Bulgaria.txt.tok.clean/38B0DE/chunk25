  200,000 people . 
  those who remained were obviously only able to if they could and `` became '' greeks . 
  we have cousins in greece like this . 
  we visited them and went to the the village of my grandmothers that still stands empty in the mountains , the houses slowly rotting away in the time . 
  although we are close family , they know and recognize the history , they do n't feel like bulgarians the slightest . 
  it 's not hard to see how the people who remained were only able to because they gave up their identity , names , languages , etc. 
  but as i said that is beyond my point . 
  we have bulgaria and macedonia as an example where this will inevitably lead . 
  macedonian is a dialect of bulgarian that was forcefully created into a separate language in order to pass it as a real country . 
  i do n't want to dispute macedonia 's sovereignty but the existence of macedonian as a a separate language is a lie . 
  on the scale of dialects macedonian is very close to bulgarian , even today after a few generation of brainwashing . 
  it used to be much more closer than most dialects are to the universal language in italy , germany , gb or spain . 
  hell , bavarian has a thousand times less things in common with standard german . 
  my grandmother 's family is part of the macedonians greece expelled after wwi . 
  she and her siblings speak the dialect from before anyone ever tried to push it as its own language . 
  as a proud and sadly one of the last members of that community they say macedonian being its own language is crazy and against all logic . 
  the really sad part of it all is that because this historic injustice was done to bulgarians and macedonians i want to see it happen to all so called `` yugoslavs '' too . 
  just of pure spite and vengeance . 
  solidarity with eastern europe ? 
  not a lot of you out there . 
  that is such a bulgarian comment . 
  we give zero fucking shits for graphic design . 
  we hate it . 
  logo is for pederast . 
   ex-communist that still does n't explain the difference between other states who were communist like romania . 
  it was specifically two things - bulgaria had very close cultural and political ties with russia ( although part of the axis not a single bulgarian soldier was sent to fight the soviet union ) and bulgarians fully embraced the red army occupation . 
  to this day bulgarians still live in denial and call it a `` liberation '' . 
  not to mention that georgi dimitrov was one of the very few high ranking communists in europe who stalin had n't had killed and he actually hand picked him to be bulgaria 's communist `` leader '' ( dictator ) . 
  for 18 months after the end of wwii bulgaria was in the grip of a ** severe ** full scale unhinged stalin style purge . 
  a lot people were murdered in fast pace convictions at the beginning after that they let the pretending of sentencing and people just `` disappeared '' . 
  anybody from politicians , nazi sympathizers , though owners of factories and businesses , to actors and intellectuals . 
  the church was hit hard . 
  the list of disappeared priests is long and goes from mere village fathers to the metropolitan bishops . 
  basically anybody could walk to a church kill the priest and call it `` cleaning of nazi collaborators '' and he 'd be a hero . 
  the bulgarian `` bourgeois '' and anybody who had something to with them was completely wiped or left the country . 
  if you were a painter and you spent a year in germany studying the brush you were shot dead or sent to a camp . 
  the irony of it all was that although bulgaria was part of the axis all of its jewish population survived thanks to among other things big efforts by the bulgarian orthodox church . 
  but because jews were also `` part of the bourgeois '' their community suffered and were persecuted under the red army occupation . 
  even the man who is most credited with the survival of the bulgarian jews [ dimitar peshev ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimitar_peshev ) barely survived . 
  the bulgarian church was reduced to absolute nothingness and even fell in the control of the party , crawling with spies and kgb operatives , under the direct control of the party . 
  the bulgarian communist party even decided who to be the head of the church !, 
  which after the fall of communism led to the splitting of the bulgarian church which was only resolved in 2013 . 
  so basically the bulgarian orthodox church is like a big 1000 year old tree that was chopped down and is now just a sprout , growing in tough times to be a tree . 
   gypsy healers as a bulgaria i 've never heard of anything that would even come close to this . 
  sounds like an extremely profane and ignorant interpretation . 
  you 're like one of those people who goes to africa comes back tells everybody people there all have severely burnt skin . 
   [ romanian people 's salvation cathedral ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanian_people%27s_salvation_cathedral ) will become the largest and tallest orthodox church in the world when completed, 
  the netherlands and ruhrpott region is the bangladesh of europe . 
  actually i 'm giving you perspective . 
  i 'm giving you a reason to put the pitchforks down and think about it . 
  it 's a myth that children hurting ( and when i say hurting as a word i mean it encompasses everything from hitting to brutal killing ) animals are some fucked up psychopaths . 
  it happens . 
  of course it 's not `` normal '' . 
  of course they have to be punished . 
  but it being a sign of deep psychological deviation ? 
  extremely rarely . 
  and the children themselves are the least to blame . 
  it 's parents , environment , culture , circumstance , etc. 
  children are among the most vulnerable members of society . 
  the law protects children until they are deemed to be able to interact in society as adults . 
  for this reason children are treated differently from adults by the criminal justice system . 
  people are more complex than a simple question of `` normal '' vs not normal . 
  we are not just born into what we are , it takes a long and complicated process to be a person . 
  and it 's important . 
  and a lot of the steps come and go and are forgotten . 
  and it is absolutely ** central ** for you to forget this stuff and be absolutely convinced you 're a normal caring person who 'd never do things like those kids . 
  but the truth is if you saw a frame by frame video of your childhood you will be shocked how much things happen that you as an adult now think are absolutely despicable and outrageous . 
  greek banter level has gone up dealing with the whole crisis . 
  we need to invest in banter boys !, 
  that 's a myth . 
  children hurting animals are not future psychopaths . 
  repeated offenders and children that express pleasure from it is a different thing . 
  but in those cases it 's also very rarely a sing of a future psychopath . 
  more a sign of abuse and serious problems at home . 
  less than 5 % of people are psychopaths and it is extremely rare that it would present itself that early . 
  i saw some documentary about the worst juvenile criminals in this one high security juvenile prison . 
  they had a 14 year old who raped his own mother . 
  they found out he had been raping his sister for years . 
  his mother confessed he raped a goat at age 6 . 
  now that thing is a demon . 
  still it was pointed out kids like this are extremely rare . 
  also this kind of behavior is more common than you think . 
  a lot of people have childhood experience of hurting animals and or other children . 
  this is how we learn empathy and consequence of violence . 
  some more serious than others but it has to do with circumstance . 
  it has more to do with children testing boundaries and parents not correcting them . 
  this means 10 % difference and mere 5 % tilt . 
  two thirds of those are `` undecided '' , swing vote ( which is going to be much higher this time around as we have less `` do n't knows '' who will predominantly go towards leave ) . 
  votes that close get decided by the `` undecided '' and those are the people who are the aim of the propaganda . 
  my comment was about how obviously brutal the propaganda is going to be seeing as articles like these are emerging strong even 2-3 years before any referendum . 
  what counts is the `` do n't knows '' and `` undecided '' and there 's plenty of evidence those are atm going strongly towards leave ( not sure it was `` remain - leave '' like brexit but that 's what i 'm going to call it ) . 
  what changed obviously is brexit and that initial rhetoric ( as presented in this article and the obvious shill comments around reddit ) wants to pretend like scottish euroscepticism is going to be the deciding factor . 
  like `` euroscepticism '' everywhere it stems from strong nationalistic groups which correct me if i 'm wrong are not a loyalist group in scotland . 
  even if they were , nationalistic groups and loyalist do not make a significant part of the `` undecided '' do n't know crowd . 
  also the `` euroscepticism '' argument does n't work because we all know how scots voted in brexit . 
  also plenty of the people who desire independence voted remain because they want to stay in the eu . 
  that huge argument has been eliminated . 
  the `` plenty '' 5 % who tilted the scale are gone now . 
  plenty i tell you plenty . 
  man the english are going to throw all their shit and propaganda at this .
