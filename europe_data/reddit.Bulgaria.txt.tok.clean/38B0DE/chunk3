  the mormon experienced similar pogroms like the european jews . 
  forget `` integration '' people should just learn to live together and not kill each other . 
  equal under the laws and human rights . 
  that 's it . 
  that 's a hard question . 
  nation building is very different between the new and the old world even if it was parallel and interconnected . 
  the americas are countries of immigrants or at least people feel like it whereas europeans feel like from the beginning of time they 've always been here and always been who they are . 
  american 's symbol of the nation are the constitution and independence from colonial subjugation wheras in europe it 's ethnicity , language , religious identification . 
  in that sense it 's easier or possible to become an american whereas you ca n't magically change your ethnicity . 
  that 's just my guess . 
  yes and i truly sympathize with all those americans who say `` i 'm italian american '' or `` i 'm half irish '' or `` i 'm 1/589th cherokee '' . 
  they are like those people who still do n't realized someone is dead and are looking for them . 
  it 's gone man . 
  let it go . 
  you 're not italian . 
  go drink a bud light and measure distance in body parts . 
  i know a cameroonian girl who decided to go to bulgaria for a internship . 
  came back just 3 weeks later . 
  apparently people taunted her with monkey chants and screams on the street until she just packed up and left . 
  so . . you know . . there 's that . 
  it 's not hard to understand why germans still believe they live in an extremely open and tolerant society . 
  they compare themselves with us . 
   no worries . 
  youre bulgarian so i do n't think there is a problem with it . 
  yeah , my african and asian friends ( who can talk about this kind of stuff ) all say me being bulgarian ( white european ) is like magical `` no problem '' in comparison with them . 
  they are clueless about that though haha . 
  so i 'm going to guess you 're asian or african studying or working in europe ? 
  by this conversation i mean this . 
   this chinese girl i know is getting her ph.d. and she said she chose the us because `` in germany , i am chinese first , a ph.d. holder second . 
  in the us , nobody cares that i am chinese , only that i have a ph.d. '' i do n't really understand your questions . 
  what do you mean with `` outsiders '' ? 
  foreigners ? 
  as long as you 're different you 're target for all kinds of shit . 
  anywhere , anytime . 
  that includes work related issues . 
  even germans with really old-timey weird sounding names are taken for foreigners and have it harder . 
  friendly fire , hilarious . 
  a study showed that people with non-german names have to send out 18 times more job applications than germans with the same educational background . 
  that says it all . 
  i 'm currently based in germany . 
  i should prolly get a different flair . 
  i saw your comments with slusny_cizinec i think i get why it 's confusing . 
  \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 ( his ) , \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044f ( hers ) , \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435 ( its ) , \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 ( their ) are used in cases of belonging to the subject . 
  \u0441\u0438 is short form of all those . 
  \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 is used mostly in front of the noun , very rarely or only in poetic form after it . 
  \u0441\u0438 is never used in front of the noun and that may have something to do with the suffixed definite articles in bulgarian that make it different from the other slavic languages ( except macedonian ) that do n't have articles . 
  because the short form \u0441\u0438 ca n't be suffixed . 
  if they were to use \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044f instead of \u0441\u0438 it would have to be suffixed with the definite article not the noun so it comes first . 
   they seem to want to become american and know they will be accepted if they chose to do so , which is not the case in all european nations . 
  ca n't say anything about the first part but the second part is painfully true . 
  i have one of those conversations at least once a week . 
  what barbarians , eh ? 
  hang em all like animals , that 'll show them how not barbaric europe is . 
  disclaimer . 
  everybody who tells me that is n't the best solution is communist gay vagina hitler that ruins europe . 
  americans assimilate , europeans integrate . 
  thought i agree with the intended `` superficial occupation '' and emotional side sense , but was it really an `` occupation '' ? 
  do n't forget september 9th , zveno , and kimon georgiev . 
  we switched sides before the end of the war and were consequently invaded by the red army with least amount of resistance . 
  that invasion 's influence and the post-war chaos lasted 18 months . 
  afterwards we were more than happy to be the most loyal satellite state in the ussr . 
  that 's not an occupation itself . 
  bulgaria could very well remain communist but split the unbelievably narrow ties but it felt natural to everybody that we do n't . 
  the high level of legitimization of our ussr role was kept high up until the mid 80s . 
  why are you asking ? 
  that 's a lot of fucking milk yo . 
  someone should make a post about what european countries are number one at . 
  that would be an exiting post . 
  we could make a map with the things we 're leading at within the boarders . 
  sure they had to rebuild and did a great job but a lot of times it feels like a fake tourist-y theme park rather than some old traditional place . 
  also rebuilding was cherry picking . 
  frankfurt decided to not rebuild their [ jewish ghetto ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frankfurter_judengasse ) which deleted a ton of real history but kept the traditional city planning which is insane . 
  the real pearls in germany are the small towns outside of the big cities . 
  or sofia . 
  i know it 's probably the ugliest european capital but it 's nonetheless full of stuff you can do . 
  not * everything * is old . 
  big german cities are quite new . 
  germans met some decisions which let to some events and in the late 40s most german cities like frankfurt am main which had the biggest medieval `` old city '' part anywhere in europe had to start from scratch . 
  you can find hundreds of passed out people at oktoberfest . 
  the ambulance corps take care of as much as they can . 
  they hang numbers on them like corpses . 
  but not all are helped and that 's where a lot of rapists assault . 
  99 % of it goes unreported and you can be sure this is not the only person that is going to be raped at oktoberfest 2014 . 
  a close friend of mine ( she 's 24 ) came back from oktoberfest last year with bruises all over her body from groping . 
  her shoulders , breast parts , and neck had red and blue marks all over . 
  some of them were 4cm big . 
  it looked painful as hell . 
  no i get this but given the context of it and the subreddit it 's on i thought euro would make more sense . 
  nobody wants to stay in bulgaria . 
  and why is it in us dollars ?!, 
  maybe some think those sound alike . 
  rus ( \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044b\u0435 ) also means a [ hair color ] ( https://www.google.ru/search?q=%d0%a0%d1%83%d1%81%d1%8b%d0%b5&amp;newwindow=1&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=673&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=lamiviielog_ywohkigidw&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq ) . 
  the article is n't saying anything about slav migration , slav culture , greeks , greek history , or alexander the great . 
  it is about macedonians who voice concerns over being called slavs . 
  which i am saying is n't as far fetched as you all are trying to make it . 
  i am in no way saying this means alexander the great was a slav macedonian . 
  as a bulgarian personally i find it understandable . 
  i do n't like to be called slav or slavic either . 
  sounds like it 's not wrong but it 's not right either . 
  we ( balkans ) build our own distinct group and identity of which the slavic languages and culture are a big part but the main point here is distinct .
