  how else would you explain somebody liking bulgaria ? 
  yes . 
  bulgaria and russia practically interchangeable . 
  how else would you explain somebody liking bulgaria ?!, 
  bulgaria was actually bought by russia and everybody was told to vote for them . 
  the song is about how gay and nazi europe is . 
  clearly . 
  [ got your privilege checked ?

  did they cut and took away his mic at the end ( awkwardly covering the empty mic stand with a flag ) because he spoke out against `` disposable '' music ? 
  edit : [ video ] ( https://youtu.be/ehh0_uxtqly?t=3h43m22s ) thanks to rerecursing !, 
   quality music no . 
  edit : lol welp congrats portugal . . 
  this `` ban '' has to do with the fact that cinema companies lobby the board of directors of the festival to exclude movies from online streaming giants because they are scared . 
  they are so very scared . 
  this is a good sign because the fear shows that competition is working . 
  the whole cinema industry needs a wake up call that will do us all good . 
  netflix is to cinemas what uber is to taxis . 
  cinemas will be made to evolve or die out . 
  this is good for the consumer .

  edit : do you have a recipe for that ? 
  it 's for a friend . 
  supremacy of bulgarian [ `` burek '' form ] ( http://desiybg.com/images/%ef%f0%e0%e2%e0%20%e1%e0%ed%e8%f7%ea%e0%20%f1%20%ea%f0%e5%ed%e2%e8%f0%f8.jpg ) ** confirmed ** edges bring over 9000 times more puff pastry crunchiness . 
  also spinach ?! ... 
  sad !, 
  you will never learn . 
  it 's also called \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 you westbalkan barbarians . 
  one of my ex colleagues served for 10 years in the bundeswehr . 
  besides being gay he was an average guy . 
  i went to a birthday party at his house and saw lots of stuff from his army time . 
  he gave me a photo album because i was asking question . 
  one of the photos was a huge swastika made out of tree branches like a wreath . 
  it was about half the size of a person and done really well , like it probably took someone a long time to craft it . 
  and it looked seriously aggressive , like really quality branch hand work . 
  and he and others standing in front of it huddled together , laughing , making the hitler hand thing . 
  he said it was a practical joke at one of the camping trainings or whatever . 
  a weird joke to come from a german . 
  and a soldier in duty at that . 
  it 's illegal in so many levels . 
  and he put the photo in an album . 
  just so freaking weird . 
  when i asked him if there are nazis in the bundeswehr he said `` the army attracts lots of patriotic people but it 's frowned upon to be full blown nazi '' . 
  blew my mind this `` patriotic people '' and `` frowned upon '' . 
  it 's just so shocking to me how light hearted he seemed to be taking it . 
  seemed like it came from a place where nazi stuff is taken really light hearted , like the internal bundeswehr culture has a very soft approach to nazism . 
  completely untypical for germany . 
  this is why i included the quote about aristotle . 
  it is considered to be the father of all western constitutions . 
  [ i do n't know how homosexuality comes in on this ?! ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/post-38498-obama-dafuq-gif-imgur-what-the-ui0m.gif ) . . 
  but yes ... homosexuality was n't a new thing in the 18th century because it was n't new . 
  the only people shocked are the people who voted leave and are now starting to think about the real consequences . 
  just a heads up . 
  by doing this `` we were the first and only and everybody is just imitating us '' lie you 're actually imitating colonial european powers . 
  brought to you by the rich and powerful taste of irony . 
  which by the way was invented by american \u2122 scientists after wwii ( which americans \u2122 won singlehandedly ) to combat nazi communists . 
   a radical new thing nope , ^ ^ ^ ^ edit it was n't new or radical ^ ^ ^ ^ edit . 
  there were civilizations with codified laws in mesopotamia as early as 2300 bc . 
  from wikipedia : * aristotle ( ca 350 bc ) was the first to make a formal distinction between ordinary law and constitutional law , establishing ideas of constitution and constitutionalism , and attempting to classify different forms of constitutional government . 
  the most basic definition he used to describe a constitution in general terms was `` the arrangement of the offices in a state '' . 
  in his works constitution of athens , politics , and nicomachean ethics he explores different constitutions of his day , including those of athens , sparta , and carthage . 
  * from that tradition the byzantines created the most influential constitution to modern day the [ `` corpus juris civilis '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corpus_juris_civilis ) . 
  which is also the fundamentals on which even the catholic canons are based . 
   what really concerns me is the apparent lack of good will coming from both sides . 
  good will ?!, 
  great britain 's leaving is extremely bad for the eu , it 's endangering its whole existence . 
  if you put someone in the corner do n't be surprised if they fight back really hard . 
  i want to see a version of this song with polandball ... with real music ... with real accents . 
  oh god ... 
  m'cronies and mccros, 
  albania is the hidden jewel of europe actually . 
  pretty amazing coastline . 
  imagine a turkish top gun style movie with greeks being the hated bad guys with their asshole leader * el \u011eree\u00c7\u00d6 * fighting allah fearing hot shot m\u00d6verikalim . 
  turkish tom cruise . 
  damn . 
  as far as i understand dogfight does n't necessarily mean shooting . 
  it involves `` chasing away '' which is a fight to get in a firing position and make the enemy retreat . 
  it involves all kinds of risk eg a pilot crashing . 
  everyone is bickering about which nato jets are better and i 'm just standing here being glad they 're not russian . 
  small steps away from that crippling russian influence . 
  you should get our old migs paint them green , yellow and black and sell them to jamaica or something . 
  she 's been through much , much worse crap . 
  she had to take silvio `` merkel is an unfuckable lardass '' berlusconi seriously . 
  who should post it so it 's not hilarious to you cunt ? 
  wow so progressive , truly a milestone for women . 
   bulgarians have a thing after mile kiti\u0107 i think it 's because he 's such an alpha but he 's also a deep thinker and a good person for liking fatties . 
  at first i thought `` is this guy calling us fat '' than i saw most of the youtube comments are in bulgarian . 
  sometimes i feel so much out of the loop ... 
  i 'm too much out of balkan, 
  there were 3 notes on the ground . 
  there were two fake ones online . 
  it now has the status of the red cross and the vatican . 
  i 've been going around the balkans every summer for the last few years and i ca n't say i 've felt it . 
  but statistic data is different . 
  it 's about what you can learn from comparing about the social reality of people . 
  specifically the mid part of the greek-bulgarian boarder , the rhodope mountain is one of my favorite places because people there are so much nicer and the nature is superb . 
  it 's a different dimension . 
  if you like this kind of `` bio '' tourism visit smolyan and go southeast to the zlatograd region and then gradually proceed south ( there 's a road connecting the two countries there now ) to lake vistonida . 
  aw thanks but i wanted to make a point that we 're actually super emotional just in a very sad angry kind of way . 
  young people are typically positive , drink and fuck around a lot , also run away from that horrid place .
