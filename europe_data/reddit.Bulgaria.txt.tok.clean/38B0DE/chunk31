  the criminals are doing pretty great . 
  everybody else is just waiting to die . 
  as the economist once [ declared ] ( http://www.economist.com/node/17722557 ) : bulgaria is the saddest place ( relative to its income ) . 
  that 's a sign of higher emotional sensitivity , maybe because we 're trying ( in vain ) to be a part of a rich people 's club who call us `` the biggest mistake ever '' . 
  i thought emotional was about both positive and negative . 
  there are 4 questions about different positive emotions and then all the negative are put together in one . 
   `` were you treated with respect all day yesterday ? '', 
  if that 's one of the questions it is clear bulgaria would score so low . 
  if there was a counter question like `` did people treat you like shit all day yesterday and the last ten years but you do n't give a fuck because you do n't see your life improving in the near or far future anyway ? '', 
  we would have scored much higher !, 
  some relevant news stories : [ bbc ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20508075 ) , [ france24 ] ( http://www.france24.com/en/20121127-hundreds-tractors-descend-brussels-milk-protest ) , [ reuters ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/26/us-eu-milk-protest-idusbre8ap0w820121126 ) . 
  precisely . 
  insisting on analog print is irrational . 
  it 's the reading that 's important . 
  i would even go as far as to say that we should ditch analog books in schools whatsoever . 
  if we add audio and video to the learning process we solve a lot of problems . 
  not to mention how much easier it would be if say text books were as available as mp3 . 
  while i do agree on some level , this guy is too sensationalist . 
  europe has too much states that have been cannibalizing each other for centuries . 
  we live in a liberal post-war society that puts much more value on aggressive cooperation rather than aggressive competition . 
  i think the future belongs with free dynamic urban populations that will achieve a inter-everything ( international , inter-racial , inter-cultural , etc. ), 
  identities that we today ca n't really imagine . 
  that does not mean the end of nation-states - it 's the next stage . 
  evolution , in a sense . 
  as well as another bunch of other languages . 
  what about irlandia ? 
  what a coward . 
  nice , thanks . 
  carmen kass is in a movie ? 
  fuck yes :o, 
  nah , i 'm so racist i think all brown people are islamists . 
  it would be awesome if there was a possibility to watch any movie from any european country with good subtitles . 
  i 'd pay a couple of euros to stream them on my pc . 
  i mean they are n't coming to a cinema around me ( i live in a big city in the middle of europe ) so they might as well stream them here . 
  if they can get 1 million europeans to see their movie for $ 3 e.g. 
  they could finance their next project . 
  just a wild idea . 
  so we 're hindu now ?!, 
  i do n't get it . 
  russians perceive mortality differently . 
  which is part of the reason those videos are all around . 
  my dad was in moscow recently and witnessed a car crash , where bodies would lay around and people would film with their phones like it 's something super normal . 
  officials would come and not even put a blanket on the bodies . 
  it 's like they do n't have any respect for death whatsoever . 
  that would be different in france or germany . 
  the other guy could pull a gun on them any second . 
  consanguineous marriage in turkey is persistent with european average . 
  there 's a strong stereotype stating the opposite that comes from the fact that most middle eastern muslim countries have a huge problem with cousins procreating . 
  in saudi arabia more than 50 % of all marriages are consanguineous . 
  fun fact . 
  only bulgaria , macedonia , serbia and croatia have a ban on first cousins marriage in europe . 
  you can tell the data on ee is bullshit because it is n't anywhere near the complexity of we . 
  but it 's nothing new , nobody gives a flying fuck about ee . 
  assumptions 'll do pig , assumptions 'll do . 
  if we started convicting for corruption in bulgarian there would n't be enough people eligible for politicians left . 
  maybe because it 's called `` manifesto '' . 
  your comment was offensive i said nothing about being offended . 
  although you comment is really offensive i think it 's actually an honor that you think we ( balkan peoples ) pull the strings in europe on * something . 
  the us army actually inactively protects opium production and mostly trade . 
  do n't forget that most of the people who got the power in the interim government are heavily involved in opium trade . 
  the removal of the taliban prompted a massive increase in opium production . 
  since the occupation it 's reached historical records .

  slave labor is best for business . 
  british women gave really massive femora . 
  i think the catholic church has a patent on this one . 
   i ca n't know who you believe was murdered [ you could ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/13ahmn/marka%c4%8d_and_gotovina_are_freed/c728v8k ) if you were n't trying so hard to straw man my argument . 
  not guilty does n't make them the fucking heroes you 're making them . 
  but you know what ? 
  fuck sanity . 
  do whatever you want . 
  now you have a reason to celebrate . 
   there is no such thing as legal ** murder of civilians ** ( edit knowing one will unintentionally cause some civilian deaths as collateral damage is though ) so basically what you 're saying is `` there 's no such thing ( except when there is ) '' militarily often use civilian devastation for demoralizing or bludgeoning the enemy . 
  and/or ( as is also in this case ) for revenge . 
  in fact it is our civilization 's biggest achievement that we finally started holding militay murderers accountable . 
  this was n't the case before the 1850s . 
  and it 's always the same thing . 
  they just let soldiers loose like wild animals on the civilians and then hide behind the `` no official order '' bullshit . 
  i believe it was only stalin who had the fucking balls to stand behind the atrocities of the army under his command ( talking about the orders to rape as much german women as possible , as revenge for the nazis degradation of the russian race ) . 
  my point however is that you ca n't call someone who this or the other way had civilian death under his command a hero . 
  a * hero * would be someone who did his fucking job which also includes not letting barbaric acts happen . 
  that 's it . 
  full stop . 
  ** and bam ** just like that , you convinced me . 
  first thing tomorrow i 'm going to cease being not religious and convert to catholicism because of all the strong christian forgiveness you appear to harbor in your heart full of care and love for the poor enemy civilians that lost their lives , with all the wisdom and faith in a better peaceful future on the balkans . 
  i thank you . 
  oh we 're religious , alright . 
  in a very balkan way . 
  like if you told me we 're the same religion i will recite a history lesson telling you how superior the * bulgarian * orthodox church is and how your church is probably totally inferior to us because of reasons . 
  i 'm telling you they are not and never will be . 
  sorry i do n't want to celebrate murderers - be them legally or illegally so . 
  it 's revealing of your mentality that you actually care where i 'm from as if fucking righteousness for civilian murder comes with national affiliation . 
  not guilty of those crimes ? 
  probably , it 's been decided . 
  but they are not heroes . 
  not in any stretched sense . 
  spreading the good message of [ butthurt ] ( http://i.imgur.com/73fka.gif ) . 
  nobody ever prays in bulgaria , never . 
  maybe old ladies in churches .
