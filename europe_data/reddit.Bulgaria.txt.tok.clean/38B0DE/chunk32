  it really weirds me out when some other folks close hands and start talking to themselves . 
  i propose a name ** u-bai ** ( union of balkanica , appenninica , and iberica ) . 
  they are in no shape or form heroes . 
  is that a thing in croatia ? 
  do you pray a lot ? 
  romanians , happy to send gypsies to germany since 1942 !, 
  maybe being owned by a failing austrian telekom , bought by a company making super billions with monopoly in poor developing countries will make wonders in that direction . 
  they `` tells it like it is '' in the most instigating one-way approach possible . 
  we 're the perfect excuse to crap on foreigners in germany without being called a nazi . 
  i love it though , at least we 're not in the ignore fog anymore , we now exist . 
  the romani are our frontpage posts . 
  and we have a ton more to show . 
  as soon as i saw this i knew racists are going to spread it around . 
  it is instigating in the exact rhetoric of the antiziganism today in europe . 
  if you check spiegel tv and spiegel as a whole there are only negative articles about bulgaria and romania . 
  the most wretched , depressing , ugly stories you could imagine . 
  80 % of them are about the romas . 
  it 's not all that diarrhea and death here . 
  there are other stories that could be interesting . 
  i do n't understand the fascination with the utter apocalyptic desperation . 
  german authorities are n't ready for this . 
  i understand the logic behind it . 
  i do n't really need all that extended web adress text up there . 
  tab hoarders were definitely not taken into account . 
  but all this has been made irrelevant in the win8 touch environment , though . 
  i played a bit with a win rt tablet . 
  it 's [ completely new ] ( http://youtu.be/nih4jycucf4 ) and much more usable . 
  slow and clunky - yes but not `` incredibly '' . 
  actually only safari loads [ faster ] ( http://youtu.be/sapuxe9dxyo?t=1m14s ) than ie9 . 
  anything accidentally opened is frustrating , especially if you 've never used it . 
  [ disable taskbar grouping ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-z1ap70sp0 ) if you do n't like it . 
  add-ons are overrated . 
  chrome has millions but i really only use two ( one of them i 've used only once ) . 
  i personally love where [ ie is going ] ( http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/1/3057265/internet-explorer-10-windows-8-do-not-track-default/in/3078371 ) and will keep an eye on them . 
  if people in bulgaria 's prisons were dogs it would probably be declared for the cruelest place on earth and you would see millions of people in the west protesting , making documentaries , and liking facebook groups . 
  you would be baffled how many successful companies still have 10 year old xp computers that take 15 minutes to start up . 
  ie6 is n't the problem there . 
  it 's had add-ons and extensions for a long time now . 
  ie is n't all that bad , you 're all over-dramatizing . 
  people still use ie because the standard experience is quite all right . 
  welcome to eastern europe my friend . 
  the name zelko sounds suspiciously serbian ... 
  serbs already made such a movie . 
  you can see the poster in the background . 
  that 's why they met . 
  maybe they have a life . 
  you lack an understanding of what populism is . 
  [ google ] ( http://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;ion=1#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;tbo=u&amp;q=populism&amp;tbs=dfn:1&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=feuzujdzlcnfsgax_id4ca&amp;ved=0cckqkq4&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=75560347d54fa405&amp;bpcl=37189454&amp;biw=1918&amp;bih=995&amp;ion=1 ), 
  the fuck did i just read . 
  i would really love if you could give me an example of `` populist federal europe politics '' . 
  or in which universe is that possible ? 
  attack a country and see how much power the `` normal people '' have . 
  i do n't think it 's because he 's black per se but because after bush the republicans were in such a crisis they went full populist . 
  when you go full populist your opponent is reduced to a hollow figure that could be anything . 
  snap a hitler mustache and call him a communist . 
  you just pull the crazies on the surface and everybody else loses , your opponents included . 
  populism will end only if they get what they want and themselves extinguish the populist fire . 
  i saw a couple of iranian propaganda books last month . 
  those people are literally on the last phase of bloodthirst-insanity . 
  i really hope you will not be as stupid to send your women and men to that fucked up place to be slaughtered . 
  it 's so obvious that republicans have super deep hate for obama . 
  you have the feeling they want to ruin their own country right now so the first black president would n't be a positive figure in history . 
  at least with a white male in they would start doing some positive work again . 
  more a result of populist than actual politics . 
  i have a problem with this comment . 
  the uk does have an active role in the eu . 
  but they refuse the fiscal union exactly because they reject the idea of `` the steering wheel '' , quasi some form of single eu government . 
  it matters to the lgbt people the same way it matters to greeks and macedonians what ethnicity he had . 
  it 's their history they 've been denied . 
  his teacher aristotle praised the great love between men and made a strong connection between intellect and homosexuality . 
  maybe it had to do with women 's social status but never the less it is a fact . 
  alexander lived in a homonormative society . 
  it 'd be really weird if he did n't have male lovers . 
  he was also a raging bisexual but i do n't see a lot of you celebrating this . 
  according to some sociologists like zygmunt bauman it all started when the aristocracy in europe started employing jews for collecting taxes . 
  as non christians their social mobility was very restricted and they posed no thread to their power . 
  jews acquired access to education , culture , and capital . 
  slowly the scapegoat role of the jews began developing as they were directly involved in `` robbing '' the poor subjects . 
  the last nail in the coffin were plagues which the still `` young '' church blamed on the jews to stop a return to polytheism and paganism . 
  we 're talking about russia here - the most multicultural federation to ever exist for so long . 
  the russians are the most `` invasive tribal species '' that flooded most of europe and asia . 
  this is n't fear or defense , this is sadism . 
  that was the weakest attempt at trolling ever . 
  nigger ( \u043d\u0435\u0433\u0440 ) is n't even a derogatory term in russia . 
  and if anyone is wondering why romanians are so intense about this - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_baia_mare_cyanide_spill, 
  antisemitism never disappears . 
  never . 
  half the russian oligarchs are of `` jewish ethnicity '' ( khodorkovsky , abramovich , fridman are the top three richest russians ) and it 's enough to fuel a lot of hate . 
  there has always been strong nordicism and antisemitism in russia . 
  it 's not a coincidence that one of the few russian words in the english language is [ `` pogrom '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pogrom ) . 
  half of canada is catholic so it makes more sense . 
  do ** you ** see the pattern ?!, 
  does n't it seem like macedonia is trying to troll everybody ? 
  you have a long complicated conflict with greece over the name yet you decide to build a gigantic [ fuck you greece ] ( http://www.dw.de/image/0,,16069332_401,00.jpg ) in the middle of your capital . 
  instead of focusing on bullshit history , try some contemporary stuff . . you know like economic cooperation , dialogue , solidarity , liberty , democracy , human rights , european unity . 
   `` bulgaria can not grant an eu certificate to the actions of the government in skopje which is systematically employing an ideology of hate towards bulgaria , '' plevneliev stated . 
  it 's the balkans . 
  we hate a lot of things , mostly our neighbors and even ourselves . 
  hate has become a mainstream culture . 
  but anyways .
