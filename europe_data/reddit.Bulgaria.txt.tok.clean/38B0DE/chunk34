  it 's the language . 
  german sentence structure is at fault here . 
  as well as the extreme word build . 
  it 's much harder to make a good joke set-up in german than english . 
  you need a higher level of language talent to be good at humor in german . 
  it makes everything different . 
  also germans are really weird when it comes to how they react to jokes . 
  i 've tried sitting through german stand up ... fucking audience claps after every other even remotely funny gesture , word , set up and punchline . 
  that is really annoying . 
  they clap a lot and for long . 
  sometimes it 's a great joke but instead of giving in to uncontrollable laughter they ruin it in concentrating on clapping . 
  we should create a european `` almost politically correct redneck '' meme . 
  fun fact . 
  china opted out of this bad idea and even has a one standard time zone adjusted to beijing . 
  that 's 5 geographic time zones into one . 
  for me that makes more sense than not having an universal time zone and still having warsaw and madrid in the same time zone . 
  toilets are a mirror to the soul of a country . 
  more often toilets are disgusting not because of the staff but because people use them like animals . 
  yes , there are some variants but `` belarusian '' is the international standard since 1993 . 
  only if you 're legal . 
  look at it as a penalty . 
  according to his own statements he 's spent 200 million euros on lawyers . 
  ... for feminists !, 
  belarusian *, 
  forgive my ignorance but is there someone who can outline what minorities are in question here ? 
  it 's removed at birth . 
  there should just be `` i do n't know '' option . 
  being as we in the face of the red army completely obliterated the nazis , i do n't think we 're exactly what you would call `` victims '' . 
  we do have our sovereign states , powerful armies , recognized rich culture and a strong place in the world . 
  personally , i think you even suggesting this on this occasion is utterly pathetic . 
  although in the mainstream it is being presented as some kind of pluralism ( submitted it in the context of an attempt to value the diversity among the victims of what is erroneously branded into our transactive memory as `` the holocaust '' ) , looking at reactions now i can confirm that it has a much needed effect . 
  only a good sociologist can try to explain the meaning of memorials but they do possess a lot of weight . 
  i guess it 's never too late to remember ...  `` no second class victims '' well . . just saying it wo n't change how most people feel . 
  as long as we do n't let the issues of the state of the european romani people be swept under the carpet , change will come . 
  that one would be a [ porajmos ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porajmos ) memorial . 
  and that 's a first as far as i know . 
  my bad . 
  i hope the numbers have changed for the better . 
  may i humbly suggest adding a few things ? 
  * if / r/europeans are employed or unemployed ? 
  * what are 3 other subreddits / r/europeans subscribe to ? 
  * is / r/europe representative of europe ? 
  atheism is extremely heterogeneous . 
  there are a lot of ways to approach it . 
  absence of legitimization for traditional faith based doctrines does n't mean you ca n't subscribe to prejudice or xenophobia . 
  in the same time christianity in europe is n't the cause for islamophobia or the other way around . 
  but it is definitely the main intensifier of such ethnic/cultural problems . 
  you are an ideot and you shold troll better . 
  haha dumbass , this is / r/europe not / r/faggetcommunism = = = = t = h = i = s = = =  way gypsy lover gay !, 
  ha ha, 
  as a bulgarian i feel obliged to join this discussion so we can complete the triforce of antiziganist countries !, 
  what 's first on the list guys ? 
  denial ? 
  great !, 
  `` we should truly stop circlejerking about gypsies . 
  it 's stupid because gypsies clearly deserve hate and discrimination . 
  all of them '' did i do well guys ? 
  am i finally white supremacists european ? 
  guys ? 
  why does it take so long to count less than 300k ballots ? 
  you are very humorous , you should do stand up !, 
  your comment is incredibly correct . 
  it 's hard to know racism if you are the mainstream where you live . 
  you never feel racism because nobody is racist against you , so it 's easy to deny it . 
  so brave . 
  it 's not about filming or photography per se . 
  it 's not even about making it legal to break your neck for trying to hold them accountable . 
  it 's about the fact that they ca n't and do not want to control police brutality and this presents them with a huge problem . 
  it starts overshadowing how people legitimize the individual police office and their actual work of . . you know - law enforcement . 
  i do n't think it 's so bad if he 's talking in language most americans , his audience would understand . 
  you have to realize we 're the only one who could ever understand the internal dynamics of the continent and we do n't really fully understand it . 
  * european * union is kind of confusing . 
  i mean . . look at how many europeans do n't understand the uk and just call everybody english ? 
  or how ignorant we ourselves are of the complexity of huge nations like india , china or the us .

  that gif froze my browser for good 20 seconds . 
  all germans are nazis = all greeks are lazy, 
   through the magic of being a foreigner well now . . the * right * kind of foreigner . 
  i did n't say `` east germany was n't a case of free thought and healthy secularism '' . 
  you 're insane , dude . 
  it 's amazing how fast you can get rid of religion if you exclude indoctrination and religious education from an early age . 
  i only said he could be abusive which would lead his intellectually underdeveloped wife to have irrational fears of getting a divorce because of a pregnancy . 
  goddamn pills are harder to swallow than bear a child for 9 months and then murder it ... 
  i can not confirm with absolute certainty that it was in fact her husband that orchestrated the murders . 
  this is truly an issue of gender , as you fine sir have recognized . 
  i bow to you and your superior intellect . 
  forgive me , please . 
  salafism gives everybody the creeps . 
  fear sells . 
  she does say she is afraid of him ditching her if she had more kids . 
  so i assume , and i think rightfully so , that he 's abusive . 
  i refuse to believe he 's a complete angel . 
  from the title of the article  [ ... ] says husband did n't want more kids, 
  thanks for the reply that does n't include stupid cunt . 
  i hear that irony theory pretty often ( it is applied to all kinds of racist apologist rhetoric , and was very popular in the us after the civil war in relation to the migration of the freed black slaves to the north ) and it implies that the people who criticize antiziganism have never been confronted with ** the gypsy ** . 
  the minute those non-discriminating people meet ** the gypsy ** they immediately change their minds because get to know ** the truth ** . 
  so that 's why i wrote the comment . 
  take it anyway you want it but i did n't say precisely you are discriminating . 
  but thanks for the `` i 'm not racist , i have black friends '' type reply . 
  it 's only second to `` i 'm not racist but ^ * insert ^ vile ^ racism ^ here * '' .
