  we are all idioms , man !, 
  i heard he 'll be joining some catalonian separatists before the autumn . 
  he might do better there . 
   number 10 should have had a plan .

  give the man a break !, 
   when the eu tells greece to fuck off and what should they have told them ? 
  `` oh about those billions in debt . . 
  `` sure , declare bankruptcy and bring the whole eu and world financial systems down with you . 
  no biggie . '', 
  and yeah , right - [ giving greece billions in debt aid bailouts ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/greek_government-debt_crisis#/bailout_programmes ) and [ agreeing for relief of some of the current debt ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/business/international/greece-debt-relief-imf-eurozone-bailout.html ) ... 
  i mean , can you believe the nerve of these fuckers from the eu , right ? 
  so what does `` proficiency '' mean here exactly ? 
  percent of the people that speak the language to some extent , or some statistics from english exams taken ? 
  they have oil . 
  you did to yourselves buddy , you should 've never gotten in our antivirus racket business . 
  haha just checked this - http://www.mylifeelsewhere.com/compare/bulgaria/croatia some surprising data , like - how the hell are you guys on 21.6 % unemployment ?? 
  is this because of seasonal/tourist work orientation ? 
  also apparently our health care system sucks ass , but unsurprising for a field that has been consistently underfunded over so many years . 
  and last :  bulgaria ( 354km of coastline )  croatia ( 5,835 km of coastline )  1548.3 % increase in coastline god damn you , dalmatians !, 
  yup , that 's russian only . 
  never seen a squatting guy ever in my life in eastern europe , though plenty in adidas tracksuits . 
  it was/is just some weird status symbol here . 
  to be fair , burgas is actually famous in bulgaria for a lot of people in adidas tracksuits . 
  honestly !, 
  in the rest if the country i guess it just varies . 
  there used to be times when owning an original adidas/nike was the capitalist dream or sth , people were poor . 
  but now that the gdp per capita is higher that 's passed off for most people . 
  and have in mind his press secretary spicer and kellyanne conway have been spewing bullshit in industrial quantities , trying to spin and divert attention as much as they can from what he actually says and writes on twitter . 
  well , shame on you , whoever did bulgaria and put varna ( a port ) as a land-locked city and sofia ( land-locked capital ) as a sea port . 
  not funny . 
  they love to stir shit up , but some of them do n't mind taking some money on the side , and stir it at the exact moment that politicians need them - to agitate the police and break up the protest when it 's grown bigger and is hard to ignore anymore . 
  if the country ( steered by the ruling class ) shits on your life and your rights every day , you start to give shit about the country alright . 
  you can be apathetic if it was one single issue , or two , or three , but when corruption and system decay get in the way of you achieving or hoping for any future good quality of life - yeah you 'd be `` i 'm as mad as hell and i 'm not going to take it anymore !!! '', 
  all the time . 
  at least in my country they sometimes get paid to show up at protests and provoke violence , no matter on whose side - ruling politicians , or the public 's . 
  it 's a win-win situation for the ultras - they want to fight cops , and get paid for it . 
  and the political party in power then point fingers at the protest as a whole and get to shout things like `` all of the people here are paid protesters , and violent numbnuts , these are not a peaceful protesters or representing the public in general , so we can repress these protests '' ... : /,

  ah the kukeri - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukeri , no wonder you have something similar , though as i know every region comes up with their own type of crazy suit . 
  it was built by an ancient race of communist dwarves to keep a close watch over the land . 
  no surprise . 
  this motherfucker kept our bulgarian medics as scapegoats ** for 8 years ** wrongfully imprisoned , tortured and with death sentences hanging over their heads . 
  they falsely accused them of deliberately infecting 400 children with hiv , when it was clear even from the beginning from international reports that it was result of `` poor hygiene and reuse of syringes , and that the infections began before the arrival of the nurses and doctor in 1998 '' . 
  https://www.wikiwand.com/en/hiv_trial_in_libya#/scientific_studies_and_reports and gaddafi even had the gall to use them as hostages and demand ransom from western powers , which he bellowed were behind some hiv-infection conspiracy against lybia . 
  not sorry one bit that this pathetic asshole is dead and buried , whatever the situation is now with the arab spring aftermath . 
  then again his approval ratings are only going up since the ukraine conflict , so at least seems he knows his audience well .

  and corruption !, 
  i know , but they 're not popular enough . 
  that 's why i think a more centralized source would be heard louder , but i also understand why they would n't want to do that - freedom of the press and etc. 
  still , some more official and centralized press office should help the eu with the mass desinformation that 's employed by many far right and anti-eu groups . 
  they really should put more funds into their pr , they 're really not doing that great job at mass-informing what they have achieved and what are their strong points . 
  we need a european news network and some eu newspaper/news website , in the vein of bbc and dw . 
  russia saw that 's what they need to get ( dis ) information en masse to people , and now they have rt. 
  eu really needs its own popular news network to have its viewpoints heard more clearly .

  obama 2019 : hope for greece, 
  they were just [ messaging ] ( http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html ) till now . 
  seems to be a pretty new modification . 
  it was a roll , alright . 
   he might have said a thing or two to appease pro-russia sentiments just saying he 's still a bit of an unknown , so i 'm giving him some credit of doubt . 
  personally - have n't voted for him , but i hope for the good of the country that with such background he 'll turn up to be more moral and balanced guy . 
  and not just a communist puppet . 
  he 's not exactly pro-putin , he might have said a thing or two to appease pro-russia sentiments , but he did not say anything anti-eu or nato and seems like a much more `` balance '' guy himself - he 's actually an air-force guy who 's finished his officer and military college degrees in the us . 
  so we 'll see for sure when he 's in office what exactly he 's pro- about . 
  i can only speak for bulgaria - this means nothing . 
  first , in bulgaria the current government is pro-eu , they may have just resigned , but are going to elections with still the strongest support for a pro-eu path , so next government is highly likely to be this way again . 
  even their socialist opponents are pretty much pro-eu though they like 'em some russia too . 
  also current president is strongly pro-eu and if it comes to appointing transitional government till the elections - it will be pro-eu also . 
  as for our new president-elect on the map - he 's a socialist-backed one that is not a political figure , and got elected only because the other ( centrist ? ), 
  candidate with serious support did not look suited for president at all . 
  also the president 's position in bulgaria is more of a moral compass and only has limited veto power ( anything vetoed goes back to parliament and can be voted again , this time without option to veto ) so as long as there 's a government he has n't much power . 
  ** tl ; dr : ** we ai n't dead or red yet . 
  ah coolers - the thing that keeps you and your things from melting . 
  hmm , you 've got a good point actually . 
  but come to think about it - then they named it on the guy that fucked up , not the one that actually made the wings and used them properly - daedalus . 
  according to the [ wikipedia page ] ( https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ikarus_bus ) :  it was established in 1895 as uhri imre kov\u00e1cs - \u00e9s kocsigy\u00e1rt\u00f3 \u00dczeme ( roughly : `` imre uhri 's blacksmith workshop and coach factory '' ) . 
   ...  on 23 february 1949 , ikarus was officially established ** when it merged with airplane manufacturer ikarus g\u00e9p \u00e9s f\u00e9mgy\u00e1r rt. 
  ** & nbsp ; so in the beginning there was a * motherfucking * ** airplane manufacturer ** named after icarus ... 
  i get the idea - myth of first flight and all that , but does n't inspire much confidence in their airplanes , does it ? 
  also , there are plenty of alcoves in bruges . 
  nice grim fandango reference there , / u/lostsoulsalliance !, 
  ( if that 's that ), 
  colluding during elections with the russians , and multiple of his people , including trump , lying to officials , and public , that nobody from his campaign had done that or even met with the ruskies - that 's quite the impeachable offense . 
  he may be doing much more damage in ( all ) other areas , but this is the one clear illegal thread that can be acted upon , so investigative agencies and press are concentrating on that . 
  do n't worry , it only eats those that do n't pay their debts ... 
   r/evilbuildings i do n't know , look pretty damn nice and modernistic to me . 
  yeah , those top curves maybe give it a bit `` frowny '' vibe , but also save it from looking too bland , and overall it has a nice open , `` breathing '' feel .
