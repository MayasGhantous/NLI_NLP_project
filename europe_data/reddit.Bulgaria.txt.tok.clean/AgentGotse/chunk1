this is an excellent way to end up on a nsa watchlist . 
  4 in my hand luggage . 
  sometimes more in hold luggage if i am moving stuff around . 
  i do n't even know how many i have in my room in the uk . 
  and now i have several in my apartment in bulgaria for electronics that i have bought in the uk and given to my family here . 
  the article explains pretty well that the land mass in question is not actually an island , but they decided to put it in the headline anyway . 
  also , ** some ** words are ** bolded ** , because fuck ** it ** , why ** not ** ? 
  fuck this website . 
  1 per device , country dependent . 
  pfft , that 's nothing . 
  in bulgaria , the same company has won the contract for government it support in the past ** 18 years ** . 
  they choose microsoft every time . 
  how about we also standardise on wall sockets ? 
  i travel between the uk and bulgaria all the time and it is mildly annoying to carry all of the converters . 
  in the second picture , the vertical scale should read `` percent of gdp '' not `` millions $ '' . 
  your link shows 4 companies based in these countries which are involved in south stream . 
  that does n't mean the governments endorse it . 
  plus , no matter how you look at it , the eu and the interests of some of the members states are opposite . 
  several member states signed up for constructing it , but the eu opposes it . 
  pretty simple . 
  the people who sold out bulgaria to russian interests were the bulgarian socialist party and their ilk in the triple coalition with notable help from our glorious socialist ex-president georgi parvanov ( better known under his communist cunt nickname agent gotse ) . 
  they are the ones who signed the contract under dubious terms and highly dubious advantages for our country . 
  bulgaria and romania have been the black sheep of the eu ever since we joined . 
  member states had zero obligation to impose work restrictions on us for the first 6 years after we joined , but many still they decided to do it . 
  they were dropped in 2014 , rather reluctantly , because there were contractual obligations to do so . 
  this issue is basically digging into the same stuff , so it should be pretty obvious why member states who were imposing work restrictions on us would be pissed off . 
  also , i personally do not see an `` us '' in the eu , many member states who have the balls are looking after their own interests first . 
  example -- austria . 
  we got our asses handed to us for south stream , the european commision was threating sanctions and whatnot , then the austrians signed the contract with gazprom to build it , even after the ukranian crisis and the so-called consensus ( at the time ) to impose serious sanctions ( which did n't happen before they destoyed the airplane ) . 
  ok , that 's cool , but both of these have almost zero relevance for other member states . 
  if we are to block this one , then will piss off everybody else . 
  i do n't know about you guys , but i am completely sure that the bulgarian government will do as it is told by the big boys in the eu . 
  i can not think of a single issue where the bulgarian government has held its ground and not bend to eu interests . 
  the united states congress two weeks ago agreed that the us will start delivering weapons to them . 
  their numbers will start to swell up . 
  you ignored the part where i said that your government has been supporting the free syrian army , which is fighting againt the syrian government . 
  your government has been delivering non-lethal and non-humanitarian aid to them for years . 
  i do n't know what you mean by `` we '' but the uk is certainly not supporting the syrian state . 
  last year the uk parlimanet was debating whether they should bomb the syrian government forces and the uk government is still maintaining that the syrian government is not an ally in this campaign . 
  the uk is not supporting syrian government forces , but the free syrian army which is a rebel group fighting against the syrian government . 
  i am yet to see you contributing anything to any discussion around here other than commenting on what other people are saying , usually in extreme generalisations . 
  that guy is not very much liked in macedonia these days . 
  he is considered by many as a national traitor and he caused a lot of butthurt after he applied and got bulgarian citizenship . 
  there was also a tv report on bulgarian tv about all the historical bs in macedonia and he was interviewed there as well , saying a lot of the same stuff again . 
  [ video is here ] ( http://www.btv.bg/video/shows/btv-reporterite/videos/btv-reporterite-makedoniya.html ) but i am too lazy to translate . 
  still , you can skip through to see all of the monuments they have built recently , it 's ridicolous . 
  on a serious note , government propaganda is a serious bitch . 
  all of this alexander the great and other history bs was pushed for a long time during yugoslav times and amazingly it still continues today . 
  it seems absolutely ridicolous to many of us , but imagine living there with little access to outside information ( not everybody has internet access or the desire to look into topics which you take for granted ) . 
  ** a lot ** of time and money is wasted on this nonsense ( check out the recent historical revamp of skopie center ) instead of tackling actual problems . 
  and macedonia is a pretty poor country . 
  the bulgarian ethnicity is a mix of three others -- the bulgars who came in the balkans around the 7th centry , slavs and thracians who were already there . 
  it 's believed the slavs were the majority , hence why bulgarian is a slavic language . 
  the bulgars were the ruling class in the beginning and gave the name to the counry . 
  the picture somehow exploded on the internet and that 's why some media reported on it in the back of the news emission in the entertainment section . 
  i watched a report from one of the tv stations and i thought one of her colleagues was even hotter than her . 
  the first day of school in bulgaria is a big thing , kids are all happy and shit , put nice clothes on , parents and relatives go with them to the school and take pictures etc. 
  it 's all very festive and there 's no studying . 
  it 's not like this is some major news or anything . 
  this is just filler material in the back of the news . 
  and it 's only there because it somehow got popular on the internet . 
  bulgarian and macedonian are mutually intelligble languages ( linguistic fact ) . 
  now , if you go over in macedonia and suggest that their language is a bulgarian dialect , then you will cause a lot of buthurt and you could get in trouble . 
  if you say the same in bulgaria , then people will agree with you and nobody will care much about it . 
  basically , what is a dialect and what is a language is getting very much in politics territory and people can get buthurt over that . 
  that position was reversed . 
  many jimmies were rustled and the temporary government withdrew the report . 
  only goes to show how strong russian influence still is . 
  it only took a day . 
  still , it 's was nice to hear that the president of the country agrees with it regardless . 
  i 've never heard of any of those conspiracy theories . 
  i was there when i was a 11 year old boy ( so 15 years ago ) . 
  spent a week in kishinev where i was participating in a eastern european international folkore competition ( this actually happened , i am not making shit up ) . 
  i was there with my classmates who were all in a school folklore troupe . 
  we also went to that region as well because there are a lot of people from bulgarian decent . 
  my memories are pretty vague but it was bizarre -- i remember there were some people wearing traditional bulgarian nosii ( old style folklore colthes ) . 
  definetely remember several old men wearing poturi ( old style folklore trousers ) . 
  it was like the place was stuck in time , really bizarre . 
  it felt like i was in 1830s bulgaria . 
  maybe they were expecting us or something , i do n't know . 
  not much help , but i do n't have any other memories than this . 
  also , as a friendly advice , beware of extreme corruption . 
  it 's much worse compared to bulgaria , which is saying something . 
  like , holy shit , our bus was loaded with two cases of whiskey because everybody knew you would have to bribe many border guards and local police so that they would leave you alone . 
  it was gone before we arrived in kishinev . 
  ( part of it was lost in romania though ), 
  all of ukip 's constituents are racist now ? 
  a bit quick on the generalisations here . 
  also , this does n't have anything to do with race . 
  there are some converts among the british isis fighters as well . 
  what farage is saying is dumb in my opinion , but there 's no need to use dirty arguing tactics by labeling people you do n't like as racists . 
  looks like it 's time for some sanctions against the us technology sector over this and general nsa bullshit . 
  but do n't hold your breath , the eu is pretty worthless on this . 
  you are very wrong . 
  look up the whole `` united macedonia '' bs that their government and many citizens are spouting . 
  there are youtube videos where you can see maps of greater macedonia inside classrooms . 
  i have many macedonian friends and a good deal of them have spoken to me about that , one guy even shamelessly has greater macedonia as his cover photo on facebook . 
  people really do believe that shit over there and it is because of long-term government propaganda . 
  this is , of course , done through no small part of bullshitting heavily about history at the expense of greek ( primarily ) and bulgarian ( to a lesser extent ) culture . 
   - anyway i think it 's deeper than that , but imma let greeks talk from now on as i 've been accused of being a straw man , whatever that might be fucking lol .
