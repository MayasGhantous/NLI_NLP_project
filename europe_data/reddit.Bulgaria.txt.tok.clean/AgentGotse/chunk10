  a romanian friend of mine who is openly pro-animal-bla-bla discussed the matter by saying that there is no conclusive evidence that the child was killed by stray dogs , that she personally believes this is media manipulation and most importantly , even if true , ** she `` feels more sorry for a dog than a human '' ** . 
  it 's exactly these kinds of people that prevent the problem from being solved in sofia as well . 
  also , sterilisation is hard to do right , is more expensive and in sofia at least , the people who are doing it are corrupt . 
  here 's what i wrote on the matter some time ago : another problem with sterilisation is that it is super expensive to check it is done correctly . 
  in my country , it was revealed that after a dog is `` sterilized '' then they just put on it some kind of collar and that 's it -- there 's no information who actually carried out the `` sterilization '' on the collar . 
  turns out , some of the fuckers who were responsible for doing it , figured out that since the dog can never be traced back to them , they can just release it unsterlized back in the city with a pointless collar , while getting paid of course . 
  talk about a fucking racket -- they can just pick up dogs and get paid for doing nothing and then do the same thing over and over again with the same dogs and the newborn pups . 
  i 'm not sure if this has been fixed yet . 
  but you get the idea , other than paying for the whole medical procedure , then you need inspectors to go over the city and check if the dogs are castrated . 
  also , i 'd much rather have all the dogs in the city euthanised , because it would be way cheaper . 
  the money required to keep them alive and sterlized can be used for much more needed social programs . 
  it 's built with russian technology and relies on russian nuclear fuel, 
  erm , bulgaria is still russia 's bitch . 
  most of our energy sector is dependent on russian imports . 
  the dirty fucking communists who are currently in power also want to make our dependence on russia even higher by building a new nuclear power plant . 
  while what you mention is a good intention in my opinion as well , it has not really worked at all . 
  sorry buddy , mars is historically macedonian land . 
  there are a handful of countries offering asylum . 
  which country would you suggest ? 
  the only other countries that did so are in latin america . 
  a destination which is currently pretty hard to reach , given the fiasco with the bolivian president 's jet . 
  what exactly is this advantage that snowden has provided to foreign intelligence agencies ? 
  well , i am student in the uk and i ca n't wait to go back in december !, 
  i do n't know why linking entry into schengen is linked with the freedom of movement of gypsies in the first place . 
  ** everybody ** from bulgaria and romania ** can already ** freely travel into the schengen area anyway . 
  you just need to present an id or passport at the border control and that 's it . 
  i 've done it many times , that 's all that 's required . 
  the border folks can not refuse you entry unless they have some pretty good reason ( i 've never actually seen somebody refuse entry ) . 
  denying entry into schengen will accomplish exactly jack shit about the freedom of movement of citizens . 
  it also will not accomplish anything on the front of bulgarians and romanians getting access to the labour market . 
  after 2014 , all restrictions on that are removed , regardless of whether we go into schengen or not . 
  i do n't even know why this bs is brought up all the time . 
  the only way to prevent the movement of people is to either kick out bulgaria and romania from the eu or the host country itself leave the eu . 
  there was also even a deal struck between the french and romanian government to more effectively streamline the process of deporting gypsies who are there illegally . 
  http://www.errc.org/article/new-deal-between-france-and-romania-on-roma-returns-must-not-breach-rights-to-free-movement/4053 since then , the number of people deported back to bulgaria and romania has increased compared to the previous government . 
  what can i say , massive hypocrisy . 
  it 's pretty simple i think -- egoism . 
  the guy just looks after himself and does n't give a fuck about italy obviously . 
  needless to say , he 's a massive cunt . 
  you should have linked this instead of the politico article which just talks about mobile . 
  mobile devices are basically a synonym for handhelds which a tablet certainly is . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mobile_device now the complaint that you have quoted is again baseless . 
  these apps are in no way must have . 
  similar functionality can be delivered by other app stores and other apps and services . 
  and this complaint , again , credits android with something it is not responsible for . 
  even if manufacturers choose to go for google play and the rest of google 's crap , consumers can still install additional app stores , apps and services , something which is impossible on other platforms , so the choice is not really limited . 
   so it 's either with google play and other google 's services , or no default google 's services only without google play ? 
  compared with the default install on a nexus 4 it contains far less google crap and also has an additional app store enabled by default . 
  that 's what i meant . 
  if the complaint was merely about the fact that google is offering all of their online services in one big ball of online services , then fair enough -- that 's not something i actually really care about . 
  but that is not the case , they are most definitely trying to paint vanilla android and open source as the main factor responsible for the current situation . 
  note the statements that they make about android and open source in particular that are seriously pissing me off :  google is using its android mobile operating system as a ` trojan horse ' to deceive partners , monopolize the mobile marketplace , and control consumer data there you have it -- android is a trojan horse . 
  you can apparently monopolize the market with android , even though phone manufacturers are distributing forks and anybody can install roms on the phones . 
   google achieved its dominance in the smartphone operating system market by giving android to device-makers for ` free . ' note the quotation marks -- android is not really freely available and there are some nasty strings attached ( blatantly false ) . 
   but in reality , android phone makers who want to include must-have google apps such as maps , youtube or play are required to pre-load an entire suite of google mobile services and to give them prominent default placement on the phone , the complaint says . 
  said nasty strings are that you absolutely must use some of google 's online crap ( blatantly false statement ) and because of lincensing , then you get the whole big-ball-of-google-services . 
   google 's predatory distribution of android at below-cost makes it difficult for other providers of operating systems to recoup investments in competing with google 's dominant mobile platform , the complaint says . 
  hurr durr , fuck open source and protect my lets-sell-some-proprietary-software business model that is not working for me . 
  apparently the fact that they too ( they = microsoft , because nobody else cares about the operating system ) can release an open-source os in completely unacceptable . 
  the fact that the coalition can make their own app store and offer all of their online services on android ( and thereby competing with google 's big ball of services ) is completely unthinkable as well -- that would require more money that just bitching at the eu for legal action . 
   please remember that the complaint is not about the availability of android or about gpl or open source or free software per se . 
  it 's about google 's behaviour in the eu market regarding the exclusive agreements with smartphone manufacturers when bundling google 's services in smartphones . 
  i have read the article you linked and that is not true . 
  they are compalining about android and mobile in particular . 
  here :  google used its `` desktop search dominance '' to fund and give away its ** android operating system for free ** and has since taken over the market for licensable mobile operating systems . 
  also  google imposes `` de facto '' anti-competitive exclusive agreements on android handset makers . 
  ( this is of course complete bullshit as i explained in my other post , android is freely available and you do not need permission from google to use it in any way ) also  google is leveraging its positions in desktop search and mobile os by ** bundling its mobile search with android ** `` to exclude competition in search on mobile platforms . ''  google ** is bundling its own mobile services in android ** through free preloaded apps `` in order to foreclose competing apps and service providers . '' it is all about bundling , which android does not have . 
  manfucaturers themselves choose to bundle it with google 's crap . 
  how is google responsible for what manufacturers choose to do ? 
  they can certainly ship aosp + fdroid instead ( or any other number of app stores ) , but nobody is doing it ( google play just provides a better service ) . 
   the complaint is about googles conduct in the smartphone market not tablets no it 's about mobile as the quoted parts show . 
  mobile does include tablet , so the example is perfectly relevant . 
   demonstrating that android smartphones on the eu market actually do give the consumer the choice of whether to use google 's services or someone else 's by default would be more relevant . 
  samsung is offering their own app store as well on their phones and not all google services are available by default . 
  nobody is stopping manufacturers from releasing android and bundling it with their own services , exactly like amazon , or with some other services ( you can preload it with bing , bing maps and all that ) . 
  windows phone and ios, 
   the fairsearch coalition argues that google is using its de facto monopoly position in one market ( desktop search and ads ) as a leverage to squelch competition in another market ( smartphones ) by bundling . 
  according to the complaint google is using licensing to bundle its other products and services by requiring smartphone makers to use google 's services ( maps , youtube , search etc ) and have google 's app store as the default . 
  this is not the case . 
  android is freely available and anybody can use it as they please ( before they get threatened with lawsuits from microsoft for patent infringement that is ) . 
  their proprietary apps and play store services are not freely available and are certainly not bundled with android . 
  the phone manufacturers and android distributors have to approach google and strike a deal with them if ** they choose ** to use their proprietary crap . 
  the existence of the kindle fire , which is running android and contains zero google services is a nice example . 
  note that windows phone is worse in this regard , because it is bundled with all of microsoft 's online crap . 
  also , no parallels can be drawn to the windows + internet explorer case -- the latter was also bundled with the operating system . 
  what are these functions that are shifting ? 
  i do n't know of anything like this . 
  this is a laughable complaint on behalf of microsoft . 
  the motivations here should be obvious to anybody -- microsoft wants to use legislation in order to boost their non-working business model in the mobile space -- selling proprietary operating systems . 
  if this works as microsoft intends , this will set a very dangerous precedent in the eu -- that foss ( free and open source software ) is anti-competitive . 
  this , of course , makes exactly zero sense , because as the article explains foss actually ** promotes ** innovation and competition . 
  case in point -- just look at all the new mobile operating systems . 
  all of them are based on and using foss . 
  not to mention the numerous android forks that already exist . 
  also , please do not make the incorrect assumption that android has anything to do with google 's online services . 
  that is provided by optional and proprietary packages that manufacturers can choose to go for , and indeed , there are android distributors that do not bundle any google shit with their android distributions or forks . 
  except that android has no link to any google services . 
  you are probably confusing the * optional * gapps package which is proprietary and not part of aosp . 
  look at the kindle fire for example -- it is running android and has absolutely no google shit around and is even running amazon 's own app store . 
  the android source code is free and open source .
