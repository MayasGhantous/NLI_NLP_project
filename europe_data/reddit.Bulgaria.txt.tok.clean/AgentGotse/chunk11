  if google goes full retard and makes android proprietary , this can only be done to future versions . 
  they can not retroactively change the license of already released versions . 
  numerous android forks ** already ** exist in the forms of roms ( cyanogenmod , replicant , paranoid android , and a plethora of other roms ) and manufacturer forks ( e.g. 
  samsung , htc and many others ) . 
  not to mention , that even right now cyanogenmod got several millions and established a company to do future development . 
  point is , there is absolutely no danger of predatory pricing -- the code can always be forked ( and is right now ) and modifications done . 
  nothing is stopping even microsoft from rolling their own android distribution and bundling it with all of their online services ( which is exactly what amazon are doing with the kindle fire ) . 
  the license also allows them to make their fork of android proprietary , so that they do n't have to share their modifications with anybody unless they wish so ( excluding the linux kernel which is licensed under gplv2 which requires this ) . 
  what 's written on the flags ? 
  another problem with sterilisation is that it is super expensive to check it is done correctly . 
  in my country , it was revealed that after a dog is `` sterilized '' then they just put on it some kind of collar and that 's it -- there 's no information who actually carried out the `` sterilization '' on the collar . 
  turns out , some of the fuckers who were responsible for doing it , figured out that since the dog can never be traced back to them , they can just realise it unsterlized back in the city with a pointless collar , while getting paid of course . 
  talk about a fucking racket -- they can just pick up dogs and get paid for doing nothing and then do the same thing over and over again with the same dogs and the newborn pups . 
  i 'm not sure if this has been fixed yet . 
  but you get the idea , other than paying for the whole medical procedure , then you need inspectors to go over the city and check if the dogs are castrated . 
  also , i 'd much rather have all the dogs in the city euthanised , because it would be way cheaper . 
  the money required to keep them alive and sterlized can be used for much more needed social programs . 
  do n't even bother watching the video , it 's a waste of time . 
  it 's just a handful of dudes getting mad and then arrested by the police . 
  also , vertical . 
  * during my bachelor studies i met a lot of macedonian students , even had a macedonian roommate . 
  good times all around . 
  * went to ohrid once , was pretty good . 
  and also somewhere east of that ( i think naum ) , it was a monastery with a lot of peacocks . 
  that was really nice . 
  drank some nice rakia . 
  good times all around . 
  * language is mutually intelligable with bulgarian , so no trouble communicating between us * they bullshit a lot about history * recently went full retard with a massive lets-build-some-ancient-monuments-project . 
  * many bulgarians consider the language to be a dialect of bulgarian and their whole national identity a result of yugoslav propaganda * one of their prime ministers got a bulgarian citizenship which caused massive amounts of anal devastation in the country ( i am guessing because of above reason ) * bulgaria was the first country to recognise their independence under the current name * plenty of jokes about macedonians in my country * every now and then something insanely stupid happens over there that amuses the entire balkan region -- check out [ this ( supposed decendents of the ancient macedonians from fucking pakistan come to tour the country , jump to 4:20 ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go4u_oujvte ) , note the hoplites . 
  there was also [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iagwr-a8u84 ) which is some kind of national prayer that was broadcasted on national tv for some time ( jump to 4:23 when god is talking -- super racist and delusional shit , i can confirm the subtitles are accurate ) * sizeable albanian minority * a macedonian dude was voted the winner in the latest big brother in bulgaria, 
  terror attacks generally do n't make such sense . 
  i do n't think in absentia trials are common , this is the first time i hear about such a trial in my country . 
  i think they might resort to this because they ca n't find the suspects , i think they 've been wanted for several months now and nobody can locate them ( i pressume foreign intelligence agencies have no idea where they are , because these agencies have assisted with the investigation before ) . 
  they want to pass laws that will allow internet providers to prioritise certain kinds of content over others . 
  example : do you want to download some video from a site that nobody has ever heard of before , [ like this one for example ] ( https://gnunet.org/tor2013tum-video ) ? 
  that 's ok , you can download it with shit speed . 
  do you want to watch some drm-infested crap from big-ass-premium-service-provider inc. ? 
  sure thing , enjoy the highest possible download speed known to man . 
   i assume most of us are ok with prioritising voice over ip and internet tv , but we 're probably against prioritising one website over another or any comperable services over each other because this would be an anticompetitive practice and therefore bad for us consumers that is actually highly debatable and i disagree , primarily because it is impossible to priorities voip while being voip-provider agnostic and secure at the same time . 
  take for example mumble -- it is popular voip technology . 
  it just uses ssl to establish a secure , encrypted connection to a server . 
  it will be hard if not impossible to distinguish mumble traffic from other kinds of ssl traffic . 
  even if you were to somehow magically figure out a solution , after some time , somebody else will make a new voip program that is secure , encrypted and all that , how can you possibly identify it as voip if you have never heard about it before ? 
  it just ca n't be done . 
  they will be slower compared to youtube ( tm ) superpremium + . 
  this will be a european wide acknowledgement that discrimination based on content is ok, 
  here 's what europol had to say on the matter back in february : https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/europol-supports-investigation-terrorist-attack-burgas-airport-bulgaria they assisted with the investigation and agree with the investigators on their findings and possible link to hezbollah . 
  yes , essentially she is saying that no content will be throthled , but in reality some content will be faster than others -- obviously no difference , but that 's how she is phrasing it . 
  this is clearly against the principles of net neutrality where discrimination based on content is not allowed . 
  no , you should read the articles . 
  the proposals are to pay differently depending on content . 
  i can see that ms kroes has mastered the art of deception very well . 
  all of the submissions and titles of articles that i have seen on the matter focus on the roaming charges . 
  the bad news is of course that she wants to kill net neutrality . 
  to make matters even worse , this article gives the ** incorrect ** impression that this legislation will protect net neutrality :  laws to protect net netrality will still allow companies to provide services with assured quality levels , such as video on demand or business-critical cloud applications , so long as they do n't interfere with the speeds promised to customers . 
  customers would also have the righ to check they are receiving the speeds they have paid for and cancel the contract if they are not met . 
  when in reality , this is the complete opposite of what is happening . 
  first of all , here is what net neutrality means ( from wikipedia )  net neutrality ( also network neutrality or internet neutrality ) is the principle that internet service providers and governments ** should treat all data on the internet equally , not discriminating or charging differentially by user , content , site , platform , application , type of attached equipment , and modes of communication ** . 
  here 's what ms. kroes has to say in one of the linked articles :  the reforms will also seek to ** `` guarantee '' net neutrality ** by preventing operators from blocking or throttling competing services , while ** allowing them to offer `` higher '' or `` guaranteed '' speed services ** according to user needs -- a move that seems to be in-line with kroes ' comments earlier this year supporting the right of operators to sell a `` basic package for a lower cost '' but not discriminating against services . 
  http://www.zdnet.com/europe-unwraps-single-market-telecoms-package-offers-operators-a-roaming-law-dodge-7000020471/ talk about fucking doublespeak . 
  net neutrality is not guaranteed in any way -- this is exactly the opposite of net neutrality . 
  also , read this whole article : http://www.zdnet.com/net-neutrality-let-the-market-decide-says-europes-digital-chief-7000009955/ from the horses mouth :  telecoms providers should be able to impose restrictions on internet traffic they deliver over their neworks , kroes wrote in an article for the french newspaper lib\u00e9ration . 
  she clearly wants to kill net neutrality , but notice how she never actually says that in the article -- instead she paints net neutrality as an attack by the government on the free market ( regulating isps to do things ) and as limiting choice to consumers . 
  all of this is of course conveniently bundled with an amazingly popular proposal ( remove roaming charges ) in order to limit opposition to the legislation . 
  fuck you ms. kroes . 
  if we want to get actual debate on net neutrality then it needs to be presented on its own , not like this , and preferably without all of the doublespeak . 
  edit : also , relevant from here : http://euobserver.com/economic/121397  for his part , jeremie zimmermann from la quadrature du net , a french ngo promoting internet freedom , called kroes ' bluff on net neutrality . 
   `` allowing prioritisation of traffic voids any net neutrality provision which bans throttling or blocking of communications , as in practice these deals for discriminating communications , only accessible to massive actors such as google , will amount to de-prioritising everything else , '' zimmermann told this website . 
  thank you . 
  do you know of any polls about these elections in the uk ? 
  i will be in the uk when the voting takes place and i will vote either pirate or green ( do n't even know what options there are ) . 
  on what basis are seats allocated ? 
  yeah , fuck everything about this . 
  i have to say , that 's a clever way to push this anti-net neutrality stuff though . 
  it would clearly fail on its own , so they bundle it up with something insanely popular so that the retards in the european parliament will immidiately vote it in . 
  i 'd much rather pay the roaming charges than to settle for this bs ( and i travel around europe fairly often ) . 
   highest home ownership rate in the world i think that 's because of the way of life during the totalitarian regime . 
   bulgar tribes , thracians and greco-roman people . 
  bulgar , thracians and slavs , the latter thought to have been the majority . 
  gas gun filled with blank bullets . 
  does n't stop the prosecutors from charging the guy with an assassination attempt though . 
  no charges for the fuckers that almost beat him to death and continued to beat him for minutes after he was subdued . 
   terrorists blew up a bus with israeli tourists at the burgas airport last summer , killed something like 30 people 6 people died . 
  5 israeli citizens and the bulgarian bus driver . 
  bulgarian and interpol investigators say there 's evidence that hezbollah was behind it , but it 's not conclusive as far as i remember . 
  maybe you should link to those studies . 
  serbians and bulgarians look very much alike to me at least . 
  the general consensus has been that bulgaria is a slavic country for a long time now as far as i know ( and quick trips to wikipedia confirm that ) . 
  also , it is believed that slavs greatly outnumbered the bulgars and the thracians and hence why the country adopted a slavic language and not the other languages . 
  edit : on wikipedia , i found this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_slavs#genetics and it seems to me that there are n't any big genetical differences reported for bulgarians . 
  do you know if they will provide hosting for the service ? 
  now we know that new copies have been created and shared with the new york times . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/23/guardian-news-york-times-partnership so , the security has actually decreased even according to nick clegg 's logic . 
  the data you are providing is pretty old . 
  in reality , the limux transition has saved money for munich . 
  in fact , microsoft and hp were so desperate in providing them wrong , that they released a [ horribly flawed survey ] ( http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/microsoft-partly-releases-study-on-munich-s-linux-migration-1792733.html ) filled with terrible assumptions . 
  the survey was vastly ridiculed [ including by the limux folks as well ] ( http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/linuxtag-limux-firmly-established-in-munich-1867920.html ), 
  yeah , also , it 's kind of hard to point a laser in a basement unless you are inside it . 
  in that case you might just access/copy hard drive/steal the laptop . 
  it will reduce until the guardian decides to create another copy somewhere else , which they have probably already did .
