  nobody in parliament knew about this . 
  no courts knew about this . 
  the only oversight here is internal reports within gchq who are , of course , completely secret and not a word in them is revealed to anybody outside of gchq . 
  that 's some top-notch accountability right there . 
  that 's even worse than the `` accountability '' of the nsa , who at least pretend to report to a secret court - fisa . 
  [ this post is shit , the one he links in the bottom is much better ] ( https://medium.com/better-humans/d289c6e1392 ), 
  many of the protesters want the government to resign , a new and reformed election codex ( or law ) and then new elections . 
  a big problem for many of the people who are protesting is that there were several parties who did not manage to enter parliament because they went below the entering threshold of 4 % . 
  [ results are here , sorted by voting percent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_parliamentary_election,_2013#results ) . 
  basically , only 4 parties entered parliament who have attracted only 75 % of the votes . 
  so , one of the major demands is to lower the treshold for entry . 
  of course , this parliament would never vote for such a thing , so the only solution that i can see is that they resign and then a new `` great parliament '' ( do n't know how to translate it better ) is formed which would then vote on constitutional changes , new laws etc. 
   do the 2nd and 3rd parties have a majority in the parliament ? 
  they have exactly half of all seats . 
  they managed to form a government because the last party ( the nationalists ) supported them . 
   was it clear before the election that they were likely to partner up with each other ? 
  clear as day . 
   if that is the case , then they did win . 
  i agree completely . 
  this government is still fucking terrible though . 
  i 've never hated any other government as much as this one . 
  these are also the biggest protests that i have seen in my lifetime . 
  why is the police using real bullets ? 
  is there any other source for this other than the linked pictures ? 
  is that guy for real or is he joking ? 
  i seriously ca n't tell . 
  i do n't know about that , but a strong liver is required . 
  give the `` treestyle tab '' addon a try then . 
  it 's very good when you have tons of tabs open . 
   why is it so hard for peopel to understand that you can condemn muslim-extremists , while still not hating muslims on a whole ? 
  because , apparently , you would n't want to be accused of racism . 
  the logic behind how critising someone 's religious beliefs is apparently racist is beyond me . 
  and my god , who can live with himself if he is accused of racism ? 
  at least , this is what / r/worldnews has told me . 
  sometimes i seriously hate that place ... 
  apparently jews have taken control of bulgaria , so this act was completely justified . 
  that , or false flag , of course . 
  also jidf hasbara jewbots . 
  everything makes sense now !, 
  also very relevant with some good analysis http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/world/europe/europe-await-report-on-bulgaria-bombing-for-hezbollah-link.html?pagewanted=all, 
   it is all just a marketing ploy to sell beer and chips and give you the mistaken impression that you are part of a `` community '' while funneling your money into the pockets of some people who are already very wealthy . 
  it is actually also a crime syndicate used for money laundering and fixing matches . 
   it 's kind of hard to do what most here suggest and stay away from storing your data/info on us based clouds that still does n't ensure the us ca n't grab your data http://www.zdnet.com/blog/igeneration/microsoft-admits-patriot-act-can-access-eu-based-cloud-data/11225, 
  would n't help . 
  you might want to look up echelon . 
  you guys are cute . 
  actually , a guy was shot point blank with a gas pistol last week in plovdid , bulgaria , in the * eye * and he lived . 
  he was even allowed to leave the hospital the same day and the doctors just told him to use some eye medicine at home . 
  http://btvnews.bg/kriminalno/mladezh-prostrelya-29-godishen-s-gazov-pistolet-v-plovdiv.html translate it . 
  i guess it is not always lethal . 
  and by `` they '' , of course , you mean the former communist party . 
  you should thank them . 
  it 's not like the people had any say in this . 
  enforcing the law here wo n't do any good . 
  this will only rile up ethnic tensions and the nationalists and the turkish/roma party wo n't shut up over this for weeks . 
  in the end , it will just be done in private , so the effect will be negative . 
  yeah , that 's been happening for ages . 
  it quite literally is a bride market . 
  you go there , pay some money , you get a bride . 
  it 's not a secret or anything , everybody knows about it and there 's reports about it on tv every year . 
  you can get something like 30 euro per month if you are dirt poor , but that requires you to have an address registration . 
  if you are homeless , i think you ca n't collect that . 
  and in order to live in government housing you still need to pay rent which you wo n't be able to afford if you live on that money . 
  here 's the website of the government agency : http://pomosti.oneinform.com/ but if you 've worked recently then you 've been paying `` social insurance '' and you get better welfare for like 1-2 years . 
   and then they will receive no housing , no financial assistance and no healthcare except emergency healthcare . 
  this is exactly what happens to any bulgarian who is unemployed long enough . 
  for asylum seekers who 've been given refugees status , this would take only a few months . 
  so , the vast majority of refugees will be in that position pretty quickly . 
  social services in bulgaria are only available to people who work or who have worked recently . 
  so the hard life for the asylum seekers starts after they are given their refugee status and told to leave asylum centers as they are basically unemployable . 
  despite the constant flow of migrants in the country , the number of asylum seekers / refugees is pretty much constant in bulgaria . 
  that 's because they keep leaving . 
  that guy [ admitted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/3lf9pc/reurope_mod_here_we_need_your_help_reurope_has/cv5tb6n ) that he 's fine with ignoring rules when it suits his personal interests . 
  obviously , he 's a bad choice for mod as it 's unlikely he 'll apply the rules objectively . 
   the fact is such things do n't happen at all in countries of much larger populations so there 's something wrong here . 
  holy shit , how delusional are you ? 
  you think this is only happening in bulgaria ? 
  here are some more violent examples from germany . 
  plenty more if you widen the search to all european countries . 
  http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/15/asylum-seekers-face-increasing-violence-in-germany.html http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/14/world/europe/germany-migrants-attacks-asylum-seekers-backlash.html http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dresden-riots-protesters-in-germany-attack-refugee-buses-shouting-foreigners-out-10467287.html  what , you 'll wait until they beat the living shit out of everyone ? 
  what , you 'll wait until they burn down all asylum centers so that refugees live on the streets ? 
  hah , i replied with the same thing without seeing your comment . 
  it 's too easy to ridicule . 
  if you are dumb enough to base your judgement on isolated incidents , then germany must be hell for migrants seeing how i 've never heard of bulgarians [ burning down an asylum center . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34050393 ), 
  some of their sources are : * a refugee handbook written by ??? 
  * a sociologist widely known for being an imbecile with a terrible track record for any kind of prediction * a single anonymous migrant interviewed by a human rights organisation which is obviously biased because of the wall that was constructed * public opinion is ** `` clearly '' ** against refugees because of unknown numbers of attacks , political rallies and protests against them * after that they point our that there have been no polls on the matter , thereby contradicting themselves * facebook poll quality journalism . 
  i knew what the clip was even before clicking , 
  this article contains too much bullshit . 
  refugees are avoiding bulgaria as end goal because it is the poorest country in the eu . 
  they are avoiding it as a transit country because the border is very well protected and it is very difficult sneaking in undetected . 
  if you get detected in bulgaria , you get registered , which is not the case in countries like hungary and greece because authorities there ca n't cope with that . 
  so that 's the main reason for why human traffickers are avoiding bulgaria . 
  also , bulgaria has the one of the highest , if not the highest rate of acceptance of asylum applications -- 94 % . 
  if the authorities were so racist , they could easily lower it . 
  the most laughable part of the article was about the no contact with foreigners . 
  gypsies are given as an example , but not turks who are the biggest minority and who are muslim ?!? 
  ridiculous . 
  do n't expect any objectivity here . 
  we 've also heard a lot of tough accusations of xenophobia and whatnot about hungary , but that does n't seem to stop anybody from traveling through there .
