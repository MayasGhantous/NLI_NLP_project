  now ask yourself why is that given as the sole reason for avoiding bulgaria , but not hungary . 
  til . 
  now it just has to be announced and put in the sidebar ( and hopefully assign some mods outside of / r/europe ) . 
  i agree . 
  i 've suggested this before and offered to implement it , but my suggestion was ignored . 
  however , the need for more transparency should be more obvious than ever right now . 
  here 's something more concrete : * make a new subreddit called metaeurope or something like that where all meta discussion should go and link it in sidebar/rules . 
  kind of like what / r/anarchism and / r/metanarchism are doing * top mod of the meta-sub should not be a mod of / r/europe * now people can talk about everything mod-related over there instead of here * aside from moderation , anything meta goes there more transparency is the only way to get out of this mess . 
  so what are you going to do ? 
  vote for some party which will never enter parliament ? 
  these two parties are obviously trying to push the law and they will do it if they had a few mps more . 
  the only parties who voted in favor of this are the reformist block and gerb . 
  everybody else voted against or abstained . 
  i think it 's clear who not to vote for . 
  how recent exactly is this ancient thing ? 
  when i was in macedonia in 2006 i spoke to many people my age ( born late 1980s ) and everybody told me that this is what they were taught in school . 
  also , taught in school was how samuil was a macedonian tsar and how the cyrilic alphabet was created in ohrid , therefore macedonian . 
  it looks like this historical bs has been happening at least since the 1990s . 
   we should firstly focus on supporting those countries which are the source of these refugees through financial , logistic and , when necessary , military help in order to create stable and inclusive governments which hold a monopoly on the use of force and use said force responsibly . 
  the countries which are the source of most the refugees going from turkey to europe are syria , afghanistan and pakistan . 
  how exactly would you apply what you are suggesting to any of those countries ? 
  have you even thought for a second if this general bla-bla is even realistic ? 
  take syria . 
  which side do you support there ? 
  isis ? 
  assad ? 
  the `` moderate '' fsa ? 
  other jihadi groups ? 
  your country was sending logistic aid and military aid to the fsa . 
  a lot of those weapons are now in isis hands ( entire warehouses captured ) and much of the aid suspended because of said failure . 
  expecting to support the fsa in order to create a stable government is delusional . 
  just look at the clusterfuck which is syria right now . 
  even russians are fighting on assad 's side . 
  you will not have a `` stable and inclusive governments which hold a monopoly on the use of force and use said force responsibly '' in syria unless we start supporting assad . 
  good luck trying to sell that one to the public when recently there was talk of bombing his government for the use of chemical weapons . 
  take afghanistan . 
  we 've been providing `` financial , logistic and , when necessary , military help '' for 14 years now and still , there 's a steady stream of refugees . 
  the refugees coming from pakistan are coming over precisley because the taliban were pushed in pakistan , because we had to provide `` financial , logistic and , when necessary , military help '' to afghanistan . 
  so , yeah , you 'd have to be a bit more concrete with this stuff if you are looking for realistic solutions and not general feel-good stuff . 
  obviously it 's not the only reason . 
  the fence , monitoring equipment , frequent patrols and general levels of protection makes it very hard to get through undetected , even without the beatings . 
  if it was just the beating , migrants would be going through the turkey-greece land route , but they are not , because there is a fence there as well which is well-protected . 
  instead they are mostly using sea routes . 
  i have n't heard anything about that , but yeah , that 's fucked up if true . 
  there 's a land route from turkey to greece as well . 
  of course , greece also has a border fence there , so that part of the border is as well-protected as the bulgaria-turkey border . 
  thus , if your intention is to go through undetected , your best bet is going through sea . 
  there is nothing illegal about the border fence if that 's what you are talking about . 
  anybody who wishes to apply for asylum in bulgaria can do it at the numerous border checkpoints . 
  the alternative of not having a border fence would be for us to be a transit country where migrants who have not been registered anywhere travel illegally through our territory , not knowing anything about the migrants passing through ( there could be and there are criminals trying to get to europe ) . 
  as for morality , imagine some jihadi cunt coming back from syria , passing through our territory and committing a terrorist attack somewhere in west europe . 
  so the morality of the fence is pretty gray if you ask me . 
  also , without the border protection , we will inevitably end up with the same dilemma which hungary is facing right now -- do we close our eyes to illegal migration ( and break the law and face possible consequences ) so that people can go through to western europe , or do we enforce the laws despite the wishes of the migrants , forcing them to stay and apply for asylum in bulgaria . 
  the eu breaking up is not really in the interest of most countries in western europe . 
  they profit immensely from the eu and the euro , look up what varoufakis has to say on the matter . 
  if britain were to leave eu , you 'd also lose other things rather than cheap labor . 
  the market where british companies are selling their stuff and also it makes setting up foreign branches in the eastern eu states more expensive for example . 
  it 's a huge package deal . 
  also , what has britain contributed to greece ? 
  it 's not as simple as that . 
  there are tons of certifications and standards that eu countries follow so that labour movement is easier . 
  changing that and making all that incompatible with eu standards ( which will probably happen naturally if we are not in the eu ) will kind of ruin the deal and there wo n't be any need to control people 's movement anymore because the west wo n't want it as much anymore . 
  the analogy is perfectly fine . 
  the west wo n't give more money because ** they do n't have to ** . 
  the eastern states ** do n't have to ** agree to a new refugee distribution program . 
  what states have to do is described in law . 
  anyway , i 've replaced it with another analogy which is better and easier to see the point . 
  the point is -- nation states have self-interest which they stick to while following eu law . 
  that 's it mostly . 
   on the other hand most eastern eu states have n't taken any refugees . 
  all eastern states have taken in some refugees . 
  not many , but there are some in all of them . 
  `` being there for each other '' falls under the `` kumbaya shit '' i was talking about . 
  this is not how i see the eu . 
  here 's another question . 
  why did n't the countries outside of the eurozone chip in for greece during the crisis ? 
  for the same reason why the east does n't want to take more refugees -- because there is a set of rules which nation states have to follow and besides that in general they look for their best self-interest . 
  edit : better analogy . 
  so your idea of the european union is that it is some sort of a charity organisation where the rich west gives money to us poor fucks in the east . 
  and that we are just leaching off your glorious money without `` giving anything back '' . 
  how about all those doctors , engineers , all kinds of educated professionals and in general cheap labor that you get ? 
  you are forgetting about that part . 
  the eu is a political-economic union , not a charity organisation , not a solidarity fund or whatever else kumbaya shit you imagine it is . 
  nice save, 
  \\  one person writes a stupid comment \\  condemns entire subreddit / u/thebeercannon, 
  how does this result in more trouble ? 
  if anything , it makes more people to pass through the border checkpoints , which is what a state would want . 
  otherwise , you have no idea who is entering your country and since hungary is in schengen that can be problematic for other countries as well . 
  so apparently illegally entering hungary ( instead of doing it legally via a border checkpoint ) is a nice european value . 
  honestly , this phrase `` european values '' has become totally meaningless -- everybody assigns it whatever meaning he wants to . 
  amusingly , after the collapse of communism in bulgaria in 1990 , all the border barriers were removed because they were considered `` undemocratic '' . 
  same bullshit argument pretty much . 
  those were n't containment threads though , so it 's a pretty big difference . 
  the entire front page was swamped by greece articles , with tons of comments , despite the megathreads . 
  i used to think the same until [ this happened . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_burgas_bus_bombing ), 
  unemployment is down , economy grew . 
  there exactly two soviet soldiers who have died in bulgaria -- they drowned while crossing the danube river . 
  a lot more who raped and stole . 
  what a sacrifice !,
