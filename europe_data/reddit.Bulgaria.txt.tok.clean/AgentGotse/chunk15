  this monument is hated by many people in the country because it glorifies a historical lie . 
  the inscription says : `` to the liberating soviet army from grateful bulgaria '' . 
  the soviet army did n't liberate shit in any sense of the word . 
  i agree with you , but there 's no need to justify the actions of the police here . 
  it 's obvious that entering your country ** illegally ** is not allowed . 
  the fact that you feel you should defend the policemen shows how perverted the discourse on this topic has become -- the default is now to close your eyes to illegal immigration . 
  the legal way to enter a country is through a border checkpoint and following its procedures . 
  there 's an easy way to see deleted comments by simply visiting a few websites . 
  comments linking to these websites got nuked all the time . 
  what 's the point of this ? 
  people will learn of this anyway because you ca n't stop the word of mouth . 
  will this continue in the future ? 
  personally , i think transparency is nice and deleting comments who point this out is a bit too authoritarian for my tastes . 
  * we should have a megathread for this . 
  * a megathread for all the `` how to say some shit in all european languages '' * megathread for maps of europe with respect to something ( e.g. 
  number of cars per person with no legs ) * obviously , a `` fuck russia '' megathread is warranted as well . 
  * might as well throw one for `` stupid shit erdogan says '' . 
  * we already have a `` weekly what happened in your country megathread '' . 
  * whenever a terrorist act happens --  megathread . 
  * super major news --  megathread finally , we will need a megathread megathread because all of the megathreads are covering too much of the front page . 
  got to free it up in order to diversify content . 
  it would take an hour or so apparently . 
  but i 'm not a general , so i have no idea what makes military or political sense when it comes to tactical nukes anyway . 
  there 's plenty of bulgarians studying and working abroad . 
  i am one of those . 
  prospects are excellent basically . 
  but it 's a massive brain drain for the country which is pretty sad , especially in medicine . 
  there have never been any icbms in bulgaria . 
  there were only scud launchers which have nowhere near intercontinental range . 
  basically , the goal was to fire tactical nuclear strikes into greece and turkey in the event of war . 
  in particular , every scud launcher unit was instructed to fire two nuclear strikes at greece or turkey . 
  if they are still alive , fire a third one . 
  at that point , the crew leave the scud launcher and starts running away for their lives because the enemy would have pinpointed their location and the retaliation would be another nuclear strike . 
  you are right about the nuclear heads though . 
  those would be delivered from the soviet union in the event of war . 
  source : my dad was conscripted to serve as a ballistic officer in one of those scud launchers . 
  as someone said yesterday here , the greek people will have to eat shit one way or the other . 
  there are no other options . 
  so choose wisely what kind of shit you want to eat at the referendum . 
  personally , i remember the joys of hyperinflation and banks failing . 
  back then , in january 1997 , the average monthly salary had fallen to the equivalent of 5 us dollars before people had enough and forcibly removed all mps from parliament . 
  so , you know what my opinion is . 
  if you think the comments here on / r/europe are not very symphatetic with greeks , then oh boy , do not venture into bulgarian news websites . 
  almost every single commenter ridicules their government . 
  many parallels are being drawn between the current greek government and the 1997 bulgarian socialist party government during whose time most banks in the country went bust and there was pretty nasty hyperinflation ( as some things to come soon ) . 
  i also know few people who are feeling symphatetic . 
  a popular sentiment these days around here is the old saying : `` but when they were eating the meatballs they were n't crying '' . 
  anyway , that 's just my observation of bulgarian opinions on the matter , so i think the article is right in saying that there is almost no sympathy with the greeks over here . 
  the original thread which you removed had an article in english . 
  now you are linking to some google-translated shit from french . 
  how about adding some proper articles in english ? 
  amazingly not . 
  true to your name , you are experiencing major butthurt because someone does n't like the current government , so he must be a shill or some old corrupt guy ? 
   you even have polaks , bulgarians and estonians looking down at us . 
  it looks like you are the one doing the `` looking down '' at others though . 
   and at the end of the day if i had to decide between the wellfare or image of my nation i would go for the former , every time . 
  it 's not a binary choice . 
  in the event of a default , you will lose both most likely . 
  you are wrong with the numbers . 
  the greek parliamentary committee estimated that germany owes greece [ ** 278.7 billion ** euros ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/06/us-eurozone-greece-germany-reparations-iduskbn0mx1do20150406 ) . 
  out of that , 10.3 billion are the money from the forced loan you are talking about ( with interest and everything according to their own calculations ) . 
  the rest is war reparations which they still think they need to get . 
  so , basically , the greek parliament seems to like issuing declarations which are pretty out of touch with reality , like not having to pay their debts and getting hundreds of billions out of germany . 
  it 's just a pr show for retards basically . 
  greece is still richer than bulgaria in every kind of economic measure that i know of , gdp per capita , gdp per capita adjusted for purchasing power , average salary , median salary , even throwing in the difference in unemployment does n't change any of that , greece is still richer . 
  as for some people not getting their salaries paid , this has been standard operating procedure for shitty businesses in bulgaria for as long as i remember . 
  nothing special about that , unfortunately . 
  as i said , the macedonian ethnicity started to became a thing in the early 20th century . 
  by the 1940s it was probably well-established when bulgarian soldiers were beating up the people you know . 
  however , here we are talking about gotse delchev . 
  you know people who were alive in 1903 when gotse delchev died ? 
  i am not very patriotic and i am not racist at all . 
  you on the other hand should be more skeptical of the bullshit that your government is feeding you . 
  i have provided several sources written by international authors to back up my point . 
  you have n't provided shit other than lying about knowing people who were old enough to remember what happened in 1903 or before or trying to unsuccesfully discredit peer-reviewed authors . 
  you quote is from a review on amazon.com . 
  seriously ? 
  so he wrote a shitty book about stambolov ( according to somebody who wrote a review on amazon.com ) and this immidiately discredits all his books . 
  right , ok . to the contrary on [ jstor ] ( https://www.jstor.org/stable/40106063?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ) the same author is hailed for his impartiality and objectivity in international history review by an american history professor for the book which is actually relevant for the discussion . 
  apparently the author of the book that i linked to ( loring m. danforth ) agrees with both of them . 
  go and read the surrounding pages of his books , he clearly points out in multiple sources that a lot of the people in macedonia identified as bulgarians back then . 
  he is biased as well i suppose ? 
  seriously , what kind of proof would be good enough for you ? 
  yeah , well said . 
  i 'd rather see the monument of the ~ ~ `` liberating '' ~ ~ occupying red army nuked . 
  or maybe make both ? 
  i do n't think the statue is ugly to be honest . 
  i really do n't see what the big deal is constructing a statue for one of the most emblematic rulers in bulgarian history . 
  what about the other then ? 
  he is referring to the slavs as macedonia as bulgarians which includes himself . 
   macedonian nationality is old like greece is . 
  yeah and it all started with alexander the great . 
  the document i was talking about above is bmarc , not imro . 
  gotse delchev was a member of bmarc before imro was even a thing . 
  [ anyway , here is what you asked for . 
  ] ( https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zmeson_hhfec&amp;lpg=pr9&amp;ots=eeydeaixvn&amp;dq=the%20macedonian%20conflict%3a%20ethnic%20nationalism%20in%20a%20transnational%20world&amp;lr&amp;pg=pa64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ) i have a screenshot if the page becomes unavailable . 
  this is from a book by an american anthropology professor with no relationship to bulgaria . 
  quote :  even gotse delchev , the famous macedonian revolutionary leader , whose nom de guerre was ahil ( achilles ) , refers to `` the slavs of macedonia as ` bulgarians ' in an offhanded manner without seeming to indicate that such a designation was a point of contention '' ( perry 1988:23 ) . 
  in his correspondence gotse delchev often states clearly and simply , `` we are bulgarians '' ( mac dermott 1978:273 ), 
  macedonia became a state in the 1940s .
