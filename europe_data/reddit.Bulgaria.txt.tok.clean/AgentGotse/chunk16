  there was no macedonian state before that . 
  as for the ethnicity , that became a thing in the early 20th century and debatebly in late 19th century . 
  for example , revolutionaries like gotse delchev , hristo tatarchev , etc. 
  ( who are hailed as national heroes over in macedonia ) self-identified as bulgarians and referred to the people living in macedonia as bulgarians . 
  this is confirmed by plenty of written correspondance and even official documents signed by them [ ( example : document in the sidebar with translation ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internal_macedonian_revolutionary_organization ) . 
  so , the `` always '' in your post is a period of roughly 100 years . 
  they are going to take out his eyes ? 
  [ the irony ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_of_bulgaria )  after the battle of kleidion , on the order of basil ii the captured bulgarian soldiers were blinded ; one of every 100 men was left one-eyed so as to lead the rest home . 
  [ 118 ] [ 119 ] the blinded soldiers were sent back to samuel who reportedly had a heart attack upon seeing them . 
  he died two days later , on 15 october 1014 . 
  the `` strong division '' is whether the eyes should glow or not . 
  but as always , we like to make a big deal out of nothing . 
  personally , i do n't even care if they glow or not . 
  also , the statue looks badass in my opinion . 
  looking forward to seeing it in person . 
  i think the rusophilia is primarily in the older generation . 
  it is true that in communist times a lot of the pensioners today were much much better of than they are today . 
  that generation got screwed ** big time ** during all of the pension reforms . 
  somebody who spent 40 years of their life working as a teacher during communist times now gets a pension putting him far below the poverty line . 
  yeah , obviously people will be pissed , because `` back then '' this was n't the case . 
  the communists did n't know shit about economics . 
  they had full control of the economy and created an extremely inefficient system . 
  for example , a gigantic industrial complex with no raw materials or water source nearby . 
  this is just plain stupid and in a market economy that thing can not compete no matter what . 
  nobody knows what the thought process behind that decission is , but the most popular explanation is that some communist was from the nearby village and he thought that the village is good for a plant or something like that . 
  another ( nationwide ) example is that unemployment was illegal . 
  the government was required to find a job for every person able to work and every person able to work must have a job . 
  as you can imagine , if you are required to find a job for some guy because the law demands it , a lot of people will be doing bullshit and some efficience can decrease . 
  did you check the logs for the one you linked to or the current post ? 
  i was talking about the one you linked to ( which is clear from my link ) . 
  i was talking about the one which theskynet [ ( and i ) ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/353xdb/muslim_march_against_islamophobia_a_great_watch/ ) linked to . 
  that was removed [ twice actually ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitednationsofreddit/comments/352zic/reurope_englands_largest_muslim_march_in_nelson/ ) . 
  it was removed and then reinstated according to [ this . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitednationsofreddit/comments/355mhh/reurope_muslim_march_against_islamophobia_a_great/ ) edit : so there 's no confusion , i am talking about the one which theskynet [ linked to ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/353xdb/muslim_march_against_islamophobia_a_great_watch/ ) . 
   account age  1 year almost 5 years now . 
   500 + combined karma from any subreddits over 15k karma mostly from / r/linux and / r/europe . 
   be on reddit at least once per day to review the mod queue i am a phd student , so yes , many more than once . 
   have experience as a moderator ( or similar ) not on reddit , but i have moderated debates . 
   do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  no , but i am pretty good with computers , have two degrees in computer science , so i can pick it up pretty fast . 
   what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  i travel between the uk and bulgaria a lot , so mostly utc or utc +2 . 
  i stay up pretty late until 3-4 am utc or so and visit reddit around that time as well . 
   what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe overall , i 've read a lot of very informative posts and i 've read some pretty interesting news which i would n't have been exposed to otherwise . 
  basically , i 've learned a lot from this place . 
  that 's what i like the most . 
  my least favorite thing is the moderation . 
  transparency of the modding is pretty low . 
  i 've seen plenty of threads removed under questionable circumstances which did n't violate any rules and this kind of thing just pisses me of . 
   what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  more transparency of the modding . 
  i think the mods should be here to serve the community , not to push agendas . 
  in particular , we can create another subreddit where posters can discuss all aspects of moderation , complain about threads which have been wrongly removed , etc. 
  [ people can already see what gets removed . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/unitednationsofreddit/search?q=europe+or+%2fr%2feurope&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all )  what would make you a good moderator ? 
  i hate the mentality of `` i know better than you do '' . 
  i will enforce the rules , whether i like them or not and nothing else . 
  also , i am willing to help in improving the transparency of this sub by implementing what i mentioned above and addressing criticism from other posters . 
  if i fail , i will just resign . 
  probably because some mod did n't like the thread . 
  i suggest getting a mod with a mandate to improve the transparency of the modding . 
  currently , the transparency is pretty low . 
  i 've seen several threads removed with zero explanation which in my opinion was done arbitrarily and not according to the rules . 
  looking at other subs , a lot can be done on that front if somebody volunteers to make the changes . 
  edit : this has been the most upvoted post in this thread for a while now , so i think there 's interest for more transparency from / r/europe posters . 
  i was hoping somebody else would step up to do this , but i did n't see anybody , so fuck it , i just applied . 
  then will notice it , but nobody would still care . 
  nobody was forced to become an informer for state security . 
  you had to volunteer for it . 
  this was done for an obvious reason , if you were forced into it , the information you provide would be much less reliable . 
  excellent idea . 
  i will grab a few lads from my local linux user group and we will burn down some shit in downtown sofia . 
  finally people will care !, 
  could n't have said it better . 
  this happened yesterday , so ... 
  happy mayday from milan !, 
  so just like the frankfurt riots then . 
  far-left tourists went over there too to destroy some shit . 
  so what am i looking at ? 
  a group of anarchists ? 
  and as expected , this thread was removed from / r/europe . 
  no explanation again . 
  it was the ucl student union who passed this , but yeah , nus is not much better . 
  instead of working on issues that directly affect student life , they are engaging in political issues which have little to none impact on students , such as issuing declarations on the israel-palestine conflict , promoting blocking israeili stuff etc. 
  because of the horribly politicized nature of the union , many universities have actually voted to disaffiliate with them , so the name is kinda misleading . 
  [ not all universities in the uk are part of nus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_students%27_unions_in_the_united_kingdom_not_affiliated_with_the_nus ) . 
  but that 's made in austria which [ just recognized the armenian genocide ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/33ey5o/austria_recognizes_armenian_genocide/ ) , we need to find something else !, 
  turkish government will be in full butthurt mode tomorrow . 
  parliament denounced that in 2012 . 
  but that does n't make any sense , it was done in 1876 , there was no ice cream in bulgarian villages back then . 
  i was expecting most of that , but i lost it with the comment about the ice cream . 
   `` batak is place without family ice cream hahahahaha '' . 
  what is that guy going on about ? 
  i have no idea . 
  this place is only know for a massacre against bulgarians , nothing else . 
  i think most people are saying that the soviet union fucked things up and that it was better before and after eastern europe was occupied , which i also think is true . 
  i do n't know . 
  how is this even relevant ? 
  a lot of the murdered people had no ties to the government if you are trying to suggest that they deserved it . 
  fuck off with your condescending shit .
