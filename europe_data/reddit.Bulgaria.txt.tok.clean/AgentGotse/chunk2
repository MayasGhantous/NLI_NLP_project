  your argument is a strawman , not you yourself . 
  go and read the wiki page so that you do n't embarass yourself again in the future . 
  the argument that the greek government has used is this :  the fyrom name issue is not simply a dispute over historical facts and symbols . 
  it is a problem with regional and international dimensions , given that fyrom is exercising a policy of irredentism and territorial claims fuelled by the falsification of history and the usurpation of greece 's historical and national heritage . 
  in its current form , the fyrom name issue arose in 1991 , when fyrom declared its independence under the name republic of macedonia . 
  historically , the greek name macedonia refers to the state and civilisation of the ancient macedonians , which beyond doubt is part of greece 's national and historical heritage and bears no relation whatsoever with the residents of fyrom , who are slavs by descent and arrived in region of the ancient kingdom of macedonia at a much later stage . 
  geographically , the term macedonia refers to a broader region that includes portions of the territories of various balkan countries ( mainly greece , fyrom and bulgaria ) . 
  however , the greater part of geographical macedonia coincides with the area covered by the ancient greek macedonia , which lies within the boundaries of modern greece . 
  some 2.5 million greek citizens currently live in the greek part of macedonia , whose inhabitants have called and considered themselves macedonians since time immemorial . 
  the name issue originated in the aftermath of the second world war , when josip broz tito separated the area then known as vardar banovina ( now fyrom ) from serbia , granting it the status of a republic within the new federal yugoslavia , under the name socialist republic of macedonia , concurrently promoting the doctrine of a separate macedonian nation . 
  obviously , the most important reason for opting to promote the doctrine of macedonianism at clear variance with the geographical reality of the broader region of macedonia was his desire to gain access to the aegean sea by cultivating the notion of reunification of all macedonian territories ...  the greek side calls for :  the adoption of a definitive composite name with geographical qualification of the term macedonia , for all purposes ( erga omnes ) and for all uses , so as to avoid confusion with greek macedonia and to put an end to the irredentist policy and territorial aspirations of fyrom ,  that fyrom genuinely renounces the usurpation of historical and national heritage of the greek people ,  endorsement of the definitive solution by the un security council , so as to ensure respect for its implementation . 
  that guy is clearly misrepresenting the greek arguments , hence the strawman . 
  the part exactly is the one-sentence `` summary '' of their arguments and the edit where he lists some nonsensical view of history . 
  the large bulgarian bank is n't bankrupt . 
  a certain oligarch and his party ( delyan peevski and dps ) really wanted this to be the case and clearly used the prosecution and the central bank to attack it , but this is n't the case . 
  the bank can be saved in many different ways without relying on any sort of public funding . 
  seeing that the initial auditors reports were completely fucking bullshit , new ones have been ordered now in order to figure out if there is anything wrong with the bank in the first place ( excluding all the public attention which will in all likelihood cause a bank run when the bank reopens ) . 
  however , the whole media campaign orchestrated by the media empire of that oligarch has worked flawlessly and your post is an example of that -- you think the bank is already bankrupt which is n't the case . 
  it 's not just the economy and education . 
  the poorest muslims in the eu are in bulgaria ( which is the poorest country in the eu ) . 
  most of them live in the rural parts of the country and are considerably poorer than people from the capital for example . 
  as far as education goes , i do n't think there 's a big difference , but the bulgarian education system is not exactly known for being well-funded or anything . 
  yet , i do n't see any of our muslims ( who are a considerable minority ) flying isis flags around or subscribing to radical islam . 
  that , however , is a problem in western european countries . 
  basically , people do n't really care about religion much around here ( christian , muslim , atheist , whatever ) , despite being the poorest people in the eu . 
  to be more specific , the bulgarian air force dropped two bombs on the railway station in edirne on 29.10.1912 during a reconaiscence flight . 
  they figured that even though they are doing reconaiscence they can still drop bombs though . 
  the pilots who did this were called radul milkov and prodan tarakchiev . 
  between 893-927 . 
  during the reign of tsar [ simeon i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simeon_i_of_bulgaria ) . 
  apart from the whole warmongering bs that everybody likes to glorify for some reason , there was a lot of work done culturally . 
  cyrilic alphabet getting spread around the slavic peoples , scholarly activities , good times all around . 
  the parent poster is n't saying that it 's just religion either . 
  it 's not just because of religion , it 's not just because of poverty either . 
  it 's a mix of all kinds of factors , religion and living standard included . 
  if it was just poverty , then you would be seeing romani rioting in the streets as well . 
  they are way poorer and living in much worse conditions right ? 
  yet ( as far as i can tell ) i did n't see any romani in the video . 
  it 's a complex problem and saying that it 's just poverty is as false as saying that it 's just because of religion . 
  i doubt everybody rioting in the video is muslim , i doubt everybody rioting in the video is poor . 
  by the looks of it , the police . 
  why ? 
  fuck if i know . 
   not knowing how to use maymay arrows, 
  can confirm . 
  in my country it 's usually football hooligans who are hired to perform all kinds of shit . 
  the latest example that i know of was during the mass anti-government protests several months ago . 
  they were hired by somebody ( some analysts suspect two oligarchs ) to act as agent-provocateurs during the protests . 
  basically , the protests were too peaceful , so they decided that if they were to get violent , this would undermine them . 
  however , the people were n't stupid , so they just kicked out the hooligans and let the police escort them out on multiple occassions . 
  there were some media reports about this , apparently the hiring price was around 15 euro per person . 
  so , yeah , they take that money to undermine the biggest and most peaceful protests the country has seen since 1990 . 
  shame . 
  they have also been engaged in a lot of shady shit in the past few years as well , protecting certain political interests etc. 
  an interpol arrest warrant was ignored for [ agim ceku ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agim_%c3%87eku ) who has been accussed of war crimes in serbia . 
  so , yeah , it can easily happen . 
  i 've seen a good deal of executions and shit in syria , but this is by far the worst . 
  these people can only be described as barbarians . 
  piles of beheaded corpses lying in the street while their heads are atached to spikes with isis flags flying in the background in the middle of a very busy central square in the city . 
  this is just pure terrorism , they want the whole world to see their attrocities . 
  fuck these guys and anybody who is waving their flag . 
  wtf , he should n't have written anything . 
  the eu has n't done shit for over a year now and it will continue not doing shit . 
  you can start here though : https://prism-break.org/en/, 
  yeah , no doubt . 
  i will open a bottle of fine liqour to celebrate with my rommate . 
  as for the banking crisis -- it only concerns one specific bank ( ktb ) which is owned by an oligarch ( tsvetan vasilev ) . 
  there was nothing wrong with the bank from a financial or economic point of view . 
  the crisis was artificially induced by the media empire of another oligarch ( delyan peevski , mp from dps party ) which caused a bank run by spreading bullshit rumours about the bank and forced the central bank to move in . 
  depressingly , the prosecution also helped this , by coming up with some idiotic story how people linked to vasilev were trying to assassinate peevski , however all people who were accussed of this were released on the same day , because of a `` complete lack of evidence '' according to the courts . 
  because of how idiotic this was , the prosecution dropped the charges after a few days , but the damage was done as the media empire of that guy went nuts . 
  the crisis was then made worse with help from the central bank and the prosecution which are both spreading ridicolous lies and acting like pr agencies for that oligarch ( peevski ) and his party ( said party was a colation partner of this government ) . 
  to get a sense of the lies , both the central bank and the prosecution were initially claiming that over 100 million euros were taken out of the bank by somebody linked to vasilev ** in cash ** in the time span of ** 1 day ** . 
  now , after all this time has passed , the current version which the prosecution maintains is that this happened during ** 3 years ** , ** no cash ** was taken out and there was a `` simulated '' transaction ( whatever the fuck that means ) and it is still ** not clear whether any money was actually taken out ** !!!, 
  it 's just a pr show with the intention to discredit the bank . 
  there have been dozens of political commentators , economists , all kinds of banking experts , people who worked for the central bank before , politicians , journalists and whatnot who have straighforwardly called out the central bank on its bullshit ( they are also lying about documents missing about credits worth of 3.5 billion who can now apparently never be found ) in all sorts of media -- national tv , internte news sites , newspapers , you name it . 
  the central bank has lost all trust , nobody believes a word they are saying anymore . 
  there is nothing wrong with the bank and a bailout ( which the central bank said was necessary ) is completely not needed . 
  the bank can be saved ( we do n't even know if there is anything wrong with it because of all their lies ) without the need to get money out of the taxpayers . 
  the investors of the bank have all said they have more than enough funds to increase the capital and liquidity of the `` failing '' bank in order to save it . 
  this headline is completely idiotic . 
  it 's hard for me to imagine how deluded you have to be to consider that guy a technocrat . 
  also , do n't think that he is resigning because of the bank crisis . 
  it was already agreed that the government will be resigning before the banking crisis happened , so that there would be elections in october . 
  the banking crisis happened after it was known when the new elections will be and the approximiate date the resignation would be handed in . 
  also , good fucking riddance . 
  fuck these communist bastards . 
  worst government by far since 1997 ( when it was the same morons in power ) . 
  should have resigned a long time ago . 
  this is great news . 
  especially after the nsa revelations , governments should do their best to distance themselves from the american tech sector . 
  this is also a small step towards this . 
  it is also a strike against vendor lock-in which should benefit everybody overall , as monopolies are not exactly a good thing . 
  still a long way to go in the rest of europe though .

  i 've been a student in the uk for a few years now and i have talked to some of my friends who are studing copyright law about the existing legislation . 
  it 's basically almost impossible to get law enforcement on you for copyright infringement and there are very very few cases where the companies have pursued copyright infringement against regular users .
