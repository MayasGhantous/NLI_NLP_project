  talking the talk basically . 
  but now with the migrant crisis europe has a chance to walk the walk and you see what happens . 
  obvious human rights violation in the face of austria and eu-wide scramble on how to figure out how to prevent migrants entering europe while still pretending we care about their human rights . 
  so why are n't they being sent back to bulgaria then ? 
  under the already agreed one-off quota thing , bulgaria apparently does n't have enough refugees and we need to take in more . 
  but almost nobody has been sent back via dublin regulation or the quota mechanism . 
  it is because , as i said , this thing simply does not work . 
  you can send people back to bulgaria and italy right now because of the dublin regulation , but this almost never happens . 
  same shit with the permanent quotas you keep talking about , it will simply not work because deportations are ugly , legally complicated and most importantly there will be little girls crying on tv which will lower politicians pr . 
  plus , of course , there is also always the greek strategy -- make your country so shit for refugees that the courts decide it is against their human rights to be sent there . 
  this can very easily be arranged in eastern europe , i assure you . 
  after the massive ethnic cleansing which happened via multilateral signed agreements between the balkan states , nobody in their right mind would consider northern greece to be slavic even way back in the 1930s . 
  there were barely any slavs left then . 
  even in ottoman times i am pretty sure the slavs did n't outnumber the greeks . 
  so by limiting the number of asylum requests austria will consider , this is clearly in violation of a bunch of international treaties . 
  now , i obviously understand why this is happening , but what will be the consequences for austria ? 
  i have no idea . 
  but i am guessing there will be none . 
  also , when will the media and international community accuse austria of fascism etc. ? 
  cause i am not seeing much of a furore anywhere right now , but i do recall that hungary got a lot of shit for what they did over the summer , some of it coming from austria no less . 
  in principle yes , in reality it does n't happen very often . 
  example : quite a few bulgarian gypsies are living in france illegally but are not getting deported . 
  also there have been very very few returns of refugees to bulgaria under the dublin regulation . 
  deportations are easier said than done . 
  greece is about to get fucked big time . 
  combining this news plus the news in the other thread where the eu is setting a deadline for greece to fix its borders ( basically impossible ) then the writing on the wall is clear . 
  as we would say in bulgaria in this case : eu countries are sharpening the knife . 
  it 's obvious who the pig is . 
  well , bulgaria is a border country too , so we might get fucked as well . 
  wo n't be as bad as greece though , as our borders are mostly land . 
  so plan a is to have non-eu countries do the dirty work which the eu and eu countries do n't want to do . 
  plan b is to turn greece in a refugee camp . 
  this is just becoming pathetic . 
   also the risk of homelessness and no medical care is complete bs . 
  they receive rent free accommodations and have medical staff on sight , which is more than most remote villages can claim . 
  that 's if you are an asylum seeker . 
  once you are granted refugee status it wo n't be long before you are out on the streets . 
  which is of course the same treatment that any bulgarian who does n't own his home or ca n't pay for accommodation will receive . 
  so , if half of the children are boys , then we get 61 % males . 
  of course , in reality , more than half of the children are male as some of them lie about their age to get asylum more easily . 
  i also remember the incidents in france . 
  well , on those three topics the commenters usually heavily disagree with the editorial line and tear the articles to pieces . 
  but sure , it 's too toxic !, 
  i 'm looking forward to seeing the guardian 's caricature on the matter where the german government is compared to nazis , just like they did with the danish government . 
  it just got removed from here as well . 
  isis just released a video of the paris attackers where they are beheading people and talking about the ( future at the time ) attack in paris . 
  the end of the video strongly suggests that the next target is the uk . 
  this is just becoming farcical now . 
  i am curious how many welfare checks that guy has been cashing in simultaneously . 
  that guy will probably become the poster child for the anti-migrant crowd . 
  this is just fucking ridiculous . 
  easy , any roma ghetto will do . 
  i present to you stolipinovo , plovdiv : [ one ] ( http://i.trafficnews.bg/2015/06/30/a85650d8cb849d263365340d11ca984c.jpg ) [ two ] ( http://www.razruha.ru/data/media/4058/1380798323ed2.jpg ) [ way more ] ( https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bf%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be+%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%b2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjjufmjr7nkahvfwz4khck3b0kq_auiccgc&amp;biw=1715&amp;bih=1012# ), 
  [ other things are on the rise as well . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/o4twi1i4_nk?t=32 ) note , this is from summer 2014 ( discussed in article ) in berlin . 
  i doubt the situation has improved now with 1 million refugees from countries that do n't hold jews in high regard , to put it mildly . 
  for those who do n't speak german , this is a video of a crowd yelling certain things , among which you can hear : '' `` jude jude feiges schwein '' ( jew , jew cowardly pig ) , `` allahu akbar '' and of course `` takbir '' ,, 
  solenka means salty in bulgarian . 
  so it 's a very appropriate choice of username !, 
  i will leave the lobbying to you . 
  what ? 
  here we are talking about deportation of criminals . 
  that you can do with eastern europeans . 
  the rest of your ramblings are irrelevant and pretty stupid . 
  that is something which will actually be useful , but it 's not discussed in the article . 
  the eu tried to deal with erdogan and it 's not working very well , so do n't hold your breath . 
  people from syria ca n't be deported neither people facing persecution or others for which the government does n't know where they are from . 
  the difficulties are the same as before . 
  dust in the eyes as we say in my country . 
  faster deportation means little when deportation is almost impossible in the first place . 
  and at a time when france is in a state of emergency . 
  i think you are replying to the wrong guy . 
  i was implying that something does n't add up in the parent poster 's account . 
  i just replied to one of your previous comments here where you said that the police knew women were being sexually assaulted on the same night . 
  know you are saying according to the police the night was peaceful . 
  so what is it in the end ? 
  disperse the crowd and prevent further sexual assault . 
  now that 's what i call a spectacular failure . 
  you ca n't protect anybody in that crowd no matter what . 
  in eastern europe though , leaving a facebook post on the wall of one of the football hooligan groups would lead to this situation getting quickly resolved . 
  [ article in english from the bbc . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35231046 ) [ much more detailed article from the guardian . 
  ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/05/germany-crisis-cologne-new-years-eve-sex-attacks ), 
  in bulgaria it is very simple . 
  you can say whatever you want and any statement you give simply can not be used against you in a court of law , unless it was given in the presence of an attorney in a specified interrogation room . 
  of course , this does n't mean it is a good idea to speak out your mind if you are suspected of a crime . 
  legally it does n't matter but it is just common sense to stfu and wait for a lawyer if you are accused of something . 
  roma migration . 
  or you can look at gore and see the exact reality for yourself . 
  some of them . 
  the eu students pay the same taxes as british students . 
  the non-eu students get milked pretty hard though . 
  also , i am a foreign phd student in the uk and i am not profitable at all , since i am on scholarship paid for by the british government . 
  obviously , plenty of other people are like me as well . 
  the woman 's testimony being worth less than a man 's testimony in some cases is clearly stated in the quran . 
  obviously , this wo n't ever get banned and some people will keep up living with cognitive dissonance . 
  plenty of islamic scholars are also arguing that women 's testimony is in some cases not acceptable at all . 
  if it 's just socio-economic factors and perceived oppression , then why are n't gypsies committing terrorist attacks ? 
  they are one of the worst , if not the worst , affected group by those factors in many european countries . 
  obviously , religion plays a crucial role in this .
