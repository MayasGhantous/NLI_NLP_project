  yesterday i read an editorial on the guardian about migration . 
  [ basically in the guardian view ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-global-migration-its-part-of-europes-future ) , immigration is required and needed in order to support the next generation of pensioners . 
  one week ago there was a [ similar news story ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/05/robot-revolution-rise-machines-could-displace-third-of-uk-jobs ) about robots and automation . 
  this article is from yesterday and is even specifically about britain -- 15 million jobs are threatened . 
  of course , in their editorial , they completely ignored the rise of automation which clearly negates the need for immigration . 
  it was created by balkantourist ( commie bulgaria tourist agency ) in 1956 . 
  the very thought of putting water in rakia disgusts me . 
  yeah , raki is more like ouzu because it contains anasin . 
  most kinds of rakia do n't have any anasin . 
  hahaha , the police are overpaid like crazy and their salaries keep on increasing way more than any other government employees , while frankly , not deserving the raise at all . 
  finally there is a government willing to stop this nonsense and then police go and organize several ** illegal ** , i repeat , ** illegal ** , protests blocking key infrastructure . 
  absolutely no sympathy for the policemen . 
  that was the bulgars which nobody identifies as anymore . 
  bulgarians are a bit different . 
  he was fired on with a rocket propelled grenade ( rpg ) if there 's any confusion . 
  i voted against e-voting because it is extremely difficult to secure and i do not have a single doubt in my mind that the government will fuck it up . 
  nobody in bulgaria is taking the security argument seriously , so of course , the system wo n't be secure . 
  until that changes and there are concrete promises and assurances for how exactly and under what conditions the system would be discontinued if found to be not secure , i wo n't change my mind . 
  edit : fucking lol . 
  the servers of the central election authority collapsed after a ddos attack . 
  this only strengthens my conviction that electronic voting will be a disaster . 
  thanks , i was too lazy to seek a source . 
  construction began when oresharski was prime minister . 
  i remember that very well . 
  so that 's either 2013 or 2014 . 
  only the police was armed . 
  do you know what the laws and procedures are for such a situation ? 
  because i do n't and that 's why i am not jumping to conclusions . 
  maybe waiting for backup was not an option given that the crowd was getting aggressive ? 
  they were initially 3 policemen chasing 10 people . 
  then they stubmled onto a group of 54 people . 
  the part with the guns was made up by novanews which is a media channel . 
  officials never said they were carrying guns . 
  well , yeah , obviously nothing will change after this . 
  all of this requires money which wo n't be given and effort which wo n't happen . 
  what will happen is that there will be an investigation and then `` lessons will be learned '' !, 
  he never said that . 
  the media fucked up and made it up . 
  the rumour traces back to novanews last night in particular . 
  they were n't making it up . 
  initial reports last night did say the group was armed . 
  almost nobody here owns firearms . 
  bulgaria was just making and selling a lot of weapons during communist times . 
  they are all mostly in storage . 
  my grandfather has worked for over 40 years in the biggest weapons manfucatring plant and even he does n't own a gun , even though he could have easily made himself one plenty of times , 
   to be fair , i 'm more worried that a trained , experienced [ 1 ] policeman produced a warning shot , into the air , under a bridge . 
  what did he expect to happen ? 
  you know very well what experienced means . 
  that he 's spent 20 years or so in the border guard . 
  i doubt he received any training saying `` do n't fire warning shots under a bridge '' . 
  border guards almost never fire their guns anyway . 
  if you are under a bridge and you are afraid for your life , where you going fire anyway ? 
  sideways ? 
  turn your back to the crowd and fire behind you ? 
  do n't shoot ? 
  he was surrounded by people with a factor of more than 16 to 1 who were getting aggressive , he does n't have much time to think and react . 
  but , yeah it 's easy for armchair experts in ballistic over the internet to figure out that if you fire a bullet in a bridge then somebody dies . 
  nobody was carrying arms , that 's old information and not what the guy you are replying to is saying . 
  they got aggressive , got into a fight with the border guards . 
  then the warning shot ricochetted and killed a guy . 
  that 's the official info so far . 
  this was not said during the press-conference . 
  i 've also read a bunch of articles in bulgarian media and nobody used that word . 
  it 's just the bbc . 
  update info , translated from [ here ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/16/2630116_spored_mvr_granicharite_iznenadvashto_se_natuknali_na/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/16/2630011_rikoshet_ot_izstrel_vuv_vuzduha_e_purvoto_obiasnenie/ ) which is a decent source : * the bullet which killed the guy ricocheted of the bridge under which a group of over 40 migrants were hiding * they were 30 km inside the country but it still falls under the jurisdiction of the border guard * three border guards chased a group of 10 people who they were trying to detain * the group of 10 people led them to the bridge where they found over 40 people who are believed to have waited for smugglers to take them from there onwards * all 54 migrants were men and none of them had any id , ages between 20 and 30 and in good physical shape , from afghanistan * they tried to detain them and some of the migrants became aggressive and entered into a fight with the border guards * warning shot is fired then which ricohets in the bridge and wounds a migrant * that guy later dies in hospital from his wound * investigation has started * there was previous information in the media that there was a shootout . 
  that 's was confirmed false and there was exactly one bullet fired in total * source is ministry of interior, 
  you 'd have to wait quite a lot . 
  the only investigation will be done by bulgarian authorities and this is slow as molases . 
  latest information , translated from [ here ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/16/2630116_spored_mvr_granicharite_iznenadvashto_se_natuknali_na/ ) and [ here ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/16/2630011_rikoshet_ot_izstrel_vuv_vuzduha_e_purvoto_obiasnenie/ ) which is a decent source : * the bullet which killed the guy ricocheted of the bridge under which a group of over 40 migrants were hiding * they were 30 km inside the country but it still falls under the jurisdiction of the border guard * three border guards chased a group of 10 people who they were trying to detain * the group of 10 people led them to the bridge where they found over 40 people who are believed to have waited for smugglers to take them from there onwards * all 54 migrants were men and none of them had any id , ages between 20 and 30 and in good physical shape , from afghanistan * they tried to detain them and some of the migrants became aggressive and entered into a fight with the border guards * warning shot is fired then which ricohets in the bridge and wounds a migrant * that guy later dies in hospital from his wound * investigation has started * there was previous information in the media that there was a shootout .

  none of these people had any id on them according to official information . 
  so it could n't have been done anyway . 
   where is your proof that these '54 young males ' were suddenly ` aggressive ' , all over bulgarian media . 
  this is what was said during the press conference in the morning . 
  in the subthread , you have agreed that the liberty to insult others is not debatable . 
  you obviously have taken the liberty to insult large parts of the reddit userbase in this comment . 
  however , you are upset that this `` jerkoff '' is doing the same , but to religious people . 
  so , what are the correct circumstances to make use of the liberty to insult others ? 
  let me quote you from one of your other comments . 
   `` you 're doing the same thing the guy 's doing and bringing up this position even if nobody in this discussion is supporting it . 
  it 's a way to get away from the current debate and over onto the easier terrain ... '' literally nobody is saying people should be dicks all the time other than you . 
  you are complaining about a strawman , only to construct a strawman yourself . 
  nobody in this entire thread has said that people should be dicks all the time other than you . 
  a fall in unemployment is a fall in unemployment . 
  it 's just a fact . 
  who exactly is hypocritical ? 
  many european countries have n't managed that , so it seems like a nice achievement to me . 
  was this made unironically ? 
  i ca n't tell . 
  for the [ refugees in bulgaria ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/09/28/2617647_nad_11_700_bejanci_sa_potursili_zakrila_v_bulgariia_ot/ ) , it is 24 % no education , 30 % basic education , 26 % high school , 6 % university grade education . 
  that was nus which is the national union of students . 
  they have managed to do even more dumb stuff than this on multiple occasions . 
  am i right about the infantry too ? 
  he 's right in the same way as i am right by saying that tanks and the infantry could n't have stopped 9/11 , so the uk should also decomission all of its tanks and the infantry force . 
  since he is the sole author , the gpl or bsd would n't have salvaged any future versions of the software , only the ones previously released . 
  he can relicence future version however he likes since he holds the copyright . 
  you can not retroactively change the license of already released software , so the versions which he had released before could still be used under the previous terms , assuming people have copies of the software etc. 
  sure and we 're going to do that by shitposting anecdotes and you claiming bulgarians are inferior . 
  look , seriously , fuck you . 
  you obviously do n't know what you are talking about but you still have the nerve to write like a condescending cunt in your previously replies .
