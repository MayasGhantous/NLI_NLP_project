  and talking about being disingenuous why do n't you look at the shit you are writing ? 
  as if eradicating racism will actually make bulgaria desirable for refugees . 
  it wo n't because it 's poor as fuck . 
  yes , that 's true . 
  the article points it out actually . 
  here 's the whole paragraph translated :  most refugees sent back come from belgium , austria and germany . 
  in the same time , the requests/queries for applying the legislation are much more than the refugees who have been actually sent back -- to this date for 2015 they are 6963 and for 2014 there have 7851 queries/requests sent to the bulgarian authorities . 
  ( queries are from other eu countries for bulgaria to take responsibility for the return and they concern people in other countries which have applied for asylum there , but according to the rules of the dublin iii treaty those countries consider that bulgaria is responsible for the processing of asylum ) i 'm not sure if query or request or inquiry is the better translation . 
  but yeah , it concerns dublin and deportations back to bulgaria where refugees were registered . 
  right , so germans must be even worse because they are burning down refugee centres . 
  bulgaria seems like a paradise compared to that . 
  why do you think bulgarians are more xenophobic ? 
  at least we are not burning down refugee centres like some people in some other countries with superior cultures . 
  also , you should review rule 1.1 . 
  i think i 'm consistent . 
  i 've seen plenty of interviews and opinions of experts ( people working with refugees ) who are saying the same thing as me . 
  anyway , here 's the more consistent version , i just gave that guy as an example : in sofia there certainly are jobs as the unemployment is very low . 
  the actual problem is that in order to get one of those , refugees need to speak bulgarian which they ca n't . 
  learning bulgarian takes time and effort during which time they have to live on welfare which is crap . 
  however , welfare in the west is better and they have better integration problems and the countries are richer , so they are naturally more desirable . 
  i am not surprised at all , i just don ' think it 's because of the reasons stated by the parent comment . 
  i do n't know about the refugees but almost all muslims born in bulgaria are sunni . 
  in sofia there certainly are jobs as the unemployment is very low . 
  that does n't stop that afghan guy interviewed by al jazeera from complaining . 
  the actual problem is that in order to get one of those , he needs to speak bulgarian which he ca n't . 
  learning bulgarian takes time and effort during which time that guy has to live on welfare which is crap . 
  however , he 's fine with doing that in france where he wants to study law . 
  studying in university while on welfare in bulgaria is pretty much impossible , so that 's a problem with the welfare system . 
  i agree it 's obvious why people are traveling to the richer countries , that 's just common sense as they have better standard of living . 
  i am pretty sure the part where it 's said they do n't want to stay in bulgaria is about the parents , not the kids . 
  some refugee numbers for bulgaria which you might find interesting [ from here which is a reputable source  ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/09/28/2617647_nad_11_700_bejanci_sa_potursili_zakrila_v_bulgariia_ot/ ) * 386 refugees deported back to bulgaria from other eu countries since the beginning of ** 2014 ** . 
  most are from belgium , austria and germany . 
  * 14814 ( 6963 for 2014 ; 7851 for 2015 ) requests from other eu contries bulgaria to accept back refugees first registered in bulgaria ( i assume it 's hard to accommodate them all or maybe problems with deportations ) * for 5 years bulgaria has granted asylum to 14630 refugees ( note , registering somebody is not the same as granting or even applying for asylum ) * most refugees from syria , afghanistan and iraq with iraq rising rapidly * 56 % men , 13 % women , 31 % kids * 24 % no education , 30 % basic education , 26 % high school ? , 6 % university grade education * 75 % of syrians citiziens are kurds * capacity left for accommodating 5130 more asylum seekers, 
  if you are interested in just blaming just one side , sure that works . 
  but , if the vast majority of bulgarians are super racist , then maybe it 's a bad idea to redistribute refugees to bulgaria then ? 
  should probably tell that to merkel and company . 
  because there obviously wo n't be a fancy eu program or whatever that will change the attitude of bulgarian society soon . 
  [ not really . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mt0od/nikola_kazakov_chairman_of_national_refugee/cvhx3sk ) honestly , would you actually live in bulgaria ? 
  you do n't know the language , so you are basically unemployable unless you are a software engineer or something like that . 
  then you only get welfare for some time which dooms you into a miserable life . 
  actually , refugees are allowed to work everywhere in the eu . 
  asylum seekers are n't , but they can start as soon as they get their refugee status . 
  that would explain a small number of cases . 
  the vast vast majority do n't want to stay because `` there are no jobs '' , `` the country is poor '' , `` i have family in western european country '' , etc. 
  this has been confirmed time and again by numerous interviews from all kinds of news agencies . 
  here 's one from [ al jazeera . 
  ] ( http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/17/in-bulgaria-refugee-struggle-underlines-evasive-european-dream.html ), 
  you are talking about a man who supports the ira killing british soldiers and policemen and who is still to this day trying to figure out how to give the falklands to argentina . 
  support for organisations that have nothing fto do with britain is not so surprising . 
  the criteria is `` do n't be gypsy '' . 
  of course , not officially . 
  officially , they require that the number of asylum requests ( aka a scheme to leech some money ) drops below some threshold . 
  that 's my entire point : the country is run by idiots so inevitably 1997 will repeat . 
  and then the euro wo n't save us and we are fucked . 
  signal 's source code has already been publicly audited by professionals and further audits may be arranged of course . 
  also they have done a lot of work on reproducible builds so your argument does n't hold much water . 
  neither of this holds true for whatsapp so the trust requirements are way higher . 
  everything changes when a financial crisis occurs . 
  the peg can be nuked and we have full control of the currency . 
  with the euro you eat whatever shit other countries decide like we have already seen with the greeks . 
  i do n't want the euro , so no thanks . 
  the euro is very poorly thought out and has huge problems . 
  seeing what kind of morons are running the country , when we hit a major financial crisis we will be greece 2.0 if we adopt the euro and we will be eating the same shit as the greeks . 
  with the current system if the situation becomes really bad we can remove the currency board and sort out things . 
   bulgaria - anelia nope.avi she is by no means the most successful artist around here . 
  the biggest monument in sofia says that . 
  complete historical lie , but such is life in bulgaria . 
  not big surprise , he 's been shitting on the eu for over 30 years . 
  would n't be surprised if one of those bright chaps pleads the fifth upon getting arrested .

  i am an article 4 free inhabitant and i do not consent to any joinder with any other individual . 
  i am just saying that anyone can freely travel to / r/amibeingdetained ( as long as they do not engage in commerce , of course ) . 
  this reminds me of the sovereign citizen idiots . 
  shoutout to / r/amibeingdetained .

   how long do you think will be the longest that any major company clings to windows 7 to save transition costs ? 
  woah , woah , woah , hold your horses there cowboy . 
  government it round these parts is still on windows xp which is horribly insecure and is now 2 years past end of life . 
  i am guessing we are looking at at least 5 years unsupported here . 
  i missed the flag thing . 
  please bring me in the loop . 
  you should make up your mind on what you are running then . 
  because you were initially going on about how it is finnish , now it is mostly german apparently . 
  i am not saying your os is american , i am saying it is ** more ** american than it is finnish , which is what you were initially claiming . 
  kde is an international project and i will be seriously surprised if most of the code you are running is more german than american . 
  do n't forget the gnu part which is gigantic . 
  linux is not finnish lol . 
  even if you count only the kernel , a tiny part of the code is written by linus . 
  the biggest single contributor is red hat which is an american corporation . 
  fuckton of volunteers and other organisations are also american . 
  and as i am sure you know that the kernel is a tiny part of the os as dear leader stallman has said multiple times . 
  both linux and gnu plus linux are both more american than they are finnish . 
  what operating system are you using ? 
  that happened 6 years ago , a very apt time for a protest .
