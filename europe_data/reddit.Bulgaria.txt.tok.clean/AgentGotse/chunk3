  with this development , it becomes clear that the copyright industry is moving to the same tactics which are being employed in the usa . 
  namely that `` several strikes and you are out '' system . 
  basically , instead of enganging the courts in the matter ( which is expensive , time consuming and has nasty stuff such as `` the defendent is innocent until proven otherwise '' ) , the gigantic copyright groups are striking deals with major isps so that they would cut your internet access after you are caught pirating ( and that is determined by them , no courts involved ) . 
  so basically , they just established the same mechanisms which are in use in the usa , the only difference is that your internet connection wo n't be blocked after you receive a bunch of letters ... for now . 
  in a few years time , there will be some more meetings and this time around it will be much easier for the copyright groups to convince the isps to aslo cut your connection as well . 
  i can already see the arguments : `` well , you see , the current strategy is not working very well , bla bla bla , the mechanisms for this are already in place , bla bla bla , you should those mechanisms to cut the connection bla bla bla , if you do n't do this we will figure out how to fuck you bla bla bla done '' . 
  edit : also , the title is just flat out wrong . 
  nothing has been decriminalised . 
  the law has not changed at all , it 's literally the same as before . 
  you can still get sued for copyright infringement in exactly the same way as before . 
  the only difference is that the copyright groups have now striked a deal with the isps and ( apparently ) they wo n't be pursuing small-time home users for copyright infringement . 
  i know , i was just joking . 
  one of the [ linked articles below ] ( http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4133664.ece ) talks about how french jews are moving to israel because of these kinds of attacks . 
  so these rioters are making israel stronger ? 
  half of the seaside estate in bulgaria is already owned by russian citiziens . 
  putin just needs to supply some weapons and then come up with a version of how the local concerned citizens actually found the weapons in baba penka 's farm and then rebelled against the bad government . 
  no warships necessary . 
   at least in sofia , they are notorious for driving really fast and ignoring all traffic laws known to man i suppose some of you are thinking `` b-b-but agentgotse , why are the marshrutka drivers driving like idiots and endangering the lives , health and safety of the passengers and themselves just so that they can make more money for the marshrutka company ? '', 
  to that i will first condescingly laugh and then reply with : `` well , because corruption son . '', 
  you see , technically , once you get in you pay and then you should get a ticket . 
  but if the driver gives you a ticket , then that money mostly goes to the company . 
  so in many cases , the driver wo n't give you a ticket and keep the money for himself . 
  then , he will drive like an idiot in order to stay ahead in front of one of the other marshrutkas which are going on a route which is overlapping with this one so that he can get some of the customers before the competition and keep some of the money for himself . 
  this was definitely happening way more frequently before . 
  before there was also many standing passenger for the marshrutkas , which is , of course , illegal . 
  but nobody gave a fuck to that point that the marshrutka companies were installing railings so that people who stand up can hold onto something . 
  marshrutkas cost 1.5 leva while all other tickets for public transport is 1 lev . 
  we have those in sofia as well . 
  we also call them `` marshrutkas '' ( \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0438 in cyrilic ) . 
  [ a photo ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/shimg/zx450y250_552164.jpg ) . 
  basically , for those who do n't know , they are a form of public transportation . 
  they have a fixed route and can stop anywhere along the route if a passenger wishes to get in/out . 
  they are more expensive than other forms of public transportation ( bus , tram , underground ) , but they are usually faster . 
  at least in sofia , they are notorious for driving really fast and ignoring all traffic laws known to man ( it 's gotten better in recent years though ) . 
  there was also a pretty popular joke here some time ago . 
  it goes like : - `` do you know why michael schumahher quit from formula 1 ? '', 
  - `` no , why ? '', 
  - `` to join the real competition , driving on the mashrutka 1 route . '', 
  well , if you want to go all anal about it , the slogan does n't say anything about palestinians either , it just says something about palestine . 
  as i said , i 'm not very advanced in the matter and i am certainly not familiar with the propaganda on either side , but the way that i personally interpreted it was that israel should n't exist in palestinian territories which apparently includes all of the present day territory of israel . 
  now what the `` canonical '' interpretation of the slogan is , i have no idea . 
  i do n't know , but after [ shitposting like that ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ba29n/looting_in_paris_as_europeans_protest_against/cj3ci5c ) i really hope his mod application gets turned down . 
  i 'd prefer not to have people with censorship power in this sub acting like morons during a meltdown . 
  first , i would like to say that this thread is shit . 
  secondly , i attended a ( peaceful ! ), 
  protest here in my university town ( i study in the uk ) to protest against the aggression in gaza . 
  it was all good and peaceful and everything , but very soon people started shouting `` from the river to the sea , palestine will be free '' . 
  now , i am not very advanced in the israel-palestine conflict , but i took this to mean that palestine should extend from the sea to the jordan river and basically leaving no room for israel . 
  i thought that was a ridicolous demand , so i just left at this point , because i did n't want to be associated with this . 
  i have no idea how many white muslims are in france and it does n't matter . 
  what i was trying to say is that islamphobia and racism are different and not all islamophobes are racists . 
  if you want to criticise the guy for being islamophobic , go ahead ( because he clearly is an islamophobe ) , but pulling the race card is disingenuous . 
  it 's all i was trying to say really . 
  there is nothing to pussyfoot around , in his first sentence he clearly said `` out of fear of islamophobia '' . 
  it is clear he is talking about muslims , he has mentioned nothing about their ethinicity . 
  plus , in some of your [ other posts in this thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ba29n/looting_in_paris_as_europeans_protest_against/cj3c6wa ) , you are clearly trying to equate islam with race , which you need to admit is massive bullshit . 
  come over to the balkans , plenty of white muslims over here if you do n't believe me . 
  plus , there are plenty of arabs who are not muslim and there are plenty of arabs who seem pretty white to me at least . 
   edit : so the downvotes are telling me that white people have never looted anything before ? 
  damn , i need to brush up on my history to be sure about this . 
  no , i am not telling you that . 
  i am telling you that you look ridicolous with all that editing and strawman bullshit . 
  the guy you are replying to is not even talking about race , you are . 
  call him an islamaphobe if you want , but what he said is not racist , no matter how hard you want to spin it . 
  i also downvote anyone who is complaining about downvotes . 
  for the record , i also downvoted the post you replied to as well . 
  meanwhile south stream is being made and [ austria signed the deal three weeks ago ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/28z2hc/austria_signs_russian_pipeline_deal_south_stream/ ) . 
  it 's all business as usual . 
  the eu is worthless on the matter . 
  i downvoted him hoping that he will continue editing . 
   open source = open development , meaning we can view the source and create around it no idea what you are trying to say here . 
   if the nsa wants to know what you 're doing their is nothing you can really do . 
  they just simply have more resources . 
  yes , you can . 
  collecting emails while they are in transit is much safer than hacking into a government official 's computer . 
  if your entire organisation is using encryption properly and applies good security practices , the nsa wo n't be able to spy on you without infiltrating your computer systems . 
  this is risky and it can be detected and is way more expensive for the nsa than collecting information in bulk . 
  plus , you might be overating the nsa 's abilities here . 
  obviously they failed pretty hard at keeping secrets ( snowden ) and they got linked to several pieces of malware pretty quick before that ( flame and stuxnet ) and there were extremely serious concerns of their involvment in placing backdoors in a cryptographic standard even before snowden ( dual_ec_drbg ) . 
  the chinese get caught for cyberespionage all the time , so it 's not like intrusion attempts wo n't get detected forever . 
   to play devils advocate , how can you know that it 's backdoor free ? 
  do multiple security audits . 
   how can you know that the cryptograpic method has n't been broken ? 
  read some of the snowden leaks . 
  the nsa has admitted they ca n't break popular cryptographic protocols , so that 's why they are going around the encryption by hacking into computers , collecting data at the endpoints ( servers of google , facebook , microsoft , etc. ), 
  and other means . 
   the head of the bundestag 's parliamentary inquiry into nsa activity in germany said in an interview with the morgenmagazin tv programme that he and his colleagues were ** seriously thinking of ditching email completely . 
  ** now that 's just plain dumb . 
  teach your employees , or better yet citizens , on how to use email encryption and invest in open-source backdoor-free software . 
  even better , invest into modern cryptographic protocols that support forward secrecy ( like the one behind textsecure ) . 
  but nope , fuck that , let 's go back to the previous century and type shit on typewriters . 
  idiots . 
  while they are at it , they might want to consider doing the internet over pigeons . 
  it 's a [ legit protocol ] ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149 ) accepted by the ietf and implemented by the [ bergen linux user group ] ( http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/ ) .

  yes , he is undoubtedly the person who won the most . 
  the fat guy managed to acquire his media empire because he took a lot of credit from the bank of the second oligarch .
