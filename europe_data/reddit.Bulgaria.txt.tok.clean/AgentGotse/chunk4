  now that the bank has failed and many of the credit records are `` lost '' ( this is also most likely bullshit that the central bank is making up ) , the fat guy oligarch wo n't have to return the money that he owes . 
  talk about a fucking deal . 
  welcome to balkan politics btw . 
  it 's funny , because incidents like these actually allow the israeli government to continue using the anti-semitism card . 
  these protesters , however , are too fucking dumb to realise that they are actually doing a favour to the israeli government . 
  i guarantee that this will not happen . 
  i can think of 4 at the top of my head right now , but there could be more that i do n't know of . 
  that guy that just got fucked now probably lost his oligarch status though . 
  that bank that failed also has russian ties . 
  10 % of it is owned by vtb capital , which is a russian investment bank , which over the years has invested and ( partly ) owned many important companies in bulgaria in a lot of sectors . 
  they actually offered to buy out vasilev 's share and help out the failing bank . 
  luckily , that was turned down . 
   the problem is that us regular tax payers will pick up the tab . 
  as usual . 
  well , i have n't received any answers to my questions yet . 
  the bank will fail , but there will still be a bailout . 
  the question is , whether parliament will vote in a new law which would allow the central bank to save all deposits ( which they should n't do ) or they will use the existing law and save all deposits up to 100 000 euros . 
   he left the country with 100\u00a0000\u00a0000 euro many people and many political commentators are doubting this . 
  the central bank 's version of the events does n't make much sense . 
  here is some reading on the matter ( in bulgarian ) : http://www.dnevnik.bg/analizi/2014/07/11/2342315_neobratim_institucionalen_sriv/ i also left another comment in this thread talking about how absurd what the central bank is claiming on this `` let 's take several trucks full of cash and leave a receipt for it '' bs . 
   after that they will bail that new bank ( credit agricole ) out with 1.6 billion euro from the government 's reserves . 
  our taxes will go to bail out vasilev 's bank . 
  that bank is being nationalised , so he no longer owns it . 
  that other fat guy oligarch ( delyan peevski ) literally managed to bankrupt one of vasilev 's banks and make the government nationalise his other bank . 
  quite an achievement . 
  now , obviously , tsvetan vasilev is not exactly an angel , but this whole episode only goes to show how corrupt the whole government is . 
  the central bank in this case is most likely lying . 
  nobody believes some of their allegations . 
  basically , they are saying that the majority owner of the bank ( tsvetan vasilev ) , somehow withdraw over 100 million in euros from the bank in ** cash ** . 
  to make matters worse , the central bank says they figured this one out , after he left a ** receipt ** for taking out all that money . 
  yes , i am not making shit up , this is literally what the central bank is claiming . 
  the same guy who is alleged to have destroyed documentation about credis worth 3.5 billion ( which is again debatable as he claims that documentation is in the prosecution and that 's why the auditors could n't find it ) , has actually went out of his way to request a receipt for taking out 100 million euros in cash ( which is of course very illegal and therefore completely pointless ) and apparently the main treasurer of the bank is also extremely fucking dumb that she issued it as well , thereby implicating herself in the crime as well . 
  now , obviously , nobody is so stupid , especially that oligarch . 
  but , wait , it becomes even worse !, 
  the central bank is saying that it was actually a ** third person ** who took all that money ( and requested and left a receipt ) in cash . 
  then , the central bank somehow magically figured out that said third person has transported all that cash to the oligarch who is living in austria ( currently ) . 
  now , obviously , the central bank can not track money once they have been taken out in cash , so they are just making shit up . 
  in addition , the central bank is now requesting a new law to be voted in by parliament , to make it so that they can save all of the money in the bank , and not just the accounts up to 100 000 euros ( which is what the law allows ) . 
  so , no fucking thanks , no new laws should be voted in until the truth about this bs comes out . 
  finally , the attack on this guy 's bank was coming from the media empire that is owned by another oligarch ( delyan peevski ) . 
  that guy has a lot of credit to return to first oligarch 's bank and if the bank actually tanks , then he wo n't have to pay that back . 
  he ( and his party ) also have a lot of influence in the prosecution . 
  confirmed by history . 
  all of the bank crisises in the country happen when the bulgarian socialist party is in power . 
  in 2009 ( stanishev ) no banks failed , but there was so much corruption that the eu stopped the money on almost all european funds . 
  say no to bsp , they are just plain incompetent , massively corrupt and will sell the whole country to russia if the circumstances allow for it . 
  seriously , fuck these communist cunts . 
   do n't make racist , homophobic or otherwise dehumanizing comments . 
  attack ideas , not people . 
  so , by `` racist '' , what exactly is meant ? 
  because , looking over at the mod application threads , i see several posters who have applied for mod positions who accuse others of racism rather frivolously . 
  bulgarian * citizens * being discriminated in the uk -- racism . 
  saying something bad about a certain religion -- racism . 
  even in this thread , [ that guy ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2a2iqd/modpost_a_reminder_of_our_rules_and_guidelines/cisflqi ) ( who is applying for mod ) is saying `` any asertion regading culture is primitive and racist '' . 
  anti-immigration -- racist . 
  do n't like multiculturalism -- you must be a racist . 
  all these have jack shit to do with racism if you ask me , but the thing is everybody is pulling the race card these days all the time , so i do n't even know what to think anymore . 
  so , what are we doing here ? 
  will someone get banned for racism/xenophobia/whatever for saying that bulgarians are more homophobic than germans ( that is a fact supported by statistics by the way ) ? 
  [ oi u chavy cunt ima rek u , i swear on me mum ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2rs8cojv_k&amp;feature=kp ), 
  please , you can always tell us apart because of our glorious tracksuit wearing skills . 
  learn2balkan . 
  what 's the point of that ? 
  if i did n't respect human rights and wanted to stay in sweden , i would just lie about it . 
  there were several german army groups on the north bank of the danube river demanding passage to greece . 
  it was at this point that the country decided to join the axis . 
  the alternative was getting invaded and occupied . 
  because someone is trying to destabilise the local `` bulgarian '' banks . 
  one of the people who is certainly involved is an oligarch delyan peevski . 
  his medias were spreading false rumours with the purpose to bankrupt a specific bank ( which holds huge deposits of government-owned companies involved with the energy sector ) . 
  luckily , the central bank moved in and put that bank under special control and now there is no possibility it will bankrupt . 
  after that , there was a massive campaign by somebody else , which was spreading rumours over sms text message and emails to customers of another bank saying that it is about to fail ( said bank also has decent government-owned deposits ) . 
  nobody knows who is behind the second wave of attacks , but many people ( and political analysts ) suspect the russian government . 
  both peevski and the russian government share a common interest -- the construction of the south stream gas pipeline whose construction was recently cancelled by the government . 
  shortly after that was done , one of the coaltion partners of the government ( dps which is also the party in which peevski is mp ) started withdrawing support for the government and that shit started rolling out . 
  brain drain . 
  for example , there are not enough doctors to work in hospitals now . 
  so what happened with the fucking sanctions against russia ? 
  i just want to also point out that bulgaria stopped work on the project ( after the eu insisted on this and threatened sanctions ) and now we will probably get sued by russia . 
  meanwhile austria strikes a deal . 
  where are the fucking eu sanctions against austria ? 
  another eastern european reporting in . 
  i am not a big fan of the government interfering with the economy willy-nilly . 
  durring communist times the government had almost complete control of the economy and those idiots implemented some completely nonsensical projects that are still a burden to the bulgarian economy to this day . 
  i am ok with interfering when there are obvious problems ( such as monopolies and cartels ) , but not arbitrarily . 
  there should always be a good reason for messing with the economy and you better think twice befre you do so . 
  you can see video footage and more photos from these two websites : http://www.moreto.net/novini.php?n=255282 http://www.dnevnik.bg/morski/2014/06/19/2327115_pone_deset_jertvi_na_poroia_vuv_varna_obnovena_v_0012ch/?ref=breakingnews that 's the worst flood in varna in living memory , possibly ever . 
  i think it is shocking that people who actually have been part of a civilised society can subscribe to the most violent and vile kind of islam and would then join these jihadist cunts who want to violently establish a caliphate which will institutionally enforce it . 
  the bare minimum that needs to be done is to enact laws which prevent citizens from fighting into foreign conflicts . 
  this `` intellectual property crime unit '' is just a corporate police force paid by the british taxpayers to protect the interests of a few bigass entertainment companies . 
  it 's shameful that money is spent on this instead of fighting actual crime . 
  what do the opinion polls currently show ? 
  i am aware . 
  the first time i saw a woman wearing a burka was in germany where i was a undergraduate student . 
  the second time was in the uk where i am ( still ) a graduate student . 
  i stopped counting this as i see women wearing burkas almost daily now here in the uk . 
  and currently , there are clueless people in my country advocating for electronic voting . 
  after reading news like this , it is very easy to see why that would be a horrible mistake -- the results of the electronic part of the vote will be determined by whoever hacks you first ( which will most likely be either china , russia or the united states ) . 
  yeah , when i watched the news videos of people coming out to support them i was shocked . 
  these protesters did exactly the opposite -- people saw that the kind of islam being taught is certainly not traditional to the area ( women wearing burkas and other shit ) .
