  the good news is that most polls show that this party wo n't make it into the next parliament . 
  they lost many voters after the bs they pulled after the elections, 
  he 's referring to france, 
  the previous poster did n't even mention corruption , what are you going on about ? 
  i am looking forward to the nobel laurette 's explanation on this where he will assure me this is just for terrorists and shit . 
  not really . 
  it 's more like `` batka '' . 
  mutri are supposed to be rich and involved in organised crime . 
  that 's the entire point -- nobody cares about your education if you will be working in retail or as a general construction worker etc. 
  experience is what is important . 
  also , i am not british . 
   what if i told you that what you are saying in the first paragraph is exactly `` they took our jobs '' . 
  that does n't mean it 's not hapenning . 
   if an englishman ca n't keep up in experience this is the fault of your education system . 
  i do n't see the connection . 
  there are quite a few jobs that do n't require university level education or even high school level education over the 8th grade . 
  you ca n't expect every single brit to be highly qualified . 
  the brits who are not highly qualified are thus at a disadvantage , especially the younger brits just leaving school , because now they have to compete with immigrants who have previous work experience . 
  i did n't say gerb was n't wiretaping . 
  you should read more carefully . 
  seeing that the budget was now doubled and there are no reforms , i can only conclude that these fuckers will be doing double the amount of wiretaping + 33 % more surveliance from their lapdogs at dans . 
   kokinov reports what he knows about the progress in the corruption case against naydenov . 
  he also reveals what the key witness , svetoslav simeonov , has said and what he plans to say . 
  kokinov offers advice to naydenov on how to avoid prosecution and assuages him the case would not hold water in court . 
  similar to how someone leaked information to biserov , so that he can resign before the accusations . 
   `` kokinov confirms suspicions and media reports about tsatsarov being handpicked by borisov . 
  ( `` do n't smirk , you handpicked him , '' kokinov is heard saying . ), 
  the chief prosecutor is appointed by the president , who is from the same party . 
  nothing surprising here . 
  also , obviously a bad call as far as gerb is concerned , seeing how he is only going after them and not after bsp . 
  that shitshow with the smearing attempt against gerb performed by tv 7 + bsp with the fake ballots ? 
  i do n't see him doing anything about it . 
  police now requiring id cards for no good reason and refusing to identify themselves ( which is illegal ) ? 
  i do n't see him doing anything about it . 
  the prime minister saying he will fire government employees who attend protests ( both illegal and unconsitutional ) ? 
  i do n't see tsatsarov doing anything about it . 
  the `` bullet points '' ( \u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u0438 ) where the police is carrying out political favors for the bsp and against gerb by spreading misinformation , discrediting people and misrepresenting facts and also trying to downplay the protests ( completely illegal ) ? 
  i do n't see tsatsarov doing anything about it . 
  ( the last one is a bigger scandal than peevski + biserov together , it brings us back to the good old days where state security was doing the same kind of shit ) . 
  obviously , bsp + dps are more corrupt . 
  that 's why they lost trust so fast . 
  gerb only lost power because they were unable to handle the energy crisis , that was the main cause of the protests in february . 
  now it 's just corruption and the protests are far bigger and persistent . 
  why are you writing this from a brand new account ? 
  also , seeing that you are anonymous , who are you planning to vote for ? 
  i will probably go for the reformist block . 
  they are corrupt too ( kasim dal for example ) , but what can you do . 
  edit : also , note how there are never any leaks against the communists . 
  in 1997 , ivan kostov was wiretapped and the audio was released . 
  in 1999 in lovech , nadezhda mihailova was recorded and the audio got released ( massive emabrassment , media censorship ) . 
  now this is hapenning against gerb and in particular the prime minister . 
  a question which nobody is asking is -- how the fuck is it possible to wiretap the prime minister in this country without anybody in government having a clue about it ?!, 
  i have listened to all of those recordings . 
  you are just making my points . 
  this was obviously done by the dans , which even the little kids these days know is under the control of the dps . 
  misho birata is a tiny scandal compared to valio toploto , r. 
  ovch. , hristo biserov , peevski , the amnesty law , etc. 
  as for the general wiretaping abuse -- the dps + bsp are obviously also doing it -- they are wiretaping the prime minister and the government ministers using dans ... also , both of these parties were complaining from wiretap abuses and what happened this week ? 
  they ** doubled ** the wiretaping budget . 
  http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2013/11/13/2181436_reformata_na_podslushvaneto_zapochva_s_dvoino/ note , i did n't say that gerb is n't corrupt . 
  i am saying they are less corrupt than bsp + dps . 
  good answer overall . 
  first a disclaimer : i did n't vote for gerb on the last elections -- i voted for a party that did n't enter . 
  i disagree with your assessment that gerb is equally as corrupt as the bsp + dps . 
  bsp + dps are far more corrupt than gerb . 
  i remember perfectly well that an enormous part of the eu funds were frozen during the 2005-2009 government when bsp + dps were in power . 
  funds were frozen because of rampart corruption . 
  when gerb came into power , all eu funds were unfrozen and the money started flowing in again and continue to do so until they stayed in power . 
  now , it was exactly ** yesterday ** when the eu started freezing eu funds again . 
  this government has been in power for like 6 months and they already managed to fuck up some of the eu funds . 
  i am sure more will follow . 
  also , the current government has the lowest approval rating of all time , except for the bsp government in 1997 ( when protesters stormed parliament and kicked them out ) . 
  in just six months in power , their ratings managed to fall below what gerb had when they resigned . 
  \u0422hat 's amazing . 
  no other government has managed to lose trust this fast . 
  i think that is indicative of how much more corrupt the bsp + dps is rather than gerb . 
  also , all of the corruption scandals that i can recall from the current bsp + dps government and the former 2005-2009 dps + bsp government are orders of magnitude worse than what happened during gerb 's time . 
  that said , what i want to see in the next parliament and government is a coalition between gerb + reformist block , because ... there 's nobody else and fuck the bsp + dps , both parties are full with communists and were created by the communist party . 
  i am 99 % sure that when winter comes parliament will be stormed . 
  it will be 1997 all over again . 
  i just hope that these cunts will have the decency to resign rather than resorting to tear gas like in istanbul . 
  i have to agree . 
  the last time the bsp ( bulgarian ~ ~ soliciast ~ ~ communist party ) gave up power was when the protesters stormed the parliament in 1997 . 
  other than that it is pretty pointless to attack the police ( they are just people doing their job after all , they also need to put bread on the table ) . 
  nobody died , but there were some injured people ( both police and protesters ) . 
  storming parliament is needed these days too to be honest . 
  bulgarian history as well . 
  on pictures 3 and 5 you can see this guy : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_of_bulgaria, 
  the only police violence i can see is at 3:18 when one of the police officers punches the guy on the ground . 
  that 's it ... 
  i fully support the protests , but goddamn some of the protesters are just fucking retarded . 
  they insult the policemen all the time . 
  why ? 
  this makes no sense . 
  they obviously have to do their job -- clear the streets so that the mps can leave parliament . 
  i am completely sure that the vast majority of the policeman do n't like what they are doing and many of them did n't vote for the fuckers in power either . 
  there 's no need to insult and attack the police . 
  it 's not like they can choose exactly which mps and politicians to protect ... 
  read the next sentence after the quoted one, 
  many people want the former borisov government back , plus some other right party ( like the reformist block ) .
