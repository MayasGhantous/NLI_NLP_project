  it has nothing to do with the topic . 
  and they went to your part of the world not mine . 
  the term pop-folk is trash . 
  our folk music does n't have anything to do with the orient either . 
  that is why we call the popular trash chalga . 
  yes , but not in the cold war sense . 
  it 's european . 
  france , uk , spain and so on did n't stop being european when they started colonizing the world . 
  in europe there is and always was . 
  and as far as i am concerned , that is the way it should be . 
  japanese cars are filled with old and inexpensive tech , making them cheap and easy to fix . 
  correct me if i am wrong , but are n't most german cars in the states made locally or in mexico ? 
  i think you read that wrong . 
  the first time i looked at the title i was like wtf as well , but i think he simply means what do europeans think of the question `` are we alone in the universe ? 
  those are the meanings of the axis . 
  they simply used different different names . 
  yes , it should have been liberal , instead of libertarian and you might even be right that this is intentional , but you can still use if if you know how it works . 
  you are overthinking it . 
  instead of left/libertarian you can think of the lines as economic/social , most of the questions have the same use in europe as they do in america . 
  its not like being pro tax , pro lgbt and pro workers rights means different things in the states . 
  its not perfect , but it wont put you on the right side if you believe in left wing policies . 
  you do n't represent the left wing commie , stop imposing your shit . 
  just because you are a far left loonie does n't mean other people are right wing . 
  with the exceptions of few subs , reddit is mostly left leaning . 
  lol downvotes . 
  thanks boys , i guess i should give up my leftie card now . 
  i guess i am kicked from the club . 
  stop with the victim complex , its getting pathetic . 
  go ask r/uk , r/france , r/de and so on what they thing about the right wing . 
  reddit 's userbase is mostly well educated , urban , male and left leaning . 
  you do n't deal with extremism by going to the opposite extreme . 
  we do the same . 
  op , you could have included those [ 1 ] ( http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v407/edrico/ideologiescompass.gif ) , [ 2 ] ( https://www.growtopiagame.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=139680&amp;d=1474996204 ) examples so people get general idea of how their result correlates to real life politics . 
  i know they are not perfect but they can be useful . 
  there is also this political spectrum [ quiz ] ( http://www.gotoquiz.com/politics/political-spectrum-quiz.html ) , which is a bit different . 
  other than that , i consider myself a social democrat and [ this ] ( https://www.politicalcompass.org/chart?ec=-4.75&amp;soc=-5.44 ) and [ that ] ( http://www.gotoquiz.com/politics/grid/8x27.gif ) are my results . 
  pretty much centre-left , so i am happy with them . 
  i like history , so my favorite is still medieval style fantasy and specifically the ones which keep the magical elements on the lower end . 
  and no gun bullshit ( fucking fable ) in my fantasy , thank you . 
  as for sci-fi , i prefer cyberpunk and other genres focusing on humanity and earth in a more contained manner . 
  robotics , transhumanism and stuff like that . 
  not a big fan of space operas , alien races , exploration and so on . 
  lmao . 
  does n't happen . 
  crucial . 
  i am not `` proud '' of such things , but putting that aside , [ karakachan ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=karakachan+bear+dog&amp;rlz=1c1avng_bgbg686bg686&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=589&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewi7jqtw69vrahxgk5okhw7sdieq_auibigb#tbm=isch&amp;q=karakachan+dog ) is a pretty cool dog and one of the oldest breeds in europe . 
  they are building one in [ sofia ] ( http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1946461 ), 
  i like some modern buildings but overall not a fan of skyscrapers . 
  probably prague . 
  could not care less about boobs . 
  face is always most important , followed by slim figure and a nice bottom . 
  and where do they get by without speaking english ? 
  nyc ? 
  i very much doubt it . 
  if you are talking about the southern states it comes down to having cities or at least neighbourhoods where the majority of the population speaks spanish as their native language . 
  speaking the native language is not a requirement , but its the only way you will have close relationship with the locals . 
  i would definitely puke from the gelatinous thing . 
  its pretty common on public buildings and hotels . 
  1 ) is a somewhat real issue . 
  while i would n't say that anti-lgbt sentiment is something intrinsic to right-wing politics , you ca n't deny that they are less progressive on that front . 
  2 ) non-issue . 
  there is no chance of making europe more religious and politics cant change that . 
  some countries will still be more devout than others , but the average european will only continue to become less and less religious in the coming time . 
  3 ) same as above , do n't know why you put it as a separate point . 
  4 ) i have no knowledge concerning this story . 
  5 ) more of an american issue ( it does affect everyone , but there is not much to do about that ) . 
  every country in europe seems to push for reforms and investments in alternative sources of energy . 
  there is still a long way to go , especially for the poorer countries , but progress is being made . 
  6 ) stupid is a weak word for dissolving the eu . 
  i do n't think it would happen but there are still many unknowns , most of which should be answered in 2017 . 
  after that we would be able to make a more concise statement on the future of the eu . 
  lmao .

  simply not true . 
  it all depends on the manufacturer . 
  looking at your profile , i wo n't mind if you do disappear . 
  i guess we got that from you , but we pronounce it more like ezi . 
  another poster said he is from paris and that he takes his shoes off inside , that is why i thought it might be up to the region . 
  i would love to know what the people on your sub have to say about it but i just started learning french : /, 
  i do it the same way . 
  from the top , breaking the stem makes it uncomfortable as fuck , i ca n't understand how can people prefer it . 
  there seems to be a lot of conflicting information coming from people with french flags . 
  can it be up to the region ? 
  which part of the country are you from ? 
  which part of france are you from ? 
  or it does n't really matter ? 
  well , thats your problem . 
  stop projecting your issues on other countries , the world is much more complex . 
  what they want is not relevant , they are not the ones making the decision . 
  professionals are paid to follow orders . 
  it needs to happen . 
  quite the opposite , it needs to be 100 % professional so you do n't get people from all over europe saying that they are going to a war against their wish . 
  if you have heard only polish , maybe . 
  and i do n't even think that slavic languages sound amazing . 
  as far as i am concerned the latin ones sound the best , especially french and italian . 
  the level of ignorance is astonishing . 
  to think that 50 years are more important than 2000 so you can group nations the way you like . 
  russia is nothing like you . 
  russia is literally the only country alongside belarus to 100 % fit the term eastern europe . 
  turkey is an asian country with european colonies , russia is european with asian colonies .
