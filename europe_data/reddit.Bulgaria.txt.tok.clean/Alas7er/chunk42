  we make kozunak for easter . 
  we usually eat cake on christmas day but its not specific . 
  on other hand we do have a traditional dessert for christmas eve called [ \u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b2%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%ba&amp;rlz=1c1avng_bgbg686bg686&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewif64i4kdbqahueuhqkhwxhakiq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=589 ) , basically filo pastry with pumpkin . 
  its a part of the odd number of lenten dishes we eat during dinner that day . 
  well we pretty much have the same conservative/commie split around here . 
  i guess at the end you have better representation than me . 
  a social-democrat in a country still ruled by `` former '' communists ca n't do much . 
  a rather interesting position , i can see how its hard for you to fit . 
  even more so in the context of a post-communist state . 
  how do you feel about your political representation in lithuania . 
  i take it you are from the uk or you are just afraid to label yourself as a libertarian ? 
  not that new , we simply do n't care about them , at least in the more `` eastern '' parts . 
  we prefer pure stuff and mixing is usually reserved only for shots . 
  there is also the cultural differences as you mention . 
  in europe alcohol plays a much bigger part of meals , be it wine , beer or even some spirit . 
  we do drink alcohol to get shitfaced but that is only one and much less frequent use of it . 
  i am whiter than a snowflake and ca n't tan at all , i guess i must be irish . 
  in northern bulgaria you barely see any mediterranean types . 
  and that changes their skin color ? 
  like half of population of europe ca n't really use that argument against you given their similar history . 
  what is this cancer . 
  pretty sure the hate you are talking about is the one towards young rich kids going around the world with their parents money . 
  the thing is almost everybody loves to travel , but people cant afford or do n't have the time to do it as often as the `` i love to travel '' people . 
  its bigger than the market for new cars . 
  souls and witcher series . 
  i mean , never say never , but i am not interested in going to the uk . 
  i have n't seen anything that would make me visit moldova either . 
  the cyrillic script . 
  i know americans like to describe people fighting wars as heroes and villains , but in most cases they are neither . 
  they are n't , prolly just a weeb . 
  lol , no chance . 
  a very large one , in no doubt shared by other post-communist states . 
  people on this sub are way too kind to tools like you . 
  bread ( mostly white ) , sirene ( brined cheese ) , kashakval ( yellow cheese ) tomatoes , cucumbers , peppers , eggs , kiselo mlyako ( yogurt ) , cabbage , beans , carrots , onions , pork and chicken . 
  some forest fires , some floods , some earthquakes . 
  very major ones are rare but floods in particular have done a lot of damage in recent years . 
  it 's popular for cold cuts but not really in a way of cooking . 
  well in chat it usually comes after : as you write something so it ends up as , 
  that question seems to be on repeat here . 
  anyway , czechia is on the top of my list . 
  seems like you missed it . 
  maybe its the drugs . 
  english is not your strong suit , is it now ? 
  lmao , pathetic . 
  go back to the basement with your tinfoil hat and continue contemplating humanity 's doom . 
  after all we are living in the worst period of history . 
  the way you talk about economic bubbles shows your deep understanding of capitalist economics . 
  http://www.vox.com/world/2016/10/2/13123980/extreme-poverty-world-bank your ignorance is showing . 
  you are telling me that people in asia are living in the same condition as they did during the 20th century ? 
  it means people from all over the world are getting better living conditions , not just the asian ones and that can only be a good thing . 
  when does the book come out ? 
  i personally would add \u201e \u0422\u044e\u0442\u044e\u043d '' ( tabacco ) by dimitar dimov , to those two . 
  this is where you fail . 
  you do the exact thing you accuse europeans of doing . 
  you act as if countries like germany are 100 % homogeneous . 
  regional identity is strong in many european countries . 
  you can see difference in language , food , customs , architecture and so on just inside one country . 
  so when you say texas is different to oregon you fail to account that bavaria is different compared to saxony . 
  in conclusion , if you say that the us is more diverse than any european country you would be right . 
  it comes naturally with having such vast territory and a population of over 300 million . 
  but if you think it 's more diverse than europe as a whole , you are completely deluded . 
  and you should n't . 
  there are like 3 established rankings and everything else is irrelevant . 
  the main reason for \u0435nglish-speaking dominance comes from citations . 
  sweeter and lighter breakfast is the more common one in most warmer european countries . 
  just because people do n't agree with your dumb drivel , does n't mean that it has something to do with shitamericanssay . 
  why is it so important to you for people to want to go to the us ? 
  why ? 
  is that supposed to be some inferiority complex ? 
  its rather pathetic that you got so mad for people not wanting to move to the us . 
  even in the best and most liberal cities in america like seattle and portland ( which are great cites ) i would still be in a country which will make a choice between hillary clinton and donald trump . 
  the subtle differences between states and cities are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things . 
  if america goes to war in some country you wont say `` buh buh buh its the south 's fault !, 
  people from nyc did n't vote for this . '', 
  canada , specifically quebec . 
  that 's the only place outside of europe pretty much . 
  australia and argentina are nice but too warm for my liking . 
  new zealand is way too far . 
  you really believe the things you wrote ? 
  stop pretending that american interventions are benevolent acts towards world peace . 
  its just sad . 
  i have seen enough of your anti-european drivel to know your real agenda . 
  we do n't import american beers . 
  it 's literally a retarded idea . 
  i dont doubt you have some good `` niche '' or smaller market share stuff , but your big selling brans are shit . 
  importing that here would make it a rather expensive shit . 
  federalisation is the goal to pursue as far as i am concerned , but i dont believe we are close to ready for it . 
  75 % of all maple syrup comes from quebec . 
  not understanding what this subreddit is for . 
  sorry but huntington 's classification was trash at the time when he made it and its even worse when used in current day geopolitics . 
  i mean kazakhstan orthodox ? 
  yea ... 
  what does that even mean ? 
  uninvolved with nato ? 
  there is no nato without the us . 
  there are people who want to be done with nato and focus on european alternative ( i am one of those ) and people who are very much pro-nato . 
  east and west slavs could not look more apart from mediterranean people . 
  you really can not mistake poles and russians for italians . 
  paler on average and fair hair is far more common .
