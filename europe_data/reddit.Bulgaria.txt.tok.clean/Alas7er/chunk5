  we are not talking about qulity but popularity . 
  i do n't like guetta . 
  i love justice , kavinsky and currently big on jabberwocky . 
  as i said in another comment , the yellow is for people who do n't want/care to answer , so we agree on that . 
  the misconception about the yellow bar comes to `` i do n't know '' as in `` i do n't know how to answer '' and not `` i do n't know if god exist '' . 
  people in this thread started talking about a/gnosticism and its completely useless . 
  saying you are agnostic just means you do not know , which should be the default predisposition since we are currently unable to prove or disprove the existence of deities . 
  as people are asked if they `` believe '' or not , gnosticism has no place in the discussion . 
  i feel that people started to use agnosticism in general as a defense in a similar way as the current `` not all ____ ! '', 
  to make their statement less `` sharp ? 
  '' ( i cant think of the right word ) . 
  edit : looking at it now i guess it was wrong for people to downvote you as the guy you answered to was the one to conflict the `` i do n't know answer '' in first place . 
  its more to do with a completely wrong map and your bias than anything else . 
  i mean daft punk / david guetta in france and scorpions in germany are pretty obvious . 
  the french are pretty much leaders in electronic/house and the dutch are by far number one in techno . 
  well i would n't have been surprised if it was him . 
  no way its anelia tho . 
  just call everyone outside of the grey bracket irreligious . 
  interesting , i expected russia to be less religious . 
  it means , i do n't care/want to answer . 
  the questions are not about knowledge but belief . 
  agnostic people can fit in any bracket since the question is about belief , not knowledge . 
  people who believe in a spirit or life force are not theists . 
  i mean its in the name ... 
  nope . 
  every single answer apart from not knowing includes `` i believe '' , not `` i know '' . 
  orange fits perfectly actually . 
  agnosticism 's only claim is that we do n't know and we might never know if something else exists . 
  as such there is no reason to act as if it does exist . 
  in other words an agnostic atheist does n't believe in god but does n't claim to know that god does not in fact exists . 
  that is why you should watch the grey bracket . 
  it is a better representation of religiosity . 
  what is the value with people who believe in god . 
  ye , i guess its with descent . 
  my main point is that germany has been for the most part the go to country for poles . 
  the lower percentage of `` i believe there is no god '' are overall more important than the big results of convinced atheists . 
  so i guess we are in the top 10 of least religious and first/or second in the balkans , depending on how you view slovenia . 
  yes , i guess that is the main differance . 
  the demographics [ page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany ) for germany shows similar number to this pie chart but it also explains the fact that the value does not include foreigners with german nationality and foreign nationals without permanent resident status, 
  except for the fact that it is linked to german [ source ] ( https://www.destatis.de/de/publikationen/thematisch/bevoelkerung/migrationintegration/auslaendbevoelkerung2010200117004.pdf?__blob=publicationfile ) which unfortunately i can not read . 
  looking at the demographic [ page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany ) of germany , the number is pretty much the same as the one from bloomberg ( ~ 670k ) but with the explanation that it does not include foreigners with german nationality and foreign nationals without permanent resident status . 
  i saw the pie chart but i do n't see any details about the time frame or anything else . 
  i guess it might include only poles born in poland which moved to another country but that does ' t really give a clear picture of the favorite destination for poles . 
  i am talking [ overall ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poles ) , not just last year . 
  there are like 3 mil poles in germany and not even 1 mil in the uk . 
  thanks !, 
  i really like the sport but we do n't have any relevant coverage of club leagues in here and i can keep up with it only during the olympics . 
  i mean isnt germany the top destination for poles , per capita ? 
  oh yea i noticed now . 
  are the olympics more important than the [ ice hockey world championship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice_hockey_world_championships ) ? 
  so the olympics are more important than the world cup in hockey ? 
  i watch it from time to time but i do n't know the details . 
  we mostly do n't actually . 
  i am willing to bet more european countries think of the ice variety when they hear hockey . 
  my county for example is not invested in either so i do n't think we have e particular bias . 
  no way anelia is first . 
  i doubt she is top 10 ... 
  the glorious third world enrichment . 
  1 mill per year for how long ? 
  what is the moment when you stop , because humanitarian problems are not going away anytime soon . 
  the only way to help is to invest in poorer regions and make them better for the natives . 
  idk about their biscuits , mby they are decent . 
  my experience is only with the small purple [ sweets ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=hershey+purple&amp;rlz=1c1avng_bgbg686bg686&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjfjpjompfpahwbcrqkhegqc3cq_auibigb ) which they call `` dark '' chocolate ( not sure if they even use the word chocolate but that is what it imitates ) . 
  those are really bad . 
  sorry man but hershey is shit . 
  at least the small purple kisses or whatever their name is . 
  i have not tried reese 's but people seem to be rather positive about them . 
  that is not what i am talking about . 
  i am talking about large scale resettlement to an extent where the majority of the population is of european descent . 
  as is the case with usa , canada , australia , argentina , uruguay and so on , as opposed to colonies which were exploited for resources like india . 
  i am . 
  would you explain it for a simple person as me with your great intellectual might ? 
  i do n't think that europe is less competitive . 
  it simply comes down to other nations getting their shit together . 
  its only normal that countries like china with such vast population and land are becoming global powerhouses . 
  i guess you misunderstood me a bit since you compare belize and honduras . 
  i do not claim that the spanish were great colonizers . 
  the only thing i say is that most former spanish colonies are better countries today , compared to the french ones . 
  if chile for example was a french colony with heavy european settlement , it might be much better than argentina . 
  we can not know . 
  the fact is that french colonies are mostly in africa and mostly `` uneuropean '' unlike the spanish ones which retain their colonial foundation . 
  i also apologize for being somewhat rude as parts of my comments were unwarranted . 
  the big problem with your idea is the lack of counties with comparable size and location which were colonized by different nations . 
  there are no relevant countries that were colonized by the french and spanish which are in close proximity and of comparable size . 
  equatorial guinea is too small to be compared to its neighbours , so i guess the only thing that is close to fitting your criteria is haiti - dominican republic but in that case you can say that both were under spain in france in different periods . 
  so i would like to know which french and spanish colonies are comparable by your criteria . 
  the only thing that is obvious is that the `` most european '' colonies are the most prosperous and powerful ones today . 
  wtf are you even talking about ? 
  do you really give an example of an island of 10 000 as some success story ? 
  i thought you finns are supposed to have excellent mastery of the english language , yet you ca n't make a concise sentence . 
   where is africa again ? 
  and chile/mexico/columbia are in africa , right ? 
  ( giggle ... ) what is this shit supposed to mean ? 
  are you claiming that the only reason africa is shit is the geography ? 
  is that your point ? 
  your original comment said that french colonies are better than spanish ones and yet i do n't see you proving that . 
  i guess you did n't know about that little thing , what do you call it ? 
  ah , the industrial revolution . 
  they had that share when the world economy was all about agriculture , textile and stuff like that . 
  huge population and a lot a of land usually resulted in big gdp but with the technological advancement those sectors became less and less relevant .
