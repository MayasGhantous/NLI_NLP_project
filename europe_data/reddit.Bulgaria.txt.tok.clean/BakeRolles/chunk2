  it is related the name of our currency originates from '' \u043b\u0435\u0432\u044a '' an old form of '' \u043b\u044a\u0432 '' ( lion ), 
  expected chinese to be 2nd with about 30 % . just had my mind blown away, 
  same here, 
  europe is already too much dependent on [ russia for gas ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russia_in_the_european_energy_sector#natural_gas_deliveries ) . the south stream would only make it even more so.not only that , but there is [ another proposed natural gas pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nabucco_pipeline ) which will decrease the russian gas dependence . 
  i think this is for the best ( regarding recent events ), 
  despite their religion they are n't really arabic as well.turkey is more like a link between the balkans and the near east, 
  no kazakhstan recognized [ the republic of crimea ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_crimea ) as a proclaimed republic and federal subject of russia . 
  from what i know the president of kazakhstan has close ties with putin, 
  one third of the active personnel.there are 2 million reserve personnel, 
  from what i know there are 220.000 ~ ~ russian ~ ~ unindetified troops in crimea preaty sure some of them have voted, 
  angela merkel she will be a dream president of bulgaria, 
  it 's because christian countries own the big news companies . 
  then again no one is surprised that serbians will back russians . 
  dinosaurs obviously . 
  do a bulgarian one please , 
  hahah you made my day, 
  you did n't need one [ last time ] ( http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/028/8/9/ww2_era_german_march_gif_by_tiepilot789-d4ny7r0.gif ) :d, 
  from what i know crimeans do n't like russians and would rather be a part of ukraine than russia, 
  almost all of eu countries put a limit on refugees.and take in only 500-2000 people , such countries have their limit reached months ago, 
  how do turkish people view bulgarians ? 
  not a big difference in [ bulgaria ] ( http://vbox7.com/play:15cb1e4c50 ), 
  [ because kosovo is not even seen as a country by about 45 % of countries ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aiveqmfppk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=45s ), 
  kosovo is probably the last country from the balkans to join the eu if it even joins, 
  til,

  even in bulgarian we have '' \u0415\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 '' ( evala ) it comes from ev allah , or something like that . 
  basically it means good job . 
  - hey i just unclogged the toilet . 
  - evala . 
   it would make our old commie nostalgic farts commit suicide . 
  nah , i 'm pretty sure they are build to last . 
  just like things were back in the day , unlike the shit today . 
  democracy my ass !, 
  we had industry and agriculture hurr durr \\* votes bsp every day \\*, 
  damn , that hit close to home . 
   cyrilic was invented by ... well cyril . 
  a roman christian priest that lived ... well after the birth of jesus . 
  cyril and his brother methodius invented the glagolic alphabet ( based on the greek one ) , not the cyrilic one . 
  also they were byzantines and not romans ( even though byzantine is a modern day term , and byzantines would reffer to themselfs as romans , there is a diffrence ) . 
  the cyrillic alphabet was created in the capital of the first bulgarian empire , based on the greek and glagolic alphabets . 
  it was named after cyril and methodius out of respect for their contribution to the slavic people . 
  from my observations turks tend to have a clean shave , until they reach the age of 40 . 
  then they pop the classical '' [ full mustache ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5288/5324859975_eeec5295f8_b.jpg ) '' .

   give her the d the deutsche sprache ? 
  - dimitry where are my glasses ?? 
  - shit artyom i told you to get them from the table !, 
  it should be noted that cska fans are extra pissy lately , as what used to be the best club in bulgaria is now playing in the `` v group '' the third ( lowest ) level of the league . 
  why have high speed rail , when you can go 180 km/h on any road ? 
  a happy bloke . 
  health , friends and family , money , girls , commiting genocides in neighboring countries . 
  preaty basic stuff . 
  little known fact , back in 1885 [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bag1guxuu0g ) was recommended as the bulgarian anthem , but was rejected as it `` did n't have enough trumpets '' . 
  we have a higher death rate than afghanistan . 
  yay,

  [ it 's super effective ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iiectxh.png ) !, 
  most people choose geography i have n't looked up any statistics , just most people from my school ( just graduated ) and other schools from my city chose psychology . 
  psychology is seen as the go to exam for people do n't really care and just want to pass it . 
  also forgot about the second language ones , the english one is easy as fuck . 
  however because i did n't study english through high school i was unable to choose it ( top logic there )  maths has less items , but they could go overboard with the difficulty . 
  - oh the math exam was easy !, 
  - said one of the invigilators during my specialty exam from my highschool . 
  - replied i - i just hope it 's not a 2 ( lowest grade/equivalent of an f ) - what ? 
  my student ( the guy who she gave private lessons to ) just called and said he got a 5.60 ( basically an a ) ( the results of the matura came out in the same day , while i was taking the exam , 30 minutes prior to our conversation ) - since when did you start giving him lessons ? 
  - oh well since the start of 12 grade . 
  i just sat there thinking : bitch if i had that much money i wo n't be in school . 
  any way got a 3.11 on the math exam , live to tell a tale . 
  in bulgaria you have 2 exams : the first one is always '' bulgarian language and literature '' . 
  the second one you get to choose the subject ( math , psychology , georaphy etc. ) . 
  most people choose '' psychology and logic '' as it is seen as the easyest . 
  thats old . 
  [ this is the shit now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpl2dpcfvbw ) . 
  a bulgarian turk singing a chalga song in bulgarian , with the hook beeng in gypsy ( romani ) , and the video taking place in greece . 
  does n't get any more balkanic then that . 
  shooty mcshooty sleep sleep ? 
  even more albanians in nato - serbia 's nightmare . 
  no life . 
  only misery and traksuit . 
  such is life in balkan . 
  ha , joke 's on you .
