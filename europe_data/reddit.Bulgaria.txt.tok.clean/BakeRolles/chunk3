  cyril and methodius created the [ glagolitic alphabet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_alphabet ) , not the [ cyrillic alphabet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyrillic_script ) . 
  the cyrillic alphabet was named after cyril and methodius out of respect to their contributions to slavs and christians . 
  and not because they were the creators . 
   the cyrillic alphabet was created in thessaloniki what ? 
  [ from wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cyrillic_script )  the early cyrillic , which was developed in the first bulgarian empire during the 9th century ad at the preslav literary school .

  it 's uhm ... \u0434\u0430 ( da ) ... '' \u0434\u0430 '' means '' yes '' in russian . 
  he 's actually the president of chechnya , and the son of a previous president who launched a jihad against russia .

  it should be noted that he is the first and only president of kazakhstan from 16 december 1991 to this day ( he just won his fifth term ) . 
  and before that he was the prime minister of the kazakh ssr from 1984 to 1989 . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 'll die a president .

  ironically the armenian genocide started as battles and massacres between armenians/turks and armenians/kurds . 
  one of the first genocidal elements is actually talaat pasha , the then head of state of the ottoman empire , deporting the armenians from western armenia ( modern day eastern turkey ) to the syrian desert , which was latter in history defined as a death march .

  a question to non-bulgarians : do you guys '' wrestle '' eggs ( one person holds an egg upright and another person hits the egg with another egg ( with the up side pointing down ) , and then you flip the eggs end the person who hold the egg is now the one who hits ) it 's pretty hard to explain [ here is a picture ] ( http://gotvach.bg/files/lib/600x350/chukane-qica.jpg ) for reference .

  i do care about literature and enjoy it . 
  however it 's waaaay more enjoyable when you choose to read it rather than being forced to read it just bec\u0430use its in your school curriculum . 
  seriously the most depressing one [ atanas dalchev ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atanas_dalchev ) has a poem called '' the books '' where he explains how he wasted countless days and nights reading about other peoples lives , and how his own life will pass without being useful to anyone . 
  the last verse is literally this ( translated from bulgarian ) : to me you never reached , oh , call of love , and i have lost cus ' of the books the life and the world . 
  and you just sit in class , while being given homework : read some more shit , thinking : well is n't this ironic . 
  ohhh man mine is in a month and a half and i 'm basically dicking around . 
  i 'm more worried about math tho . 
  for us it in order : pre-bulgarian state literature ( remove ottoman you are worst smell !, 
  fear not brothers for we shall removing evil turk animal and motherland shall be free from yatagan ! ), 
  which is actually quite good , then you have ok literature , then depressing literature , then literature written by socialists , then literature that was written by people who ended up being killed by the socialists aaaand that 's pretty much it . 
  it was supposed to be seen as play on words `` no mercy '' with `` merci '' also being the french word for `` thanks '' . 
  it 's a pretty georgian thing , at least in the cities .
