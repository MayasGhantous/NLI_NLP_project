  wolves can not hold a candle to it . 
   you are presenting your points , specifically the transition from 3 to 4 , as if there are no alternatives . 
  there are , in fact . 
  this means you do not agree already with point 1 : `` historically and psychologically it is proven that you can make a large group of people to do/not do something in 3 ways - fire up their enthusiasm , or make it ( near ) impossible , or force them by fear or violence '' let 's address that : what other ways are there to make a large group of people to do/not do something ? 
  i will , if i may ... 
  i set the argument point by point , please rebut on th epoints that you dont agree 1 . 
  historically and psychologically it is proven that you can make a large group of people to do/not do something in 3 ways - fire up their enthusiasm , or make it ( near ) impossible , or force them by fear or violence . 
  do you agree so far ? 
  here you can not fire any enthusiasm to anybody not to come - these people are far , scattered , do n't care to listen to you , probably do n't understand you and most importantly are fired up to come to you . 
  do you agree so far ? 
  3 . make it impossible to come - with greek geography and turkey on the other side - this is out of the question . 
  you cant build a new chinese wall over the sea . 
  do you agree ? 
  what is left , logically , is fear and force . 
  do you agree ? 
  now , this is the difficult part for a greek . 
  you need to sacrifice a piece of your beautiful , tourist cash producing land . 
  the islands that are flooded by migrants already need to be sacrificed . 
  you move all migrants to refugee camps on these islands . 
  if they do n't cooperate use the army . 
  be brutal if needed . 
  once in the camps , tell un that there is humanitarian crisis going on and they better bring food , water and tents . 
  jam pack the camps and start applying the eu law meticulously - register , fingerprint , process refugee applications . 
  do n't let anybody move out of the island . 
  give means for them to go back to turkey if they wish ( inflatable boats ) . 
  do you agree ? 
  the alternative is that the whole greece becomes a refugee camp and the whole tourist industry collapses . 
  so it is either point 5 or greece is finished . 
  do you agree ? 
  you may think point 5 is not realistic . 
  it is . 
  it is just a military logistical operation that was done many times in the history . 
  [ reading original article advised ], 
   `` european leaders are pushing to develop the industry 's moral compass . '', 
  this is where they lost me - first line below the title . 
  free market eats ethics for breakfast . 
  especially if it is sitting beyond the big water . 
  you get downvoted for no reason . 
  it will save a massive amount of bureaucracy . 
  according to the proposal that you are going to reject - can you take the money and move to live elsewhere ? 
  let 's restate the obvious until eu is completely in ruins . 
  then we can start the blaming . 
  that is not that hard . 
  just move all fleets there , launch some drones with infrared cameras and start arresting smugglers . 
  once you get 20 and sentence them for max sentence , the rest will back down . 
  i am sure this is much cheaper than 3 billion euros that turkey now upped to 5 and want them in bulk ... 
  now i have to go to talin !, 
  not really . 
  life has thought me that the power hungry idiots would not mind putting the world in ruins , including their own country , if they could make some profit and/or stay in power . 
  but how do you know what will he be doing - terrorism , tourism , nudism , etc if you do not stop him at the border to check and verify ?!, 
  mind reading ?!, 
  individual tracking by drones ?!, 
  using spy satellites form a james bond movie ?!, 
  tell me , tell me , i am dying form the suspense !, 
  what if the power-having palestinians just sabotage the talks just to get recognition and not get peace ? 
  back then the law was the law . 
  just or not - it was . 
  what you suggest is to scrap all laws and use own moral compass . 
  that gon na work out great !, 
  there was even a word for that ... escaped my mind ... 
  so if the petry asked the law to be followed , and the german vice chancellor finds this wrong ... seems the german vice chancellor is inciting law disobedience . 
  will this be tolerated ? 
  it is not only food . 
  washing powder is also very different and way crappier in the east . 
  the math : 660 items so far . 
  over 24 years . 
  about one myth per forthnight . 
  well , eurostat shows a curious picture - [ romania and bulgaria are , and have been , worse off for decades already ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=bookmark_ds-127829_qid_-71e33b61_uid_-3f171eb0&amp;layout=age,l,x,0;geo,l,y,0;unit,l,z,0;sex,l,z,1;time,c,z,2;indicators,c,z,3;&amp;zselection=ds-127829unit,pc_pop;ds-127829sex,t;ds-127829time,2014;ds-127829indicators,obs_flag;&amp;rankname1=time_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname2=unit_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname3=indicators_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname4=sex_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankname5=age_1_2_0_0&amp;rankname6=geo_1_2_0_1&amp;ppcrk=first&amp;ppcso=protocol&amp;sortc=asc_-1_first&amp;rstp=&amp;cstp=&amp;rdch=&amp;cdch=&amp;rdm=true&amp;cdm=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=rolling&amp;time_most_recent=true&amp;lang=en&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2c%23%23%23.%23%23%23&amp;lang=en ) . 
  and nobody gave crap about that . 
  i will not be totally shocked if it would create the opposite effect . 
  well , that 's ... creative ... 
  so , give me an estimate : how long would it take to see every single place in this album using local transportation ? 
  what is the average price to live for a day in gerogia for a tourist , if i take low-middle class hotels . 
  btw , the next time someone says switzerland has beautiful mountains , i will tell them georgia just lol-ed . 
  a-m-a-z-i-n-g !, 
  if you set things right and straight , millions will not come . 
  that 's the whole point, 
  because turkey has the obligation to stop people without proper authorization/papers/permission to enter other countries . 
  well , if you want to get so anal-ytical then be aware that :  in some jurisdictions , the offence of blackmail is often carried out during the act of robbery . 
  this occurs when an offender makes a threat of immediate violence towards someone in order to make a gain as part of a theft . 
  for example , the threat of `` your money , or your life ! '', 
  is an unlawful threat of violence in order to gain property . 
  blackmail is not only about revealing a secret . 
  not a greek , but here is what needs to happen , and eventually will : greece needs to sacrifice a piece of their beautiful , tourist cash producing land . 
  the islands that are flooded by migrants already anyway need to be written off . 
  the billions you give to turkey can be used to compensate the locals and move them elsewhere . 
  then move all migrants to refugee camps on these islands . 
  if they do n't cooperate use the army . 
  be brutal if needed . 
  once in the camps , tell un that there is humanitarian crisis going on and they better bring food , water and tents . 
  use the billions for turkey to set up the camps . 
  start applying the eu law meticulously - register , fingerprint , process refugee applications , grant asylum to the proven refugees , sent back the rest to turkey or offer them to stay in places with no access to free movement in mainland eu . 
  do n't let anybody move out of the island . 
  give means for them to go back to turkey if they wish ( inflatable boats ) . 
  this will be needed for the next 100 years to cope also with the climate migrants . 
  and i got down voted on this before , because `` but the locals love their land , but the human rights , but you nazi '' .
