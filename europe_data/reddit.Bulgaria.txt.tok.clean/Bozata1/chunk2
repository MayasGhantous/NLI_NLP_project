  this is what is needed because the world will become a much nastier place and if you do n't do it eu will be destroyed - by the economic migrants , by the aggressive cultural and religious invasion , by the climate shifts . 
  btw , italy needs to do the same . 
  you may think this is not realistic . 
  it is . 
  it is just a military logistical operation that was done many times in the history . 
  all you need is to tell the world : we have laws and we will apply them fully . 
  also , this is what we offer and if you do n't like it , or the perceived threat on you is smaller than the reality in our refugee camps , dont come . 
  it is really very simple . 
  you just need the political will to do it . 
  well the formula `` if you do n't do what i want , then i will do something bad to you '' is the definition of blackmail . 
  in this case , with your words :  if they do n't receive the money , they will let them through, 
  and this competes the elevator pitch about the societies of the world ... 
  maybe they will ask them to go to the burkini islands to bathe ... 
  in the same article by the same official :  `` given britain 's size , significance and its long membership of the european union , there will probably be a special status which only bears limited comparison to that of countries that have never belonged to the european union , ''  `` there can not be any cherry picking . '', 
  so `` special status '' is what ? 
  a yearly pat on the back in form of inviting a uk secretary to the opening of the eu parliament season ? 
   `` sooner or later the us will make a choice . 
  either turkey or feto , '' erdogan said ... forgetting the 3rd option `` turkey with no erdogan whatsoever '' . 
  i think usa will go for that one ... 
  for the ** duration ** of the first balkan war there could be no shadow of a doubt . 
  bulgaria was ** the badass asskicker ** . 
  later is for later ... 
  well , in the first balkan war we were ** the powerhouse ** . 
  as for the bulgarian war of independence ... we joined some good fights but purely mathematically we had nothing as forces in the war . 
  well , one could claim that bulgarian army lost very few battles ( even was 40km from constantinople ) , while the bulgarian diplomacy lost many wars ... 
  so just do n't let borisov and co anywhere near a negotiation and everything will be alright . 
  it is time comrade erdogan to be invited for a tea ... 
  in a way that he can not refuse . 
  the tea condiments will remain classified for the next 50 years . 
  the business has more customers , grows , need more workers , pays more taxes ... all these effects were never put black and white on the table . 
  i can see that . 
  what the brexiters do not understand is that the uk ** government ** gives to eu , but eu gives back to the ** business ** of uk . 
  it 's like your parents buying you a ticket to disneyland and then you spend a full day inside . 
  yes , they have spent the money , but you get a lot of great fun for that . 
  let me guess - this is that the frequency of atypical fart ? 
  so , you will trigger a50 ... tomorrow ? 
  please , try to do it before tea time . 
  this is right there to stalin examples of `` proof '' . 
  a cook in a canteen was sentenced to 10 year gulag for writing on the menu `` sou [ p of the day : lazy soup '' . 
  he was mocking the working class . 
  you are hired !, 
   university degree in cs they mean cs : go , right ? 
  right ? 
  oh , thank you , thank you !, 
  its brilliant !, 
  hundreds of years ago . 
  and the reforms were forced by the emerging knowledge about humans , life and values . 
  all this knowledge is very readily available to all humans these days ... 
  they can hire , but will they find any/enough ? 
  i doubt here are 400 + highly skilled trade negotiators idling around the world ... 
  true , but these things get blended . 
  one could say isil is looking towards a political goal ( establish a state ) by using religion as motivator ... 
   `` in almost every religion there is always a small group of fundamentalists . 
  we have them too , '' he said . 
  so when was the last catholic bombing of an airport in sa ? 
  sure , there were the ira . 
  and they were bloody crazy . 
  but still they did not go on another continent to bomb muslims . 
  maybe the were thought agile stuff ... like `` if you touch it , you have to improve it '' . 
  and it is not their fault . 
  if they had the daily standups , they would n't have to find out only in the retro that they are fucking it up . 
  ... because i will be killing them anyway via the coup suits . 
  ignore the form for a moment . 
  look at the content . 
  in netherlands polish living on welfare are less than the natives . 
  https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2015/31/zeven-van-de-tien-somaliers-in-de-bijstand also look at all the non-eus ... 
  this is the problem . 
  [ the case in uk is very similar , but of course not so transparent , because it breaks the rhetoric . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/datablog/2015/nov/10/eu-migrants-on-benefits-separating-the-statistics-from-the-spin ) [ i really cant see the argument that the top of all problems for uk are the eu migrants . 
  ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11255425/how-much-do-immigrants-really-claim-in-benefits.html ) no matter how much the idiots make videos with anecdotal cases . 
  this is so much beyond ridiculous i cant even . 
  it took them 23 days , 9 hours and 15 min flight time to cover the 42,840 km . 
  average speed of 76.3 km/h . 
  it 's a clever move . 
  he will arrest and maybe kill most of the visible/known opposition . 
  those who are even slightly involved or worried about being associated will leave so the country will be totally opposition free . 
  how nicely put !, 
  really ?!, 
  tell me how crazy the whole story we have now would have been , if i have told it 2 months ago ? 
   user name checks * out * ftfy, 
  if you are more important than all of eu , then you deserve to make your own union and give the extremely special deal you deserve . 
  i hope you can convince scotland to stay , northern ireland - too . 
  i even have proposal for the name - suk . 
  semi-united kingdom . 
  absolutely . 
  you can have the special deal that every other country has with eu . 
  alternatively , you can enjoy the very un-special deal of the wto . 
  and the right answer is ... ? 
  for me that break was fine . 
  we were new members joining an advanced club and there were strings attached . 
  fine . 
  but doing that now ?!, 
  no way i will accept that . 
  ( as if anybody would ask me ... ), 
   autofocus * in action ... * corrected autofuckup, 
  nice try but no cigar . 
  you did use the break for bulgaria and romania . 
  and rightfully so . 
  equality and all that shit . 
  i did .
