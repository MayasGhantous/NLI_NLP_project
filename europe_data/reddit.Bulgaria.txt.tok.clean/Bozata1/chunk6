  who is laughing now !, 
  uk ** will ** `` contribute '' and ** will ** accept free movement of people . 
  anything else is never going to happen . 
  as for immigration outside eu - they can do whatever . 
  fair points , but netherlands is depending massively on trade . 
  they will be dead in the water if they have to exit eu and renegotiate trade deals . 
  business will not allow the exit . 
  they ignored the referendum on ukraine and will ignore any other the same ... 
   long before then , however , there is a decent chance that we will see another country -- probably the netherlands -- try to make a run for it . 
  aaaaand you lost me there . 
  this is not going to happen, 
  or they could be coming from poorer countries , like bulgaria , where the average salary is way below 1000 euros ... 
   if we ca n't make our own free trade deals of course you can do your own deals . 
  nobody will stop you . 
  the slight inconvenience is that you do n't have enough competence to do that at this very moment . 
  in another news it was pointed out that you have about 20 negotiators . 
  they will be probably locked with eu on the leave . 
  in the mean time you will lose 50 trade deals . 
  with time you could eventually deal with 2-3 parallel negotiations . 
  so in 20-30 years you will have the trade deals you have now through eu . 
  i hope you can survive by then without too much humanitarian help . 
  hmm ... according to me now there is only one thing important - the race against time regarding the uncertainty . 
  uk is damaged goods and eu does n't have any moral responsibility to fix that . 
  eu now cares to save the economy by calming the markets . 
  and i fully support them in doing whatever it takes to force uk into compliancy . 
  even if they have to pull some legal mumbo-jumbo on article 7 and use it . 
  i really think uk had the moral obligation to trigger article 50 the day after the referendum . 
  delaying it now is extremely selfish and borders with blackmail . 
  i do n't care if they had a plan , if they need an election or whatever . 
  450 million are more important than uk . 
  plus , we can not negotiate with blackmailers . 
  he was something like  who is laughing now , ah ?! ... 
  [ 20 sec later ] ... lets be reasonable and act like grownups ... [ 20s sec later ] ... none of you have done a decent day 's work or created a single job !, 
  yep , fantastic example on how to behave reasonable and as a grownup . 
  it looks like some sandwich method for teaching grownup-ship . 
  naah . 
  this was all before the nuclear fallout that is heading towards uk . 
  wait couple of months , or maybe couple of years , and try again asking people if they want their country and future to be nuked . 
  no country will dare to ask her economy to be decimated overnight . 
  there is only one tsunami and it is the economic devastation heading towards uk . 
  the first small ripples have already hit the shore . 
  these are very firm and determined statements . 
  eu just cocked the revolver and slammed the barrel between the eyes of uk . 
  of course not . 
  otherwise we will be having article 7 , not 50 . 
  please . 
  wtf is this for . 
  uk is out and that 's that . 
  otherwise we risk to have a petition for 122th referendum in a decade or so , while staying in limbo . 
  uk must leave asap . 
  tonight will not be too soon . 
  nigel : `` let 's be sensible grownups ... none of you have done a single day of proper work or created a job '' someone usher the toddler with the tantrum out . 
  war !? 
  irish are the canadians of europe . 
  oh , i love british humour !, 
  and it was started by iceland , right ? 
  and the petition should be started by iceland , right ? 
  well , you got at least 926 karma so far from this comment only ... 
   but if they stay , remember that the negotations from february are cancelled . 
  i know this is the case , but i could not find a good source . 
  do you have one , please ? 
  but practically they crashed the confidence in uk and eu . 
  plus they depleted the thrust with everybody . 
  so there will be consequences . 
  uk ca n't pretend nothing happened . 
  is uk trying to trigger article 2 ? 
   the british public 's concerns about immigration needed to be addressed , the majority of the british public proved to be delusional , misinformed and gullible . 
  so , it is up to uk to educate them and not eu to appease their xenophobic hysteria . 
   `` before setting the clock ticking , we need to negotiate a deal and put it to the british people , you should have done that before this referendum . 
  now , please set the clock and then try to negotiate whatever you want . 
  we are not going to wait for you to blackmail us with the clock now . 
  fuck you , asshole . 
  ohh , i though it was `` referendums will continue , until morale improves ! '', 
  pssst keep quiet !, 
  and nobody will notice !, 
  or a time traveller ? 
  or he is living somewhere before the world wars with `` hey , we rule 25 % of the earth - we can demand anything ! '', 
  for me personally , it is like that . 
  but i am nobody , so do n't mind my opinion . 
  well , dow is down with 6 % since brexit ... 
  yep . 
  i believe the future of europe is a federal organizaiton a la usa . 
  uk has no place in it . 
  it is the perfect moment to kick them out for good . 
  or until they are so desperate that they fall in line like italy , spain , romaia and other nations that would have better economies at that point . 
  i am more worried about the collapse of eu stock exchange indexes - 7 % -10 % in a day and still holding . 
  hundreds of millions people have their pensions in stocks and shares . 
  uk just fucked up the world economy . 
  and this has to have some consequences for the uk too . 
  and better be so devastating that no one else thinks to do the same . 
   cameron should be hung . 
  not before the 17.4 million that actually voted for brexit . 
   what he should have did though was push harder for a better deal with the eu prior to the referendum . 
  hell no !, 
  uk had unfairly good deal it did not deserve . 
  from that point it is good that they voted themselves out of it into somethgn between norway and ukraine !, 
  we need a special episode of `` yes , prime minister ! '' . 
  like , really , really bad ... 
  in other news :  barclays and the royal bank of scotland , the 2nd and 3rd largest banks from the uk , have suspended their shares from trading after an 8 % drop on monday . 
  barclays shares are now 26 % below their closing price on thursday , while rbs has tanked by 30 % yeah , why do n't you go ahead and shut the fuck up ...
