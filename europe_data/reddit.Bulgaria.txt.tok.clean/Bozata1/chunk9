  not only that , but i guarantee that form the 27 countries and [ 38 parliaments ] ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/21/eus-national-regional-parliaments-get-brexit-deal-veto/ ) , at least few will think that destroying uk is the most important thing and will work actively to give uk the worst possible deal . 
  why would they think uk destruction is priority # 1 ? 
  few reasons : - if brexit is a success story , other countries will leave too . 
  - historic grudge with uk and now is time to have revenge . 
  - if uk collapses , they could take their place in some markets . 
  - to take revenge for recent arrogance/stuff uk showed/did . 
  - to serve some internal political agenda , flexing muscles , going for a blackmail to get more form uk post-brexit . 
  i am almost certain that uk will be crushed at the end of the exit negotiations . 
  it takes just one of the 38 parliaments to say `` fu '' and the deal is gone , the 2-year period is over and uk is left out alone in the cold , in a desperation to get deals with the whole world . 
  and the world of business is not a charity , they will rough up uk as hard as they can to squeeze the pennies out of uk . 
   i think a lot of people look at hitler and his government as sort of a surreal personality that is so bad it wont happen again . 
  exactly that 's the problem . 
  a hitler is always around the corner . 
  always . 
   i just do n't get it how people seem to completely ignore the lessons of history . 
  to quote a brit :  human beings , who are almost unique in having the ability to learn from the experience of others , are also remarkable for their apparent disinclination to do so . 
  douglas adams, 
   the uk has become the tipsy , tweedy uncle , who after too much christmas sherry has tipped over into drunkenly abusive bore . 
  that sums it up pretty nicely . 
   only if the remaining eu members agree to it . 
  i very sure that from the remaining eu members , at least few will laugh all the way to their parliaments to vote `` no bloody way ! '', 
   if the uk is ahead of france economically for the next french presidential election ( 2022 ) , be sure that france will leave the eu . 
  an excellent point !, 
  sadly ... 
  i do n't know about trumpistan , but if they go with the attitude shown so far , they will get such a deal that eu might need to drop humanitarian aid for one of the coming christmases ... 
   good and well-balanced text ** from verhofstadt . 
  ** just saying , the name is verhofstadt, 
   i 'd take the same amount of time to leave eu , maybe even longer . 
  not really . 
  after article 50 trigger there are 2 years to reach an agreement . 
  if it is not reached , uk leaves with nothing . 
  if all countries agree on the agreement , but one is slow or votes against - again - uk leaves with nothing . 
   our history got ta re-read that one ... 
  realism is for the poor to handle ... 
  so it is all fine ... / s, 
   i should not call italians south europeans , because south europeans are lazy and north italians live in the north europe . 
  according to some north italians i personally know , everything below the river po is africa . 
  so do n't sweat it . 
  the opposite is more logical . 
  if you are a victim of a far-right hate crime you should be protected by being moved as far as possible away from the threat . 
  well , any violation could be twisted to the purpose . 
  say , monitoring general population - something uk power-having want to introduce . 
  maybe call the asusies ? 
  they know how to do it . 
  https://youtu.be/avf6ghyyk5c?t=126 maybe a bit too dramatic for now . 
  but when the global warming starts kicking ... 
  exactly . 
  of course , you cant just leave the nursing home with no care at all and you have to hire extra staff ... 
  this experiment needs to be redone for work where there are tangible tasks with clear results . 
  and drugs !, 
  lots of , lots of drugs !, 
  [ 1st & 3rd place are swiss ] ( http://www.pmlive.com/top_pharma_list/global_revenues ), 
  netherlands tax authorities are notorious for giving special tax deals to the rich and famous . 
  so , it is a `` richist '' tax haven . 
  as long as the dutch can make a buck , discrimination is a non-issue ... [ starbucks ] ( http://nltimes.nl/2015/10/21/dutch-forced-collect-eu20m-extra-tax-starbucks-cabinet-surprised-europe ) [ rolling stones ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/stones-paid-just-16-tax-on-163240m-royalties-410232.html ), 
  actually , they have to be neutral . 
  that 's what they decided themselves and put in their code of conduct/charter . 
  that 's the official rules of the game by which the primaries had to be conducted . 
  by these rules sanders tried to beat clinton . 
  and clinton and dnc cheated him and their whole base . 
  this is not a crime according to usa law , but i do n't see how it can be disputed , or characterised as a trying but cheating/rigging . 
  please , read the linked charter . 
  i even pointed the paragraph . 
  is it still hard for you to find it ? 
  [ now for the rigging ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_democratic_national_committee_email_leak ) :  `` many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine bernie sanders 's presidential campaign . 
  sure , that 's what i said - it 's kind of a law . 
  nobody is going to jail , but being labeled as crook/cheater - for sure . 
  well , the charter is kind of a law . 
  it 's there for a reason and to be followed , not to be fucked at any opportunity ... 
  we elected boyko borisov ... 
  so , it 's not a very long shot ... 
  it is generally agreed that `` to rig '' means `` to manipulate dishonestly for personal gain '' . 
  and that 's what dnc did - they broke their own charter in various ways and manipulated the whole process to work against sanders . 
  there is no question about it . 
  edit : here is the proof [ article 5 , section 4 of the dnc charter requires that the chairperson and all officers be impartial and evenhanded with democratic candidates for president ] ( https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2989759-impartiality-clause-dnc-charter-bylaws-art-5-sec-4.html ) - see second paragraph from the top . 
  the fact that there were not impartial you already admitted , so i wont link to the leaks . 
  now , tell me more about the wmd in iraq ... [ you can trust a thief , but you can not trust a liar . 
  ] ( https://williamblum.org/essays/read/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list ), 
  c'mon , this is getting ridiculous . 
  blog posts are not evidence . 
  especially when they are based mostly on `` used cyrillic '' , `` used russian ip '' . 
   cia , fbi and the intelligence community at large are on the same page . 
  now , tell me more about the wmd in iraq ... you can trust a thief , but you can not trust a liar . 
  yeah , i know this mantra . 
  but it has little merit . 
  sanders had better chances than clinton vs trump . 
  the more exposure he had the bigger his influence grew , if we ignore the obvious primary rigging . 
  you really underestimate the storm that he could have created having honest primary and the full length of the main election . 
  just replying about the destination , not condoning using it . 
  for example all moroccans have by birth moroccan nationality which can not be renounced . 
  so whatever they do they can go ( back ) to morocco and live there without any legal issues whatsoever . 
   by condoning racial profiling to be precise this was behavioral or/and even cultural profiling , not racial . 
  if it would be racial , the police would be banging doors and handing out badges with obligation to be worn at all times for all residents of the city . 
  nothing of the sort happened . 
  not even remotely close . 
  sure , i dont say rome was nice . 
  but the point is - some pretty radical thing happened after he got away . 
  i expect similar happening to go on after pulling away for a central watchdog . 
  plus , echr is not really as bad as `` a vampire squid sucking the life out of the country it embraces '' , right ? 
  henry 8 , did exactly what may wants but with religion .
