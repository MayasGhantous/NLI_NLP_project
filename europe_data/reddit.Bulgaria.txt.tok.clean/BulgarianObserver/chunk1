  the moment we started to follow the eu requirements for joining it our economy went to shit and 8 years later after joining the eu we still ca n't recover [ economic growth in bulgaria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:wiki_economic_growth_in_bulgaria.gif ) . 
  all people are shit , some people are just less shit than others . 
  i hate to disappoint you , but i never claimed that this dude was any better . 
  what i am saying is that we should probably look into the reason why this happened and try to prevent it before it becomes a regular thing . 
  please tell me how much worse and bad we are compared to the middle eastern , asian and american countries . 
  if my country gets in such situation i will fight to my last breath like my ancestors did . 
  we never received any help from the west and i do n't expect you to help us in the future . 
  humans are animals , even with a higher level of intelligence we are still animals and we obey many of our instincts in our daily life . 
  you are really naive if you think that everyone in the world is understanding , honest and tolerant . 
  please , be realistic because this act of horror only confirms my thoughts . 
  i care about facts and positive gains and benefits to the eu society .

  i completely agree with you and i think their argument is ridiculous . 
  international and domestic animal rights activists and organisations . 
  have you studied about the lebanon civil war ? 
  there is a lot of difference and when you have a child of your own you will know what i mean . 
  sorry , i do n't like old people . 
  i 'm an atheist as most of my friends and acquaintances . 
  i 'm tolerant of religious people as long as they do n't try to push their religious nonsense on me . 
  if i expected you to agree with me i would n't post in the `` unpopular opinion '' thread . 
  why is this even a topic ? 
  if you do n't like the food at school bring your own lunch or go out and buy something else to eat . 
  you are playing a dangerous game .

  how much is the human population at the moment ? 
  extract 95 % of the human population , how many are left ? 
  do you think the humans left wo n't be enough to cover everything they need and self sustain as a society ? 
  focusing on technological advancement i am sure we can automate the menial tasks . 
  also humans do n't need fashion , generic practical clothes for both genders would be enough . 
  they make it sound like they are doing it for free . 
  just because the planet does n't care for anything does n't mean you should n't care about it . 
  it needs to be maintained and renovated just like your house . 
  your argument is ridiculous . 
  this is n't about personal preferences but for the greater good of the human species and the planet . 
  no one will force you to live if you do n't want to . 
  you do n't have to fake it you just have to be stabbed in the right place so you do n't die . 
  for thousands of years females managed to survive without pads or tampons . 
  i would prefer medicaments to be tax free or better completely free rather than anything else . 
  i should have worded myself better . 
  we could have this without purging anyone we just have to implement sterilization with which we can get the desired population density and birth rates . 
  i 'm not some crazy mass murderer . 
  the only thing i want eradicated is religion we should study it only as fiction literature like egyptian and greek mythology etc. 
  why ? 
  if your contribution helped other people then you are one of the best . 
  it would be more like slavery , i hope you are n't a slave ? 
  sorry for your daughter . 
  if you are one of the best in the world in your field you have nothing to worry about . 
  no , no one will destroy the knowledge , art and all the other achievements of the human species , on the contrary they will be preserved so the new generations can learn . 
  farming is n't just the process of planting the crops and gathering it there are a lot of external factors , knowledge and experience needed to have maximum productivity . 
  the people remaining should be the best of the best and the smartest of the smartest so we can secure the best possible future for the human species . 
  with the reduction of the population we will remove the energy , and economical oppression so humanity can focus on technological , scientific and cosmological expansion . 
  also consider the ecological benefits for the whole planet . 
  this much more complex to explain but i hope you can get my point . 
  is there any particular reason why people hate them ? 
  yes , sadly . 
  i prefer to let the criminals to work until they die . 
  edit : the ones that deserve a death penalty not all the criminals . 
  the others can work until they serve their time .
