  you never experienced communism , have you ? 
  mate this is the `` unpopular opinion '' thread , calm down . 
  scientist , engineers and farmers . 
  95 % + of the human population needs to be `` removed '' from this planet . 
  yes , i include myself in the percentage that has to be `` removed '' and you are included as well . 
  i would gladly stay home to watch the kids for few years instead of working 40 + hours a week . 
  depends on how tight the border control is and what actions they are allowed to take to retaliate the refugees . 
  are these articles supposed to make us feel sorry for them or their purpose is to show us how unwanted and pretentious the refugees are in reality ? 
  this is hilarious . 
  if you want to be hit by a car or a truck by all means cross where ever you want . 
  but it 's still fun . 
  it 's the same thing as merkel saying she did n't invite the refugees lol, 
  do n't try to explain physics to a muslim , for [ reference ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9jp_xcvvto ) . 
  you can google and youtube it there are plenty of examples like that . 
  you have no idea how right you are !, 
  as soon as their fellow confederate fell the rest of the afghans started following the given orders of the law enforcement officers without any protests or or resistance . 
  people should n't be crossing borders illegally . 
  it 's really simple . 
  no one used such wording on the live news or articles . 
  i call it common sense . 
  freedom of speech should n't be banned or sanctioned in any way but you can make the spreading of false information or lies a criminal act . 
  we do n't know who they are , what is their education degree or what is their medical history because most of them do n't have documents .

  why did you allow her back in the eu ? 
  we have much more in common than with anyone else . 
  you ca n't integrate someone who does n't want to be integrated . 
  context ? 
  i just do n't visit such websites . 
   `` we should be sending a strong message to repressive regimes that the uk is a beacon for human rights and that this contract bid is unacceptable in the 21st century , and would damage britain 's standing in the world . '', 
  am i the only one who thinks this statement contradicts their support of saudi arabia for the un human rights council ? 
  actions mean more than words in my book . 
  is anyone surprised ? 
  i 'm not jerking around i just have a different point of view . 
  in my opinion assad is needed to keep the masses under control , just look what is happening in libya and iraq where the new democracy systems are failing and both countries are torn apart by rebel groups . 
  sometimes the lesser evil is better for the greater good . 
  awesome video , thanks for sharing it . 
  if trying to avoid conflict instead of contributing to fight is somehow mentally retarded than maybe i am . 
   yes good , you are being tamed . 
  and a turkish guy telling me that i am being `` tamed '' will surely make me like the turks more . 
   the poles ? 
  yes good , you are being tamed . 
  i never used the word hate in my statements but thanks to you maybe i will start using it . 
  and you wonder why people do n't like the turks . 
  i agree with you they should have jogged off . 
  can i join you ? 
  i could pretend to be a hobbit from middle earth on a lsd trip to mordor . 
  we could even buy a ring and start a fellowship . 
  i guess they did n't like the syrian barrel bombs , do you think they will like the russian bombs better ? 
  no , he had to do what he had to do to keep the situation under control . 
  what is the actual percentage of syrian refugees in europe compared to the rest of the `` refugees '' ? 
  before the international military intervention in syria the number of people who were escaping the assad `` regime '' looking for better life was so small that it speaks for itself . 
  for [ reference ] ( http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php ) . 
   witnesses reported that there was a mutual struggle and swearing from both parties . 
  sorry it did n't work on me . 
  to avoid the regular paperwork in order to be allowed to stay in a foreign country . 
   we 're all humans who are just looking for a safe place to live to raise our children . 
  sorry to burst your bubble but some humans have different goals . 
  i 'm sure the un human rights council will step in . 
  it was during the communist era . 
  this is hilarious and sad at the same time . 
  nice overview article . 
  your society can only benefit from the `` refugees '' , do n't worry . 
  i know only one vegan so i guess it is n't really popular . 
  torpedoes need water to get to their target but missiles fly . 
  same thing is happening here ... wtf .

  how about the muslims get used to the european culture instead of europeans getting used to the muslims ? 
  how do you classify a terrorist ? 
  was n't she going to accept everyone ?
