  many houses in the town where i live have already installed solar panels so they can save up on electricity bills . 
  so you are claiming that the bulgarian government is lying on their official website ? 
  stop spreading false information please [ krasimir tsipov ] ( https://www.mvr.bg/en/aboutus/managementboard/deputymin_2.htm ), 
  this needs to be for all buildings and mandatory for the whole eu . 
  this is the best analysis i 've read on the current situation so far . 
  you can always count beheading and mutilation as surgical operations . 
  edit : its a joke calm down .

  i made a [ translation ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3n7awi/refugees_refuse_salaries_from_1200_lev_in/cvlgot6 ) specially for you . 
  it was announced by deputy interior minister krassimir tsipov after the session of the parliamentary committee . 
  it 's not like the news website is n't quoting the minister and if you use google you can find other major bulgaria media reporting the same thing . 
  edit : i add some additional information to this [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3n7awi/refugees_refuse_salaries_from_1200_lev_in/cvlgot6 ) . 
  good . 
  i guess your friends work at small or medium farms it also depends on what they are farming do they have contracts to sell everything they grow , the location of the farm land and productivity etc. 
  you ca n't make claims like that . 
  i have friends who have farming jobs . 
  they farm potatoes and sunflowers they receive 1000-2000 lv . 
  salaries . 
  not enough . 
  ** i used google translate for the translation ** here is the article : bulgarian companies offer well paid jobs for refugees , but they refuse to even 1200 levs salary . 
  this was announced by deputy interior minister krassimir tsipov after the session of the parliamentary committee . 
  he explained that more than 50 companies have expressed a desire to give job seekers . 
  `` the conditions offered to them are fairly good - gives them work against the average wage for the country . 
  in some places offered salary 1000-1200 lev as a cowshed in slivnitsa looking breeders lev against 1200 earnings , '' explained zippers . 
  companies seeking refugees drivers , welders , seamstresses , farmers , breeders . 
  however , some refugees agree to work . 
  for example , a large apparel company in petrich has hired seamstresses of migrant workers found the restaurant wraps . 
  overall , however , not more than 5 % of refugees have started work and public authorities at this stage can not get them by force to work or study . 
  ** edit : ** since my last [ post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3mt0od/nikola_kazakov_chairman_of_national_refugee/ ) was removed because i took the liberty to make a tdlr headline title this time i used google translate for the headline and the article .

  only civilians care about other civilians . 
  and you act like no other government committed any sort of crime against their own people . 
  but you need to understand that these regimes there have to deal with people who do n't respect any authority other than allah and the quran . 
  of course the people flee the places where assad is in charge too , the `` rebels '' and isis are attacking these territories to take them over . 
  and they are n't attacking only military bases and personal . 
  no sane person would stay still and wait for the terrorists to come and take them over and slaughter them . 
  its not like there are n't civilian deaths with isis and the `` rebels '' taking over syria . 
  sometimes sacrifices need to be done for the greater good . 
  just like the usa dropped atom bombs in two japan cities to end the war and prevent more casualties in the long run . 
  edit : keep in mind that with isis and `` rebels '' taking over syria you do n't have only civilian deaths but millions of refugees . 
  stabilizing syria at all costs would have more benefits for us then any other action . 
  stop them before they enter italy and greece . 
  this is really irresponsible . 
  change the law . 
  this sounds terrible . 
  football  volleyball  basketball, 
  they want control over syria . 
  overthrowing governments and putting us puppets as their leaders is the way the us has been working for years . 
  the most recent examples can be seen in libya , iraq , and egypt . 
  if you are a curious you can go through their war history for more cases like that . 
  this is hilarious . 
  how many people did fill out this questionnaire is there any information ? 
  43-49 % for bulgaria is really high considering that we managed to save and evacuate our whole bulgarian jewsih population during wwii . 
  through my entire life i had known only one person who had bad opinion of jews . 
  not hate but a bad opinion . 
  i am really surprised to see these numbers , actually i am so surprised that i ca n't believe it . 
  he was just frustrated because no one understands him . 
  i am sure that if you start listening to the them and pay attention to their demands they will integrate into society like any normal person . 
  the real reason is that russia is an official ally of syria and its government . 
  for reference see [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syrian_civil_war ) . 
  source ? 
  i had something like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/e3smqxu07lu?t=51s ) in mind . 
  i am certain that some of our poiliticians do the same we just do n't have any proof . 
  you are making it sound like only russia is using the internet for propaganda . 
  you can always dress up militants as civilians and make accusations . 
  also keep in mind that these rebels keep women and children in their bases as sex slaves so it was inevitable to have casualties . 
  even if they killed civilians stabilizing syria so the people can return to their homes takes priority . 
  the us has to retract its support for the `` rebels '' . 
  ask merkel . 
  they do . 
  like they did n't want to go to crimea ? 
  look what happened and keeps on happening in iraq and libya it is clear that the us shit does n't work or it actually works as intended !, 
  i am with russia and asaad on this one . 
  so you are saying that their integration system is n't working properly ? 
  i bet he wanted to point out that there will be many other countries which would decline the refugee quotas so the eu stops bashing only hungary . 
  do you get free beer ? 
  the us citizens i know are descent and good people . 
  but i do n't agree with your international politics and all the interfering in other nations internal affairs . 
  no , why would it ? 
  go where you want to go not where people tell you to go . 
  i laughed so hard i almost choked . 
  so you are all racist bigots ? 
  i 'm just asking because recently i have been called that a lot . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taryfiurxmq ) is for you . 
  if i was a politician i would be looking for closer diplomatic and friendly relationship with hungary . 
  hello , friends !, 
  saudi arabia and human rights ? 
  i live close to sofia not in the orange zone on ths [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/torlak_dialects_map_en.png/800px-torlak_dialects_map_en.png ) . 
  edit : if you are interested check [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shopi ) out . 
  when i was younger i have heard my grandmother to use the word ** vuk - \u0412\u0443\u043a ** even though the official word in our dictionary for wolf is \u0412\u044a\u043b\u043a . 
  we also sometimes use ** vuk - \u0412\u0443\u043a ** to point out ugly women . 
  this is my personal experience i am not claiming that all regions of bulgaria use or know the word vuk - \u0412\u0443\u043a . 
  we can choose who to give asylum to . 
  it would have been a lot easier for us . 
  how is this relevant to the current discussion ? 
  this is why we want to send them all as far as possible form the conflict zone but merkel is forcing us to keep them here against their free will . 
  the muslim community in our country are more than 10 % of the bulgarian population .
