  please keep in mind that 75-80 % of these refugees are males between 18-30 years with low or no study degrees . 
  what do you think will happen when they do n't feel happy ? 
  its called propaganda .

  good !, 
  `` rock on ! '', 
  looks like a pervert, 
  lol, 
  while it 's true that the negative comment wo n't hurt me it could hurt her . 
   you do n't know she 's underestimating herself , you have n't seen her . 
  it wo n't hurt us if we are a little bit positive . 
  do n't underestimate yourself you should be more confident . 
  i just want to confirm it for myself , you know for science . 
  you need to provide photo evidence to support your claims . 
  i must admit i have few adidas tracksuits and they are really comfortable for everyday use and sports . 
  few weeks ago i had a girlfriend which i was supposed to bring with me on a formal dinner . 
  as i was wearing a suit and a tie she asked me if she should wear her jeans , i was like wtf are you serious wear a dress or something . 
  it 's hilarious until it happens to you . 
   however , once you need to go somewhere ( like down town , for example ) you need to upgrade to jeans because wearing a tracksuit there will earn you the reputation of an `` uncultured peasant '' . 
  the brits are worse than the nazis, 
  this guy is hilarious . 
  showing and telling the truth is not allowed . 
  the eu needs better propaganda . 
  this is a really complicated topic that you are starting here but i 'll try to explain it . 
   imagination : the creative ability to form images , ideas , and sensations in the mind without direct input from the senses , such as seeing or hearing . 
  religion : a unified system of beliefs that is part of a culture , which is passed on through communication between members of a society . 
   communication is a form of direct input from the senses . 
   qed i think you do n't understand what direct input or communication is . 
  you are able to picture the things in your mind when reading because you gave the letters and words meaning . 
  a word is just a writing in the end but through your imagination you are able to read the word sky and see the sky in your mind as you are seeing it for real . 
  in your dreams you are able to experience a lot of things , things that are n't directly affecting your senses in any way a.k.a. 
  direct input which makes it imagination . 
  the example i want to give you is literature . 
  what if you write down your dreams ? 
  the author can create and destroy worlds in his mind , he can imagine anything for his story without direct input related to his seeing or hearing but only using his imagination and later projecting it to the minds of his readers through his writings like the bible , the quran and lord of the rings . 
  in order to have communication established you need to have at least two participants . 
  you commenting and reading the book with your friends is n't communication with the author but a discussion between people . 
  i imagine religious sects like giant book clubs who take literature literally and lack perception of the real world . 
   religion , not imagination . 
  the difference being that religion is something that 's taught to children , and it 's believed to be an undeniable truth . 
  compare it to how we believe that the earth orbits the sun . 
  not because we 've seen it ourselves , not because we made it up , but because it 's been taught to us , and nobody is going to convince you that it 's not true . 
  in 1514 nicolaus copernicus made available to friends his `` commentariolus '' ( `` little commentary '' ) , a forty-page manuscript describing his ideas about the heliocentric hypothesis . 
  in 1610 , galileo published his sidereus nuncius ( starry messenger ) , describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new telescope , namely the phases of venus and the galilean moons of jupiter . 
  with these observations he promoted the heliocentric theory of nicolaus copernicus ( published in de revolutionibus orbium coelestium in 1543 ) . 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/1t8unxy2bgq?t=1m ) you can watch the earth orbit the sun . 
  nowadays telescopes are pretty cheap and i suggest you buy one and see for yourself that the earth orbits the sun as i did . 
  your comparison is absurd . 
  religion = imagination , prove me wrong !, 
   voodoo , money , violence what 's the difference ? 
  voodoo - imagination money - physical currency useful to manipulate others violence - causing physical harm to another human being i hope this answers your question . 
  i feel bad for laughing at this . 
  you are vomiting nonsense trying to justify yourself in some crazy maniacal manner . 
  i do n't understand this racist and nazi obsession of yours . 
  and yes i mistook `` palpably '' and `` probably '' please excuse my lack of english skills . 
  when you are having an argument with someone `` palpably false . 
  you occupied them from spring of 1941 . 
  once again , are you this ignorant , or just a fucking liar ? '', 
  use facts not `` probably false '' because no one will take you seriously . 
  correct macedonia has been a geographical region not a country or a nationality . 
  the british empire killed and starved a lot more people than the nazis , they even supported the ottoman empire when they were slaughtering bulgarians and other balkan people because they were an important partner . 
  so do n't talk to me about moral choices in human history . 
   funny how this type of behaviour is okay on / europe / as long as it 's against the english . 
  some englishmen here called me racist and i thought you had it in mind when i read your comment . 
  and i never said the people in the uk were bad i 'm just tired of this [ bulgarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarians_in_the_united_kingdom ) and romanians are coming narrative . 
   yes , let 's buy our own lives with the sacrificial offering of ten thousand jews . 
  that 's such a contemptible statement there are n't words to describe it apart from ` evil ' . 
  you are fucking evil , and i hope your mother is ashamed of the filth she raised . 
  i think you will find [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwrjpwq5n_4 ) story told by aaron cohen a living survivor of the holocaust really interesting . 
   the second you seized that land and claimed ownership of it , those jews became your , bulgarian , jews to protect . 
  and you did n't . 
  you offered them up to the hangman . 
  you sicken me . 
  we actually did n't seize and claimed ownership over `` macedonia '' because the germans did n't allow it until after the war was over but they lost . 
   macedonia has been recognised as a region since the archaic period , you loon . 
  in wwii , you proceeded to seize part of that region as spoils of the illegal wars you took part in , despoiled the people , and sent the jews to treblinka . 
  the geographic macedonian region is n't fyrom . 
   plenty of other countries were n't `` forced '' to join hitler , mate . 
  they stood , and fought , and did n't ally themselves with the enemies of the human race . 
  your countrymen 's actions and your cringing apologies for them would shame the devil himself , you sickening worm of a man . 
  bulgaria was torn apart during the balkan wars and ww1 by it 's neighbors and we had a choice to be stomped by germany or join them and receive our stolen lands after the war . 
  i do n't apologize for anything and my countrymen did what they thought was the best action for our country at the time . 
  it 's easy for you to judge from this point in history . 
   yes , i quite evidently do . 
  you are a joke . 
  how do you determine if i 'm actually racist , what is your criteria ? 
  sacrifices had to be made in order to save the bulgarian citizens and this is the reason why i said that we saved ** the bulgarian ** jewish and gypsy population and not all of them all over europe . 
  and `` macedonia '' was never a country to be illegally occupied until the 1990s . 
  finally not that it matters but we were actually forced to join germany , we were neutral until 1941 but then hitler poisoned our tzar and threatened us which left us no choice . 
  but i guess you know our history better than i do . 
  if you want to offend me you should have put more effort in it considering we were the only european nation which saved it 's entire jew and gypsy populations during wwii,
