  better invest in weapon technology , science or education . 
  right ... 
  so when they stopped speaking turkic language they stopped being turkic ? 
  am i english because i speak english ? 
  do you mean [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkic_peoples ) ? 
  ancient ( proto - ) bulgarians have long been thought of as a turkic population however the results of the dna tests suggest a western eurasian matrilineal origin for proto-bulgarians . 
   sorry , your link only provided a preview , so i could n't read it . 
  how do they explain the bulgar language in article ? 
  if you mean the wayne state university press doi : 10.13110 / humanbiology .87.1.0019 sience paper you actually have to buy it to read it because it 's actual scientific work . 
  do n't be cheap and support science . 
  lol, 
  dna studies are n't as accurate as wiki articles i agree with you . 
  actually you are wrong proto-bulgarians were n't of turkic origin you should check [ this ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:old_great_bulgaria_and_migration_of_bulgarians.png ) map . 
  as well as these [ genetic maps of europe ] ( http://thedockyards.com/genetic-maps-of-europe/ ) and the [ mitochondrial dna results of ancient ( proto - ) bulgarians ] ( http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.13110/humanbiology.87.1.0019?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ) . 
  then you can read [ this article ],

  if shit hits the fan i hope we can offer an immigration policy to the decent people who value freedom of expression in turkey . 
  you do n't deserve this and everyone should cherish atat\u00fcrk 's legacy . 
   conditions on which side ? 
  and is this a rhetorical question ? 
  not sure what you 're getting at . 
  [ this side ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-migration/background-information/docs/20160504/turkey_progress_visa_liberalisation_roadmap_en.pdf ), 
   because it was promised by the eu in return for stopping refugees . 
  are you sure these were the only conditions ? 
  yes please . 
  we ca n't deal with our corruption on our own . 
  no wonder your country is in ruins lol, 
  men have waged wars for thousands of years and we know that sometimes we have to sacrifice ourselves for the better future of others . 
  and [ the bravest of us ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-38812873 ) will never get captured !, 
  if you burn the male soldiers alive to prepare them you ca n't use them later in combat , are you stupid ? 
  this one is better than the current one in my opinion . 
  no hibernation ? 
  i hope bulgaria gets involved as well . 
  it 's propaganda from different sources . 
  we wanted to stop the migrants with military force but the eu and human rights organisations did n't allow us and still we did a far better job compared to other countries . 
  now that you mentioned it , it certainly looks that way . 
  i should have specified that you should take all the apes except the european ones . 
  i apologize that i 'm not as good at expressing myself in english as a native speaker . 
   we are all apes . 
  hmm , apparently you are blind . 
  what is your point with this quote ? 
  as you can see banning words and renaming things does n't remove racism it only makes it surge again because of all the censorship and persecution of regular people who are fed up with this bullshit . 
  if they actually wanted to do something they would have better education in the military facilities . 
  history has good and bad periods . 
  celebrate the good but never forget the bad so it never repeats . 
  edit : the british empire was a lot worse than the nazi, 
  gang rape * here , i fixed it for you . 
  it 's a legit [ term ] ( https://youtu.be/rsfzktznysg?t=7s ) . 
  the wehrmacht legacy does n't matter to me as bulgarian what matters is the fact that some cunts decided that they did n't like the names of buildings which are named after official service men serving in the german military . 
  should we ask britain to rename all public buildings named after people which served under the british empire ? 
  fake news . 
  this petition thing started in 2012 if i remember correctly and we get this rule of law 5 years later . 
  if the ttip was implemented this court ruling would do nothing and would n't have any meaning . 
  do you get what i mean ? 
  too late !, 
  there is a [ video of the last video call she had with her boyfriend ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hnqbwwnkau ) and in my opinion she is crying and terrified . 
  ** edit : ** if someone can translate what they are saying i 'll be thankful . 
  and since the boyfriend decided to film their conversation i bet he knew something was off . 
  it 's like saying the axis won wwii because they were second lol, 
  do n't know about the situation in poland but here we would accept refugees if they go home after the war in their country ends . 
  context ? 
  notice `` migrants '' not refugees lol, 
  but is n't that european nationalism ? 
  did n't the us services say it was the russians ? 
  uk is still in the eu . 
  should they quit immediately ? 
  this does n't mean anything unless you make and example by punishing the eu commision and make it public . 
  we had a military parade on the sixth of may . 
  i actually checked and i did n't see this material posted before and i do n't see a reason for it to be removed . 
   give me a few thousand chf and i will . 
  i do not have that kinda luxury . 
  i am barely holding on . 
  mostly bc i made a bad decision 5 years back and do not want to abandon my family . 
  so you really are a man child not capable of making rational decisions and too lazy to study and work . 
  do n't you sometimes doubt yourself if your decision to become an anarchist is n't a bad life decision as well ? 
   ** i am a child killer . 
  i invade countries for fun . 
  ** guess where i was born . 
  i have seen my female colleagues insulted and their - and my - complaints brushed off . 
  i have seen people forced into debt over medical conditions they can not be blaned for . 
  i have seen people groped by persons of authority and i have been told it `` will be dealt with '' . 
  a year later . 
  do not pull that crap . 
  would you like that ? 
  it 's happened to me too . 
  shut up . 
  i ca n't take anything you say seriously from this moment on forward . 
   see above . 
  we are not somalia but make no mistake . 
  our rights are a joke . 
  ask any woman here over 30 . 
  and yet you do n't want to explain what is the difference in rights between men and especially women over 30 in our society . 
   i accept every rule of law you wreak ob me . 
  i have been lucky and dodged them . 
  or lived by them . 
  if you take issue bring it on . 
  i can give you my person and `` illegal deeds '' . 
  ask and i will stand to them .
