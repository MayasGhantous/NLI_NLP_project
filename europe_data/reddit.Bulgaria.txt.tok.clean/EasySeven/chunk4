  at the moment a majority of romanians are for , but i do n't think they realize the consequences . 
  supporting the poorest region of europe with a largely uneducated population is simply not in the power of romania . 
  and that is without even thinking about the soviet conflict zone of transnistria . 
  in 20-30 years time maybe , but a reunion now would be a economical and political suicide . 
  that looks quite european to me . 
  so yes i would say a lot of bulgarians look like that . 
  sure bulgarians can range from pale to even arabish looking , however most are on the `` whitish '' side . 
  we certainly have more turkic influence than anyone in eastern europe ( except maybe albania ) however khan asparukh only brought 20-50000 settlers with him compared to the slavic and greek native population numbering in the millions . 
  so the average bulgarian is 80-90 % slavic . 
  as far as eurasian i have n't really noticed any distinct features mongoloid features but its probably because i have n't looked for them . 
  do you mean something like this http://i.imgur.com/8cgbyu2.jpg bear in mind however that i have wider range for `` whiteness '' so most people wo n't agree with me . 
  i have also noticed that turkish girls dye their hair more often than bulgarian girls ... 
  i wonder why ? 
  i perceive turks to be white ( certainly not on the level of poles/swedes/germans / etc but close to italians/greeks/etc . ) . 
  i agree that turkey is more ethnically mixed then usual , with different ethnicities more prominent in different regions . 
  i come in contact with turks quite regularly ( big minority in bulgaria ) and most of the time i can tell they are turkish only from their names . 
  however i do n't think this is a widespread opinion in my country . 
  i would n't say a lot of bulgarians consider turkey to be european either . 
  however i do n't think appearance is why europe classifies turks to be `` non-white '' . 
  culture and religion play a bigger role . 
  however khan asparukh ( the founder of bulgaria ) was turkic as well . 
  the ottoman empire has shaped a lot of balkan cultures so i would say that turks are also european . 
  do you know both egyptian and saudi arabic ? 
  what are the main differences and to what extent do people that speak different dialects understand each other ? 
  would you say that people judge you on your language skills or dialect ? 
  i guess you are right and those are not isolated cases . 
  while the sources you provided are not the most impartial i would be really surprised if they are n't true . 
  sure there were turkish settlers in the balkans and while the turkish government denies the armenian genocide the death of 1 million armenians is fact . 
  however everyone is dying to point that out every thread while conveniently forgetting the atrocities we committed against the turks . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persecution_of_ottoman_muslims millions of ottoman muslims lost their lives and even more were forcibly relocated at the hands of the balkan states . 
  as recently as 1980s my government tried to assimilate muslims and restore their `` real '' identity by changing their names and banning traditions ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_bulgaria#the_.22process_of_rebirth.22 the greek government is also not innocent . 
  atat\u00fcrk was born in thessaloniki but after the balkan wars he could never return to his birthplace . 
  even now turks in western thrace are called `` greek muslims '' . 
  i do n't know much about cyprus but honestly i do n't think it was much more tolerant to the turkish minority . 
  every western country has a past of ethic cleansing and persecution of minorities , often much harsher than the turks . 
  in the end though the past should remain the past . 
  there is no point in constantly creating tensions instead of finally easing them . 
  i would guess it is either an isolated case or propaganda against the turkish personnel in cyprus . 
  it really is a pity that europe is increasingly against turkey everyday but erdogan is n't helping either . 
  turkey gets way more prejudice than it deserves . 
  alcohol is cheap ( probably cheapest in the eu ) and the price of the hotels vary on their location , but it 's still probably cheaper than greece/spain/turkey / etc. 
  it 's not like if they were in europe they would be accepted . 
  likely it was just a convenient excuse to not provide another explanation . 
  let 's be real here being in europe is not really a requirement - cyprus is entirely in asia and it 's still in the eu . 
  however i 'm sure australia will never join the union in its current shape . 
  just looking at which party members voted yes or no gives you a clear indication who is going to benefit from this : [ gerb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerb ) 72 for , 1 against . 
  party with the biggest share of parliamentary seats and arguably benefits most from this . 
  also as the ruling party it probably has the biggest media influence and is the most recognised . 
  the patriotic front 18 for , also arguably benefits from this because their voters are younger . 
  [ bsp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_for_bulgaria ) ( 25 against ) and [ dsp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/movement_for_rights_and_freedoms ) ( 27 against ) are the big losers from this . 
  bsp has a much older demographic than the rest of the parties . 
  mostly pensioners and older socialist vote for them and this demographic has a much bigger turnout then younger people . 
  dsp votes come mostly from ethnic turk who also have a much much higher turnout then ethnic bulgarians . 
  attack is the nationalistic party and votes 2 for and 2 against . 
  [ the reformers ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reformist_bloc ) 13 for , 5 against . 
  i am not very familiar with the rest of the parties to make comments . 
  according to page 58 of [ this un report ] ( http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/files/wpp2012_highlights.pdf ) nigeria 's population in 2100 will be 913m . 
  extrapolating further with about 4,5 million natural growth per year nigeria 's population in 2116 would be in the low 980m , which i deemed was close enough to 1 billion . 
  more detailed information can be found in [ this report ] ( http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/publications/files/wpp2012_volume-ii-demographic-profiles.pdf ), 
  huh that is `` nothing '' . 
  look at nigeria - about 120 million on the eve of 2000 and more than 180 million today . 
  that is more population growth in 15 years than the population of almost every european country . 
  if that was n't bad enough nigeria 's population is projected to surpass 1 billion in about 100 years . 
  we are talking about a projected growth of more people than europe here and that 's only one african country ... 
  at a quick glance at the [ russian demography page ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_russia ) i see all relevant information taken from the [ statistical institute of russia ] ( http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/rosstat_main/rosstat/ru/ ) . 
  a lot of times extended statistics such as fertility rate are only shown in the native language and not the english adaptation but as a general rule the wikipage on demographics of a country should be good enough source . 
  the world factbook uses absolete data and was never the best in estimations anyway . 
  use national sources if you want the most uptodate information . 
  but chechnya is n't the only region with such a high vote . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russian_legislative_election,_2011#results_per_region ) shows like ten more regions with unusually high turnout ( in the 90s ) and all of it is going to russia united . 
  all i need to see is [ this picture ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/2011_duma_votes.svg ) and i know that a substantial amount of vote manipulation is going on . 
  only russia united has that non-normally distributed vote that shouts election fraud . 
  i 'm sure the majority of the vote is valid especially in urban areas and western russia but nobody can deny there is a substantial amount of vote manipulation going on . 
  i do n't pretend to know much about the inner politics of russia but if you claim that united russia got 99 % of the vote in chechnya ( a region russia was bombing less than 2 decades ago ) democratically and just because `` there was no alternative '' you are clearly deluded . 
  i speak bulgarian and while i understand a lot of the russian words ( something like 50 percent ) if i think about them the grammar is very different . 
  they have '' \u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0436\u0438 '' which are very foreign to me and the language as a whole sounds emphasized on the vowels in contrast to the accent of bulgarian i grew up with , which is much softer . 
  so i can probably understand the general meaning and direction of the conversation but i ca n't speak it at all . 
  keep in mind a lot of bulgarians have had lessons in russian in high school (  50 % ) whereas i have never learned it . 
  i am sure those nukes have codes that turkey does n't have and if they have to be used usa gives the codes to them . 
  so in the event that turkey does decide to keep them , which would be a pretty dumb idea , they would be useless . 
  but anyway there is no way usa is kicking turkey out of nato . 
  there are a lot of reasons they were one of the first members . 
  it 's far from the best in the world but it 's certainly much much better than the rest of the developed countries . 
  i feel as though you have some agenda . 
  i am not the most knowledgeable on the topic but the ottoman empire of the 15 16th century was very religiously and ethnically tolerant much more than the western countries of that period . 
  what you have said might be true because hungary was in ottoman possesion for a short period but i really would like a more solid source than a story of a grandparent to believe it . 
  honest question , how is ireland , a highly developed economy , posting china-like results in what seems every single year ? 
  i have heard it being a tax haven but there has to be more to it ? 
  i am curious was there a ban on imgur in september since i was in istanbul at that time and could n't access it ? 
  is that really true ? 
  i feel as though turkey would n't have agreed to those conditions and with rightful cause . 
  i have arrived at the conclusion that he is either the most committed troll i have ever seen in my entire life or a retarded person with a very warped view of reality . 
  what the fuck is happening in paris ? 
  let 's hope those hostages are rescued unharmed but another shooting in 2015 . 
  my heart goes to all those affected . 
  i honestly thought it was sarcasm at first ... 
  guess not . 
  i agree that there can be significant differences from april ( my source ) to november . 
  moreover eurobarometer is an eu polling institution and it is n't hard to see how it can be biased towards further integration . 
  the percentages you linked are for whether people think the euro will have positive or negative influence at a national level .
