  for example , there were about 7.5 million bulgarians at the peak ( in 1989 ) but today there are only about 6 million left . 
  does n't happen in bulgaria either . 
  in the case of bulgaria and indirectly in the case of serbia , that did happen , so it was n't only a pretext . 
  i do n't think that cartoonish means much worse . 
  according to the russian wikipedia , he started out in futsal , since there were no conditions for football in norilsk . 
  not if the missiles are intercepted before separation . 
  if they can stop russian weapons , then they are directed against russia . 
  do you expect me seriously to believe that the shield is directed against iran , considering its location and considering that iran has neither nuclear weapons nor icbms ? 
  turkey has not installed a missile shield directed at russia , so no surprise there . 
  they do have a point - russia should have screened recruits better , especially for an assignment abroad . 
  on the other hand , the courts have ruled him mentally competent to stand trial , so he is n't actually insane . 
  why are they facing inquiry ? 
  they should be shut down and the so-called judges involved in them prosecuted for usurping the prerogative of the justice system . 
  the lithuanian hypocrisy and lack of memory is astounding . 
  for years they operated ignalina , ( a chernobyl type reactor and thus far more dangerous than the one being constructed and never paid the slightest attention to belarussian worries about the reactor , but now belarus is supposed to consult them before building a reactor on its own territory . 
  for some reason having an actual rbmk reactor on your own territory never seemed to bother your government , considering how strenuously they fought to delay its closure . 
  this is perhaps due to mainstream parties mostly adopting their positions . 
  there was never an option of not allowing the russians to stay , since attempting ethnic cleansing would have ended up with estonia and latvia would end up with them losing large amount of territory , possibly including their capitals . 
  so they did the next `` best '' thing , hoping to drive them away by depriving them of citizenship . 
  unfortunately , most russians have proven stubborn and remained , so now both countries have large russian minorities that are resentful of the treatment they 've received . 
  [ nope ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanians_in_ukraine ) . 
  ortodox albanians who moved to bessarabia to escape ottoman rule , like the bulgarians and gagauz . 
  note that this is for native language , a somewhat nebulous concept . 
  many people who speak predominantly or even almost exclusively russian and might not speak ukrainian well or at all declare ukrainian to be their native language due to it being their ancestral language . 
  this is probably quite smaller than the number of russians who are immigrating . 
  it 's either that or georgia reconquering south ossetia , likely followed by ethnic cleansing ( which is what happened to about 100 thousand ossetians in the 90s ) . 
  some peoples have only a limited choice of allies . 
  what kind of history are you being thought in finland ? 
  finland had allowed german troops to be placed on their territory which started attacking the ussr from the first day of the war . 
  this is a de-facto declaration of war and it inevitably lead to a soviet retaliation , immediately used as a pretext to start the invasion by the already battle ready finnish army . 
  but even if this was true , no one forced finland to go beyond its prewar borders , much less imprison the russian civilian population in concentration camps . 
  also no one forced them to help the german effort by attempting to link up with the german forces south of the svir river or to allow german naval units to be stationed on the ladoga lake in an attempt to interdict the supply of leningrad . 
  finns always claim that they were not really allies , but only co-belligerents , so why were they assisting the german effort to capture leningrad , if that was supposedly not a finnish war aim ? 
  which amounted to the same since without a veto the bombing of libya has un support . 
  considering that i 'm being down-voted for stating simple facts , perhaps i should n't avoid making more controversial statements . 
  so the answer to your question is yes , karelia ( meaning the former finnish karelia ) is part of russia fairly . 
  any moral high ground that finland gained from the unprovoked ussr aggression in 1939 was irretrievably lost due to finland 's aggression in 1941 , their appalling treatment of the soviet civilian population in the occupied karelian ssr and their collaboration in the siege of leningrad . 
  therefore at this point punishing finland at the end of war with the loss of karelia was indeed fair . 
  it 's internationally recognized as part of russia ( as is kaliningrad ) , unlike the other territories listed . 
  fairness has nothing to do with this ( and is highly subjective , anyway ) . 
  furthermore , most of karelia was never in finland in the first place . 
  [ bulgarian borders in this period ] ( https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:prima_guerra_balcanica.bg.png ) . 
   now , remember that russia is now responsible for maintaining the signs in crimea , abkhazia , south ossetia , transnistria , ** karelia ** , ** kaliningrad ** etc. 
  these two do n't fit . 
   medvdev has the same foreign policy as putin false . 
  for example medvedev supported the intervention in libya , while putin was opposed . 
   who the hell runs bulgaria ?? 
  people who consider the opinion of the us ambassador more important than what their electorate wants . 
  i do n't know about romania , but except for a few us agents like the foreign minister mitov , most bulgarians would certainly prefer this to cooperation with turkey . 
  nice to see that we 're no longer seen as a balkan country , despite that almost the entire [ mountain ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkan_mountains ) for which the balkans was named is on our territory , 
  the actual number of crimean tatars serving in the red army was about 10 thousand ( this is number listed for may 1944 ) , while nearly 20 thousand served as nazi collaborators . 
  indeed , if such ridiculous hysteria is actually common in sweden , then it 's inevitable . 
   retaking the baltic states would give russia a land route to their interests in kaliningrad at this point , reading further is pointless since obviously is describing a world which has only vague similarity to the one we actually live in ... 
  the first sane comment in this thread being massively downvoted . 
  typical [ / r/europe ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe ) ... 
  all of this flirting with the crimean tatars will ensure that the 86 % of crimeans who are not crimean tatars will never want to return to ukraine . 
  the crimean tatars are very unpopular with the rest of the population , both due to their extensive collaboration with nazi germany and their recent efforts ( quite often violent ) to gain back properties and land they owed before 1944 . 
   ukraine says `` god forbid this never happens again '' , russia says `` we can do it again ! '' . 
  that 's why russia parades it 's newest death machines every may 9th . 
  yes , i 'm sure that russians really want to repel another disastrous invasion . 
  could n't you think of a more ridiculous accusation ? 
   are ukrainian `` veterans '' parades same as other there ? 
  a a bunch of people who were kids or even not born during ww2 talking about how good cccp was ? 
  and maybe one or 2 token veterans approaching 100 who come there to meet their friends . 
  my impression is that they mostly commemorate the victory in wwii . 
  but i 'm sure you the better and the more objective source on what they really think ...  you would n't believe how many times i was called fascist/nazi/etc for not answering to them in russian ... 
  yes , i wo n't believe it because i 'm extremely doubtful it happened even once . 
  in lithuania most russians speak lithuanian and being a small minority , i doubt that they would dare do that in any case ( and your story sounds like it was copied from somewhere anyway ) . 
  so stop lying . 
  there are several countries in eastern europe that would have given 12 points to an anti-russian song even if it was accompanied by three unbroken minutes of nails scratching on metal . 
  a great benefit of the new voting system is that we could plainly see that politics and not quality decides the jury vote , as amply demonstrated tonight . 
   time europe starts taking this security serious , as she historically always has . 
  throughout the last few centuries one part of europe has done so , while the other part has eagerly allied with russia to fight them . 
  with this decision , russia would be fully justified to place nuclear weapons in crimea and in kaliningrad oblast once this system is extended to poland . 
  i hope romanians and poles think that becoming permanent targets to nuclear attack makes whatever security they are going to derive from the abm systems ( though if they are not directed against russia , why would that be the case ) . 
  the only surprising region here is lipetsk oblast . 
  why is it so wealthy ? 
   it 's equally good for southern slavic false , especially for bulgarian which looks hideous when written in latin . 
   it 's worse for czech false as well . 
  all of the extra letters for consonants would n't be necessary ( except \u0159 ) . 
  extra letters would still be needed for the long vowels , but then the latin alphabet ca n't handle them either . 
  this is completely untrue . 
  all slavic languages have multiple sounds which have no letters in the latin alphabet , but do in the cyrillic . 
  slavic languages using the latin alphabet have to insert multiple additional letters to the standard 26 letter alphabet . 
  where do you think you got the cyrillic from ? 
  see ? 
  what was the point of backpedaling when under the slightest prodding you showed you true ( very ugly ) colours ? 
  i do n't think that further discussion would be a good idea at all , but i did wonder at this :  ** you ** are pure evil and a cancer of humanity for the past 100 years or more , filthy imperialist mad dogs that need to be put down for the sake of humanity . 
  are you colorblind , if you ca n't distinguish green from blue ? 
  i am quite capable of reading what you wrote , your ridiculous backpedaling is pointless . 
  though what you 're writing now is also disgusting and hypocritical ( you want moldova to have its territorial integrity but dream about russia being destroyed ) . 
  no one is being exterminated in russia ( or in moldova , what was that about ) and for the most part no one would benefit from yet more balcanisation . 
  and if you want people to be left alone , you should give up on transnistria where the majority of the population is not moldovan and has little desire to joining your country . 
  for coming from a country with such a large russian minority , you have absolutely no clue about their worldview . 
  there is no such thing as a `` wwii cult '' or at least not in any way you imagine it to be . 
  the memory of wwii is about repelling at great cost the german invasion , not about dreaming about conquests . 
  and if there is regret about the collapse of the ussr , it is largely due to the treatment received by their compatriots in the new independent states as well as the hostile attitude adopted by many of these countries . 
  to be blunt , the struggle for independence happened because gorbachev allowed it . 
  as for the armed clashes , if the intention was to prevent the baltic states from seceding , this would have been done and easily - the baltics had absolutely no armed forces . 
  but there is no evidence that any of the attacks had been ordered by the central government,
