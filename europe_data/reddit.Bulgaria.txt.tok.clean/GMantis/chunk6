  it 's about 3.5 million . 
  the largest city in the region is arkhangelsk . 
  why do i have the feeling that it initially said `` finnish land '' ? 
  but even if it was n't , i do n't see why russia could n't have a window in st petersburg , even if it was once ancient finnic land . 
  so was most of northern russia . 
  in fact , all over europe people live over what was once ancient land of someone else . 
  why should the russians be singled out ? 
  is this some kind of a joke ? 
  the tatar language has been made compulsory even for non-tatars within tatarstan . 
  it 's the least threatened minority language in russia . 
   this land was only populated by georgians 4 centures ago . 
  the fact that your people used to live in a place 4 centuries ago does n't give you any rights to a territory . 
  if you do think so , when is france giving back alsace ? 
   i think , not sure , i ca n't find any data about the situation before 1918 so you have basically no evidence and simply presume the history to be as convenient to you as possible . 
  for your information , the [ ethnic composition in south ossetia before 1918 ] ( http://www.ethno-kavkaz.narod.ru/rnsossetia.html ) was very similar to that after 1918 , though the ossetians were a somewhat higher proportion of the population and the georgians a somewhat lower population of the population . 
   georgian until ** the ossetians who decided to settle there ** attacked the georgians starting from 1918 ( hence `` ethnic cleansing separatists '' wow . 
  i knew that the caucasus was renown for the longevity of its people , but to have the ossetian settlers of the 17th century ( according to your own post ) still alive is really remarkable !, 
   it still had a 1/3 georgian population despite the separatism of the ossetian part of the population not 10 years ago . 
  your analogy to `` georgia splitting off from ussr '' is hollow . 
  georgia had about a third non-georgian population when it became independent . 
  the analogy is not nearly as far-fetched as you think . 
  `` oppressing every minority '' is too subjective to be considered , but where has russia banned a language any time recently ? 
   another thought why nobody asks austria , italy , hungary , bulgaria , romania for reparation . 
  ( rhetorical question ) apart from austria , these countries did pay reparations , per the decision of the [ 1947 peace treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paris_peace_treaties,_1947#war_reparations ) . 
  that there were attacks on civilians does n't mean that they were ethnically cleansed . 
  tskhinvali remained georgian after the war . 
  what did happen is that about a tenth or more of the ossetians living the region were killed in the suppression of the uprising , which looks far more like ethnic cleansing . 
   only on the battlefield . 
  the moment she was captured , they are obligated to treat her as a prisoner of war and follow the international conventions which regulate that status . 
  isis are terrorists , not a legitimate fighting force . 
  they do not have any protection under international law and captured fighter do not have the status of prisoners of war . 
  what ethnic cleansing of 1918 ? 
  i suppose when grad rockets are falling on your own territory they do n't bring destruction and death but peace and freedom . 
  i can agree with this sentiment . 
  the problem is they want the whole of south ossetia , including the part that is not georgian . 
  especially considering that wanting that part led to the loss of the part they controlled before 2008 . 
  no , i 'm not going to call nazi-occupied countries nazi , but i 'm certainly going to use this word for the nazi collaborators you implicitly denied existed in your post . 
  presumably when there were over twenty estonian volunteer police battalions either guarding nazi concentration camps within estonia or committing war crimes while being engaged in counterinsurgency work on behalf of the nazis outside estonia . 
   yes , there are several theories and the one you are presenting is in a clear minority . 
  most historians claim they are of turk origins as i mentioned above . 
  i have nothing to gain from them being of whatever origins . 
  i am merely presenting things as they are today . 
  and today most consider them turks , which means there are not enough evidences for the theory you are supporting . 
  this theory is very popular in turkey and therefore in the west , but most researchers consider their origin disputed and mention the various theories . 
  the fact that genetic sources completely contradict this theory is a heavy strike against , however popular it might be among historians . 
   different traditional clothes and different traditions than the bulgarians . 
  certainly , but there are also obvious similarities . 
   lol !, 
  i like how you strategically left out the part where it said they are genetically similar to romanians too , greeks , etc. 
  bulgarians and romanians are very genetically similar . 
  the greeks are more distant except for greek macedonia which was strongly influenced by the slavs . 
  what the gagauz are not in anyway similar to is the turks . 
   the similarity to neighboring populations may be due to the lack of social barriers between the local and the turkic-orthodox populations of the balkan peninsula this quote is from a separate section of the article and is not supported by a source . 
  while it is true to an extent , there would be at least some similarity with the turks which is simply not the case . 
   ps : i just wanted to add that i 'd keep keep some skepticism regarding various dna studies at the level of populations . 
  because there are some pretty controversial studies out there . 
  for example , i remember there was a study claiming bulgarians are closest genetically to the romanians , not other slavic or volga based ethnic groups . 
  it was y dna . 
  the mtdna results claimed they were closest to the poles . 
  there were highly controversial studies on greeks too , if i remember correctly . 
  besides , the samples usually used for these studies are ridiculously low . 
  this is why one looks at combined results . 
  or at autosomal studies which include more genes , like the study you quoted . 
  there is also nothing surprising about the fact that bulgarians are closer to romanians when you consider that both peoples are a mixture to a different extent between the local inhabitants of the balkans and the slavs . 
  i 'd be interested in your study about mtdna because all studies i 've seen show the similar results to the y dna and autosomal dna - bulgarians being closer to their neighbors than to distant slavic groups . 
  in bulgaria official documentation and school education in entirely in bulgarian , even in overwhelmingly turkish areas . 
  this does n't mean that turks will not nearly always use turkish among themselves . 
  you have n't actually shown that russian has replaced their native language . 
  i do know that most bulgarians in bessarabia have n't lost their native language , so i find it unlikely that this would be the case among the gagauz . 
  except for some bulgarian historians who claim they are in fact turkified bulgarians , so they do not recognize them as an ethnic group in bulgaria , the great majority of the historians out there considers them turks . 
  either oghuz either seldjuk . 
  they were christianized in the byzantine empire somewhere on today 's territory of bulgaria , they may have borrowed a few things from the majority , but even the russians back then noted that they were different than the bulgars . 
  what you are claiming is just one of many competing theories . 
  as i pointed out above , they are genetically much closer to bulgarians than they are to turks or any turkic peoples . 
  there is no reliable historical evidence of any seljuk settlement in their homeland before the turkish conquest . 
  their culture is very close to the bulgarian one and in fact they were classified as bulgarians during the early period of their settlement in bessarabia . 
  how are they russified ? 
  they mostly speak gagauz - a turkish dialect - among themselves and the fact that they prefer using russian instead of romanian when communicating with the other peoples of moldova does n't make them russified . 
  you might call them turkified bulgarians , considering how similar they are to bulgarians - both genetically and culturally . 
  he was not a member of the kgb . 
  yeltsin would not have been affected by a law made on the czech model and putin would not have been affected after 2000 . 
  finnic maybe , but not finnish . 
  the finns living around st petersburg had been settled there during the swedish rule in the 17th century and parts of the native finnic peoples , like the izhorians fled to russia rather than living under swedish rule . 
  this is untrue . 
  the germans bombed london first and they had been bombing of many other populated settlements even before that . 
   art . 
  the attack or bombardment , by whatever means , of towns , villages , dwellings , or buildings which are ** undefended ** is prohibited . 
  dresden was defended - both by flak and night fighters . 
  [ south ossetia had an ossetian majority before the war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_ossetia#demographics ) . 
  so if georgia can claim the region due to it having 30 % georgians , ossetians have a much better claim due to being 66 % of the population . 
  and if the ossetians have somehow lost their right to the province due to ethnic cleansing , then so have the georgians after they [ ethnically cleansed tens of thousands of ossetians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_ossetia#georgian-ossetian_conflict ) . 
  this seems a bizarre interpretation of a travel ban . 
  this would be similar to all countries along a plane 's route demanding transit visas to all passengers on the plane . 
  no wonder the aggrieved reaction , as undiplomatic as it was . 
   nothing is left in prussia of prussian culture . 
  it 's fully commie looking , ** russian ** populated territory that lost all it 's historical meaning . 
  [ warmian-masurian voivodeship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warmian-masurian_voivodeship ) ironically a lot of monuments removed were from this region . 
  it 's more like the pot calling the fridge black . 
   all dna studies show very little slavic genes in the dna of modern bulgarians , mostly thracian and bulgar . 
  nope , absolutely no dna studies show any similarity with are supposed to be bulgar genes ( it 's not clear what they should be like , but none of the theories fit ) .
