  got me again . 
  what atheists ? 
  no one is denying the deiety exists trought history . 
  it 's connection to bulgarian however is more socialist fiction than fact . 
  the sources tying the two toghether are either secondary and thetriary narratives or some primary ones that are quite open to interpretation . 
  at this point , the situation on the roads is so dire , it 's down to anything that might work ... 
  tangra is a mongolian fire deiety . 
  it has nothing to do with this rite . 
  i thought `` flash mob '' was when peple on the street randomly burst out into dance . 
  i would n't call it a flash mob . 
  yesterday was the [ 24-th ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/168753/bulgaria+celebrates+national+day+of+culture+and+slavic+script ) so it was probably an organised event . 
  actually is most modern democracies 30 to 45 percent is a convincing majority , because a lot of votes are usually spread out to smaller parties and a lot of people do n't vote . 
  50-70 is doable , but it meansthere is a very poor oppostion . 
  anything above 70 is a dictatorship . 
  besides , if you preffer the socio-centric wiev of history , 30 % is all you need to make changes . 
  [ here are some videos from the celebrations ] ( http://bnt.bg/news/obshtestvo/24-maj-denyat-na-ba-lgarskata-prosveta-i-kultura ), 
  about a mounth ago there was a mass tour operator protest and in some of the interviews they mentioned being asked about security concerns . 
  ( sorry , most of the sources are vids in bulgarian ) anyway the number of [ russian bookings has actually climbed ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/167946/interest+of+russian+tourists+in+bulgarian+black+sea+grows ) , but as a whole remains far lower than previous years . 
  sadly , a lot of the know-how never stayed up to date . 
  we can probably handle some parts and maintainance , but for the short term future , the only option is to import fighter planes . 
  the current ones are getting quite old and the time for a procurement deal is long past due . 
  actually it would be for the best if russians travell to other countries and see what is really happening there . 
  this year the number of russian tourists in bulgaria plummeted to almost zero . 
  problems in the sector notwithstanding , it seem that people are being told that if they come here they are going to be beat up for being russian and it 's nota safe tourist destiantion . 
  at the turn of the century , bulgaria was one of the first countries to adopt and develoup aviation . 
  we were one of the first countries to use airplanes in warfare - the balkan war 1912 , right after the tripolitanian war . 
  asen yordanov , the father of bulgarian aviation , was an engineer who created the first bulgarian airplane `` yordanov-1 '' in 1915 . 
  after ww1 the bulgarian air corps were dismantled and yordanov emigrated to the us . 
  he went on to work for curtiss-wright , lockheed , douglas and boeing . 
  in 1941 yordanov founded his own company jordanoff aviation , working out of madison ave. 
  he wrote a number of publications and books , which became a staple of aviation literature and some were even translated in the ussr , despite the fact that yordanov was declared `` undesirable '' by the communists . 
  some of his books include - your wings , flying and how to do it , through the overcast , jordanoff 's illustrated aviation dictionary and others . 
  tzvetan lazarov is another bulgarian engineer who helped create some of the most popular bulgarian airpalnes , including the [ dar series ] ( http://reocities.com/paris/cabaret/2459/aviation/bgplanes/photos/dar9siniger9.jpg ) [ dar-1 uzunov , circa 1926 ] ( http://www.lostbulgaria.com/pic2/4398.jpg ) and the [ laz series ] ( http://history.rodenkrai.com/new/images/stories/laz-11.jpg ) . 
  when the communists came to power a lot of the planes were dismantled . 
  the dsf factory was closed down , the dar factory was repurposed to produce ... motorised bicycles , and the country was forced to purchase airplaned from the comecon . 
  and that is why we need a fighter procurement programme . 
  a ton of movies get shelved for ages , sometimes literally - fury road came 12 years later . 
  and now the russians are going to be like - look at the backwards , undemocratic monkeys . 
  have you ever concidered that thaat might be intentional ? 
  i 'm betting in the end they shake hands and start living together . 
  this is n't a conspiracy theory it 's the truth - entertainment mediums have been used for shaping the mass ' opinions for ages . 
  besides , there is n't really that much of a story to go on , even with the books , so the writer are free to make any changes they like . 
  90s ee migration was a nightmare . 
  all the huge benefits countries like the us offered were actually a `` screw the ussr , look how rich we are '' statement . 
  by 1989 all the free housing , language courses and integration programs had all but dried up and ee received the full mexican treatment . 
  also , people would get shot at best , or sent to the mines for trying to cross the border . 
  not quicker , but somewhat more dignified and honorable , as it resembles a combat death . 
  the needle may be painless and easy , but there is a huge element of psychological torture as well as having death be turned into such an easy mechanical procedure . 
  think of it like a ckeck list . 
  the less educated/pro russian they are , the more they blame on eu and soros . 
  homos , hobos , thansvestites , transsexuals , metrosexuals , pedophiles , the industry collapse in the 90s , emmigration , murder rates , corruption , prostitution , educatio decrepidation , obesity and the refugees . 
  as opposed to hang , drown and quarter . 
  that 's a rule of thumb that 's been going since the early days of the roman empire . 
  they are only good guys , if they support us , otherwise they are terrorists . 
  you 're going to prison for coruption !, 
  and you 're going to prison for coruption !, 
  and you 're going to prison for coruption !, 
  and you 're all going to prison !, 
  some time ago a gypcy teen raped a mentally disabled girl from his school . 
  faced with the very real possibillity of authoritied doing jack some people led a peacefull protest in the gypcy hood . 
  the gypcies taunted the protesters and waived obviously illegal firearms , which was ignored by the police in order not to escalate the situation . 
  the us ambassador said that we should be more tollerant and not give in to racism . 
  the exact same week us cops neutralised that 12-year-old black kid playing with a toy gun . 
  i have the distinc feeling the desighner had their project and a doodle lying around , mixed the two , but only realised that mixed the two once minting had stared . 
  then they were like : `` um , uh ... modern art ! '', 
  kill it !, 
  kill it with fire !, 
  here 's a little hint - if your morals are so weak that they fall apart at the slightest provocation , they did n't exist to begin with . 
  actually i could have written more , but i do n't think he 's worth the bother , so i stick to current events . 
  he even wrote a very anti-russian article in 92-ish . 
  his minions have been quite successful in keeping a lid on that . 
  top gear is well pirated in bulgaria . 
  he is the leader of a fomerly 10 % neonazi party ( currently 2 % ) . 
  after the fall of the oresharski govt , he 's had at least 7 incidents , including international ones - he punched a cop and a french diplomat , assaulted patrons in a high-end brussels restauraunt etc. 
  he 's open about being paid by russia , supports leaving nato , eu and joining putin 's eurasian union . 
  most recently ( last week was elctions ) he and his goons attacked a 24/7 duck shop , claiming that it was selling drugs , or contraband cigaretts , or durgs and contraband cigaretts - they ca n't decide on a narrative . 
  ( btw , the shop is run by siderov 's former bodyguard . 
  years ago , siderov shot his firearm at an abulance with an old guy in it , claiming that it cut him off and the grandad opened the backdoor and dumped a pack of urine on his car . 
  the bodyguard denied all of this in court and left the party . ), 
  he also invaded the national film and dance academy natfiz , searching for some drug selling student that suposedly slapped two of his party compatiots . 
  ( hardly believable since the few people who support his are neonazi hooligans and relics ) he was escorted out . 
  on election night he stormed the building again and a lynch mob of about 200 to 600 people formed . 
  the police literally saved his life , but he got punchd and slaped on the back of the head . 
  the action is the most commented event last two day . 
  while most people do n't support violence , his antics , as well as the desecration of national symbols has gotten a lot of people fed up . 
  [ extremely close up video of the night in question . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfxp9tl7bea ) the good stuff starts around the 4 min . 
  mark . 
  edit : [ video from some time before . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bz9qnr9vsc ), 
  let 's not trouble then nice europen people with our mentally troubled 2 % party leaders . 
  because they can 'd do anything right . 
  [ `` today , leaders representing albania , austria , bulgaria , croatia , ** the former yugoslav republic of macedonia ** , germany , greece , hungary , romania , serbia and slovenia met in brussels at the commission 's berlaymont headquarters ... '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eq56mac.gif ), 
  looks like the poles ... ( sunglasses ) went to the polls !, 
  `` challenge accepted . '', 
  - putin, 
  voting sections outside the country vote only for the referendum . 
  the localisation law disqualifies almost all immigrants from voting in the local elections . 
  not much . 
  they never really left the middle ages , when marriage was arranged .
