  i just love love everyone ignores the fact that before tripping that guy , she almodt got stampeded over by the mob . 
  more like a cold shower for the radical leftists who 've been trying to gestapo their views . 
  [ 1994 , still relevant today ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sznkuluwfdg ),

  pass !, 
  '' - ghengis khan . 
  there were at least 6 in deep rural bulgaria . 
  they only got discovered because of a tv report . 
  the police shut them down , but , i 'm willing to bet money new ones have sprung up . 
  because that worked out so well the first time ... 
  [ ftfy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlbuf2xnequ ), 
  [ photos of the location where the incident took place . 
  ] ( http://www.dnes.bg/stranata/2015/10/16/kyrvavata-drama-krai-sredec-pod-most-na-sredecka-reka.279916,image4#photo ), 
  that is just not true . 
  for fourty years bulgaria was a socialist state and the mao crede of only the party and police can own weapons was strictly adhered to . 
  even today to own a firearm you need two permits , a safe and to have a proof of need , meaning that 90 % of civilians can not own firearms . 
  most of the firearms owned are hunting smooth bore or carabine rifles . 
  also colectors and recreation artists who own 100 + single shot flintlock pistols also add to that count . 
  now compare that with wedding videos from afganistan where half the wedding guests are shooting ak-s . 
  yes , a person 's death is sad , however there is such a thing as escalation of force . 
  concidering how reserved bulgarian leos are , they would n't have drawn weapons unless it was absolutely necessary . 
  also all the officials quickly `` forgot '' the part where the migrant had a firearm among his posessions and are now calling it an `` accident '' , because the bullet `` ricocheted '' after a warning shot . 
  this happened inside the country , near [ \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0446 city ] ( https://www.google.bg/maps/place/8300+%d0%a1%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b5%d1%86/@42.2664328,26.6146109,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x40a71d43c9764577:0x400a01269bf4e00?hl=bg ) , not at the border . 
  they did not stumble on a group of 54 unidentified , they were dispatched because of a breach allert . 
  `` a bit of the ol mass murder and genocide . 
  just not my cup of tea . 
  oh , well , carry on . '', 
  sieg polutical correctness . 
  may multiculturalism live a hundred years . 
  wait , did n't these things happen only in america ? 
  no , i did . 
  i 'm however talking about this general apologist trend . 
  actually if they 've been a member of is - first it 's pretty much impossible to proove what they have and have n't done . 
  and second - it does n't matter , if 90-something auschwitz guards are being sued , reguardless of what their actual postion in the chain of command was , so should these people . 
  there simply is no justification , moral or legal , to be lenient with legally adult people who willingly joined an organisation whose recruitment includes videos of beheadings and being able to purchase human being at realy good prices . 
  the do not deserve a chance to useful member of society . 
  good , now i know which brands not to support . 
  30.09 % to 43.9 % at best is hardly massive support . 
  even with all the bullying and the election forcing , they still had to enter a coalition to have a majority vote . 
  well , a lot of people did n't really care when that funny fellow with the strange moustache came to power ... 
  he should appeal to the un human rights council ... s /, 
  to quote dr. house : `` people lie . '', 
  oh , right , because they would never lie or say what they believe the inquisitor expects to hear . 
  [ this literally came out a few hours ago ] ( http://www.tourism.government.bg/bg/kategorii/videogaleriya/bulgariya-e-myastoto ), 
  why should we have any tollerance , religious or not , for people who have none . 
  like i said when it was announce in august that we have the third highers road-mortality in the world - `` the year is not yet over , still time to top the chart '' . 
  right . 
  it was just a `` happy little accident '' . 
  after the victory he won the putinly cup , a recently established hockey award which russian media vehemently denies being a knock off of that other hockey cup . 
  you know what ? 
  i stoically refuse to believe conspiracy theoriests and yet the news is trying their hardest to proove them right . 
  the documents is simple enough to read and barely 12 pages long . 
  i guess the title is not perfect , but deleting on the grounds of bad source is just a clear case of censorship . 
  really ? 
  the official site of the eu parlament is not a credible source ? 
  huh . 
  tolerance - the new speaking out against the party . 
  pretty soon they will have re-education programs . 
  watch me soa-a-a-a aaaaaaaaaaaa, 
  this is serious , dangerous and cartoonishly hilarious . 
  omg , i always concidered the `` you 're so light , the wind will blow you away '' saying to be a hyperbole ... 
  useless waste of money and resources . 
  when they get a 100-150 k per boat they can just buy two-three more and still be in the black . 
  well , we funally opened the second lagest trash recycling station in europe . 
  it is expected to provide between 8-12 % of the country 's gas needs . 
  yey eu money !, 
  `` the rebels '' - just like yuri bezmenov said - useless idiots that will get marginalised or removed if they resist . 
  what they actually fought for most likely was never planned to happen and they were just a tool . 
  really !, 
  omg , you wo n't believe who helped start volkswangen . 
  edit : omg !, 
  i just realised something - see , the whole scandal means tha vw was gassing the planet . 
  get it . 
  old habbits die hard . 
  floppy discks ? 
  what is this space technology ? 
  i still write my code on punchable paper . 
  despite the whole `` fuck bulgaria '' media line of the putin regime , here are a few items : the russian government has not offcially declared the project closed . 
  it recently came to light that 3-5k sallary experts are still emplyed by the south stream project , despite it being put on hold . 
  some withnesses are reporting that the pipe-laying platform , visible from the city , is still moving and very much operational . 
  just recently it crossed my mind , that it must be the ultimate burn , having today 's lingua `` franca '' be english . 
  this is a good , civilised discussion . 
  alas both of them are gum flapping about the symptoms , not the causes . 
  look on the bright side , at least they are throwing grenades `` away '' , not throwing grenades `` at '' . 
  yeah , sweeden , i 'm looking at you . 
  russian mig , the kerug of fighterjets . 
  in one dystopia people are waiting in line for ages , caise there is none . 
  in another people are trampling over products to get to the promo one . 
  i think we 're a little beyond the pick the lesser evil dictator point . 
  even if assad survives it wo n't solve the current crysis and it might even further it . 
  orly ? 
  how about this - what would have happened if gaddafi hadbeen left to croak from natural causes ? 
  his son could never have been the ruler he was , the opposition would have started a heavy offencive and the country would have ended up exactly where it is . 
  name one russian product that is n't an ore or a fossil fuel and people would actually pay for ... 
  cough ... ukrane cough ... 
  you are arguing about the monuments . 
  count yourself lucky . 
  we here have living breathing communists in power . 
  just this week parlamet turned down a vote to study communist crimes and recent history .
