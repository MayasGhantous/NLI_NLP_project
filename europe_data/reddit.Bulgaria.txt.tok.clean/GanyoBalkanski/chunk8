  dude , they tired to assassinate poli pantev in 2000 ... with and rpg . 
  where 's bruno mars when tou need him ... 
  she 's a political henchman who 's brokered deals with mobster warlords in kosovo , iraq , albania and etc , which is kind of insulting . 
  but she has yet to star in a tv-series , unlike her predicessor , so thre 's that . 
  personally i do n't like her . 
  there was a criminal case where a roma boy was accused of sexually abusing a mentally deficient girl from his school . 
  faced with the very real prospect of the prosecution doing jack with a side of squat , people from that town organisded a protest . 
  keep in mind that the protest was strictly people from that city , not the usual football holligan/bikers that pop up at such events . 
  the protest was held in the city centre and later in the outsckirts block where the roma live . 
  the roma were afforded full police escort , despite the the protest being peacefull . 
  some of the roma tried provoking the protesters , including waving knives showing firearms ( almost certainly illegal , given the ownership lawa here , but it was disreguarded by police , here in the interest of not escalating the situation ) . 
  the protest dispersed , because the atendees said they respect the law and refused to fight the bulgarian leos . 
  her excellency appealed for ethnic tollerance , integration and mutual respect , like in the us . 
  [ just a few days before ] ( http://nypost.com/2014/11/27/cops-release-video-of-officer-fatally-shooting-12-year-old/ ) , in the us , cops barely out of a cruses opened fire on a 12-year old ... 
  i 'm glad she 's leaving . 
  ... and the payroll trolls , whose favourite insult is eurogay , just went ape-shit crazy . 
  thanks , juna !,

  in fact there is no mafia . 
  people are just wise and world-weary . 
  actually , in soviet times arts were abundantly funded and promoted ... and censored acordingly .

  game here for this comment . 
  was not dissapointed . 
  wait , does that make greecethe creerleader ? 
  `` since 387 bc , france has fought 168 major wars . 
  they 've won 109 , lost 49 and drawn ( or as close as you can `` draw '' a war ) 10 times . '', 
  mist likely yes , but it will firm a great rift internally . 
  the upper echelon priesrhood - most certainly . 
  when comunism came to power though , all religion became a taboo . 
  almost all of the priesthood became state security agents ( the kind you get volunteerd for ) and people who still visited churches had a black mark on their dossie . 
  my grandfather and grandmother wated for the cover of night and snuck in plainer clothes in the church to get their religios marriage . 
  as far as abortion - the medidical procedure became known and massuvely practiced after the regime came . 
  before that is was visit the village witch for abrew . 
  dunno about other countries , but here is was stigmatised and considered amoral , like prostitution , but it was also performed in most hopitals , reason being - if the mother does n't want the baby , at least le it be removed wirh the minimal danger for the mothe mother . 
  also , there was the social planning - in the perfect commie society there were n't any orphans so . 
  [ donnie andrews ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/donnie_andrews ) , he even has a cameo on the show - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggju_jyfp70 0:50 the guy who enters the cell . 
  `` omar comming . 
  omar comming yo ! '', 
  nah , who are we kidding , putin is nowhere near as awesom as omar , who btw is based on real person . 
  abysmal is too harsh . 
  cromewell was abysmal , so was addie . 
  tsipras just missed the opportunity . 
  had he negotiated before the referendum , he could have gotten off easier , but decided to gamble and rolled snake eyes . 
  dear world , eastern orthodoxy is actually pretty swell . 
  we support science , eucation , civil partnership , divorce , even abortion and homosexuality up to an extent . 
  russian orthodoxy , right now , is the newfound puppet of the kgb pederasts . 
  they do not represent the views of all orthodox churches . 
   yes i ised a peace of art thet closely imitates life , instead of making a long post describing the same . 
  is that a problem ? 
  just search any newspaper site about bulgaria and human trafficking and you 'll find enough articles about beggars being sold between the clans in different countries . 
  ask anyone who is in the central streets in the morning and they 've all at least omce seen the latest mode german suvs dropping off beggars at key locations . 
  many people here have given up on on givin mery . 
  a more common solution used to be is to drag the begging kid to the nearest bakery and buy them food , but now most of them straight up refuse because their handlers punish them for not taking hard money . 
  as for the baby trade - remember a few months ago when the greek police went ballistic because they found a blinde , blue-eyed kid , who spoke bulgarian , in a gypcy katun . 
  well it turns out rhe kid was a gypcy and all the other kids from the mother are like that , and they fetch a pretty price too . 
   nomadic or not , my point was exactly that they are n't discriminated against severely and their marginalism , if any , is self-imposed . 
   gypcy or roma is a broad term that exists from one end of the continent to the other end . 
  while they do havi similarities and often travel around , they are many differences too . 
  like english , american , australian and new zealand people - they come from mostly the ame place , share a language , but are different too . 
  first off - concider that roma in the uk reffers to irish and roma in bulgaria means indian roma , so you are asking about a sundry group . 
  the way gypcies are treated in the us today is probably the way they were treated in bulgaria in the begining of the last century . 
  they were a `` free-spirited '' traveller group who preffered to be on the margin . 
  their traditional occupations were : party musician , bear trainers , ambulant vendors , metal workers , sharpeners , coppersmiths , tinkers and etc. 
  in that period ( 1880-1930 ) bulgaria was experiencing a compressed version of the modern period and all social groups were rapidly adapting . 
  when the comunists regime came in the 40s that process was halted and heavy industrialisation was forced against the market forces . 
  this left a lot of the gypcies without occupation and forcefully marginalised by the party policies . 
  today gypcies handle pickpocketing , the beggar mafia ( see the first part of slumdog millionare for refference ) , the baby trade , counterfeit alchohol distilieries and counterfeit cigaretts . 
  also , bride selling , but that 's a more complicated topic . 
  yes , there are educated ones who want to integrate - many of them are employed in construction or the agrarian sector , but generally they do not get publicity . 
  my oppion on the matter - like the saying goes `` every heard has its carrion '' . 
  also , sadly , resistance to integration is present from both sides . 
  as far as experiences - a guy died in the apartment building i live in and some time later a gypcy family mooved in . 
  they only lived for about a year and later it became known that they never actually purchased the place .
