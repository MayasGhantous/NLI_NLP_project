the money should be decent enough for bulgaria but there is not that much work for chemical engineers and most of the job postings require experience . 
  *** for many people spending a 3 months salary on any one thing is not justifiable . 
  but as i said , there are plenty of people that are relatively well-off ( or their parents are well-off ) , especially in the bigger cities . 
  they can spend 1 or 2 months salary on a pc , iphone , imac as a present for a birthday , name day , christmas , whatever . 
  others can always buy something on lease or get a small credit or a loan / family loan . 
  all of these options are pretty popular and that 's how many of the cars that you saw were bought . 
  of course there are also plenty of people who buy things when they have the money , even if they ca n't really afford it ( i 've done that ) . 
  people ( young ones especially ) want things , justified or not and they always find ways to get them , legal , illegal or with family help . 
  * edit : * i forgot to mention that there are many people who work in western europe ( some for a couple of months , others only come back for holidays ) and send money to their families in bulgaria . 
  this however , creates some problems . 
  their kids are left with little or no supervision . 
  often the grandparents take care of them but elderly people have a limited capacity to control . 
  from what i 've seen in high school , young people in such cases kinda get out of control , which some may say is not that bad . 
  but not a small number of them ( mostly from the turkish minority and especially from the roma minority ) have great difficulties in school , some graduate only because * everyone * graduates ( even if you 've missed more than 80 % of the classes ) , while others drop out entirely . 
  so , when they 're finished with school ( one way or another ) most just follow in their parents ' footsteps and the cycle continues .

  there also seems to be a lot of paperwork and regulation involved in a highly bureaucratic country like bulgaria . 
  ah man , i really appreciate the thought but there is no need . 
  tomorrow ( march 3rd ) is a national holiday so we get a four day break and i 'll have plenty of time to cook something . 
  and if someone is interested , here you can see the holiday dates in bulgaria for this year - http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/bulgaria/ there are plenty of national holidays . 
   family member doing driving instruction is probably the fastest way for a family conflict . 
  not in my case . 
  my grandfather is a very good and patient man . 
  he 's still an active driver at 72 after nearly 40 years of driving experience . 
  there are some but i have no idea how useful they are . 
  i should look into that . 
  the service sector . 
  i 'm sending cv 's for all kinds of jobs . 
  but i do n't think that a stressful job can be nice . 
  i would prefer to stay for now while i have the time to try different jobs . 
  maybe i 'll find something that i really like doing even if it is n't well paid . 
  and if things get really bad i can always go somewhere and try my luck . 
  if you did n't stop reading there you would 've seen that a few paragraphs later i said basically the same thing , only without the patronizing part . 
  i have to leave for work now . 
  if you have an unanswered question i 'll get to it when i return home . 
  i should 've mentioned that i have driven my grandfather 's car for close to 14 hours total . 
  we started on an empty grass field then some dirt roads and finally moved to backroads . 
  if i have to drive in a straight line without needing to change gears , things are fine but as soon as i have to change gear or make a simple turn ... let 's just say that my inadequacy starts to show . 
  besides , getting a driver 's license , a car , maintaining it , repairs and so on costs money which i neither have nor wish to spend on a car . 
  also , the 55 minute walks are very rare , on average i walk for like 30-40 minutes a day , so i do n't feel like getting a bicycle is necessary . 
  quoting my reply to another comment . 
   actually i tried going for a computer science major first but just as i thought , math and physics turned out to be huge obstacles for me . 
  it 's embarrassing to say but one of the reasons i chose european studies ( es ) after that was because there are no math courses and the closest thing to it were the economics courses which i barely passed . 
  the good thing is that i actually liked es , enjoyed it and learned much . 
  you 're right .

  the industry is the second largest sector of the economy and i would say that there are enough engineering jobs . 
  in fact there is a shortage of engineers .

  i 've thought about that . 
  maybe there is a chance that i have a mild case of adhd but as far as i know diagnosing is really hard and besides i do n't have even one of the adult adhd symptoms . 
  maybe she meant 18k bgn a month which is around 10k usd . 
  that was some time ago and i am forgetful but still , i 'm pretty sure she said usd . 
  i am sending out cv 's for such jobs but no one is going to hire me just like that with my lack of experience . 
  i had to choose between assembling boxes and sending cv 's while being unemployed with a growing hole in my work experience and a dwindling bank account . 
  all i know is that it is some kind of a hotel management job . 
  and she is not that young ( couple of years older than me ) and has worked in switzerland since turning 18 .

  thank you for the kind words . 
  speaking of programming , i 've tried to get into it several times throughout the years but it 's just not my thing . 
  i do like 3d modeling however . 
  a month ago i got back to using blender and i 've been working on a project every day . 
  it 's really enjoyable . 
  i 'm also starting a new job tomorrow , ( in production again but this one is supposed to be better paying ) so i 'll see how that goes .

  spreadsheet explanation *** in the top left corner you can see the amount of money that i 've allocated for this month . 
  it 's equal to the minimum salary in bulgaria as of january 1st 2016 . 
  right next to it is the money left in my bank account which i hoped i would n't have to use so soon ( in the formula bar you can see the amount i had before going over budget ) . 
  the monthly bills are in light purple . 
  i pay them ( excluding the building service tax ) using a bill paying service so there is a small tax for every payment . 
  you can see it if you click on a cell in a bgn column and check the formula bar . 
  and here is a bit of information ( you can see it as notes in the spreadsheet ) about every expense type , followed by some clarifications which i feel are necessary . 
  ### electricity * price for kwh during the day is 0.15 bgn ( 0.08 eur ) and 0.06 bgn ( 0.03 eur ) during the night . 
  * last year i started using an electric oil filled radiator for heating . 
  before that i was using a ( n ) wood stove with radiators which is cheap but not really a good option if you live in an apartment complex . 
  i still have firewood in the basement , most of which was turned into dust by [ powderpost beetles ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/powderpost_beetle ) and even two basement floods did n't stop them . 
  the bill for this month is the highest i 've ever had to pay . 
  last month it was 91 bgn ( 45.52 eur ) . 
  normally during the spring , summer and autumn it 's between 43 bgn ( 21.98 eur ) and 53 bgn ( 27.09 eur ) . 
  ### water * the price is 1.90 bgn ( 0.96 eur ) for 1 cubic meter of water ( 1000 litres ) . 
  * the water here is really cheap and generally safe to drink but it 's not really recommended . 
  there is also no hot water in my building so i have to use a water heater . 
  ### internet + tv * the price for 60mbit/s ( 7.5 megabytes ) internet + 75 channels tv is 19.72 bgn ( 10.08 eur ) . 
  * the speeds are good , the reliability is excellent and it 's cheap . 
  also depending on the isp you can even get lower prices and/or free internet for a month or two a year thanks to promotions and whatnot . 
  sadly , there is not much competition anymore compared to a few years ago but it 's nothing like in the us or australia , which is nice . 
  ### phones * monthly payment for 2 phones ( me and my mother 's ) is 18.40 bgn ( 9.41 eur ) + usage which is usually in the range of 3.00 to 11.00 bgn ( 1.53-5 .62 eur ) on a basic plan .
