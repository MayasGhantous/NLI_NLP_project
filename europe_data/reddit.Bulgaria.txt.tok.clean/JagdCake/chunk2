  * i barely make calls and when my mother is outside of the country she uses mostly facebook and emails for communication . 
  concerning cell phone carriers , now there is more competition than ever before but i ca n't really tell you much more about them due to my very limited experience . 
  ### building service tax * 8.00 bgn ( 4.09 eur ) + 2.00 bgn ( 1.02 eur ) usually collected every month . 
  * 8 bgn is the standard service tax for my building . 
  it 's used to pay for the general maintenance and cleaning services . 
  the 2 bgn is for repairs and improvements ( mostly repairs ) . 
  in dark purple are the things i spend money on in my day-to-day life . 
  ### transport * money spent on taxis and public transportation . 
  * i do n't have a car nor a driver 's license for that matter . 
  i do n't like driving and i do n't think i 'll make a good driver . 
  so , if i have to go somewhere not too far away , i walk . 
  if there are decent sidewalks 55 minute walks in one direction are my limit . 
  naturally i 've seen enough shit to make me double check for cars in every direction on a quiet one-way street with a pedestrian crossing and a green light . 
  if i do n't know where someplace is and ca n't orient myself using google maps , i get a taxi or get on a bus / trolleybus . 
  and as you can see from the spreadsheet i do n't use a bus every day because most of the time one of my co-workers can use the company car to pick me up and drop me off . 
  ### household * groceries , laundry supplies , cleaning supplies , toilet paper , going out for a beer , etc. 
  * what i 'm buying regularly is food and water . 
  i do n't even touch junk food and very rarely eat fast food . 
  i cook when i have the time , mostly on the weekends . 
  i try to make enough to last me a couple of days and then go full sandwich mode until i have time to cook again . 
  all i drink at home is water , some tea if i have a cold and beer when i go out which happens once a week . 
  i do n't drink coffee and since cheap juice is basically flavored water i seldom buy some of the expensive stuff . 
  ### entertainment * mainly money spent on video games . 
  * ( see `` savings goal '' ) ### other * this includes everything else really , from taxes and fees to clothes , shoes and home improvements / repairs . 
  * every expense in this category can be seen as a note in the spreadsheet . 
  specifically for clothes and shoes i spend more money so they can last me a couple of years . 
  there is no rent category because the apartment that i live in was left to me by my father and i live alone so 98 % of the money that i spend is on me . 
  the weekly spending part shows only the money spent from monday to sunday on a given week . 
  i think that everything else is self-explanatory . 
  background *** i 'm 24 years old , graduated in september last year from a bulgarian university after writing a bachelor 's thesis on `` the islamic state and its influence on the european muslim communities '' , my major was european studies and multilevel governance , faculty of business and management . 
  my real work experience began in july when i took part in a month and a half long paid internship at the regional administration in my city . 
  after that , thanks to some work that i did as an intern i was offered an hourly job at a non-governmental organization . 
  i was hired to complete a specific task which took me a month . 
  then , still at the same ngo i did some miscellaneous work like creating a budget template covering the specific needs of my employer , some work on eu projects , compiled some surveys , etc. 
  when the work dried up however , i was let go . 
  afterwards , my first real job hunt began . 
  i was already registered at the national employment agency and i also started sending out cvs for various office , warehouse manager , technical assistant kind of jobs . 
  basically , things that i know i 'll be good at , comfortable and most importantly confident doing . 
  almost 3 months passed , got 2 interviews but no luck . 
  the thing about such jobs is that , at least in bulgaria : - there are n't that many of them even in a big city like the one that i live in ; - they are popular and are generally seen as easier than the alternatives like all the different kinds of physical work , retail jobs , production and so on , which are the type of jobs that most of the parents of the 18 + year olds do . 
  these are predominantly low-paying jobs and let 's not kid ourselves , they are also not very enjoyable . 
  this leads me to my next point ; - in bulgaria there is this huge emphasis on the family in contrast to , let 's say the us . 
  the parents ( most of whom have a high school education ) of today 's young people do everything in their power to provide for their children and push them to earn a degree so they can get an `` easy '' job driven by the bulgarian proverb `` if you study , you wo n't have to work '' ( paraphrased ) . 
  the kids see how hard their parents have to work a `` shitty '' job , how miserable they are and they sure as hell do n't want that for themselves ; - higher education is cheap and if you do n't care much about grades it 's not that hard to complete . 
  university became the new high school . 
  there are many people with more marketable majors and/or more experience competing for one position ; so , since trying to find an `` easy '' job could 've taken me even more months and my bank account was dwindling i decided to find myself a `` shitty '' job , one without much competition . 
  and i did , i wrote my first ever motivation letter , sent my cv and 2 days later i got a job interview on the phone . 
  at this point i still did n't know what the job entailed exactly , so i was invited to check out the workplace , a workshop . 
  i can describe the working conditions as decent , but they sure could be better . 
  the job is , officially , assembly laborer , it includes [ die cutting ] ( https://goo.gl/fhlf4q ) paper and cardboard that is used in the making of [ `` luxury boxes '' ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=luxury+boxes&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjmvpjzhffkahxfjswkhz5fc4uq_auibygb&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=955 ) and assembling said boxes , if there is nothing to do on the die cutting machines . 
  now , i have to confess that i am kind of slow . 
  on my first day i die cut ( ?? ), 
  2000 sheets of paper in 8 hours out of the 4800 ( at least ) that i normally have to cut to fill the quota ( 600-700 sheets an hour ) . 
  in the first 3 days of the following week i got better but was still failing to meet the quota and on the 2 days after that i was doing assembly work which as it turned out , i was better at . 
  and here is another example of my slowness , writing this post took me 25 goddamn hours in the span of 12 days . 
  the reason for that could be that for a long time i 've struggled with putting my thoughts into words but i do n't know . 
  current job woes *** the first thing that annoyed me was that i was told to buy myself an employment record book which the employer is required to issue since i 'm starting a job with an employment contract for the first time . 
  [ ^ 1 ] ( http://www.bulgaria-labour-law.bg/seniority.html ) they confirmed that this is true but `` it is n't practiced '' . 
  when i went to the national employment agency to unregister ( it 's necessary to unregister if you start a job ) i asked them about that and they told me that 's just `` the way some employers are '' . 
  i told myself `` whatever , in bulgaria that 's nothing surprising '' , so i bought it . 
  before that , on my first day , a colleague told me that there are cameras and i should refrain from picking up my phone unless it 's an emergency , because if the bosses see me , there could be consequences . 
  during the first two weeks all i could see when i looked around were motion detectors . 
  in the third week however , when i looked from up close i saw a small ip camera [ ( similar to this one ) ] ( http://www.subaquaimaging.com/images/sais-ip-cam.jpg ) tucked behind one of the detectors . 
  what irked me about that was that i was n't told officially about the cameras and there was n't a specific clause in the contract about them but when i checked what the law says concerning video surveillance in the workplace , i found out that this is n't really illegal . 
  according to bulgarian law surveillance recordings are a form of personal data , video surveillance is an act of personal data processing [ ^ 2 ] ( https://www.cpdp.bg/en/?p=element&amp;aid=424 ) and i 've signed a declaration stating that my employer has a right to process my personal data . 
  what really rustled my jimmies was when i was told that if i want to receive my salary i 'll need to open a bank account in a specific bank . 
  some employers `` force '' people to do that primarily because they can save money that way and if they have an agreement with the bank they also get some more benefits while the benefits that the employees get ( at least in that specific bank ) are the same ones you get for having a simple debit card . 
  this is n't ill\u0435gal either but the labour law allows me to write a request letter to my employer asking to receive my salary in another bank . 
  i 've read that the employer can not decline such requests but i find that hard to believe . 
  there is room for interpretation in that law and it is just a request letter and a request can always be denied . 
  there are also some other things which i do not like but i learned about them from hearsay , so i 'll stop here . 
  reasons *** + u/kim _ jong_un4 's thread ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/45o5vj/is_eastern_europe_as_bad_as_people_say/ ) ; + i love making spreadsheets , coloring the cells , arranging the data , formatting . 
  and there is so much purple because i also love katy perry ( not so much after she showed her support for hillary ) ; + this post is a byproduct of the spreadsheet and it helps me get some things off my chest ; + i want to reliably track my savings goal ; # 5 . 
  savings goal *** i play video games on pc , this is what i do , my main hobby . 
  i also dabble in gimp , sfm , programming , blender in the past . 
  i 'm not very good at them but i try . 
  if these things count as hobbies , they are the other ones , all of them centered around my computer . 
  so , my goal is to save enough money for a zen + polaris pc build ( 1400 bgn / 715 eur ) till the end of the year . 
  i want to support amd and being relatively poor helps make that choice , especially since i 'm not aiming for 1080p , 60 fps in the latest games . 
  as it stands i do n't see a way in which i can save enough until then to be able to afford it . 
  that 's why i 'm counting on finding a better paying job in the coming months . 
  there is also something else that i ca n't afford - video games . 
  well , then you may ask how am i playing them . 
  years ago my answer would 've been simple - piracy . 
  i wo n't argue that it 's right , it is not , or that it 's a necessity , again it is not . 
  but entertainment is important , if piracy did n't exist , sure as hell my life would 've been dull and depressing . 
  i 've largely moved away from it in the past couple of years . 
  8 year ago i bought my first 2 games , 5 years ago my first steam game tf2 and thanks to the introduction of trading , some good people and a lot of luck i made some nice profits and used them to buy a good chunk of the games i 've played . 
  i also bought some during sales using money earned doing the occasional odd job , got others from humble bundles . 
  i got windows 8.1 for free through my university , all of the software that i use is either free or trial . 
  but , for movies , tv shows and some of the newest games that i ca n't afford at the moment , i still pirate . 
  some positivity *** anyway , i guess i should mention that if you have the brains , education and ambition you can make a pretty good living in bulgaria . 
  i know a girl that got a marketable degree from a swiss university and is now working from home making 1800 bgn ( 920 eur ) ( she says the money is not enough for her but that 's another thing ) while studying in a bulgarian university full-time , earning a second bachelor 's degree so she can go to qatar and get her promised job with a salary of 18k usd ( it 's possible she meant bgn ) a month . 
  in the bigger cities there is more work , more opportunities and higher wages . 
  for example , the average monthly wage in sofia , the capital of bulgaria is 1075 bgn ( 550 eur ) . 
  [ ^ 3 ] ( http://bnr.bg/en/post/100562445/average-monthly-salary-in-bulgaria-reaches-eur-400 ) overall there are also more internships and training programs available . 
  and the minimum wage did get increased from 380 bgn ( 194 eur ) in 2015 to 420 bgn ( 214 eur ) in 2016 . 
  [ ^ 4 ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/172365/bulgarian+cabinet+approves+increase+of+minimum+wage+to+bgn+420+in+2016 ) if you 're interested [ here ] ( http://www.kik-info.com/spravochnik/mrz.php ) you can see the growth of the minimum wage throughout the years . 
  rant *** i 've heard some moderately successful people say that if you 're making shit money that is probably because you 're stupid or you 're not working hard enough , not trying hard enough and so on . 
  that may very well be true but even if you are such a person who has a job , does decent work but maybe has zero ambition , do n't you at least deserve enough money in order to have a decent life ?
