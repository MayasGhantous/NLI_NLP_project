  i remember you had a few more about bulgaria . 
  something regarding our money , if i 'm not mistaken . 
  next level booty call . 
  anyone who draws a dick on the moon is pretty alpha in my book . 
   just crazy frustrated people with no lives looting oil rich territory and capturing sex slaves sounds pretty ottoman to me . 
  then it 's a good thing that christians are n't required to follow the talmud . 
  better yet , build a coliseum !, 
  right vs left , no rules , 10 thousand spectators , battle to the death !, 
  think of all that delicious tourist revenue this would bring to the city . 
  in what regard are they `` fighting '' for human rights ? 
  what kind of actions have been partaken to save human life in north korea , china or the middle east ? 
  profoundly crying ( a.k.a. 
  raising awareness ) does n't do jack to elevate anyone 's suffering . 
  nothing a few prayers wo n't fix . 
  i say go for it . 
  heterogenious nation states ? 
  heh , let 's see how long that lasts . 
  there was nothing to refute in the first place . 
  your first link was simply throwing blame around , without even trying to address ** why ** x is the way it is . 
  it even had a few blatant lies in there for good measure ( children being assigned to special aide classes based on ethnicity ) . 
  any real study on the roma as an ethnicity would have cared to mention that : 1 . 
  they live in ghettos because they choose to . 
  they do n't send their children to school , because they see no use for it . 
  they are n't trusted by the rest of the populace , because they are notorious when it comes to petty crime , assaults and some , usually their `` kings '' , are pretty big players in the organized crime scene . 
  since it failed to do so and only focused victimizing gypsies as much as it can , calling it `` biased '' and disregarding it completely is more than justified . 
  your second link focuses exclusively on roma evictions , insisting the countries should disregard their laws regarding private property , just for the sake of gypsies . 
  putting a group of people above the law on account of their race , is by every definition , ** racist ** . 
  if you were honestly an opponent of discrimination and racism , you would n't be linking such a website in the first place . 
   this joke of a conversation . 
  your right , this conversation is a joke . 
  you have n't contributed anything substantial to it and your mental gymnastics are abhorrent . 
  i 'm done wasting my time on it . 
  reply if you want , i wo n't read it . 
  maybe they got a whiff of soros along the line . 
   first link an empty leftist hogwash article filled with nothing but projection . 
  `` oh , boohoo romas live in ghettos , they 're seen as untrustworthy and they do n't send their children to school . 
  clearly everyone else is at fault except the group in question . '', 
  only someone who has n't been in contact with gypsies would take something like this seriously . 
   second link good old amnesty . 
  always there to cry when countries try to uphold their law , by removing ghettos from private property or try to force gypsy children to attend school like everybody else . 
  and always silent whenever gypsies steal something , rape an old lady or engage in clan warfare . 
  i 'll give you credit for not linking the helsinki committee 's website , i would have frankly burst in laughter if i saw that . 
   you 're the one who now made this about skin colour , well done . 
  no , you 're the one who made it about skin color the moment you started crying about discrimination and racism , while equating an entire continent to nazi germany . 
  i just called you out on it . 
  it 's clear now why you do n't feel why poles should be recognized as national minority in germany . 
  they 're not ** your ** preferred skin color . 
  [ and for good reason . 
  you 're not making any sense . 
  you asked an unrelated question , gave an unrelated answer and finished it off with an idiom . 
  and what is this so called discrimination that those poor romans experience on a daily basis ? 
  are they denied work ? 
  are they denied the right to vote ? 
  healthcare ? 
  education ? 
  back your claims with some facts instead of throwing around buzz words while boasting how smart you are . 
   and by the way , a polish dude in germany will benefit from the same laws that protect the roma guy from discrimination . 
  then why not make it official and give them minority status as well . 
  if the framework is already there , it would literally cost you nothing , to recognize poles as a national minority . 
  that is , unless they 're not brown enough for you to pass as a minority . 
  what 's your point ? 
  i bet putin is laughing his ass off while watching this shitfest unfold . 
  the majority of football fans . 
  i do n't even know someone who watches sports in general `` for the company '' . 
  drove from blagoevgrad to thessaloniki last sunday . 
  felt like i was in silent hill . 
  nothing wrong there . 
  i would enjoy a film about sobieski . 
  india that 's just embarrassing . 
  and why is that ? 
  they got to germany the same way as the gypsies and there are plenty of german born poles . 
  why does one group get status and the other does n't ? 
  historically ? 
  yes . 
  today ? 
  probably not . 
  then what would you call [ this ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/sites/default/files/styles/involucra_large/public/refugees_welcome_berlin.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/germany-opens-its-gates-berlin-says-all-syrian-asylum-seekers-are-welcome-to-remain-as-britain-is-10470062.html ) ? 
  tell me more about those 2 million poles in germany , who are all immigrants . 
  perhaps there was a refugee wave i missed . 
   poles are not a recognized national minority in germany , the roma very much are . 
  and that just reaffirms that germans cherry pick who to be apologetic for . 
  that 's cute . 
  we 're nursing a 5th generation of failures as we speak . 
  what 's so dysfunctional about british society that it needs african/asian migrants in order to fix it ? 
  glorious slav genes to the rescue . 
  yes , and not just policemen . 
  the populace in general . 
   even if that were the case , who gives a shit ? 
  if all the social science students actually accused policemen involved in those crimes of being racist , that does nothing . 
  they have no political influence . 
  why should the police care ? 
  they get attacked and insulted at many demonstrations by way more people , that does n't concern or worry anybody . 
  you underestimate how wimpy and spoiled the average first worlder is . 
  emotionally they 're so fragile , that simple name calling could have very serious implications on their psyche . 
  school must have been a blast for him . 
  apart from using words you do n't know the meaning of , it seems to me like you 're living on a different continent . 
   christianity came after european culture as well , so to say that it 's the foundation is laughable at best . 
  christianity came before the formation of most european countries and was the pillar on which nations build their own cultures . 
  it 's not the foundation of `` european culture '' , since such a singular concept does n't exist , but it was the foundation of many of the many european ** cultures ** that grace this continent . 
   the legal systems bare very little resemblance to christian ` laws ' .
