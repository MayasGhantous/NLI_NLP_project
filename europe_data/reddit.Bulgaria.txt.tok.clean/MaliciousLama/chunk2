  if both parties try to accommodate each other , i think that we should be able get along just fine and prove the doomsday scenarios wrong . 
  i love democracy : ), 
  i do n't see how anyone can argue against this . 
  they were made for each other . 
  yeah , my bad . 
  i just checked that they are n't a member , but have an observer status . 
  still , comparing people 's opposition to circumcision to `` racism and intolerance '' is disgusting . 
  what pisses me the most is that the fuckers have managed to guilt trip germany into supporting this disgusting practice . 
  and why the fuck is israel even in the council of europe ? 
  wow , russia . 
  you should n't have . 
  this is too much ... 
  in bulgaria it 's same with the added bonus of gypsies throwing stones at the windows . 
  meanwhile switzerland and italy are building 50km tunnels through the alps . 
  fml, 
  i would n't worry too much . 
  migrants already make a significant portion of the population and are both younger and have a higher fertility rate than ethnic norwegians . 
  their treasured multicultural society is n't going anywhere : ), 
  first of all this is not art . 
  this is defacing a war memorial dedicated to the millions who died fighting against fascism in ww2 . 
  it 's an insult to their memories . 
  shit like this would n't be condoned in any self-respecting country . 
  second we did what moscow told us to do . 
  if someone should apologize it 's them . 
  i swear someday i 'll find some of these fuckers who think they have the god given right to scribble their shit on every monument and every building there is and i 'll break their fucking arms . 
  what do you expect from countries where the median age is 40 + ? 
  it 's gon na get even worse . 
  us gov being paranoid and scared again . 
  wan na switch ? 
  i do n't hate them , but i wish they would just disappear . 
  if you think germans are rude , you should meet koreans . 
  we are actually in the middle of the graph ? 
  just do it already and find yourselves a new scapegoat . 
  you mean national stereotypes are not always true ? 
  some deep journalism from the bbc . 
  just remember , do n't fuck with the rich . 
  there was once a government who tried to eradicate europe 's upper class by making the common people hate them , calling them rats and exploiters ... and look what happened to them ... 
  they are now remembered as the most vile people to have ever existed . 
  in case you were wondering why this particular genocide in human history is the most well remembered one . 
  seems legit ... 
  * most trustworthy : germany * least trustworthy : greece * most arrogant : britain * least arrogant : austria * most compassionate : bulgaria * least compassionate : germany, 
  i thought the british government paid in pounds ? 
  east is nothing more than going really far west . 
  i like the wild west : /, 
  it 's staggering that people do n't really know anything about a person who governed for 40 years what was of the world 's ten most powerful countries . 
  since his departure from politics italy has only lost influence and power . 
  rip . 
  i hate that dumb fuck borisov so much . 
  may be it 's because they always get 10 times the media attention they deserve . 
  i do n't know about the best description , but [ here ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y2vh41a.jpg ) 's a stereotypically eastern european one from sofia , bg . 
  please come back to bulgaria . 
  i think i might still have a spare nuke in my grandma 's closet . 
  retards . . 
   which means she 's awful and should ** have ** never ~ ~ of ~ ~ been hired either . 
  she is a morning talk show host and is obviously trying too hard , but she is usually much nicer . 
  there is also a difference between being hired and elected :3, 
  where did i say he was a nazi , you idiot ? 
  i kinda agree with his sentiments , but he is being a dick about it . 
  he 's simply jumping on the next-new-thing-to-hate-about-the-eu-membership bandwagon to gather political support . 
  also you complain about the uk looking like a `` foreign marketplace '' while you yourself are a foreigner . 
  hypocrite . 
  the point is that farage opposes all immigration to the uk while he himself is a descendent of immigrants . 
  i also do n't agree with the tone of her interview , but she uses the same type of hyperbolic , pompously indignant language farage uses in the eu parliament . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:europe_subregion_map_un_geoschme.svg : ), 
  if you need to import people to fix your toilet why are you surprised that your economy is in the shitter ? 
  yes , americans are very nationalistic . 
  nothing new under the sun . 
  i mean hell , they even make kids say an oath of loyalty to their country every school day . 
  what does east berlin have against led lights ? 
  from which branch of the government do they come from ? 
  human or drug trafficking ? 
  brb enjoying german prison . 
  well they are 10 % of the population of bulgaria , but relations are n't bad . 
  there is still a bit of resentment about the ottoman empire and some separation between the bulgarians and turks in some areas , but in the bigger cities no one cares from my experience . 
  i guess things here are also helped by the fact that it 's taboo to talk about your religion with people whom you do n't know extremely well . 
  the right thing to do in my opinion would be to divide kosovo with the north remaining in serbia , but i feel that would be almost impossible . 
  it could trigger a lot of shit on the balkans . 
  for the people thinking you are joking : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al7o9f0so1o --  video of a `` bride market '' from bulgaria . 
  good to see that the greek finance ministry has been spending its time dealing with relevant issues . 
  i for one am relieved that you have n't brought up the topic of possible reparations from the destructive bulgarian occupation of byzantine land in the 7th century . 
  these activists may leave an impression on some people , but putin is not among them . 
  yeah , i know . 
  i 'm just teasing . 
  but you see my point about the subreddit . 
  there are at least 20 comments arguing to your comment about whether or not romania is balkan . 
  imagine someone says macedonia or kosovo . 
  it 's a bad idea . 
  lol , look at him . 
  when did romania become too good for the rest of us ? 
  you may have less of it , but you still got the taint , comrade : ), 
  / r/balkanpolitics ? 
  that 's the worst idea anyone could have thought of . 
  til : opening a university and an embassy in bosnia = return of gentle ottoman empire . 
  such power . 
  someone hold me before i collapse in awe . 
  do n't editorialize the title !, 
  the article mentions exactly one sentence about ** rumors ** of support from wealthy shipowners yet you 've put it here like it 's a fact . 
  i hate it when people do that as if guardian articles are not speculative enough . 
  get owned, 
  `` germania est delenda '' .
