nope , not taken seriously at all . 
  which is getting on their nerves and they are becoming more and more desperate . 
  there was a large rock ( kinda if you ask me but ... ) concert here last year and a bunch of those idiots came with posters and started shouting at the crowd about us being devil worshipers and shit . 
  it was probably the same this year but i personally did n't go to this year 's concert . 
  do n't forget ireland :p, 
  i 'm not surprised to be honest . 
  traveling around europe , it 's noticeable that there are indeed a lot of people that could loose a kilo or two . 
  drinking and smoking - i 'm not so sure . 
  i mean for someone who does n't drink or smoke , anything is above average . 
  that said , i 've managed to loose 15 kilos this year so i 'm not contributing to the negative side anymore . 
  good call , thanks . 
  fixed . 
  i do n't really understand sweden in these maps . 
  iirc , the s. has been the largest ruling party in sweden for the past 100 + years . 
  was n't the ndp like the grand-daughter of the nazi party ? 
  like the nazi party evolved into the reich party and then into the ndp ? 
  i could be wrong but for some reason that 's what i remember . 
  ah , no job offer then , back to school !, 
  i know but spotting someone 's incompetence is a skill . 
  the rest can be taught . 
  if a kid manages to make this kind of damage to a large telecom here ... 
  i 'd personally hire him/her . 
  not joking at all . 
  drama sells , that 's it . 
  that makes it dramatic . 
  for many people ( those bad at math for instance ) , the non linear scales are nothing short of witchcraft which makes this extremely dramatic . 
  not really needed : refugees already know what 's waiting for them here so they 'll probably bail long before they get here . 
  it 's sad but it is true : we are racist as fuck . 
  why do you care ? 
  as soon as they see how we treat refugees , they 'll start running towards where they originally came from . 
  oooh ... 
  i 'm sorry , norway is not on our menu ( might be kind of illegal you know ) . 
  how about a beer instead ? 
  so finland is n't good enough either ? 
  welcome to the club guys , what can we get you ? 
  oh come on !!!, 
  cameron 's wife is far not a supermodel but calling her a dead pig is a bit of an overkill .

  it wo n't disappear , worst case scenario , it will spend the rest of it 's life in my living room . 
  you are right though but i do n't know anyone who does these types of service around these parts . 
  i travel to germany 5-6 times a year so i might try there but just the thought of carrying this around frightens me . 
  nah , i 'm not talking about the few extra letters , more like the expressions and certain words . 
  there is a section about common diseases and treatments . 
  you need to read every paragraph at least 6 times to figure out what the hell it is about . 
  otherwise there 's tons of stuff - poets , scientists , there 's our entire constitution from the time which is around 200 pages . 
  there 's a full list of all the lawyers , major land owners and all sorts of other stuff , including some addresses ( which kind of makes me wondering if any of their properties still exist in one way or another ) . 
  i know about one or two in sofia aaaaaaaaaanyway ... you asked for it , some of the political and economical sections of the book ( international and local ) . 
  spirit - there is n't much ( except the part about louis pasteur ) , it 's mostly a lot of tables with data : [ click here for more fun ] ( https://mega.nz/#!s1b2qj7r!2oigkbndec4zb005ormxorifdxia1s8vikur912kbea ), 
  crap , i just noticed . 
  edit : 1896 , i messed up the title , sorry :( i 'm trying to bring a breath of fresh air in a time when refugees and immigration accounts for 70 + percent of the posts in / r/europe . 
  a few years ago my grandfather asked me to take care of his book because he believed that only i would take care of them as good as he had . 
  that was about a week before he passed away . 
  and i am taking extremely good care of them . 
  among thousands of books , there were some from my grandfather 's grandfather . 
  basically a lot of really old and rare books from the 19-th century are now standing on the shelf in my living room . 
  and this particular one used to be my grandfather 's favourite . 
  not because of it 's age but because of the 1400 + pages of statistics from around the globe . 
  mine too for this exact same reason actually . 
  i guess the love for numbers runs in the family . 
  i wo n't even attempt to translate it but i 'd be willing to give it my best shot for the parts that are most interesting . 
  and if anyone wants to give a hand , let me know . 
  to be honest i find it extremely difficult to understand ( the language has evolved over the past century and a half and i am really struggling ) . 
  it contains tons of information about the constitution , the people in government , production , imports , exports , political status of many of the important countries , there 's even a 12 page biography of louis pasteur . 
  the book does n't say much about the author but whoever wrote it surely was pasteur 's biggest fan . 
  so just to give you some idea ( this would be the last picture ) : ** chapter i ** general statistics about the entire world . 
  the entire land area , calculated at 135,473,568 square kilometers has a population of 1,497 million inhabitants : | | inhabitants | area in square km | | ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------- | | europe | 365 million | 9 695,339 | | asia | 828 | 44,163,017 | | africa | 169 | 29,817,944 | | america | 129 | 48,354,765 | | australia | 5 | 8,956,039 | | polar states | 82 thousand | 4,486,564 | the average lifespan of a human life is estimated to be 33.5 years . 
  a fourth of the newborns die by the age of 7 and almost half by the age of 40 . 
  only 6 in 100 reach the age of 60 and only one in 500 reaches the age of 80 , 1 in 1000 reaches 100 . 
  every year 33 million people die and therefore 96 thousand each hour , 3730 each hour , 60 each minute and 1 each second . 
  42.5 million are born each year , thus the population increases by 9.5 million each year . 
  on average , there are 825 thousand marriages each year . 
  i own two properties : one here and one abroad . 
  bulgaria has two types of properties : those in the 2 or 3 large cities ( especially the capital ) and all others . 
  let 's start with the simple option : all others : very cheap , you can basically buy a mansion for close to nothing . 
  you might need to invest some more in reconstruction and this is where the fun begins . 
  the countryside is very underpopulated . 
  it mainly consists of really really really old people so the reconstruction process as well as spending any time there might be a bit of a problem . 
  basically your best companion might turn out to be a squirrel or some other animal . 
  time in the countryside has stopped . 
  it may be a nice getaway but it can get ** very ** depressing if you spend more time there . 
  the capital : you are in a world of shit . 
  first off , forget all the ads you see . 
  i bought my flat around 4 years ago and it took me 8 months to find what i was looking for , despite the thousands of ads listed . 
  and i was n't picky at all : +100 square meters , terrace and a view . 
  and i was considered `` lucky '' . 
  as soon as you call the estate agent , you will hear something along the lines of `` awwwww , the flat was sold just 2 hours ago , i am on my way back to the office and i am going to remove the ad as soon as i get there . 
  either way we have a lot to offer so just tell me what you 're looking for and i 'll see what i can do '' . 
  needless to say , two months later , the pretty pictures will still be there with no indication that the property is not for sale anymore . 
  so be prepared to spend some time looking around . 
  the other thing is that the prices have gone through the roof over the past few years . 
  to give you an example , back in 2011 , my 123 square meter flat set me back around 100,000 euros , including furniture and everything . 
  at this day and age , given the location , the condition ( and the fact that a subway station popped up 200 meters away from my flat ) , the price has gone up to around 150k . 
  on the bright side , sofia has nothing to do with the place it used to be 20 years ago : parks have been fixed , the center is great ( took some time but hey ) , lots of young people and all that . 
  but it 's noticeably becoming a bit too overcrowded . 
  according to statistics , the capital is standing at around 1.3-1 .4 million . 
  however since the state allows you to move to a different location without having to register at your new place . 
  may people do n't bother at all . 
  +70 % of the people do not bother , which is probably adding another million to that number . 
  so you 'll see a lot of people who work in sofia but `` live '' 400 km away . 
  the city was never intended to be this big so many people are looking for alternatives ( properties in villages close to the city ) .
