not only that . 
  my parents say * i should n't hesitate to go abroad * and that i should * get away from this country * , while some teachers say that * we are the future of this country * . 
  i do n't even know what to think . 
  uh . . yes . 
  not only does our country have huge immigration but also death rate ( young people , not just the elders ) . 
  we have one of the highest car accident rates and etc. 
  if we can take care of the death rate maybe things could stabilise . 
  i get depressed when i think about it too . 
  i feel guilty . 
  i 'm young i aim to study abroad and i ca n't think of a reason why would i go back . 
  i love my country but i have no future here . 
  ahh yes . 
  i see what you mean . 
  you are completely correct . 
  the thing about macedonia being bulgarian is from vmro from the early 20th century which wanted unification with bulgaria in order the macednian bulgarians not to get split between serbia and greece . 
  but thats all . 
  macedonia has aways been an awkward place . 
  so many cultures when through it . 
  and today . . 25 % of the population is albanian . 
  things are getting weired . 
  now i feel bad if i sounded rude . 
  i 've seen these two facts about oldest country and city and i have no idea where they come from . 
  i 've never been told these and yet 90 % of `` top ten facts about bulgaria '' , be that articles or youtube videos , tell them . 
  the other thing which people tend to confuse is the glagolic alphabet with the cyrilic one , which is outrageous . 
  it 's taught in 5th grade for god 's sake . 
  the cyrilic alphabet truly was developed in bulgaria , it 's a historical fact . 
  it 's like doubting that ww2 was a thing . 
  however a lot of bulgarians claim that the glagolic alphabet was also made in bulgaria which is completely untrue . 
  that 's where the confusion comes from . 
  and to top if all off , a lot of people really think today 's macedonia is ours . 
  in reality , macedonia before 1945 was a territory inhabited by bulgarians as a majority . 
  bulgaria really did have legitimate rights to this territory . 
  but today this is absurd . 
  macedonia as we know it today is not what what is used to be , yet people are stubborn and spam social media and even argue irl about how it 's `` rightfully ours '' . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  another disgraceful theory is : `` the great chinese wall was build because of the bulgars '' . 
  it 's just pure crap . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that i understand where your distrust comes from and i can relate . 
  people have a hard time differentiating pseudohistory from actual history . 
  it 's sad really . . bulgaria is a great country with rich history . 
  we should be proud with what we have . 
  people should be patriots , not chauvinists . 
  the situation today is understandable though , taking into consideration what the country want though ( two national catastrophes and 45 years ussr influence ) . 
  i now understand that there is no way i could convince you other wise . 
  and even if i try you will probably think i 'm just another brainwashed nationalist protecting my dignity . 
  the only thing i have to say is : you are wrong , pessimistic sir . 
  you are deluded by hate as much as the brainwashed bulgarians you just described , only on the opposite side of the patriotic spectrum . 
  just one more thing . 
  macedonia does n't belong to bulgaria , very true . 
  after the failure of the ilinden -- preobrazhenie uprising it was decided that it would be better if vardar macedonia was it 's own independent country , rather than part of mainland bulgaria as that would bring even more distortion to balkan politics . 
  but saying that macedonia has nothing to do with bulgaria is just plain wrong . 
  i 'm certain that you 're confusing macedonia with macedon . 
  and please , if you feel like responding to this , do n't just say `` you 're brainwashed , ignorant like the rest and yada yada '' . 
  prove me wrong with a legitimate answer and facts behind your statement . 
  good day . 
  sorry for taking me 11 days to reply . 
  anyway , i really appreciate your comment and i see what you mean but i 'm an optimist and i 'm sure things will get better . 
  people tend to confuse being optimistic with being naive , sadly . . 
  ahh i should 've used * spelling * . 
  i just forgot the word when writing . 
  the letters were called elitist by the socialists because they were better suited for the western dialect and the west part of bulgaria was better developed ( bourgeoisie and all that ) + the capital sofia . 
  a factor in all of this is the that the majority of the population was peasant . 
  the letters have some extra rules to them , when to be used , not the typical sounds-letter pattern . 
  and to know when to use them properly you need education and education was n't developed . 
  so when the socialists came they took out the letters saying they were old bulgarian symbols of chauvinism and elitism . 
  the whole thing was done so that the bulgarian alphabet would be closer to the russian one . 
  i see what you mean . 
  what i tried to say is that the aim of this change is based on hostile intentions rather than modernization . 
  the same happened in bulgaria . 
  the spelling was simplified in 1945 to fit the socialist agenda . 
  you call bulgarians ignorant and hateful yet you show ignorance yourself . 
  yes , what you said about history being altered is true ( and what your mum had to do is well known to have been common practise ) . 
  during the socialism people truly were fed lies , and during the 90s this continued because after the fall of the socialist regime an inferiority complex emerged and all kinds of distorted theories poped-up praising our past . 
  however this is no longer the case . 
  things have changed in the past 10-20 years . 
  chauvinist propaganda is looked down upon . 
  the newer generations are n't as ignorant and hateful as some might think and even people raised during the cold war have faced the facts . 
  the hate towards turks is complex as there 's a difference between mainland turks and bulgarian turks . 
  meanhile the hate towards the world in general is now irrelevant . 
  this hate you speak of is the aftermath of the older generation having a negative mindset towards the western world . 
  but now things are n't like that . 
  tolerance is at all time high , factors are the eu and mostly proper education . 
  the only people who stick to ridiculous and exaggerated theories about how bulgaria is superior to the rest of the world are the radical nationalists/chauvinists who are still quite loud in today 's press . 
  but you should n't base your opinion of a few rotten apples . 
  in a nutshell , yes . 
  in bulgaria there 's the thing called the [ `` yat border '' ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_dialects# ) ( the second picture ) . 
  it seperates the west and east bulgarian dialects . 
  they were different in pronoincing the article defining certain words and even used a different vocabulary for some words . 
  after the socialists took over , in 1945 they [ reformed the bulgarian language ] ( https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;nv=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.bg&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://bg.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25d0%259f%25d1%2580%25d0%25b0%25d0%25b2%25d0%25be%25d0%25bf%25d0%25b8%25d1%2581%25d0%25bd%25d0%25b0_%25d1%2580%25d0%25b5%25d1%2584%25d0%25be%25d1%2580%25d0%25bc%25d0%25b0_%25d0%25bd%25d0%25b0_%25d0%25b1%25d1%258a%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b3%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d1%2581%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b8%25d1%258f_%25d0%25b5%25d0%25b7%25d0%25b8%25d0%25ba_%25d0%25be%25d1%2582_1945&amp;usg=alkjrhgrbwu8z0w1cgqhx8mkorc6ediskq ) and based it in the eastern dialect while macedonia stayed with the western . 
  that was one of the ways they split vardar macedonia from bulgaria besides altering history . 
  bulgaria was soviet puppet during the cold war and agreed to take part in the macedonisation and creating a macedonian identity ( georgi dimitrov 's rule ) . 
  our socialists had an exteme anti-bulgarian policy . 
  they were more dedicated to ussr than to their own country . 
  they voted for us in eurovision so i guess thing are getting pretty serious . 
   borrowings from many languages ( yes , including serbian ) i would argue that this was more of a forced modification of the native dialect rather than a borrowing . 
  what i 'm talking about is vuc karadzic 's alphabet becoming a standard and the inclusion of \u040f \u040a and \u0409 during yugoslav times . 
  before that the bulgarian alphabet was widely used . 
  this change is considered as a hostile differentiation of the macedonian dialect from bulgarian rather than a part of the natural development of the native macedonian dialect/language . 
  true . 
  i do n't know why croats study it in school to this day,
