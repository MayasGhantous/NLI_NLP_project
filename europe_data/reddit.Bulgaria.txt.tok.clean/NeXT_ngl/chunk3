  reeeeeeeeee, 
  that one figure in russia 's territory reminds me of the meme [ `` i 'll beat a motherf * ker with another motherf * ker '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rgrjugl.jpg ), 
  so meta, 
  [ ww2 bulgarian anti-bolshevik poster : `` this is what europe could expect from bolshevism '' ] ( https://image.prntscr.com/image/d4r4ahkgs4otgdks-xehqa.jpg ), 
  [ y u bully me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny0qsmvuu6k ), 
  i do n't know what i expected . . amazing . 
  story time ? 
  [ ackchyually ] ( http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/191/035/135.png ) sorry , i saw a meme opportunity . 
  i love comment sections like this so much . 
  gives me a good laugh . 
  bulgaria ca n't into commonwealth, 
  [ bravo sir ] ( http://www.lovethispic.com/uploaded_images/17967-audience-clapping-gif.gif?1 ), 
  that 's what a robot would say, 
  the bulgarian split makes no sense . 
  and serbia should be divided into three , like the three regions it consists of . 
  what standard ? 
  what was like living there , what makes it unachievable ? 
  thank you for the replies . 
  is that good ? 
  what exactly is `` hate crime messages '' in youtube and facebook ? 
  does isis have an yt account or something ? 
   this is actually a constitutional offence . 
  it violates the current constitution . 
  what about that ? 
  is erdogan eager to change the constitution ? 
  here we see a young , rich ( probably the son of the leader of the mafia ) , gopnik boy with his peasant servant , lighting a cigarette in front of the big city . 
  an absolutely stunning photograph . 
  every time i see a picture of santorini i have to urge to go there with a paintball gun . 
  it 's just so white and clean . 
  whoa . 
  that 's awesome . 
  i genuinely understood that . 
  thank you . 
  aww yiss . 
  ultra high-quality chalga . 
  dream come true . 
  i would say every country with developed nationalism has a greater x. 
  it 's not just a balkan phenomenon . 
   mostly nothing read / u/zmeiotpirin 's comment above . 
   it took three bulgarians to press that save button . 
  i do n't get it . . 
  not even mad , that 's genuinely funny . 
  i 'm a bit curious . 
  i must ask : is a single satellite capable of multitasking for the whole south east europe ? 
  and , who financed this ? 
  bulgaria 's population in 1989 - almost 9 million . 
  today - 7.18 million, 
  yes , the truth always hits me in the feels . 
  the choice we have to make every 4 years : the mutra , the red witch , the united chauvinists/alt-nationalists , erdogan 's secret service, 
  your prime-minister got kicked out while we elect the same mutra every election . 
  it 's something . . 
  it 's a feature ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  you see . 
  we had a `` little '' prank ( gone wrong ) in prague in 1968 . 
  and we kinda participated heavily in it . 
  and we want to make up for it . 
  we really are sorry . 
  this is awkward . 
  of course we are bros. . we 'll always be . 
  i 'm up for it too . 
  czechia has great beer , architecture and . . ladies . 
  that 's nice . 
  fighting over past history is futile and not to mention stupid on the internet :d . i lived 3 years in beograd and people were very nice and hospitable . 
  i have great memories of those times . 
   why you always backstab and pick fights with us ? 
  we 've moved on alright , you can be sure of that . 
  my question is , have you guys moved on ? 
  thank you for the great explanation . 
  the usual . 
  thanks . 
  alright then . . 
  thanks . 
  what happened ? 
  i got downvoted and all of us got marked . 
  i was just asking , i 'm aware of russia but there has to be more to it so i ask . 
  there 's a reason i put `` just asking '' so people do n't get triggered and do n't think i 'm some russophile . 
  react to what ? 
  nato was formed in order to counter ussr aggression , right ? 
  today , what is its purpose ? 
  i never understood that . 
  the video shows a diverse , well trained army , but who are they to fight against ? 
  just asking . 
  every time there 's a post ( or a video ) about medieval and renaissance times , they show this map . 
  it hurts . 
  thanks for the explanation . 
  the battle of doiran is on the 22 of april until the 9th of may . 
  man , why do people have to be so harsh . 
  we 're poor . 
  we know . 
  no need to rub it in . 
  we have our reasons , mostly corruption and badly handled transition from socialism to capitalism . 
  corruption and low quality education . 
  and the economy ofc .

  why i disagree with them is quite obvious . 
  foreign influence . 
  plovdiv seems quite nice . 
  the old part of the city is lovely and it 's the 3rd ( i think ) biggest city so there are job opportunities . 
  893 to 927 is the period of the bulgarian golden age and the rule of simeon the great . 
  after the ottoman occupation i would say the periods of knyaz alexander of battenberg 's rule and tsar boris iii 's rule .
