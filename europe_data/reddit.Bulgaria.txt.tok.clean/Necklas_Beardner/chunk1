that _ is_cheap . 
  in bulgaria a domestic 0.5 l is ~ $ 0.7 . 
  for a good beer you pay ~ $ 1.3 edit : nevermind i thought it was $ 0.3 for a beer . 
  so basically same prices as here . 
  we _ did _ celebrate 100 years of independence ... 6 years ago . 
  it 's got euro written in cyrillic but bulgaria is n't in the eurozone . 
  guess that settles it - the lev 's days are numbered . 
  you 're almost right . 
  this is actually a frame from an animated spinnig globe which was not meant to be examined in detail . 
  the person who did it did n't bother to put the correct names probably because he was instructed to just make it look good and the details are n't important . 
  he was most certainly not a geography entusiast so this is the final result . 
  ** bulgaria ** * [ floods in varna municipality ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27935436 ) took at least 12 lives . 
  two children are still missing . 
  it is the deadliest natural disaster in recent times . 
  * one of the largest banks - ktb is facing bankruptcy . 
  after special police forces invaded their offices people went on a bank run and currently the bank is under protection from bnb ( bulgarian national bank ) . 
  they have ran out of liquidity and all transactions are frozen for the next 3 months . 
   the hell ? 
  help !, 
  bulgaria . 
  it is common here and in turkey . 
  do i win ? 
  [ comme un chef ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1911553/ ) ( the chef ) 2012 - france . 
  from the imdb description  a veteran chef faces off against his restaurant group 's new ceo , who wants to the establishment to lose a star from its rating in order to bring in a younger chef who specializes in molecular gastronomy . 
  i was n't expecting much , just a lighthearted comedy but it 's really an awesome movie . 
  you should definitely check it out . 
  ** dessert ** is a typically sweet course that concludes a meal . 
  a ** desert ** is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life . 
  not sure really . 
  you need to contact the bulgarian embassy in norway . 
  our country is easy on tourists and immigration so you 'll have no trouble getting in . 
  bulgarian weather offers something for everyone . 
  with full four seasons we have cold winters with lots of snow on the mountains and it 's a very popular affordable skiing destination . 
  the summers are hot and the beaches are beautiful . 
  definitely visit in the summer and if you enjoy clean and uncluttered beaches there are plenty of them outside of the popular resorts . 
  springs are amazing , everything 's green and in my opinion it 's the best time to explore the mountains and older villages . 
  customs - there really is n't anything you should worry about . 
  most young people speak english and can be very helpful . 
  the majority are christian and we have a turkish minority ( ~ 9 % ) but we really are n't that religious . 
  basically all you need to do is stay out of trouble and you 'll have a great time here . 
  just do n't take it personal when vendors and cashiers seem rude . 
  they are n't rude it 's just the way they appear . 
  it 's kind of normal here . 
  do n't expect smiles or even hello . 
  bulgaria is a really interesting country when it comes to the price of goods and services . 
  restaurants , alcohol , cigarettes , transportation , theatres , amusement parks , landmarks access , etc are very cheap compared to most western european countries . 
  but goods in the supermarket and clothing are sometimes even more expensive than what you can find in germany for example . 
  so basically it 's a great tourist destination . 
  if you have more questions ask right away . 
  everyone in europe who has had an encounter with a gypsy has a negative opinion about them . 
  people who live near gypsies simply hate them . 
  but you first need to know which gypsies are we referring to . 
  when americans and most people in the first world hear about a gypsy they are picturing [ this ] ( http://images.halloweencostumes.com/products/7017/1-1/deluxe-tarot-card-gypsy-costume.jpg ) . 
  when in reality gypsies look like [ this ] ( http://newobserveronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/gypsies-sliven.jpg ) . 
  almost all of them have committed at least one crime . 
  they do n't pay taxes , electricity , housing , etc. 
  they build illegal houses near towns and villages and constantly rob them . 
  they have many kids because governments in europe pay for child support . 
  the kids do n't go to school and are on the streets begging . 
  in corrupt european countries they are used for their vote . 
  they usualy give them a beer and something to eat or 20lv ( ~ $ 11 ) . 
  are you that afraid of the feedback that you put / s just in case you have to explain yourself ? 
  do we really need to pretend to be politically correct when there 's this huge fucking elephant in the room ? 
  really ? 
  weird , i was in romania a few years ago and i saw i think a couple . 
  granted it was smaller towns - negru voda to mangalia . 
  i remember them because they were a lot more colorful than ours . 
  decorated with all kinds of stuff . 
  old dacias were like that also . 
  is it some sort of a tradition there ? 
  not really . 
  gypsies do n't care at all about their horses . 
  i 've seen many malnourished and obviously abused horses owned by gypsies . 
  they eat whatever is around them and pull that cart until they drop dead . 
  a used car need constant maintenance and fuel which costs _ a _ _ lot _ for a gypsy . 
  many hard working bulgarians ca n't afford a car . 
  edit : wrong reply . 
  i do n't get it . 
  who oppresses them ? 
  their government is your standard eastern european corrupt government but they were n't oppressing anyone . 
  and then we have these `` terrorists '' out of nowhere shooting at people and everyone 's protesting now . 
  how convenient . 
  but for who ? 
  i 'm not being cynical here , pretty bad stuff happened and it should have been avoided but you have to agree that something 's off . 
  so it 's generally not a good beer ? 
  maybe i like it because it tastes differently from most beers i consume . 
  i like most czech beers that can be found here and starobrno is definitely on top of the list . 
  * as someone who has experienced the convenience of the bicycle in holland 's urban areas , sometimes i wish it was a bit more flat around here . 
  not to mention 30 % of it was an ad . 
  are n't youtubers making enough money off the views anyways ? 
  i 'm sorry but 30 % of the video was an ad . 
  and it was n't _ that _ interesting video to begin with . 
  fun fact : \u0428\u043e\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 is just a marketing name . 
  it 's not some traditional bulgarian salad . 
  it was promoted to tourists during the `` golden age '' of communism . 
  it caught on and now it 's the most popular salad . 
  we bulgarians have lots of different dishes , meat , sweets , etc but even we refer to most grilled meat as `` srabska skara ( \u0421\u0440\u044a\u0431\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430 , literally serbian grill ) '', 
  yeah i know . 
  i was referring to another border which had control . 
  do you have more info on the road you posted ?
