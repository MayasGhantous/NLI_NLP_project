i mean , historically , yes greeks hate bulgarians . 
  let 's not forget how fondly greeks think of the bulgar-slayer . 
  not too many people really care at this point . 
  i think / u/piulau 's point is that today , out of all of greece 's neighbors , bulgarians are the least distasteful ( to them ) . 
  ( and by the way , ` vulgar ' is also a word in english , and there 's a french word as well . ), 
  yeah , it 's funny how that works !, 
  i reckon we 're probably turkey 's favorite neighbors as well ... 
  there 's a reason they call us komshu . 
  if you look back at the disintegration of the ottoman empire , the larger european countries pushed for small balkan states . 
  they did n't want to have a competitor rise up in the balkans , so they really pushed hard for smaller countries and supported nationalism and different identities to prevent that from happening . 
  in the end , yugoslavia failed because of those nationalist flames fanned by other european countries in the 19th century . 
  haha no worries - i consider people similar to me even when i do n't like them . 
  in fact , it 's often the people most similar to me that i do n't like ... [ romania and bulgaria trying to fit in with the uk ] ( http://i.imgur.com/o4qihqo.png ) - also kind of fitting when reading about the libyan soldiers in the uk ... 
  eh , the question was which countries are most * similar * , not which ones do we like the most . 
  i would honestly say that bulgaria shares a lot of similarities with all of its neighbors . 
  ** romania ** - similar character of people/holidays ( martenitsa/martisor ) . 
  ** serbia ** - not sure i even need to comment on this . 
  bulgarians and serbians really get along on an individual level . 
  it 's once you get to some organized groups ( football fans , national armies ) that we get antagonistic . 
  ** macedonia ** - even the languages are similar ( mutually intelligible ) . 
  also , many historical figures are shared by both nations . 
  ** greece ** - this is probably the toughest , as greeks never seem to want to be * like * anyone , and out of all our neighbors , they look down upon us the most . 
  but still , similar religion , similar holidays , similar dances - it 's very easy to find things in common with greeks . 
  ** turkey ** - the amount of common words in bulgarian and turkish is a lot . 
  like , a lot a lot . 
  more than most bulgarians realize . 
  i think there is a stigma to saying that bulgarians and turks are similar because of the ottoman occupation ( we call it slavery in bulgaria ) and the religious divide ( christian vs muslim ) . 
  but if you get past those , talking to turkish people and visiting people in turkey is almost like looking through a looking glass at a different version of bulgarian society . 
  we 're very alike in many ways . 
  so my vote goes to ** romania ** - i think we 're the most similar in character , and the most similar in economic and cultural development at the moment . 
  kind of have been tied at the hip for the last 15 years , honestly . 
  edit : wtf it 's my cake day . 
  i think people have been saying that russia will collapse since the end of wwi . 
  pretty sure no one expected russia to live past wwii . 
  russia 's gotten the last laugh pretty often last century , actually . 
  speaks volumes about the people , that they can keep going despite foreign invasions/sanctions and local government ineptitude . 
  did n't we just see how people think the number of muslims in their country is a lot greater than what it actually is ? 
  perception and reality are often not the same . 
  not sure why he didnt add 8 of the eu countries , but i put them in a comment : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2kripf/where_not_to_invest_in_europe/clo54do, 
  just in case someone was wondering about other countries who happen to be in the european union as well ( assuming this is what the list is trying to portray , as there are no non-eu countries in it ) : country | ease of doing business rank | # of years taken to enforce a contract | # of years taken to resolve insolvency ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ | bulgaria | 38 | 6.25 | 3.18 estonia | 17 | 2.67 | 3.09 finland | 9 | 1 . 
  42 | 0.09 hungary | 54 | 1.67 | 5.33 latvia | 23 | 1.33 | 3.33 lithuania | 24 | 1.18 | 5.69 malta | 94 | 9 | 7.09 romania | 48 | 4.25 | 3.82, 
  fun fact - a division of the bulgarian army was occupying the aegean coast when the soviet army entered bulgaria . 
  the commanding general decided on his own to retreat back to bulgaria . 
  if he had n't and had continued occupying it , i doubt stalin would have let that bit of land go back to greece . 
  hahaha took a second to recognize them spelled with roman letters !, 
  you are right . . 
  thanks . 
  20 years ago everyone was thinking about regime change . 
  no one is thinking about regime change now , they have some more space left over in their head for these thoughts . 
  better comparison is to ask whether gender equality in the 1970 's was on people 's minds . 
  and it was . 
  also , you can not compare the bulgarian communist party to hitler and the nazi party . 
  just , no . 
  ouch , did n't realize you had a 10 % threshold . 
  i wonder who all those syrian refugees will vote for if they get turkish citizenship ... and yes - peevski ( man in the photo ) is the visible part of the whole underbelly , the tip of the iceberg if you will . 
  and if he 's just the tip , imagine how big the rest of that nation-sinking , parasitic layer is . 
  latest fiasco is who drained ktb bank of 4 billion , where it went . 
  rumor has it peevski is a big beneficiary of that . 
  well , yes - but he was trying to make fun of bulgaria . 
  which i understand , he 's frustrated with political landscape . 
  gerb - mafia party # 1 bsp - mafia party # 2 dps - mafia party # 3 rb - inept reformists with child-like behavior who ca n't manage their own coalition/parties abv - flip flopping party out to become mafia party # 4/some populist tendencies pf - populist party # 1 ataka - populist party # 2 the problem here is not whether women are in politics or not . 
  we 're not even at that step to make sure they are fairly represented . 
  we 're at the step of representing the people at all . 
  right now , we 're just riding the coattails of communism when it comes to gender equality . 
  gender equality is not something we learned from the ` west ' . 
  there have been large pushes for gender equality during communism as well . 
  just because it is a ` thing of the past ' or ` russian colonialism ' or ` one party dictatorship with few freedoms ' does n't mean there were n't some good things about the regime . 
  the push for gender equality is definitely one of them . 
  yes , they happen to be leaders of parliamentary groups and are present at high level talks aimed at forming a government . 
  therefore , bulgarian women are included in politics . . 
  though more would be better . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  it 's a forced attempt at making fun of bulgaria . 
  quick count in the new parliament - 45 woman delegates ( could have miscounted ) . 
  speaker is also a woman . 
  yes , it can be more . 
  it is still about average for women in europe 's parliaments as a percentage . 
  also plenty of people want to sit next to the turkish party ... 
  it 's an easy way to make money . 
  my parents lived in east germany . 
  it 's true . 
  hm , okay . 
  did you happen to watch music idol bg some years ago when macedonians participated ? 
  at first it was kind of strange hearing it , but after an episode or two you just kind of get used to it . 
  sounds like bulgaria ... 
  except we just vote ourselves into not having a government by not giving anyone a majority . 
  hm , i grew up in sofia - maybe some of the regionalisms come more naturally to me . 
  but for example : http://www.mia.mk/mk/inside/rendersinglenewsnewscategory/409/132345541 i have no problem understanding this . 
  do you ? 
  where are you from in bulgaria ? 
  i can understand  90 % . 
  old church slavonic is actually old bulgarian . 
  there used to be a lot of transfer from bulgarian to other slavic languages 1000 years ago . 
  recently , say 1800s on , there has been a lot of transfer from russian to bulgarian - literature , arts , articles , books . 
  sure , that 's pretty common knowledge at this point . 
  still , there are plenty of denser population regions in europe than that area . 
  there 's other reasons besides density of population that so much investment is being poured there . 
  interesting . 
  seems like the investment is concentrated next to the developed regions of europe . 
  wonder if we 'll see that banana push eastward in the next decades .
