  i think it depends on which serbs you talk to . 
  online troll serbs regularly spout crap about bulgarians . 
  i 've had some tell me to go back to mongolia . 
  serbs i meet in real life are great and we get along fine . 
  i leave my dogs with the serbian couple who lives down the corridor from me . 
  same with bulgarians . 
  you get a lot of younger guys who have n't met serbs spouting crap about them . 
  i guess what people are most upset about would probably be macedonia , what is called here the ` serbization ' of macedonians and leaving behind political structures that to this day continue to call bulgarian history their own and regularly demonize bulgaria . 
  like i said , people do n't really care about it/aren ' t upset by it . 
  but it did change bulgarian 's perception of serbians as brother christians fighting against the ottoman empire to untrustworthy neighbors , and that feeling still persists today . 
  he 's not popular anymore , thank god . 
  this war really colored people 's perceptions of you ( that you would go to war to prevent two bulgaria 's from uniting ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbo-bulgarian_war not to mention stabbing us in the back again over macedonia after the balkan wars . 
  but for most people , that is ancient history . 
  we do n't really like or dislike you . 
  we used to think you guys were very progressive , and in many ways , we still think you guys are ahead of us in terms of democracy , for example . 
  but for young guys who focus on history , yeah , they do n't like you . 
  people here do n't really like or dislike anyone , to be honest . 
  we 're even friends with the turks and greeks ( although our news is really gloating over how much greece is failing right now ) . 
  devils advocate her - is n't that just you seeing the situation through your own lens ? 
  the imf has insisted that greece not implement any reforms until the full aid package is agreed . 
  edit : or sexit , 
  or he could be a european immigrant to the u.s. no need to be mean . 
  and yet , in bulgaria , all we have is gloating on the news channels about the greek crisis . 
  the `` proud greeks '' refuse all efforts to help them . 
  there 's literally going to be greeks coming to bulgaria for humanitarian reasons , and yet people here ca n't wait for greece to fail for some reason . 
  right , but an economy without liquidity ca n't function . 
  we ca n't sell real estate to pay for food every day , we need cash . 
  liquidity dries up very quickly if there is deflation , since people will just hoard the cash . 
  there is deflation in greece because of the combination of financial crisis and the lowering of pensions . 
  so greece very much needs the ecb and international lenders if it wants to keep liquidity high and stay in the euro ... 
  sure - but should n't price parity be achieved then ? 
  i sell it at 9/10ths , then my neighbor sells it at 8/10ths to undercut me . 
  now that we 're buying all this extra food , the price of food jumps to 5/10ths , and my cousin misho is now selling the food for marginally more than he buys it at 6/10ths , so the original 2 sellers need to sell it at around that price as well . 
  so , for both , scarcity and competition should bring the price of food to parity in greece and bulgaria . 
  can vats explain the price difference ? 
  so there is n't any check on the global financial firms other than laws from sovereign states ? 
  there are no treaties that say something like , `` if a country defaults on its loans , all creditors should be paid proportionally equal amounts ? '', 
  otherwise , there is no incentive for one creditor to trim the debt , since another can hold out and get their full amount back . 
  what do you mean by profiteering ? 
  if i go and sell food there for half of the costs of their food , how am i profiteering ? 
  i understand after a disaster selling bottled water at 3x its price to be profiteering , but that does n't really explain what you were saying . 
  so in reality , it is the imf and the lenders holding a gun to greece 's head , saying , `` you can reform , but only how we tell you to ! '', 
  i wonder if tsipras and varoufakis had a free reign to reform greece from the beginning how things would look now . 
  this is something that i do n't really understand . 
  it 's not like bulgaria is that far away . 
  buy truckloads of cheap food here , go across the border , sell it for a little more , and profit . 
  this is what the free market is supposed to do , find the true price of stocks . 
  instead , we see two neighbors , in the same economic zone , with no border in between , having drastically different prices . 
  where is the invisible hand ? 
  so we 're always getting dragged down to the lowest common denominator ? 
  should n't there be rules , or laws , that prevent that ? 
  do n't kid yourself either . 
  the balkans had a very rich history before the ottomans came . 
  you 're joking right now , but i can definitely see him being tsipras 's successor in a few years time . 
  your comment is pretty abrasive , to be honest . 
  you can have an opinion , but stating it like this , `` i think he ruined greece , '' is less abrasive . 
  not to mention the name calling in your comment . 
  say what you want , this guy clearly made an impression on all of europe . 
  let 's now see whether the europeans were correct in saying that he was the impediment , or whether the europeans were just using him as a scapegoat to justify not offering a better deal . 
  well , i was mostly thinking from the border areas near sofia . 
  the benefit is that you 're very close to home , and sofia really has a lot of growth and employment . 
  and i can understand if there is hate , we 've had a lot of wars against each other in the past 100 years . 
  yeah , there is a lot of bad blood between the two countries . 
  not sure why you would still hate bulgaria right now , though . 
  and yet there is a lot less unemployment in bulgaria than serbia . 
  i often wonder why we do n't have more immigration from serbia . 
  please explain how this is racism ? 
  i suspect germans would also be in favor of helping out greeks had they not been attacked so hard themselves . 
  it has been a terrible program , which has led to worse conditions now than 5 years ago . 
  are greeks supposed to be happy about that ? 
  i 'm not sure orgasm is the word you 're looking for ( that implies happiness to me ) . 
  i doubt you 're happy to pay greek debts . 
  bulgaria has made it illegal for greek subsidiaries to transfer funds to parent companies in greece without central bank approval . 
  the fact that you say that shows an inherent malice toward even unborn greeks who have nothing to do with this mess . 
  or maybe because irish people do n't want to sit by while a nation is impoverished by debt ? 
  greeks are accepting bulgarian levs in northern greece and coming to bulgaria to use them ... 
  he was referring to wwii and `` joining '' the germans . 
  though at that point joining the germans was more about not getting our cities bombed by them . 
  it 's the imf projection . . you can choose any countries you like . 
  just go to his source and click on back , and choose armenia . 
  why ? 
  your gdp per capita is slightly higher than bulgaria 's . 
  you 're skipping over 100 years of history . 
  for most of that time , the countries it ruled over were much richer per capita than turkey . 
  there are other circumstances that have led to what it is today . 
  the guy above me is arguing/implying that the economic legacy left by the ottoman empire is the worst out of the empires in the region . 
  usually , when people say things like that , they basically mean the mentality cultured in the empire is not receptive to economic growth . 
  in this sense , the economic mentality of the ottoman empire surely must have imparted these worst traits to turkish people as well ? 
  it is if you give the next government that money . 
  quick ally with us - we 'll take northern greece , you take the islands . 
  ( just jokes , in case needs clarification ), 
  you 're kind of missing the byzantine empire . 
  they spoke greek . . 
  yes , i think you are right . 
  from the [ official eurostat document ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6897702/3-01072015-ap-en.pdf/2bbb6946-d2ba-48e9-be57-4c226cd8f6c9 ) :  ** naturalisation ** is the process by which a state grants its citizenship through a formal act on the application of the individual concerned . 
  ** other ways ** of granting citizenship may include spouses of nationals , minors adopted by nationals and descendants of nationals born abroad returning to the country of origin of their ancestors . 
  i remember when bulgaria was getting blasted in the media for having an open door policy to citizens of other countries who had bulgarian ancestry ... well , we 're really letting them in . 
  808 citizenships , or 0.1 per 1000 inhabitants , granted in 2013 will really overwhelm the eu . 
  op , can you please include turkey and georgia , armenia , and azerbaijan ? 
  black sea european sea .
