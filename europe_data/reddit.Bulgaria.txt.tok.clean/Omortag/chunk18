  edit : in any case : are you pretending that north african and middle eastern people have not been part of the known world since the beginning of recorded history ? 
  this is a fallacy . 
  europe was also without electricity when colonialism started . 
  just because one country controlled another when electricity was invented does n't mean they would not adopt it . 
  do n't even get me started about internet . 
  yes , algeria did n't have internet before it was colonized by the french . 
  / s also , north african nations/people ran around naked before nato started bombing libya ? 
  edit : apparently / r/europe fully supports the colonizing independent peoples . 
  just do n't delude yourself that colonialism is a net benefit to the subject peoples . 
  democracies are not loosely structured anarchies that should respond every time the majority wants something . 
  there are laws and election cycles to change the people in legislative and executive power . 
  it is the courts ' job to prevent abuse of power meanwhile , not a mob . 
  there 's video evidence of ukrainian protesters driving tractors unto police lines , hitting police with sticks , many months before the police got violent . 
  i 'm not sure how representative those cases are , but you ca n't claim it was a completely peaceful protest . 
  that 's your error . 
  not a single living turkish person today conquered or enslaved bulgarians . 
  furthermore , turkish people themselves rejected the repressive regime of the ottoman empire as well . 
  your view is , once an enemy , always an enemy . 
  we 're better than that . 
  as humans we have the power to forgive , and to adapt to new situations . 
  guess what ? 
  turkey is now a bulgarian ally . 
  in fact , it is bulgaria 's ** key ** ally in the region . 
  demonizing them , ostracizing them , pushing them away on the basis of things that happened over a century ago only tells turks that * you * will never treat them as equals . 
  45 days ago you opened a thread that talks about how bulgarians are not treated with respect or as equals in the european union . 
  you are turning around and doing * the same thing to turkey and turkish people . 
  * the way that you are making your ** allies ** feel is a terrible strategic decision . 
  the bad part is that it is not just you , it is europe as a whole doing this to turkey , and it 's not right , it 's not acceptable , and it is terribly short sighted . 
  secular turkish society needs us right now , and europe is turning its back . 
  also , you have a very rosy view of bulgarian history . 
  we have committed our own crimes , just like any other people . 
  western values such as ? 
  `` invaders , enslavers , monsters . '', 
  - so were the bulgarians at one point . 
  we regularly raided the byzantine empire for ` slavic workers . ', 
  we invaded the lands we now live on . 
  monsters even more recently to the greeks and turks . 
  what makes us better than them ? 
  how many turkish people have you met and had actual conversations with ? 
  if historical baggage is your thing , you should hate greeks , russians , germans , serbs , romanians , etc. 
  yes , because then it was clear then how to get ahead in life . 
  now you actually have to think for yourself . 
  and the priority today is n't always having the cleanest streets or prettiest buildings , but actually giving people jobs , and goods to buy . 
  however , all this has done for most people is rub in their faces what they ca n't have , and give them unclean , unkempt places to live . 
  yes - but stability is n't rated as highly as freedom and democracy is . 
  so the us will keep supporting rebels against assad probably . 
  or , to be cynical , the us just cares that assad is out no matter what the human toll is . 
  just came from there . 
  are americans really so anti vaccinations ? 
  source : http://frontex.europa.eu/assets/publications/risk_analysis/fran_q3_2014.pdf  increased operational activity reduced the numbers of irregular migrants at the greek and later at the bulgarian land border with turkey . 
  numbers also show substantial displacement to the eastern aegean sea monthly detections of illegal border-crossing in the eastern mediterranean region by border section and the detections of migrants arriving with fraudulent documents on flights from istanbul since the beginning of 2012 ( graph ) and the q3 2014 number of detected irregular migrants by border section ( arrows ), 
  hey - just want to apologize for getting antagonistic . 
  could n't sleep and was in a bad mood last night . 
  and therein lies the problem of nationalism . 
  we 're fed some hoopla about how we 're better than other people , and thus reduce other people to 2nd class in our minds . 
  thanks nazi germany for helping us see how ridiculous nationalism is ? 
  bulgar as a word has turkic roots - meaning to mix . 
  bulgarians in ancient times , as today , really , were always a mix of people . 
  the bulgars came to the balkans , and mixed with the slavs and the local population , and formed bulgaria . 
  even today , we recognize that we 're the product of a vast mix of people , and we celebrate it all . 
  so similar ... 
  i think we should all celebrate our common cultural heritage . 
  there are plenty of greeks descended from bulgarians and vice versa . 
  and yes , i would include turkish heritage in that as well . 
  bulgaria would throw a fit - probably because there is a large turkish minority in bulgarian thrace , so we would be scared of secessionist tendencies . 
  edit : also , turkish naming tendencies really leave me confused . 
  bulgaristan , serbistan , etc. 
  but romanya ? 
  and then , macedonian republic , instead of makedonistan or makedonya ? 
  i do n't even know what albania 's is ... 
  we 're not good at quidditch . 
  we mostly like turkish people , except for our own minority turkish party , which is corrupt . 
  ( and internet trolls on youtube , apparently ) . 
  very few people in bulgaria actually care what happens in macedonia . 
  it was supposed to pass under the black sea to bulgaria , and then to greece . 
  but we pissed putin off enough ... 
  it 's a shifting perception thing , see . 
  in the 60 's and 70 's , western europe loved turkey for its anti-ussr stance . 
  now , turkey has been lumped into the ` islamic ' grouping ( unfairly , i might add ) . 
  i think turkey will be recognized as part of europe sooner than we think - especially if the old enemy in russia is back . 
  can you guys vote in a pm who is good at economics and foreign policy ? 
  as well as secular ? 
  and preferably invests massive amount of money in bulgaria ? 
  edit : anyway , no , bulgarians were n't some holy angels , i agree . 
  we did our fair share of bad things . 
  you just really got me mad when you launched into a tirade on bulgarian actions during wwii when the topic was macedonia , and the balkan wars subsequently ( which i address in the original reply down below ) . 
  if we had gotten along from the beginning , it all would have been much better . 
   -- start of original reply . 
  basically , bulgaria , serbia , and greece had a plan to divide the spoils of war set in place before the first balkan war . 
  in exchange for bulgaria engaging the bulk of the ottoman troops in southeastern thrace , bulgaria would get the lands of macedonia , which were majority bulgarian populated . 
  however , because the bulgarian army was tied down in south eastern thrace , the greeks and serbs `` repudiated important particulars of the pre-war treaty and retained occupation of all the conquered districts in their possession which were to be divided according to specific predefined boundaries . '', 
  furthermore , even * before * the first balkan war was concluded by a peace treaty , the greeks and serbs promised to protect each other if bulgaria came looking after the land that was promised to it prior to the first balkan war . 
   ( wiki source again ) `` greece and serbia settled their mutual differences and signed a military alliance directed against bulgaria on 1 may 1913 , even before the treaty of london had been concluded . 
  this was soon followed by a treaty of `` mutual friendship and protection '' on 19 may/june 1 , 1913 . '', 
  if that 's not a betrayal , and an act of war , i do n't know what is . 
  ** at that point , greece and serbia were legally occupying bulgarian land , according to signed treaties , and they refused to remove their armies . 
  off topic and should be down voted . 
  read the andrew carnegie report on the balkan wars and then tell me that the bulgarians came even close to anything the greeks or serbs did . 
  we should come up with a name that involves the balkans , anatolia and caucuses together . 
  maybe an emigrant that lives in columbia and has become radicalized ?
