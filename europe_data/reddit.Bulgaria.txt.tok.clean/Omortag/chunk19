  i know bulgarian american kids on the internet are super nationalist compared to bulgarians in bulgaria . 
  i actually have no idea if there was ice cream back then in bulgaria . 
  there was probably no refrigeration at the time , but i know that ice cream existed * before * refrigeration elsewhere . 
  so maybe there could have been ? 
  butt-hurt ? 
  i 'm just trying to explain to you that your explanation does n't make sense . 
  romanians have forgotten a lot of their own history . 
  we insist on it because it 's part of our history . 
  `` only dark ages '' = period of time when our country was formed - so it 's important to us . 
  [ for most of the fbe ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/territory_of_the_first_bulgarian_empire_-_9_th_century.png/640px-territory_of_the_first_bulgarian_empire_-_9_th_century.png ) , it was a majority of present day territory of romania in it . 
  i know plenty of romanians that just do n't know that from 700 - 1400 ad , bulgarians and romanians were part of one state , and following that , part of the ottoman empire together . 
  i think it 's obvious when you look at the similar culture , though , like i said in a previous post . 
  if i wanted to say ` bulgaria stronk ' i would just go around posting maps of europe from 900 ad [ like this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/europe_in_900.png/380px-europe_in_900.png ) . 
  okay - my whole year is marked . 
  next year too . 
  i do n't it 's * all * adults , it 's ages 15-24 years old . 
  keep in mind that is a pretty low number since our population pyramid is lopsided toward retirement age . 
  but i agree , there is also probably a crazy amount of under reporting going on , especially in roma communities . 
  keep in mind that sofia ! = rest of bulgaria . 
  if you go to places like vidin there is n't any employment . 
  please no tzar . 
  accident of birth is a terrible ( unfair , etc ) way to create tradition and unity in the country . 
  if we want more unity in the country , we could elect some * moral * leader to hold this post . 
  ( in my opinion , preferably not religious . ), 
  glad bulgaria is near the bottom of these charts . 
  now if we could only * fund * some science in this country ... never going to happen as long as we have a prime minister who is a combination of bob the builder and the godfather . 
  they 've been lagging behind ... 
  i keep wondering why orban bailed out individual holders of debt denominated in foreign currency . 
  that 's really been holding them back . 
  macedonia 's growth surprises me . 
  i think his name in romanian is ioannitza , maybe that 's what you 've heard ? 
  and yes , it 's complicated . 
  i think the difference is that bulgaria and turkey settled these things , and continue to settle them as they appear ( example : 1980s bulgarization of turks in bulgaria , bulgaria has apologized for this a lot of times by now . ), 
  i do n't think bulgaria was ever muslim majority , though . 
  it was very even in many places 40-60 , 50-50 , but as a whole , bulgaria was host to many bulgarians , greeks , etc which when combined were greater than the muslims ( turks , pomaks ) . 
  if you say that bulgaria was muslim majority , then bulgaria can definitely say eastern thrace was bulgarian majority . 
  true - they like to pretend that part of their history does n't exist . 
   check the bulgarian history wiki article , or look at some maps : [ 700 ad ] ( http://www.euratlas.net/history/europe/800/800.jpg ) [ 1200s ad ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/campaigns_of_ivan_assen_ii.png ) i 've always found it strange how romanian textbooks as well barely mention the bulgarian part of their history . 
  edit : i think it 's also worth mentioning that most sources also support the theory that kaloyan of bulgaria was actually vlach ( read : romanian ) . 
  true - but they have a lot of hungarian influence which is a lot more recent . 
  in any case , i would agree that it is more wallachia/dobrudja that is similar . 
  they are macedonian . 
  same way that austrians are austrian nationality and not german . 
  bulgaria and romania were part of the first and second bulgarian empires . 
  in fact the second bulgarian empire is often called the empire of vlachs and bulgars ( aka romanians and bulgarians ) . 
  so that 's 400 years for the first one , and about 200 for the second one . 
  and of course , we all lived in the same lands during the ottoman empire , it was the breakup of the empire that really forced the different ethnic groups to cluster in particular places . 
  culture is ridiculously similar - we are more similar culturally to romanians than to serbians , despite the fact that bulgarian language is closer to serbian than romanian . 
  macedonia is the obvious choice - least language difficulties . 
  romania second for historical reasons , and serbia third . 
  bulgarian seems to be lumped in with eastern slavic languages , simply because both use the cyrillic script , which makes a lot of these maps wrong for bulgaria . 
  from here : http://sofiaglobe.com/2014/03/31/road-death-rate-in-bulgaria-drops-but-remains-much-higher-than-eu-average/  bulgaria 's road death rate decreased between 2001 and 2013 but continues to be much higher than the european union average , going by figures in a european commission statement on march 31 2014 . 
   in bulgaria in 2013 , the number of fatalities per million inhabitants was 82 , while across the eu the average was 52 . 
  i would probably recommend taking buses , as the drivers know how to handle the roads and other drivers . 
  berbatov fans are . 
  he has his fair share of fans , but also a lot of people do n't like him or could n't care less about him , especially since he stopped playing for the national team . 
  just need to watch the monaco - juventus game starting in an hour .

  what is a good , independent macedonian news site ? 
  macedonian language is fine for me . 
  i suppose . 
  as things stand , there are only two regional adversaries that could potentially threaten bulgaria . 
  russian green men and isis fighters - against neither of which would nuclear weapons be used to defend bulgaria . 
  granted - i doubt either will attack bulgaria . 
  i wonder why this matter is more important to the diaspora , rather than to the armenians living next door to turkey ? 
  are they descendants of misplaced armenians ? 
  or is it something else ? 
  in any case - it would seem that it is impossible to come to an arrangement as long as terms like united armenia are being thrown around . 
  i know bulgaria and turkey , despite a lot of bad blood on both sides , managed to form a dialogue and have put a lot of past transgressions behind . 
  less safe . 
  though god ( or the queen , maybe ) only knows if they would ever be used to defend bulgaria . 
  i would n't take the ` gibb clay ' comment personally . 
  turks in / r/europe are subjected daily to ` remove kebab , ' which is just as offensive . 
  the anonymity of the internet makes simplifications like that pretty likely , as people tend to rally around simplistic ideas . 
  not really . 
  it 's all about how a country treats its minorities . 
  i would hope in the 21st century we can move past the , `` they speak a different language than me , therefore they must be a threat , '' mentality . 
  i think it can honestly be said that what is happening in ukraine today happened in the ottoman empire 150 years ago : as an excuse to wage war , russia supports separatists in a foreign country who want to be independent . 
  this results in massive strife for the local turkish population , including mass death and expulsion of newly created states in the balkans . 
  the ottomans , fearing that this would happen again , and in anatolia no less , in their brutality decided to solve this problem by killing the armenians off . 
  it 's a tragedy from both ends . 
  and the biggest tragedy is that we have n't learned anything and things like this are still happening . 
  i do n't think it was ataturk 's forces that ordered this or condoned it though , it was the pasha and the vestiges of the ottoman empire . 
  in my opinion , kemal ataturk 's turkey is n't responsible for the acts - however today 's turkey should find some way to live in peace with armenia , and vice versa of course . 
  armenians ca n't hide behind russia forever , they need to solve their problems . 
  turkish friends explain it to me like this - the forced relocation was justified because the armenians were rebelling during a time of war and putting local turkish lives at risk . 
  the subsequent horrors during the relocation were done by kurds . 
  anyway , in my mind , even a single life lost is a tragedy , and there must have been some better way to safeguard both turkish and armenian lives . 
  what happened was a tragedy , and obviously the armenians still feel wronged by this . 
  aside from recognition , have the armenians asked for/demanded any reparations ? 
  so you 're going to kick out the descendants for some perceived crime made by their grandparents ? 
  whatever happened to , thou shalt not visit the sins of the father upon the son ? 
  or common human decency , for that matter ? 
  basically , to piggy back from another trending topic on / r/europe right now , you want to kick out the russians like the turks kicked out the armenians , because they are a ` threat ' to your society . 
  is n't there a better way ? 
  or are we going to make the mistakes of history all over again ? 
  you ca n't chase the tail end of who moved where first . 
  you have to look at the existing situation . 
  forcing somebody to move out of their home is wrong . 
  imagine if this was the balkans .
