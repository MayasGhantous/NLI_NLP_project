  he cites his arguments . 
  does n't matter if it 's a blog or a newspaper article . 
  there is plenty of reason . 
  minority groups are often stereotyped as preying against society 's most vulnerable , as [ this article ] ( http://psc.dss.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_molestation.html ) states . 
   when we evaluate research on child molestation , our task is complicated by several problems . 
   one problem is that none of the studies in this area have obtained data from a probability sample , that is , a sample that can be assumed to be representative of the population of all child molesters . 
  rather , most research has been conducted only with convicted perpetrators or with pedophiles who sought professional help . 
  consequently , they may not accurately describe child molesters who have never been caught or have not sought treatment . 
  hi , the tone of the subreddit and other meta content belongs in / r/europemeta . 
  we understand that the current events of the past year have pushed people toward extreme opinions , and we are working on bettering the atmosphere of the subreddit . 
  however , please keep posts on topic . 
  no personal attacks , please . 
  so you 'd rather the eu fuck over turkey , than turkey fuck over the eu ? 
  this really is an issue that the eu and turkey need to work together on . 
  that title is so bad ... 
  i still do n't understand it after looking at the article . 
  is there a more recent source ? 
  not sure if i trust a source from 1992 with regard to homosexual pedophiles . 
  in the greek language , maybe , i do n't know . 
  in english hellenic i believe refers to someone who adopts ( or is born into ) greek culture , but is not ethnically greek . 
  for example , ptolemaic egypt was definitely hellenic , but also definitely not greek . 
  we can see this by the evidence that macedonians had their own language prior to greek becoming their language in the 4th century bc . 
  does that make serbia western bulgaria ? 
  :d there was this one facebook page , i ca n't find it right now , where some ultra serb nationalists had made a map of serbia + bulgaria , titled it ` bulgaria is serbian ! ', 
  and then proceeded to talk about how cool it would be to have a black sea coast . 
  i doubt you 'll find many historians claiming alexander was * greek * . 
  they claim he is hellenic . 
  i 'm sure he is also counting states in ee . 
  they claim things like samuil is macedonian , and plenty of other revolutionary heroes . 
  i do think samuil was technically their ancestor 's king , and the revolutionary heroes did fight for a free macedonia , even if many of them wrote that they were bulgarian and they were fighting to unify macedonia with bulgaria . 
  i do n't know , on one hand it bothers me that they butcher history and try to fit it into their own narrative , but on the other hand i know that plenty of history was made to conveniently fit into bulgarian narratives , greek narratives , american narratives , etc. 
  i mean , obviously i was speaking anecdotally , but at the same time , i 'm not going to discount that . 
  yes , many macedonians are close to serbians today . 
  whether that is the result of 80 years being part of serbia/yugoslavia , mixed macedonian-serbian marriages , or something else , it is entirely true that many macedonians today feel very close to serbians . 
  that does n't negate that many still feel close to bulgarians , or feel close to both bulgarians and serbians . 
  if they want to be their own nation , that 's fine . 
  i would n't wish bulgaria 's corrupt former apparatchik government on anyone . 
  if you look at bulgaria 's policy toward macedonia , the policy is unconditional help when truly needed , but insistence of a ` good neighbor ' agreement for support to inclusion in the eu . 
  this good neighbor agreement seeks to settle these kinds of claims by the macedonians so there is no friction going forward . 
  yeah - no argument there . 
  still , more than half of macedonians in real life that i have met say we are `` the same people . '', 
  could be they are just saying what they think i want to hear . 
  are there any statistics on how many have bulgarian citizenship ? 
  no personal attacks , please . 
  i doubt even those 49.5 % of turks wanted their country to be attacked non-stop . 
  and - the elections were heavily manipulated to make ordinary turks vote for akp . 
  honestly , if this guy thinks attaka is becoming larger in bulgaria , he is n't paying attention at all to bulgarian politics . 
  for which he can obviously be pardoned , but attaka is led by a crazy guy who gets russian funding , and is nothing about what he mentions in the rest of the article . 
  definitely interesting to me !, 
  the balkars are one of the many groups who could be descended from the bulgars . 
  sad to see another group of people who still have n't recovered from a historical tragedy of relocation . 
  would n't be the first !, 
  although the eu is supposed to align all european countries together . 
  still , would trust kovesi to clean up bulgaria more than any other figure right now . 
  from wiki :  in august 1943 , after a visit to germany , bulgarian tsar boris iii died suddenly , believed to have been poisoned . 
  basically , public opinion was decidedly against the deportation of jews . 
  in june 1943 , king boris ordered all sofia jews to be taken to the countryside , some speculate so that he could say to hitler - look , we need these guys to farm our lands , build our roads , etc. 
  the very next time he went to germany , he was poisoned , as witnessed by two german physicians attending him . 
  it 's a day to be celebrated for bulgarians . 
  an example of the bulgarian people coming together to do the right thing . 
  the king should have done more , but it does n't take away from the public defense of what had become the scapegoat minority in europe . 
  edit : who downvotes the saving of jews in bulgaria ? 
  the monarchy and the army caved to hitler 's demands , as far as i remember . 
  it was the church and civil society that forced a reversal of the deportation of the jews . 
  the new territories were obviously separated from the core of the bulgarian church and civil society . 
  romania , i love you guys . 
  please start demanding the arrest of bulgarian mafia soon . 
  you did n't kick out so much as assimilated . 
  and that 's in the past , these people consider themselves greek now , and it does n't really matter . 
  it does n't change the fact that the people themselves have n't really changed . 
  i could be wrong - was there a large resettlement of greeks from elsewhere to the north of greece ? 
  you can assimilate the people , they can speak greek , does that change their ethnicity ? 
  and besides , are n't there many slavic speakers in northern greece outside of thessaloniki ? 
  it 's more than the headline or the article implies . 
  the albanians installed a double eagle , which i believe was taken down , in their neighborhood . 
  then , the macedonians started installing this cross , in the albanian neighborhood after the double eagle was taken down . 
  not to mention the building of churches in the albanian neighborhood as well . 
  \u0420\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0438 is either the name for the russian language , or the adjective russian ( plural ) . 
  russia is simply \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u044f, 
  very touching . 
  do poles understand any of it without a translation ? 
  okay , buddy , here you go . 
  * [ bulgarians are descendants of thracians ] ( https://www.quora.com/are-bulgarians-ethnic-slavs-or-thracians ) , [ with some ethnic slav mixture , and a very tiny bit of turkic contribution through the bulgars ] ( http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/bulgarians.html ) . 
  * [ there are still thracian holidays ] ( http://www.visitbulgaria.net/en/articles/saint_trifon_zarezan.html ) / [ rituals ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nestinarstvo ) [ celebrated in bulgaria to this day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kukeri ) . 
  dare i say it ? 
  martenitsa 's are an excellent indication of this as well . 
  * [ evidence that the martenitsa ritual could be thracian . 
  ] ( http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.thracians.net%2findex.php%3foption%3dcom_content%26task%3dview%26id%3d411%26itemid%3d106 ) it explicitly states that the eleusinian explanation was introduced through a literary way to explain the fertility rite which was already present on the balkan peninsula . 
  * the new year 's tradition [ survakane ] ( http://www.hala.bg/images_news/no_res1356785091%d1%81%d1%83%d1%80%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8.jpg ) which also comes from the same tradition . 
  you should realize that there are many versions of bulgarian history , many on the web , many written on books . 
  you have to take them with a grain of salt . 
  the russians pushed that we are eternal slav brothers , the turks pushed that we are self-forgotten turks . 
  the greeks have tried to hellenize us many times over , both through religion and forced hellenization such as burning bulgarian books . 
  you have to really use occam 's razor to cut deep through the millenia of propagandizing around bulgarian origins . 
  it 's a tradition practiced in bulgaria -  bulgarian tradition . 
  i 'm not saying , nor have i ever said , that it is exclusively bulgarian . 
  read my posts . 
  my beef with you is that you made it of greek origin . 
   `` actually this tradition originated in greece . 
  it was an ancient custom that was passed to byzantium times and from there to many of the region peoples . '',
