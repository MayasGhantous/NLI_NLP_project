  most ~ ~ turks ~ ~ people i 've met do n't know that stanbul was actually the colloquial greek name for the city . 
  it 's a hard point to get across , because for most people , erdogan is turkey . 
  turkish society is holding on , especially in places like izmir . 
  in the end , turkey is our ally , and i understand turkish frustration with its supposed allies turning a blind eye to a hostile force on its border looking to supply and fuel a separatist insurgency inside the country . 
  they were n't ` bulgarian ' claims . 
  serbians and turk sources also point to the fact that it was bulgarians living in today 's macedonia . 
  serbs only changed their tune when they decided to limit bulgarian growth in the balkans . 
  in fact , the only macedonians who do n't express to me that macedonians are bulgarians are the ones descended from serb/macedonian mixed marriages . 
  in fact , it was n't even the whole ottoman empire at that point . 
  the empire passed laws and reforms granting equal status to people of all religions . 
  it was the provincial governors that used irregular troops , which committed atrocities . 
  and just like today with the kurds , it 's not like bulgarians and other christians were really blameless either . 
  we did plenty of horrible things to the turks of the time period as well . 
  are we really not going to protect a nato ally with an insurgency supported by the russians ? 
  imagine if this was france , not turkey . 
  the only non-mountainous route through bulgaria romania would be along the danube . 
  otherwise we have a hell of a lot more mountains than montenegro or albania . 
  this map is a little useless without knowing what the starting unemployment rate is . 
  this year it was actually pretty heavy for a couple of weeks . 
  however , i do n't even think one meter of snow would deter these refugees . 
  sorry , but it does snow in western thrace , just as it snows in thessalonica , and just as it snows in istanbul . 
  it 's rare , but this winter , it did snow there . 
  * thousands of meters high . 
  that vidin area . 
  it 's like hope died there . 
   the october revolution in russia changed the game anew . 
  suddenly , the right-wing parties in finland started to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of highest executive power from the russian government to finland , as radical communists took power in russia . 
  rather than acknowledge the authority of the power law of a few months earlier , the right-wing government declared independence on 6 december 1917 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/finland#civil_war_and_early_independence, 
  you 're not ` allowed ' to revise history and make things up . 
  finland was never part of the soviet sphere . 
  in fact , it was precisely because of the communist revolution that finland was able to declare and achieve independence from the russian empire . 
  i think these figures will all be revised as more detailed data comes in . 
  for bulgaria , last spring , the estimate was that the economy would grow at 0.8 % for the year , then it got revised up to 1.7 % in the autumn , and 3 days ago , was revised up to 2.2 % . 
  so , the final figures may well surprise for a lot of ee countries , considering the low oil prices have been a terrific boon for the region . 
  also surprised that bulgaria is so low , considering bulgaria saved all of the jews on its soil despite being allied with the nazis . 
  * yes , i know that jews in lands occupied bulgaria did n't share that fate , which is terrible . 
  but the reason the jews in bulgaria proper were saved was because of civil society , not the good will of the bulgarian army . 
  bulgaria too . 
  posting this here just for the ridiculousness of it . 
  i 'm more surprised bulgaria is beating the eu average . 
  our national consciousness arises from the freedom fight against the ottoman empire . 
  and our 19th century fore-fathers tied that fight to the existence of the bulgarian ethnos and medieval state . 
  austria-hungary really fucked bulgaria over . 
  not surprising , really , they wanted to expand their influence/power southeast , and they could n't do that with a strong bulgaria . 
  first they goad serbia into attacking bulgaria during the bulgarian unification . 
  the serbian king * told his soldiers they would be fighting the turks . 
  * when they found out they were fighting the bulgarians they got pretty demoralized that they would be fighting their fellow christians who had helped them get independence . 
  second , austria-hungary refused serbia to keep northern albania , which led to serbia keeping vardar macedonia as compensation . 
  not to mention their meddling in serbian politics led to wwi . 
  greece did n't have this with bulgaria , but serbia and bulgaria had a treaty that vardar macedonia would go to bulgaria . 
  however , serbia could not claim northern albania as they wanted , so they decided to keep vardar macedonia instead . 
  at that point , serbia was illegally keeping troops on bulgarian soil ... and then the 2nd balkan war happened .

  is anybody else really confused by the other comment in this thread ? 
  yes , croatia remained a part of yugoslavia , not a sovereign nation . 
  mountain in bulgarian is also planina ( \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) . 
  \u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f is sunday in bulgarian . 
  you clearly do n't know about bulgarian history during the war . 
  not only was bulgarian society anti-war , the populace actively hindered deportations of jews . 
  not only that , but there was active mutiny in the army against the nazis . 
  again , croatians were much more belligerent than bulgarians during the war . 
  you do realize that croatia was much more belligerent than bulgaria ? 
  and this whole `` yugoslav '' territory crap . 
  do n't get me started about macedonia and the other crap that serbs pulled on bulgarians . 
  croatians should know really well what serbians are capable of .
