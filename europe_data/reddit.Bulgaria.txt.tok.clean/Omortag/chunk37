  got it . 
  well , in that case i hope they vote for one of the other parties !, 
  i wish more people focused on parties like rb and yes , bulgaria , where the main issue is reform , and not parties where the main reason to vote for them is out of loyalty . 
  no worries - honestly , i do n't see erodgan having as much success here as he has had with the newer diaspora . 
  these days there 's a lot more bridge building going on . 
  was recently watching some news about bulgarian turks helping their neighbors build a church , and earlier this year i remember watching the news about christians and muslims celebrating ramazan together . 
  to be honest , i have n't heard of them , and they are n't included in the recent polls that i see . 
  why do you say that ? 
  i mean , ideally i 'd like a party without erdogan 's support , but then dps is n't exactly a shining beacon either . 
  sorry - i forgot that basically the president gave them a mandate . 
  let me fix that . 
  probably true - the interview i read recently said exactly that . 
  i mean , the government has basically forgotten everything outside of sofia . 
  also dps has been in power much more recently . 
  the whole point of that party is supposedly to give a voice to minorities . 
  hey , they said it , not me . 
  as long as we 're participating in this fantasy , we 'd have to note that the terrain in southern bulgaria is not conducive for turkish advance at all , through the balkan mountains . 
  true , but now that turkey is favoring dost , it will be interesting to see how much of the vote from turkey will be for dps . 
  in bulgaria it 's a bit different , as these turks have been our neighbors for a long time , and have lived here since ottoman times . 
  in fact , the reason why so many bulgarian turks moved to turkey was because of the assimilation campaign by the communist government in the 80 's . 
  the turks were forced to take bulgarian names , and many ended up leaving the country . 
  however , they kept their citizenship , and now turkey is using this to support its preferred party in the elections . 
  turkey 's pressure on bulgaria continues ...  turkey 's government has issued an order stating people with dual citizenship may use 11 days of administrative leave in order to take part in the campaign for the parliamentary vote in bulgaria and vote at their birthplaces . 
   the order is secret and has been circulated to all state institutions . 
  the length of leave is from march 20 to march 31 .

  turbofolk is usually what we call the ` pop folk ' music of serbia . 
  in bulgaria we just call it ` folk ' or ` chalga . ', 
  interesting that you guys call it turbofolk !, 
  sorry you have to deal with people spreading stuff like this . 
  what would be the correct form ? 
  please take sofia as well . 
  that way you can have boyko , radev , and all the other clowns as well . 
  i know you 're joking , but the avar khaganate was gone by that point of time , makes me question the whole map . 
  my only point was against him calling it irreconcilable differences . 
  yes , i agree with your statement . 
  but to say that the uk has irreconcilable differences with the eu is too strong . 
  it depends where , right ? 
  if you 're talking northern greece , that has historically been bulgarian a lot more often . 
  if we 're talking larissa , then yes , 25 years is about right . 
  and if we 're talking athens - never . 
  well , not sure the source on the original map , but romania was part of the first bulgarian empire for hundreds of years . 
  wallachia and transylvania were also part of the 2nd bulgarian empire . 
  i agree - they had no problem leaving the eu , or staying in the eu . 
  if they had felt strongly one way or another , they would have voted . 
  my only point was against him calling it irreconcilable differences . 
  more than 2/3rds of the population either wanted to stay , or had no problem staying . 
  all countries have gone through bad rule that put people down and stunted development . 
  some are still there . 
  the thing we do wrong is to take it personally and use it as an excuse . 
  there 's no excuse anymore . 
  in bulgaria people hate the ottoman empire , followed by a strong distrust of the turkish state . 
  there 's generally little to none animosity toward turkish people , aside from internet warriors and 14 year old 's who just had a class about devshirme . 
  bulgaria under the ottomans in the 18th century had some of the first factories on the balkans . 
  the sultan decreed that all peoples and religions were equal - it was the mid-level governors that still despised the non-turkish populations , and then , not even all of them . 
  it 's really nationalism plus a feeling that the ottomans treated us as dirt for 5 centuries that causes the reactions like on this thread . 
  most bulgarians do n't have issues with turkish people . 
  let 's stop blaming the ottomans for everything . 
  look at the difference between sk and nk , and then tell me what we 've done with over 100 years of independence . 
  and do n't blame the russians either - because we 're the ones that fucked up the transition the most out of all of eastern europe , aside from war-torn yugoslavia . 
  irreconcilable differences is really too strong . 
  the stay voters + the non-voters obviously had no issue with staying in the eu , and combined they are an overwhelming majority . 
  if the issues truly were irreconcilable , then the uk would be on the verge of civil war .

  welcome to bulgarian politics for the last 20 years . 
  turkish party - vote for us because we 're the only ones who will save you from the far right !, 
  far right - vote for us because we 're the only ones who will save you from the turks !, 
  ( of course it later turned out that both the turkish party and the far right parties were controlled by russia . ), 
  that 's my point , russia has historically been a balance to continental imperialism , starting with napoleon . 
  not that their form of imperialism was any better , but it 's better to have a geopolitical balance than to have everyone under 1 boot . 
  so it is possible for russia to be weak , and russia being weak is not necessarily a good thing historically . 
  however , i agree that in today 's world , russia being weak is a good thing . 
  this photo is inspiring . 
  all the strength to the turkish people for a bright future .
