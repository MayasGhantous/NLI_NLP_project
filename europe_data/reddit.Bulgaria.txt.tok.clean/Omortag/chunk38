  they succeeded in ww1 - so it is possible . 
  a strong russia/su was the reason all of europe did n't fall to fascism , which was a positive result , at least for the western half of the continent that escaped authoritarianism . 
  the eastern half fell into an authoritarianism that sought to control how people think , and , outside of the su , did not commit large parts of their population to being removed or being 2nd class citizens . 
  not condoning communist authoritarianism in europe by any means , but i think it was certainly better than having all slavs , and others , wiped out for lebensraum . 
  no personal attacks , please . 
  that 's a bit of a one-sided view . 
  what if hitler had overrun the soviet union ? 
  could you both try to be a little more civil ? 
  both arguments have merit given the division in the uk , but this does n't have to get personal .

  i 've had 2 turkish people off reddit wish me a happy holiday , so i think you 're off the mark with this one .

  and yet without the soviets pushing for it , the space race would n't have happened , and we would be far from where we are now . 
  ukraine was a part of that , and both russians and ukrainians should be very proud of it . 
  i think they are about 10-15 km . 
  it is vitosha mountain , with a peak ( not on the photo ) of 2290 meters . 
  the wikipedia page about the vitosha boulevard has a few more photos with the mountain in the background : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vitosha_boulevard, 
  the other guy he was replying to was saying something along the lines of : `` allah does n't like those who say no , '' or something like allah does bad things to people who say no . 
  ( 2nd hand information ) so , i 'm pretty sure any sane turkish person who is not for erdogan would have gotten pretty riled up at that . 
  title is editorialized , and nowhere in the article does it say that . 
  we knew this back on july 16th : http://www.novinite.com/articles/175521/turkey's+envoy+to+bulgaria%3a+arrests+of+judges+'planned'+before+coup part of the reason the coup was ` moved up ' was because the coup plotters learned that they were about to lose their positions . 
  no personal attacks/insults please . 
  there was a reason the ottomans were able to expand as far as they did in the 1300s-1600s . 
  at that point , they were far from weak . 
  they were disciplined , well-led , and even their foot soldiers were healthier . 
  for example , drinking of alcohol was much less prevalent in their ranks , and care for their horses was much higher . 
  of course they were also cunning , treacherous , disregarded agreements , and so forth . 
  but that also helped them expand . 
  edit : of course 2 other major issues . 
  the black death affected the balkans a lot more than it did the turks , and also the hungarians were also trying to expand south toward vidin . 
  whereas the bulgarians were able to repulse the hungarians , it left them much too weak to respond to the ottoman conquests as well . 
  the duck protests , alluding to a certain body part . 
  thanks for the long reply !, 
  the reason i ask is that in bulgaria , pomaks are simply seen as bulgarian muslims . 
  so even pomaks in greece , macedonia , etc , are said to be bulgarian . 
  so i was wondering whether in turkey pomaks are seen as bulgarian , or as separate . 
  i find turkish national consciousness fascinating - clearly , it 's a whole lot of different people that have come together to make one nation . 
  the idea behind it used to be religion , now it 's nationalism . 
  aha - got it . 
  that 's super interesting . 
  are you trying to say that the official language of lithuania was old ruthenian ? 
  or that old church slavonic was old ruthenian ? 
  wait what ? 
  so you guys basically had old bulgarian as your official language ? 
  from when to when ? 
  to me it 's interesting that you mentioned pomaks . 
  are they viewed differently than bulgarian turks ? 
  pretty sure people were poorer during communism and still had more children . 
  my dad 's family lived in a 1 bedroom apartment the five of them . 
  families can certainly afford that today , but they do n't want to do that . 
  bulgaria has less than a fifth of poland 's population . 
  pretty sure we would top the per capita charts no problem . 
  i do n't think the serbian influence comes as any surprise given that macedonia was part of yugoslavia for so long , i 'd bet that the serbian intelligence agencies hold many trump cards . 
  serbia has a vested interest in keeping macedonia isolated - one of its biggest fears is a macedonia working with bulgaria . 
  not because bulgaria is going to attack serbia , but rather because of 20th century political momentum . 
  how many wars have bulgaria and serbia fought over macedonia ?
