  greece damaged itself . 
  in fact , greek 's are some of the most patriotic people in europe - do you really think that greek businesses would be moving to bulgaria if it was n't for the ridiculous failings of the greek government ? 
  or , the greek government is fucking over businesses with a 50 % ( or higher ! ), 
  tax rate . 
  small business owners and their employers in greece were n't the ones who got greece into the massive debt , and yet it seems like the answer is always - tax the businesses more . 
  bulgaria 's tax law has nothing to do with greece . 
  it was implemented a long time ago in order to cut down the size of the non-reported grey economy . 
  by virtue of being in the single market , greeks can now operate from bulgaria . 
  not some nefarious plot by bulgaria . 
  something i read once upon a time said their mother was slavic bulgarian , while their father was greek . 
  any backing to this ?

  interesting !, 
  it means cherished or highly valued . 
  so not quite expensive , but almost there . 
  and throwing out the bulgarian \u0441\u043a\u044a\u043f also has the same double meaning . 
  slavic countries really put a huge emphasis on health , so i do n't think this is threatening at all . 
  in slavic languages , we literally command each other to be healthy when saying hello . 
  hey - you already took our access to the aegean , now you want more of our black sea coast ?

  that 's true . 
  though bulgarian has a huge percentage of turkic words , but that might be more easily explainable by being in the ottoman empire for 500 years + proximity to istanbul . 
  and there are also a few major grammatical differences between bulgarian and other slavic languages . 
  hungary definitely wins for retaining the language though !, 
  cyrillic alphabet can be adapted to suit turkic languages just as well as the latin one can . 
  it 's a bunch of squiggly lines that people then attach sounds to . 
  for example , the same letters in english and german can have very different sounds . 
  even in english , for example , the letter u can have different sounds : - turn - music - june - pull would you ever argue that the latin alphabet is not suited to the english language ? 
  bulgarians have you beat by 300-400 years . 
  i stumbled across this while reading about the [ warsaw pact ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warsaw_pact#beginnings ) on wikipedia . 
  apparently , the soviet union offered to have germany reunified as well in this 1954 proposal . 
  here is the full length of the [ soviet union 's application ] ( http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/molotovs-proposal-the-ussr-join-nato-march-1954 ) . 
  apparently , in 1991 , it was also a [ long term goal of president yeltsin 's for russia to join nato ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/21/world/soviet-disarray-yeltsin-says-russia-seeks-to-join-nato.html ) . 
  here is a 2001 [ guardian interview ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/17/russia.iantraynor ) with president putin which says that he privately suggested that russia join nato to the usa , but was rebuffed by madeleine albright . 
  my question is this : why was it so unthinkable that the soviet union and the united states be in a common security treaty following their alliance less than a decade earlier to bring down the nazis ? 
  could the west have integrated russia/the soviet union more , and through this process , encouraged them to liberalize more ? 
  have we all forgotten former us treasure secretary [ timothy geithner 's recollection of a g7 finance minister 's meeting ] ( http://blogs.ft.com/brusselsblog/2014/11/11/draghis-ecb-management-the-leaked-geithner-files/ ) ? 
   the europeans came into that meeting basically saying : `` we 're going to teach the greeks a lesson . 
  they are really terrible . 
  they lied to us . 
  they suck and they were profligate and took advantage of the whole basic thing and we 're going to crush them , '' was their basic attitude , all of them ... . 
  to me , there 's no question that the greek governments prior to the crash mismanaged the state 's finances . 
  there 's no question that the banks which lent money to the greeks also should shoulder the blame , and instead just got bailed out , and the loans were transferred to the greek people in general . 
  so yes , the greeks do have themselves to blame for a lot . 
  but after the failed policies of the troika , after the unimaginable suffering in greece , juncker 's flip flopping , can the greeks even trust the words coming out of the troika 's mouth ? 
  what 's more important to the troika ? 
  fixing the economic mess , or making an example of the greeks ? 
  #scroll down for updates !, 
  the voting activity information can be found [ here ] ( https://results.cik.bg/pi2017/aktivnost/index.html ) . 
  later , the results will start being published on that same website under the ' \u0420\u0415\u0417\u0423\u041b\u0422\u0410\u0422\u0418 ' section . 
  -- the upcoming bulgarian parliamentary elections are this sunday , march 26th . 
  i wanted to make a thread about them since bulgaria right now seems to be in a somewhat delicate situation . 
  we 've had pressure from our neighbors , turkey , financial and media influence from russia across the black sea and our own trump-like candidate . 
  all parties except the united patriots are pro-eu membership , although to varying degrees . 
  # election system ** cycle : ** every 4 years , unless cabinet `` collapses '' before ** voting system : ** party-list proportional representation ** total number of seats : ** 240 ** electoral threshold : ** 4 % ** why now ? 
  ** the previous administration , led by the gerb ( citizens for the european development of bulgaria ) party , resigned after it lost the [ 2016 presidential elections ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_presidential_election,_2016 ) to rumen radev . 
  radev was a supposedly independent candidate who nevertheless received backing from the bsp ( bulgarian socialist party ) who is a former air force general and backs warmer ties with russia . 
  currently , the country has been led by an interim government . 
  an important note , gerb 's prime minister , boyko borissov , has already used resignation successfully as a way to keep his party out of the spotlight during a run-up to elections after resigning during massive protests against high electricity prices in 2013 . 
  ** how it works ** the 240 seats in the parliament are filled through an open list proportional system . 
  there are 31 districts with between 4 and 16 mps coming from each district . 
  voters can choose candidates preferentially , however , they can not switch out the leader of the party . 
  voting in bulgaria is now mandatory , however there is no penalty for not voting . 
  there are 21 parties and coalitions registered for these elections . 
  ** the context ** bulgaria is a member of the european union and of nato . 
  bulgaria today has finally started seeing some economic growth of a few years after the crises of the last 10 years .
