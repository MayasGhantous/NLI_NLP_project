  night temperature in september gradually falls , reaching no more than 10 -- 12 \u00b0 c at the end of the month . 
  overall , september is considered to be the driest month of the year . 
  one to cover each major scandal that he has swept under the rug . . 
  not an expert on this , but just googled and saw that there are indeed [ organized trips ] ( http://bulguides.com/hiking/what/biking/ ) for these sorts of things . 
  indeed , there is a small city of [ gabrovo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gabrovo ) . 
  the reputation that gabrovo has in bulgaria is two-fold . 
  first , they are known for their dry humor . 
  second , they are known for their thriftiness . 
  it was the people of gabrovo that donated enough money to start the first bulgarian university following the liberation from the ottoman empire . 
  so they spent that saved money well . 
  but yes , they get made fun of a lot , and they make fun of themselves a lot too . 
  from the [ numbeo cost of living online calculator ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dbuworp.png ) i compared london and sofia , but on the black sea coast , prices can be higher if there are a lot of foreign tourists . 
  / u/gsefcgs covered the main points , but i have found when talking to people from varna and plovdiv are particularly proud of their respective city , so there is a bit of a rivalry as to which city is bulgaria 's ' 2nd ' city . 
  to each his own ... 
  i think if you want to visit beautiful large cities , perhaps you should go to vienna , italy , or other parts of western europe . 
  sofia has a very nice european city center , but the legacy of communism remains with the residential districts . 
  but do n't get me wrong , the communists did some things right , such as having many large green parks throughout sofia . 
  french is really popular is a language studied in school . 
  many study both english and french . 
  unfortunately , i do n't think you 'll be that well off . 
  i think a eurobarometer study said that 9 % of respondents responded they could speak french . 
  thanks for mentioning this !, 
  i only had so much time and energy to put the ones above together . 
   perhaps a part 2 sometime in the future , full of skiing , shopska salad , and other must do activities ? 
  this is actually super entertaining . 
  i never heard it referred to that way . 
  but , i added the information that it can be referred to as a peninsula since the bridge connecting it is a land bridge . 
  thanks for pointing that out . 
  fixed it . 
  fixed . 
  thank you !, 
  that 's pretty much the exact analogy my father made when he first saw the two towers 10 years ago . 
  yeah - weather would be a good addition . 
  my favorite russian contribution is by far the advances in space exploration . 
  so i 'd have to say that [ sergei korolev ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/skorolow.jpg/800px-skorolow.jpg ) is the russian that i appreciate the most . 
  without his genius , russia would never have achieved as much as it did in this field . 
  if he had n't died , i have no doubt that the russians would have reached the moon first . 
  inspired by / u/ekvinoksij and this post : [ so you want to visit slovenia ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2ralu3/so_you_want_to_visit_slovenia/ ), 
  difference of opinion does not warrant name calling and insults . 
  no , what you just described is communism . 
  socialism is a stepping stone to communism , where instead of the workers owning everything , the state owns everything . 
  that turned out * great * . 
  reminds me of how the ussr promised macedonia , belomorska trakiya , and even part of turkish thrace to bulgaria if it fought the nazis in wwii , but the government considered soviet victory so far fetched that it dismissed the offer . 
  bulgarians are richer than before , but much more unhappy . 
  it depends on what you value most : - wealth per capita ? 
  - happiness per capita ? 
  - territorial size of country ? 
  - importance/influence of country on european/global scale ? 
  - number of citizens , low or high ? 
  saw this on facebook . 
  the communist and socialist ones are switched . 
  in real communism , there is no state . 
  i read somewhere that germany bribed tzar ferdinand with 20 million d-marks to join germany in ww1 ? 
  obviously the macedonia issue is why most of the populace went along with it , though . 
  bulgaria 's understanding of russia is a bit more nuanced than the view of most european countries toward russia . 
  bulgarians recognize the many achievements russia , including helping to liberate the country from the ottoman empire . 
  we have a statue of a russian tzar outside of our parliament , a monument to russia elsewhere in the capital , our main cathedral is named after a russian saint , and is near a russian church , and on and on . 
  we recognize their technical achievements , such as going to space and their contributions to world knowledge . 
  not to mention the literary and cultural ties between the two countries . 
  this leads to bulgarians even admiring russians to an extend . 
  however , this is fast changing . 
  young bulgarians now realize that russia 's help in freeing bulgaria from the ottoman empire was merely a play to extend their power into the balkans . 
  also , it is now recognized that russia actively prevented bulgaria from uniting with macedonia . 
  combine this with resent and anger over imposing communism and their current politics , and views toward russia are at an all time low currently . 
  a huge of the amount of the gypsies left to western europe already . 
  statistics also show they are having less than 3 children now as well . 
  they 're not immune from this demographic drop either . 
  i 'll have 5 children if you will . 
  why would jaguar care ? 
  are n't they a british company that will have to do currency exchanges regardless of whether they are euros or another currency ? 
  and how much does bulgaria love russia ? 
  that 's not the case for bulgaria . 
  just invest in northern bulgaria - poorest region in the eu . 
  yes - russia and turkey are in the eu . 
  however , even your example \u0441\u044a\u0436\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0447\u0443\u044f shows what i 'm saying . 
  because you heard it . 
  adding a reason that you 're feeling the sorrow does n't change the fact that you had nothing to do with it . 
  \u0418\u0437\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c \u0441\u0435 implies that you are guilty . 
  \u0421\u044a\u0436\u0430\u043b\u044f\u0432\u0430\u043c only says that you are feeling sorrow . 
  black sea !, 
  this is an erdogan staying in power thing and you 're falling for it . 
  we just laugh and ignore those maps , as they include some part of bulgaria too . 
  actually , today ( another ) one of their ministers announced he is getting bulgarian citizenship and moving to sofia . 
  i suppose - though we have to remember that russia is quite big , and includes regions like chechnya , where there were 2 wars in the past 20 years . 
  there are a lot of tensions in the caucasus in general . 
  anyway - i definitely think there is a difference between eastern european ( read - post communist ) and western european mentality , which does fuel instability . 
  part of it is searching for an identity after having our ideological identity ripped out from under you . 
  edit : we can see that in the split of czechoslovakia as well , but not in the countries that were relatively homogeneous , like poland or hungary . 
  even in bulgaria we saw ethnic tension with the bulgarization campaign against the turks as part of stoking nationalist sentiments to fill the gap left by the waning communist ideology as a sense of identity . 
  ( personally , i think that campaign was terrible , and further isolated bulgarian turks from bulgarian bulgarians ) . 
  but that was saying the balkans as a whole are a clusterfuck . 
  i would n't say we 're that bad . 
  corrupt , sure , but not a clusterfuck . 
  well , croatia is also an eu member ... 
  why are you saying bulgaria is a clusterfuck ? 
  yes - and that is due to ` great power ' meddling in the region following the break up of the ottoman empire . 
  for example - the serbs and bulgarians liked each other and even helped each other gain independence from the ottomans . 
  then , austria-hungary decided that bulgaria was too strong , and [ egged on serbia to attack bulgaria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbo-bulgarian_war ) to prevent two bulgarian states from uniting . 
  lo and behold !,
