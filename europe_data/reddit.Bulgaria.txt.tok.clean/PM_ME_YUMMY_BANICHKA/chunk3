  remind the government its actions are being seen and met with disapproval . 
  plus , over here even those statements were met with serious butthurt and reminders of how sovereign and stronk we are , so they must be doing something right . 
  and this is exactly why people should not be okay with `` eeeeh , i 'll use a vpn if my country bans [ torrent site ] '' , `` oh look , they took [ torrent site ] down , whatever , it has a mirror , cut off one head , bla bla bla '' bittorrent equals piracy for most people . 
  and piracy equals crime . 
  copyright laws need to be reformed . 
  the cat-and-mouse game between torrent sites and anti-piracy groups only leads to them tightening the regulations little by little . 
  they have the lawyers , the capital and the financial incentive to keep the pressure on forever . 
  we do n't . 
  go go iceland , you 're our only hope . 
   lastly , lets say a group of people tryes to rob you during the night on some german gas station ( just an example ) and your forced to shot one of the attackers in the leg to stop them . 
  would that be justified or would it be considered a crime ? 
  but why stop there ? 
  let 's say the german gas station is robbed by people armed with gatling guns and flamethrowers . 
  actually , the robbers are ramsay bolton 's 20 good men . 
  and they 're being led by urdnot wrex himself . 
  so , given the circumstances ... can germany start producing nuclear weapons of its own ? 
  i think this situation i made up in my head just now totally justifies it . 
  dear refugees , a reminder that bulgaria has an [ 90 + % ] ( https://plot.ly/~joedyke/95/asylum-approval-rates-across-the-eu-2014.png ) asylum approval rate , so if you 're afraid of being deported ... ... hey , wait , where are you going ? 
  guys ? 
  guys ? 
   we need sanctions against individual government figures and their supporters semi-related : how are the foreign ambassadors reacting to the whole thing ? 
  we were lucky to have the french , german , dutch etc. 
  criticize the government and express solidarity with the protesters . 
  this was amazing , thank you !, 
  turns out i did n't know how much i wanted woodwinds in this theme until i heard this version . 
  now i miss them in the original . 
  well color me surprised , every person who 's against the current government is paid by soros to destabilize the country . 
  almost word for word what we were hearing 3 years ago . 
  i wish you all the best , guys . 
  i hope you 'll be able to draw enough international attention despite not being in the eu . 
  stay safe . 
  oh do i !, 
  [ here 's a banichka , all nice and presentable .

  ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wedanhfboxc/tvmjx5db4ni/aaaaaaaac34/ffpslvqiq1q/s640/photo-203.jpg ), 
  it 's food . 
  you can safely replace it with `` pizza '' for all intents and purposes . 
  well , there 's a bulgarian saying relevant to my username * and * the situation , so : * he who eats two banichki is n't crazy , crazy is he who gives them to him . 
  * homophobia should obviously be curbed , but any country is free to push whatever agenda it wants . 
  i find the fact that the un is willing to whore itself out so easily much more troubling ( though unsurprising ) than the agenda of said countries . 
  *** right , so you 're not getting it . 
  either the saying does n't translate well , or i have n't translated it properly . 
  or you people are too happy buying other people 's hearty lunches . 
  one more try : * he who takes the whole arm when given a finger is n't mad , mad is the one the arm belongs to . 
  * eeeeeh , i 'll get it on the 3765873th try . 
  ahahahahha , did you think you could hide your atrocities from the world , germans ? 
  not on erdogan 's watch you wo n't !, 
  he will build a reminder of all the wrong things you 've done and hidden so well from the rest of us !, 
  in gezi park , the place symbolic of the protests during which his regime was violently subduing protesters !, 
  how do you like him now , domuz-itler ? 
  devsirme ... so ... triggered ... right ... now ... 
  this would make it a civil liberty , not a right . 
  governments should n't sanction it , that much we agree on . 
  when it becomes a civil right , though , it means the government not only allows it , but guarantees it . 
  which is to say , it punishes other people when they interfere with it . 
  for example , me being free to eat a banichka is a civil liberty . 
  if the government decides that i have the right to banichki , though , i would be able to sue people for not giving/selling me any . 
  so , no , i stand by what i said : fuck the right to religious expression . 
  the moment your beliefs start affecting other people 's lives , the government should give you the finger . 
  well , bulgaria is absent even from the eastern european version . 
  a shame , would have been nice to show [ ridiculous ] ( http://m4.netinfo.bg/media/images/7513/7513346/r-1024-768-syvetskata-armiia-pametnik.jpg ) soviet [ steel-and-concrete ] ( http://socbg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/58351_425718474159318_1212255444_n.jpg ) monuments [ popping ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/buzludzha-02.jpg ) up all over the place . 
  house bulgaria : `` bent , bowed , broken . 
  pls no more . '', 
   when are non religious people getting their free out of jail card to having exemptions on the law ? 
  better yet , why do only * some * religions get away with such behavior ? 
  i can use christianity as an excuse to be homophobic , islam and judaism to circumcise babies , but when i boil my enemies alive to show them the way of his flying noodliness , suddnely i 'm a `` criminal '' and a `` disgusting human being '' . 
  ah , yes , the inalienable human right to alter the body of an infant without it being a medical necessity . 
  obviously only if the infant is male , duh , what are we , some ass-backwards african tribe ? 
  while we 're on the topic of what 's a human right and what 's not , can we please , * please * agree that the right to religious expression is bullshit and has no place in any society pretending to be secular and/or semi-civilized ? 
  a belief system that comes with the ingrained conviction of being the only correct one and superior to every other one should not be a right , i.e. , something other people grant you . 
  i should have been more careful what i wished for . 
  thanks , this is the eli5 i wanted . 
   too bad your joke is 20 years old . 
  that 's , uuuuh , not something you should be eager to mention as a russian . 
  congrats on fixing the economy , i guess ? 
  time for my favorite russian economy joke , then : `` hey , daddy , can i borrow 300 rubles ? '', 
  `` 400 rubles ? 
  what do you need 500 rubles for ? '', 
  edit : first time i get reddit gold . 
  thank you , kind anonymous stranger !, 
  i 'm just going to go ahead and admit i do n't feel i 'm competent enough to have an opinion about belene . 
  i 've read many speculations about how it 's the best/worst thing to possibly happen to our economy and stopping/restarting the project is the best/worst thing to do . 
  i do n't know what to believe so i just observe without the luxury of having anything to say about it . 
   under western pressure , bulgaria [ ... ] gave up the south stream gas pipeline project yeah , no . 
  this makes it sound so sinister . 
  ss was not compliant with preexisting eu-regulations . 
  western pressure = pressure to obey the law . 
  it was n't like the project was certain or going smoothly . 
  russia stopped it abruptly , did n't have the courtesy to inform us in a timely manner , threatened a partnership with turkey , reminded us of how much we 've lost economically and then blamed us for being a faux-orthodox , quasi-slavic western puppet . 
  but yeah , bulgaria    failing russian economy and cheap fossil fuel prices . 
  we stronk !, 
  i really need someone to eli5 why everyone is so outraged by this . 
  fellow bulgarians , please do n't give me the `` our pm is a spineless pro-russian fearmonger '' - speech . 
  i know this already . 
  but is there actually a provocation here ? 
  have the russians done anything recently ? 
  this suggestion is rather sudden and unexpected . 
  honestly , sounds like an improptu dick-waving competition . 
  what 's the justification for doing something so sudden and unplanned ?
