  keep in mind we 're not exactly swimming in money over here . 
  i actually think the president 's point of it not being in the budget is reasonable . 
  edit : or , yes , you could downvote me , that 's also an option . 
  you 're mentioning crimea . 
  we 've had reports of russian paramilitary in ukraine since late 2013 . 
  crimea is annexed in early 2014 . 
  the plan for the development of the armed forces is from late 2015 . 
  when i said `` recently '' , i meant in relation to that . 
  i do n't see how the annexation of crimea makes the romanian request any less untimely . 
  exactly . 
  and they also use this to excuse their laziness or incompetence . 
  this is more or less the price we pay for not living under an authoritarian government . 
  take away the excuse and they 'll find a new one . 
  the actions of the predecessor . 
  the opposition , the coalition partners , etc. 
  scapegoats are , by definition , replaceable . 
  if you believe your government is dishonest with its citizens and hides behind other institutions , you should be more afraid of removing these institutions from its path and remaining at the whim of said government . 
  hey , i like assange as much as the next guy , but this logic is ridiculous . 
  `` our politicians are using eu as a scapegoat . 
  so let 's get rid of ... the scapegoat ! '', 
  my point still stands . 
  you ca n't call the annexation by a regime that 's responsible for a genocide `` a good thing '' , because it contributed to independence . 
  there was a very good comment somewhere in this thread that compared this to being grateful to hitler for israel . 
   i have to admit that the soviet union 's annexation of western ukraine ended up being a good thing . 
  what the actual factual fuck ? 
  look , i 'm not usually one to abstain from jumping on the russophobia-bandwagon , but could we please not bash russians for being evil and imperialistic on a day that celebrates them becoming slightly less evil and imperialistic ? 
  let 's not make it any harder for the ordinary russians , that 's what the \u041a\u0420\u042b\u041c\u041d\u0410\u0428 !!,

  and the threats are only the * second * most cringy thing to come out of his mouth , believe it or not . 
  wow , i did n't know of his popularity in russia . 
  happy russia day , by the way !, 
  he 's pretty well known around here . 
  he 's part of our folklore and a frienemy to our own sly peter . 
  well , here 's a relevant tale of mulla nasreddin :  one day , nasreddin entered a village and viciously declared , `` my bag is lost -- and if you people do n't find it , you 'll find out what happened the last time my bag got lost ! ``  the villagers , quite terrified , frantically began searching for the bag . 
  minutes later , a man found it and and presented it to nasreddin . 
   out of curiosity , one of the searchers asked nasreddin , `` i was just wondering , what would you have done if we did n't find the bag ? ''  nasreddin responded , `` i would have bought a new bag ! ``, 
  never in my life have i seen a witty cartoon that has needed every element of it tagged and named . 
  but boy oh boy , this one spits in the face of subtlety , and , you know , the general idea of expressing things through a * drawing * . 
  yes , this will teach those pesky pesky germans some respect .

  you know how the ancient saying goes , `` when in rome , set fire to the fucking triclinium ! '',

  this is important , folks . 
  please make sure your [ opinion ] ( http://youcan.fixcopyright.eu/limesurvey/index.php/591338?lang=en ) on this is heard . 
  [ you see orhan , ] ( http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/753/ivan.png ) when swing sword like me , warhorse is never the battle-scare , for not having ears to hear the battle . 
  i know . 
  i was so happy to find the original version after [ i thought the bastardized version was catchy . 
  vomit-inducing lyrics aside , the melody is stolen from [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypsuxllev1e ) . 
  same awesome melody , 100 % percent less erdogan . 
  compare the video to the dances from the newest [ allahu trapbar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfu7aql3eqc ) . 
  o ** k ** , ** e ** xpla ** in ** what ** e ** lse can b ** b ** c 's f ** r ** og m ** em ** es be u ** se ** d to campaig ** n ** for ? 
  this is why you do n't let [ mc vagina ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc03hms1brk&amp;t=2m32s ) into the clergy . 
  seriously though , this has to be the funniest thing i 've learned this week , thanks !, 
  well , yeah , `` even post-coup , erdo is scarier than gulen '' is an unpopular opinion , i had it saved because of its `` told you so '' - potential . 
  not disputing that the battle for the kurdish majority is long lost for erdogan , but do you think mhp will play a big role in their decision ? 
  to the best of my knowledge there 's a rift between the mhp electrorate/lower levels of the party and bahceli & co. 
  i do n't think the nationalists themselves will be swayed by the akp-mhp alliance , much less the kurds . 
   have criticized erdo\u011fan 's regime , ** or ** have ties with the g\u00fclen movement why i 'm sure these will not be interchangeable . 
  i 'm just going to [ quote myself ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4wk4fg/how_the_west_once_again_fails_to_grasp_the/d681odi/?context=3 ) from 8 months ago , because i 'm narcissistic like that . 
  and a stupid excuse it is , no argument from me . 
  if the article was about gun control not preventing terrorism , i 'd be fine with that . 
  hell , i 'd add it 's a way for the government to appear like it 's doing something while ignoring the cause of the issue : self-segregated , self-radicalized minorities . 
  it makes sense to ignore the excuse in the context of the alarmist tone of the article and the alarmist comments in the thread . 
  like :  slap in the face of the so-called european democracy  with its vote , the european parliament decided that democracy and justice in europe do not exist , and that not all european citizens are created equal . 
  broken watches still show the correct time twice daily . 
  aaand you 're down the emotional-drivel-rabbit hole . 
   people kill people . 
  if a person wants to kill someone he can easily use a machette or a butter knife for all i know . 
  i 'll type this very slowly for you : `` a machette and a butter knife '' : 1 . have uses other than killing 2 . ca n't kill people en masse these are the things that make firearms different from knives , or cars , or anything else you compare them to while spewing nra-rhetoric . 
   yea regulate our bourbon . 
  regulate our cars . 
  people are stupid . 
  they are irresponsible . 
  only a parent like figure like a government bureaucrat is illuminated and responsible enough to put our lives in order eh ? 
  smh shhh , it 's ok . you can calm yourself now . 
  tell me , do you want to open google and type in `` drunk driving fatalities in greece '' , or should i do that for you ? 
  the definition of `` regulation '' is `` something that makes other things illegal '' . 
  if no one owed anything that would be illegal after the passing of the new regulations , what would be the point of them ? 
  you can still own firearms . 
  just not ones you can easily mow down a classroom with . 
  because , uuhhh , guns kill people ? 
  it 's wise to regulate them , like a lot of other things that can be dangerous to others , like alcohol , tobacco , pharmaceuticals , motor vehicles , etc. 
  they 're not , though . 
  they 're making the regulations more strict , it 's still possible to own guns legally , no one 's `` taking the guns away '' . 
  ok , because the article was overly emotional drivel , i need to ask : disregarding the uselessness of gun control in reducing terror attacks , why is tighter gun control bad , exactly ? 
  next day edit : shit , late-night shitposting attracts triggered americans . 
  yes , please , more !, 
  more nra talking points !, 
  cars kill people !, 
  stairs kill people !, 
  criminals do n't care about laws !, 
  why , you do n't sound retarded at all . 
  ah , upper-middle class american youth . 
  hard to pin down exactly what they stand for .
