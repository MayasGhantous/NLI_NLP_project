  for example , what is the standard for the quality of a sociological study that a news outlet can quote before becoming `` fake news '' ? 
  once you give the government the power to `` kill '' these outlets , be it through law or taxation , who will be left to police/compete with the government-approved news outlets ? 
  your outlook sounds just , i do n't know , lazy ? 
  you 're willing to delegate a job you should be doing to the government . 
  if you are worried about the spread of websites that rely on outrage-journalism and the people 's desire to see their opinions validated , should n't you encourage more and not less debate ? 
  more and not less transparent sources/studies/whatever ? 
  it 's not your government or the eu 's job to shield people from bad information . 
  i , for one , make sure i call out bad/misleading information wherever i see a circlejerk . 
  if a friend/family member/colleague shares an article from a `` fake news '' website , i make sure they have the counterpoint . 
  think about it this way : the people who do n't care about the counter arguments now will become even more closeminded and fanatical when you let the government tell them what news is real and what 's propaganda . 
  let the idiots be idiots and do n't root for laws that will turn them into useful idiots . 
  an atlas seems to be the logical progression for ben `` subtlety ? 
  labels make the cartoon '' garrison . 
  not rhyming with `` coon '' was harder than i thought it would be , fyi . 
  let 's get the good out of the way : it 's not * that * right-wing . 
  the article says the coalition has a majority of 1 seat and of the 3 parties , one is right-wing , one is centrist , and one is left-wing . 
  so , if i wanted to be optimistic , i 'd say now 's the time for the pirates to shine and show they can be a strong and capable opposition , securing themselves more seats during the next election . 
  oh , who am i kidding , they got 10 seats only , that 's super low considering that they were polling great after the panama leaks and that the reform party , a new party , managed to get 7 . 
  * cleganebowl * * the turkish coup * * the election in iceland * ah , 2016 . 
  it was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of hype , it was the age of disappointment , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of light , it was the season of darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair , we had everything before us , we had nothing before us , we were all going direct to heaven , we were all going direct the other way . 
  i 'm not sure i can give you percentages , but he owns a huge chain of kiosks that sell his media along with cigarettes , chocolate bars , lottery tickets , etc. 
  his newspapers are cheap ( i 'm talking 30 cents cheap ) and have gossip , sensationalist crap , `` tasteful '' erotica , all that good stuff to go along with the news . 
  the cheap cigarette chainsmoking , daily drinking , lottery-playing demographic seems to love his print media . 
  the putinbots posting in r/bulgaria from time to time seem to love his websites . 
   opposition parties you might be overestimating how oppositional the opposition is over here . 
  every major party is ( was ? ), 
  tied to one [ bank ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corporate_commercial_bank ) that was basically a ponzi scheme . 
  that bank 's owner was friends with peevski , then the bank went bankrupt , they manufactured some drama and are now officially not on speaking terms . 
  point is , a lot of people over here saw this bank as the mafia-bank and peevski 's media as the mafia 's mouthpiece . 
  not my fault , i found the template online and simply bulgarized it . 
  very interesting article . 
  i always thought the bad grammar was there because perfect grammar and a silly , implausible scenario do n't mix . 
  this would tip off more people . 
  broken english , on the other hand , makes you think `` oh , those wacky , naive africans and their multi-million dollar schemes . '', 
  i imagined that 's the reason why the country is more exotic as well . 
  to prey on our `` foreigners be crazy '' - mentality . 
  but your article 's theory makes a lot of sense . 
  i 'd have never thought i 'd learn such things from a discussion about trust in the european media . 
  thanks !, 
  not all , no , but a troubling amount . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delyan_peevski ) here [ handsome fella ] ( http://e-vestnik.bg/imgs/portreti_politici_bg/peevski000-1.jpg ) owns all of [ these ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xxb6bzxh-kq/uuj2tz3-2wi/aaaaaaaapme/dhuwapofwv4/s1600/nioij.png ) media outlets : websites , magazines , newspapers , radio stations , tv channels . 
  so , you know , if you ever need to consume bg-media , avoid those . 
  do n't know why you 're being downvoted , i , for one , have no idea what the situation 's like in denmark . 
  in most countries , however , letting someone filter information for you is a terrible idea . 
  and i 'd disagree over not checking the source : sure , people like circlejerks and having their opinions validated , but cross-checking and source-checking the information is only an option on the internet anyway . 
  even if the internet users who do this are in the minority of people who read news on the internet , they are still ~ 100 % of the people who cross-check and source-check . 
  also , going back to greece , they trust the internet somewhat while distrusting social media . 
  i see this as a sign of healthy skepticism . 
  the greeks who have replied have demonstrated the same , so i 'd say things are looking good for them on that front . 
   newspapers promote the political agenda/ideology of their owners same here , except it 's `` owner '' , not owners . 
  we 've even had mass protests against the guy and his business is doing just fine . 
  journalistic integrity is equally dead over here , but people , and old people in particular , still buy those rags and still trust the tv . 
  that 's why i found the results from greece so impressive . 
  maybe your compatriot is right and it 's the financial crisis that causes the difference . 
  yes , i 've been a one-man yogurt-producer many times before , thankyouverymuch . 
  i should probably stop being gross but it 's dark and -18 outside and i 'm slowly going insane . 
  well that 's depressing . 
  i was hoping for a solution that does n't involve going through an economic crisis . 
  a new perspective and appreciation for the situation here = gained . 
  dear sir : i have been requested by the bulgarian national yogurt company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter . 
  the bulgarian national yogurt company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for yogurt production in the rhodope region . 
  the contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling eur $ 40,000 ^ ^ ^ ^ ( yes , ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ amount ^ ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ ^ smaller , ^ ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ bulgaria ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ denbters ^ ^ ^ ^ ca n't ^ ^ ^ ^ be ^ ^ ^ ^ choosers ^ ^ ^ ^ anyway ) . 
  the bulgarian national yogurt company is desirous of yogurt production in other parts of the world , however , because of certain regulations of the bulgarian government , it is unable to move these funds to another region . 
  you assistance is requested as a non-bulgarian citizen to assist the bulgarian national yogurt company , and also the central bank of bulgaria , in moving these funds out of bulgaria . 
  if the funds can be transferred to your name , in your greece account , then you can forward the funds as directed by the bulgarian national yogurt company . 
  in exchange for your accommodating services , the bulgarian national yogurt company would agree to allow you to retain 1 % , or eur $ 400 of this amount . 
  however , to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to bulgarian law , you must presently be a depositor of at least eur $ 10 in a bulgarian bank which is regulated by the central bank of bulgaria . 
  if it will be possible for you to assist us , we would be most grateful . 
  we suggest that you meet with us in person in dolno nanagornishte , and that during your visit i introduce you to the representatives of the bulgarian national yogurt company , as well as with certain officials of the central bank of bulgaria . 
  please call me at your earliest convenience at 087-467-4975 . 
  time is of the essence in this matter ; very quickly the bulgarian government will realize that the central bank is maintaining this amount on deposit , and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it . 
  yours truly , prince yummy banichka, 
  ok , the unreasonably high trust in tv and lack of trust in internet i explain to myself with the aging population . 
  how does greece , a country with a higher % of elderly people than bulgaria , have such healthy attitudes towards the media ? 
  explain yourselves , greeks . 
  to be fair , i 'd sooner tug it to minecraft porn than to british chav porn . 
  in a ^ purely ^ hypothetical ^ ^ scenario ^ ^ where ^ ^ ^ i 'd ^ ^ ^ bother ^ ^ ^ ^ looking ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ minecraft ^ ^ ^ ^ porn ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ all , ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ course . 
  edit : whaddayaknow , the comment that made me reach 1000 karma is about minecraft porn . 
  [ well , off to celebrate .

  my god , i did n't know such a thing existed until now . 
  thank you . 
  also , i learned a new word today : kackpfostieren . 
  this sub 's infatuation with vigilante justice is something else . 
  last time i commented it was supporting some idiots `` defending europe '' from migrant boats . 
  now it 's beating up `` nazis '' . 
  i get the feeling even political biases are unimportant here , as long as there 's violence . 
  what ? 
  do n't you see how they 're different ? 
  your wife does n't get fat behind your back ( and breaking a vow she explicitly gave you ) , it happens gradually and right in front of you . 
  one , you 're free to divorce her at any time , you staying in the marriage is your consent . 
  two , this has nothing to do with marriage as an institution , you not liking fat women is a personal preference . 
  if she wants to be fat and you do n't , it 's a personal incompatibility . 
  your example is closer to your wife admitting she 's crushing on a coworker . 
  it 'll hurt you , you wo n't consent to it , but she 's being honest about it and is giving you the choice to accept the situation or to end the whole thing . 
  both cheating and beating are explicit actions that happen against someone 's will * and * break spousal vows ( as in , have something to do with marriage as an institution ) , both hurt someone you ( are supposed to ) love . 
  apart for the fact that violence is illegal against anyone , they 're not that morally different . 
   are you comparing consenting sex with violence ? 
  are you forgetting there 's a third party in the `` consenting sex '' you talk about ? 
  i 'm comparing two cases of hurting people close to you .
