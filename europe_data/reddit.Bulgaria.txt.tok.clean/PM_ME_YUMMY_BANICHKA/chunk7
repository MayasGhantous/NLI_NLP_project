  yes , i admit , one 's legally a crime , but focus on the moral aspect of it for a second . 
  only in one of the two will openminded westerners tell you not to judge a man by the mistakes he makes in his private life . 
  thank you !, 
  as a balkan man , it was refreshing to see my worldview validated by a westerner . 
   imo we 're very conservative about relationships in the ~ ~ angloshpere ~ ~ nonbalkansphere . 
  people of very judgmental about ~ ~ marital indiscretions ~ ~ beating your wife in the uk . 
  we make way to much about something that is absolutely the most of natural thing . 
   i find it strange that people wo n't even discuss that a sizeable percentage want to ~ ~ have sex outside their marriage ~ ~ slap their wives around during a heated argument . 
  ~ ~ affairs ~ ~ violence seem so taboo that people in the uk & us will change their entire character judgement of someone they 've known for decades just because they ~ ~ had sex with someone who was n't ~ ~ beat their spouse . 
  [ politicians , celebs and sports stars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chris_brown#domestic_violence_case ) are shamed because they ~ ~ fucked ~ ~ hit someone even though that has absolutely nothing to do with their job . 
  i do n't care about it . 
   morality always implies that it is a matter that concern society as a whole , but i could n't care less . 
  thankfully how much you care about something is completely irrelevant to the question of whether it 's a moral issue or not . 
  marriage is a contract in front of the state and upheld by society . 
  to say it 's not a moral issue and does n't concern said society is laughable . 
  if two people decide to live together , have sex and pool their resources , fine , infidelity is their business . 
  the moment they want/get their union recognized by other people , it 's a moral issue . 
  i 'll have you know my cock is rock hard , friend . 
  if you 'd only asked your mom she 'd have told you my restraint and sweet temper are confined only to my political views . 
  holy shit , you 're right , you got me there , i 'm a hypocrite !, 
  i have daily encounters with arab , black and japanese nationalists and i just leave them be . 
  i upvote every non-white nationalist post in this sub , and i see those every day . 
  smart move , copying the american trumpkin rhetoric . 
  works really well in an environment that is n't a racial melting pot . 
  do tell how bulgaria contributed to the status quo . 
  because when a guy with a dutch flag says '' ** your ** insane politics '' , i 'm thinking '' * bulgarian * insane politics '' and not `` jerks off to wilders so much that does n't even consider himself in the eu '' . 
  my mistake , i 'll know better next time . 
  also , even without nitpicking , the status quo excuse is weak as fuck . 
  one ,  responsible for the insanity of 2014 who voted for the insanity of 2014 ? 
  are you aware the problems with the definition of a refugee were long ingrained in the german constitution ? 
  two ,  responsible for the inevitable backlash or whatever will happen yeah , that 's how things work . 
  when you do or * do n't do * something , you 're responsible for everything anyone does down the line , no matter how indirect the connection between the two , no matter how many years the two are separated by , and no matter whether it was reasonable for you to foresee it . 
  not engaging in metal gymnastics here to point fingers , no siree . 
  do i need to explain what `` white nationalism '' is and how it 's different from nationalism , or are you willing to put at least a little bit of thought before typing next time ? 
  if you are n't just say so . 
  thinking is hard , i know . 
   your insane politics and what insane politics might those be ? 
   do n't think you or the ` centrists ' and whoever else do n't share in the blame yes , it makes sense to hold people accountable for the actions of other people they in no way provoked , are related to , or hold power over . 
  this is in no way blame-shifting and the_donald 's `` but the libtards '' leaking into this sub . 
  fuck me , now we have far-right groups , whoops , sorry , ** i d e n t i t a r i a n s d e n t i t a r i a n s ** , which is totally not `` white nationalists '' in code , taking matters into their own hands and the majority of the comments here are applauding it . 
  it 's just extremists turned vigilantes , you guys !, 
  what could possibly go wrong ? 
  i know , that 's why i found them funny . 
  the non-sarcastic ones ( like erdo 's ) are too close to the sad-frightening line to be amusing . 
  germans :  durch ein ** normales ** t-shirt first comment :  almanlar\u0131n yabd\u0131\u011f\u0131 a\u00e7\u0131klma yaln\u0131\u015f !, 
  ahahahahhaha , silly gavurs do n't know the power of iman . 
   if they pass us in hdi/ppp/gdp rankings in the future , our stunning governments finally wo n't have citation needed for `` well , there 's worse than us in eu ! '', 
  anymore . 
  to borrow a phrase from the spartans : ** `` if '' **, 
  do n't know whether you 're talking about the pliska rosette in general or the tangra rune in particular , but either way , no . 
  nationalists and patriotards appropriating a symbol does n't make it a hate symbol . 
  nor does it mean it should be `` given '' to them . 
  this is n't like the swastika and nazi germany , these people do n't hold any institutional power . 
  patriotards generally look to the past for symbols to use as their own . 
  if you start to surrender everything some random schmucks appropriate , your country will find itself without any non-nazi historical symbols in no time . 
  it 's rare to find a contribution with so much skill * and * thought put into it . 
  every country 's flag is interesting and symbolic , on top of being visually gorgeous . 
  there is not a single flag among the ones you 've sumbitted ( not even the lithuanian one ) that i would n't prefer to the original . 
  saving your post just so i can show it to people to explain what i like about minimalist designs in general . 
  amazing work . 
  oh man , kilicdaroglu and the eu court will be a match made in heaven . 
  the kilicdar , looking sad : `` olur mu boyle bi sey ? '', 
  eu court , in a strongly worded advisory opinion : `` olmaz boyle bi sey ! '', 
  good idea !, 
  could be an insidious plan on siemens ' part . 
  the turbines are already operating at a loss in poland . 
  maybe it 's an effort to further fuck up crimea 's economy . 
   have we been bombing eastern european states for the past couple of decades ? 
  [ yes , you have , you fucks , now give me the address of your family so i may go and behead them . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_sofia_in_world_war_ii ) it 'll also be hilarious if the perpetrators are 2nd/3rd generation immigrants , as most of them are . 
  `` their country '' is the uk . 
  anyway , i started the whole thing by pointing out religious terrorism is quite different from political terrorism . 
  one has a certain political goal it wants to achieve . 
  the other does not . 
  will you point me to specific demands islamists have ( you know , other than total subjugation of people not sharing their ideology ) , will you maybe show me specific actions the uk government has undertaken recently to provoke the attacks , or are you going to keep making false equivalences with the troubles ? 
  ok . let 's assume the higher-ups have a complicated plan for recruiting people that involves the rise of far-right nationalism . 
  kinda counter-intuitive , kinda conspiratorial , definitely is n't the motive of the perpetrator , but ok . 
  the question remains : when are we going to stop blaming our society for the radicalization of the muslim minorities and admit that it 's them who hold the responsibility to not self-radicalize ? 
  why are we not trying hard enough to prevent the spread of religious extremism and are instead spewing `` not all muslims '' - bullshit ? 
  why are we trying to not offend the sensibilities of people who might feel connected to the terrorists by their religion and not expecting them to take a good hard look at their religious beliefs and root out the shit that attracts psychos ? 
  why are we behaving like it 's the most normal and expected thing in the world for a marginalized minority to turn to extremism and terrorism ? 
  did brits also fear that ukip 's rhetoric might lead to eastern europeans blowing themselves up in public places , or do people have such fears only when it comes to a certain group of people ? 
  people who are both super peaceful and have nothing to do with the terrorists , but are two steps away from religious extremism at any given time ? 
  lastly , with the increasing number of islamic terror attacks in the recent years , are n't the muslims doing and a + job of self-radicalizing even without our help ? 
  in short : even if `` fear and polarizing society '' appears in the higher-ups ' plans , so what ? 
  it 's just a publicity stunt , bro !, 
  the point of religiously motivated terrorism is to kill you . 
  allah rewards such action . 
  you 're making it sound like the terrorists are in pursuit of a political goal . 
  they are not . 
  this is what makes islamic terror different from , say , red terror . 
   no , no they do n't . 
  they do it for publicity . 
  hey , i 'm glad you know how things really are . 
  publicity must be the reason why they kill muslims in rural areas in the middle east . 
  you know , the vast , vast majority of isis ' victims . 
  these get a ton of publicity . 
   they want us ** ultimately ** scared . 
  really ? 
  * ultimately * scared ?
