  got ta take that 5th term and turn the country to republican dictatorship . 
  \\ + in the end you get that big 6/6/6 ruler, 
  tzykanion is the shit, 
  and romanians are true ~ ~ roma ~ ~ romans, 
  prepare your asshole, 
  its ok . you can annex kosovo and montenegro , we are not interested in those guys, 
  k but if there 's future greece vs turkey war we are taking odrin , deal ? 
  one of my grandfathers used to drive k700 . 
  some years ago when i showed him this video he simply said `` i 've been in worse situations '' also both tanks are 600l and they are just enough for one shift ( 12hr ) . 
  russia does n't give a fuck about global warming, 
   ceuta which wanted to remain as part of spain . 
  the city is under spanish rule for 300 or so years but the coa is still using the portuguese flag . 
  also one of the longest sieges in history is the siege of ceuta for 20 + years . 
  lame as fuck i 'm waiting for the russian and french parades . 
  oh and thanks . 
  maybe its time for [ anschluss ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/bulgaria-sanstefano_-%281878%29-bytodorbozhinov.png ) ? 
  i like to call them nazis / s, 
  huh til, 
   e.u that ` sa weird way to type the eu . 
  idk its just really strange to me, 
  i think i 've seen french trains with mirrors . 
  no idea if that 's common in europe tho, 
  romans - red ferrari - red flag - red stripe national football teams color - blue what the fuck italy ? 
  around 80 maybe ? 
  idk . 
  the thing ca n't go over 100 that 's for sure . 
  today the 32/33 series ( like the one on the pic ) are almost completely retired and [ siemens desiro ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/desiro_on_the_sofia-lakatnik_line%2c_14_february_2012.jpg ) are used on the routes .

   we lost it to russians soviets . 
  you lost it to russians/georgians/armenians / belorussians/ukrainians/kazakhs / turkmens ... 
  both try to portray brexit as '' our side is the bestest , fuck you if you do n't think like us '' so yea both are shit, 
  soon to be beheaded, 
  i agree about the others but pussyriot were complete retards . 
  \\  go back to 4chan you fucking degenerate amirite ?? 1 ? 1 ?? 1 ?

  there are places in bg that look like the one in the movie . 
  mostly in the gypsy neighborhoods tho, 
  [ '' dear sweet mother of god ... we 're in eastern europe !, 
  '' ] ( https://youtu.be/cqese-ikbi8?t=1m46s ), 
  you 're joking but some neo-nazis claim to be aryans cause '' we have aryan in our name '' \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433-\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f ( \u0410\u0440\u0438\u044f = \u0410\u0440\u0438\u0439\u0446\u0438 ) i know it makes no sense but yea people can be very stupid sometimes, 
  death solves all problems - no man no problem, 
  imo more like serbia , montenegro 2023/2025 bih , albania , macedonia 2028 + moldova 2030-2035 ukraine is fucked so i 'd say 2040 or even 2050 + massive corruption , shit politicians , war in the country , economy ruined completely , no prospects for fast recovery . 
   iceland & norway are wildcards , switzerland will likely never join , and neither will the micronations . 
  agree  belarus seems to be moving towards europe slowly , but the real question will be how badly russia gets fucked in the next few years , and what will happen with lukashenko . 
  lukashenko is relatevely young so if he lives to see his 80s that would mean another 20 + years for him as president . 
  imo if somebody like putin rules russia when he dies i think russia annexing belarus would also be a possability ( they are already in a bunch of unions ) georgia , armenia , azerbaijan - probably never russia - never turkey 's main problem is something that is not much talked about here and that 's religion . 
  with ~ 80 mil . 
  population they would become the second strongest with prospects to become the strongest country in the eu . 
  something that would drive the populists to the top in every eu election . 
  its not completely impossible for turkey to join the eu but they would need ataturk 2.0 for that to happen . 
  things can change massively ofc . 
  for example if ukraine gets the war solved in the next 2 years and if they get some godly non-corrupt ministers to rule the country i can see them easily as a eu member in 2030 but knowing the eastern mentality i doubt that will happen . 
   mr czech republic mr czechia, 
  nah you 're mistaken \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430 was a famous bulgarian inventor, 
  put one '' / s '' there yo even me as a non-greek and as a guy with nationality that should be hating the greeks am a little bit triggered to see alex 's nationality questioned . 
  [ #hanslivesmatter ] ( http://freehansisland.com/ ), 
  ok muslim greece, 
   leader of eu tusk and juncker are the leaders of the eu . 
  israel and greece would probably commit masada 2.0 before they surrender to turkey/muslims, 
  do n't worry little spain, 
  in one of your so-called ` crusades ' you guys also went ` shopping ' in constantinople, 
  is '' szkwarek '' your last name ? 
  i 'm asking cause i have seen a guy on facebook with the same name ( and roughly the same views as yours ) and i 've been wondering if thats you ... iirc his name was kristian on his profile pic he was holding a skull or something . 
  \\  jerusalem \\  turkey pick one, 
  from 79.5 to 66 . 
  thats like 15 % drop in 5 years, 
  put some milk in a bowl warm it put some bread in the bowl ( break it to pieces before that ) add some sugar mix the whole thing till the bread is all wet eat enjoy your popara, 
  maybe we should visit a beer hall or something, 
  technically he is correct . 
  on the map its written as \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0438\u043c ( republic of crimea ) . 
  back when crimea was part of ukraine it was known as ` autonomous republic of crimea ' so when they declared their '' '' '' independence '' '' '' they simply dropped the * autonomous * from their name and joined russia as ` republic of crimea ', 
  you misspelled tsarigrad . 
  we should start a second serbo-bulgarian war to see if god is serbian or bulgarian the winner takes the title `` god is ... '' and the right to have rakija patented as national drink . 
  if those 3/5/10 shitty op-eds on rt managed to convince the public in britain to change from '' pro-eu '' to '' brexit '' i 'd eat a fucking trabant like that pig from crna macka , bel kotarak . 
  the truth is that the eu was never liked that much in britain and the poor handling of the migrant crisis was the thing that broke them to vote leave . 
  ok i know its a dumb question and i know nobody is gon na answer it but why is your election on wednesday ? ... 
  i mean why not on saturday or sunday when most of the people are not working, 
  eti shit is the best . 
  cutting relations like that would probably the dumbest decision every country can take . 
  the problem is not your average ahmet ( except the crazies ofc ) , the problem is their fucked up president and the people around him . 
  people still download games/films like crazy in bg i do n't know if we have any laws against piracy but even if we doimplementing them would mean throwing every 10 to 40 yo person in jail . 
   xhaka how do you even pronounce that, 
  man it feels good to be in the eu, 
  i had to google 10min to find what are you talking about and finally thanks to one guy who filmed himself with the unasur logo on twitteri managed to find the organisations wiki article, 
  give us those 4 % and in the next election you will see 40 % of the electorate vote going to anti-eu parties, 
   quite good i know a guy who worked 15 years illegally in germany . 
  if those 1mil . 
  immigrants want to stay in germany your ` zoll ' would n't be able to do shit . 
  [ it 'll be hard to remove putin who is leading with 50 % over the other guys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opinion_polling_for_the_russian_presidential_election,_2018 ) maybe if he retires but i doubt it oh and btw the next guy is even more unpredictable and crazy than putin  he ( vladimir zhirinovsky ) is fiercely nationalist and has been described as `` a showman of russian politics , blending populist and nationalist rhetoric , anti-western invective and a brash , confrontational style '' . 
  [ 1 ] his views have been described as fascist . 
  [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] guys is a fucking nutjob i recommend his [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_zhirinovsky ), 
  is catalunya really going to secede tho, 
  well make them both great, 
  make euskara great again mega, 
  basil ii was also one of the best byzantine emperors guy was on fucking fire, 
  its usually the neo-nazi/nationalist / '' we are not slav '' people who say shit like that .
