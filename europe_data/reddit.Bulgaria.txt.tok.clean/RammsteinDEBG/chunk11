  '' the russians stole our alphabet '' and '' we gave those swine the alphabet '' are also heard frequently on some fb pages/groups . 
  how to trigger all bulgarians : kingdom of * macedonia *, 
   ~ ~ russian ~ ~ bulgarian or polish there are some people in bulgaria who believe russian is nothing more than '' old ( ish ) bulgarian '' . 
  those guys even think they stole our language . 
  huh interesting i thought you do n't like eachother and seeing 17k jews in turkey looked like a big no no to me, 
  am i the only one surprised to see 17 000 jews still living in a muslim country ? 
  i mean i have nothing against turkey but in the 50/60/70s muslims and jews were not best terms, 
  \\  turkey \\  lower crime stats, 
  yep . 
  the level of russia is probably put by somebody who thought '' russia needs to be lower in our chart '' . 
  munich or frankfurt ? 
  both are in more centrist position and both are big developed cities, 
  so if you say '' erdogan is a dictator '' and i send your messages to the turkish police you 'd get in trouble ? 
  like ... they would really care what a random guy said on american shitposting board ? 
  if another migrant wave hits europe all proposials would fail but scenario 3 and letting countries participate in whatever they want is the best imo ... scenario 5 would lead to more '' eu is evil oppressor '' and '' eu is trying to eradicate our national identity '' which i think would lead to more populist parties and if something big happens ( eg . 
  migrants ) that might be the end of the eu scenario 4 is ok but if one country wants more funding/research in one direction and the eu says '' nah that out of our reach '' that would n't be good for the country that wanted it scenario 2  `` this may widen the gap between expectations and delivery at all levels . '', 
  which would lead to '' eu is not helping us '' or '' why is this eu even existing '' - bad thing for the eu scenario 1 '' current situation '' is trying to combine all of the above and that leads to very slow reactions and reacting slowly and trying to eat more than you can take is a big no imo, 
  imagine the bordergore if rep srpska joins serbia [ ugh the horror ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/bosnia_and_herzegovina%2c_administrative_divisions_-_en_%28entities%29_-_colored.svg ) ... 
  shes def above average i 'm sure those 700 000 likes on her fb page did not come cause she is very competent in whatever she is doing, 
  they speak ~ ~ serbo-croatian ~ ~ montenegrin i have downvoted / u/jtalin 11 times mountainous one montenegrin tried to convince me they are illyrians . 
  i consuder them slavs but idk if they believe in their illyrian heritage so much attacked us in 1913 even tho they gained nothing poor like us they are not in the eu but they use the euro anyway nice weather cool flag, 
  serbia has more pro-russian people and generally has friendly relations with russia . 
  on the other hand / r/europe sees russia as an absolute hell . 
  that 's why . 
  correct me if i 'm wrong but in 1707 ( ? ), 
  england and scotland united in one kingdom ( kingdom of great britain ) then in 1801 ( ? ), 
  the kingdom of gb and the kingdom of ireland formed '' united kingdom of great britain and ireland '' and finally in 1922 ( ? ), 
  the uk got its current name ( united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland ) so my question is if ni joins the rest of ireland will the uk keep its current name ( united kingdom of gb and xxxx ( wales maybe ? 
  lol ) or the country would have to go back to its pre-1801 name ( kingdom of great britain ) ? 
  language is a massive barrier + we are not belgium and nationalists will ruin the fun . 
  yea total mad . 
  tbh i expect the us to react the same way if trump is imprisoned by russia ( actually that might be a good thing for reddit lol ), 
  we 'd definitely want some sort of '' territorial compensation '' if greece takes constantinople * looks eagerly at fyrom and edirne *, 
  every european city with a population of over 100 000 will be melted to glass if somebody like the president of russia gets imprisoned by an eu country . 
  2,50 bgn ( ~ 1,25 eur ) in bg, 
  jesus look at macedonia and kosovo i 'm not saying we are n't fucked but these guys are on a whole new level . 
  never heard/read about them . 
  3-5 % margin of error is pretty normal, 
  russia is seen as the only country that can stop turkey if something bad happens in ~ ~ sultan ~ ~ erdogans head + we have strong cultural and historic ties . 
  felipe takes the title '' emperor of hispania '' then he 'll give the title '' kindgom of portugal '' to one of the existing bragancas and the problem is solved !, 
  10/10 you guys should totally do this ^ ^ it ^ ^ worked ^ ^ for ^ ^ me ^ ^ in ^ ^ ck2, 
  if bulgaria gets the eaa we would make it the most corrupt agency in the eu, 
  rod blagojevich is a south slav ... 
  corruption is in his veins . 
  kek, 
  german efficiency - celebrate quietly for ten minutes then go back to work . 
  if that was in italy or spain the whole world would know ( or europe at least ), 
  me is maine , ia is iowa , dc is washington ( district of columbia ) and la i guess is louisiana no idea about the postal codes tho e : according to google 00820 is from the vigin islands and 99600 is a village in lapland . 
  the only us code i know is 90210, 
  depends . 
  which country do you like more russia or usa ? 
  if your answer is '' russia '' --  some shit building in st. petersburg if your answer is '' usa '' --  shareblue , ctr or contact david brock both will probably give you enough money for beer and you might even be able to work from your home, 
   when was the last time an european country annexed another european country during peace time ? 
  russia did not annex all of ukraine . 
  crimea did declare independence from ukraine but they only did it to use the '' kosovo precedent '' . 
  if we do n't count crimea the last time '' one european country annexed another peacefully '' was in 1990 when west germany annexed east germany, 
  jesus this is becoming a thing on / r/reurope, 
  k den we will form a union with romania, 
  what would happen with / r/moldova if they go back to romania, 
  damn dude lol btw whats that blue tower on your name, 
  i 'd rather have western thrace tbh if i had the power to change our borders i 'd take bulgaria after the first balkan war [ \\ ( map link \\ ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/prima_guerra_balcanica.bg.png ) . 
  adding macedonia would n't give us any benefits + they got lots of young folks angry with their constant '' samuil is macedonian '' , '' bulgari - tatari '' so uh yea , no thanks . 
  1 . post this to / r/nottheonion 2 . get free karma, 
  the only slavic country i 'd like to live in . 
  we kicked your asses here romanian plebs, 
  the cave has taught me to stay away from any romanian caves and abandoned churches, 
  '' \u0427\u0435\u0445\u0438\u044f '' in bg '' \u0427\u0435\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 '' is also used sometimes ( mostly in documents and such ), 
   how is your relationship with your family ? 
  good , not ideal but good anyway . 
   is the american culture of being independent from the family prevalent in europe ? 
  in the eastern europe - not really . 
  here some people live with their parents house until they all die and the house is theirs lol . 
  the west are way more independent than us easterners . 
   do mothers nag you every week ? 
  i have n't seen mine is 10 years so nah  how close are you with extended family ? 
  i once had drunk sex with my third cousin ... 
  i guess we are close . 
  idk, 
   how do you feel about `` ever closer union '' meh ... 
  i 'd rather have closer ties with my neighbors ( eg the craiova group , v4 ) than a full massive eu country . 
   if bureaucracy in eu is replaced by political leadership , ( elections for head of eu ) , will it help union or damage it we already have elections for the parliament . 
  i expect the same low results as always . 
  people are simply uneducated about the eu and they 'll not give a fuck even if every position is electable . 
   how real is threat of far right in eu , will these parties take over france and germany in next elections ? 
  i ca n't speak for other countries but as a half-bg , half-de i have got to say i do n't expect any massive political changes in both countries . 
  there are some populist parties who managed to get % of the votes but i do n't expect this to be anything serious . 
  if le pen wins tho , the situation might change dramatically . 
   are you impacted by brexit anyway . . not really . 
  i had some plans to move to the uk because i know some people who are in my line of work but looking at the current situation i 'd rather wait for the storm to pass . 
   do you see turkey as part of eu or not with erdogan - no , without him - no . 
  overall - no .

  can of coca cola is seriously not cool .
