  heh you 're welcome, 
  [ as a bulgarian i know i should be hating the greeks for what they did but tbh i 'm kinda sad greece lost the yellow areas ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/greekhistory.gif ) ^ ^ do n't ^ ^ hate ^ ^ me ^ ^ i ^ ^ play ^ ^ too ^ ^ much ^ ^ eu4 . 
  / u/cosmic _ dong received some 3rd degree burns there . 
  i think we should call 112, 
  cycling in -10 c with summer clothing ( sandals,-tshirt etc ) is my favorite . 
  my people think i 'm crazy but i do n't give a fuck . 
  that 's the best time to ride a bike .

    crimea declared independence from ukraine before the annexation ,  no [ yea but they kinda ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_independence_of_the_republic_of_crimea ) [ did exactly what he said ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_crimea#/media/file:merge-independence-and-separation-of-crimea.png ), 
  we are definitely waaaaaaay more butthurt about what happened in 1913 after the second balkan war than what the ruskies gave to romania in 1878 . 
  both butthurts are not even on the same scale . 
  [ bulgaria is not fighting with greece , serbia , romania , turkey and montenegro ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_balkan_war ) i ca n't believe this . 
  born in 97 its half of my life, 
  russian is 50/50 to us . 
  i 'm not sure how much the russians understand us , but if they speak slowly and clearly , i think most bulgarians will get what they are trying say . 
  of course this is only valid if they speak only '' basic '' stuff and nothing academical . . as for speaking , russian is more in the '' i can kinda say some words and some sentences '' category and unless you 've taken classes you 'll never be able to speak '' understandable '' russian . 
  if you are bulgarian i think the only language that you can safely put in your resume as a second language is macedonian , serbian too if you live in the northwestern bg .

  whew ... thanks hungary . 
  bros for life, 
  if you are rich russia can be a nice place to live in, 
  yea but it is mostly children who play games, 
  southern dobrudja is romanian lol seeing vidin romanian is even bigger lol, 
  i just wanted to make it more deadly . 
  no idea if that 's a real medical thing, 
  in february trump dies barrack comes for a third term due to popular uprising the queen dies in april and the uk is thrown in a short civil war ( englandvsscotland ) . 
  one of the peace conditions would be william to be crowned as king not his father le pen wins in france in may merkel and 75 other people would die when a car bomb blows the reichstag in june putin dies from a massive heart attack and the country is thrown into chaos , medvedev eventually is elected in august the pope dies and his successor would also die 25 days later cause he will be killed by a lone terrorist . 
  in november denmark will attack sweden for no reason by the end of the year isis would have most of syria and iraq erdogan allies isis and declares his intention to conquer the balkans the eu is renegotiated , schengen and the euro are abolished and the union is turned into a purely trade one nato is also renegotiated but not drastically i ca n't really think of a more damaging 2017 . 
  switched from '' last christmas '' to '' all i want for christmas is you '' cause when i learned that he is dead something totally killed my holiday mood . 
   would it be ok if crimea first separated and 15 seconds later chose to reunite with russia ? 
  this is what they did . 
  they declared independence and some days later they joined russia . 
  that only happens in the gypsy ghetto . 
  \\  gay guy got drunk with friends . 
  \\  he went to his room but for some reason his grandma was sleeping there . 
  \\  no idea what went through his head but he tried to force his grandma to have sex with him ( aka he tried to rape her ) . 
  \\  grandpa wakes up . 
  \\  grandpa sees what 's going on and kicks the guy out of the house ( some people say that chainsaws were involved but i can not confirm ) . 
  \\  police is called , according to my uncle ( who is a policeman and told me the story ) they took the gay guy for 24h and did some '' standard '' procedures on him ( aka . 
  24h non stop beating ) \\  i 've not seen the gay guy for years . 
  northern siberia ( aka .2 / 3 of siberia ) is nearly all perma/near-perma frost or land that 's in only useful of logging and nothing else . 
  there are some exceptions ( norilsk , vorkuta ) but as i understand those cities are build there to mine the rich materials that are near them . 
  most of the population of siberia lives in the south ( iirc novosibirsk , the third largest city in russia is near the kazakhstan-mongolia border ) because the conditions and climate there are better . 
  itt : '' crimea is not russia '' if they had abkhazia and s. ossetia marked as russian you would all be calling pres. 
  obama to nuke russia . 
  calm down people it is just a map . 
  jesus ... heh the downvotes, 
  gypsy mother . 
  the guy is still in school ( last year i think ) . 
  i do n't know if he plans to go to uni but i think finishing hs is n't that bad and it 's surely an improvement . 
  her daughter also finished hs and had children when she was 20 . 
  compared to how most of the gypsy girls get married at 15 i think that 's also a big improvement . 
  i know that 's just one in a thousand but it 's something . 
  ofc i also know a gay gypsy guy who almost fucked his grandmother but that 's another story ... 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banat_republic with some imagination you can have another country in the balkans, 
  we think most brits are fat and ugly tbh, 
  i live near gypsies . 
  they are actually better than most bulgarians . 
  i 've seen a mother beating the shit out of her 16yo son just because he ran from school . 
  we had to separate them because she was absolutely destroying the guy . 
  but he is turkish ... you do n't have jesus in turkey, 
  not enough norse runes put some '' \u00d0\u00f0 '' and '' \u00de\u00fe '' in there, 
  '' mods of / r/europe are opressing free speech ! '', 
  t_d when they learn about this, 
  [ dis gon na be gut ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/6zxomthimzogw/giphy.gif ), 
  at least the son will have some memories with him and will hopefully remember his father as a hero . 
  from personal experience i can tell you that losing a parent at a young age is one of the most brutal things life can give you . 
  he went to ireland to supply ira with weapons and explosives, 
  i was wondering if its written as `` buggati '' or `` bugatti '' so i just left it with one g and t. lol, 
  '' i 'm sorry son , i barely had any money to buy a new-ish video card '' upgrading from 9400gt to something like gtx 770 feels like upgrading from lada to bugati . 
  zero or not i 'm nearly 100 % sure that we would not be active participant in such war . 
  we would rather see bulgarians volunteering to fight with the russian army than bulgarians willing to fight on the turkish side if russiavsturkey conflict erupts . 
  turkey is in nato tho ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ would n't ^ ^ ^ really ^ ^ ^ rush ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ help ^ ^ ^ turkey ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ russia ^ ^ ^ attacks ^ ^ ^ them ... 
   mount olympus ( / o\u028a\u02c8l\u026amp\u0259s , \u0259 - / ; [ 3 ] greek : \u038c\u03bb\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ; also transliterated as olympos , and on greek maps , oros olympos ) is the highest mountain in greece and the second highest mountain in the balkans . 
  -  rila ( bulgarian : \u0420\u0438\u043b\u0430 , pronounced [ \u02c8ri\u026b\u0250 ] ) is a mountain range in southwestern bulgaria and the highest mountain range of bulgaria and the balkans , with its highest peak being musala at 2,925 m. we beat you in this category, 
  i expected a balkan war over the word ` nis ' . 
  i 'm disappointed . 
  that looks german af, 
  idk the windows give me that 80s feel, 
  tbh that bear looks homo as fuck, 
  dont forget to add rakija, 
  iceland ? 
  if we ignore the whole politics/far-right/nazi thing i 'd gladly make some porn vids with them \\ + they are a bit crazier and that would make the whole experience better heh the downvotes, 
  croatia can stop you if you have any territorial disputes as for kosovo ... well ... 
  i guess the eu would probably say something like '' integration and closer ties blah blah '' and the whole thing will probably stay like todays situation, 
  `` rakija , the balkan way '' is missing too mods better take notes and fix this in 2017, 
  great idea and great corruption scheme . 
  too bad the greek hellenic gods did not survive to modern times . 
  i 'd totally convert to them, 
  promotion is something that is really needed in the eu . 
  according to their site if you live in eea/eu and eu candidate country you do n't have to pay the delivery too, 
  we fuck their women when they come here in the summer , they fuck us when we go there heh seems like a fair deal to me, 
  why is morocco ` rotten ' ?
