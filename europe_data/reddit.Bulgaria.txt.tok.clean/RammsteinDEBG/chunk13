  no problem man, 
   bulgars are the guys who came with khan asparukh in the 7th century . 
  currently we have a lot of slav genes and we are not exactly like them anymore, 
  damn the queen was a total babe back then, 
  western swedes, 
  \\  putin is a great leader . 
  \\  posted on / r/europe good luck , lol . 
  i like nickelback . 
  i try to follow the `` we all hate nickelback '' internet circlejerk but i really like them . 
  i even have two yt playlists with their songs, 
   fidel castro , khrushchev and abkhazia on / r/europe you 're a brave man , op . 
  mine is 3gb ` fast ' and when that 's over you can buy more ` fast ' internet or you can use the unlimited ` slow ' net ( no hidden costs ofc ) this + a sim card with some unlimited mins costs me around 10 euros/month, 
   \u0423\u0439 is not a dick in the famous northwest we use mostly ' \u0443\u0439 ' . 
  ' \u0425\u0443\u0439 ' is also used but it sounds too formal for our taste, 
  `` yo hans put some more green shit on it to mask the awful smell '', 
   `` finds a european girlfriend ''  `` she is from belarus '' this can be a good ` bad luck brian ' meme, 
  oh yea i missed that part maybe they are into that homogay stuff who am i to judge them lol, 
  germany wished to send poland and all polish people to jesus in the 1940s but everybody said no, 
  looks like the norse slav wife stealing during the viking ages turned those scandinavians into 1/4 slavs welcome to the slav society norway , sweden and iceland, 
  ireland lost a bit of land there, 
  \\  nova roma \\  true foundation name ( byzantium ) pick one, 
  that red dot in romania, 
   godzina remove that z and you 've got the word `` year '' in bulgarian, 
  the vatican should have jesus christ as ` ceremonial ' president, 
  damn you flair is so beautiful, 
   police chick now you got my attention, 
  i always try to keep byzantium and trebizond as a marches when i play with the ottomans . 
  eu4 is great, 
   anel what a shitty name, 
  not surprised tbh . 
  polls were giving him over 5 % to win long before the election . 
  lets see if boyko gives his resignation now edit : yep the madman did it . 
  holy fuck now is my time to get in the parliament . 
  kek / r/the _ rammstein, 
  alright i can kinda agree with the politics ( but that uk example is bad imo )  geographically , not really ? 
  but if we agree with the ural-caucasus european borders , then russia is the biggest country in europe ... `` eurasian '' is perhaps the best to call russia ( its not so much about the culture but the massive siberian land ) but still claiming that russia is not european ( like the ops picture ) is absurd . 
  i 'd rather have it filled with windfarms ( on the water ) tbh, 
  kursk was new actually . 
  iirc the sub was launched somewhere in the early 90s . 
  how the fuck is russia not european ? 
  culturally - check geographically - big parts of the country are , so check politically - they are interested in europe , so check population - mostly in europe , check religious - check history - check i get it that we all should hate russia , but that `` russia is not european '' is ridiculous . 
  i 'm not the only one who sees a human figure ... 
  that 's more like morocco pov, 
  bhahahaha, 
  i think bulgaria looks more like a lion or tiger ( a bit overweight ) but a cat is ok too . 
  [ according to cnn from 2002 ] ( http://transcripts.cnn.com/transcripts/0210/07/i_ins.01.html )  at one stage , yeltsin had an approval rating of only 2 percent . 
  mr. putin 's approval ratings are over 70 . 
  russians think of putin as being kind of boring in comparison to the colorful president yeltsin , but after so many years of excitement , boring and predictable , they say , is good . 
  read the whole thing . 
  i think its really interesting, 
  / r/politics and a few other '' anti-trump '' subs would be all over / r/all if the title was something like `` opinion poll 36 % of americans view trump favorably . '', 
  nobody can beat yeltsin and his 2 %, 
  that 's even worse imo . 
  with his control over everything he ca n't say '' the opposition was stopping me from doing xyz reform '' . 
  if he fails he ca n't blame anybody . 
   you vote for parliament , they appoint the president . 
  this is how it works in almost every democracy . 
  what ? 
  its normal in other countries not to elect the president ? 
  i have to side with the eu sceptics here cause what the eu is doing is undemocratic . 
  e : also pm = / = president e2 : looks like i hurt some euphile feels here, 
  i 'm amazed you know so much about bg history, 
  answering some misses in no particular order  they regained independence in a joint bulgarian-romanian ( vlachian ) tax revolt in the late 12th century , somewhere after 1180 ( death of manuel comnenos ) , i 'm guessing around 1190 or so . 
  1185 is generally accepted as the start of the revolt . 
  the leaders ivan and his brother peter are considered by some to be of cuman/pecheneg descent but that did n't stop them to pursue the interests of bulgaria of course . 
  the third brother kaloyan won recognition of his '' tsar '' title by the pope in 1204 and he managed to capture the latin emperor in the battle of adrianopolis a year later . 
   many bulgarian muslims ( called pomraks , i think ? ), 
  most are in the rhodope mountains and yes pomaks and bulgaromohamedani ( lit . 
  bulgarian mohammedanians lol ) are the names . 
  though i think the second is used as an offensive term . 
   they did however save the byzantines once : during the umayyad siege of constantinople in 717 ( not 100 % sure about the year ) , they repeatedly harassed the arab forces , contributing to their suffering and eventual retreat . 
  717 and 718 are both accepted . 
   their capital is sofia ( ancient serdica , which was actually held by the byzantines after the initial slavic migrations and until iirc the late 8th century , not sure how though ) . 
  in 809 krum took the city from the byzantines and the byzantines in response organised their ill fated campaign against bulgarian capital pliska in 811 which finished with the battle of varbishki pass ? 
  ( i know the name but i ca n't say it properly ) and the death of the byz emperor nikephoros and his son stavrakii ( staurakios ? ), 
  a few months later . 
  so yeah 9th century . 
   in 2007 or 2008 , they joined the eu together with romania . 
  they joined nato too , probably some years before this since the requirements are n't as difficult . 
  2004 for nato and 2007 for the eu  in 1989 or 1990 the communist regime was overthrown as in most of eastern europe and bulgaria became capitalist . 
  10th of november 1989  they suffered ottoman conquest somewhere in the very late 1300 's or very early 1400 's ( but i 'm leaning more toward the former ) . 
  1396 was the fall of the vidin kingdom and is officially recognised as the year when bulgaria was destroyed . 
  some people believe the kingdom actually survived as some sort of ottoman vassal up until the 1420s but i think there was n't enough evidence to confirm or deny that . 
  i 'd take them we can also take their grand duke as our ruler and we can up his title from '' duke '' to '' tsar '' . 
  '' tsar henri i of bulgaria '' sounds shit af tho , so maybe he should change his name to ivan or georgi first . 
  was n't there one guy who said he eats only on the eiffel tower because that 's the only time he does n't see it, 
  and we are winning in nearly all battles, 
   between greece , turkey , romania and serbia macedonia confirmed bulgarian  bulgars were a turkic tribes that split into 2 groups : one remained on volga , the other one moved south of the danube some stayed to face the khazars , some moved to volga ( near kazan ) , some moved to modern day bulgaria and got assimilated and some went to places like pannonia and even italy . 
   it caused 2 balkan wars i 'm not sure if we were the first ones to declare war on the ottomans in the first balkan war , but even if we fbw was more of a allied effort . 
   more developed than you 'd think given its limited resources and history ... 70 and more % of everything you see in the cities is pre 1989 when the soviets were pumping stuff like crazy to keep their ~ ~ puppets ~ ~ comrades happy , so today we are n't really all that developed . 
  1913 backstabbing never forget, 
  simple google search gives me the price in that district at 1800-1900 $ for one square meter so lets say you buy a normal 80 sq. m apt with three or four rooms 80x1850 = ~ 148 000 $, 
  girl on pic 25 got some nice legs everything else looks weak af tho, 
  time to play crusader kings again i guess, 
  / r/mapswithoutolivenca, 
  another poor country is exactly what the eu needs right now . 
  i 'd even say the next two decades, 
  [ kate is better ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catherine,_duchess_of_cambridge ), 
  fuck no . 
  something something translation maybe i barely speak engish and you expect me to know latin ?
