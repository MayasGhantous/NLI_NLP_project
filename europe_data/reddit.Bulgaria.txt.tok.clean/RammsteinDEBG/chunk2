  i mean he would control our country 2x better than the 240 fat fucks we have right now .

   how often are you on reddit in an average week ? 
  2-3 hours everyday  how often do you visit / r/europe ? 
  about an hour everyday sometimes two if there 's something interesting  what country are you normally resident in ? 
  bulgaria  do you speak any languages besides english ? 
  ( if yes : which and to what level ? ), 
  bulgarian  what interests you about europe ? 
  politics and culture  what are your favourite and least favourite things about / r/europe ? 
  mostly culture related things . 
  strong circlejerks and posting the same news again and again . 
   do you have experience as a moderator or similar ? 
  no  why do you want to be a moderator ? 
  i want to ban all mods and be the only vozhd here . 
   why do you think you would be a good moderator ? 
  gon na be interesting to see myself fail after two months . 
  or to see threads how i act like comrade stalin . 
  i 've never been a mod so i really do n't know if i 'm the best or not . 
   do you have any expirence with statistics , datamining or reddit bots ? 
  no  what is your opinion on the immigration megathread ? 
  what do you think went wrong ( if anything ) ? 
  you ca n't contain such a big thing with some megathreads . 
  of course spamming the whole front is also not an option . 
  compromise is needed here i think megathreads are only useful when something really big is happening ( like the charlie hebdo attack )  what 's one weakness you have ? 
  i brush my teeth once every day not twice and thanks to reddit and steam i went from 73kg to 82kgs in 6 months . 
   would you rather fight one horse sized duck or one hundred duck sized horses ? 
  i 'd fight 100 horse sized putins . 
   what single word connects all of these three of the following words : europe , pussy cat , teacher ? 
  \\* [ beethoven intensifies ] ( https://youtu.be/bvl7glwzct0?t=6m56s ) * bye, 
  northwestern bg - poor as fuck , we have crazy accent and unless you have c2 profiency in bulgarian you 'll hardly understand us . 
  people tend to look like terminators and if you see somebody smiling he 's : 1 . drunk 2 . with mental problems . 
  swearing and screaming for even the smallest things here is pretty normal . 
  we have tons of gypsies and if you are slightly more richer you can use them as cheap labor force or even as slaves ( eg you just bought 5t bricks/sand/cement / whatever but you 're too lazy to move them from point a ot b - no problems !, 
  for 20 leva our gypsies will move everything while you sit and watch them ( just do n't forget to feed them ) politics - we are kinda left leaning and there 's strong `` everything was better when zhivkov ruled bg '' sentiment . 
  also talking shit about russia ( does n't matter putinist/soviet/tsarist ) is n't well recieved . 
  its ok to be gay in the big cities not so much outside of them . 
  it is possible to get your ass kicked . 
  infrastructure and geography - roads are shit ( with a few exeptions ) trains are even shittier . 
  the region is mostly flat with only one mountain ( stara planina ) that separates us from the rest of bg . 
  * why did n't you invest in northwestern bulgaria ? 
  i expect well written replies and everybody to respect eachothers opinions ... not . 
  i 'm skeptical but good luck anyway . 
  well wikileaks is kinda big site if you ask me ... 
  i had to google what rugby is . 
  it looks like handegg to me, 
  it looks like you prefer working with more or less manipulated facts tho, 
  if you think our putin-loving ( really ? ), 
  bulgarians are 4 % then ok . 
  i really do n't believe in random polls on btv or manipulated elections . 
  you 're free to have your own opinion . 
  well if ` buying ' gypsies for 20lv . 
  and 5 kebabcheta is n't manipulation ... keep believing in that `` democracy thing '', 
  a family member who worked on the last elections told me its more than easy to manipulate the elections . 
  probably that 's why the vote turnout was 45 % and over 50 % did n't vote . 
  poll results are n't that hard to manipulate tho i can find a thousand people who like russia and my results will be 85 % pro-russian support , 15 % pro-us and in corrupt country like bulgaria i can show my `` poll results '' on tv . 
   most bulgarians want to be allies with the us i 'm not so sure about this . 
  and i thought / r/europe hates russia ... 
  i mean just look at this guy . 
  75 % of his articles are about `` russia '' or `` putin '', 
  you forgot give them some rafale planes for air protection, 
  [ thuringia is near the centre tho ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/ard_karte.svg ), 
  so much enemy at the gates bullshit . 
   have war with barbarians . 
  lose , there 's too many of them . 
   allow them into your country , your leadership , your military , promise them more money than you have , etc. 
   the fall of rome . 
  history repeats itself . 
  you can also [ find ] ( https://www.thegazette.co.uk/london/issue/85/page/1 ) the [ great fire of london ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_fire_of_london ), 
  i do n't know what 's going on but that was painful to watch .

  [ 10/10 the best summer ever .

  the border between bulgaria and turkey is already heavily defended on some places . 
  delete your gfx folder if you want to remove the black flags . 
  orthodox chistianity is the bestest religion,

  usa, 
  chalga for those who are wondering what chalga is [ planeta official youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/planetaofficial/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0&amp;sort=p ) basically shit music for gypsies and drunk people . 
  nothing new on / r/europe and reddit in general . 
   gratias elucidatione !, 
  wait is this latin ? 
  free shit tho if we are smashing bmws and audis i 'd also go there and search for some useful/not broken parts, 
  thanks but i do n't give a fuck about losing some virtual points lol,
