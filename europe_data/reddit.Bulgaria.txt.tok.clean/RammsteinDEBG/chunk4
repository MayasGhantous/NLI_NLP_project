  do you even history ? 
  yes you 're right , russia needed their `` own country '' in the balkans so they took us , but that was the case with all balkan countries not only bulgaria . 
  serbia was under austrian sphere , romania turkish , greece english . 
  bulgaro-serbian war was mostly fueled by austria , cause they felt like they are losing control over the balkans . 
  that 's why serbia attacked . 
  also battenberg was 20something so we ca n't talk about `` greatest ruler since the mediavial times '' 1908 ... yea we declared independence one day before austria annexed bosnia and herzegovina that 's why nobody really wanted to accept anything . 
  the russians were actually the ones who got the balkan league running . 
  the first balkan war ended after taking odrin from the turks . 
  again you should thank our `` bestest '' german tsars for the second balkan war . 
  that 's why its called war , not disneyland . 
  people who are opressed , jailed and got their party banned tend to do such things . 
  again i 've told you in my other comments why they attacked us . 
  yes killing our elite was bad thing i agree with that . 
  you are still crying about our 32 tons of gold . 
  kek . 
  maybe you should tell your merican/canadian partners to stop taking our gold too . 
  blocks were better looking but guess what happened - the glorious democracy came . 
  back in the 70s/80s we were world leaders in some agricultural sectors also we were the first country on the balkans to have nuclear plant , lukoil neftohim the biggest refinery was build in bulgas , kremikovtsi and many more . 
  some of them are still operational others sadly not . 
  our building and other materials were better than today 's , also our food and everything else was way better . 
  poverty and all that came from the massive privatisations/budget cuts/selling everything for scrap ... forgot our stealing politicians too . 
  ataka and bsp are joke parties in fact all parties are . 
  it was pleasure talking to you but sadly i have to go to bed cause its already 23.45 here . 
  good night . 
   there has n't been a country more consistently acting against bulgaria in the past 120 years than russia . 
  yea ... the uk totally did n't fuck us up back in 1878 with their berlin congress and again in 1919 . 
  ( also they did bomb the shit out of us during wwii ) but we are allies now , so i guess i should keep my mouth shut and talk shit about russia . 
   surrendering is kissing someone 's ass yes it is , but when you have massive war machine near your borders , its better to give them what they want ( see what denmark did in wwii )  hitler 's demands for soldiers to his fronts . 
  the tsar was n't so crazy after all . 
  even he knew that sending troops to russia is n't the bestest idea ( remember who freed us from the ottomans * cough * the evil russian people * cough * ) . 
   after bulgaria had broken all relations with hitler , expulsed the german troops from the country and sued for peace with the us and britain . 
  that was poor attempt to save the country . 
  `` hey guys we were allied with those evil germans for 3 years but now everything is 100 % normal and we are no longer friends with them . '', 
  kek . 
  what a fucking joke . 
  blame your german tsar and german loving pm for all this . 
  he had an opportunity to resist or surrender like the danish but instead he decided to kiss adolf hitler 's ass . 
   the place that invaded us in 1944 lets thank bogdan filov and our tsar boris iii for this . 
  [ deutschlandlied intensifies ], 
  with this they are saying `` look guys , we are the best . 
  does n't matter if its heathcare , democracy or music ( and shitty music ) - we are the best '' hail thor hail odin, 
  you can read how much ukrainians want to join the eu/nato almost everyday tho , theres always some shit posted about them here . 
  pro-russian or not , it is 100 % sure that ukraine is n't going to join the eu ( and probably nato ) for at least 10 more years . 
  fuck i 'm even surprised how nations like my homeland ( bg ) got in the eu/nato . 
  yep russian trucks ( atleast the ones build pre-90s ) are way more better . 
  if you have parts for them and do regular checks you can use them for 30 + years . 
  i like how this map gives georgia some territory and kaliningrad to lithuania . 
  ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ crimea ^ ^ ^ to ^ ^ ^ ukraine, 
  \\  comparing scandinavia and the balkans do n't . 
  \\  also thinking scandinavia is like the balkans do n't . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gah9nrgnhuu ) oh wait wrong year ... 
  i 'm just pointing out the hypocrites here . 
  `` what russia ( probably ) is doing in ukraine is bad , but what we did in iraq/afganistan was totally 100 % democratic thing '' and all that bullshit . 
  oh look who is talking . 
  the same who bombed the shit out of one country , cause they * thought * that country has nukes , but after they killed half of the fucking country they simply said `` uh sorry we did n't found any bombs '' . 
  lets not even talk about the `` war on terror '' which turned into vietnam 2.0 and now we got even more shit . 
  e : y' all should get your heads out of your asses sometimes . 
  good night . 
  # ** confirmed - pope francis is the new augustus !, 
  its not about how many bulgarians , greeks or turks are in the city or the glorious history - its all about the bosphorus . 
  if you control the city you got control over the black sea . 
  you decide who is going through and who is n't . 
  that 's why the russians wanted constantinopole so much . 
  i thought we 're fuckin poor with our rusty 100 t-72s , but damn having an army with 16 tanks only ... 
  i bet only generals drive them . 
  true , but remember that you have the power to change him from ` useless prick ' to ` progressive politican ' . 
  also you said you 're not tsarist fan , that 's your chance . 
  you can change the system and give more power to your people . 
  you do n't wan na be remembered as ` the guy who saved mother russia ', 
  also + join the allies in wwi . 
  now you have real chance to get constantinopole after the war , some land in anatolia and even parts of macedonia ( if the allies push serbia ), 
  good luck, 
  add ledenika , radetski and maybe 1-2 things more and these are literally the only good things here . 
  if you wan na waste your time then you 're free to visit us ( do n't cry if you get robbed ) .

  northwestern bulgaria . 
  the wild west just a little bit greener . 
  if you 're going thru just stick to the big cities and e79 . 
  and also remember that 's the poorest region in the eu so you def gon see some shit . 
  yea but in norway pack of cigarretes is something like 10 $ . 
  you want beer ? 
  that would be 10 $ too . 
  amazing, 
  go away erdogan, 
  i cringe so hard when i hear this, 
  historically speaking the ones who had full control of the balkans are the greeks ( ` romans ' ) , so i think they have more rights ^ ( ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ turks ^ ^ ^ too ^ ^ ^ but ^ ^ ^ fuck ^ ^ ^ them . 
  ^ ^ ^ orthodox ^ ^ ^ christianity ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ bestest ^ ^ ^ religion . ), 
  add saint petersburg to your version . 
  that 's gon na piss off so many russians . 
  i 'd send some troops on vacation to macedonia . 
   shopska salad derives its name from the region called shopluk . 
  it is a product of early socialism in bulgaria , the only survivor of five or six recipes , written in the late 1950s , whose aim was to impress the foreigners to visit the country . 
  at the time , leading chefs from balkanturist invented dobrujan , macedonian , thracian and several other salads with similar names , which were associated with different ethnographical regions . 
  but we 're in the eu remember ? 
  good luck winning . 
   thank you bulgaria & greece for helping with kicking the ottomans ass , ** thank you greece for helping with kicking the bulgarians ass ** . 
  thanks ... 
   shopska salad  serbia do you want another balkan war ? 
  if its something like switzerland yea why not, 
  he missed george and his sister .
