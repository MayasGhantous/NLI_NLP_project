  everytime when i watch turkish films i feel like i 'm watching old films from latin america . 
   what would happen ? 
  greeks will eventually assimilate most of you but there would be still turkish minority in anatolia . 
  something like how the kurds are minority in turkey today . 
   bulgarian culture got influenced by ottomans yea i know :d, 
   would we be the ones to assimilate into greeks minority - yes . 
  complete assimilation - no . 
  remember that some people survived 450 + years ottoman rule ( * cough * bulgaria ) and we did n't change our religion or culture . 
   if our religion was christianity god i want to see this . 
  and also greece and turkey united . 
  the german national anthem is the only thing i know ... and i 'm half german . 
  its a joke ... 
  howbout / r/russianempire ? 
  yep non-aligned movement . 
  lets create ` warsaw pact ' subreddit too . 
  both sides will write shit about them and who is better . 
  honestly i do n't give fuck if you 're pro-us or russian lover . 
  i was saying how biased and one-sided is the whole subreddit . 
  this is / r/europe the fuck would you expect . 
  if you say `` i do n't like usa '' you 'll be insta called ` commie ' and `` go kiss kim jungs ass '' this sub turned into massive pro-us circlejerk long time ago . 
  we can give the other countries parts of romania . 
  i mean when the gypsies are gone that land would be empty , so we can give them free land if they support me . 
  hre was traditionally elective monarchy, 
  we can split romania between bulgaria and hungary . 
  i 'll give a piece ( maybe the carpathians or bucharest ? ), 
  to your country too . 
  but you have to vote for me . 
  uh , well we have problems with all these gypsies in my country so ... 
  if you elect me as your new emperor you 'll have gypsy-free europe . 
  * turns on the gas * just kidding . 
  i added this to get more votes from the catholics . 
  i support this . 
  with my 1200 + hours i want to nominate myself as the new european emperor i am : + quick socializer charitable patient humble just holy warrior crusader - ugly clubfooted weak paranoid also forgot pneumonic but i 'm taking my medicine so that should go away in a week or 2 . 
  with risk of getting downvoted to hell i can say that most bulgarians who are over 40 will gladly go back to the 1980s if they had a chance . 
   princess elisabeth ( when 18 ) earning ~ 700 000 $ yearly and 8500 $ monthly heh communists did one good thing when they kicked our royals out .

  do n't be sad , you can join poland ... or hungary . 
  sadly i think we are not slavic enough , but if you change your mind we can anschluss again . 
  1014 never forget !, 
  * cough * let 's see ... military interventions since wwii : - us of a - 35 + - russia ( + su ) - 15-20 looks like to have a better `` freedom ' you have to kill half of the middle east and oust couple of democratically elected presidents . 
  but hey whatever , lets enjoy our macdonald 's burgers and ` freedom ' . 
  oh well ... maybe we can trade northwestern bulgaria for northern dobrudja ? 
  think about it . 
  you 'll receive one nuclear power plant and one brige over the danube + cheap labor force . 
  ofcourse you gon na lose most of your coast but we can pay you something . 
  `` but macedonians are the bestest slavs and we 're dirty turks '',
