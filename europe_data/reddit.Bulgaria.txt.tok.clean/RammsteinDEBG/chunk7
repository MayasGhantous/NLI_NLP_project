  i 'm sure if you run one referrendum right now in my country at least 65 % will be voting ` no ' ... our politicians are just asslicking retards that 's why we joined in 2004 ... but hey keep beliving that everybody wanted/wants to join nato . 
  i see the end of this farce soon anyway .

  he seriously did n't get a shit from what people are saying on the tv . 
  i think that 's just a dialect thing and because we are closer to serbia,
