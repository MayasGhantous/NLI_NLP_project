  ukraine is weak and in war with russia . 
  if poland rushes they can press some fabricated claims on western ukraine . 
  moldova is even weaker . 
  baltic region is split in three parts - easy victory there . 
  kaliningrad and belarus are the hard ones . 
  i think the best strategy here is to wait for the militarist tsar putin to die ( paradox pls nerf ) and when he dies poland needs to support `` little green men '' and annex those parts before somebody strong gets on the russian throne . 
  yea i got it my brain works a bit slower when it gets colder outside lol, 
  o i get it sorry ignore my first comment then i bet 5 levs on norway to win this, 
  ~ ~ nice pool but i think you should 've put ` poor ' ( in eu standards ) countries with other ` poor ' countries . ~ ~ ~ ~ putting austria and romania in the same group gives significant disadvantage to romania ~ ~ if you 're slow like me see the comments below, 
  \\  tfw you 're ugly slav and scandinavian goddesses do n't want to have sex with you i was born in the wrong country, 
  most ngos are cancer does n't matter western or eastern,

  yes \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d - \u0425\u0443\u0439\u043b\u043e means ` putin is a dick ' \u0425\u0443\u0439 means ` dick ' in most slavic languages, 
  his flair is \u041f\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d - \u0425\u0443\u0439\u043b\u043e if he truly is from russia i think its save to say he is one of the 20 or so % of russians who do n't like putin,
