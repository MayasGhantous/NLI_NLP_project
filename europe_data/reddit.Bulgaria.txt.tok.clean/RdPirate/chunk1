after the extraordinary meeting of the migrant crisis ended late last night in brussels , it became clear that the end of november will be established registration centers for refugees in countries along the external borders of the eu . 
  centers will surely have in greece and italy , and possibly in bulgaria . 
  there will register the newly arrived refugees will be taken and their fingerprints . 
  the big news after the european council last night came from speaking to the media of german chancellor angela merkel , who said that our country is ready to be one of the countries that will become the so-called . 
  `` hotspots '' . 
  countries which will become `` hot spots '' will be the first stop of refugees in europe , where they will receive their first registration . 
  ** according to angela merkel , such a `` hot spot '' will be in bulgaria ** `` we talked about italy and greece , but bulgaria also noted that shares a border with turkey and is under huge migratory pressures . 
  we approached with understanding and replied that if bulgaria is such a `` hot spot '' will receive the same support from the european institutions and agencies , as well as greece and italy . 
  we did not want to impose anything on bulgaria , but bulgaria herself said : `` we have a problem - and why we can not participate ? '', 
  said angela merkel . 
  ** prime minister boyko borisov refuted information ** immediately after his return from the european council borisov refuted the information that our country has requested the country to build `` hot spot '' . 
  `` bulgaria now is a hotspot . 
  and now we have built refugee camps . 
  why on earth would they sew togeter from everything that i said , that borisov wants to take them to make a refugee center , `` said boyko borisov . 
  the prime minister wanted our country to be considered a `` hot spot '' at the moment , given the fact that we are neighbors with turkey , which currently has about two million refugees . 
  `` given that the turkish prime minister warns me that he already iznemogva and that this refugee wave wells up outside of bulgaria , and i asked the rhetorical question '' do 100 000 or 200 000 refugees need to enter bulgaria and then we have to ask for an emergency council , `` explained the prime minister . 
  ** borisov wanted additional financial assistance to the country from europe ** `` i asked the question - greece and italy will receive financial aid , but what are we going to do ? 
  you vote for italy , greece money macedonia money for serbia but for it is bulgaria like we are not at the external borders , `` said borisov . 
  bulgaria keeps better its borders then greece , so the flow of refugees passes mainly through our southern neighbor , explained to the european council borisov . 
  the prime minister insisted more to build safety zones on the territory of syria , where they can be provided a safe place for life fleeing from war . 
  ** controversy in the national assembly ** some parties have strongly condemned opening a distribution center in the country , others said that such a thing would be good for bulgaria . 
  there were those who thought that there are actually a translation error and the our country will not build a similar center on its territory . 
  ** most lawmakers were surprised by the idea of a hot spot ** , and even claimed that they were not really sure what that means . 
  gerb announced that these distribution centers are outside of the eu . 
  `` that which i am aware , from the bulgarian side it was not asked bulgaria to become a hotspot and have a distribution center , '' said mep eva paunova . 
  the opposition was not very sure that such talks have not led . 
  `` once again bulgaria learns news about itself from brussels . 
  i can not say whether it is a hotspot or a reception center or hub , already confusing '' , said mp from bsp-left bulgaria atanas merdzhanov . 
  most parties recalled that last week rumyana bachvarova talked about six registration centers in the country . 
  `` there is no way for receptions centers to not be because we are members and we must obey the rules , '' said valeri simeonov , co-chairman of the patriotic front . 
  ** others were `` for '' centers in bulgaria ** `` the important thing is that bulgaria is active in solving the refugee crisis , these are good ideas . 
  it is good that merkel supports to hear the other , `` said atanas atanasov , a member of the reformist bloc . 
  ** some reacted very sharply ** `` i think that angela merkel does not lie . 
  because they buy sovereignty , those in brussels . 
  they offer 6,000 euros per head of a stranger , `` said magdalena tasheva . 
  according to some opposition establishment of such items at home will have tragic consequences for the country . 
  today part of the parties again demanded the convening of the advisory council on national security , to develop a common national position on the topic . 
  board meeting there was on april 27 , or five months . 
  ------- i tried fixing the google translation mixups and if anyone finds anymore please leave a comment so that i can fix it . 
  iirc there are some refugee camps close to the turkey border and after they are processed they get released from them ... to live where they can, 
  from tents in turkey to tents in bulgaria in the winter ... 
  i care because i can imagine what merkel will say when she finds out how her favorite toys are getting treated . 
  why are we taking any refugees considering we are a border country and we are poor as fuck?what are we supposed to feed them ? 
  is someone keeping track in who is sane in the eu ? 
  because i think we may need to make our own ( sane ) union if this one continues as it is . 
  no ... atleast not in the circles i am at, 
  ... can you see the cracks in reality as well ? ... 
  the us wants assad dead the russians want him alive for now and until one of them backs down or loses the war will not end ... 
  can we just go back to the san stefano threaty ... [ ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/bulgaria-sanstefano_-%281878%29-bytodorbozhinov.png ), 
  i think that by the end of the current migrant crisis and the economic ones the donau river on the romania-bulgaria part will be covered by 1 massive bridge made from the conetion of a number of smaller ones that will go from end to end of the border ... 
  guest a : eu are nazies and are evil devils !!!!!, 
  guest b : the decisions made in the past were poor , but we must still remember why the civil wars happen after the dictators fell.also germany may have some problems assimilating all the refugees . 
  considering that iirc the gypsys got kicked out of india im not suprized . 
  i 'd like one for bulgaria just so that i can see all the `` pants on fire '' meaters going nuts ... 
  or us for that matter ? 
  question : where in the hell is bulgaria in these ? 
  yes it does by making facial identification on sight impossible and to add to the fact that it has a history of being used by actual terrorists as a cover . 
  the origin of bulgars is unknown with theories ranging from west siberian to parts of the nomadic tribes attacking china ( as evidanced by the bulgar and chinese calander being extremely similar ) to being from northern iran ( witch iirc is what is being taught in iran ) . 
  so please do not open the can of worms that is the bulgar origins . 
  probably b/c some people see us involvement and as of recently increased military presence in eeu as a provocation to russia which brings in the fear of the us doing something that can cause a war in which we will be a victims of.as such it is seen that the us is a biger threat due to what their actions can cause . 
  bulgarian prime minister boyko borisov has dismissed warnings from the us department of state about a possible attack in the capital sofia . 
  `` the information ... does not match reality , '' he has made clear , adding there is no danger to either `` residents or guests of sofia . '', 
  domestic security agency dans and the interior ministry have already checked the warning submitted to 112 , the emergency hotline , borisov has explained in a statement that follows a message by the us state department citing the country 's embassy in sofia . 
  `` the checkup found out it was all about unsettled love relations between a bulgarian and a foreign national , '' he has added . 
  borisov has also slammed us diplomats for exporting to the public `` the information received by their bulgarian counterparts '' and for doing so in an `` absolutely unacceptable way '' . 
  the us state department 's message came separately from a travel alert issued on tuesday in the aftermath of the deadly attacks in brussels claimed by the islamic state ( is ) group . 
  the warning about bulgaria was published on the facebook timeline of the department 's consular section late on wednesday bulgarian time ( eet ) . 
  no follow-up comments have been published as of 11:00 on thursday . 
  commenting on the developments earlier on thursday , the interior ministry 's chief secretary georgi kostov said society had growing `` more sensitive '' to any possible threats after the brussels attacks and that was the explanation for an increased number of warnings submitted by authorities . 
  most of said places are deserts and jungles ... have fun routing cables and maintaining a viable network . 
  edit : also warzones should not forget that warzones as well ... 
  yes but there are places on the planet that do not see much sun and unless you have the design for a room temperature super conductor those places wo n't be able to use solar . 
  but when the prices rise no new people can buy and rent out their other apartment/house . 
  if you sell it then yes you will lose cash if you decide to rent it then probably not . 
   bulgaria still has the laws and the attitude to use lethal force for border control . 
  do not also forget that our government amended the law and made it legal for the * army * to guard the borders agen ... 
  i have no idea how it can be represented as the greek remains considering that the capital is constantinople ( istanbul ) . 
  also they fought the bulgarians quite a bit . 
  ... considering how much byzantine is in my country 's history i 'm quite surprised that the west only learns it fell at around the end of the middle ages ... 
  me existed before islam and was mostly controlled by christians and was quite advanced also you worded what you said in a way that read that me prospered only after islam . 
  no it is the east roman empire witch continued to exist after the fall of the west roman empire ( the roman empire was spit into 2 parts ) . 
  [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/byzantine_empire ), 
  so the most technologically advanced empire around those time and in the region going by the name `` byzantine '' ( christian ) did not exist ? 
  the bulgarian parliament extended on thursday the powers of the army , allowing it to guard the state borders . 
  the amendment to the defence and armed forces act was unanimously approved at second reading with 137 mps voting in favour , daily dnevnik informs . 
  until now , the armed forces could only provide assistance , such as logistics , to the officials of the interior ministry . 
  now the army has the power to guard the border on an equal footing with border policemen . 
  the army will be deployed only in extraordinary and crisis situations . 
  the servicemen also have to prepare tactical plans for reaction in the event of heightened migrant pressure . 
  the council of ministers will entrust the army with concrete tasks and will provide the necessary funding for their implementation , while the defence minister will regulate the use of force against intruders . 
  on wednesday , the bulgarian government approved the allocation of up to bgn 35 m on the construction of the fence along the border with turkey . 
  atleast when we do corruption we go big ... 
  it was temporarily and sorta out of nowhere ( my headcanon is that they ran out of booze ) . 
  di n't tesla want to ( or has ) open sourced some of the tech ? 
  our truck drivers are already planning to ... 
  soo maximum denomination to be of 20s ? 
  it seems hourly because most crimes get reported due to the fact that they get better ratings compared to the crimes committed by other people ... as induced by the media going for more `` clicks '' than reporting on things without having to twist/ignore them in the quest for said `` cliks '' ... 
  di n't you hear !, 
  boiko has been praying and sacrificing political dissidents ussr style to tangra and has it all covered ... / s, 
  no i am still reading up on what is actually happening in france .
