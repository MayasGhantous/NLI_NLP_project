  just this year 800milion people were born into less than 2 dollars per day lives and they are considered by the un to be dangerously poor.unless the `` rich '' countries take 800milion people a year any relocation we do is going to be pointles considering that said people that are going to be taken in ( outside of medical and other reasons like war ) are the people whit education that are most needed in said countries in order to improve the conditions there.any help that we from said `` rich '' countries must help the people that are living there already and not just move them about because unless we help the countries themselves all we are doing is saying `` we tried '' . 
  it due to play on words and and the fact it sounds similar as other words that are insults isis does not like it even one bit ( they cut the thongs of those who call them that ),

   simeon i , following a makeshift imperial coronation performed by the patriarch of constantinople in 913 . 
  after an attempt by the byzantine empire to revoke this major diplomatic concession and a decade of intensive warfare , the imperial title of the bulgarian ruler was recognized by the byzantine government in 924 and again at the formal conclusion of peace in 927 . 
  since in byzantine political theory there was place for only two emperors , eastern and western ( as in the late roman empire ) , the bulgarian ruler was crowned basileus as `` a spiritual son '' of the byzantian basileus . 
  [ 5 ] you 're right . 
  true and as far as i remember the bulgarian title was given to us from one of the ere emperors . 
  the title of tzar comes from the title caesar and the only 2 countries that can call their rulers ( due to historical reasons ) tzars are bulgaria and ** russia ** witch is why russia can claim to be ere, 
  is it good or is it bad that bulgaria got forgotten even by terrorists ? 
  in bulgaria we use the lev ... also supposed to mean ( in archaic bulgarian ) lion ...

  ( look at it as a big military drill about troop transportation in case of war with russia ), 
   bulgaria ** n ** capital fixed it for you, 
  do remember that serbia , bulgaria and romania agreed to close their borders as well if the path to germany gets closed so that they dont become `` buffer states '', 
  to russia anything not assad supporting in syria = terrorists and if some of said targets were helped ( read : had money thrown at them ) by the cia then all it means is that they will drop an extra bomb on em and celebrate whit vodka extra hard after they land ... 
  bulgaria and greece once went to war because a greek border guards dog crossed the border and ~ ~ got shot ~ ~ the guard got shot chasing it ... edit : facts ...

  vladislav goranov , minister of finance : i have tried my best to implement these reforms . 
  for one reason or another , we were unable to achieve it ... 
  in the end i since march 2015 alarmed that the rate at which these changes are made , are not satisfactory , but i took and commitment that we can not leave because they have no fault line staff across systems without pay . 
  in november and december due to the reason that the political leaderships of various ministries were unable did not want or do not have enough time to do one or another reform direction optimization .
