  step one : blame the us step two : blame anyone leveling criticism as a islamophobe step tree : treten the eu whit more refugees/blame the eu for their support for the same factions you are supporting step four : ??? 
  step five : profit !!, 
  2something million refugees ... 
  wikileaks has released some parts of the documents . 
  ( iirc ) iron curtain : ** anyone ** that tries to ** enter ** or exit is ** shot on sight ** or is killed by the minefields ... 
  literary the same in bulgaria ... 
  quite honestly i have no idea anymore . 
  we must free ourselves from the fears relating to refugees . 
  about this opinion united representatives of various religious communities in the country in `` this saturday '' on btv . 
  the position of the bulgarian orthodox church on refugees certainly ruffled some feathers in the week . 
  the events provoked us to look for representatives of the largest religious communities in the country to hear their messages on the issue of refugee crisis and what do the `` field '' . 
  `` there must be a reason and it must be sober , you should not succumb so the emotions and fears , '' said dobromir dimitrov - turnovo orthodox priest in church `` st. mina '' and assistant professor at the university of veliko tarnovo . 
  `` the statement of the orthodox church was prompted by a concern to this nation . 
  unfortunately , this message was interpreted very differently . 
  maybe i should be more precise and refugees instead to use the word migrants , refugees fleeing because of fear of annihilation , they can not give up and they should be stopped , `` he explained . 
  in his words , the state should distinguish who is a refugee and who is an economic migrant and a different attitude . 
  `` of course , we as christians are obliged to accept the other , '' he said . 
  according to him , the big challenge is to the selfishness of man . 
  people are very conservative creatures , we are xenophobes , hate the other man in his ego is the biggest problem hardly allow another person , said father dobromir . 
  according to the protestant pastor theodore oprenov history gives us a chance to manifest our humanity and statistics on refugees should not instill fear of the foreign . 
  `` give them the opportunity to be trained to learn the bulgarian language . 
  they do not want to stand on the street to beg or to wash car windows . 
  give them a chance and they will find a way to be integrated and contribute to the best of which are capable of , `` he said . 
  former regional mufti of sofia , smolyan hajredin ali said that experiencing a crisis with himself , with his own identity as a people . 
  `` in bulgaria little more burdened by the past - here 's ottoman rule , here come the islamists . 
  neither one nor the other is tied to any real logic , `` he said and gave the example of christian communities in muslim countries for centuries not being islamised . 
  `` that '' islamic state `` has asked that have nothing to do with religion , does not mean that the position of muslims '' was categorical hajredin . 
  according to him missing intimately contact , communication between the communities . 
  we can not reach people , to their hearts . 
  you have little to open , these fears to release them from us , he said . 
  `` globally , there is a wave of islamophobia - muslims come will islamize turkish slavery will be repeated . 
  these are political maneuvers that put us in a vicious circle , `` is his opinion . 
  in his words , any message that is sent regardless of which religious community if it is not based on justice and virtue , can not be god 's message . 
  bogdan patashev , theologian of the catholic church - bulgaria , recalled the pope 's call to overcome their fears . 
  pope says that refugees and migrants challenge us , the answer is in the gospel of charity , he said . 
  `` the call is to disagree with fears and be ready to welcome the stranger , the other , '' said patashev . 
  `` fears will prove ephemeral and insignificant . 
  in the meeting , both sides are enriched , `` said he . 
  prety much , 
  on the picture there is no english text that explains that this was a for illegal parking , so yes they did forget . 
  ( or it is on the other side ), 
   it 's also nice that they translated it in several languages except they forgot english ... 
  he parked in the wrong place and had a clamp ( ? ), 
  placed on his wheel and now has to pay a fine to have it removed .

  just read wikipedia ... turns out most kurds that practice islam are sunni or shia ... 
  then lets hope whatever the refugees follow is not calling sunni to be killed because they follow the wrong brand of islam ... 
   75 % of syrians citiziens are kurds if i am not mistaken are not most of our muslums sunni whit the the other ( smaller ) part being shi'a ? ... 
   well , this is very individual in my opinion . 
  i know a syrian girl who fled the war and came to sofia a couple of years ago , she 's already going to university , working two part-time jobs and is getting better and better with her bulgarian by the day . 
  if even 40 % of the refugees were doing ( or planing on doing themselves or their children of doing ) what she is i am certan that most of the problems that exist whit refugees will either be alot less and/or not as strong if existant at all . 
   however , i doubt that most of the people from the middle east would integrate so easily and quickly . 
  and yes , the eu should not receive economic immigrants and these should be deported . 
  true i doubt that they will integrate fully that fast , but when i say integrate i usually mean to the point where they know the language have a stable job go to normal school and have started incorporating the host culture into their own ( and even the host culture adopting some things from theirs ) . and it is hard to find out who is who when the economic immigrants are dumping all of their legitimate identification and buying illegal syrian ones . 
  in order for a person to receive reparations they need to have their dna decoded and genetic markers compared to the slavic ones . 
  ( fine print : all dna and related information will be saved in the name of science in the highest security shelves . 
  ( even finer print : any genetic material that is given is now property of non-evil-corp inc. ) ), 
  i want repayment from the descendants of the khazars for the destruction of old great bulgaria !!!, 
  consider that the original word for slave was thrall and that due to the number of slav people being enslaved the word slav became a sinonim for slave and later it transformed into the word slave that replaced thrall . 
  those that want to stay and try to integrate are welcome and will probably integrate mostly in 2 ~ 4 generations but those that expect us to treat them like children and feed , clothe and place a roof over their head and expect that we treat them good even when they say things like this are more then welcome to leave and go back home ( those from not from war torn countries ) or go to one of the countries that will welcome them even when they bite the hand that literary feeds them . 
  not only that but even the people that say that believe in god are basically only traditional christians and pray or go to church rarely or on official holidays if at all . 
   hundreds of millions a billion or two ... just look at africa and the population growth predictions ... 
  what needs to happen is that there needs to be plan on how to retrofit pre existing houses with it and be as un intrusive to the houses as possible.also a plan under which a person can stop and charge using any random house around while not causing the person to whom the house belongs to to pay higher electricity price . 
  and the comment is me posting the text in the article ... 
  bulgaria 's defense minister said on sunday there had been a rise in violations of its airspace by russian military and commercial aircraft in the past month , calling the alleged breaches a `` provocations toward bulgaria and its air forces '' . 
  nikolay nenchev told bulgarian television channel nova tv that russian military aircraft had entered what he termed `` bulgaria 's area of responsibility '' in nato airspace four times in the past month . 
  he said the planes had turned off their transponders -- communications devices that , alongside normal radars , make it easier for an airplane to be located , especially in congested air space . 
  `` it is very worrying , so we take preventive measures , '' nenchev said . 
  any unauthorized entry of an aircraft required the scrambling of bulgarian fighter jets , he added . 
  russian passenger planes breached the airspace six times in the past month , he said . 
  bulgaria had demanded an explanation from moscow over the violations , nenchev said , describing the incidents as `` provocations toward bulgaria and its air forces '' . 
  the russian defence ministry was not immediately able to comment when contacted by reuters . 
  in january , nato secretary general jens stoltenberg urged russia to `` take all necessary measures '' to ensure nato airspace was not violated . 
  his comments came after turkey shot down in november a russian warplane flying a sortie over syria that it said had violated its airspace , triggering a diplomatic rupture in which russia imposed economic sanctions . 
  last september , bulgaria denied russian aid flights bound for syria entry to its airspace , citing it had serious doubts about the cargo onboard . 
  bulgaria , a former communist state and once staunch ally of moscow , is almost entirely dependent on russian energy supplies , and many bulgarians feel a deep affinity for their giant neighbor across the black sea .

  lets say if you want to know what it is there is a subredit by a similar name but i am not linking that place ... 
  40 + % of the dna matirial of bulgarians is from the thracians ...
