it is actually spelled : \u0417\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e = \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0434 . 
  sure , there were n't thousands of grenades thrown around . 
  but still , many problems arise from immigration . 
  i believe that being pragmatic about something should not make you a bad person . 
  to give an example - if i own an online company and i see a lot of fraudulent transactions from ukraine , i may as well ban the whole country - good customers along the bad ones . 
  you make choices in life which are far away from idealistic . 
  in my utopian future world everybody lives happy together , we all have abandoned religion , speak one language english and work together towards exploring the galaxy . 
  but then i remember that we 're not there yet and try to accept reality . 
  like if somebody shouts allahu akbar in a metro , i will not think they were happy about something , i will run thinking there are terrorists . 
  and you would probably do the same thing . 
  please watch this and tell me what you think : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9up0cllpppo problems like self-segregation ( choosing to live in the `` arab '' area of town ) and white flight are making it so that you have a country within a country . 
  like it or not , people can locally change a place . 
  you may individually not like what they are doing , but when they have the numbers against you , then your opposition of non-european values will mean nothing . 
  also , is n't it true that your immigrants are causing a lot of crime issues ? 
  are these grenades thrown by swedes ?

  [ oh my god it is the worst ] ( https://www.google.bg/maps/@42.669021,23.267344,3a,75y,227.99h,80.01t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1slytl4vkwfywi8bpwwoecfa!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  they say those things in cities without a large muslim community . 
  say the same about mexicans please and start picking fights with them . 
  it 's been a subject in the news lately . 
  i think that the situation in ukraine/russia and the middle east ( isis ) helps the generals + minister cause of asking for more money . 
  our military budget is almost non-existent at the moment at 2 percent of gdp - at around 1.190 billion . 
  we need to spend some cash soon on new jet fighters . 
  the whole last floor was one giant `` apartment '' . 
  it 's not your typical property for sure . 
  here 're some examples : http://www.imot.bg/pcgi/imot.cgi?act=5&amp;adv=1e142547284267950&amp;slink=1u7rtr&amp;f1=1 http://www.imot.bg/pcgi/imot.cgi?act=5&amp;adv=1e143057891516715&amp;slink=1u7rtr&amp;f1=1, 
  i have known several taxi drivers who are roma and earn a good living . 
  many also work as fruit & veggies sellers on corners and outdoor shops . 
  some have integrated and work other jobs . 
  i have a colleague gypsy who knows pretty good german and works in a call center . 
  she 's pretty normal and nobody is giving her any trouble . 
  guess it helps she 's hot too , but yeah there are examples of them integrating . 
  i have walked on this street so many times it 's so familiar . 
  the last floor on the building shown in the picture is where i had one of the craziest new year 's parties ever . 
  private 500m apartment with its own big terrace and stairs to the roof where we watched the fireworks . 
  it was pretty awesome . 
  being poor in the poorest country in the eu sucks . 
  having money in it makes for some fine living actually . 
  yeah , you really do n't get the point , do you ? 
  often in history and even today some people are called or nickname as being `` from somewhere '' . 
  count robert von amsterdam for example . 
  does not make him any less dutch , just because it is not mentioned in the name . 
  also the guy you mention lived in byzantine theme or district of macedonia ( an administrative division corresponding to the area of adrianople in thrace ) . 
  on his ancenstry - claims have been made for an armenian , [ 1 ] slavic , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] or indeed `` armeno-slavonic '' [ 2 ] origin for basil i. 
  like people from a certain region are called `` macedonian '' , because it 's macedonia as in this is who we call the region . 
  a guy from bavaria would be bavarian , this does not make it a country . 
  i mean it is not rocket science , you can just read it here : `` medieval and ottoman period main article : south slavs further information : bulgaria ( theme ) and ottoman vardar macedonia slavic peoples settled in the balkan region including macedonia by the late 6th century . 
  during the 580s , byzantine literature attests to the slavs raiding byzantine territories in the region of macedonia , later aided by bulgars . 
  historical records document that in c. 680 a group of bulgars , slavs and byzantines led by a bulgar called kuber settled in the region of keramisian plain , centred on the city of bitola . 
  [ 34 ] presian 's reign apparently coincides with the extension of bulgarian control over the slavic tribes in and around macedonia . 
  the slavic peoples that settled in the region of macedonia accepted christianity as their own religion around the 9th century , during the reign of tsar boris i of bulgaria . 
  in 1014 , the byzantine emperor basil ii defeated the armies of tsar samuil of bulgaria , and within four years the byzantines restored control over the balkans ( including macedonia ) for the first time since the 7th century . 
  however , by the late 12th century , byzantine decline saw the region contested by various political entities , including a brief norman occupation in the 1080s . 
  in the early 13th century , a revived bulgarian empire gained control of the region . 
  plagued by political difficulties , the empire did not last , and the region came once again under byzantine control in the early 14th century . 
  in the 14th century , it became part of the serbian empire , who saw themselves as liberators of their slavic kin from byzantine despotism . 
  skopje became the capital of tsar stefan dusan 's empire . 
  following dusan 's death , a weak successor appeared , and power struggles between nobles divided the balkans once again . 
  these events coincided with the entry of the ottoman turks into europe . 
  the kingdom of prilep was one of the short-lived states that emerged from the collapse of the serbian empire in the 14th century . 
  [ 35 ] gradually , all the central balkans were conquered by the ottoman empire and remained under its domination for five centuries . '', 
  you deny your heritage as much as you want but our language and common history shows us to be the same people . 
  it does not diminish anything that you have done as a region before that and who knows maybe your ancestors were macedonians , but for the most parts we 're slavs who mixed up a little with the bulgars . 
  why would we declare war ? 
  we were preparing for a with turkey . 
  `` lured by austria-hungary 's promises for territorial gains from bulgaria ( in return for concessions in the western balkans ) , milan i declared war on bulgaria on 14 november [ o.s. 
  2 november ] 1885 '', 
  yeah sure , it 's a family name which you might find in canada too . 
  but see the percents and how widespread the name is here compared to the other places . 
  there is no such language as macedonian mate , you were either part of greece or bulgaria , there are no records of vassals or anything like that throughout the ages . 
  i mean you say you have some evidence but it is highly doubtful on what is present in the real world already . 
  we should have been friends ... that first serbo-bulgarian war should have never happened : `` the main bulgarian advantage was the strong patriotic spirit and morale , as well as the feeling among the men that they were fighting for a just cause . 
  the same could not be said about the serbs . 
  their king had misled them in his manifest to the army , telling the serbian soldiers that they were being sent to help the bulgarians in their war against turkey . 
  this was why the serbian soldiers were initially surprised to find that they were fighting bulgarians instead , until they understood what was happening . 
  presumably , lying to his army was king milan 's only means to mobilize and command his troops without experiencing disobedience and unrest . '', 
  imagine if your king was not such a dick what we could have done . 
  fighting between each other is stupid, 
  some lies are very easy to reveal as such , once you do some reading . 
  as i commented beforehand - a dialect does not change your nationality . 
  being from a certain region does not change who you are . 
  it 's sad that people revolted in the 1903s to try and liberate macedonia so that it joins bulgaria and 112 years later it is forgotten . 
  propaganda is one hell of a tool . 
  here is what a foreign journalist wrote : `` the british journalist of the balkans h. n. brailsford wrote in his book `` macedonia : its races and their future '' : the moment for which the bulgarian population had been preparing for ten years , arrived on the festival of the prophet elijah 's day -- the evening of sunday , august the 2nd , 1903 . '', 
  http://lastnames.myheritage.com/last-name/%d0%a8%d0%be%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%b2?lang=bg mate do n't try that on me . 
  my name is \u0428\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432 and i 'm 100 % bulgarian . 
  a regional dialect does not change your nationality . 
  i do comment in youtube  one of my highest rated comments is about how stupid hate is and to be kinder to each other . 
  it was on a football video where some romanians and bulgarians had risen to the challenge of insulting each other and their respective mothers . 
  btw i plan on visiting ohrid this year , i heard it is lovely . 
  hey little brothers , good luck in your fight !, 
  we kind of succeeded in throwing off our last government and forcing re-elections . 
  the sucky part is that the corruption did not end and things are still in need of improvement . 
  bulgarian here . 
  if you have conservative relatives it may not be your choice . 
  the pressure from family , friends or even people in the neighborhood may have some women conceal their faces . 
  i think it is a good thing for us to support this kind of ban . 
  speak for yourself and do not judge entire communities based on the bad apples you have encountered . 
  i have never had problems with bulgarian muslims or people with turkish descent . 
  at least we have a major party representing them in politics , some western democracies full of emigrants have a low proportion of people representing minorities in politics compared to their percent in the general population .
