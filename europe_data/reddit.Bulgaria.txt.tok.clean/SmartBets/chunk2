  forgive me for being blunt - but why would it be illegal ? 
  is there some great good that comes from doing business with an offshore business ? 
  surely if the whole of the eu exerts pressure on them they will lose a lot of their significance . 
  i might be missing something , and most things in life are nuanced . 
  i can not think of many reasons as to why for example we should not disrupt banking for the caymans . 
  banks should be closed . 
  no `` too big to fail '' or fine shit . 
  closures of banks and criminal prosecutions for top officials/auditors of said banks . 
  also , offshore countries who do such things should be removed from swift/banking system . 
  i have not read into this but i think it is high time we demand action on these issues . 
  i started a petion here https://petiport.secure.europarl.europa.eu/petitions/en/main but it seems it takes forever . 
  once done i will post it in / r/europe if mods allow this . 
  i did not know we were enabling tax evasion . 
  or did you mean because our taxes are so low ? 
  is there something that prevents us from imposing sanctions on such territories/countries ? 
  remove them from swift , prevent transfer of capital/make it illegal for companies registered there to operate . 
  remove them from the internet network . 
  non-military `` fuck you `` s - stuff like that . 
  i felt like my goverment/the eu does not do enough to prevent tax avoidance . 
  i pay my taxes , the big guys should pay them too . 
  for every tax euro not spent our hospitals get underfunded , our schools etc. 
  with hospitals it directly involves loss of human life . 
  it 's not just money or a laughing matter . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfwmfevhdqo georgia in america is famous for their peaches i think . 
  yes , it is a disease on the society built by citizens here and now . 
  i paid taxes for many years and so did my father to build the roads , houses etc here . 
  we do have more right to it than immigrants . 
  i am not welcoming immigration . 
  there are lots of muslim countries in the middle east . 
  let them stay there . 
  only reason these guys come to western europe are the benefits/good economy . 
  if bulgaria had a better economy/benefits or equally as good as sweden , we would see an influx of foreigners . 
  they do not go there because of the nice weather or food . 
  this was discussed in a university class . 
  seems that switzerland can ban building of new mosques because of their past not being tainted and germany on the other hand would not do much to interfere . 
  sweden also suffers from some tainted past and is trying to overcompensate . 
  smart people in charge of policies who know history and sins of their grandfathers will shift the blame and responsibility on the future generations . 
  the site is bulgarian . 
  the cyrilic was indeed invented during the first bulgarian empire however , thank you . 
  one of our vice ministers has been quoted on this otherwise . 
  no sense arguing with people like that . 
  i know most people live boring lives which are not filled with violence , but it is also true that many face harassment , threats and worse . 
  these terrorist attacks in france which were targeting jewish schools/buildings did not occur by incident . 
  or the killing of jewish tourists in bulgaria like 3 years ago . 
  i am not sure why some people keep on pretending that there is no issue . 
  we might have fought a lot , but also fought lot in the face of a common enemy  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tervel_of_bulgaria#the_war_with_the_arabs_in_717.e2.80.93718_and_later_life generally , i consider all of our neighbors as great dudes . 
  i love the food we have in the balkans , our traditions , music folklore , history and so on . 
  historically we have wronged each other , nobody is the wiser at the end if we continue to fight however . 
  co-operation is the key and the only lesson we should take . 
  we should have never fought between each other and continued economic development during the 20th century . 
  imagine what all of our countries would look like if millions have not died in meaningless wars . 
  i may have overreacted but i watched this national geographic documentary recently about typhoons and natural disasters of other kinds . 
  shit 's real yo and not a joke . 
  rain and clouds most of the time is bad weather true , but you can not compare this to typhoons man . 
  these tropical storms fuck shit up . 
  the uk is too densely populated for them not to hit something each time one passes through . 
  enjoy your typhoons , 
  why not ? 
  what 's so great about the uk anyway ? 
  you got to buy a 2nd hand car ? 
  good luck buying a property now . 
  this video made me think french nutella hs less cocoa then german nutella : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxp2mtwnoz4 so i think it may be not just central/eastern europe suffering . 
  is n't it very difficult however ? 
  but there was a village named yantra and some other bulgarian names in the game . 
  edit : also glagolic was used in bulgaria for a while too . 
  until we invented the glorious cyrillic alphabet . 
  which by the way is the best alphabet for the languages in the region . 
  i can not understand why serbs started using latin alphabet . 
  yes this is the correct one -- https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5aix5i/contemporary_scottish_ballet_amazing_short_movie/ https://youtu.be/fxsjupjssqw, 
  yes i linked to a playlist - this is correct one -- https://youtu.be/fxsjupjssqw new thread -- https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5aix5i/contemporary_scottish_ballet_amazing_short_movie/, 
  i am no expert but the video said ballet dancers . 
  i titled it contemporary since i know it 's not very traditional . 
  the dance is actually quite intriguing , it 's as if you 're watching the dance of two people who want to become more intimate but are scared at first . 
  bulgarians i would assume . 
  i think part of the issue is that cnn/bbc/other western media do not criticize us army actions in the same manner they do that when it comes to russia . 
  hospitals were burned in us airstrikes and i have not seen an outrage in media/society about that . 
  it 's an `` unfortunate mistake '' . 
  it 's the same way media reports on vandalism of whites vs vandalism of blacks . 
  there 's a bias in the language and the way reporting is done . 
  until that 's gone , the reminders `` but america ... '' are not redundant . 
  i am looking forward to this agreement coming into place  any canadian who is into the wine business and wants to import some bulgarian wine - message me . 
  on a larger scale you may feel disconnected from everything , but imagine you 're in a small village . 
  and you all do something that 's important for the village . 
  and it 's a nice village so you 're proud of it . 
  you may be a simple baker and never have built any of the roads or houses but you 're still contributing and working there . 
  on a grander scale you do the same when you 're a citizen of a country . 
  your taxes go to preserving national monuments , maintaining schools , galleries etc. 
  and maybe what you do itself also contributes to the whole . 
  at the end of the day why not feel proud and celebrate ? 
  what are national holidays for otherwise ? 
  because this is where you receive your education and this is where you also lived ? 
  i would understand if you did not live there , but you are in a way contributing by living and being raised there . 
  yet statistically most people have not heard of let 's say bulgarian music , can not find it on the map and do not know of any bulgarian authors etc. 
  so in a way britain historically has done a lot more . 
  i am also proud of my culture and i am happy we spread the cyrillic alphabet for example among a few other things ( like helping constantinopole in 8th century against an arab invasion ) . 
  he is right about some things , wrong about others . 
  you bring valid points but so does he . 
  nothing wrong with being proud of your country 's history . 
  some til about another great victory often forgotten : `` the byzantine-bulgarian victory of 718 and the victory of the frankish king charles martel in the battle of tours ( 732 ) stopped the muslim advance in the interior of europe . '', 
  land in romania and bulgaria is quite cheap .
