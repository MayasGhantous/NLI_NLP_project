  we will see what is done in terms of reforms and managing the country . 
  could be the brits outsmart the rest of europe somehow . 
  i am luffy , future king of pirates , looking for the one piece treasure . 
  recently a turkish minister urged bulgarian muslim citizens to vote for a particular party . 
  to do that against the laws of your countries while holding such a high post speaks immensely . 
  moreso , a foreign ambassador ( turkish again ) was campaigning in favor for the same party . 
  parties based on ethnicity or faith are forbidden in bulgaria . 
  turkey has gone down a slippery slope few years ago and now is sliding towards a clash that inevitably will come . 
  it will be a clash with values of democracy and hopefully its own citizens will rise again in protests . 
  this is easily the best subreddit . 
  i think i spend more time here per thread reading comments than any other subreddit . 
  rarely i contribute as much since more can be desired from my english but i am happy to be a small part of the community . 
  both of you are kind of wrong . 
  if you look at what 's been happening with the kurdish population , there has been a civil war for a long time . 
  just one side is losing real badly . 
  after isis is gone we will see what happens in that region , but i doubt the kurds will let things stay the same . 
  i am alone , a silent warrior in a fantasy world . 
  slave also derives from slav , no ? 
  christ , dost thou live indeed ? 
  or are thy bones still straitened in their rock-hewn sepulchre ? 
  and was thy rising only dreamed by her whose love of thee for all her sin atones ? 
  for here the air is horrid with men 's groans , the priests who call upon thy name are slain , dost thou not hear the bitter wail of pain from those whose children lie upon the stones ? 
  come down , o son of god !, 
  incestuous gloom curtains the land , and through the starless night over thy cross a crescent moon i see !, 
  if thou in very truth didst burst the tomb come down , o son of man !, 
  and show thy might lest mahomet be crowned instead of thee !, 
  how dare you bother me at work ? 
  do n't you see i am trying to chill at the reception on my phone ? 
  i always laugh at the term expat used to describe uk/us immigrants . 
  the word immigrant seems to be too dirty for most of them so they use expat instead . 
  is it just me who came to this conclusion ? 
  moldova 's demographic crisis may worsen if it is accepted in the eu . 
  it 's a very weird example of a country dying . 
  i 'm afraid several more countries in eastern europe are going the same way . 
  so perhaps indeed - a belarus approach may work better for them . 
  i am not an expert but here 's what wikipedia says : `` bulgarian , along with the closely related macedonian language ( collectively forming the eastern group of south slavic ) , has several characteristics that set it apart from all other slavic languages : [ 1 ] [ 2 ] changes include the elimination of case declension , the development of a suffixed definite article ( see balkan language area ) , and the lack of a verb infinitive , but it retains and has further developed the proto-slavic verb system . 
  various evidential verb forms exist to express unwitnessed , retold , and doubtful action . '', 
  i remember my grandmother telling me we used to have cases similar to russian ones in the past , but do n't quote me on that . 
  i am biased of course , but when i hear or read any other slavic language i am like `` i think bulgarian might be easier '' . 
  the slavic languages that use latin alphabet really irks me too , some of these characters are not just foreign but look hard to write . 
  i know that kotor is beautiful and there was a really nice nightclub my friend showed me . 
  i think it was somewhere in budva ? 
  i want to go there this summer as a tourist to see it for myself . 
  would appreciate recommendations as to where to stay exactly ( hotel , city , what to do , where to eat etc ) . 
  it 's a well known fact in bulgaria what happened to turks also since as recently in the 80s the communists sent over a lot of turks to turkey . 
  if we talk about liberation wars and balkan wars , it 's a tragedy that civilians were involved in such atrocities . 
  revenge and anger can be justified somewhat . 
  i know your perspective , if you want to learn about mine , check out info about the burning of stara zagora or batak which has foreign sources of journalists from the states/uk . 
  i think nokia had some factories in europe , like in hungary ? 
  you can do your own research before planting doubts into people 's mind . 
  here 's an exempt from the wiki article : `` the company is headed by ceo arto nummela , and is headquartered in espoo near helsinki , in front of nokia 's headquarters . 
  hmd is made up of veteran nokia staff , [ 2 ] and develop smartphones and tablets running on the android platform . 
  [ 3 ] manufacturing and distribution is outsourced to foxconn 's fih mobile division . 
  [ 4 ] whilst nokia itself does not directly invest in hmd , it has a board member representative , sets mandatory requirements , and receives royalty payments for patents . '', 
  veterans from nokia + foxconn are making the phones . 
  i am definitely getting a new nokia android phone ( nokia 6 ) as soon as it becomes available . 
  you need a burner phone ? 
  is he your friend really ? 
  could n't the eu court do something about this case ? 
  you tend to appreciate more what you see on your holidays . 
  if you live in sofia , all of the tourist attractions are boring already . 
  from personal experience : alexander nevski cathedral is better than any of the orthodox churches i have seen in belgrade , ndk is one of the most intersting brutalist structures you can see anywhere and there are some interesting hotels like arena serdika in sofia where you literally have city ruins to check in the hotel 's lobby . 
  there 're lots of interesting things to see and do if you know where to look . 
  do yourself a favor and try to find interesting things to see and do in sofia , there 're lots of them and weekends will be better . 
  the mountain is 6-8 kms from the city center and if you live in the neighborhoods dragalevtsi or boyana it 's a walking distance until the national park vitosha starts . 
  i agree with you , some of the apartment buildings in the city center are in desperate need of restoration . 
  often the people who live there are old and believe it or not quite a few apartments are uninhabited . 
  the latter usually happens when the old person who lives dies and then the apartment is inherited by 2-3 children who can not decide on how to sell it or to rent it . 
  some of these buildings have not seen a facade renovation in decades . 
  also depending on the amount of smog in the day you can see the mountain more clearly . 
  if it 's windy the view will be better . 
  this is the best image i could find which in my mind shows the real view http://cash4bulgarianproperties.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/vitosha-boulevard-sofia.jpg, 
  bulgari strong . 
  as far as i know the only european country who still uses the name of its founding in 681 . 
  and what about the balkan peninsula ? 
  what about that ancient big empire that fell ? 
  you know byzantium . 
  with some of the most ancient places of christian worship falling to islam . 
  that aint europe either ? 
  the crime wave of 65 + years old is coming soon . 
  name a few ? 
  i am sad they forgot the serbians . 
  but to be honest i wish we could stop measuring dicks . 
  we like good bbq and rakia just as much as they do . 
  hey man , history is like news today , seems like there are a lot of alternative facts floating around . 
  so since i can not really go into a debate about history , let 's use geography instead . 
  please explain to me why there are 45 villages/cities with the same names in bulgaria and macedonia , source is google and compiled list can be found here : http://macedoniabg.blogspot.bg/ also , please tell me why after each balkan war/riot in macedonia , bulgaria was full of macedonian refugees ? 
  sofia is full of neighborhoods which were started as communities of macedonian refugees . 
  think for yourself man . 
  some truths can not be erased . 
  this is the orginal : http://gospodari.com/%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%b7%d0%b4%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b2%d1%8f%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b5-%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b4-%d1%82%d1%80%d1%8a%d0%bc%d0%bf-%d1%81-%d1%83%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%bd%d0%be-%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%be-%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%bb%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f-video118368.html admins , if the web site above works well outside of bulgaria you can change the link . 
  during the 90s protests in bulgaria one january it was very popular to sing `` whoever does not jump is red ( aka commie ) '' . 
  in my book , the dutch are completely unqualified to judge any languages . 
  i would trust only the average 70 years old luxembourgois to start judging the languages of western/central europe . 
  for slavic languages , i believe we , the bulgarians , as inventors of the cyrilic alphabet will be judges . 
  russian is okay but overly complicated and has stupid grammar , serbian is great for comedy standup etc, 
  this is where the witcher 3 cosplayers meetup will happen in 2017 . 
  bulgaria in fact returned some soldiers to turkey , without any due process . 
  bulgarian politicians are stupid as shit sometimes and do not defend any common laws or show principle . 
  not sure what happened of the poor souls which we sent back .
