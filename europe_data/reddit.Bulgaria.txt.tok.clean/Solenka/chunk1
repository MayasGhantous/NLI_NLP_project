hey , we have 0 % and i wonder why . 
  and here i though i was the dumbest in this subreddit , thank you . 
  wow , i really ca n't believe you 're being serious ... op just informed the subreddit with this post , that an * european * president 's kid has passed away . 
  that 's all there is to it - its news from europe just for clarification , here are the different definitions for the word [ propaganda ] ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/propaganda ) you may want to look at it . 
   but you need to understand that this is no news for someone that does n't live in bulgaria as you need to understand that this is europe 's subreddit , not bulgaria 's . 
   that 's the problem , you still think that you were just providing with information . 
  pretty ignorant words . 
  it is clear that you have a problem with simple news . 
  maybe it 's not real/important information for you or your country . 
  if it is , just scroll past it , no need to be a douche . 
  people do n't beg for your condolences , and even if they were - that 's not what propaganda is . 
   i 'm just trying to make you see why your submission is being marked as propaganda for some of us . 
  try harder . 
  the submission is not `` being marked as propaganda '' , you 're the one that thinks it has anything to do with propaganda . 
   you are almost asking us to express our condolences no , we 're almost informing you that our president 's child died . 
  how about this one : '' \u0427\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0430 '' not necessarily a difficult one , but would love to hear you try it . 
  the reddit hivemind , not just this sub . 
  you 're looking it the wrong way . 
  fertility is n't the only factor for population growth , it 's the number of the population itself . 
  in 1970 we were 5 billion , now we 're 7,5 . 
  the real problem is mathematical - exponential growth . 
  the more we are , the faster we multiply . 
  tl ; dr we 're still pretty fucked, 
  `` we will show them our peaceful ways , by force '', 
  and here i though we 're all humans . 
  do n't know how humanity could want `` world peace and love '' with that attitude . 
  as far as our news say , 2 months ago one of omega firm bus was set on fire , and because of that people think its not a terrorist act but mobs business . 
  i wo n't be surprised , everything sinks in corruption here . 
  i 'm not sure the balkans are * that * much in islam . . 
  i like how the circles are placed in their exact spot in eu ... except for russia . 
  why is russia on englands spot ? 
  well , they * have * been here for couple of years now ... 
  that 's `` ts '' or '' \u0446 '' . 
  now that you mention it , i should have wrote `` banitsa '', 
  did n't know it was burek in so many places , thanks , 
  its actually called rolled '' \u0411\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 '' or banica . 
  we have them here in bulgaria too . 
  very delicious , and very simple , its sheets of dough with cheese in it , rolled and baked . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yklpxqp_y0 this should shed some light on why scotland wants independence, 
  or slightly shitposting . 
  and the fact that turkish media is one of the most controlled by the government . 
  with what erdogan is doing with the country i do n't know what to believe that comes from there . 
  to be honest http://www.milliyet.com.tr/ does n't seem like an adequate news source . 
  this may shock you , but chewing with your mouth open can enhance the taste , and they are there to test the taste . 
  this is a weird way to say `` we 're going to continue accepting refugees here ( europe ) for many years to come '' this thing became from refugee influx `` crysis '' to obvious destabilization of europe . 
  the borders between eu countries became the exact opposite of what they 're supposed to represent/be . 
  building walls , tensions between eu countries etc. 
  can merkel just stop playing guilt martyr and realize what 's happening ? 
  or try to understand and respect rest of us 's opinion . 
  the one thing brussels believes is right , is the same thing that makes countries relations/borders corrode , changing their meaning to the exact opposite of what they should represent . 
  ( the borders in an union like ours ), 
  my bad . 
  good to know once again that we 're not an european country . 
  he tries to be original and funny , failing . 
  i have no idea whatsoever why you would ask such question . 
  it says right there : they 're from macedonia and as far as i remember macedonia/greece is in europe . 
  edit : their faces are pretty dirty , if the dark skin is throwing you away about them being european . 
  how exactly are you helping your country men by living like a dog ? 
  make them feel less shit because you 're feeling shit too ? 
  do n't want do disrespect your beliefs , this just does n't make even a little bit of sense to me . 
  fair enough . 
  nice photos is that way --  r/pics, 
  and you 're the typical bulgarian that can not respect opinion/views of others just because it 's negative . 
  well , bulgaria is a shit-hole , i may not be right , but that 's how i see it . 
  you dumb patriots is what 's keeping this country behind . 
  the post communistic `` its a pile of shit but its ours pile of shit '' is still ringing in your head . 
  this fake `` winter mood '' is whats 's positive ? 
  the whole city is literally covered in brown snow that block 's half the country but hey , i ruined your `` positive '' mood by stating that i do n't like snow + sofia . 
  fuck off please . 
  oh no , i said the truth about snow in sofia , what a downer . 
  i 'm not a driver but i think there 's a law about it and you should be with winter tiers . 
  how many people follow the law is something else :d not much enforcing of the law happening here , which is a shame . 
  who would respect/obey laws if they are not forced ? 
  typical bulgarian passive aggressive comment , thanks for the info . 
  hehe , search 30 minutes for a place where there 's no black dirty fucking snow to take the picture . 
  i love snow but hate it here . 
  this is joe , joe is a fucking taxi driver . 
  for his entire life joe learned only to drive a car for a living . 
  too bad for joe . 
  do n't get me wrong , but can we not be friends anymore ? 
  your `` we here now , we friends '' friendship is n't really appreciated . 
  really ? 
  * threats * is the word of choice ? 
  did turkey blew themselves couple of times then ? 
  mind that most `` settlements '' here are ghost settlements or may have up to two people . 
  half a million is a bit exaggerated . 
  which makes my sleeping at night easier . 
  you clearly did n't understand my question and are putting words in my mouth . 
  i 'm asking what would that something be ? 
  give ideas or options . 
  what do you mean by someone doing something ? 
  norway < 3 so beautiful and i do n't have problems with cold . 
  i 'm not sure this is real at all . 
  give us a little credit come on :d, 
  humans would throw a big rug over it and just cross , but animals do n't have rugs now do they . 
  it really should be called european crisis at this point . 
  merkel says european countries should increase refugee intake , and one week after every country starts building walls and increase tension between each other . 
  the real question is why are people continuing to ignore at their own will how fucking corrupt almost everything is . 
  most * governments * are corrupt and we 're talking about a sport federation . 
  do n't believe this crap , i hear that the warning shot was in the air , and ricocheted ... ... :d :d ...
