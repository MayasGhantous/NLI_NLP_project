  and it seems everyone in this thread is reading the title without actually clicking on the article to see that op just made this bullshit up . 
  you changed the title to fit your agenda . 
  shame . 
   just saying `` he did it because he 's a piece of shit '' without looking at how he became a piece of shit is why the situation is stagnating . 
  because he converted to islam and follows islamic code . 
  or is that too racist ? 
  all of those are true though , especially with the primaries there 's even proof wishful thinking i hope assange is n't really dead tho :(, 
  libertarianism + african culture ? 
  forget about it . 
  oh well , ca n't win them all i guess . 
  thankfully the austrian president is mostly a figurehead . 
  best of luck to fpo in the legislative election in 2 years , they seem to be polling well . 
  though 2016 has taught me that polls are not to be trusted . 
  if the cops ask , we 're muslim, 
  hey hot girl wan na procreate, 
  got ta be the big man himself , justin `` honor killings are n't barbaric '' trudeau justin `` if you kill your enemies , they win '' trudeau justin `` castro was a legendary revolutionary and orator '' trudeau justin `` the liberal party believes terrorists should keep their citizenship '' trudeau, 
  where have you been these past couple of years ? 
  `` anyone i do n't like works for russia ! '', 
  70 million ? 
  try 970 million dead in 2 years . 
  stop trying to hide the death toll , fascist . 
  maybe the eu should prove to ** us ** that it 's worth keeping it alive , instead of blaming their fall in popularity on outside factors . 
  all germanic countries ( except the uk ) have more obese men than women . 
  interesting . 
  hey man i know your mother is starving but do n't you think it 's a bit selfish not to give your money to ** my ** starving mother ? 
  not the case ? 
  you are throwing millions of dollars away , while gaining ** nothing ** in return . 
  in fact , you 're getting the opposite in return . 
  how many terrorist attacks , rapes , abuse of welfare , millions of dollars thrown away will it take ? 
  would you feed a homeless man if your own son is starving to death ? 
  i was talking about these migrants . 
  nice straw man . 
  i never said that . 
  all i said is to close the borders for these `` refugees '' . 
  if all of europe closes their borders to them , they ca n't come here . 
  if they 're off european soil , i do n't give a damn where they go . 
  and why is closing the borders to them not going to work ? 
  it worked for hungary . 
  you are naive , friend . 
  there 's that word again . 
  a nation looks after its own interests and its own people . 
  top priority . 
  if that does n't happen , then that nation is a puppet . 
  what the fuck, 
  race relations have never been great and they are getting worse since the 80s and 90s as white people are shifting towards becoming a minority . 
  not that i would know , since i do n't live there , but this is just my educated opinion . 
  see : the rise of blm . 
   you know damn well that you are not going to send back people who are real victims of torture and rape . 
  90 % of these `` refugees '' are opportunists and economic migrants . 
  they can go to hell for all i care about them . 
  then we change those laws . 
  we 're not taking any of you in . 
  we have our own problems to deal with and we do n't want to bring more problems on top of it . '', 
  how 's that for human rights ? 
  keeping cultures separate is what creates peace and diversity . 
  mashing them together creates chaos and war . 
  imagine like you 're mixing all the play-doh colors together . 
  you 'll just end up with a brown-pukeish piece of shit . 
  dude so what you 're saying is i 'm licherally hitler ? 
   discrimination and refusal to give opportunities does n't help at all . 
  show kindness to them and you will be perceived as weak and taken advantage of . 
  where 'd you steal the computer from , hassan ? 
  romanians are n't gypsies . 
  the cap would be zero , in a perfect world . 
  it 's their own fault . 
  and they 're called gypsies , not roma . 
  do n't tarnish the beautiful name of rome . 
  i 'd much rather live under a benevolent dictatorship than an unstable democracy which gets nothing done . 
  how about west bulgaria ? 
  this is getting downvoted ? 
   wtf dude you 're 70 years old !!!, 
  why are you reminiscing about when you were 20 and were healthy and strong even though you obviously ca n't do anything to bring those times back and are n't hurting anyone by being proud of what you once were while also not neglecting the fact that you 're still in not too rough shape ???? 
  i 'm literally shaking rn, 
   i could not believe my eyes and choked a little even . 
  are you serious ? 
  big deal . 
  there 's nothing wrong with being proud of your own history . 
  i 'm 100 % sure she did n't want to annex your people and force them into camps and make them learn hungarian . 
  hungary is great . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i see something in that pie chart that 's 2.80 % more than it should be . 
  fucking leave assad alone already , syria was absolutely fine with him in charge before the civil war . 
  we need to be supporting peaceful and stabile dictatorships in the middle east , not tearing them down for `` freedom and democracy '' ( see iraq and libya , total anarchy ) . 
  of course this is all done because of the oil . 
  you 'll likely never see anyone trying to bring `` freedom and democracy '' in north korea or any of the numerous central african dictatorships . 
  i dunno about you great year, 
  there 's that word again . 
  how about deported ? 
  `` hey . 
  what 's up ? '', 
  `` good . 
  you ? '', 
  `` good . '', 
  yo waddup banana split it 's me your pal again remember to vote le pen , 
  they 're just reaping the benefits of diversity . 
  stop being intolerant . 
  you 're just desperately looking for things to be offended by, 
  hey man calm down you can always vote le pen if you hate that this guy beat your beloved juppe  ) ), 
  thanks but it has nothing to do with the article, 
  what ?
