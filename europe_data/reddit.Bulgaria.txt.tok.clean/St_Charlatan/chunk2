  you 're welcome  not my find , though , but circulated by friends on fb . 
  i 'm glad you like it !, 
  mourning about some oligarch 's losing a bit of property bought with money of unclear origin rather than mourning about one 's country being sucked by greedy oligarchs and nepotist elite - oh , how rational and patriotic , you comrade ... p.s. 
  then blame the imperialists for sure ... 
  was n't he sande filipovski actually ? 
  naaaah , they 've stolen our only true fake early 20th c. thracian autochtonism !!!, 
  this is our theory , not theirs , and all the slavs are bulgar !, 
  i 'm grabbing a knife and a fork and going to fight for this land instead of going to lunch ... 
  he must have drunk too much coffee in october ... 
  i was asking about [ king 's coup ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/king_michael%27s_coup ) actually . 
  been there , saw some historic material and learned there was a switch made by the king himself , now reading for more details . 
  ( wow , a monarch acting together with communists - we are true wonderlands here !, 
  bulgaria had one former prince as a prime minister with a president from the socialist party at the same time . ), 
  it 's a part of the heritage of a modernist movement in the early soviet architectute , called [ constructivism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constructivist_architecture ), 
  you have always been more pro-western oriented , both culturally and politically , more austrian/hungarian influences and cultural ties with france and italy , i think . 
  we were easily fooled under the flag of ` slav brotherhood ' ... how actually did the switch happen during wwii ? 
  trendy restaurant on top , did n't visit it because we were more fond of beer pubs , 
  because slavs , that 's why . 
  some unique consonants mainly . 
  reminds me of that old cartoon about asterix and the golden sickle : wneh travelling to lutecia with obelix on foot , he makes a rem\u0430rk on the roman aqueduct in a valley : `` look how romans ruined the landscape with their modern constructions ! '', 
  due to the former link being disabled , [ here is the same video again ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29wl7_qylw0 ), 
  actually the same can be said about bulgaria . 
  we have small arab minority in sofia , but most of them have either studied here or moved about 10-20 years ago , often running their own small businesses , and less came later during the arab springs unrests . 
  the newcoming immigrants usually take a rest on their way to western europe here , but do n't want to stay . 
  they wait somewhere in the country or in the shitty hostels in the centre of sofia or at a place in the suburbs for the human-traffickers to take them and drive them further , or try to contact their relatives who already got there . 
  our social systhem is under-funded and we do n't have good integration policies for both our minorities ( mainly roma/gypsies ) and the immigrants . 
  errr , kinda missed that , i 'm going to check  edit : macedonia is not so pro-russian in its politics ( like serbia , for example ) , due to the heavy reliance on eu association funds , so i doubt a bit some people there have true reasons to mess with this , besides money . 
  yeah , very good !, 
  could have emphasized on strongholds and walls , and also on the old joke about all the empires that conquered us and later vanished , but quite good after all , 
  guys , you rock !, 
  the best video on the topic from the balkans by now  europe exploded recently with funny vids on `` murrica first , our country second !, 
  '' , some are really really great , let 's collect them all , 
  yeah , it was the same here in 2013 . 
  few pensioners , taken to the capital with buses and some speakers that pretended to believe themselves . 
  about 500 people , i tnink . 
  the place is narrow , we were close to each other and one could n't grasp it in one look . 
  always expected trump to be much more of a populist , than to follow his words , but optimism seems to have blinded me . 
  never thought the us will make such a sharp turn towards isolationism to a scale unprecedented for many decades now . 
  seems quite contradictory to his nato policy , but we 'll see what else he 's about to mess up . 
  born in sofia and having been to the capitals of about a half of the balkan states ( istanbul , belgrade , bucharest and athens ) , i must admit that although it was bombed much more than sofia , belgrade is still more beautiful due to the heavy central-european influence in architecture . 
  due to the fact that serbs liberated earlier from the ottoman empire they had more time to make it a trully imposing city . 
  actually , the main difference between most of the neighbouring states before wwii was the scale and the architectural styles of their capitals . 
  the rest were smaller towns and almost equally poor peasants ( if you look at the gdp data for the period ) . 
  nationalist `` logic '' is quite fine : eu gives bucks - eu good . 
  eu has standards and demands - eu bad . 
  the same with russian money , i think - but usually demands come later when money get too sweet and hard to be denied . 
  go on , guys , show us all how to do it again and again , fighting for your country and all your achievements by now !, 
  a great city with great history !, 
  must add the literacy of commonn folk of veliki novgorod and its surroundings in the middle ages was quite high and also there was a tradepost of german trade cities league - the hansa . 
  r.i.p. , gorden kaye !, 
  for the ability to make fun even of ourselves is a part of what makes us truly european - not fully constrained by any nationality , ideology or religion , but living , striving and trying to be happy against all odds . 
  konyovitsa = place with horses banishora = a small bathhouse ( edit : or a small tower as well ), 
  when i was in berlin in the end of 2014 , some people were walking and smoking here and there , seemingly undisturbed , so it was a matter of time ( did n't know joint was still illegal in germany , never checked it up ) ... 
  like a winter fairytale , 
  as a too close ussr ally , there were many monuments of this kind in bulgaria ( and brutalism , too ) . 
  [ here is an old photo of one ] ( http://www.kab-sofia.bg/images/stories/statii/2012-07-10/ndk/01.jpg ) , still standing before the national palace of culture ( not visible in the pictures ) in the centre of our capital sofia , now in a slow state of decay . 
  it is dedicated to the 1300th anniversary since the founding of bulgaria , that was largely commemorated by the communist state in year 1981 , when the regime began having many nationalistic features . 
  due to its unclear forms and imagery , citizens used to call it various ( some obscene ) names , such as `` the seven-winged five-dick thing '' , `` the fallen messerschmidt '' or `` the dinosaur '' . 
  [ the same monument from another angle ] ( http://kab-so.com/rknova/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1300-godini-bg-otkrivane.jpg ) [ the monument to the bulgarian-soviet amity in varna ] ( http://rezervaciq.com/img/objects/sights_616_91099155nikola_mihov_forget_your_past_19.jpg ) big grey concrete thing with soldiers . 
  and we even have a communist flying saucer from concrete ( hello , bratislava !, 
  ) , but ours was built to commemorate some anniversary from the first gathering of bulgarian workers ' party that was the predecessor of bulgarian communist party in the late 19th century ( when some of them were actually social democrats ) : [ buzludza monument ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buzludzha ) . 
  some still wish that former communists and all their agents and appointed businessmen could launch it and fly away ... 
  wow !, 
  you made it a great short essay , man , 
  [ bulgaria was first ] ( https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--gcfyaf8j--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1432205701530868621.jpg ) ( thanks to scott kelly 's photos of aurora borrealis from space )  [ source ] ( http://gizmodo.com/51-favourite-photographs-from-astronaut-scott-kellys-fi-1730881885 ) edit : a site with larger pics . 
  obviously , coats of arms have always been drawn by boys ... 
  nah , you 're [ lithuanjah ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdb-8elew8g ) , come and unite , you ca n't hide it , rasta brotha , 
  i think they count the campaign led by wladyslaw iii jagello and john hunyadi in the balkan parts of the ottoman empire in 15th c. so , you basically invaded serbian and bulgarian lands to fight against the ottoman turks for the liberation of these christian nations as well . 
  bulgarians had their version of the old slavic names of the months until about 200 years ago , when we gradually began to accept modern latin names . 
  but they still can be seen in old manuscripts or church frescoes of calendars and i find them very poetic because of their links to seasons and changes in nature  in spoken language there are remains of these names - january is `` the big sechko '' ( from `` sechen '' ) and february is `` the small sechko '' because of their length . 
  [ so , here is a list  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavic_calendar ), 
  do n't forget it was a socialist bulgaria back then - religion was put aside at best ( or even persecuted up to the 60s-70s ) , so there is hardly a way to remember lots of rituals that were n't held at home . 
  actually in older times there were male rituals in rivers and lakes ( incl . 
  dances ) on jordanovden ( epiphany ) and young women being splashed with water or wading the cold winter rivers today ( the winter holiday of st.john the baptist ) . 
  c'mon , wo n't anybody say political correctness has gone wild now ? 
  i liked it a lot ... 
  it 's almost the same here in bulgaria . 
  during the protests in 2013 against a socialist-led government , propaganda sites connected all the protest leaders with soros and his npos . 
  all of this bs comes from russia together with their hatred to the us and nato , suspicion towards eu ( their regulations which ` destroyed our industry ' and the gay rights which ` will destroy our morals ' ) , combined with strong nationalism and awe to putin . 
  well , i 'm wondering just about the ' 5 tribes ' version , because maybe only one tribe of the five came here ( or some parts of a few tribes , so if great old bulgaria was a union of five tribes , then no ohter country , founded by some of kubrat 's sons could unite all of these ) . 
  i know about the ` mixed people ' , causing unrests , too ... 
  there was another version on the etnonym , ` sable hunters ' , i think ... 
  amazing  and here in eastern europe we are drowned every winter with some fake news about `` chrismas abolished `` or changed to `` seasons 's greetings '' here and there not to hurt migrants ' feelings ( or about oktoberfest and so on ... ) . 
  russian/russian-funded propaganda , obviously ; i hate this . 
  came from a trip to london soon , christmas greetings and decorations everywhere , 
  well , animals do n't cure autism , but they may help some related conditions . 
  as far as i can remember , some dog breeds ( labs or golden retreivers ) are used , too . 
  these are calm and loving , so sometimes autistic kids that have problems with contacting other beings more easily start touching and cuddling the animals . 
  on the other hand , horse-riding has been used to help children with difficulties in moving because it affects leg muscles in a way , i 'm not sure exactly how . 
  actually , both species - dogs and horses are among the earliest domesticated and most deeply connected with humans , both have made even strong emotional bonds with us ( dogs with their lords , horses with riders - there is a lot of research on the topic ) and that 's why now people use them for physical and emotional recovery ... 
  yes , so to say , because it 's less fizzy . 
  then , to me coke tastes sweet ( not as much as pepsi , tho ) with a slight bitter nuance maybe , while kofola has a bit of sour , that 's why i call it more caffeinated . 
  i drank kofola while in czech republic and slovakia , so it was the same as the one served for tourists in primorsko in the summer . 
  maybe about 10-12 years ago , there was black cola ( black coke ) if anyone can remember , which was the ultimate mixture of coke and coffee . 
  sometimes my heart raced because of it ... 
  tried it first in a town at bulgarian black sea coast where many czechs come and loved it  less sweet and poppy than coke , more of a caffeine taste . 
  it does n't have vowels or you usually do n't mark some * short * vowels ?!, 
  it almost looks like the way vowels were often omitted in old church slavonic and replaced with some lines and signs above a group of consonants ... 
  we bulgarians have , like 4/5 of them , too with the same or almost the same meaning , or had them in older times and dialects . 
  for example , rt = ridge ; vrt is an old word for garden and i think somewhere somewhen we also had brk = moustache ...
