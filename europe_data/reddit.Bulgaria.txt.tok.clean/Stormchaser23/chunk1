that 's false , sorry . 
  most of the gypsies in bulgaria re muslim . 
  `` the nation , which once enjoyed robust economic growth , has been struggling to recover from the 2008 financial crisis . '', 
  which country did actually recover ? 
  if anything the situation in catalonia proves that big centralized government is not working properly . 
  so it 's ironic that the far-left parties want to secede from spain which are part of the problem .

  the republicans often call the democrats `` communists '' . 
  i think of it as emotional reaction rather than objective view . 
  a party which opressed the people for 45 years of dictatorship . 
  killed most of the intelectual eilite and many more were taken in concentration camps all over the country . 
  now they are proud with their past , they call themselves the centenarian ( 100 years old party ) . 
  most of us are sick of this . 
  yes , they are n't communist and i never said that . 
  i never said they will turn bulgaria commuist . 
  i just wanted to give people the background . 
  bulgaria does n't have a big social-democratic party which is n't connected with the communist regime and my friends who are leftists are forced to vote right . 
  vote for rb . 
  i do n't think they are perfect , but they are just way better than the others . 
  it 's not the same . 
  there are many members of bulgarian socialist party who were once members of the communist party . 
  it 's not only that . 
  their former leader was sergei stanishev ( 2005-2014 ) , leader of pes for the last 3 years . 
  his father is responsible for the death of 30 , 000 anti-commuist . 
  who were killed without trial , or sentence . 
  bsp is a legitimate successor to the bcp . 
  well , not exactly . 
  rb is million years ahead of every other party/coaltion . 
  as i see in the commments most bulgarian redditors agree with me . 
  let 's be fair bzns is not as big as the other 4 . 
  ( 15k votes in last elections ) if we have to be precise there are 7 parties in rb . 
  good job kremlin . 
  it sounds like kpop . 
  well for the most part it is n't . 
  i mean intelligent people know that things that happened 20 + years ago should n't be relevant in today 's country-coutry interactions . 
  i meant that all the balkan countries hate turkey ( have negative feelings ) because of the otthoman empire . 
  i do n't think romanian people can hate bulgaria more than they hate turkey . 
  i do n't think bozhkov is in top 10 . 
  you are right . 
  most of the bsp voters are elderly people , but most elderly people are not voting for bsp . 
  my brain hurts . 
  actually gerb had more votes in the 60 + segment of the population in the last election . 
  it 's true that there are many `` red '' grandma 's but there are as many `` blue '' grandma 's . 
  georgi glushkov , todor stoikov , the ivanovi twins come to my mind first . 
  i hope it is [ todor zhivkov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/todor_zhivkov ) - the dictator during communism/socialism . 
  but there are quite few people who love him , because he reminds them of their youth , when they were healthy and beatifull . 
  we had recent success in tennis and volleyball , but basketball will always be the number 2 sport in bulgaria no matter what . 
  when the local team from ( varna , botevgrad , samokov or yambol ) is playing levski or lukoil the hall will be always full . 
  i 'm not a huge of baskteball but when these games happen i always go and see them live . 
  there is not a single tv station that is covering the volleyball leauge , but you can always watch bulgarian basketball leauge on tv7 . 
  there are very few people who watch volleyball or tennis tournaments , but there are so many people who are passionate about nba . 
  tl : dr volleyball and tennis are trending but basketball will always be there . 
  edit1 : people only watch volleyball and tennis when bulgaria or bulgarian is playing but nothing outside that . 
  i never knew it was so hard to read slavic languages for latin language speakers . 
  i know for a fact that the greek started putting some land mass on the top of the olympus ( 2916 ) to beat bulgarian musala ( 2925 ) . 
  then the bulgarian government started putting land mass themselves . 
  putting some rocks on the top of a mountain is the most patriotic thing you can do . 
  for few years now these are the only police cars i see on the streets . 
  i remember there were police car ladas but in 6-7 years have n't seen one . 
  this is what gives as result when u type `` police cars bulgaria '' in google .

  * 800 ^ ^ ^ ^ he.didn ` t. 
  they are showing only the cool ones . 
  only in poland though . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ europe.is.full.of.atheists . 
  there are marshrutkas in varna as well . 
  as far as i remember the `` ticket '' costs 1,40 leva ( 0.7 euro ) and the bus costs 1 lev ( 0.5 euro ) . 
  this is so biased . 
  i mean it 's cool to hate on russia but this is too much . 
  it 's a private bank . 
  people in 21st century must know that there is a risk deposting money in a bank . 
  the law says that all deposits < = 100k are guaranteed by the state . 
  now all our money will be spent on covering the loses of several really rich people . 
  the regulators have failed in their job , but taxpayers should n't pay the price . 
  \u00cd hope georgieva is not seriously considered . 
  martin callanan came in bulgaria 3 weeks ago to meet the leader of bbt , but i guess things did n't go well . 
  he had interview in one of the national televesions and he said they will join epp . 
  but you can never know with this guy . 
  he can join every single party for the right amount of money . 
  the leader of bbt recently told that they would join epp , but the epp claimed they never had such conversation with him . 
  edit : i checked his fb . 
  he is having conversation with alde , epp and ecr, 
  it is a party created by the bulgarian and russian oligarchy . 
  all of the sane people know the leader of the party ( former journalist ) is a joke . 
  the party made the most expensive campaign in the history of bulgaria ( est. 
  18 milion and the limit is 2 mil ) . 
  he was literally everywhere on tv , posters and so on . 
  so the uneducated ( dumb ) people voted for him . 
  he bought thousands of gypsy votes . 
  he is probably the richest journalist in the world and he ca n't give an explanation where are his money from . 
  he is not eurosceptic but he is pro-russia . 
  gerb ( citizens for european development of bulgaria ) - center-right . 
  bsp ( bulgarian socialist party ) - left.dps ( movement for rights and freedoms ) - center.bbc ( bulgaria with no censorship ) - left maybe.rb ( reformist block ) - right . 
  the ancestor of bsp is bcp ( bulgarian communist party ) , so they are very pro-russia . 
  dps is the party of the turkish minority in bulgaria and bbc is a project of the bulgarian-russian oligarchy . 
  bulgaria gerb ( epp ) - 29,9 % - 6 bsp ( s&d ) - 19,5 % - 4 dps ( alde ) - 18,2 % - 4 bbc ( no affiliation ) 10,8 % - 2 rb ( epp ) - 6,3 % - 1 the far right party did n't make it ( 3,7 % ) , which is a huge win . 
  it 's considered a huge loss for bsp , because the first in their list is the leader of s&d - sergei stanishev . 
  any member of estonia 's cabinet has bigger economic impact onn the world than london 's mayor . 
  that 's a bit ignorant . 
  comparing mayor to a head of state .
