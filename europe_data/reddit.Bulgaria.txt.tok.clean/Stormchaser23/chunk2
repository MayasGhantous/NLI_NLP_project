  because you italians seem to blame only germany for everything . 
  germany has 5 times more refugees than italy . 
  i 've never said things are fine in varna , butt they could be a lot worse . 
  it 's better than almost all cities in bulgaria in terms of standard of living , employment rate , growth ( economic and demographic ) . 
  stop typing stuff you have no idea about . 
  genocide is mass murder of civilians based on their religion , race or ethnicity . 
  this was a genocide and it does n't matter that the people who did it had reasons . 
  i am not 100 % sure . 
  i was playing this video game called `` ruler of nations '' . 
  in the game the security council consists of the winners of wwii ( russia , uk , usa , china and france ) and 10 other member which were different every year . 
  i do n't know why 47 countries voted on this resolution . 
  germany is not a permanent member , because they lost wwii . 
  the permanent members of the security council of the un are the winners of wwii ( uk , france , usa , russia and china ) . 
  they can veto every resolution . 
  part of the rest of the ~ 190 countries in the un are the temporary members . 
  they ca n't veto a resolution . 
  you are no longer refugee when you cross the greek/turkish border . 
  ( no lawyer , just what i 've read on the news . ), 
  where is this ? 
  it souned really gross to me . 
  today i asked my parents about putting honey in youghurt and they told me when they were kids it was a common thing . 
  i am completely mind blown . 
  i 've never seen or heard of this . 
  honey ? 
  please do n't do that . 
  most politicans will smile and dismiss the question with ease . 
  they will start talking how much they 've done for their country and in the grand scheme of things how irrelevant is this question . 
  the ottoman empire occupied all the territory of bulgaria ( nowadays ) and all the balkans and parts of ukraine . 
  it 's nothing like the situatuion with ukraine and russia , because they are both christian countries and share the * same language * . 
  i 've read it in a few places after the last 2 terrorist attacks and today . 
  it 's not like all the people are that well informed on turkish politics to make or understand such kind of a joke . 
  there is this joke in bulgaria that whenever something happens in turkey there should be no investigation since it 's always the pkk . 
  i am not a citizen of a joke country in any sense . 
  bulgaria was one of the fastest growing economies in europe in the 2000s and was one of few countries in europe that managed quite well with the mortage crisis in 2007 and the bank crisises in europe in the next few years . 
  bulgaria mantains low deficit and low unemployment rate . 
  the growth of gdp for bulgaria in 2014 and 2015 is 1,7 and 2,2 % . 
  in / r/europe people do n't know much ( anything ) about bulgaria and writing such stuff is misleading . 
  i am a bit biased , but i want to you give you some background , because the op is a bit biased in presenting this thing as well : 1 ) significant part of the civil society ( considered to be the most progressive part of bulgarian society ) that was [ protesting against the last cabinet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%e2%80%9314_bulgarian_protests_against_the_oresharski_cabinet ) does n't like the tv show staff that initiated the referendum . 
  they ( me as well ) think that the owner/presenter of the show is trying to create ground for a new political party and this referendum is a publicity stunt . 
  he tried to run for pm , but it was a total disaster . 
  they ( we ? ), 
  see him as part of the establishment . 
  2 ) after the last parliamantary elections ( late 2014 ) the president resumed campaign to initiate referendum on 3 questions - the same as the 1st , 3rd and 4th in this thread . 
  but he fell short on the signutares and the parliament [ agreed to hold a referendum on only the 4th question in late 2015 ] ( http://sofiaglobe.com/2015/10/25/bulgarias-electronic-voting-referendum-falls-short/ ) . 
  the results were 70 % - yes with an 35 % turnout . 
  3 ) most people who passionately support the referendum are very young people 18-23 years old and/or are not much involved in political life . 
  first one of our government agency has to ensure all the signatures are valid . 
  ( there is good chance 20-30 % of them are not valid ) 2 . 
  president has 6 months to pick a date the referendum to be held . 
  more people have to vote than on the last parliamentary election - 3,3 mil . 
  people , so that the referendum has judicial meaning . 
  ( i am quoting wikipedia-i do n't understand that part ) 4 . 
  if less than 3,3 mil . 
  people and more than 20 % vote-the parliament must discuss it . 
  first one of our government agency has to ensure all the signatures are valid . 
  ( there is good chance 20-30 % of them are not valid ), 
  the rules this referendum to be valid are really hard to match . 
  more people have to vote than on the last parliamentary election - 3,3 mil . 
  people . 
  i think it will be really hard to get this many people to vote . 
  bulgaria ( part of eastern europe ) is the 4th oldest parliamentary democracy in europe . 
  you should n't think of yourself less if you are from eastern europe . 
  we gave a lot to this world . 
  correct . 
  in a previous election there were 28 mps elected by majoritary voting ( out of 240 ) and the rest are elected in a proportional system . 
  6 ) the law enforcment minister appoints them . 
  ( 99 % sure about this ), 
  there is immunity , but i do n't think this is an issue . 
  our ex law enforcment minister and some other mps have been trialed unsuccessfully . 
  our judicial is completely broken and corrupt and removing immunity for mps wo n't change that . 
  bolded words are in bulgarian . 
  ' \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0446 ' , ' \u043f\u0440\u044f\u043c\u043e ' make sense in bulgarian . 
  ' \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e ' = ' ** \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 ** ' = not long ago for button we use also ' ** \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0435 ** ' which is similiar to ' \u043a\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0430 ' . 
  for grief we can use ' ** \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442 ** ' . 
  were n't they arested ? 
  in bulgaria they get 33 euro/month for personal spending and they cost us 570 euro/month . 
  it 's by far the most popular show in bulgaria . 
  was the blue square in power when you joined the eu ? 
  is the big red square a new thing ? 
  how much socialist are they ? 
  i think we should make a push for more transperancy . 
  the problem with the us elections are the super pacs and other types of unaccountable campaign contributions . 
  1 ) i remember when ukip lost big time and this sub was really happy about the uk majoritory voting system . 
  i think that in 20 years majoritory voting system will be beneficial . 
  it takes power from the party leadership and gives it to the people . 
  2 ) government should n't subsidise parties . 
  that 's not what government is for . 
  3 ) i voted against compulsory voting , because it is a really authoritorian policy . 
  not all the people who voted on the refendum are stupid . 
  i do n't like the guy who proposed it , but i agree with him on some of the issues . 
  trump is more peaceful candidate than clinton . 
  he has stated many times he wants to get along with russia . 
  we did n't chose russia . 
  our next president will be a nato general who studied and lived in the usa . 
  his vp ( which i personally do n't like ) is a 2 term mep from pes . 
  maybe lower your tax rates ? 
  this is a very insulting statement . 
  what ethnicity were the people living in this region of serbia before the balkan and ww1 wars ? 
   i ca n't watch black cat , white cat without bulgarian or english subs and i 've watched the movie more than 3-4 times . 
  i ca n't watch black cat , white cat without bulgarian or english subs and i 've watched the movie more than 3-4 times .
