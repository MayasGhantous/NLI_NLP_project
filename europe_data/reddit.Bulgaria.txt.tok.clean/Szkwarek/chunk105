  not so much if you ' r from european countries though . 
  you might have problems `` integrating '' then i guess . 
  [ sofia is cloudy and rainy at the moment , but that makes it super cozy ] ( http://picturesbg.info/images/albums/7/12908985191.jpg ) [ this one 's from another year , but how it usually looks on the ground .

  the baltics is eastern europe by any criteria - geographic , demographic , economic , geo-political ... 
  sorry , you ca n't into nordic . 
  and a `` white person '' can do that in regards to modern day racism and institutionalized discrimination of white people in many place on earth ( south african republic , zimbabwe , saudi arabia ... ) and asian person can do it in regards to discrimination in many places towards asians , a black person can do it for the same reason , a middle-eastern person , an amerindian etc. 
  you point looses complete sense - all people , of all races , have been and are discriminated in some way at some place . 
  what 's the point in saying then that her people are too ? 
  especially as a remark to a couple of guys dicussing something entirely different - the notion the turks are historicall oppressed as a country and the claim someone made they were `` muslim liberators '' . 
  it jsut feels out of place and pointless . 
  but the guy you wrote that too u/projectmayhem666 was answering the statement by another user that `` someone out there already used to call ottoman empire `` muslim liberators '' '' . 
  it was therefore a question of historical oppression , not the turkish immigrants in europe the past 50 years . 
  he asked how come turkey ( meaning the ottomans ) was oppressed as a nation , when they themselves had balkan slaves under occupation . 
  bringing the turkish immigrants to europe into the question by you is entirelly irrelevant to the poitns of these two users . 
  ah ok , lots of bulgarians put a big bg at the end so it confused me . 
  oh i did n't see the guy 's flair was voivodina , i thought eu balkan states . 
  btw , why the bg on your name , if from serbia ? 
  do n't the syrians concentrate in the east of turkey , which i was under the impression was vastly different culturally from the west , in terms of being much more like the mid-east , islamic , religious , traditional etc. 
  and many syrians on the other hand were quite educated and secular before the war . 
  so would there really be such a cultural clash in the most religious , rural part of turkey ? 
  do n't they need the same documents to go to balkan countries as they do to go to western europe ? 
  both are eu , so do n't both have the same requirements ? 
  the u.s. per capita gap is higher than all european countries , because those include the ones ruined by communism . 
  ( like mine ) why lump 500 million together and compare them with 320 million ? 
  take 320 million of europe 's richest countries and see if there 's a gap then . 
  so now the whole turkish nation is oppressed because its immigrants were at some point ? 
  are there immigrants of a any nation that have n't experienced racism at some point ? 
  you do know that anyone 's comment history remains and can be seen by everyone , right ? 
  anyone can go to my account and see not even 10 % of my comments concern russia , so why lie just to try and make a point in an argument ? 
  `` your kind '' i used referred to the radical wing of russophilic/communist bulgarians who openly wish bulgaria was occupied by the kremlin . 
  ( and celebrate every year the day it happened in 1944 ) i 'm not sure why you decided `` your kind '' is inflamatory , i did n't mean it that way back then , but right now i certainly would consider them ( since you ' v asked about them ) as the lowest of scum that lives in our country . 
  open traitors who 'd wish our 1300 year old state absorbed and who celebrate the mass murder of bulgarians by the red army in 1944 every year . 
  i doubt you 'd describe them any different if you had such a percentage of people in your country , who openly celebrated operation barbarossa every year or dreamt of russia being annexed by washington . 
  no i did n't mean that , i meant dilluted in the sense they deny what is modern day fyrom had a population 100 years ago that identified predominantly as bulgarian and spoke bulgarian , as the vast majority of ethnographers of the time show ( hence the maps ) , and so do the ottoman records . 
  bulgaria fought in the second balkan war and first world war to unify with a region that held a large chunk of the bulgarian nation , but was occupied by the serbs in 1912 , who refused a redistribution of the ottoman lands on ethnic basis . 
  no , but i am sure you 'll enlighten me . 
  roughly 1 male for 2 female . 
  why are 90 % of the comments of a bulgarian guy on reddit about russia ? 
  like , i know very well your kind are practically open national traitors and proud of how much you 'd rather you were russian and bulgaria part of russia , but i wonder how it 's rationalized in your own head . 
  horribly wrong . 
  my best teachers from youngest to oldest age were male . 
  in first grade i was 6 and will still remember till death my history teacher , who also was the principle of the school , and how he sparked the flame in me that made me study history at university and love it to this day . 
  my literature teacher from 4th grade onwards was probably the coolest guy i ' v met and a great male role model . 
  meanwhile i remember some terrible , unsuitable female teachers . 
  your conclusion is entirely baseless . 
  on average . 
  no , it 's because the us became the leader of the capitalist world , making business with the countries in it during the cold war and spreading its culture there . 
  people learned english to make business with the us , not to read dickens . 
  that 's why it was n't spread to eastern europe durign the cold war despite the relevance of english history and colonialism - they just did business with russia , and so our parents speak russian instead . 
  we learned english after 1991 because we became part of the world that was dominated economically and culturally by the us . 
  i am actually quite pleasantly surprised by this episode . 
  the issue around the balkan wars has been very much diluted here by bulgaria 's neighbours , who would refuse to admit the vast majority of the population of what is today fyrom was inhabited by bulgarians . 
  if they were to admit this it would make them thieves and not the bulgarians `` greedy for territory '' , so i do n't expect them to ever do it . 
  i wonder what did european ethnographers at the time think of macedonia 's population : [ french ] ( https://jaddeyekabir.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/balkans-ethnic_1861.jpg ) [ english ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/ernst-ravenstein-balkans-ethnic-map-1880.jpg ) [ german ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/bulgarians_in_1912.jpg ) [ austrian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/ethnic_map_of_balkans_-_german_1882.jpg ) [ russian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/ethnic_map_of_balkans_-_russian_1867.jpg ) [ german consul in adrianople , using ottoman census ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/ethnographic_map_of_european_turkey_from_1877_by_carl_sax.jpg ) [ american ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/distribution_of_races_on_the_balkans_in_1922_hammond.png ) [ german again ] ( http://kroraina.com/makedonija/karti/ethno/volkerkartevonmittel-undsudosteuropa.jpg ) [ swiss german ] ( https://www2.bc.edu/~heineman/maps/ethnic.jpg ), 
  ergo it is for men as difficult to be teachers as it is for women to be miners because their brains are different ? 
  there 's physical restrictions to being a miner . 
  there are n't any to being a teacher . 
  they ' r dead . 
  there are , indeed idiots who blame the actual refugees from syria for economic migrants , but i think they are a minority . 
  most are angry at the lumping together of actual refugees with , indeed many , purely economic migrants from out of syria . 
  people like me , who in fact want us to wellcome every single syrian refugee ( and eritrean ) into europe because they actually , genuinly need it , but get particurarly angry a whole bunch of economic migrants from nigeria or pakistan end up taking spaces for refugees and give society a reason to lump all together and be opposed to any migrants at all . 
  you 'll certainly die if you keep them . 
  your economy at least , when no investor wants to touch that toxic labour environment . 
  already there 's a proper french capital flow to much less-regulated london . 
  just watched miasto ' 44 / warsaw 44 ' movie about the warsaw uprising , so these shots almost made me tear up a bit at how the city 's risen from the ashes . 
  damn , the albanians are the only neighbour we have n't fought since medieval times it seems . 
  i 'd love for us to get ohrid and the south , skopje for you , so each gets their former medieval capital . 
  precisely due to the albanians i think it might become more important , as the country just ca n't remain the same . 
  it 's the most volatile construct on the balkans after kosovo , and most likely to fall apart . 
  the redistribution of the pieces will bring back the relevance of the question of ethnic identity . 
  and who knows , maybe for us fourth time 's the charm ? 
  i ' v actually heard the ones in the north-east are serbomans , and the one around ohrid to the west bulgarophiles . 
  surprisingly . 
  there has been a completely acceptable debate on the nature of human rights in political science for the past 200 years . 
  people like me who studied this are made to read for example jeremy bentham , who describes the notion of human rights as `` nonsense upon stilts '' , and argue the points in class . 
  a lot of both modern and past political theorists reject the notion on many different grounds , without that meaning they are radicals , nazis or people who wish others to suffer . 
  it ' a a complex political debate you have just dismissed lighthandedly because you never really thought about it as an issue with different sides to it . 
  the only reason it slowed down was because of the crackdown on corruption , making the local burreaucracy unable or affraid to embezzle as much funds as it used to . 
  bulgaria only has a higher rate because we still have n't cracked down on it so the embezzling is going full speed . 
   well that depends which yugoslavia , the later one we did n't certainly rule , the first one eh maybe considering the royal family was serbian . 
  its the second one that invented macedonians . 
  the one we did n't have a stronger influence on than others . 
  i am interrested , who did ? 
  capital was belgrade , the serbs dominated the burreaucracy and the army , whilst the croats did the economy , so who ? 
   we had control over macedonia before too , 13th century and onwards with the serbian empire whose capital was in skoplje itself , after its fall it was ruled by serbian lords . 
  by `` onwards '' you mean less than 100 years . 
  bulgarians first settled there in the 7th century , then it joined the first bulgarian empire for 400 years , then the second for another 200 , and in the 19th century it was one of the centres of bulgarian national revival . 
  a huge part of bulgaria 's revolutionary freedom fighters , artists and later statesmen came from there . 
  the referendum on church belonging in the 1860s resulted in the region voting firmly to be part of the bulgarian church . 
  western ethnography firmly puts the region as primarily inhabited by bulgarians in the time period , and ottoman census from a few years before the liberation of bulgaria put almost a quarter of the entire bulgarian nation in what is modern macedonia . 
  in 1901 there were , again according to the ottoman archives , around 4500 schools in the region , of which upwards of 4250 were bulgarian . 
  considering schools were on voluntary basis , not organized by the state but by the people of each region , it is a telling number for the people that lived there . 
  one of bulgaria 's more famous historians bozidar dimitrov loves to joke that macedonian `` historians '' dread istanbul and its archives , precisely due to the availability of ottoman records on the region and its predominantly bulgarian demographic . 
  i wrote serbs not serbia , considering the serbs first took the region in 1912 and they mainly ruled yugoslavia . 
  i fully understand the two countries are separate and have no ill feelings for modern serbia . 
  yugoslavia invented the `` macedonism '' identity , the idea they are a well defined , separate nation that always called itself macedonian , from the time of alexander , and has in fact been the one to rule medieval byzantium and bulgaria , but those histories were stolen from them . 
  here 's a post i wrote about it a while back with all the links and events i 'm too lazy to write again here : https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3e60jm/when_did_macedonia_become_a_primarily_slavic/ctc9p8x, 
  did someone else take the region and impose 45 years of yugoslav bulgarophobic , `` macedonism '' education on the people , the product of which is their current schizofrenia of ancient greek , medieval serb and modern bulgarian history mixture ?
