  the right-wing junta that greece got in particular . 
  they did n't destroy societies fundamental institutions and functions like ours did , they did n't devastate the country with planned economy . 
  greece today has 10 million people - 3 million more than us , despite the same population 70 years ago . 
  4 times the economy , despite a worse one at the end of ww2 . 
  there is no objective reason for any bulgarian not to prefer their junta , or any capitalist one for that matter , over what happened here . 
  rip . 
  shame we did n't get a right-wing capitalist junta instead of a soviet one . 
  the greeks do n't know how lucky they got during the cold war . 
  yes there is . 
  the molotov-ribentropp pact included a secret protocol for the joint occupation and division of eastern europe . 
  even a [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/mapa_2_paktu_ribbentrop-mo%c5%82otow.gif ) showing exactly how they plan to split poland among themselves , signed by stalin and ribbentrop . 
  that 's what happened and exactly how they split it - according to the plan they had done in august . 
  ** edit ** this person claimed ther was absolutely no common plan , cooperation or plot between germany and the ussr to invade poland , but has now deleted this part of his comment and replaced it with the last paragraph and accusation of right wing propaganda . 
  that 's why i form my answer like that above . 
  interesting , i have actually heard a ton of greek speech here in recent years , but almost always from young people so i thought it was some strange wave of students coming here . 
  ahahahaa , that 's the most peasantish of `` traditions '' among a sub-culture in bulgaria that is dominant - listening to the pop-folk type music you heard there , going to super kitch places full of plastic bitches and dumb chavs . 
  :d it 's a joke around here , like our version of `` jersey shore '' or the english chav culture . 
  there is no chance my city , sofia , is above athens . 
  that 's ridiculous . 
  i barely see any tourists here , it 's not a popular destination at all , whereas athens ... 
  there must be a glitch in the statistics or something . 
  why are you being so abrasive and emotional ? 
  i asked a simple question - why are you jumping to conclusions about him , and you ended up doing the exact same thing about me . 
  your case that you had your reasons to call him a nazi might have been stronger had you not suddenly called me a nazi with just as little a reason other than not liking what i 'm asking you . 
  kind proving it 's a reflex at this point for communists to call their opponents nazis . 
  the word has pretty much lost any meaning to you , just llike all russian nationalists call their critics `` fascists '' , even though they themselves are much closer to that . 
  for me trigger you that way i must ' v written something your communist side truly despises , i just wonder if it is the notion that not all nationalists are nazis , or that your reasoning is equal to saying all leftists are stalinists . 
  i know both of these notions trigger the usual communist , so it might be both . 
  i mean no offence , but i trust you might be lying . 
  i found no such admitance to being a nazi in his comment history prior to your accusation . 
  you did , however , identify as a communist so i reserve the right to find it more likely you adhere to the common delusion among communists that all who are nationalist , right wing or support the nationalists in the spanish civil war are automatically `` nazis '' . 
  similar to one calling all socialists or left-wingers `` stalinists '' . 
  how do you know he 's a nazi ? 
  did n't the nationalist forces in the war consists of a small minority of nazis , and a large majority of regular right-wingers , nationalists , conservatives , reactionaries and monarchists ? 
  considering he 's polish , i doubt he classifies as a nazi , much more likely a conservative/nationalist , as is most of polish society . 
  furthermore , equating everyone who supports the nationalists with nazis makes as much sense as calling everyone on the other side a `` stalinist '' or an anarchist . 
  leave it to those backstabbers to spread bulgarian hate . 
  thank you very much for paying for the new yacht of [ this guy ] ( http://img.bg.sof.cmestatic.com/media/images/640x360/apr2015/2110396926.jpg ) . 
  demand you politicians start keeping track where the money they take from your pocket and send to eastern europe as recompensation for the common market , end up . 
  unlike you i know exactly what [ these people ] ( http://bez-cenzura.com/media/k2/items/cache/1a1c7a0ba8794f499343f3710b15a9ab_xl.jpg ) do with the money that is paid to them from my own pocket , and i want this theft to end immediately . 
  then it is the roma 's fault . 
  a society should n't need investment from a government to develop or progress . 
  if it does , then there 's a cultural problem within that group . 
  it is entirely the fault of the roma they are poor , steming from one reason only - they are uneducated and compete only for the lowest paid jobs . 
  why are they uneducated ? 
  the government already provides them with the opportunity for entirely free education . 
  they are because they do n't value education and often do n't care if their children go to school or how they conduct there . 
  the day the roma start valuing educating their children is when their progress will start without a dime of gov. 
  investment other than in their free education . 
  ( which arleady happens ) nor should the government invest our money in any other way into their communities . 
  if they are unwilling to lift themselves from poverty , they might as well stay in it . 
  my father came to the country i was born as an immigrant with nothing . 
  nothing at all . 
  not even the language . 
  he operates two companies now , iwthout a single cent of this government investing in him . 
  yet hundreds of thousands of locals , who speak the language and get free education ca n't lift themsleves from poverty and need other peoples ' taxes to do that for them ? 
  you mean the coffers filled by the ~ 18 million orthodox christians in romania who will use it ? 
  you do understand that `` the state '' does n't really have money - it uses those of its people , who in this case are a society of overwhelmingly orthodox christians . 
  and the roma are the least contributing to the taxes , on the contrary , they cost the state more then they contribute . 
  why should a cent of my money go towards them instead of something for me ? 
  like a pretty cathedral i would love to have in my otherwise grey , post-socialist city . 
  maybe it will serve the 15-16 million orthodox christians in romania now ? 
  do n't buy a dog when living in athens then . 
  no one 's meant to take care of you dog 's piss . 
   because the private sector does n't have those issues ? 
   the private sector is n't mandatory , so if an organisation is corrupt and wasteful you can never give it a cent again and go to another one that runs better . 
  that 's the point i am making - the private solution is always better because it does n't use violence to monoplize your choice and then never change . 
  the private sector has competition and because of that every organisation within it * must * constantly strive to be as efficient and provide as good a service as possible , or else you just go give your money elsewhere . 
  public organisations do n't have that necessity - they rely on state violence to take money from you and give it to them , then they know they have a monopoly on the service you need so they do n't care how good of a service they provide ( you ca n't go to another org . ), 
  or how efficient/wasteful they are ( they will get the money through your tax anyway ) . 
  hence why defending the public sector funded thorugh mandatory high taxes equals defending wastefulness and innefficiency deriving from the mandatory nature of paying taxes and having no other choice/options in a non-competitive sector . 
   welcome to democracy , they are here because of you . 
  you are either joking or being naive . 
  you have close to zero choice where your money goes or what the govnmt does with it . 
  you have * absolutely * zero choice how much is wasted through corruption and inefficiency , because the public monopoly does n't give you the option to opt out for a more efficient/better organisation for any particular service it provides , the way that the private sector does . 
  to put it simply : when a private organisations wastes your money and provides a poor service you can simply go to another one . 
  this choice forces them all to improve . 
  when a public org does that - you do n't have the choice to stop paying it or go elsewhere . 
  this is both immoral coercion , and a source of stagnation/non-improvement . 
   anyway , we have different opinions . 
  i think all human life matters , that everyone deserves to live well , to be healthy and to have an education . 
  i think we absolutely have the same opinions . 
  i subscribe 100 % to these things you wrote . 
  i just do n't comprehend why you think state burreaucracies are the way to achieve these things , when we have seen again and again the extreme wastefulnness and corruption of public-ran organisations . 
  we know for a fact how innefficient an organisation runs when it is tax-funded instead of private . 
  we all know how little state-workers give a damn for the people they serve when they are n't customers that can go to another organisation and lose you revenue . 
  we know exactly how little is done to improve a state-run and tax-funded organisation because it does n't lose any of its `` revenue '' by holding a monopoly , even if it runs poorly , unlike a private company which has to compete for the best and most efficient service with others . 
  we know exactly how many bad decisions are made by politicians and ministers that squander our money on unnecessary bullshit instead on the people that need them . 
  so the question is - why do people like you still blindly believe these horribly broken , wasteful and corrupt public burreaucracies would ** ever ** be more efficient than private organiations where we , the people who pay in the first place , can decide for ourselves exactly where our money goes , so that i can put my wealth directly to good use for society instead of see it slip through the cracks of public corruption and inneficiency ? 
  see - you feel your money is n't spent well here and yet you have no say , no right to what happens to your own money . 
  someone is just taking it from you , under the threat of violence , not asking you jack shit , and then decides to send it over to bulgaria , where it ends up in the pockets of a small number of already wealthy oligarchs and corrupt politicians . 
  you are literary paying right now for the yacht of [ this guy ] ( http://img.bg.sof.cmestatic.com/media/images/640x360/apr2015/2110396926.jpg ) and ca n't do anything to stop it , because a bunch of armed people will use violence against you if you stop paying them . 
  this does n't sound like theft and extortion to you ? 
  if redistribution is not voluntary then you are forcing someone to give you part of his wealth against his will under the threat of violence - the absolute text book definition of theft . 
  i do n't understand why you have to be `` quite the individualist '' to oppose theft . 
  i thought it was a basic human instinct . 
  do you mind if i point a gun at you and tell you to give me half your shit or i will shoot ? 
  i promise i will `` redistribute '' it how i see fit . 
  that is wonderful . 
  you do that .
