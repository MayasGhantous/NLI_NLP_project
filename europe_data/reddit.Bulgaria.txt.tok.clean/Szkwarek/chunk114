  all i am arguing is for you not to steal my own stuff because you want to give them to someone else . 
  that is theft by every human definition since the beginning of time , and i know of no society through human history that has not defined theft as a crime . 
  you are free to try to * convince * more people to ** freely ** give away their wealth to fund whatever projects you like . 
  you ca n't force them to do that through violence . 
  you limit yourself to thinking stealing is ok . 
  someone else thinks murder is . 
  ( islamists ) someone else still might agree with rape , or slavery or something else . 
  i do n't care which violation of my basic human rights any of you think is ok , as long as you do n't try to act upon it . 
  then i have the right to defend myself from your aggressive actions . 
  you are free to do that if you are ready to fund it with your own money only . 
  you are not free to steal mine through high taxes if i prefer going private , that 's all i am saying . 
  people should have a choice what happens with their wealth and which way they choose - private or public , not have a large , expensive state apparatus forced upon them through the barrel of a gun . 
  ( which is what power in effect is ), 
  fair enough , what do i use for the type of leftist/liberal/progressive who is best described as a `` rootless internationalist '' - i.e. 
  a cultural relativist who feels no connection to his people or any ethnic , national , racial , religious or cultural group , and as such is either apathetic or opposed to any efforts by such groups ? 
  can tax-funded institutions stop giving `` free '' ( it 's not free ) stuff already ? 
  can we get over this statist , wasteful mentality of a `` fatherly '' burreaucracy deciding what to do with our money ? 
  borders , army , police , judiciary , intelligence/security , very basic healthcare , very basic education and a few more to the state . 
  all else private . 
  i can choose where my money goes far better than an apathetic , incompetent or corrupt burreaucrat . 
  and i choose to buy my own ticket * when * i decide to travel , from * whichever * company i decide to travel with - not have it paid for by other people 's taxes because i happen to be within a particular age like a kid getting bought presents . 
  that 's the first time i hear this term , and have neither anti-semitic or stalinist views , but if the term actually makes sense to me regarding plenty of people on the left , why ca n't i use it without being a stalinist anti-semite ? 
  or what can i replace it with . 
  after all , plenty socialists * are * openly and proudly `` rootless internationalists '' ? 
  this sounds like the most eastern european thing i ' v read in my life .

  which is the :  blind , unprovable belief about the existance or not of a supernatural being . 
  in the same category as the blind , unprovable belief that a god exists . 
  only agnosticism is out of the `` faith/belief '' game . 
  no , but when it starts acumulating the traits of a religion and a religious community , it could slowly become one . 
  i think the atheism of voltaire was n't a religion . 
  the atheism of hitchins certainly begins to resemble one . 
  the community of the more outspoken atheists are quite religious and often bigotted in their belief . 
  because it is the blind , unprovable belief about the existance or not of a supernatural being . 
  agnosticism is what counts as `` not a belief '' . 
  georgia and armenia are bastions of some of the most ancient cultures and civilizations , as well as some of the first christians , surrounded by muslim nations that have reduced them to tiny countries . 
  then the ussr fucked them even worse . 
  i sincerely wish them all the best . 
  is a belief though or a reality ? 
  all census available shows argentina actually * is * far , far whiter and `` european '' by ancestry than the rest of america ? 
  i fully know the `` argentina is white '' meme and how it pisses them off , but is n't it actually correct and not just a belief of their far right ? 
  it 's not white enough . 
  all of the americas are more `` european '' than turkey . 
  except argentina of course . 
  how come no one watches ballet or opera in turkey ? 
  is n't that part of international culture now ? 
  like classical music ? 
   how do you call attacking another country ? 
  many things . 
  could be a communist , like the ussr . 
  could be a democrat , like the us . 
  could be a regular aggressor like serbia was in 1885 . 
  you certainly do n't call them nazis just because they attack . 
  to be a nazi country it requires a totalitarian one-party system formed around the principles of national socialism . 
  show me when this occured in bulgaria . 
   and bulgaria was the country that virtualy anihalated the jews in macedonia . 
  nope , the third reich demanded the deportation of all jews in the balkans . 
  bulgaria refused to handle over its jews and saved them all . 
  but it had no jurisdiction over macedonia , which was not incorporated into the territory of bulgaria but put under a `` temporary occupation zone '' , like the general government in poland for example , hence it had no say there . 
  or are you going to explain to me how a country risks everything defying the third reich to save its jewish population , but then it eagerly kills the jews in another place ? 
  makes no sense , but then again most of macedonian lies do n't . 
   `` my grandpa was not a colaborator '' version . 
  you ca n't collaborate with your own people . 
  you just join them when they liberate the place you live . 
  lol , sure kid , that 's how history works . 
  and the british being allied to the soviets means were the british ** nazi ** army , right ? 
  :d try actually reading history as opposed to your yugo era textbooks - bulgaira was at no point a national socialist totalitarian system . 
  it was an authoritarian democracy like most of europe at the time . 
  it had not a single faucet of nazi society . 
  it did n't open concentration camps , did n't have ghettos or persecute people based on their ethnicity - on the opposite , bulgaria [ was the only axis country to save its jews ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-bulgaria-saved-its-jews-from-nazi-concentration-camps/2013/05/08/e866bdda-8cb1-11e2-9838-d62f083ba93f_story.html ) . 
  wow , nazis who love and save their jews . 
  whereas the claim that there was a 110,000 strong partisan army in macedonia i will not even honour with an answer . 
  it 's on the same level of `` alexander was a slav macedonian '' claim . 
  pathetic . 
  i ' v more than once told myself it is pointless to argue with people who think the earth is flat , it 's such a trivial , basic lack of knowledge on the subject that drives them to believe it that it honestly is just a waste of time . 
  arguing with people who have never in their life opened a book on christian dogma , on chrisitanity 's history or as much as even read the wiki article , but spew the idiotic popular myths such as that the old testament and parts like leviticus are part of christianity 's teaching and core dogma , are no different than the flat-earthers . 
  they are fundamentally and ideologically driven to repeat that factual bullshit without ever having checked themselves . 
  the catholic dogma of all things is so well preserved over the centuries , so well codified ( precisely thanks to the existance of the church ) , that you can literary never have any doubt exactly which teachings and which messages are part of it , whichever century you live in . 
  you have had 2000 years to inform yourself that no - killing anyone for any reason is forbidded 100 % in christianity , no - old testament tales of slaves or burning people * are n't * in any shape or form part of chrisitantiy 's teaching etc. 
  it 's very , very funny a person like you will say christianity condone 's stoning of women , when one of the most famous acts of the cretor of the religion - jesus christ , was to ** stop ** the stoning of an adulteres woman ( a prostitute in fact ) , and tell the people `` let the one without a sin throw the first stone '' - which is a core tenant in christianity . 
  yet you are so lacking in basic education on the subject that even this famous part of the christian bible you have n't ever heard . 
  so tell me , advice me please , how do i even begin explaining a flat-earther that the earth is actually round ? 
  where do you start , when he lacks even the basic 1st grader level knowledge on the subject and repeats completely made up things ? 
  elaborate and complete response . 
  thank you . 
  you are wrong though , at [ least according to the eu commission ] ( http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/csgr/green/foresight/demography/2007_ec_europes_demographic_future_facts_and_figures_on_challenges_and_opportunities.pdf ) . 
  in short : - muslims a third of european population by 2100 - non-indigenous , non-european ethnicities and racial groups a quarter of the population by 2100 - demographic collapse of the indigenous population as fertility rates remain constant at an average ( ~ 1.6 ) far below replacement rate . 
  [ as africa 's population quadruples ] ( http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/09/africas-population-will-quadruple-by-2100-what-does-that-mean-for-its-cities/380507/ ) to 4 billion people by 2100 , an open door policy of europe means millions of immigrants unnacounted for in the above mentioned ec predictions , and significantly increase those . 
  i am completely honest when i ask you what i wrote was a nazi rethoric . 
  i do n't try to have a fight with you , i 'm not a troll . 
  you made a statement , whith which i strongly disagree as i identify as a classical liberal , so i 'd love for you to elaborate . 
  do you disagree there is a tendency in europe for demographic replacement of the indigenous population ? 
  it would be anything but nice to ~ 2 billion catholics around the world if their church forgot its purpose ( to represent christianity ) and decided to play modern politics for the sake of appeasing a 21st century ideological narrativ . 
  from opposing same sex marriage to the complete or partial replacement of millenia of european culture and civilization with mid-eastern/islamic one , i think , stands * a lot * of distance . 
  and excuse me if i 'd prefer the lesser ( much , much lesser ) of those two evils . 
  i am forced to , when `` the progressives '' would see nothing wrong with the demographic replacement that is occurring . 
  what ? 
  did you seriously use a quote from ahmed dogan talking about the national interrest ot say there is not as much corruption ? 
  is that supposed to be a joke ?
