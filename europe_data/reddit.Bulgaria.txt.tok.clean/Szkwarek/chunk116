  how did she make them needlessly suffer ? 
  nice b8 m8, 
  that game is the best thing my country has given the world i quite some time . 
  is this meant to be a condemnation ? 
  i proudly support a whole number of nazi policies , and there 's nothing wrong with others on this sub doing the same . 
  policies like those they pioneered in environment , anti-smoking , public healthcare , sport , child care and maternity ( especially helping single mothers ) , etc. 
  or do you mean some other policies ? 
  like you actually think people in this sub want to open gas chambers or conduct human experiments and live vivisections ? 
  the serbs began a process of de-bulgarisation immediately after 1912 . 
  what the communists did began only in 1944 , with the creation of the `` macedonian language '' in the st. prohor p\u010dinjski monastery , officially by the `` anti-fascist assembly for the national liberation of macedonia '' , in reality by the comintern and aided by the newly established regime in bulgaria , who sent linguists . 
  here 's a very extensive doccumentary of all this , with interviews of the actual people who lived through it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ek-th9ia4w, 
   would a bulgarian fight against his fellow men no he would n't . 
  lol what ? 
  of course he would - and they did . 
  the bulgarian army was fought by communist partisans in bulgaria , same as in macedonia . 
  were therefore the bulgarian communists who fought our axis-aligned regime actually doing it because they are n't bulgarians ? 
  were the french who fought the vichy regime doing it because they did n't feel french ? 
  or the germans who attempted to assassinate hitler not german ? 
  it was a time of opposing ideologies and many states had internal conflicts . 
  in macedonia precisely the same communist partisans fought as did so in bulgaria , whereas regular bulgarians , like my great-grandfather from ohrid , wellcomed the unification . 
  your argument above just showcases once more the level of yugoslav indoctrination - they have thought you to embrace the actions of a bunch of marxist terrorists as `` a national struggle against occupation '' - which is actually the exact same thing our communist regime was doing for 45 years , but unlike you , we actually know they were full of shit and look at the communist terrorists here in bulgaria in ww2 as nothing but that . 
  who is `` we '' ?

  you ancestors were macedonian bulgarians from ohrid or prilep like goce delchev , vapcarov or todor alexandrov , who all identified fully the macedonian slavs with the bulgairan nation and fought for this . 
  your separate `` nationality '' is very well documented product of the comintern and yugoslavia . 
  i think the original story was that they made the statues naked , but then some people protested and they had to literary cover them up with these extra `` cloths '' . 
  no kidding , reading about macedonism is like a comedy routine . 
  difference being that none of the maps i posted have any connection to bulgaria whatsoever , hence where is the agenda ? 
  how does suddenly all of europe have a pro-bulgarian agenda ? 
  from english ethnographers , to the ottoman archives , to german or italian historians and even american anthropologists who travelled the region ? 
  some giant pro-bulgairan conspiracy has been going on it seems at the time , despite bulgaria being at odds geo-politically with many of those same countries . 
  there 's a much simpler explanation - the slavs in macedonia at the time identified overwhelmingly as bulgarian first , `` macedonian bulgarians '' second . 
  the literary standard for macedonian was made by bulgarian linguists brought to a monastery in southern serbia in 1944-1945 by the communists with the explicit purpose of creating a separate language out of this bulgarian dialect . 
  there is no macedonian literature or books before that time , whereas some of bulgaria 's greatest poets and writers come from macedonia . 
  correct . 
  the openly bulgarophobic position and policies of the ex-yugoslav political nomenlacture are in full effect . 
  they understand that creating a throrough `` macedonian '' identity is the only way to perpetuate their power in a state that should n't exist . 
  moldovenism seems pretty close to the macedonisation they carried out in our western region . 
  only difference is they started out much earlier - after the serbs got the region in 1912 , thus allowing for a more thorough and complete `` de-bulgarisation '' . 
  today almost no one identifies as bulgarian , whereas 100 years ago ethnographers from all over europe routinely showed it to be one of the * most * bulgarian regions of all : [ french ] ( https://jaddeyekabir.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/balkans-ethnic_1861.jpg ) [ english ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/ernst-ravenstein-balkans-ethnic-map-1880.jpg ) [ german ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/bulgarians_in_1912.jpg ) [ austrian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/ethnic_map_of_balkans_-_german_1882.jpg ) [ russian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/ethnic_map_of_balkans_-_russian_1867.jpg ) [ german consul in adrianople , using ottoman census ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/ethnographic_map_of_european_turkey_from_1877_by_carl_sax.jpg ) [ american ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/distribution_of_races_on_the_balkans_in_1922_hammond.png ) [ belgian ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_765kg51rvbe/s9njkekv9ci/aaaaaaaaaig/h83pev-1tt4/s1600/dr_map_24.jpg ) [ german again ] ( http://kroraina.com/makedonija/karti/ethno/volkerkartevonmittel-undsudosteuropa.jpg ) [ swiss german ] ( https://www2.bc.edu/~heineman/maps/ethnic.jpg ), 
  if it was n't for yugoslavia and the comintern , `` macedonians '' would be saying the same about bulgaria . 
  instead , 75 years of brainwashing [ results in this ] ( http://www.70-130.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/golden-statues-and-eternal-flame-monument-in-skopje.jpg ) . 
   i do n't deny the importance of communism for the poor state of economy in which the ee is now . 
  what i find wrong is that ou were speaking of `` historically '' wealther without setting a time period . 
  like if ee was entitled to prosperity now because they were wealthier at a time of history . 
  not at all do i claim ee is entitled to anything . 
  i was giving the context of historically wealthier nations that got poorer directly as result of communism to prove that point - that communism is the chief and only reason why , say , czechia - 2 times richer than spain , ended up 5 times poorer just 50 years later . 
   and there can have explanation to why spain ( spanish civil war ) or greece ( coup and war with turkey before that ) were poor in 1938 but it seems like explanations applies only to ex-communists countries . 
  same applies to those countries i showed you - poland had war with the ussr and massive destruction of ww1 , yet was richer than spain and greece in 1939 . 
  45 years later - 4 to 5 times poorer all of a sudden . 
  direct reason - communist collapse . 
  simple as that . 
  i am giving explanations , not justifications for something or making a point . 
   you think that if poland was strong enough to resist , germany would have failed in the case of the polish army had lost ? 
  100 % yes . 
  read about post ww1 germany - in 1920-21 it was completely disarmed , in absolute dissaray , bankrupt and in a total political mess . 
  poland on the other hand quickly organized an almost 1 million strong army , well equipped , well trained and led by a very united nation under strong political leadership . 
  poland was many times more capable of defending itself than germany was in 1921 , so yes - without poland there germany would have been overtaken by the red army and no entente countries , totally exhausted by the war , would go sacrafice hundreds of thousands to liberate their bitter recent enemy . 
  speculate all you want from here about the future of europe if there was a communist soviet aligned germany in 1921 . 
  i do n't think it bodes well . 
   we had our own wars against nazism and communism , stop making it sounds like if we was impotent of what happened and that only ee sacrifice made it possible to not become communist or nazist . 
  i did n't deny that , but the fact that the red army was unstoppable in 1944 is undisputable . 
  it would have overrun anything in its path and the only reason it did n't overrun you is because you were far enough from it to have the americans get there first and secure a free-market economy for your future as opposed to a marxist collapse . 
  ee being there to extend the march of the red army is why brussels was n't `` liberated '' by stalin . 
   btw it was n't what i discussed at the beginning , what i find wrong is to blame we for ee misery and communism never did that . 
  the red army is why ee was condemned to communism and therefore misery . 
  germany has a role to play in this as well however , carving up ee with moscow in 1939-40 , resulting in all of the above . 
  i thank we for a lot of things . 
   last time i checked it was national politicans supported by urss that set communist states in ee . 
  no , it was 100 % the red army which occupied militarily the states and picked who will now be their puppet in each country . 
  in bulgaria for example there were so few communists they had to bring over some of our communist immigrants across europe like georgi dimitrov . 
   put your house in order before blaming other . 
  exactly what we ' v been doing , and every time it happens we get invaded from west , south or east and have to start over again . 
  the ottoman empire occupation =  stagnation =  the empire collapses and 5 decades of prosperity follow as we develop on par with the west in free countries . 
  the german and austrian empires invade =  stagnation =  they collapse and 2 decades of prosperity and development come to ee . 
  the ussr and third reich invade =  genocide and destruction , then marxist stagnation =  the ussr collapses and now again 25 years of prosperity as we put our own houses in order . 
  if we were left alone for the past 200 years like the scandinavian states or belgium , which had like 8 or 9 years of foreign occupation in total , you can be sure we would n't be having this concersation . 
   i can also choose which part of history is relevant and say that greece and spain were wealthier than bohemia , hungary or poland . 
  i am not choosing `` whichever part of history suits me '' - i point you the direct current history of the past 70 years where communism and its collapse are the direct reason as to why the e exact certain number of countries [ fell into nothing in 90s and behind other countries they have historically before that always been ahead of .

  [ poland first did it in 1921 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93soviet_war ) then in 1944 the very existance of eastern europe was a barrier for the red army to bring the communist destruction to you before the americans reached you instead . 
  you 'd be no better off today than slovakia had they reached you . 
  it covers the vast , vast majority of europe so it 's perfectly convenient . 
  no one is going to inconvenience himself or everyone reading this just to spare the potential butthurt of whatever tiny minority of countries are n't present . 
  get over it , the world does n't revolve around you . 
  for 1000 years spain , portugal , greece , ireland and finland were all poorer than bohemia-moravia , or for the most part hungary , and at times from poland . 
  greece was as poor as bulgaria and serbia in 1944 . 
  [ 45 years of planned economy under the kremlin and for the first time in a millenium the czechs are poorer than the irish , finish or portoguese . 
  the greeks from poorer than the serbs and bulgarians suddenly are 4 times richer . 
  ] ( https://s4.postimg.org/v0mh48nrx/1660711_10209118438827848_8887755968067137605_n.jpg ) you do n't need to go that far back . 
  the complete economic , demographic and societal destruction that resulted from the collapse of the communist societies imposed on eastern europe is the direct result why they lag behind a lot of regions that have historically always been poorer or on par with them , including iberia - historically more rural and poor than bohemia or hungary . 
  communism is why countries in central and eastern europe that were historically richer than say greece or spain ( bohemia , hungary , poland ) are now poorer . 
  as you 'd be if eastern europe was n't there between you and the red army .
