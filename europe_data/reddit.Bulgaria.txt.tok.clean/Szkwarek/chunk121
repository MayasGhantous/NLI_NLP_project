  your rationale is that of a conqueror/imperialist . 
  we do n't * need * to take something they have . 
  we need to * reunite * our country and nation divided by the serbo-yugoslav nation-creation experiment . 
  all of your ancestors , all of them , are rolling in their graves from the existance of this made up nation stealing our history and brainwashing our former bulgarian co-nationals . 
  increasing the german defence budget from 1.29 % to 2 % means a transfer of massive ammounts of money . 
  they have to come from somewhere so regardless if they would cut the healthcare and education , or say their eco subsidies and infrastructural projects , they would have to cut * something * that they can currently enjoy thanks to the us footing the bill on nato . 
  so my point stands - it 's not europe that is a `` slave '' of the us if the us provides europe with a free service that innevitably benefits it rather than exploit it like happens with a slave . 
  i 'd love to see bullfighting if it actually * was * bullfighting or a sport . 
  as in - one healthy bull , one man with whatever cold-steel weapon and armour he wants , one arena . 
  they actually fight to the death , if the bull wins he gets comfy life somwhere until natural death . 
  if the bullfighter does , he gets a ton of money and goes up in the ranking . 
  there will be a rank list , bets , even teams . 
  proper sport . 
  not the current , boring as fuck , cruel and unfair ritual slaughter of a weak and confused bull by a whole bunch of guys over a long period of time , with zero chance of the bull winning or any excitment , competition or anything that would actually classify it as a sport . 
  our golgotha . 
  a slave provides you with stuff/services for free whilst you just enjoy it . 
  like the us does with their military to europe whilst we spend meager ~ 1.4 % of gdps on the armies and instead brag about our free healthcare and education . 
  considering the huge fuss it made here that they are `` taking money from pensioners to comply with nato `` dictate '' when rich countries like germany barely spend anything '' - i am pretty sure they did , to some extend at least . 
  still my point stands - eastern europe spends far more of their gdps than western , with few exceptions like the uk . 
  so it 's obvious the arrogant dude up there was whining against e.europe merely as an excuse for not wanting it in nato to begin with , because if he really cared that much about expenditure , it 's states like germany he should be most angry at . 
  not really , it needs a clerical body in control to be that , like iran 's guardian council . 
  turkey is moving more towards pure , simple old authoritarianism through the usual route of a dictator supported by a large mass of populists and reactionaries . 
  old data , bulgaria 's [ new programming period for the military from 2014 ] ( http://www.investor.bg/biudjet-i-finansi/333/a/razhodite-za-otbrana-dostigat-2-ot-bvp-do-2016-g-181060/ ) introduced an increase to 2 % by the start of 2016 and planned 2.4 % by 2020 . 
  meanwhile , germany is spending 1.29 % despite being the absolute strongest , healthiest economy in the eu with a huge surplus . 
  basically the poorest in nato pay their fair share and the richest do n't . 
  a bit like in society . 
  at the same time , the bulgars are recorded by byzantine chronicles as the second largest tribe inside the hunnic confederation and the tribe that led the remaining horde back east when attila died , yet we neither use the name attila , nor does anyone associate us with them . 
  perception of history is strange , really . 
  you mean albania , right ? 
  shiptars will be the majority in fyrom long before all bulgarians are gone . 
  whereas we ca n't even count how many times more politicians you have in prison , because our 0 ca n't be multiplied by any number to reach your hundreds . 
  it 's the one where glorious defenders of europe strike back at the invaders and retake the heartland of christianity that was ripped out by the aggressor . 
  so does estonia ( 2 % ) , bulgaria ( 2 % ) , romania ( 2.1 % ) and poland ( 2.2 % ) , whilst lithuania and latvia will reach the 2 % by 2020 . 
  your entire premise in this comment section that e.europe does n't `` deserve '' to be in nato because it does n't pay its share is simply the product of your lack of information mixed with arrogance . 
  in reality , western europe is where the countries with the lowest military expenditure as % of gdp in the entire world are concentrated . 
  they are the proper nato free-loaders , yet you whine about eastern europe . 
  it 's a tad bit dishonest to make up arguments like these rather than just admit your personal bias towards that part of the continent which is the real reason to not want them in nato , not made critera about spending that would actually first kick western europe from the alliance , not eastern . 
  macedonia , here we come again !, 
  naaah , i just think you did n't realize that many countries in europe sounded like that before people started pointing it out to you . 
   it 's ok to be wrong dude , chill . 
  so , pretty much all of europe ? 
  in english : austria , latvia , estonia , russia , croatia , slovenia , slovakia , bulgaria , romania , serbia . 
  in latin and slavic languages : germania , anglia , italia , francia , dania , norvegia , svecia , hollandia , belgia , ispania , portugalia , polonia , hungaria , czechia , finlandia , grecia , turcia , irlandia ...

  dude , you have to be joking if you think any sort of ideology is what makes gerb successful . 
  it 's boko 's personality cult ( fitting for the level of the average bulgarian ) plus the wealth and power of the bulgarian oligarchy and mafia behind him . 
  no one gives two fucks what gerb stands for , it is a completely devout of ideology or political leanings party . 
  boko himself makes zero actual strong stances on either russia or europe . 
  it 's a hollow political project that operates like a business . 
  inside it you have hard-line communist nomenclature people like cecka cacheva or cvetanov on high ranking positions , plus hard-line europeans like andrey kovachev . 
  it 's a circus of all ideologies and parties , merely in power through populism and the strong corporation-like model of the party . 
  outside of it , the actual ideology-driven parties on the other hand are as follows : pro-kremlin ones : bsp - 14 % dps - 14 % ataka - 8 % abv - 4 % pro-western ones : reformators - 10 % that 's it . 
  the russophilic vote gets you far more than the liberal or pro-western one . 
  and combining both in the most neutral , populist manner like gerb does gets you the most . 
  i think the opposite - russophilia used to be contained with the left , bsp and old soviet nostalgics . 
  then , however , in the past few years with putin 's hybrid warfare and turn to the far right , it transfered onto the nationalists and populists . 
  10 years ago i communicated a lot with young nationalists , fascists and neo-nazis - they all hated russia for being previously communist and slavic . 
  ( untermensch to them ) today - they all love it for the social stance of putin and being supposedly `` against the jews , west , bankers and nwo '' . 
  so russophilia exploded by becoming not just a vestage of the old soviet generation , but a political force of all who are part of the `` anti-globalist '' movement , all who are anti-vaccers , who believe in chem trails , haarp , nwo , who talk of bilderberg , rothchilds , zionists , who hate capitalism , the west , the banks , and all who are hard-line racists . 
  basically russophilia dominates the lower 50 - maybe even 60 % of the social spectrum in terms of education and earnings . 
  the populist masses who look at the west as decadent , capitalist and decaying . 
  what makes you think bulgaria has a `` great '' relationship with turkey ? 
  the country is divided ideologically and politically in a very harsh 50/50 between russophilic/soviet nostalgics who hate turkey out of nationalism and the current moscow-ankara split , and the other 50 % are pro-eu , pro-western liberals who hate turkey for being authoritarian , leaning islamist , and also mildly out of nationalism . 
  i see no support for turkey here . 
  maybe they come to our ports so we can double the fleet ? 
  `` one bird does n't make spring '' :d 99,999 % of what the communists build is disgusting in its style and idea . 
  no , i am not a photographer , just found it one net and wanted to share , i believe the source is on the far left corner if you 'd like to check out more of their work . 
  to me it kinda looks like a giant bunker . 
  something about the simple , sturdy , massive round flat-top shape . 
  even if not disgusting as most commie buildings , i 'd definitely not call it beautiful . 
  well here it 's the opposite , we have a very strong `` going to the park '' culture . 
  the only reason sofia has so many large parks is because they planned for already at the start of the 20th century . 
  we have two very , very large parks in the centre and a ton of small ones like the one on the pic . 
  one good thing the communists did was they at least preserved them and did n't build them up , like they did with the rest of the city . 
  on this map you can find the above thread picture showed in the very centre with a little black icon . 
  see how tiny the park showed in the pic is compared to the large green spots on the city : http://www.orangesmile.com/common/img_city_maps/sofia-map-0.jpg, 
  yeah , there 's no denying communist architecture was horrible . 
  but they kinda try make it look nice [ with lights and fountains ] ( http://www.vsekiden.com/uploads/2015/11/14/8b5e678f37c809a41a6501ef7ee22048.jpg ) . 
  the park in front of it looks quite good at the moment ( original thread pic is the back ) : https://s31.postimg.org/nn174dauj/13100731_1746595185598846_6294999301868736743_n.jpg https://s31.postimg.org/lo8hcmn3f/12670926_1002694299817079_562193151448335407_n.jpg, 
  yes it is a minority , but the majority is n't entirely made of `` communist monstrosity '' - the past 25 years have experienced a huge building boom and the city is filled with modern business centers and entire neigbourhoods . 
  everything around the southern ring-road , along bul . 
  bulgaria and much of mladost begins to look like that : http://www.businesspark-sofia.com/uploads/backgrounds/1.jpg http://www.businesspark-sofia.com/uploads/backgrounds/3.jpg, 
  the preserved old parts in the center are very beautiful actually . 
  to be fair , pictured is our version of your `` communist monstrosity '' - the `` palace of culture '' , so definitely not the prettiest of sights in sofia , but i liked the lights . 
  an entire 30 % , a 1/3 of our nation , outright wants us to immediately leave the eu and nato and join the eurasian union . 
  that 's not `` regular likeness of russia '' , that 's last-stage political putinism , and it is expressed by every third bulgarian for christ ' sake . 
  that 's collosal - forgive my godwin 's , but hitler came to power with 32 % of the * voters * . 
  the more mild pro-kremlin people do n't want us to outright join the eurasian union , but that we stay in europe as a sort of `` troyan horse '' - sponge off of their funds but generally aid russia . 
  and this is expressed by 61 % of the people who opposed the eu-wide sanctions on the eu . 
  so we have 30 % who are hard core putinists and want us to joint the eurasian union , and another 30 % who are `` moderate '' putinists , wanting us to stay in the eu to benefit from it , but be russia 's voice inside of the it as in the case of sanctions . 
  that 's 60 % people who are moderately or hard-core ( even divide 50/50 ) pro-kremlin and hate anyone who talks against russia . 
  this is more than enough grounds to consider bulgarian society to be very , very pro-kremlin in comparisson to the rest of europe , and in this case - to romania , where the above numbers of support are in the single digits . 
  over 30 % were the people who outright said we should leave eu , nato and join the eurasian union . 
  that 's the final stage of pro-kremlin people , it does n't get more russophilic than that , and it applies to an entire 1/3 of the nation . 
  the more mild pro-kremlin people do n't want us to outright join the eurasian union , but that we stay in europe as a sort of `` troyan horse '' - sponge off of their funds but generally aid russia . 
  and this is expressed by 61 % of the people who opposed the eu-wide sanctions on the eu . 
  so we have 30 % who are hard core putinists and want us to joint the eurasian union , and another 30 % who are `` moderate '' putinists , wanting us to stay in the eu to benefit from it , but be russia 's voice inside of the it as in the case of sanctions . 
  that 's 60 % people who are moderately or hard-core ( even divide 50/50 ) pro-kremlin and hate anyone who talks against russia , like our president does . 
  boyko knows very well about that 60 % and does n't want to anger them , hence why he is * always * as mild , vague , balanced and neutral on all things related russia and putin . 
  i live in sofia , on blvd vitosha , right in front of raffy - the most central place in the country , and when i go to the national theatre they have almost routinelly a stand with flags next to fountain , which sells exclusive bulgarian and russian flags .
