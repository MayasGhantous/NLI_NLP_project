  i ' v seen the same all over the country : [ this is a common sight in bulgaria ] ( http://offnews.bg/images/events/2016/02/19/624485/phpxlj45l_559x*.jpg ) and you absolutely know it . 
  stop playing dumb , i am on your side and regret the reality of this society as much , but do n't turn a blind wishfull eye to it . 
  bulgarians who are opposed to kremlin 's policies and putin 's regime are ** very , very ** heavily outnumbered . 
  is [ dnevnik ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/03/16/2492524_vse_poveche_bulgari_sa_negativno_nastroeni_kum_rusiia/ ) also a pro-russia shill ? 
  c'mon man , you are desperately denying the obvious ugly truth about our nation because of personal desires . 
  even without research , just by seeing this country , the russian flags they sell right alongside bulgarian ones everywhere , the attitude of regular people , to know how russophilic the country is . 
  here 's the stats from dnevnik : * after a 30 % drop * due to crimea 's annexation , 54 % of the polulation has kept its russophilia , whilst another 7 % has actually increased it . 
  that 's 61 % of people in bulgaria being russophilic . 
  the above number checks out when on the questions of sanctions on russia , * exactly * 61 % say they are fully against any such . 
  and honestly , if you are from here , is [ seeing things like this ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jchg_atye5s/vehjelymexi/aaaaaaaajwy/st7emmafb8o/s1600/chashi%2b002.jpg ) all your life not something that tips you off as to the attitudes of most bulgarians , especially the less-educated , poorer , older and more country-side ones ? 
  which happen to be the majority , even if we isolate ourselves among pro-eu people from the middle class and lager cities . 
  come to sunny beach here in bulgaria this summer to find out . 
  ogre * girls . 
  he means british girls . 
  yes , the idea of the same kind . 
  only true , as opposed to those others being mostly wrong . 
  other than that little detail , they truly * are * simillar . 
  we do n't have people who wear these things . 
  we do n't want * to * have such people . 
  what 's horrific about this ? 
  we got to the point in time a nation just * has * to accept whetever future brings , and take no action in deciding what or who this future brings ? 
  this is n't the us , we do n't have to be a `` nation of various cultures and religions '' , nor do we want to be one . 
  this isn ' ; t horrific . 
  why would a majority chrisitan nation ban christian crosses ? 
  more than a bodyguard , he was a mobster with ties to the communists in the 90s . 
  had a `` security company '' , which pretty much meant in the 90s that you ran a criminal group . 
  involved in smuggling and `` insurance '' ( read racketeering ) . 
  there 's literary a stereotypical goon running this country . 
  and as you see , bulgaria does n't want them either . 
  gypsies have been paid to do more ludacris things in this country . 
  about 30,000 in the past few years . 
  what used to be a lovely old neighbourhood in the centre of sofia has turned into an arab ghetto . 
  think whatever you want about maggie thatcher , but few people have had such an influence on history as to have their nickname used for practically every single other persona who is slightly like them . 
  ( in her case , a strong female politician ), 
  if there 's one thing balkan people should n't be trusted with on this planet , it 's anything nuclear . 
  i will play devil 's advocate despite not agreeing with him : i believe he meant to say it is n't your nation , hence why you should n't have a say in what the bulgarian nation choses to do geo-politically . 
  i think you are very wrong about most of gerb voters . 
  the vast majority of people in bulgaria are pro-russia , more than half . 
  this includes gerb 's electorate . 
  that 's precisley whay borisov has always levitated between europe and putin in all of his remarks , initiatives and speeches . 
  that 's also why the president has 7 % aproval rating . 
  anyone who is highly anti-putin in bulgaria becomes extremely unpopular due to most of the population being brainwashed russophiles . 
  ** edit ** if fellow bulgarians do not agree with my statement you could say at least which one is wrong - that most gerb elecotrate are russophiles or that most bulgairans are . 
  downvote all you want , just provide a counterargument . 
  crimea is n't in ukraine anymore , i thought you of all people should know that . 
  this dropped the percentage of russian-only speakers in ukraine to barely 19 % . 
  of these , the vast majority identify with ukraine and fight as volunteers in batallions like azov . 
  you wo n't comment on that because you have nothing to say about it . 
  `` so u r not an uneducated turd '' is the epitome of irony . 
  `` i know u gon na argue , which is what all stupid people do '' no , debating a subject is n't `` what stupid people do '' . 
  it 's what you did yourself above , until now you have nothing else to argue with because you realize i am right about the 19 % and azov batallion , so you try to run away from the argument . 
  you sound like a 10 year old . 
  19 % russian speakers = half . 
  most russian speakers have ukrainian identity . 
  the most battle-hardened volunteer batallions are made up of russian speakers . 
  azov batallion is made up of more than 70 % russian speakers from eastern ukraine and they are the most nationalistic in the ukrainian army . 
  you talk without knowing shit . 
  i am all for that . 
  any other questions ? 
  not engaging benefits russia and its increasing habbit of creating frozen conflicts around its borders . 
  engaging benefits long-term peace in europe . 
  nato has business engaging in whatever wars benefit its member nations . 
  as any other military alliance in human history . 
  i 'm not saying how it is , i 'm saying how it should be . 
  normative vs positive . 
  your contribution to this discussion is highly appreciated . 
  move on . 
  all countries are `` the self proclaimed greatest nations in the universe '' ? 
  are you on something right now ? 
  who is that ? 
  people even imagining the possibility that washington or moscow would ever go through with the long , complicated procedure involving many , many people and authorisation to launch an all-out nuclear strike that destroys the entire world , including them , lives in some sort of an alternate reality or has watched too many movies . 
  never will a nuclear holocaust happen . 
  never . 
  not even with a nato army at the very entrance of moscow will the kremlin do it . 
  because there is always , always something more to be lost when you fucking end the world . 
  more than territory , more than even moscow , you literary need the entire ruling elite and military brass to suddenly lose their minds and become suicidal . 
  forget ther families , their lives , their minds and destroy the world because ... what ? 
  there 's a nato army fighting in ukraine ? 
  there 's a nato army bombing inside russian territory ? 
  there 's a fucking nato army at the gates of moscow ? 
  even then they would still have families somwhere they would rather live . 
  no , not even then . 
  never will there , or can there be a nuclear holocaust , reality is n't a kubrik movie . 
  if you country does n't want to participate in the collective security of an alliance primarily located in europe , it can leave that alliance . 
  the concept of defence on the borders of an alliance/country , before the trouble crosses these borders , is n't a new one . 
  i 'd rather nato asserts its dominance by fighting briefly in ukraine against russian soldiers at least posing as separatists , than fightin one day in the baltics against regular russian troops because we were too lenient all those previous times they did that same scenario - transnistria , abkhazia , chechnya , ossetia , crimea , donbas ... 
  the concept of defence on the borders of an alliance/country is new to you ? 
  russia 's been doing it and using it as an excuse for years , including right now in ukraine , but nato ca n't / should n't do it ? 
  how am i doing it ? 
  did i advocate a draft in your country to send soldiers to fight in eastern ukraine ? 
  then do n't volunteer . 
  you overestimate highly the grad or artillery misle systems . 
  as well as the risk kremlin is ready to take for an open war with nato . 
  it 's a dog that barks more than it bites anything that is n't considerably smaller and wearker from it . 
  and nato is n't . 
  if an alliance consists in 95 % or more of european countries , then it ca n't be said that a `` european problem '' is n't a problem of this alliance . 
  more than half of nato 's combined force comes from european countries . 
  ( if we count turkey , in the case of ukraine 's crisis we certainly should ) it 's headquarters are in europe . 
  it 's very purpose of creation and existance was to keep peace in europe . 
  you are basically advocating nato stops existing , which is fine , but at least has to be said openly .
