  what , however , was disproportionate was the ammount of media attention given to cases of paedohpilia in the church and those outside of it . 
  basically , every time there is a priest paedophile it becomes a story , as opposed to quite less whith other professions . 
  hence creating what is more a myth of the `` priest paedohpile '' and a joke , than real correlation . 
  john paul curse you nemci !, 
  true . 
  yet the examples encompass a good dozen countries and a few hundred million people , from pakistan to yemen , to lybia etc. 
  as opposed to how many christian countries with legal paedophilia ? 
  hence i do n't understand the connection christians should have with this phenomenon . 
  the famous asian hive-mind . 
  is n't paedophilia accepted in islam , as opposed to christianity ? 
  are n't they the ones with the perfectly legal child brides all over the muslim world ? 
  no paedophiles among protestants/orthodox ? 
  wait , i always thought texas was the more rational of the `` southern states '' , a more rich , well-to do , kinda nationalistic in its own way place , with strong local culture and the whole `` cowboy thing '' going on . 
  as opposed to the alabama , georgia , south carolina etc. 
  type of `` confederate irredentist '' - baptist dominated , fundamentalist states . 
  am i wrong ? 
  it 's true and all but stop fucking shoving this into every mention of sweden . 
  it 's getting boring , tedious , and frankly weakens any future conversation on this problem by turning it into an annoying meme . 
  the polish commonwealth fell into an internal political decay that made it possible for its corrupt members of the senate to pretty much give away its lands in exchange for money and protection . 
  there was no war where russian armies defeated polish ones and partitioned the land . 
  peterburg merely took advantage of the possibility to take land in peaceful deals with corrup internal officials . 
  the only wars fought between the states of poland and russia happened in the late 16th and throughout the 17th centuries , and then again in the 20th century . 
  poland won most of the wars in the 16th and 17th centuries . 
  and in the 20th century it won 2 wars - the two westard soviet offensives , and lost 1 - the 1939 invasion , althought this was pretty much entirely against germany and no actual battles were fought with the soviet army by the time it invaded . 
  so basically parts of poland have been occupied by russia twice , and both times it was almost entirely the result of the diplomatic collapse of the polish state , not a military victory of russia over the polish armies . 
  when these two met , the resulsts were not very fafouvarble for russia , despite it always having a huge numerical superiority . 
  and your sensitive , progressive heart just ca n't take all that nationalistic gibberish !, 
  quick , leave before they hurt your feelies even more !, 
  and yet they have little to no negative opinion currently of states and peoples who have hurt them equally or more throughout history , like say - germany . 
  might as well ask yourself why is it that only russia seems to keep the fires of hatred up and running . 
  could it be something to do with them experiencing a deja vu when watching russian politics , which they do n't with their other historic enemies ? 
  shots fired !, 
  yeah , the state that killed them by the millions . 
  has n't russia actually lost [ most of its wars against poland ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polish%e2%80%93russian_wars ) ? 
  and mainly won in crushing uprisings as opposed to polish regular armies . 
  then how does it exists if it is literary bad for everyone ? 
  as in , we 're even past the point of saying it 's only good for the `` eurocrats , socialists , liberals and immigrants '' - now we have to believe it 's actually bad for every single group , yet still somehow standing . 
  logic , please try to use it . 
  serbs and russians did that to cut off about 25 % of our nation and stop the irredentist wars we kept fighting to get them back . 
  the `` macedonisation '' of the vardar bulgarians began in 1944 by orders from the `` comintern '' in moscow and organised by the belgrade . 
  even our communist leaders , completely subservient at the time to moscow , took part by sending bulgarian linguists to skopje to develop the local bulgarian dialect into a separate `` language '' . 
  basically if you greeks had n't sided with the serbs in 1913 , when they took that region and refused to redistribute land according to ethnic plebiscites , you would n't have the whole trouble you do with fyrom today , with the name and all your history being taken by the serb-communist creation of a made-up nation . 
  well , are n't most turks either slavs or greeks by blood ? 
  to be fair , dobruja has only a romanian majority in the past 100 years or so , after it was given to you by the russians in exchange for besssarabia in 1878 . 
  before that it was mainly tatar-turk-circassian , and before the ottoman period firmly bulgarian , being part of pretty much every single bulgarian state since 681ad , when the very first one was created then . 
  even before 681ad and the creation of bulgaria there , it was inhabited by some of the `` 7 slavic tribes '' ( as was most of romania by the way ) . 
  so that `` bridge '' of slavs from south to north was firmly there for more than 1000 years , and you only `` cut '' it in the past 100 after being given dobrudja by the russians . 
  vulgar is a latin word centuries older than the very first mention of the bulgars or bulgaria . 
  their name is iranic and most likely comes from places in eastern iran , bulgh , balkh or balkaria , close to afghanistan today . 
  towards whom ? 
  is n't russia their only guarantee against the turkey-azerb . 
  anti-armenian axis ? 
  the only other relevant power - us , is a strong turkey ally , as well as a strong israel ally , which happens to be ( perhaps surprisingly ) one of the closest azerb . 
  partners . 
  i truly feel for the armenians . 
  decimated by , uhm , `` history '' , landlocked between two larger , hostile nations , and left with only russia ( of all the countries ) to depend on . 
  if i could , i 'd drag them into nato even today , too bad with nagorno-karabakh and their turkey problems it would never happen . 
  yes i am , because the idea of nationhood is just that - an `` idea '' , an illusion even , of shared direct ancestry and blood ties to the people who have lived in this particular land for centuries and millenia . 
  this idea can live on 100 % strong inside people who ca n't tell if their ancestry actually belongs here or not . 
  i am whit , the people who lived here for thousands of years are white - i * can * be 100 % descendand and blood related to them and this land . 
  i * can * consider myself an indigeneous person , same as the aboriginals in australia or congolese in the congo . 
  this idea however can not live on if you look in the mirror and clearly see that your ancestry lies elsewhere and has nothing to do with the people who lived here all the way up until very , very recently . 
  being a white person in japan you ca n't fool yourself that you are an indigenous to japan . 
  being black in russia , being white in nigeria , etc. 
  racial diversity destroys the idea of ethnic nationhood that i find the pinnacle of human societal organisation , for various historical reasons which i wo n't open up not as this is a very long different topic . 
  to preserve this idea strong , i support the homogenisation , not diversity , of the `` old societies '' - ergo not the ones that were entirely recently created in the colonial world of americas and australia after the indegenous people died off almost entirely . 
  here 's my explantion of this a bit more precisely here : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4m699l/the_new_germans_time_to_redefine_what_it_means_to/d3swvnc, 
  there 's as much entertainment for people of all ages , as there is in any meditteranean resort . 
  the prize is pretty much the only difference with portugal or teneriffe . 
  it looks pretty [ much the same too . 
  ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=sunny+beach+bulgaria&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjgyz2uio7nahxkobqkhwqrcv0q_auibygb&amp;biw=1132&amp;bih=933 ), 
  no , i called the turkish state autocratic , meaning erdogan and the akp government which imprisons people for their opinion or criticism , like any autocratic regime does . 
  that 's what this means :  we do n't have an autocratic state like they do, 
  ca n't say all that detail , ai n't a real estate agent and i live in the capital so no info of my own . 
  i do know there 's plenty of villages now around the country where the houses are almost exclusively owned by foreigners , the `` english villages '' we call them cause the uk is the most often home of these people . 
  they come only for the summer and then leave . 
  must be happy if these villages are growing the pace that they are . 
  you should n't google for more info , that 's all i know . 
  i 'd love to answer you if you explain anything of what you wrote , i honetly understood nothing . 
  if i have to explain why you are an autocratic state , i 'd suggest you remember ( because i 'm sure you know of it ) the ammount of people prosecuted for `` insulting the president '' , the ammount of websites closed down by the government for political reasons , the ammount of critics or comedians prosecuted , or hte ammount of journalists attacked , prosecuted or blackmailed . 
  you can start here : https://www.cpj.org/europe/turkey/ here : http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/02/2013217124044793870.html, 
  lol , 500 eur a month ? 
  here you buy large houses in the countryside for 2500-3000 euro . 
  smaller towns i guess is shit , not many young people there . 
  in larger ones , especially sea side , ski resorts and capital it 's widespread . 
  so is anyone who sees your racist posts and calls you out on them automatically a fan of germany ? 
  :d are you a 5 year old to argue like that ? 
  eh , i ' v travelled most of europe and seen similar levels of `` conning '' around . 
  nothing special here , you do n't need a local , you need to simply pay attention as much as in any travel location outisde of bloody impecable scandinavia . 
  says the guy who wrote : '' `` the arab world is 10 times better than anything western '' and a bunch of other openly racist/xenophobic anti-western posts praising how `` superior '' the arabs and muslims are . 
  you ' r just like the turks in this news - the pot calling the kettle black . 
  a muslim xenophobe from bulgaria , who spews hate on the west and then turns around to call them racist/xenophobic . 
  why did n't you fuck off to turkey or the arab world if it 's better in all possible ways ? 
  it 's almost as if celtic heritage purifies the air , and still speaking the language purifies it further . 
  shitposting of the highest magnitute . 
  more tourists here i hope . 
  pls come , we do n't have an autocratic state like they do , we do n't really have a state at all in fact !, 
  pls come , need monys for ... stuff . 
  what 's ridiculous about it ? 
  you want to be 100 % accepted as a local , but ca n't 100 % abandon the non-local part of yourself ?
