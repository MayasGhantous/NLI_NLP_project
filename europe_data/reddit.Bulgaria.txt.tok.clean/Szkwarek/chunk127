  then you wo n't be 100 % accepted as a local . 
  it 's entirely logical correlation . 
  an ahmed will never be 100 % accepted as a german . 
  period . 
  blame 10,000 years of european history that made it so ahmed is n't a name from the local culture , but from the distant arab one . 
  do n't blame the people who are aware of this history and the fact that it is n't . 
  imagined ancestry is . 
  something that can be made , fabricated even , by doing the things above . 
  the children or grandchildren of this arab guy will have it if he does all the things i mentioned . 
  a bit more difficult with black or mongoloid people in white nations though , here 's my point about it : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4m699l/the_new_germans_time_to_redefine_what_it_means_to/d3swvnc, 
  the problem in europe is n't that a whole bunch of children of immigrants desperately want to be accepted as local ( germans , french etc , ) , but the locals do n't accept them as such . 
  the problem is that those children of immigrants want to be accepted as equally `` local '' , despite not making any effort to embrace the local identity and culture . 
  they do n't give their children local names , they do n't encourage them to mix and marry with locals , they do n't abandon the identity , religion , traditions and history of their parents , etc. 
  if the son of arab immigrants renamed himself into hanz gruber , became a christian or an atheist , married a local woman and dressed in european fashion - he would 100 % be accepted . 
  the problem is that instead they grow up as ahmed ensour , attend regularly mosque , do n't agree with the local sex and gender relations , do n't give a damn about local history and culture , demand they 100 % live within arab communities grown in germany as some kind of enclaves , but then complain they are n't considered `` german '' . 
  well of course they are n't - because they have n't assimilated into the german nation . 
  and then some leftists demand that instead of assimilating foreigners , we go the long road and redefine what it means to be `` german '' or `` french '' , in order to include these people technically in the term . 
  true fact : the city in half-life 2 was based on sofia , bulgaria , because one of the designers was bulgarian and proposed they use the commie blocks here as blueprint for the post-apocaliptic atmosphere of the game . 
  * so proud *, 
  what you bring up is the age old question of whether a nation can be formed from various , quite different regions , or must those regions achieve independence and be a nation in their own . 
  what we argue is if the group as a building block has had more than one racial , cultural and identity element in european history . 
  this `` group '' i called nation , but was wrong since not all nations are made of one , coherent region , like mine or the hungarians . 
  i should ' v used another term . 
  but the fact remains - saami people are belong to one racial group , one cultural group and one identity . 
  so too the sicilians . 
  so too the basque . 
  or the polish . 
  call it a nation or call it a regional group if you want - the native people of europe have not historically been mixed groups of multi-racial individuals from all over the world , as they have been trying to make them in the past 20 years . 
  this is a historical fact , and people go as far as calling this fact `` racist '' . 
  this is 100 % your right to hold as opinion and no one can impose his vision of what the nation is on you . 
  nor can you do it either on them though . 
  which is what the problem for many is - that those who have adopted alternative views of what the community is are trying to impose them on those who chose to remain with the established criteria of ancestry . 
  you also said that `` the arab world is 10 times better than anything western '' in another thread , as well as a plethora of highly racist comments about how arabs and all arab is superior and how shitty `` westerners '' and everythin western is . 
  making you either a self-hating western , or an arab , racist . 
  as much as any racism you try to point out here . 
  accepting historical realities and facts ca n't be `` racist '' or belong to any other modern definition of politics . 
  they mere `` are '' . 
  merely `` exist '' . 
  every european nation belongs to to only one particular race , cultural group and identity , that 's a historical fact , not an opinion . 
  why does the truth hurt ? 
  i know very well of ancestors , very close actually of mine , who are n't from my country . 
  i graduated history and know quite better than you of the immense genetic closeness of people from each region across nations . 
  there are no `` genetic nations '' . 
  no `` pure blood '' . 
  none of these facts somehow `` open our eyes '' , disprove the nationalist idea or make multi-culturalism and multi-racial nations a better construct . 
  from the article : `` there is really only one last hurdle to germany officially becoming a land of immigrants , and it is politics . 
  the centre-right christian democratic union , led by angela merkel , and its conservative bavarian sister party , the christian social union '' so the germans elect the main obstacle to this idea , whist simultaniaously opposing it ? 
  according to you , that is . 
  and by the way , the party and merkel started massively losing support among the germans not after years of declaring that `` multi-kulti is dead '' , but after they opened germany to the migrants . 
  the more the ruling coalition has supported the wave towards germany , the more it has lost support among the germans . 
  the facts do n't seem to line up with your , typically sheltered and isolated , liberal worldview . 
  nor does the masively increasing right-wing and nationalist sentiments across the continent . 
  i 'm sure you wo n't deny that at least . 
  how is something `` dead '' , if the lbierals keep crying it is on the rise ? 
  is accepting the historical reality that your nation belongs to only one particular race , cultural group and identity racist ? 
   all you guys keep repeating  yes it has . 
  please let it rest . 
  it 's not coming back . 
  it 's already over and you are bemoaning its loss as if it happened yesterday . 
  it 's a done deal . 
  it 's either one or the other . 
  either the idea is dead , or `` we are all '' still believing in it . 
  how can you be tired of hearing so many people talk of an idea , which is `` dead and not coming back '' . 
  if we are all talking of it , then obviously it 's not dead and does n't need to `` come back '' , because it 's been here all the time . 
  if your circle of liberal , multi-cultural friends seems like the idea is dead and gone , does n't mean this is how all of society views it . 
  it just means you ' r another typical example of a liberal living in his own isolated world and circle of friends , thinking his view of the world is the `` modern , future '' one and all else is `` forgotten and abandoned conservative tradition '' . 
  i read this today , so i asked my question regarding this today . 
  has this type of thinking dissapeared since nov 2015 , for my question to not be relevant anymore ? 
  to the poster : by writing this made-up accusation filled with things i never wrote or expressed , you prove the stereotype of the `` dumb , bigoted , quick to judge others eastern european '' , making us all look bad . 
  i have never said i worship `` blond germans '' , particurarly considering i am black haired . 
  i do not consider most arabs to be of a different race or skin colour than most bulgarians , myself included . 
  i love jews , i ' v tried learning a bit of hewbrew but it was too difficult . 
  how do you know i am christian ? 
  about 80 % of my nation are atheists , so your stereotype of the `` christian eastern european '' does n't work either . 
  `` no one in eastern europe ( at least 90 % of the people ) cares about the way the arabs look and no one is worshipping blond germans ( except for small amounts of skin heads ) . '', 
  - this is highly incorrect , especially about eastern europe , and you know it , yet you write it because you are a liberal from the east who is highly ashamed of his people and tries very hard to show `` the westerners '' that people here are n't `` all like you think '' . 
  basically , you are the one worshipping westerners and trying hard to make them like you . 
  `` in fact i find arabs and tanned-white cultures far more interesting than '' - who cares what you like ? 
  what 's that to do with any of the topic , my post or what we discuss here ? 
  being a cultural relativist , detached from any one culture but his own modern preferences is all fine , really . 
  but there are people , believe it or not , who actually care deeply for the survival of certain cultural and historical identities , traditions and elements , which only exist in particular regions , and are only carried on by people who are born there and develop those particular identities . 
  these people see a threat to that when their regions get filled with people who carry on other , foreign cultural and historical identities . 
  and they have the right to want to stop that major demographic change far more than the cultural nihilists and relativists have to demand our regions open their doors to all and everyone from around the earth , and accept that anyone who lives in our regions is from the same group as we are , even if he carries none of our cultural and historical identity . 
  precisely , you are very much correct . 
  it 's not the direct , ethnic , proven ancestry of one person to , say the bulgarian nation , that matters for a strong personal identificaiton with that group and its culture and history . 
  it 's the ** idea ** of that . 
  the ** idea ** that '' * i have been here for centuries * '' through my family tree , and thus the history of this land and people is * my * history . 
  the culture they developed is * my * culture . 
  the land they lived on is * my * land . 
  when you have this idea in your head , however wrong it may even be because for example actually you do n't know that your great-great grandparends are gypsies from afghanistan , this * idea * makes you want to cherish and preserve all those things - the history , the culture , the traditions , the identity and the land that you believe your ancestors gave you . 
  when you do n't have this idea , this delusion even , you do n't care . 
  if bulgaria gets filled with immigrants from africa , black , their blackness will always tell them through te mirror that they are n't here for centuries . 
  they do n't have the connection to this land 's history , people and culture . 
  they do n't have a reason to care for it or to preserve it . 
  as already happens in western europe where the vast majority of local second or even third generation muslims do n't give two shits for the history , historical people or historical culture of say , france or germany . 
  if they were to become the majority , those would compltely die . 
  become what `` roman '' culture and identity are today . 
  just a part of history . 
  you need the idea of ancestry in each nation in europe in order for the historical identities and cultures we have developped on this continent to survive into the future . 
  instead , if you fill the continent with people from africa and asia , as opposed to the delusion those people will either fully assimilate or perhaps create some `` new '' - `` american '' - style identity for all , in reality they will merely replace our local european cultures and identity with already existing such in the arab , sub-saharan or central asian worlds .
