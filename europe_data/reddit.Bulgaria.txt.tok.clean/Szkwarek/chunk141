  similar to how cultural , even non-practicing , muslims from one end of the world -- say pakistan , express solidarity with the palestinians vs the jews , or with european muslims , or with muslim refigees in the us . 
  not so much a matter of religion , as a sort of `` tribal loyalty '' towards a perceived civilization . 
  to the pakistani -- the `` muslim civilization '' even if he does n't believe , same as to the american from bumfuckville it 's `` the western civilization '' , which happens to overlap historically with most of the christian world . 
  i reserve no judgment , agreeing or disagreeing , as this would be a totally new and big discussion . 
  i just make an assessment of their position . 
  hopefully someone else can decide to argue with you and we can see both sides of the argument in person . 
  they took their legal documents by force ? 
  as in they assaulted/robbed them of it ? 
  according to which system of ethics and morality ? 
  in what role of their lives ? 
  in the role of parents , citizens , friends etc. 
  - sure . 
  in their role as bankers they have to follow the law , satisfy their customers and bring profit to the bank . 
  that 's all . 
  if it 's within the law , they can and should do it . 
  are you a white european ? 
  i read it . 
  my question remains - these people are not forced to work in these shops , so it is n't slavery . 
  their alternative before western factories was local sustenance agriculture or unemployment and starvation . 
  how is giving them a better opportunity from the locally existing ones a bad thing ? 
  yes , there are banks that break the law in every country . 
  i doubt anyone actually believed there were countries where no one broke the law . 
  i 'd say every political side has its brain-dead conspiracy theories or ideas that float around and are more prevalent on the fringes . 
  on the right - core ideas like personal freedom over government control might lead you to the fringe ideas of nwg in the same way the core left ideas of social equity end up leading you to marxist forums or soviet apologetics . 
  it 's all about staying within the sane realm of whatever political spectrum you inhabit . 
  sure , that 's all that should be expected of banks - to follow local law . 
  not to be `` moral '' in whatever moral compass one has and thus accuse them of `` immorality '' when they are n't . 
  which happens quite often these days , especially when talking of `` banksters '' , and to me just seems like ignorance of the sorts it would be to call your toaster `` immoral '' . 
  cheers . 
  banks are not meant to be ethical , but to provide a range of services to society in exchange for a profit . 
  as every other business . 
  from my understanding they range greatly from conspiracy nuts believing in the above article on one side , all the way to regular nationalists or even libertarians on the other . 
  oops , a troll , my bad . 
  why should i get over being told by the state how to speak ? 
  my parents were told that for decades before 1989 and did n't `` get over it '' . 
  why should i ? 
   snowflake i do n't understand . 
  why call me that ? 
  they 'll take you on a free walk on the czech streets ^ tm, 
   but syria is a warzone and unlike you guyd who preach human rights yet you do nothing we actually help those poor souls . 
  then why do you bitch and moan to me that you do n't want them ? 
  make up your mind , first you do n't want them - when i tell you not to take them then , you say you should because there 's a war . 
   those turks were invited and then they helped rebuild their nation . 
  besides those turks always vote left in their countries . 
  they dont do anything to impose anything on native population . 
  their only problem is how they meddle in turkish politics which is none of your problem . 
  what ? 
  what turks are you talking of ? 
  i thought we were talking about the refugees that we build a wall to stop from pouring from turkey into the eu . 
  what turks now , what rebuilding , what turkish politics ? 
   yes you deserve them for all the west europe supports to pkk . 
  pkk is declared a terrorist organisation by all of western europe , every single country . 
  sending them any weapons is a criminal offence . 
  you are obviously misinformed . 
  western europe has nowhere to get enough numbers of muslims to cause a palestine style conflict , other than africa . 
  the entire mid east has half the population of europe , and those inside europe alrady have sharply dropping birth rates . 
  if we cut their social spending this will solve the problem completely . 
  hence it is precisely africa that we should worry about . 
  4 billion people in such a dire situation means tens of millions trying desperately to get to europe . 
  look at the broader political context . 
  they have a beef with what they see as a push from the left and liberal circles towards ever increasing dismantling of the pillars of what these people consider `` the western civilization '' - things like capitalism , nation-states , ethno-nations , christian roots of culture and identity , nuclear family and gender roles , homogeneus communities , natural rights concept etc. 
  collectively they ' v dubbed this push `` globalisation '' , and sometimes `` progressivism '' . 
  in their eyes , the main proponents of this in the us is the democratic party , and in europe - the various left-wing or liberal parties that also happen to be highly pro-eu . 
  they believe those parties are trying to use the eu , same as the democrats use the federal government , to channel this `` globalisation '' or spread/impose the `` progressivism '' onto the indigenous peoples of europe , whom they associate with on racial , historical , ancestral and cultural grounds . 
  thus they associate `` state rights vs federal control '' in the us with state sovereignty vs eu control in europe . 
  particularly worrying for them is the perceived replacement through open borders and eu 's refugee quotas of their perceived `` cousins '' - the indigenous europeans , with people from africa and asia , predominantly of muslim religious affiliation . 
  pls no hate , i 'm just paraphrasing what i believe are their views . 
  feel free to correct me or add . 
  so let me get that straight - you think the situation in syria would ' v been better had the state not been armed , because then it would be easy to overthrow that state when it is run by an autocrat like assad . 
  it pains me to even argue that statement . 
  how did you not think of the logical conclusion from this as you were writing it - that if the syrian state were easy to topple with assad running it , it would be just as easy , if not more , to topple afterwards when a government is trying to run it as well . 
  are you completely unaware of the demographic , religious , ethnic and political composition of the mid east ? 
  it 's not a mass of democracy loving liberals vs a tiny bunch of islamists vs a few dictators . 
  without a strong syrian army the state would be toppled by islamists like isis with ease . 
  or the ethnic and religious groups would descend it in internal conflict . 
  the sunns hate the alawites and vice verse , the kurds want out of both , the shia militias are supported by iran and hezbolah . 
  you want no strong army present , just leave all of this to devolve into a complete yugoslav shitshow . 
  why ? 
   and i dont want refugees either !, 
  do n't let them come in then , rather than sending them to us . 
   whereas you guys claim to be the beacon of civilization , human rights etc. 
  yes , europe certainly is those things compared to the rest of the world , and i 'd like it to remain such - a place that is liberal , secular and free for all its citizens . 
  which will certainly change if millions of muslims and africans pour into our societies during the 21st century , start imposing their stone-age traditions , shit religion and medieval authoritarianism . 
  just like you turks did with akp over there . 
   why do we get to deal with them too ? 
  cause you let them in . 
  not our fault . 
   you guys deserve it . 
  no we do n't . 
   erdogan was dumb enough to sign that deal . 
  you elected him , not us . 
  your fault , your problem , do n't dump it on us . 
  there 's no `` right '' manner - only how i choose to refer to you . 
  you have no power over me and my speech other than deciding not to like me and communicate with me . 
  to try and use state power to impose certain form of speech is disgusting and highly authoritarian . 
  to go as far as destroy the established and perfectly fine binary gender correlation with sex in human speech is impractical as it serves over 99 % of the population . 
  there 's a ton on the thirty years war or the swedish deluge in poland . 
  ** in germany ** : [ the swedish armies alone may have destroyed up to 2,000 castles , 18,000 villages , and 1,500 towns in germany , one-third of all german towns ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thirty_years%27_war#casualties_and_disease ) ** in poland ** : the swedish invasion affected the richest provinces of the polish -- lithuanian commonwealth ( greater poland , lesser poland , mazovia , pomerelia , kujawy , podlasie ) , which for the most part had not been affected by major wars for 200 years . 
  professor andrzej rottermund , manager of the royal castle in warsaw , claims that the swedish army robbed poland of her most precious goods - thousands of works of art , books and valuables . 
  [ 22 ] most of these items have never been returned to poland , and are kept both in private swedish hands , and in stockholm museums , such as swedish army museum , and livrustkammaren .
