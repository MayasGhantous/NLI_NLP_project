  almost all cities , towns , castles and churches in locations where swedish troops were stationed were destroyed ; and as prof. rottermund says this can be seen even today , as in guides to many polish towns and cities one will find a note that says `` object destroyed during swedish invasion '' . 
  from the royal castle in warsaw the swedes stole app . 
  200 paintings , a number of carpets and turkish tents , musical instruments , furniture , chinese porcelain , weapons , books , manuscripts , marbles , even dresses of maids and door frames pulled from walls . 
  [ 22 ] huber kowalski of the university of warsaw institute of archeology says that swedes stole anything they could lay their hands on - windows , stairs , chimneys , sculptures , floors , doors and gates . 
  most goods were loaded on boats and transported along the vistula to the baltic sea , and then to sweden . 
  in november 2011 , archeologists of the university of warsaw found app . 
  70 items ( total weight five tons ) , which probably come from the warsaw royal castle . 
  they sank in the vistula while being transported to sweden . 
  according to the estimates of polish scholars i. ihnatowicz , z. landau , a. m\u0105czak and b. zientara , the invasion by the swedish army and its allies ( brandenburg-prussia and transilvania ) , resulted in the loss of 25 % of the population in four core polish provinces . 
  lesser poland lost 23 % of population , mazovia 40 % in villages and 70 % in towns , greater poland 50 % in villages and 60 % in towns . 
  royal prussia lost some 60 % of its population https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deluge_ ( history ) #destruction _ of_the_commonwealth, 
  why has it been accused of that ? 
  what 's wrong with giving employment in factories to unemployed people in third world countries ? 
  what 's exploitatory about children working in bangladesh for western companies ? 
  africa will quadruple its population this century to 4 billion people in 2100 , at the same time as experiencing the world 's worst soil degradation process of its most fertile lands , as well as the worst effects of climate change . 
  one has to be delusional not to see this as the perfect storm for conflicts and wars as well . 
  if they do n't drastically reduce their fertility , like right the fuck now , they are fucked big time . 
  and we might be as well if waves of millions from them come this way . 
  imposing their idea of [ `` gender neutral speech '' ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gender-neutral-pre-school-accused-of-mind-control-2305983.html ) on others . 
  [ especially when on kids . 
  ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/feb/02/swedish-schools-gender-alien-concept ) bbc : http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14038419, 
  `` we '' should n't compensate anyone for anything that we did n't do to him . 
  there is no such thing as ancestral or communal guild . 
  no `` blood debt '' . 
  every individual is born with a clean slate and is responsible for his actions only . 
  and even if we accepted the idiotic , stone-age idea of ancestral guilt , then the europeans would by far not be only ones having to pay to someone else . 
  pretty much every person on earth has ancestors who conquered , enslaved or invaded others , at some point . 
  it 's a sign of `` pop-history 's '' prevelance in modern culture that swedish aggression/warfare is associated almost always with the vikings ( who were actually more famously danish and norwegian ) , when in reality the swedes did enormously more pillaging , killing and fighting in the 16th and 17th centuries . 
  the extend of the swedish destruction in germany and poland in the 1630s and 1640s-50s alone outshines all viking conquests by their ancestors combined , yet people always refer back to the vikings due to pop-culture history atm and romantization . 
  compassion becomes a doubled edged sword in the case of sweden and the current `` progressive '' wave of politics . 
  ashamed of what ? 
  yes of course no one is worried , my question merely was why * did * romanians even have a claim on southern dobrudja at all , which to my knowledge never ever had a significant romanian population of any kind . 
  that 's why i compared it to us having a claim at some point in our history to , say , cyprus . 
  or bavaria . 
  it just makes no sense even from a nationalistic point of view so i was interested what its genesis was . 
  they are . 
  at least the vast majority of the slavic population there used to identify as such and speak bulgarian before the yugoslav nation-building process . 
  which is what/where ? 
  if half of portugal was founded by those same spanish and theirs longer than the portoguese , who only happened to arrive in the late middle-ages-early renaissance there for ~ 4 centuries . 
  europe is n't the world 's refugee camp . 
  they are muslim and close to you culture - you take them . 
  we 'll take ukrainian refugees and such closer to our culture . 
  peace for all . 
  it 's not our problem most wars keep getting fought within muslim countries . 
  [ serious ] what is the claim the romanians have of it ? 
  at what point did they inhabit southern dobroja even at 20 % of the demographic ? 
  to me it sounds like bulgaria claiming cyprus . 
  depends which ones . 
  some were captured . 
  others were bought . 
  and still others were [ literary made by hand ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=finrqcocwge ) or manufactured once they captured land and wealth . 
  it is equally idiotic to believe the world can be rid of all weapons and we can live in a stateless society of disarmed and peaceful hippies . 
  you have no idea of the kind of people that populate this planet . 
  i am sure the parents of the children being raped and murdered in iraq and syria because the local militaries were underprepared to protect them from isis and the other jihadist militias would spit in your delusional anarchist face if they could . 
  the delusions and idiocy of anarchists like you are not just stupid , they are dangerous and cancerous in a world where military threats are still very much a reality . 
  it 's part of nato and as such has obligations to help militarily any nato member who triggers article 5 . 
  if it comes to that having modern and advanced equipment can : 1 . 
  provide better support in that conflict , wherever it may be . 
  save danish lives . 
  i clearly meant it as a continuous cultural-identity group . 
  you do not identify the same way ethno-nationally or state-wise as your ancestors did 2000 years ago . 
  the armenians , however , do . 
  from the 1,153,465 square kilometres we lost . 
  imagine spain reduced to castile alone after a century of occupation and genocide and then asked to be grateful for that . 
  armenia is one of the few truly ancient people who have survived till this day . 
  i 'm polish , we did lose a lot in the 20th century , macedonia is not part of it . 
  come back if you can actually refute any of the facts i laid above . 
  nope , they did n't . 
  they lived in pella and all over what is currently northern greece . 
  [ this was actual ancient kingdom of macedon ] ( http://geonetia.ru/proekt/slov_proect3/images/img_206238.jpg ) - in modern day northern greece . 
  the lands of modern day fyrom were known as paeonia and were neither where alexander and phillip lived/born , or at all where their kingdom and people resided . 
  these slavs in fyrom today , whatever nationality they choose , have nothing to do with the ancient kingdom of macedon or its rulers , yet they build them monuments and call stuff after them . 
  they even [ dress themsleves as alexander 's warriors for plays and such ] ( http://vek21press.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/big_tn_370719macedonian-falanga-2005.jpg ) or go as far as to invite some afghan royalty or whatever and claim he is a descendand of alexander returning to `` his people '' . 
  it 's a circus of a country really . 
  if it is a proof of their recent national creation and utter lack of any separate national history - is up to everyone to decide for themselves . 
  by having offical statues of alexander the great , names of the airport , names and statues of phillip , and other such commemorations regarding ancient macedonia is n't the republic of macedonia effectively claiming that ancient state as its historical predecessor ? 
  the soviet occupation of bessarabia , bukovina , eastern poland , latvia , lithuania , estonia , invasion of finland or hungary is `` dirty insinuations '' . 
  to use so desperately whatever my nationality you believe is against my argument here means you believe in ancestral and national guilt that should dictate what rights they have to speak today based on what their ancestors or members of their nations did , correct ? 
  actually in polish history it is remembered as the best of the 3 empires that partitioned it - with prussia and especially russia being far more brutal , oppressive , backwards and illiberal . 
  austria championed what was known as `` enlightened absolutism '' as opposed to prussia 's military absolutism ( later prussian constitutionalism ) or russia 's samoderzhavie . 
  the poles were the least oppressed and the least assimilated in austria of all the empires , and the same applied to the other nations within austria . 
  it certainly was n't as bad as others of it 's time , and `` prison of nations '' in fact was far more relevant for russia . 
  bulgaria was [ indeed much larger than shown here ] ( http://thewaythetruthandthelife.net/map/european-atlas-500-929_files/ce893-927_tsar-simeon-bulgaria-by-todor-bozhinov-519px.bmp ), 
  not in the [ 13th century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/bulgaria_under_iwan_assen_ii.jpg ) it certainly was n't , and yet still much larger than shown here . 
  i am not bulgarian , i am polish , the very idea that you can dismiss an accusation towards the red army on the grounds of someone 's nationality is pathetic . 
  even if i was bulgarian i did n't commit the above crimes , did i ? 
  i am an individual who is responsible for his crimes only , so it would only be hypocrisy if i were a rapist who accused the red army of rape . 
  i am not , so i have as much right to accuse it as anyone else in the world . 
  individuals do not carry ancestral responsibility or national one for the acts of other individuals . 
  because of the above 2 points there is absolutely no need for me to defend or excuse bulgaria to have the right to criticise the red army . 
  but i will still do it because you are also factually wrong : - bulgaria participated in the second world war only to reunite with its ethnic lands that were taken from it in the balkan and first world war . 
  it did n't declare war on the soviet union and remained the only axis power to keep diplomatic relations with it and not send any army to help hitler in his conquests . 
  at what point in russian history was all private enterprise , private capital or private wage labour abolished ? 
  i graduated history and still ca n't think of such examples in russia , and for the world i can only think of extremely short lived examples when it comes to prior the 20th century . 
  all such examples in world history that lasted for more than a few months/couple of years , were marxist soviet-style regimes of the 20th century . 
  the marxist nature of the ussr is in my view ridiculous to deny , regardless of its other - imperialist , despotic and colonial attitudes . 
  if anything , the presence of the latter merely show marxism can easily coexist with them , instead of being the liberatory force in some people 's minds . 
  i nowhere disagreed it was imperialism as well . 
  but society itself absolutely * was * subjected to numerous marxist economic and social elements , such as the above mentioned ones . 
  were the people robbed of their land in collectivisation ?
