  do you ? 
  and how can you call yourself a defender of liberal values if you do ? 
   treating differently minorities ( be it religious , ethnic or sexual ) just because it 's racism . 
  i do n't hear mainstream leftist parties and politicians accepting islamism , bigotry or negative discrimination . 
  you mist live under a rock then . 
  [ from swedish and german greens having open islamists inside their parties . 
  ] ( http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/04/sweden-green-party-infiltrated-islamists-160426130534157.html ) [ to uk labour council members covering the rotherham sex gang for years because they were exclusively muslims targeting native girls and labour feared racism accusations . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal ) i can go on for a long time , it is a habit for the left/liberal in europe right now to take the stance of open islamists or criminals for fear of racism accusations . 
  the left seems to have no problem discriminating against fascists or nazis , but it has a big problem to discriminate against islamists , despite these being pretty much equally against the left 's and liberals ' core values . 
  that 's what pc culture means - you stop fighting your ideological enemies when they happen to have a different skin colour because you are mortally affraid of the `` r '' word . 
  that 's a strong argument indeed , but based on his platform he seems far too right wing on many issues to be a nazi in my opinion . 
  his ties to them seemed to be purely due to their common islamophobia and xenophobia , which are n't enough to claim someone is a nazi . 
  they are core ideas of that ideology , sure , but not the only core ones , and his views seemed to often contradict directly with more core nazi issues than these two . 
  i absolutely agree . 
  but i still fail to see how the candidate discussed is a nazi . 
  the religion in question is the current most widespread form of fascism in the world , so it should n't be the people opposing it who get excluded or shunned , but the ones promoting it . 
  if you are a liberal , at least , i do n't expect you to share my view if you are a religious/conservative person . 
  but without a government who will build roaaaads !!, 
  i can make the exact same dismissal of the far-right as populist . 
  `` if you think anti-immigration and anti-islam is just an empty phrase , try and live [ as a woman in a muslim neighbourhood ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tsygfeg1iy ) . '', 
  just because the issue is valid does n't mean it ca n't be used in a populist manner . 
  the plight of the poor is a valid issue used in a populist manner by people with marxist tendencies whose real goals are driven by hatred , jealousy and ignorance more than empathy . 
  otherwise it would n't be precisely the left and `` social democrats '' who currently ridicule `` the poor , uneducated bigots '' who en mass vote for the far right because the left has abandondened them and their problems in favour of cultural relativism and `` progressivism '' . 
  being poor in germany or the us is the absolute best place you can be poor anywhere on earth ( + a few other similar western countries ) , or at any point in human history . 
  the left has n't stopped pretending they are n't all marxists at the very core and jump from one new , fissionable label to the other - `` social democrats '' and `` greens '' is the latest fad , so why should the right not do the same ? 
  oh-oh , you just hit a nerve on r/europe . 
  this sub , as with most places dominated by 20-something year old european/american users , has contracted the `` social democracy '' , `` muuuuuh scandinavia '' sickness . 
  they think they are totally not socialists though and * their * specific kind of marxist appropriation and theft is neither theft , nor marxist . 
  somehow . 
  historians tore your country apart ? 
  it 's not a matter of opinion but of the availability or lack thereof of any historical source that mentions slovaks at that time . 
  please do prove me wrong by showing such or even a second-hand citing that such exist . 
  i can show you numerous that mention bulgarians , hungarians , serbs or others at the time , primary and secondary . 
  our nationhood was created with our state called bulgaria , same as it was with the hungarians , the serbs , the poles and many others . 
  sometimes the state would stop existing , for 100 years occupied by the byzantines , for 480 by the ottomans , but the nation already was born with that name and that identity when it happened . 
  the `` slovak '' nation was born when ? 
  when we hear of it for the first time - same as with every other . 
  when is the first time we hear of `` the slovak people '' doing this or that ? 
  certainly not at the time of great moravia . 
  yep , completely different from the 20th century nationhood called slovakia . 
  or else it would be called ... slovakia . 
  same as bulgaria was called bulgaria in 681ad , hungary called hungary , serbia called serbia , poland called poland , england called england , etc. 
  from ? 
  oh , so you are one of * those * nations that artificially impose their late , 20th century nationhood onto completely different entities from hundreds or thousands of years ago . 
  here , let me introduce you to macedonia and belarus . 
  a language who 's largest vocabulary belongs to linguistic group a is most certainly classified within that group . 
  please provide examples of the opposite . 
  tell that to a bulgarian , i 'm polish . 
  ooops , did i spoil your attempt at a butthurt ad hominem ? 
  the kurds i ' v met at university were quite nationalistic , with flags et all , and absolutely hated the turks and turkey . 
  whatever happend to turkey will have little to no effect on me . 
  i 'm polish and the most that could happen even if magically we went back to the 17th century and had a large ottoman empire is that we kick your ass from europe again , sobieski style . 
  if in the english vocabulary the largest linguistic group was romance , of course it would be called a romance language . 
  it is n't though , germanic is the largest percentage of its vocabulary . 
  in romanian slavic was the largest percentage of vocabulary , standing at around 40 % in the early 1800s . 
  so of course it was a `` slavic language '' , that 's what this classification of languages means . 
  not what you like it to mean or not . 
  stop being so butthurt about your own history - it 's pathetic and quite offensive to all your ancestors who were linguistically slavic regardless if you like it or not . 
  lol , who 's `` bothering '' romania of all the countries ? 
  :d first time i hear someone at all is insisting to be in the company of romania or romanians . 
  our countries look up to states like germany , england or the us , not romania . 
  no one cares about you , get over your delusions . 
  someone 's salty, 
  wow , someone 's mad . 
  that 's such a stereotype in this topic . 
  romanian vocabulary was an upwards of 40 % slavic at the start of the 1800s . 
  before the latinisation process , which was a completely artificial government effort through education to replace as many slavic words with direct italian or french ones . 
  they artificially replaced about 25 % of their words with new french and italian borrowings , bringing slavic down to the current 15 % , from 40 % 200 years ago . 
  when you spoke a 40 % slavic language the rest was n't all romance , it was a mix of old dacian , romance , hungarian , german and turkish words , making the 40 % slavic ones the largest group . 
  you were never a predominantly slavic language , but slavic words * were * up until the 1800s your largest vocabulary . 
  furthermore , you wrote in the slavic alphabet and old church slavonic ( medieval bulgarian ) was your official church language used on all liturgies . 
  of course your people understood it and were , therefore , very much a slavic speaking population with strong non-slavic ( romance , dacian , turkish ) influences . 
  you only shifted towards a predominantly romance speaking population in the past 200 years , and artificially , through state education . 
  what ? 
  did you even read my comment ? 
  i wrote the same , kurdish nationalism will question the existance of turkey in its current state . 
  i sincerely doubt a turkey divided evenly between kurds and turks will even survive as a geo-political entity , let alone expand . 
   wants to revoke double nationalities , stricter border controls , and they 've been making some fairly nationalist and anti-muslim statements as well . 
  how is that `` damage '' ? 
  those are all sane proposals to mend the trend in the netherlands and western europe as a whole . 
  i remember squares full of protesters against proposed government cuts back in the early 2000s in greece , and here in bulgaria it was big news how year after year the greek farmers would almost routinelly block our border to protest * their * goverment 's proposed reduction of subsidies . 
  ( whilst thus hurting our producers and economy ) so , yes - the greek people were ** very ** active in promoting an overbloated state , spending , wellfare and subsidies , whilst themsleves extremely keen on hiding taxes and vat , which greek friends of mine have explained to me as something that was completely normal not to pay in greece . 
  ( hence why they said they were not used to receiving receipts in greece like they do everywhere for everything here in bulgaria ) for decades the majority of greek people did the following : 1 . 
  elect left-leaning , big state , corrupt parties . 
  protest cuts or tax increases . 
  demand considerable pensions . 
  willingly developed a culture of hiding taxes and vat . 
  wow , waddaya know , the state went bankrupt . 
  but of course , as all balkan people , now they blame * someone else * ... 
  he ** was ** god , at least according to the new testament and the doctrine of christianity , which is what we discuss here . 
  jesus was the god that came to earth and sacrificed himself for the people he loved , after teaching them a form of humanism that was n't seen anywhere in the world until the englightenment period . 
  what an `` evil '' god indeed , saving prostitutes like mary magdalene from stoning by saying `` let the one without sin throw the first stone '' ... 2000 years ago , whilst many parts of the world still do it today . 
  or defending the poor , the sick , the forgotten ... you ' v been indoctrinated by too much millenial `` edgy '' atheism for the sake of being a contrarian . 
  ro are more like * former slavs * . 
  he sacrificed himself , not some random human he chose . 
  right after saying all humans are brothers and sisters , that you should love your enemy , be merciful , charitable and not judgmental or vengeful . 
  i suggest reading the sermon on the mount rather than 9gag to get a grasp of christianity . 
  so then he is correct in saying jesus was n't a paedophile , unlike mohammad ? 
  who do you prefer between the two - a man who never had sex his entire life or one who fucked children ? 
  not the god described by christ in the new testament .
