  because up until now it was merely a game of chance on who is in power . 
  it could be kemal in turkey , it could be mao in china or hitler in germany . 
  those were also social engineering by a few . 
  let me guess - you know what `` the best ideas '' of social engineering are and would be perfect to do it ? 
  the same line of thinking of all those mentioned above . 
  people thinking they know best how a society should change and are willing to coherce it towards said change is one of the worst things in our history . 
  you should realize you are no one , your opinion does n't matter and you are only free to live yourself how you choose , not make that choice for the others based on your calculations of what a `` good social engineering '' will achieve . 
  how is it a strawman to state the very real fact that denying stalin 's , lenin 's , pol pot 's or mao 's mass victims is not prosecuted , whilst doing that with hitler 's victims is ? 
  it is n't though . 
  it 's still impossible to create an equivalent of it with hitler and the nazis without being banned , and in many countries even prosecuted . 
  my point of stalinists and lenninists being totally tolerated currently unlike the nazis all across society still stands . 
  all you wrote i claim of the right as well , with the nazis being the fringe that the vast , vast majority of even the far-right nationalists reject same as you reject stalin 's horrors . 
  yet we ask , why is it then that the nazis and even the non-nazi far right , like nationalists , is under state and societal censorship much more so than the stalinists ? 
  why can you shout `` the kulaks deserved it '' with a stalin upvote , but ca n't shout `` the jews deserved it '' with a hitler upvote ? 
  i believe all should be suppressed or none . 
  anything else is disrespectful to the victims of the side which is not censored , unlike the other . 
  in modern europe , the millions of innocent people killed by the stalinists are basically disrespected when you say it 's fine to say they deserved it , but you will even prosecute if someone says the same about the victims of the nazis . 
  you claimed the comments by u/anarchisto , which i branded as semantics , are not such . 
  i explained why they are . 
  refute or leave . 
  why is it an idiocy to ironically point out at an existing anti-racial attitude currently gaining track ? 
  i also asked for a source of your claims the far-right , which is nationalism with people like mazinni at the core much more so than nazi fringes , inherently teaches genocide . 
  the semantics of your comments is that you equate the entire far-right with national-socialists , a fringe group just like the stalinists in the far-left . 
  i would do the same semantics to call every single far-leftist a khmer rouge or a stalinist and ask him why the entire far left wants mass genocide of bourgeoisie and kulaks . 
  as i already said nazis are n't even remotely a catch-all term for the far-right i discuss here , despite what anarchist radicals like yourself say , same as `` stalinist '' is n't a catch all term for all far-leftists . 
  the extermination of the kulaks or burgeoisie and all who do not immediately give up all they have and their freedom to the stalinist regime is also a central point of it . 
  so why are stalinsts tolerated in society , like at r/fullcommunism , but nazis are n't ? 
  the modern japanese or irish nations are among the most accepting of members with different sexual identities ( ireland voted in referendum for it ) , physical handicaps or freevolous sexual behaviour . 
  in no way has this prevented them from remaining overwhelmingly homogeneus in terms of ethnic/national/racial identity , thus sparing themsleves the entirely unnecesary problems that france , us , sweden or others have and will increasingly have with their minorities . 
  beacuse all it takes to do so is just reduce the mass migration towards your society or do it specifically from culturaly and ethnicly closer nations , which in no way violates anyone 's rights , as there is no such universal right of access to any other nation on earth you choose from . 
  `` really ? 
  if you are such an expert in nationalism , i 'm sure you can give me a quotation of mazzini in which he says you need to exterminate/do genocide on the `` enemy ethnic/national classes '' . 
  i told you u/anarchisto , we can all play your pathetic far-left games of semantics . 
  u/anarchisto , figures . 
  we can all play these games of semantics : `` the far right wants a free and independent nation , the far left wants to exterminate a very large part of the people . 
  ( burgeoisie , owners , rent-seekers , capitalists , kulaks , ideological opponents and all else who refuse the marxist demands ) . 
  same thing . '', 
  correct . 
  as long as you mean by `` we can replace '' or do this or that - a voluntary choice to do so by the majority , not a social-engineering whereby `` we '' - a particular group decide for the majority that this or that tradition we do n't like , is `` backwards '' , and should be changed . 
  traditions like the above for example are voluntarily celebrated by vast swathes of certain societies , so they clearly fall in the category of a voluntary and willing tradition within given society . 
  the presence of societies with deeply rooted communal traditions and identities is not mythologic , but entirely real . 
  homogeneus states like poland , hungary , japan , korea , czechia etc. 
  are provenly and observably more socially cohesive , peaceful and without the numerous tensions and conflicts between various ethnic , racial , religious , cultural etc. 
  groups that the `` diverse '' progressive societies have . 
  did i defend each and every tradition by definition , with no moral or utilitarian essence of each , or did i defend the existence of * some * , of course preferably good , traditions as a tool of communal cohesion ? 
  where did i insist only one group should be allowed to speak ? 
  why are you making a straw-man ? 
  nazis are n't the only far-right group . 
  fascists , nationalists and the like are as well , and in the case of many of them there is no other central point than the love of the given nation , identity or culture , with it thriving as the only central point . 
  all other following actions , such as genocides and ethnic cleansing , are equally only the chosen preferred method of some of them to achieve that , same as the marxists and bolsheviks choose as preferred method genocide to achieve their societal goals . 
  marx was very clear about the essence of what the `` dictatorship of the proletariat '' would be and it fully entitled violence , on a huge scale , against the `` enemy social classes '' . 
  marxism is absolutely inherently violent and genocidal by definition . 
  head right into any of the marxist subreddits here on this very site , full of people either denying , or even outright justifying them . 
  the catchphraze of the so-called `` tankies '' ( stalinists ) is even `` the kulaks deserved it '' , whilst their upvote button is a face of stalin . 
  now imagine a subreddit with the upvote a face of hitler and `` the jews deserved it '' as a `` funny '' catchphrase ? 
  impossible , would get banned immediately - the stalinists , however , are thriving . 
  and they are all westerners , us , canadian and w.europeans , not balkanites or easterners . 
  take a look at some of their subreddits like r/fullcommunism and find even remotely as tolerated right-wing equivalent praising hitler and the holocaust . 
  impossible until the far-left dominates key sectors of society such as the academia , or is pretty much fully accepted and tolerated in politics or public manifestations , whilst anything remotely far-right branded nazi and shunned . 
  leftists are free to deny and openly do so the mass murders of the marxists all over the 20th century , totalling many times over the victims of the holocaust ( which are undeniably at least 6 million people , yet still far fewer in comparison ) . 
  when will they ever be prosecuted or is the mass murder of , say , kulaks by the bolsheviks or pretty much anyone with basic education by the khmer rouge somehow not as important to remember and preserve the knowledge of ? 
  either the denial of all should be illegal , or none . 
  either complete free speech , or equal prosecution for the denial of such crimes throughout history . 
  i agree . 
  hence making it even more funny to use here , as if the eu was ever `` a tormentor '' of the uk . 
  ... refers to kidnapping victims , who by definition ca n't leave their kidnappers . 
  ergo , kinda the opposite of what 's happening with the uk . 
  traditions and communal celebrations have been at the center of human social structure since the evolution of our species . 
  they serve a very real , utilitarian purpose for social cohesion and the perceived unity of the given group . 
  the future belongs to the nations who preserve their stability and internal peace through things seemingly unimportant , like this . 
  whilst the post-modernists wreck instability , havoc and social conflict in their `` progressive '' societies by setting up `` earthquake-prone tectonic lines '' across every inherent difference , identity and social group . 
  what a special , unique , critical and totally independent-thinking little snowflake you are . 
  i hope you ' r in your teens still , for your sake . 
  if you are n't dumb you can answer a single point of the numerous that were already given to you in multiple posts to your thesis without changing the subject with every reply and trying to wiggle your way out of each answer you get . 
  it 's a waste of time to write precise and complete answers to everything you state just so you completely ignore it each time and bring up something new . 
  i can play dumb too , mate . 
  `` so you 're saying every single person on the face of the earth is just the same and there are zero differences between humans and the societies they form ? '', 
  i do n't care if you ' r curious , i will not bait on a detraction from the topic as my society - bulgaria , is not the subject of what we discuss , has been accepting refugees and migrants , and is in fact already the most multicultural society in europe with the highest percentage of muslims - 13 % . 
  either discuss the specific points you have been making here and my answers to them , or just say no longer want to/can and we can end it . 
  so you * do * reject the notion different societies have different core values and cultures that fundamentally differentiate them ? 
  the fact there are regular [ lynchings of people for blasphemy ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-asia-39603126/pakistan-blasphemy-the-student-lynched-for-being-a-humanist ) done voluntarily by the pakistani society does n't indicate at intrinsic , fundamental and difficult to overcome societal/cultural differences with , say , the austrian society ? 
  [ this happening ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tsygfeg1iy ) in european cities as a result of muslim and african migrants moving in is n't , in your eyes , an indication of a lack of assimilation and fundamental cultural differences that some people might not want to bring into their countries ? 
  [ this being brought ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/fgm-cases-in-england-reported-every-109-minutes-a6854911.html ) to europe as a practice does n't indicate this to you ? 
  how many indications do ideologues like yourself need to see a fundamental cultural difference between certain societies or understand why society x might not want to import some specific differences from society y by bringing millions of migrants from it ? 
   if they do n't want to change their culture why do n't they close their border and stop the import of foreing cultural product then ? 
  they do n't want to change their fundamental societal identities , basic values or national and ethnic belonging . 
  not the basic lifestyles that change each generation with the passing of time , technology and `` popular cultural '' fads . 
  you intentionally mix these things and pretend like there is no difference between the cultures of , say , austrian society and pakistani society , because you are running out of arguments on the topic we discuss . 
   and your idea that somehow african and muslim never integrate is quite wrong many do i nowhere expressed the idea that africans and muslims ** never ** and ** integrate ** . 
  i wrote that the vast majority of them , as opposed to no one , and specifically said assimilate , not integrate . 
  again you intentionally change what was expressed by me and mold it into a straw-man as you are unable to answer it . 
  the * majority * of african and muslim immigrants do not fully * assimilate * into the european societies they come to . 
  this is my thesis and the reason easterners do not want mass migration from them . 
  they are n't worse . 
  no one on earth is inherently worse or better , just culturally and ethnically closer or further from any other given society , hence easier or more difficult to assimilate . 
  poland and eeastern europe do n't want to fundamentally replace their identities and cultures , so they only want to accept immigrants from culturally , ethnically and historically closer societies , which will be easy to assimilate rather than create the permanent , foreign colonies and exclaves that africans and mid-easterners have formed all over western europe , due to the fundamental differences that make full assimilation almost non-present . 
  my point is why are n't the countries where diversity and mass migration from outside of europe is accepted and propagated as a highly positive change fighting to get more quotas for themselves and happy that they can take any such refused by the visegrad ? 
  if x is highly positive , then when someone refuses his allocated share of x it is logical that i will be glad to take it off of him , rather than force him . 
  who threatens to punish someone for not taking in something which is highly positive ? 
  that makes no sense .
