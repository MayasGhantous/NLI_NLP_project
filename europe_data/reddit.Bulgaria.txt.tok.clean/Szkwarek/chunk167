  you sound like quite the racist for constantly blaming my country for the information i give here on ngo 's smuggling people into italy . 
  like you think we live in north korea and all we say or think is put there by the government . 
  in reality , these are the sources of my claims , feel free to keep ignoring them out of embarassment and attack my country instead : https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/27/ngo-rescues-off-libya-encourage-traffickers-eu-borders-chief http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/23/italy-prosecutor-says-rescue-boats-contact-people-smugglers/ http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/refugee-boat-rescue-charities-medicins-sans-frontieres-save-the-children-mediterranean-sea-migrants-a7699571.html https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/04/are-we-helping-desperate-migrants-or-just-people-smugglers/ http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-eu-libya-idukkbn1881cq?feedtype=rss&amp;feedname=worldnews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=feed%3a+reuters%2fukworldnews+%28news+%2f+uk+%2f+world+news%29&amp;utm_content=google+uk, 
  lol now you ' r getting pathetic mate . 
  i already acknowledged asking for quotas could be legal , and made points that it nevertheless means you are asking other countries to help solve your own unwillingness or inability to do something as simple as enforce your own sovereign borders . 
  you are being crass at the ukrainians to `` sort their own problem '' - which is a foreign army of a global power , but you yourself ca n't sort your own problem - a bunch of pathetic ngo 's and boats . 
  that 's the point you are now in panic mode to avoid so keep repeating the link you put on the dublin treaty . 
  edit : stop changing your original posts and add sentences after i answerd to them . 
  it 's pathetic . 
  this was your entire post when you first submitted it :  what ? 
  i provided documented evidence that your points are nonsense . 
  you made no point nor refuted any of mine with this statement . 
  the reality is that the eu is not a country , but a set of sovereign states . 
  each state has the responsiblity to guard its borders . 
  if you fail , that 's your fucking fault and by any standard , moral or legal , you should fix your own mess . 
  you are n't an open yard for all to walk into , you are a state . 
  it 's about time you act like one instead of whine and bitch for others to help you , but the hypocritically yourself tell the ukrainians they should `` take care of their own problems and not drag others into them '' . 
  you are doing the exact same thing with your inaction against the ngo 's ferrying thousands of migrants to your shores - a much , much easier problem to solve than a russian-backed army occupying part of your country . 
  and yet you would bitch to other states for help with such an easy problem like a few dozen ngo boats smuggling people , but have the audacity to tell the ukrainians they ca n't ask for help with a much serious problem ? 
  pathetic , truly . 
  precisely said union has an agreement which italy signed , called the dublin accord , by which all illigal migrants are returned to the country of first entry . 
  it is you who are trying to wiggle your way out of this agreement by forcing `` migrant quotas '' through brussels on the rest of the members , who do not want them nor should they pay for your inability to guard your own borders or stop the ngos that ferry migrants on an industrial scale from the libyan coast to your borders . 
  hence the comparison is quite valid - a country asking for help with a border problem it is unable or unwilling to solve itself , despite no legal requirements of those others to help it . 
   please solve your ** migration crisis ** yourself italy and do n't drag the rest of us into it . 
  you like it like that ? 
  who is `` the us '' and `` russia '' ? 
  people ? 
  biological objects or geo-political structures who have varying leaders at the head ? 
  how reluctant or not `` russia '' or `` the us '' are depends on who is the current leader . 
  there has n't yet been a leader in both these countries to jeopardize the nuclear deterrent by saying they are `` reluctant '' to use it . 
  logically , since it would make the respective nuclear arsenals useless . 
  i will play devil 's advocate . 
  the point of having nuclear weapons is as a deterrent against other nuclear powers or powerful militaries , not to use it in a nuclear holocaust . 
  however , it can only actually work as a deterrent to said potential enemies if they think you are willing to use it . 
  if they know you would n't , it 's as if you do n't have it . 
  hence for the leader of a nuclear power to say he is reluctant to use it equals him basically scrapping the geo-political and deference/deterrence potential of the nuclear arsenal . 
  people saw these remarks by corbyn , a potential leader of a nuclear power , as dangerously eroding the deterrence capabilities of the uk should he come to power , for the sake of left-wing , populist virtue signalling . 
  i believe this alludes to him wanting to surrender the british nuclear capabilities , not `` to surrender in a nuclear war '' . 
  i do not comment on corbyn himself , i am a right winger myself and oppose marxists like him quite strongly . 
  i just comment on the utter trash the sun is , which is something that should make right wingers like myself rather ashamed if we ca n't criticize pathetic marxists better than this . 
   you mean better than getting flooded by bulgarians ? 
  like western europe ? 
  yes , 1 million bulgarian immigrants in the entire world out of the tiny 7 million nation have flooded countries . 
  :d it 's precisely the same as 1 billion africa quadrupling in population by 2100 , according to the un . 
  you are a pathetic troll that posts nothing but weak attempts at offending eastern europeans cause you think it is somehow a good argument for mass african and muslim migration into europe that you seem fond of . 
  you ' v been called out numerous times and always just run away immediately like a rat . 
  like with me again only a few days ago : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6fflmq/refusing_islamic_migrants_is_only_way_of_ensuring/diiu2kh/, 
  true , but the millionaire ca n't force you to buy and read it , so unless society willingly eats that shit up it 's nothing but wasted money from the millionaire . 
  the british certainly eat it up to give it such a high circulation over all other papers . 
  the level of media in a free , capitalist society is indicative of the level of the public . 
  if no one would buy this garbage in the british society then no one would produce it and be forced by the hand of the market to offer higher quality content . 
  instead , it 's the most sold british paper ... 
  better them than us . 
  because there is no such thing as `` a fair share '' - those are people not fucking potatoes , they do n't want to stay in poland or hungary , they want to go to germany or sweden or france . 
  and that 's precisely what all refugees taken by the eastern states have done - packed up and left . 
  it would be hilarious if western liberals ended up , in their great compassion and love , advocating for locking people up against their will so a quota can be fulfilled by a given country . 
  why should i stop complaining about muslims moving into europe ? 
  give me a single good reason making europe worse is something i should n't complain about . 
  that 's great then , problem solved . 
  2000 migrants a month is nothing . 
  give em all to germany even , it 's like a drop in the bucket for a country of 80 million people . 
  why is the picture being painted of `` an overflowing '' eu with refugees that is being abandoned by the vishegrad 4 ? 
  obviously there 's only a tiny number of circa 2000 migrants coming to greece , surely large liberal countries like germany , france or spain can take them all in without having to force any onto the vishegrad 4 ? 
  no , they ca n't travel to europe because it takes far too long , they are only capable of doing so because they are being ferried by ngo 's who pick them up a few kilometres from the libyan coast . 
  without these ngo 's not 95 % of them would be able to get all the way to lampedusa or sicily from the libyan coast . 
  outlawing the criminal ngo 's that work directly with the african smugglers and sending the fleets there will put a permanent stop to any mass migration and flow of people from africa . 
  assistance does n't equal ferrying people to europe and keeping them there . 
  put those sinking on the military ship , ferry them to the libyan coast and off you go . 
  they will quickly stop trying if the eu keeps doing this . 
  instead they know they will be picked up by ngo boats and ferried straight into eu coast , from whence taken over with open arms . 
  are greece and italy pushing the eu towards such a solution that ensures a common push of the wave out of europe , or are they just pushing to relocate the entering migrants further into the eu ? 
  why should europe choose between hurting its common , overall good and geo-political strenght by either accepting millions of muslims or by appeasing russia ? 
  why ca n't it have a harsh , independent stance on both issues - deter russia from continental expansion as well as close borders to muslim migrants and forcefully return them to the coasts of lybia or syria using its navy ? 
  you ferry them right off to the coast of libya the vast majority came from . 
  i assure you there is not `` sovereign state '' of libya to send a navy to prevent that . 
  if they choose to . 
  every country belongs to those who are a demographic majority inside of it and they decide whom to welcome into their lands . 
  definitely . 
  and regardless if the religion they follow is islam , christianity , buddhism , or antifa , marxism , neonazism etc. 
  do you disagree that a basic pre-requisite to belong to the christian faith , and therefore a christian church , is to consciously accept jesus christ as god ? 
  do you claim that a majority of the swedish population consciously accept jesus christ as god ? 
  i already asked you if most swedes believed in christianity or they did n't . 
  you said they did n't ( most swedes give a rat 's ass about religion . 
  ) , now you say most of them are `` secular protestants '' . 
  you keep contradicting yourself . 
  i did n't count `` the fundamentalists '' towards the protestant church of sweden , i count the regular , believing christian . 
  the one who says christ is his god and the bible his teaching . 
  if that is fundamentalist to you and a person who `` gives a rat 's ass about religion '' is a regular christian , then you have some very , very misguided idea of what a religion is and who its adherents are . 
   lol but all the poor eastern europeans can come in ? 
  your entitlement is bizarre come into their own countries ? 
  yes , they are born there . 
  your trolling is moronic . 
  why should they be ? 
  with a quadrupling population of africa untill 2100 and horrible climate change effects there might as well be up to half a billion people in need of help there this century . 
  it does n't mean europeans should fundamentally let their continent be transformed demographically because of it . 
  are you trolling ? 
   `` most swedes give a rat 's ass about religion . '', 
   `` i 'm just saying the swedish church is n't practically non-existent demographically . '', 
  these two are contradictory statements . 
  from what i understand from swedes the church autmatically puts you as its member and people do n't bother singning out , but in reality the churches are all but empty and probably less than 10 % of those members are actively part of the church , same as in england .
