  accountants . 
  then your government does n't have the right to pretend to `` defend european values '' if it uses its monopoly over violence to punish its citizens for expressing certain ( any , in fact ) political views . 
  this was the core of classical european liberalism and something western europe fails at . 
  i have yet to see a single case of a person punished for it in bulgaria since 1989 , or most of eastern europe . 
  ( although we have our growing wave of `` pink fascists '' here as well ), 
  yep , the contrary to having your home [ raided by the government ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36804363 ) because you expressed an opinion on facebook . 
  nope , i talk of zero governmental crackdown on ideological expression either here , or in most places in eastern europe . 
  all the while your governments [ raid people 's homes over facebook posts . 
  ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36804363 ) the same governments who then talk of `` defending europe 's values '' . 
  i had the opportunity `` looking into it '' when i actually * lived it * . 
  something you were privileged enough not to . 
  no , did i claim this is it ? 
  the causality of poland and other similar countries being devastated by the socialist experiment is not something i 'm adding here . 
  it 's a well established historical and economic fact . 
  did the market-based ruthless dictatorial regimes of franco or pinochet leave their respective countries as thoroughly devastated ? 
  or is chille in fact the richest south american state today , whilst spain even with franco you can see above compared to socialist poland . 
  many dictatorships came and went throughout history , but few destroy a society so thoroughly as those who added to this the factor of abolition of capitalism and implementation of socialism , communism , marxism , maoism etc. 
  every opinion on art or music is irrational , as those are subjective and relative . 
  why do you tell yourself that your liking of the bland pop on eurovision is any more `` rational '' than my disliking ? 
  how was i at any given point `` an asshole '' to you ? 
  i argued 100 % about the contest only and did n't adress you personally at all until your previous comment that did that to me . 
  i know i know , [ it was never * real socialism * ] ( https://pics.me.me/when-your-retarded-system-collapses-but-its-okay-because-it-6604062.png ) . 
  i make an objective assessment of eurovision , you get emotional . 
  if you like it so much learn to handle ciriticism rather than getting butthurt . 
  `` here '' is a subreddit about europe , not about eurovision - a single , shitty pop-song contest . 
  i have no reason to stay away from topics on r/europe if i dislike this constest , as many seem to do in the comments . 
  r/europe is not meant exclusively for 14-18 year old girls or gays , as is eurovision 's chief demographic audience . 
  if you ca n't see it how are you in position to criticize others for shitting on eu values ? 
  if you accept the governmental crackdown on freedom of expression in western europe as something normal , i do n't think you are in a position to point fingers . 
  the [ source is this article ] ( https://leakofnations.com/poland-continues-its-rise-from-the-ashes-of-communism-poland-economic-growth/ ) which i took from this [ thread . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bcj7v/poland_continues_its_rise_from_the_ashes_of/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ), 
  the title uses the accepted historical name of that period in eastern europe in accordance with the official name used by those states themsleves . 
  personal opinions are irrelevant in that regard , the period is know and will remain know officially as `` socialism '' in eastern europe , i use it precisely to avoid any debates on semantics . 
  the [ source is this article ] ( https://leakofnations.com/poland-continues-its-rise-from-the-ashes-of-communism-poland-economic-growth/ ) which i literary took from this [ same subreddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6bcj7v/poland_continues_its_rise_from_the_ashes_of/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=europe ) . 
  units in the article , i ' v put the source as a separate comment , thank you for your contribution . 
  you make a valid point and perhaps it is irrelevant how they called themsleves to how we define them . 
  what is relevant is what they did and i , as well as quite a serious number of socialists themselves , do recognize many of their actions as socialist in spirit and goal . 
  whereas i doubt any , even remotely supportive of democracy person in the entire world recognizes north korea as a democratic country . 
  and what is the reaction from the `` defenders of eu values '' in the west ? 
  the same germans , french , dutch etc. 
  who constantly whine of eastern european nationalism ? 
  none ? 
  ahh yes , of course , because praising the mass murderers of marxism is not even remotely as bad as being a nationalist who opposes arab migrants for example ... 
  of course . 
  is there remotely any democracy or its tennants in korea ? 
  were there plenty of socialism 's goals , at least as deifined by marx , in these countries ? 
  yes . 
  from collecitivsation and nationalisation , to welfare , abolishing banks , capitalists , free market etc. 
  of course one can make the case they were socialist as many socialists themselves , including today , still do . 
  if you are a socialist who disagrees turn to the plenty of your fellow socialists praising these states to this day as examples . 
  my blood boils when i hear privileged marxists from countries that avoided that fate tell me something like that after how much my family lost in 1944 and subsequently . 
  planned economy with restricted or removed private property and business rights , called by those who implemented it socialism * i deal with the official names of historic periods or countries to avoid discussions over semantics . 
  it was officially the union of soviet * socialist * republics , not communist , and so was the system defined in its satellites . 
  in statistical analysis the one time exception does not negate the common rule , on the contrary . 
  eurovision is 99 % extremely bland , shitty , samey , gay and teenage girl appeasing pop trash songs . 
  1 % others , like the one that won in 2006 . 
  the rule is the majority , not the exception . 
  the eu values , such as free expression , freedom from political censorship or the state imposing political ideologies on its citizens are far more shat upon by western countries , especially yours . 
  whereas ee countries are far , far closer to the classical european liberalism view on freedom and political/social discourse , with no one fearing his life might be ruined if he expressed `` the wrong '' ideas or attitudes , like you do in the west/north . 
  then you seem completely unaware of what eurovision is or have never heard of it prior to this year . 
   class enemies were deported much more frequently , as opposed to killed . 
  or simply had their means of production nationalised . 
  that 's so reassuring , thank you - they will merely ruin my life , my life 's work and my entire family , as opposed to kill me !, 
  how much better , now i want them to legally spread their ideology !, 
  i do . 
  can i oppose mass afro-asian influx of migrants , many of whom have already set up a ghetto in the center of my home town ? 
  ( behind halite , sofia ), 
  since when does christianity preach killing non-believers ? 
  provide some sources or correct the bs you wrote . 
  you have difficulties understanding why a gay-looking , feminine teenager 's shitty pop-song was liked on ... eurovision ? 
  salazar did nothing wrong . 
  it can only be better if they make the vaccines mandatory and circumcision illegal . 
  because there 's no fighting fascism like ... being a fascist . 
  i thought it was precisely the anglosphere where pro-capitalist governments were cutting state spending , whilst their counterparts increased the state 's role and surveillence , like the democrats in the us for example with the nsa and obama being the president who persecuted most whistleblowers statistically out of any previous one . 
  they literary changed their language artificially in the 19th century by taking italian and french words en mass to make it more like yours . 
  arguably between 20 % and 40 % of their modern lexis are recent borrowings from italian and french :  in the 19th century , the romanian lexis was severely re-romanized by importing words from latin , italian , and to the greatest extent , french . 
  many of these words served to replace slavic words which were thought inappropriate by many romanian patriots of that time . 
  how do ultra-capitalist and \u201e surveillance regime '' go together ? 
  ultra-capitalists , so basically all market-radicals like the libertarians or anarcho-capitalists argue for a minimal state , maximum personal freedom and no taxes . 
  they are rabidly against a surveillance regime or any amount of large government , which is what usually the left , anti-capitalists argue for . 
  you get me very wrong my friend . 
  i never said i wanted to ally with you or need your votes . 
  you should 've stopped the quotation after cancer . 
  marxism is a cancer on every single society , the ideology that destroyed the most countries and people in the 20th century , and one which has to be eradicated by any means necessary before any other , including fascism . 
  first you die , then the rest of us unite against the fascists , it 's that simple , no one needs you . 
  you do n't get it , it was never `` real communists/marxists '' who did it all throughout the 20th century , on 5 continents and dozens of countries . 
  it was always `` fake communists '' . 
  but these guys today , they are the * real * ones , the only who know exactly how to do it if you only give them the chance to ... 
  do n't pretend you 're not a marxist trying to normalise the disease that is the far left . 
  your comment history is n't hidden . 
  ah yes , the perpetual `` not true marxists '' argument of each next marxist generation about the previous one , as they keep destroying country after country and never achieve even a single successful society . 
  marxism is a disease and a threat to every nation . 
  period . 
  to oppose the disease that is marxism , which has destroyed dozens of countries around the world , including mine , is to be a normal , sane person with basic knowledge of history , not a trump supporter . 
  your worldview and political spectrum encompasses nothing but either dumb , cronyist populism like trump or disgusting marxism ? 
  i pity you . 
  i love privileged , spoiled kids from the first world like your country playing at `` marxists '' . 
  or maybe they like having a nation , with its unique culture , identity and traditions , as opposed to a `` progressive '' / leftist mess . 
  it 's even harder to wrap one 's mind around the reality of marxists existing in the 21st century and their social disease still having any relevance whatsoever . 
  back to r/fullcommunism with you , there 's nothing worse than normalising the far left and the marxist disease , not even le pen or her fascist idiots would be as bad or as devastating as the red plague that people like you spew from your parents ' basements .
