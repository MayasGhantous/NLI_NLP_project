  furthermore , large cities have always been more susceptible to falling for marxism , as we see with melenchon 's results . 
  i understand you perfectly , as we unfortunately have the same scum praising communism/marxism and using pretty much the same arguments you mentioned , about our communist dictatorship . 
  they are , thankfully , dying out quickly and the new generation is a lot more right wing and capitalist . 
   edit : was it fascist or marxist scum that got butthurt by my comment against dictatorship ? 
  people assimilated massively inside rome and adopted the roman identity , language and religion/s . 
  when the same happens in europe it 's wonderful . 
  let more people in who will assimilate , primarily south americans and east asians . 
  do n't let those who never assimilate , not even after 4 or 5 generations , due to a massive obstacle that is the proto-fascist arab political ideology invented in the 7th century . 
  lol what , we are having a perfectly reasonable debate on history started by your wrong , and to some certainly offensive comment about bulgarian military history , and when presented with thorough facts of how wrong you are it is suddenly mean ? 
  grow up , learn to be wrong and to own it instead of crying `` mean '' . 
  grabbing land in the south though , at that time eastern roman empire , was the most difficult task in the world as this was the most advanced , populated and rich states in the world . 
  yet the bulgarians conquered everything from the danube to the aegean sea , all the way into thessaly , and even besieged the imperial capital - and most populous and rich city in the world , a few times . 
  in [ 680 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_ongal ) , in [ 811 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_pliska ) , in [ 917 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_achelous_ ( 917 ) ) and a few other occasions the entire army of the eastern roman empire , all of its themata and the emperor himself , met the bulgarians in battle and were completely anahilated . 
  the bulgarians remain as the people who killed most roman emperors in battle during the 1400 years of the empire 's existance . 
  in 717 on the other hand the bulgars saved constiantinople , and basically europe , [ from the main arab invasion ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_constantinople_ ( 717 % e2 % 80 % 93718 ) ) of more than 100,000 people , with the bulgarians slaughtering 30,000 arabs in the very fist day accoriding to the contemporary sources . 
  in 804 they destroyed an entire kingdom in the middle of europe , the [ avar khaganate ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/avar_khaganate ) , which bulgaria 's ruler krum conquered and famously brought most of the nobility back to bulgaria . 
  when have the serbs or croat managed to do anything remotely similar in those days , let alone wage as many massive wars , against the largest empires of the time , in battles with more than 40,000 soldiers on each side , besiege imperial capitals or destroy entire kingdoms ? 
  both the serbs and croats had small , unimpressive medieval states , with the serbs making a bit larger one during the reign of a single ruler in the 14th century . 
  [ only possible argument you can make when you ca n't give an example of a single society where your ideology has n't brought utter destruction and misery in the end . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reductio_ad_absurdum ), 
  no , it would 've been best if you guys did n't steal lands from all of your neighbours . 
  is there a serbian neighbour that has n't had its people as minority inside serbia at some point because belgrade took part of its lands ? 
  we and the hungarians still do . 
  meanwhile , i ca n't think of a serb minority region in bulgaria . 
  or in hungary , or in romania ... it 's almost like belgrade was the main expansionist in the balkans last century , but complains when this is reversed ... 
  create one working , moneyless , stateless , classless , propertyless society that does n't descend into murderous and oppressive dictatorship before it collapses , and then you have the right to speak . 
  until then , marxists have brought nothing but utter destruction and suffering to the world by trying , and failing every single time , to achieve their desired society . 
  with every next generation of marxists believing it is exclusively * them * who know how to do it . 
  none of which as compact and at the same time distinct as those of europe . 
  the difference between the population of new york state and that of ohio is incomparable to that of spain and ireland for example , or romania and england , or germany and italy , or poland and france , etc. 
  there is a single language , a single national identity and very much a single culture in the us . 
  nothing like that in europe , and no way of it ever happening . 
  like the previous post said , every federation in history made up of so distinct and different nations and identities as in europe has always collapsed . 
  the us does n't even come close to a federation of such distinctiveness of its various states like between the countries of europe . 
  the us is a very diverse nation state , not a federation of distinct , unique , and very different nations and countries like europe would be . 
  you still seem unable to grasp the difference between countries and civilizations waging actual , conventional warfare of conquest between eachother ... and sectarian violence ( current jihadism ) , which is far more directed towards other muslims than towards the christian world . 
  you do realize jihadism today kills 99 % other muslims , not christians , right ? 
  then how can its cause be `` a christian aggression '' or it a response to such ? 
  it is n't , it 's merely the attempt at imposing a particular version of islam ( wahabism ) -- hence why it is mainly fought against other , non-wahabi , muslims . 
  it 's an internal sectarian war that occasionally spills out onto non-muslims , but remains at least 99 % a murder of muslims against muslims for the sake of an intra-religious reformation . 
  you are trying to compare that to actual , convetional armies of muslims invading and conquering 2/3 of a neighbouring civilization , and then this civilization finally launching a united counter-attack with its own , convetional armies . 
  tell me , if the crusades should n't have happened what should have been done ? 
  what would you have the christian civilization do at the time ? 
  just stay passive and disunited like it did for the past 4 centuries prior and let itself be conqured and destroyed ? 
  for 4 centuries it did nothing , each christian region under the attack of the islamic world defended itself and easily fell one by one . 
  you would have the remaining chrisitan world follow the same fate , because your stuck up , arrogant 21st century soul ca n't possible justify `` horrible religious violence '' . 
  you would have these millions of christians back then just give up and passively wait as the islamic civilizations strikes their regions one by one and easily overcomes them , as opposed to them banding together to strike back at it . 
  you are asking for an entire civilization to have just given up because organized resistance is to you `` disgusting '' . 
  that 's the pinnacle of a 21st century , privileged arrogance of someone who 's world is n't actively being conquered . 
  you get to live a secure , peaceful life that does n't worry about an army of muslims taking over your entire country tomorrow , yet that is precisely what the chrisitans in europe lived with back in the 11th century , besieged for the previous 4 centuries , until they had enough and stroke back . 
  and history proved them right , because as soon as the crusades ended , europe was immediately back to being besieged and conquered by the muslims for the next 4 centuries , with numerous nations such as mine falling under muslim occupation for centuries - something that would n't have happened had the crusades succeeded . 
  no , because they belive only * they * know exactly how to achieve it . 
  all those previous attempts were not * true * attempts , by impostors . 
  they are certain if they can lead a revolution all those ideas they have will be implemented and by no means will they be quickly cleansed by the radical and scruples murderers within their ranks who would then proceed to do the exact same thing that happened in every single 20th century communist takeover . 
  they are , simply , delusional and na\u00efve . 
  `` france '' is not just an economy or a state , it 's above all else a people , a culture with history and identity back more than 1000 years . 
  hence france can only be destroyed when those are gone . 
  its indigenous people who represent the history and culture of those lands for more than 1000 years . 
  those are threatened by replacement with almost 10 % already replaced by african communities in a blink of history , barely 4 decades . 
  hence , the only way to `` save '' france at the moment is to save it from what has been going on for 4 decades . 
  to save its demographic destiny . 
  all else is secondary . 
  which candidate addresses this most important battle for france as a nation , a history , a culture , an identity ? 
  lol look at all those downvotes . 
  this subreddit is filled with easily butthurt , stuck-up kids . 
  what is the permanent solution ? 
  communist and marxists are an insult to any sane , educated person who does not want to see the western world , the greatest civilization ever built , completely destroyed by an ideology that openly aims the destruction of all of its main pillars and achievements - private property , individualism , rule of law , meritocracy , familial structure , democracy , national structure , capitalism and many more that traditional marxism , as well as modern `` intersectionalist '' one , want gone , as they perceive them as `` structures of oppression '' and obstacles to a completely classless , stateless , moneyless , communal society . 
  to be a communist/marxist ( of the traditional type , not just a stalinist or maoist ) is to be a hate-driven person who wishes to destroy humanity 's greatest civilization in pursuit of a world system that is neither achievable , nor desirable or just , were it to be achievable in the first place . 
  large cities is where the academia , the `` champaign socialists '' and the privileged , middle class kids who want to be `` rebels '' are , all three of which produce marxist useful idiots . 
  plenty of studies have shown that organisations like antifa have a disproportionate percentage of young , unemployed people from the middle class , living with their parents . 
  that 's a large cities phenomenon . 
  you are confounding as equals a premise and a historical fact . 
  the premise of islamic jihadists today is that there is a christian conquest of the muslim world , yet i fail to see 2/3 of it currently occupied by christian countries , with their armies spread around it and imposing christianity onto the millions of local muslims . 
  this is precisely what the islamic conquests were and how they completely destroyed and de-christianized 2/3 of the christian world in the middle ages . 
  it is an actual fact of history that the islamic conquests happened and thus the crusaders were , in fact , an actual counter-attack against an actual , actively ongoing massive conquest of the christian world . 
  the `` conquest of the muslim world '' that the jihadists today may be using as an excuse is , on the other hand , an entirely fabricated , made up lie . 
  there are no european or christian armies occupying 2/3 of all muslim lands today as there were muslim ones doing that to the christian world in the middles ages . 
  you are trying to claim a civilization under centuries of aggression and active conquest had no right to strike back . 
  it should have just given up and let itself be completely conquered , because the alternative is `` a disgusting religious war '' . 
  thankfully for us in europe , including you , our ancestors were not as spineless and morally arrogant as you are , and actively fought against the islamic world , so the western civilization can end up being built and prosper in a free and secular europe today , whilst practically all muslim societies are stuck in the mid ages . 
  they happened in the context of a world at war between two civilizations , one of which ( the islamic ) was invading and attacking the other one ( christian ) for 4 centuries straight , conquering 2/3 of its lands and continuing its assault until the crusades began as a counterattack aimed at giving the christian world a bit of a respite . 
  as soon as they ended the islamic invasion continued , with the ottomans reaching the center of europe 4 centuries later . 
  the crusades are the equivalent of a guy who was attacked and punched repeatedly for 4 hours , finally throwing a few punches back . 
  ( and then going back to being punched for another 4 hours ) currently no european conquest of the middle east , no christianisation of millions of muslims there or imposition of european languages takes place , for it to be the equivalent of the islamic conquest of the christian middle east , north africa , spain and the balkans which triggered the crusades . 
  what the jihadists want at the moment is a triumphant conquest of islam for the entire world . 
  what the crusaders wanted was merely to return of a few tiny lands the muslims had taken ( palestine ) , and a stop to the endless islamic aggression against the christian world which began in the 7th century and ripped out the most populous and advanced 2/3 of it . 
  ( mid east , egypt , n africa , anatolia , sicily , spain ), 
  i do . 
  it 's where i keep muh national sovereignty . 
  u wot m8 ? 
  the list of [ bulgarian wars ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_bulgaria ) is lit with green for victory . 
  victories that made an [ empire bigger than ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_bulgarian_empire ) croatia or serbia have ever been . 
  [ twice ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bulgarian_empire ) i will bash ya head in i swear on me mum you cheeky croat . 
  hungary , romania , croatia , bulgaria and albania are actually far more historically and ethnically accurate here . 
  you are the best greek . 
  ** edit ** : the above comment was entirely changed after i wrote him my reply . 
  it was at first something like `` we do n't need freedom-fighters , we need more european integration '' , hence my response deals with this , not the subsequently changed comment of his . 
  ______________________________________________ integrated does n't equal a single superstate with a completely unaccountable central power and regions that are basically voiceless and powerless with their few delegates they send to this unaccountable capital . 
  i am all for a united europe , as were in fact the nationalists of the 19th century such as mazzini . 
  a europe of self-governing nations and regions , which have united geo-politically and militarily to fend off any outside great powers .
