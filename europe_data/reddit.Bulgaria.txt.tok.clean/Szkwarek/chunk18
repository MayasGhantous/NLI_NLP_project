  they have slavic and greek words too , it 's the normal process throughout history , your question makes no sense . 
  `` that matters '' in what ? 
  some ranking ? 
  some competition ? 
  the purpose of tourism is n't so you can be `` better '' and `` more '' than your neighbour , it 's to support your economy . 
  the more you can get relative to your economy the better . 
  1 million tourists is n't the same in each country - it 's a lot in montenegro , and nothing in china . 
  so numbers are n't the same when different countries are looked at . 
  it 's per capita that really shows how strong the tourist sector is in a country . 
  greece beats turkey 4 times per capita , meaning tourism there is more developped and can bring more money for each citizen . 
  that 's what matters to the greeks who benefit from it , not if turkey or someone else has more overall . 
  only dickhead nationalists who think it 's all about competition of numbers might think this . 
  and even they should rather look at per capita . 
  22 million for greece 40 million for turkey greece has a population of 11 million and 130 thousand sq. 
  that 's two tourists per inhabitant and 20 million per 100 thousand sq. 
  turkey has 77 million people and 783 thousand sq. 
  that 's 4 times less than greece as proportion - half a tourist per inhabitant and 20 million per 390 thousand sq. 
  the concentration and effectivness of tourism is 4 times bigger in greece than in turkey .

  hey guys are we having a meeting or smth ? 
  sooo , what 's with the shitty wheather lately ? 
  no , but i wonder why you assume this one in turkey is a random bombing ? 
  more than a hundred years ago . 
  sure , entirely possible . 
  as much as it 's possible teens love attention and it 's quite fashionable to have an `` alternative '' sexuality today , rather than the `` boring '' , `` traditional '' hetero . 
  but i might just be wrong , after all who 's heard of young people faking identities and belonging to groups for attention , right ? 
  but it can be if you fake it for attention . 
  it 's not a phase mooom !, 
  can anyone explain to me why it 's happening right now ? 
  there are n't much more conflicts in africa and asia than in previous decades , yet the wave seems to get bigger and bigger ? 
  `` livable '' is very subjective . 
  i ' v lived in burssels and hated it entirely , from the shitty wheather and dirty streets to the `` demographic '' of certain downtown neighbourhoods or the `` artificial '' and `` lifeless '' feeling of my neighbourhood next to the commission . 
  compared to that my current town - sofia , is full of parks , sunny wheather and smiling young europeans on the streets . 
  i ' v never once here been looked at whilst waking down the street holding my girlfriend 's hand the way i was in schaerbeek . 
  because poland 's emmissions are a drop in the sea compared to the giants of china or the us , yet they are asked to sacrifice far more of their economy to make a difference in world-wide emmissions that the above mentioned can make ten times over by reducing a percentage their economies would barely feel . 
  you ca n't ask the poorer to make larger personal sacrifices with smaller overall result . 
  i say we 're above greece . 
  and they think i mean it geographically . 
  i agree with this definitely , it 's the other areas of the map that look a bit dodgy . 
  northern poland had far more people than serbia for example and so did central lithuania and western ruthenia . 
  because romania is most certainly also a mountanous country , with the vast carpathian mountains dominating its geography and a number of smaller mountains spread out across transylvania . 
  being more northern they also ought to have more denser forests , less forest fires and more frequent plains forests . 
  i 'd say the difference comes from the fact greece has participated in the eu-wide reforestation over the past decades , whilst romania ( and bulgaria ) are barely now starting it , with huge problems due to illegal logging at that . 
  it 's thus due to state differences rather than country ones . 
  that map looks strange on a number of places . 
  ireland certainly was n't more populous than england , yet it has a larger area with the same density shown . 
  in the commonwealth rhutenia had areas as densely populated as poland , which was actually more populated to the [ north ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/the_density_of_the_urban_network_per_voivodeship_of_polish%e2%80%93lithuanian_commonwealth_ca._1650_%28eng%29.png ) than shown here south , and both of which were certainly denser than serbia , here shown with more . 
  demographic crisis never before seen , coupled with large ethnic and muslim minorities having the only positive fertility rates . 
  their army is what held the country together and it has never had such a large percentage of muslims in it , with predictions to increase indefinitely . 
  only russians going back to replacement rates can save them from becoming a majority of elderly people in a country with young and vibrant minorities ever more confident to take over their lands . 
  it was entirely far fetched at the time of the proposal and a certain death sentance with the third reich in full control of the continent . 
  we avoided loosing more than a million people like the serbs or 6 million like the polish precisely by aligning ourselves with the axis . 
  it was the best choice they could ' v done . 
  i just regret they did n't invite the western allies to use our ports for a second front in 1944 before the red army came to occupy us . 
  we 'd have both avoided the third reich 's genocide and the ussr 's occupation/75 year decaying influence . 
  both sides bribed the government and the monarchy . 
  they were both trying to get bulgaria on their side , but the promises of the entante we weaker . 
  they envisioned a conference after the war where bulgaria would negotiate with serbia over parts of macedonia under the arbitration of the great powers of the entante . 
  the central powers on the other hand just said `` go and get it '' . 
  so their argument was a bit more convincing evne without any additional bribes . 
  they are n't `` stressing '' it to make a point , they mention it in all media , not just german , because it 's a fact about the country , that puts the particular piece of news in perspective . 
  when one says `` the poorest state in the eu '' it means the one with the smallest median wage and gdp per capita , not that we are `` poor '' as in not having what to eat or wear . 
  it 's a comperative definition , not a pejorative one . 
  they are n't saying we are poor , but that we are the poorest in the eu . 
  which is a fact . 
  the point is to put into perspective the choice of for example these guys , who did n't immigrate to the richest states as 99 % of immigrants do , but to the poorest one . 
  it creates a comparrison and that 's the point of mentioning it , wheras you accept it like a sulking kid that thinks `` these bad germans constantly stress that we are poor to make us look bad '' . 
  which is both an uniformed and a very childish attitude . 
  same as your last sentance . 
  who the hell uses stuff like `` mr. ( something you talked about ) '' outside of elementary school ? 
  * that 's * why i said you are emabarassing . 
  we were n't following `` the powers of the day '' or `` switchin sides '' . 
  we were following a pretty straithforward idea - uniting the country with macedonia . 
  we waged war with however held the region and allied with their enemies . 
  that 's why we fought in the second balkan war . 
  that 's why we fought in ww1 on germany 's side , since it was against serbia . 
  ( holding mac ) same in ww2 . 
  we fought till the end in all those wars and only in ww2 did the country switch sides after it had been occupied by the red army and forced to do so by its puppet communist regime . 
  utter bollocks . 
  almost every sentance . 
  do you think california or missippi , or germany or greece are like people , buddies that choose to `` act stupid '' or `` do n't care , as long as they help '' ? 
  it sounds like the thought process of a 5 year old . 
  try and read some macroeconomics rather than think of countries as single , anthropomorphic entities that act like kids on a playground . 
  it embarasses all of us . 
  no problem mate . 
  i do n't know why so many people are confused about this . 
  probably because it is called `` cyrillic '' , after cyrill . 
  but you are wrong , it was n't developped by cyrill and methodius and there is n't really a historical debate about this , just general confusion , like with the viking horns i guess . 
  cyrill and methodius developped what is known as the [ glagolithic alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_alphabet ) . 
  it [ looks ] ( http://www.crystalinks.com/glagolitic2.gif ) very much nothing like the cyrillic . 
  at the end of cyril 's life he was given sanctuary by the bulgarian tzar and allowed to teach the alphabet to students of his choosing . 
  after his death those students of his continued to work at the [ preslav literary school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/preslav_literary_school ) , funded by the bulgarian crown , and try and come up with an alphabet that suits the bulgarian slavic language letter-for-sound , which is why it is such today . 
  they developped the [ early cyrillic alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_cyrillic_alphabet ) there and named it after their teacher - cyrill . 
  it is the alphabet we use today and call `` cyrillic '' , as you can [ see ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/%d0%90%d0%b7%d0%b1%d1%83%d0%ba%d0%b0.jpg ) if you know it . 
  it is developped by bulgarian scholars , in the bulgarian capital , at the bulgarian literary school , funded by the bulgarian monarch , in the first bulgarian empire and with the purpose to fit the bulgarian language letter-for-sound . 
  but because they had a greek teacher they named it after greeks say it 's theirs , and because russians use it and they are a bigger nation they say it is theirs .
