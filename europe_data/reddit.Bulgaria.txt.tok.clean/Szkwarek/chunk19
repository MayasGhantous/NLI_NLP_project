  that 's what we have to deal with . 
  how come the greeks `` literally constructed '' the cyrillic ? 
  i do n't think you are aware of its origins to write something like that . 
  just a random boat ? 
  that was leisurely floating along the sea ? 
  taking tourists out ? 
  or fishing ? 
  what was the boat doing ? 
  the bolsheviks did n't target individual enemies , but social . 
  they branded entire social groups as worthy of elimination and proceeded to exterminate them . 
  people were as responsible for beinb born in a family of free peasants ( kulaks ) , or artisians , or teachers , or doctors , or military , or capitalists , or bourgeoisie , as much as in a family of jews or gypsies . 
  there 's therefore zero difference between the nazis exterminating all born within the particular ethnic group and the soviets exterminating all born within the particular social group . 
  it 's the same thing because it targets entire groups of millions of people based on factors they mostly did n't determine . 
  sure , a kulak can stop being a kulak by selling his land and becoming a poor worker , but then again a jew can also rename himself , renounce judaism , destroy all papers proving his jewish roots and become a german , or french , or polish . 
  so do n't try making it sound as if nazis and soviets had a different degrees of mass murder - it was the same - entire social strata , millions of people , no personal/individual guilt in the victims of either . 
  then again , those are actual facts about the nature of the soviet regime and i 'm yet to see someone identifying as an anarchist to ever face such facts without trying to whitewash them . 
  it 's just in your political nature to deny the crimes of any group technically on the left , whilst exaggerating the ones of groups from the right . 
  that 's why we end up with abominations like certain people screaming thatcher for example was a monster , whilst waring lenin or che shirts . 
  unless lightspeed is n't the fastest possible speed , which we are pretty sure it is , we wo n't travel anywhere . 
  distances are too great , in the hundreds of light years , for even a lightspeed ship to get there . 
  it 's just physically impossible for us to colonise space to any degree beyond our solar system . 
  not a question of technology . 
  where will they go ? 
  unless we can build space ships that can travel for centuries and replace their populations we are n't gon na reach far . 
  and that 's rather impossible . 
  do you mean small-case hand-writing these letters ? 
  because on print they are as your right column , only in handwriting do they look like the left one . 
  but i thought in handwriting the russians also did them like on the left ? 
  does n't your handriwting look like ours - http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/9254/img20111009113405copy.jpg, 
  how come `` attacked '' ? 
  were the refugees just chillin on the beach as the greeks `` attacked '' them ? 
  and greek is a modified phoenician alphabet . 
  still we call it greek though , being developped there . 
  we did n't get help with tanks , heavy artillery , heavy weaponry and bombs to reduce kiev to rubble as they ' v done in donbas . 
  we were n't trying to expand the largest state in the world by cutting another state 's territory . 
  they should be crushed because they are waging a war of aggression , trying to redraw the borders of europe for the sake of increasing russia 's influence back into eastern europe . 
  they are mercenaries , paid and organzied by the kremlin , just as it did in so many other places in the region in the past 25 years . 
  they should be crushed because they are violating the internationally recognised borders and sovereignty of an european country . 
  the maidan did none of these things , it did n't result in 6.800 people dead and counting . 
  you compare protesters to bloodthirsty murderers and mercenaries just because you love your precious russia and because it is n't happening in your country . 
  if greek thrace was overrun with turkish mercenaries from ankara waging a war against the `` athens junta '' for independence and maybe unity with turkey you 'd be singing a different song . 
  according to the last-years un demographic projection for the 21st century africa will quadruple , to 4 billion people by end of this century and 2 billion by 2050 . 
  asia will increase by 3 billion . 
  europe will remain the same . 
  today it has barely 9 % of the world 's population , it will have 6 % by 2050 and 4 % by 2100 . 
  you honestly ca n't see a way that open borders of europe will fill it with gradually increasing asian and african populations ? 
  considering africa will tripple its poor ? 
  considering it will be the most affected by climate change continent ? 
  resulting in huge desertifications and draughts that will drive tens of millions away ? 
  you ca n't see how taking in those tens of millions , with very high fertility rates , will contribute to a severe replacement of current native peoples and cultures ? 
  which in turn will cause massive social clashes and fundamental changes ? 
  and what happened when the bulgars and slavs came ? 
  they `` integrated '' among the thracians ? 
  or did they replace them ? 
  did they impose their own culture , language , identity ? 
  today the thracian language is gone . 
  the thracian culture is gone . 
  the thracian identity is gone . 
  it is fully replaced by salvo-bulgarians and but a footnote in history . 
  should i want ours to be the same fate ? 
  should i support that we be replaced the same way ? 
  our 1300 years of history be just a footnote same as the thracians before us ? 
  the mongols reached the periphery of europe and returned quickly after the deaths of ghenghis and later batu . 
  no massive migaration of peoples occured with them all over europe . 
  neither with the magyars - they replaced the people in only one region - pannonia , so the avars today are no more . 
  good example , like with the bulgars , of what happens to cultures and identities once they loose their majority on their lands - they dissapear into history . 
  the turks replaced the people of anatolia - after thousands of years of greek and armenian culture there it is 100 % turkic islamic today . 
  so a good example too , but one not in europe either . 
  on the european continent only one large-scale migration and has happened , that reached all of its corners same as it does today , and it was the great migration at the start of the early middle ages . 
  it did n't end well for many native peoples and cultures , as the one starting now wo n't if we do n't stop it . 
  it 's a myth the scale of immigration towards europe we see now is something ordinary and the status quo for `` thousands of years '' . 
  it is n't - it 's an extremely rare occurance that last time happened 1600 years ago and resulted in the almost complete replacement of the native people and cultures with new ones . 
  i 'm not making a statement one way or another - if you dislike the current european civilization and cultures and wish them replaced by those of africa and the middle east feel free to support the ongoing process . 
  just do n't make factual errors claiming we are n't experiencing something entirely out of the oridinary - a unique process of mass human movement that will have profound social , demographic and cultural changes . 
  ( good or bad , it is irrelevant to my point ), 
  they associate our language , culture , alphabet with russia , and our state with romania . 
  especially infuriating to have to explain it is n't the `` russian alphabet '' we use , it 's them using ours . 
  that 's a myth , there has n't been an emigration towards europe at this scale since the fall of the roman empire . 
  i have first hand knowledge on the maidan , being there and seeing how it was organised , rather than the pathetic pro-kremlin accusations people like you throw about foreign paid coup . 
  for the russian military i trust the rebel leaders themsleves : http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/11506774/separatist-fighter-admits-russian-tanks-troops-decisive-in-eastern-ukraine-battles.html or the plenty of evidence the ukrainian army has brought up , including captured russian soldiers , russian tanks and gear , russian bases : http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/30/apparent-russian-base-found-in-ukraine.html# or the selfies and internet boasting of russian troops themselves : http://www.vox.com/2015/6/17/8795235/russia-ukraine-troops or the fact chechens and other muslims from the caucasus are spotted fighting on the dnr-side all over eastern ukraine . 
  did they suddenly find in themselves some lost love for slavic and christian people to go and `` volunteer '' ?

  sofia has a number of very large lakes and artificial reservoars nearby , as well as the country 's longest river some 20 kilometres away . 
  furthermore , it lies on top of some of europe 's largest mineral water deposits , which is why it was a roman and ottoman `` spa centre '' with plenty of baths built by both . 
  when the metro was being built they had the trouble of running into a lot of very large underground rivers . 
  today the large brands of bottled water in bulgaria use those waters for their industry . 
  for all the above purposes tap water is quite clean and good to drink . 
  besides , being a mountainous city there 's a fair amount of rainfall and lots of snow in winter for the nearby crops . 
  thus , to answer your question , it 's quite the opposite - other parts of the country suffer droughts , but not sofia . 
  how come ? 
  our [ coat of arms ] ( http://wiki.hattrick.org/w/images/d/da/coat_of_arms_of_bulgaria.png ) is 3 lions , and originates in the middle ages , when [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e0/coat_of_arms_ivan_shishman.jpg ) was the coat of arms of the [ second bulgarian empire ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bulgarian_empire ) . 
  our flag is a homage to the italian flag , due to our freedom-fighters of the 19th century having close ties with garibaldi and drawing inspiration from his fighters . 
  it is meant to symbolise freedom and unity in the context that our country was liberated shortly after the italian unification . 
  all other explanations about `` the white is purity , the green is nature , the red is blah blah blah '' is much later , usually communist era , bullshit . 
  indeed it is horrible to get foreign investments and outsourcing . 
  better pray for oil instead . 
  because there is no automotive industrial base here . 
  our production specialises in other branches , like electronics , chemistry , metalurgy , textilles or food processing . 
  we have no car factories and therefore the entire workforce needed - specialists or people experienced in this . 
  they 'd need to build factories from scratch and train a workforce , whereas poland , czechia and slovakia all have huge automotive industries , thus the base and workers for it all ready .
