  wheras we go en mass to greece and turkey because everyone despises how expensive and shitty our seaside has become . 
  officially last year about 2x bulgarians chose greece and turkey for their summer holiday than bulgaria . 
  made an account just to write this ? 
  it infuriates me more people here are pissed off at the fact we got bombed twice by the allies than the fact we got occupied by the soviets . 
  communist propaganda is quite strong in people 's minds still . 
  was n't it chausescu who destroyed mosto f bucharest 's old city and replaced with monstrosities ? 
  those stats honestly surprised me . 
  everyone 's moaning here how our agriculture has been `` totally decimated by 25 years of democracy '' , yet we seem to export almost as much as greece and only about 0.5 times less than romania - that is twice our size and 3 times the population . 
  the comparisson is even more shocking with bulgaria - our gdp , economy and living standards are n't much higher than serbia 's , yet we exported $ 27.9 billion in 2014 and greece exported $ 27.2 billion in 2014 . 
  it truly baffles me how come eu 's poorest country can export more than one with 4 times the economy and 1.5 times the population . 
  probably regreted not staying in romania instead . 
  get regular annual check-up with a doctor . 
  the kid did n't have prevention or detection , that 's the problem . 
  it 's treatable otherwise . 
  that 's fourth comment and counting of how much `` you do n't give a fuck '' . 
  every time you come back to have the last word like a little boy your original comment gets funnier . 
  because i live in this country , and the head of our state just experienced a life-changing trauma that might lead to the first president we have resigning , altering the fragile balance of power here and resulting in a number of changes . 
  i shared it in r/europe where such political stuff is being discussed . 
  it makes perfect sense to me , unlike all the comments of people asking why they should care . 
  why the fuck ask if you do n't care ? 
  do i go to random threads on r/science about some random science fact and ask `` why do i care '' ? 
  if one does n't care about something he ignores it and lets the people who do discuss it . 
  i have my resons to discuss it , so i 'm here - you do n't , but you ' r also here . 
  that 's what needs explanation , not my reasons to post . 
  i respond to someone cursing in my thread - makes perfect sense . 
  you writing a number of comments already , despite `` not giving a fuck '' , is the only attention seeking around here . 
  not too popular at school are we ? 
  trying to compensate on the web ? 
  well i get you boy , i hope things go better for you and one day you have enough friends you wo n't need to go to random places on the web to say `` how much you do n't care '' about what you just spent time commenting on more than once . 
  i ' v shared it cause i care about it , being from this country . 
  no reason for anyone else to care , as you ' v written yourself , which makes it rather paradoxical you would write such a long comment or one at all just to say why you don ; t care . 
  `` not caring '' about something means ignoring it , so what are you doing here ? 
  nope . 
  no reason at all . 
  so why are you here then , commenting ? 
  thanks . 
  when did such a thing happen to a german or british prime minister/chancellor for you to have that information ? 
  or is it cause they ` r , you know , better by presumption ... 
  i 'm not the one commenting like a teeanger begging for attention `` omg who cares , obviously not me , despite putting effort to tell you guys , i just do n't care , that 's how cuuul i am , you care but i do n't , see , see '' . 
  what a loser . 
  it seems you , if you ' v decided to take the time to open the comments and even write one yourself . 
  it seems you , if you ' v decided to take the time to open the comments and even write one yourself . 
  it 's not because he was famous , but because he was one of eu 's 28 heads of state . 
  this is a forum about europe , is n't it ? 
  about politics quite often ? 
  we get posts about what this head of state said , or where he vacationed , but we ca n't get one about experiencing something as pivotal as that ? 
  something that might trigger our first presidential resignation ? 
  new elections amid a politically unstable situation ? 
  a new president that does n't take as strong a stance on russia or the eu as this one ? 
  this is n't just some singer 's son dying , it 's a person with real power whose decisions make real difference . 
  and those decisions will most certainly be affected by something as strong as this . 
  so by all means it is relevant to all who are interested in eu , europe and the politics of its countries , as this forum is . 
  in your country it is considered `` propaganda '' to say someone 's son has died ? 
  fair enough , you have your opinion on what 's worthy of sharing and caring for and what is n't . 
  but that still does n't explain the proapganda accusation - what the hell am i propagating ? 
  what political or religious ideology am i pushing ? 
  what message do i try to impose on people or convince them ? 
  that someone 's son has died ? 
  i do n't think you use the term propaganda correctly . 
  your description of why this post is wrong makes it seem you think of it as pointless and unimportant , not a propaganda , but then you go on and call it that . 
  do please check the term and do n't use it like that in the future , cause it makes no sense . 
  it should n't . 
  it concerns me and so i share it . 
  whoever else wishes to express condolences is free to do so . 
  if 600 + syrians dead concerned you as much as you try to show you 'd post about it , same as i just did about something that concerns me . 
  you are trying to be an ass by complaining on other people giving condolences for one thing , when you think there 's other stuff to give for . 
  do something about it instead of trying to be `` hip '' and `` edgy '' in a thread about someone 's past away son . 
  that 's just in poor taste . 
  first of , i 'm not asking anyone , i hoped whoever wants to do it will do it , whoever wishes not to wo n't . 
  secondly , this subforum is filled with stuff that is in no way connected to `` politics or europe 's interest '' , stuff like `` look at this swedish cartoon from the 70s '' or a man was killed in london . 
  compared to that the death of the child of a head of state , which might trigger a resignation or total change in his politics up until now , is indeed far more political or relevant . 
  i checked your profile and did n't see you complaining in much more irrelevant topics like these below : https://bg.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g8m5i/nrks_slow_tv_keen_to_follow_reindeer/ https://bg.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g72j8/a_swedish_man_has_filed_a_complaint_because_a/ https://bg.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g8nvp/man_slashed_from_ear_to_ear_in_east_london/ https://bg.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3g92ft/monster_truck_accident_in_finland_6_people_badly/, 
  explain ? 
  what is this propagating ? 
  for the first paragraph - we do n't mourn them because we do n't know/hear about them . 
  when we do hear a normal guy 's child died , say your neighbour 's or co-workers of course you mourn and feel sad , even more so . 
  it happens more often with famous people due to exposure , not some perceived double standard you so `` edgily '' try to show us . 
  about the second - this is the child of the head of state of one of the 28 eu states . 
  it will surely cause a great trauma for him and make considerable difference in his actions , policies and positions from now on . 
  it will actually have a very real effect on europe or some part of it , in the form of either a president resigning if he ca n't handle it , or withdrawing from active policies or something else . 
  you might be some hippie who hates the notions that some people , famous and powerful , have tragedies and events in their life more important than the regular folk , but that 's because those events actually can influence society and lead to other events , especially if the affected person is a head of state . 
  finally , this subreddit gets topics about stuff like a danish cartoon show or a song from albania , but you think a pivotal event in the life of a head of state is too unimportant ? 
  trying to be edgy much ? 
  second time to choose the germans for our national unification , second time to pay for it . 
  jesus christ that 's horrible . 
  i presumed , or hoped , it was not unexpected and the result of a known illness or condition , but this makes it an absolute tragedy . 
  next to my name dingus . 
  tell both of that to the ukrainians - to the 40 million who consider themselves ethnic ukrainians , hate russia and speak their own language . 
  also to the ones fighting regular russian troops in `` dpr '' uniforms . 
  no ethnic ukrainians are pro-russian , they all hate it more than anything . 
  and they used to be abut 70 % in ukraine with crimea and donbas . 
  without them the ethnic ukrainians are now more than 85 % and that 's the minimum of people that hate russia , even if we ignore the fact plenty of the ethnic russians in ukraine from the remaining 15 % also hate russia , because they are loyal to their country ukraine which is under russian invasion . 
  there 's zero doubt in ukraine 's opposition to russia at the moment . 
  and the recent extensive research into the attitudes towards russia and the us around the world proves it : http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/05/08/despite-concerns-about-governance-ukrainians-want-to-remain-one-country/, 
  i hope you are right . 
  the government 's actions still seem to me as detached from the majority population , who would love for the country to act as consistently as russia 's balkan satellite as it did before . 
  at least based on the serbs i ' v interacted with . 
  countries should n't do the bidding of other countries and invade their neighbours , no . 
  also , my opinion comes from extensive interaction with serbs , due to attending numerous model un and model eu conferences , plenty of which in belgrade , and talking to serbs of various social backgrounds and ages about politics and international relations . 
  i can say an overwhelming percentage subscribed to the major points propagated by the ussr and now the new kremlin propaganda machine - the `` east vs. west '' divide , with `` holy russia '' a bastion of decency , orthodoxy and conservatism against the decadent , greedy west .
