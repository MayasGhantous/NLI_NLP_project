  ok , i 'll be totally honest in sharing an opinion i 'm too sure is n't horrible . 
  i kinda ... want putin to start a war with an eu or nato country . 
  i kinda want him to invade openly , proper , just so we can shatter once and for all the idiotic excuses and lies about moscow 's involvment in the war in ukraine and intentions . 
  then i 'd like to see their army crushed by a united eu or nato effort , which will not only disspell the myth of russia 's invincibility and `` world power status '' , but also serve as a much needed unification boost to the rather shaky eu and nato relations . 
  it might be super cynical , but the reality is nothing unites people like a common goal/war/enemy , and a defensive war against such could be the push we need for a common eu army and more integration . 
  a united europe would n't need one country to be `` the heart '' . 
  that sounds like an uneven union . 
  a united europe 's `` heart '' would be the best of each nation . 
  but not the union 's capital , which is either the political in brussels or the financial in frankfurt . 
  btw , why is a finnish describing berlin as his capital ? 
  if you go by `` financial '' capital as opposed to the political one in brussels it 's rather frankfurt . 
  wherever it is there should definitely be a lot of harmless physical competitions and games organized for the balkan people to channel their annimosity and competitiveness towards eachother or else it will pile up and turn ugly . 
  podemos is certainly a text-book far left . 
  a representative of their was saying women who are grossed out to eat their periods are not true feminists . 
  another one was describing the eu and the us as `` the worst things to have happened in all of human history '' . 
  that truly surprised me . 
  was n't spain experiencing a far-left wave ? 
  are n't those usually sort of anti-globalist , anti-western and by association - pro-anyone-who-is-against-those ? 
  like putin ? 
  i 'd love seeing the rebels crushed , ukrainian army completely in control of the region and then ... organizing a referendum for independence or joining russia . 
  a brazen reinsertion of how things should be done - peacefully , and hopefully a ukraine unburdoned by that war-torn region . 
  let the russians rebuild what they ' v destroyed and carry the burden of the region for decades , whilst ukraine unifies more and heads for integration with the west . 
  reality . 
  the confusing part is serbs use both alphabets . 
  in bulgarian however it 's just like serbian - all written exactly as it is pronounced , one letter for one sound only , no `` silent '' useless letters , but also only one alphabet , so it 's streamlined to perfection . 
  you do n't need to learn any exeptions to read every word you encounter correctly - just the alhpabet , but also need to learn only one alphabet . 
  not sure why certain war heroes should n't be glorified . 
  when they defend their state from aggressors , especially ones as genocidal as the nazis , there 's little room left for the usual cynicism that 's so popular nowadays . 
  they kinda * were * heroes . 
  your second sentance makes no sense , elaborate . 
  as far as i know the `` death camps '' were around krakow to the south and around the eastern polish cities . 
  unless germans now consider all of poland , not just silesia and pomerania , as `` stolen '' ... 
  besides , even if the camps were on land that was later given to poland , are you actually claiming the polish should take the responsibility for those entirely german death camps because they now control the land the camps were on ? 
  what kind of fucked up logic is that ? 
  the one who set the camps up , operated them and killed millions , including poles , is to be blamed 100 % , ergo the germans . 
  not the one on whose land those camps were built . 
  turkey has been proven again and again to support isis , so i 'd rather ask where the eu and nato are when one of their member and candidate-member is supporting a genocidal rogue state . 
  you know what 's even more worthy of respect ? 
  not attacking your neighbours . 
  why are germans always so annoyed at formats spreading the awareness it was n't `` polish death camps '' , but german ones ? 
  ( no , not `` nazi '' , german camps ), 
  kudos for the us secret service if it was true . 
  did n't see the of when i read your comment. , thought you called them `` made up countries '' as so many have done before . 
  my mistake . 
  and i do n't blame you . 
  i just ca n't see it as this monster party city `` rio of the balkans '' when there 's roughly as many clubs per capita as other capitals , but far fewer choice in types . 
  zagreb was pretty cool in that regard . 
  you are trying to make sense of it or show that we use the same word as so many other countries have . 
  that 's not the question here - `` hey guys , how would you call it in your language '' , it 's a question how we do call it and in bulgaria the words shum and statichen shum ( noise , static noise ) are used , regardless if you like , if it makes sense or if you 'd like it we used the same word `` snow '' as other countries do . 
  we do n't , accept it . 
  census would take care of that , as would tax , employment and consumption statistics . 
  poland certainly has n't lost 5 million people already , or it would harshy feel it . 
  ( like we do ), 
  who the hell uses that ? 
  never heard it once in my life . 
  we use `` shum '' or `` statichen shum '' - static noise in my city . 
  first time i see polish regurgitating russian national propaganda . 
  should n't you be impervious to this ? 
  i ' v heard the term used far too often for the baltics , slovakia , ukraine or romania in regards to them not existing with such names and borders for long , so naturally made me think of this first . 
  `` made up countries '' ( i guess you refering to the baltics or belarus ) as opposed to what - `` nature-made countries '' ? 
  `` god-made countries '' ? 
  bismarck-made countries ? 
  cuba of the balkans . 
  krakow old town is like a medieval fairytale . 
  for a historian like myself it 's one of the best places in europe to be . 
  unfortunately 90 % of the parties are turbo folk . 
  could n't escapte that when i was there . 
  i much prefer the more diverce choice of the party scene in bucharest , athens or sofia . 
  it pisses me off to se something like that happening in the only axis country that managed to save its jews during ww2 entirely through the social pressure of the people and the church . 
  we have two objectives - get the continent energy independent through renewables and nuclear ; and get deeper integration that will make europe capable of collectively defending its position , interrests and borders in this rapidly changing world . 
  it will actually have 5 million people less . 
  courtesey of whom ... ? 
  vitoshka and the nearby streets do n't look worse than the shopping street i saw in prague right in front of the national museum and the monument . 
  neither does the area around the national theatre or the palace , or the russian church and military club , or the alexander nevsky cathedral - all places on par in their outlook with other european capitals . 
  calling them a dump is either hate or arrogance filled , and if you ' r a czech i 'd say it ; s probably the second , since as a pole i ' v dealt with plenty of you guys and you demonstrate the same attitude to poland and the rest of the countries surrounding you ( one even called my city , krakow , shitty when i was at uni , and the guy was from fucking olomouc ) . 
  something about calling other places shittier than bohemia , but i ca n't right put it down to arrogance or lack of confidence ... 
  i work and live in the closed surburb that surrounds my office building next to the mountain . 
  there 's a whole bunch of other suburbes along the mountain range all the way to dragalevtzi . 
  they are all brand new , gated and look pretty much like my neighbourhood in leuven , belgium , when i studied there . 
  pristine , new and much nicer than anything i believe is in skopje . 
  ergo , you are either lying or have no idea about the city . 
  it 's a shame you live in some run-down part of town , i am sorry things did n't work out for you in life , but being filled with anger and regret towards the city is n't going to make it better . 
  find a better job , move to a nice neighbourhood or a new suburb round the mountain of which there are plenty , and you wo n't be as bitter and hateful as you are now . 
  i know , but at least an albanian from vardarska and someone who actually lived in the region . 
  unlike greek alexander who was born and lived outside of modern fyrom and has a huge monument in a city he never set foot in . 
  or a bunch of bulgarian rulers and people that would laugh at the idea of being claimed by a `` macedonian nation '' . 
  you only realise how unimportant your country is when you find yourself hoping to see it mentioned in a thread about the worst cities in europe . 
  `` might makes right '' - the fundamental principle of the russian mentality . 
  or - `` the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must '' . 
  you truly are stuck in the middle ages . 
  `` and why are you beating the blacks ? '', 
  so maybe you should ' v remained under the mongols , since you had a `` separatist revolt '' against the integrity of the golden horde . 
  pffft , are russians seriously still as daft as to call people fighting against foreign occupation `` separatist revolts '' . 
  sofia 's outer neighbourhoods look as any other communist blocks concrete jungles . 
  i ' v seen such in bucharest , warsaw and even prague . 
  i bet skopie has them as well . 
  the [ centre ] ( http://bow.bg/uploads/attachment/filename/sofia_bulgaria.jpg ) on the other hand of sofia is quite [ nice ] ( http://blog.radissonblu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/21809579_l.jpg ) , it lacks kitch bronze statues or fake marble monstrosities . 
  it has a lot of pre-communist [ buildings ] ( http://whata.org/images/1858.jpg ) that give off a distinct `` austrohungarian '' [ vibe ] ( http://novinar.bg/data/2006-03-11/11230112.jpg ) , as they were built in that style . 
  it also has some of the highest concetration of large [ parks ] ( http://212.73.128.12/pictures/athletic/pic_big/gallery/stadioni/ariana.jpg ) of any european capital , which are well maintained . 
  many of the [ outer neighbourhoods ] ( http://www.olympicwanderings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sofia-view.jpg ) are also starting to get modernized .
