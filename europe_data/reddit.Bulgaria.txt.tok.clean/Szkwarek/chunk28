  shortly after the crowning of the [ first ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsar ) ruler to actually use the title tsar - [ simeon i ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simeon_i_of_bulgaria ) . 
  that 's aprox . 
  6 centuries before the [ russians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_the_terrible ) began using the same title and naturally , the name of that city . 
  it 's thus a bulgarian name first and foremost , then perhaps serbian since they were the second to use the bulgarian title for emperor , and much less russian . 
  it 's hard to understand why should it be against the law of turkey , as cited for a reason , to build orthodox churches in istanbul or turkey , if the turks themselves are eager to build mosques abroad . 
  the lack of people is your argument , not the one given by the turkish authorities at the romanian request for a church . 
  `` what is so fucking hard to understand here ? '', 
  i 'd love to meet some . 
  all i ever communicated with have the `` anti-globalist '' , `` anti-capitalist '' mentality that views the west and the us in particular as the arch-devil and by association all who oppose it as good . 
  thus russia , china , iran and all `` brics '' countries are good - us , israel and the eu - bad . 
  yes , he said it was turkish government funded and , in the post above , not intented for the turkish minority because they live mainly on the black sea . 
  the two are n't mutually exclusive , since plenty of islamist governments build mosques in other countries without having their own citizens there ( eg . 
  saudi arabia , qatar ) . 
  the current islamist turkish government is building a mosque in bucharest for the sake of islam , not its own citizens . 
  perhaps you should be the one who learns how to read . 
  i also am surprised purely due to the fact all italians i ' v ever met in my study in belgium and the uk were leftist and naturally , pro-russia . 
  i was left with the impression there is a strong socialist sphere in italy that thinks like that . 
  i appreciate you trying to make you people look better , but the insistance on alexander being entirely not greek , but with an identity correlating to the modern macedonian one is something so firmly repeated by skopje and its `` academics '' i can probably spam a page or two with links to it . 
  skopje most certainly portrays him as a figure of a historical macedonian nation , directly descendant of whom is today 's macedonians , and definitely not greek . 
  it 's quite refreshing to see a macedonian who does n't think that , but still , do n't pretend it 's the prevelant or official position of your country . 
  samuil never really was up for debate before macedonians claimed him , since he was born in bulgaria , crowned as tsar of all bulgarians , wrote letters with the stamp of bulgaria on them and ruled a state that had continuously existed for 3 centuries prior as `` bulgaria '' in all byzantine , later church , and even at some cases vatican archives . 
  again , it shows the modern macedonian mentality - someone has a fortress in macedonia , he is macedonian . 
  not even birth we talk about here , a frotress . 
  seriously ? 
  the thing about your geographic identity is that it was n't separate all history - someone could be born in the lands of modern macedonia , be slavic and christian and still consider himself part of another nation . 
  like delchev , who considered himself a macedonian regionally , and bulgarian nationally . 
  that 's like being a wessex english , or a malopolska polish . 
  you , on the other hand , take any regional identity of all people who ever lived in today 's borders as national . 
  no one can be historically macedonian albanian , macedonian bulgaria , macedonian greek etc. 
  - they are all macedonian and nothing else , according to skopje logic . 
  bulgaria was created 1300 years ago and survived for centuries , with its history documented better by byzantine , church , bulgarian , hungarian , vatican and latin sources than most countries in history . 
  it ceased to exist between the 15th and 19th centuries due ot ottoman occupatio and was restored in 1878 . 
  a country of slavic people called `` macedonia '' never existed before 1991 , so your comparison is not entirelly correct . 
  the presalv literary school , where early cyrillic script was invented , is far away from ohrid . 
  as for the nationality , although i tried avoiding this powderkeg , i will say this - it 's not how you call yourself or what identity you want to have that annoys people , it 's the projection of your current , quite recently formed national identity onto historical figures and peoples from the past . 
  no one cares if you want to be a nation of slavic people with the name macedonians today , completely separate from bulgarians , serbs or greeks . 
  it 's your insitance that alexander the great had that exact same identity that is idiotic . 
  or tsar samuil . 
  or goce delchev . 
  or a ton others , who lived long before 1945 and the formation of the modern macedonian identity and language . 
  you just do n't seem to comprehend that when alexander is called a `` macedonian '' this does n't refer to the same identity of slavic balkan orthodox christians with a dialect close to bulgarian , as it refers to today . 
  many different nations and people lived in the historic region of macedonia and called themselves macedonian , but it does n't mean they all belong to the same line of nationality/ethnicity , as modern macedonism tries to teach and impose with their kitch statues . 
  that would be equivalent to bulgarians calling belisarius or constantine the great , born within the borders of modern bulgaria - `` bulgarians '' . 
  we clearly make a separation between our land and the different identities on it , whereas macedonians just put a stamp on all that were ever born or lived in the historical region of macedonia as part of their , modern and quite recently formed , nation . 
  prostitutes . 
  figures . 
  classy as always . 
  these two are creddited , together with 5 others as `` the 7 saint brothers '' ( \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u0421\u0435\u0434\u043c\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 ) who supposedly invented it . 
  it 's considered today rather part of church doctrinal tradition , then a historical fact . 
  records point out to it being rather the product of successive scholars working more than a decade in the preslav literary school on matching the double-phonic glagollitic to single-sound letters for old church slavonic in bulgaria . 
  which is why today the cyrillic has a single letter for each sound , rather than the way most latin and glagollitic were . 
  i will complete avoid the slipper slope towards nationalistic banter on whether such a thing as a `` macedonian '' nationality existed at the time , and only comment on the fact that cyril and methodius did not , in fact , invent the cyrillic alphabet . 
  they invented the [ glagolitic alphabet ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_alphabet ) . 
  it was their students at the [ preslav literary school ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/preslav_literary_school ) founded in the capital of the bulgarian empire by boris i that invented the [ cyrillic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_cyrillic_alphabet ) to better fit the old church slavonic of the bulgarians and named it after their teacher - cyril . 
  what we use today is based on that alphabet and can actually read ( albeit with difficulty ) the letters from 1000 years ago . 
  the glagollitic alphabet of cyril and methodius is unreadable by any modern cyrillic user , so it 's rather a common misconception today to credit those two with something named after them , but not by them . 
  this is what cyril and methodius invented ( glagollitic ) : http://www.matthumbard.com/images/glag.jpg this is what was invented in the preslav literary school in bulgaria and named after cyril ( early cyrillic script ) : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/%d0%90%d0%b7%d0%b1%d1%83%d0%ba%d0%b0.jpg, 
  to us she 's like that kidnapped sister you had which spent too long being brainwashed by her captors and now does n't even recognise you . 
  instead she dresses herself like a [ clown ] ( http://i54.tinypic.com/dfdcug.jpg ) and says she 's [ alexander the great ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=skopje+2014&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=995&amp;bih=927&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchmip66wrsjlxgivhbcsch3owqmx ) . 
  and we 'll fight both of you over it just like the old times . 
  someone pls keep the romanians and turks from stabbing us in the back and we might pull it off the 3rd time . 
  bulgarian is already used in the eu , so that country 's covered . 
  why would the political cost be high if the entirety of greece knows how much the economy suffers from tax evasion ? 
  would n't people actually vote en mass for whatever party embarks on hard-line restructuring of the tax offices and crack-down on tax evasion ? 
  makes sense . 
  what would you say led to that system ? 
  pasok placating the public for decades and staying in power by not taking definitive measures against tax evasion and in favour of a competative economy ? 
  fair enough , i think they are all related in a culture of anti-capitalist mentality that has been festering since the 70s and spreading the idea that `` taxes are theft '' , but as you wish . 
  carefully ommiting the other points . 
  most certainly the majority of greeks have either : voted for pasok or protested ( supported the protests ) against cuts in pensions/sallaries/wellfare / subsidies or tax increase or avoided to take a vat receipt in order to get a cheaper deal or happily take 13th/14th or even 15th pension/public sallary the accumulation of the above thigns alone is enough to cause greece 's massive fiscal problems even without all else i mentioned that could only apply to landlords , self-employed ( that 's a third of worders actually ) , rich , corporations etc. 
  i certainly do n't blame the whole nation . 
  i 'm very selective in fact - i only blame those greeks who ever in their life voted for pasok , did n't ask for a receipt or chose to pay less for a service/good by avoiding tax , those who protested or supported a protest against wellfare cuts , pension cuts , tax raises or end to subsidies . 
  i blame those who demanded or supported the demands for a heavily subsidized agricultural secotor , shipping sector or public sector . 
  i blame those 33 % self-employed greek who did n't register any particular service or profit they made . 
  those landlords who did n't register tennants whilst having such . 
  those people who eargerly received the pensions of their deceased parents even after they had passed . 
  those pensioneers or public workers who happily accepted 14th sallary or pension despite a country that obviously ca n't afford it . 
  i only blame the above described types greeks , not the nation ad hoc , it 's not my fault that the majority subscribes to at least some of the describtions . 
  but that 's not the reality as much as your biased view . 
  it was n't the rich that kept voting pasok in . 
  it was n't the rich that kept voting out any politicians willing to cut welfare and increase taxes . 
  it was n't the rich that went on massive strikes and protests any time someone wanted to lower pensions or increase retirement age . 
  it was n't the rich that kept me at the greek-bulgarian border about 10 years ago for hours on end because the farmers were protesting a cut to subsidies . 
  it was n't just the rich that got 35 years of living standards far beyond what the country 's economy can sustain . 
  it was all of you - the majority of the greeks . 
  you were happy to follow pasok into the socialist utopia after the cournels ' junta . 
  happy to get ever larger pensions , sallaries and public spending at the expense of uncopetitiveness and debt . 
  it was all of you who prevented any government with fiscally conservative policies to come to power and put a stop to your country 's economical degradation and descent into debt . 
  and yes , it was most certainly most of you that avoided paying for vat by asking for receipts . 
  typical leftist mentality - only the rich are always to be blamed , and crying out `` racism '' only way out when someone criticises your people . 
  i bet even you ' v personally not taken a vat receipt or chosen the cheaper way for a service or good , but think it does n't really make a difference . 
  `` it 's those rich guys that are to blame '' . 
  the anti-capitalist mentality and socialist spending of the past 35 years is what got you into the trouble , not some evil clique of rich guys behind the curtains . 
  i apologize for that gross generalization . 
  `` something enough greeks do to rank the country top of the world in tax evasion '' . 
  is that more correct ? 
  greek government proposes lottery to incourage greeks to ask for vat receipts . 
  http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/03/greece-lottery-idusl6n0tn31u20141203 greece 's tourism chief urges tourists to use credit cards to prevent greek vendors from hiding vat . 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/02/greece-tourists-credit-cards-tax-evasion definitely looks like `` only the corporations and the rich lawyers/doctors hide vat '' ... 
  it still is .
