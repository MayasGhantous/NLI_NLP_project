  how does that explain the absolute correlation of poorer states around the world having high crime rates ? 
  central america also exports a ton of its criminals , far more than poland , to the us , and yet it has high crime rates . 
  bulgarian organized crime also specializes in credit-card fraud . 
  it dominates this sector in europe actually . 
  it is by far not a fact that bulgaria is a relatively safe countries , or one without migrants . 
  we are absolutely crime riddled when it comes to non-violent crime . 
  there 's an epidemic of car theft in the larger cities and our police has a rate of crime solving of ** 4 % ** . 
  pickpocketing is huge , and so is home burglaries . 
  domestic crime is entirely not reported or tackled in any way , shape or form , and victims of such have no place to turn , unlike in western europe . 
  our murder rate is low , sure , but our assault and battery rate is very high , especially on the road . 
  and i think you are completely ommiting institutional and corruption related crime for some reason , as if it was n't `` crime '' . 
  we are champions of it , it 's rotten the entire state and businesses are routinely stolen , in their entirety , by paid judges who write the business off to new owners . 
  that 's theft , and we ' r plagued by it . 
  as for the `` migrants '' - lets be honest , you mean minorities in the west . 
  all of them , combined - those who recently came and those who are born there as arab/muslim minorities reach around 8 % -10 % of the population of countries like france or germany . 
  meanwhile , we have 10 % gypsies , who are far less integrated , working , paying taxes and much more prone to crime than their `` migrants '' . 
  so , no - we are n't in any better situation . 
  we have a shit ton of crime and a shit ton of ethnic ghettos , far bigger and far worse than their `` arab '' or `` african '' ghettos . 
  what we do n't have is their wealth and development to tackle this . 
  hence - massive emigration . 
  germany is 3 times richer , more developped , less corrupt , with better paid and organised institutions and police , twice less unemployment , hugely larger wellfare and social programs , etc. 
  etc. . . and * still * it is `` nearly '' as less crime as poland . 
  that does n't look like an anomaly to you ? 
  i know he 's being obnoxious with this comment , but when you think about it , why is eastern europe lower ranked here than western despite all other maps with criteria - social and economica , showing the opposite ? 
  should n't the poorer east have higher crime ? 
  what other explanation than the highly crime-intensive migrant enclaves make the west relatively higher ? 
  you do n't pay monthly in taxes as much as you will be getting in pensions . 
  not even 20 % as much . 
  this is n't how it works - the economy sustains the budget that pays your pension and the economy ca n't run properly if there are more elderly people than those in working age . 
  it 's your duty to make at least 2 children in your life with one other person to at least cover the two pensioners there will be eventually . 
  otherwise you ' r a strain on other people 's children . 
  europe 's and ther rest of the developed world 's greatest problem is the opposite - ageing , not overpopulation . 
  overpopulation is only a problem in the third world , mainyl africa and asia . 
  unless we are to replace our population with theirs , we should start making more kids . 
  according to society and economics , sure . 
  according to biology it 's the opposite - 40 year old mom carries enormous risks during pregnancy and delivery as opposed to an 18 year old . 
  you run from undefendable statements you make like a rat . 
  it 's pathetic and hiding behind swearing and sulking does n't work . 
  they did - half of them pretty much , that 's how bosnians came to be . 
  do n't wonder why africa-ridiculing memes and stereotypes do n't die . 
  400 years under turk occupation , numerous times fought for them as vassals against other christians , saved the ottoman empire at the battle of ankara by protecting the heir and entire treasury , helped the turks besiege vienna ... `` kebab remover '' . 
  lol, 
  your aggressive attitue a-la pissed off little kid feeling inadequate says otherwise . 
  what a waste of time . 
  i love bacon and meat , i by no means think we should somehow fight this , but to be honest , factory farming is shitty and cruel . 
  small-scale farms are much better at treating the animals ( seen it on my grandparents ' one ) and provide the profit directly to the people who work it every day , not to the corporate owners of huge conglomerates that just hire minimum-wage workers . 
  it 's better for the animals , it 's better for the workers . 
  but it would definitely reduce efficiency and thus quantity , increasing price . 
  which i see no problem with - we eat too much meat as it is in the developped world . 
  no reason why a steak should cost as little as a few tomatoes . 
  even though i love , i 'd glady see meat price double or triple if this means we treat animals far better than factory farms do , and give more to the workers . 
  i bet it would help reduce obesity in the developped world too . 
  this shit is n't worth me getting cheap meat : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdisr0lgry8, 
  first of all , i do n't get what this at all has to do with you misinterpreting the proposal of people here . 
  someone says `` lets have a unified , equal country between ukr . 
  etc. '', 
  - you say `` no thanks i do n't want to be occupied '' . 
  that 's nothing to do with being european , turkish , russian etc. 
  - it 's just you for some reason twisting the proposal of unified , equal state to occupation . 
  i was just asking you why you do that . 
  secondly , `` being european '' is n't about want or not . 
  you * are * european . 
  because you are in europe . 
  you ca n't be something else . 
  russian , moldovan , hungarian , and belarussian are also europeans . 
  finally , i have no idea why you say some want to go to other countries , what does immigration have to do with the proposal of people in this thread of a unified commonwealth-type country with equal ukraine ? 
  you seem to talk of very unrelated things . 
  i am not sure you understand what was being discussed here . 
  not sure why you mention that , i asked you why do you refuse `` another polish-lithuanian occupation '' , when this was n't the proposal of anyone here , but that of an equal state for the nations . 
  people talk of an equal ukr-pl-other nations state , whereas you refuse `` occupation '' - not talked of by anyone . 
  `` want cake ? '', 
  `` no , but no thanks , not a huge fan of bacon . '', 
  you ca n't `` google '' questions on the basis of validity . 
  as in what * should * happen . 
  it 's up to you to decide how you think it should be . 
  should the european union help european nations , or african and asian ones . 
  was n't his proposal of an equal commonwealth , along the lines of that treaty from 1658 ? 
  it 's meant to be `` the jews '' . 
  by european i do n't mean purely geographic , i mean a civilization that is composed of nations marked in the fundamental ways each of them was established and developped by the same major concepts . 
  greco-roman influence and the re-acceptance and re-development of it through the renaissance . 
  christian religion and the cultural developments connected with more than 1000 years of its complete dominance on the history of every single one of those nations . 
  the englightment era of rationalising the world through the scientific method , and the embrace of the core ideas of the 18th and 19th century - nationalism , the french revolutionary liberalism and modern parliamentary democracy . 
  there exists in the world a selected group of nations , a very specific list , that has had all of its members influenced by the above . 
  nations that can all look back towards 1000 or more years of christianity , towards similar developments in literature styles , music styles , fashion , painting and art as a whole . 
  in serbia compoers compose similar classical pieces in the 18th century to those in far away ireland and spain . 
  in bulgaria the writers were influenced by shakespeare or geothe , as opposed to ab\u016b \u02bfal\u012b al-\u1e24usayn . 
  as far away as finland you can see [ buildings ] ( http://valtioneuvosto.fi/documents/10184/158647/valtioneuvoston+linna+2/199f637e-fae5-4235-99b9-461ddb7aea08?t=1408017047380 ) that represent the re-discovery of ancient greco-roman classicism back in 14th century italy . 
  that is not how [ rabat ] ( http://www.fsr.ac.ma/cmss/images/rabat/rabat2.jpg ) looks like , despite being far closer geographically . 
  so yes , there is definitely a strong civilizational line separating spain and morocco , despite being much closer . 
  a line that puts most european nations into the same historical civilization , sharing more traits with each-other than with any other nations around the world . 
  hence , i find it entirely logical for closer co-operation and help between these nations . 
  as i explained already - charity begins at home . 
  help your family first , then your neighbourhood , then city , country , region etc. 
  the european civilization is our closest family - when no more nations live in abject poverty like moldova or ukraine , * then * we should go on to help others . 
  in what way ? 
  it is when deciding where the budget of the ** european ** union should go towards . 
  to ** european ** countries that need it desperately or to african , asian etc. 
  i think this should be a rhetorical question . 
  same with moldova or ukraine . 
  is it more important to keep azerbayjan stable ( by the way , they have tons of oil ) than ukraine ?
