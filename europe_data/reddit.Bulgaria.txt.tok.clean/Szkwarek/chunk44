  is their stability and well-being more important than that of fellow europeans ? 
  ireland and uk have opt outs in place . 
  ireland 's visitors were overwhelmingly there on business trips , not leisure . 
  puting visas is enough to convince toursits to find other spots , but not enough to make multi-billion dollar corporations that go to ireland to save billions move their business because of some mild inconvenience to their staff . 
  wheras the structural funds it can allocate to alleviate the damage done to poorer states by the common market are limited . 
  if a huge country like ukraine joins the already many states in need of such will have theirs cut to the point they will lose financially inside the eu than win . 
  and by helping morrocans you say they are more worth than somalians ? 
  and by helping somalians you say they are more woth than vietnamese ? 
  let 's not play pathetic games , it 's simple math - the ** european ** union has limited resources , where do they go - to ** europe ** or to africa ? 
  europe is not a nation . 
  it 's entirely logical and rational to start `` charity at home '' - help people closer to you in all ways first , then those further away , then those further more . 
  stop looking for signs of `` the dreaded nationalism '' . 
  how is it giving money to europeans worse than to non europeans ? 
  ahhh for fucks sake even in imagined scenarios ... 
  that 's how migration to europe should happen . 
  first learned the language , then left islam , now wants to stay in one of the poorer states of the eu , rather than germany or sweden . 
  be sure he wo n't face any of the `` discrimination and stigma '' other arrivals do . 
  i wonder why ... 
  then they should n't have named it the european union . 
  now that it is , it should be focused on europe more than africa or asia , and there is not objective reasoning against that . 
  they are free to leave and make a different , say `` the mediterranean union '' or `` the ex-colonies union '' , like the british commonwealth . 
  but as long as we are talking where the eu - the ** european union ** should focus its efforts , we have all the right to claim it should be on the place bearing the first word of the union 's name - europe . 
  `` kill and destroy '' ? 
  show me a country who 's tourism relies more than 10 % on us citizens . 
  already answered this to another guy :  that is true , but only as long as structural funds are concerned . 
  the eu 's neghbourhood policy also allocates lots of funds fighting poverty , illiteracy , even pollution in these states , or funding science projects there , infrastructure , re-entry and training of work force etc. 
  stuff that honestly just help the local people , and without which we can just as well keep our interest in those countries . 
  i 'd much rather see such social funds allocated to fellow non-eu europeans , is what i meant . 
  cheeky scot . 
  you seem to jump from what we talk about in each post . 
  when i restrict the topic to where the eu should send its aid , as it is a * european * organisation above all - to other european countries , you move the question to why should france or the uk help other european countries they feel less connected to than some non-european ones . 
  and use my metaphore for the family-neighbourhood etc. 
  to imply these nations might not feel , say the modlovans , as their family more so than the tunisians . 
  i say fine , we can discuss this aspect - and answer you why i consider `` family-neighbourhood '' etc. 
  to be based on certain traits - raligious , racial , ethnic etc. 
  and then suddenly you go back to my original framework of the discussion - purely the eu as an organisation . 
  mate , make up your mind what you want to discuss . 
  who should the eu , purely as an organisation , consider more suitable for its help , or who should separate members within it consider closer and more a part of their `` family '' . 
  because those two rarely converge - india might be much closer to the british historically than say , serbia , but the eu as an organisation is certainly more meant to aim at latter than the former . 
  then we view the world differently , and both our sides are subjective . 
  to me , religious , racial and cultural groups are always closer than historical connections . 
  bulgaria has nothing to do with the irish but i consider them part of the same group - historically christian , white , part of european civilization based on greco-roman , medieval christian and renaissance-enlightement heritage . 
  as opposed to the turkish , with whome historically we have a ton in common , yet share few of these basic traits . 
  if you have the opposite view and historical state-connections are more important than the fundamental civilizational , religious and racial traits , i can see how tunisia would seem closer a family than say , the serbs . 
  but that 's a world view i ca n't change now , nor can you change mine . 
  a matter of priorities . 
  i did n't say it would . 
  nor did i argue what sovereign states should do with the help they decide to send , but instead argued about where eu money should go . 
  you were the one talking of uk/france in particular , which does n't exactly have to do with my arguments on where the structural funds of the entire union 's `` neighbourhood policy '' should go - towards morocco/algiers/tunisia / turkey/azerbayjan or moldova/ukraine/bosnia / other european states . 
  we do both already . 
  i merely say we should not do the social part , but redirect it to poor european non-eu countries instead . 
  then leave the ** european ** union and make a union with them . 
  i 'm saying what an organisation called the european union , based on this continent , should do . 
  not what individual nations decide to . 
  the second option does nothing . 
  social funds spread the money among millions of ciizens with little to no effect , as the funds are n't that big to being with . 
  wheras givint to the regime directly makes it do what we need geo-politically , such as stopping migrant waves for example . 
  as did gaddafi by the way when we paid him to . 
  the logic is far fetched enough to justify sending money to any part of the world . 
  in theory . 
  in practice , our goals are very much geo-political in these countries , and can be achieved with funding the regimes alone . 
  whereas our social funds are such a drop in the bucket , they certainly do n't lower poverty enough in these countries with combined more than 200 million people to actually deterr that much de-stabilisation . 
  and certainly no terrorism at all , since terrorists in europe have been exclusively home grown . 
  we 're just spilling money across a wide range of non-european countries with minimal effect in each of these states , instead of concentrating it all on say , just moldova and ukraine - the poorest on our continent , where the effects would be both much more immediate and towards our own continent . 
  but why ? 
  what 's my comment to do with american nationalism or trump ? 
  no such thing as european responsibility for any region outside of europe . 
  no such thing as eu responsibility for the well-being of any nation that is n't in europe . 
  charity begins at home . 
  you take care of your family first . 
  then your neighbourhood . 
  then your city . 
  then your country . 
  then your region , then continent , then earth . 
  not the other way around . 
  when no more people live in abject poverty in europe , * then * should european taxpayers send money to the whole region . 
  ( north africa , mid-east , caucasus ) when no more people are poor in the region ( north africa , mid-east , caucasus ) * then * send money further afar to africa and asia . 
  that 's how it should work . 
  every state should first take care of itself , then of its neighbours , then further afar , same as with each individual person . 
  if everyone did that the world would begin fixing much faster . 
  sorry , i did n't get your comment , what nationalism ? 
  that is true , but only as long as structural funds are concerned . 
  the eu 's neghbourhood policy also allocates lots of funds fighting poverty , illiteracy , even pollution in these states , or funding science projects there , infrastructure , re-entry and training of work force etc. 
  stuff that honestly just help the local people , and without which we can just as well keep our interest in those countries . 
  i 'd much rather see such social funds allocated to fellow non-eu europeans , is what i meant . 
  i do n't think the eu can absorb yet another member , especially as big and poor as ukraine , in a time of uncertainty for the union 's future as now . 
  but i am apalled it pours such huge ammounts of funds into non-european countries like morocco , azerbayjan , tunisia and turkey . 
  i 'd rather see all those money go towards the poorest countries of our fellow europeans , like moldova , ukraine and serbia , even if the union is n't capable of accepting them yet . 
  so from what i understand in this thread is that the problem was not that the greeks are lazy , but that they are * greedy * . 
  they were eager to demand lots of social benefits , more sallaries and increases , protesting for those things eagerly , but at the same time hid taxes en mass , did n't ask for/give receipts etc. 
  do i get the right impression - the greeks are n't lazy , they are actually quite hard-working , but the work they put was towards hiding taxes whilst demanding social benefits ? 
  when russians are n't political and butthurt they are superbly funny and witty . 
  you ' v got it the other way around - ** you 're ** not wellcome in eastern europe . 
  the arogant russian feeling of entitlement to control over other people 's countries is pathetic and a valid reason why you ' r dsiregarded as scum in this part of the world . 
  nothing outside of your borders is part of `` your zone of influence '' or `` backyard '' where a balance of powers should be kept . 
  nato is n't `` expanding '' - countries are willingly joining it because of your centuries of expansionism into them , yet you are supposedly `` the victims '' ? 
  pathetic . 
  truly a pathetic people the russians . 
  in many countries , such as mine , politicians * are * the bosses and ceos in big corps or banks . 
  simultaniously also the bosses of the crime rings .
