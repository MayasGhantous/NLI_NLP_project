  precisely for the results . 
  that 's what nations are . 
  if we do n't have them , if we do n't care for anything but to live nicely as just `` people '' , there 's no reason to live in a country that 's not among the best in the world . 
  no reason to stay there , fight corruption and stupidity , struggle and build it up . 
  you just pack up and emigrate . 
  nationalism first of all tells people `` this is our team , we must be loyal to it , we must do all in our powers to make it do as good as the others '' . 
  so people stay in their state , no matter how bad it is , and work to make it better . 
  that 's what happened in bulgaria after our lbieration at the end of the 19th century - everyone was extremely nationalistic , so tehy went to the west to study and then came back to develop this backwards ottoman province . 
  the country prospered - it was `` the balkan miracle '' and by 1912 an increadibly developped nation , almost to the western standards . 
  through nationalism . 
  today , there 's no nationalism here almost at all . 
  and so people do n't give a fuck . 
  they leave , the country loses massive human captial , espeically the young , and is on the verge of collapse . 
  those who remain have no nationalism either , so they do n't really care that our neighbours do better , they do n't try to emulate romania 's anti-corruption struggle for example , but just give up on the people and say `` we 're just a shitty country , we ca n't ever do it '' . 
  nationalism in that sense is like the strong motivation of a team , the loyalty to it , the driving force behind improving shitty countries . 
  without it , people just give up on those societies and leave . 
  i think the sad truth is we need very strong immigration sanctions , pretty much closed borders , to be established in the `` draining '' economies of germany and the uk , for our own sake . 
  it sounds absolutely ridiculous - but maybe it would even be best if they kept their borders open * only * to non-eu countries , so they get the workers they need . 
  but close them precisley to those eu countries under severe demographic threat , as to allievate the problem . 
  if , say , portugal has no right to free immigration to countries that are richer than it , the young protoguese will stay there and not move to poorer ones outseide the eu . 
  i know it breaks the principle of free movement in eu , but sometimes the very life and existance of the nation is more important . 
  the idea of a being bulgarian is n't connected to a blood tie , as much as it is to identigying with the history of the nation , speaking the language as mother tongue , and being loyal to a state called bulgaria , which has its roots 1300 years ago . 
  these simple 3 ideas hold the nationality as continuous entity . 
  you just ca n't compromise either of these without destroying it as a concept . 
  and no bulgarian in the world , safe from some quite radical anti-national marxists , would be ok with destroying the concept of our nation . 
  well we see the problem as twofold here . 
  one is the nationalist side , not that we are a small nation , we never were large , but that the country is less * bulgarian * and more gypo-turkish , when they constitute a good 12-13 % right now , and will more in the future since they do n't emigrate as much and have high fertility . 
  it 's the fear of losing the country we inherited and identity to other ethnic/identity groups . 
  you ca n't really fix taht with immigrants , at least not with such that would n't fully assimilate into bulgarian indetity/culture within a generation or two . 
  hence why i support immigrants from ukraine , moldova , macedonia , serbia etc. 
  not from outside of europe . 
  the second is the economic . 
  how does an economy function when there are as many people on pension as those working/paying those pensions ? 
  true , which is why i am furious at our laws forbidding more than 10 % of people in a company to be foreigners . 
  supposedly it aims at protecting jobs , but in reality it prevents us from getting huge ammounts of people from ukraine and moldova . 
  especially in the it sector that is absolutely starved of human capital and ready to bring over thousands from these countries on very high wages . 
  if we 'd drop those laws we can gets lots of people from turkey , ukraine , moldova , macedonia , albania , bosnia and serbia . 
  ( granted , worsening their demographic crisis , but it is how it is ), 
  well in reality 1 million left as soon as the borders were open , by 1995 . 
  from the other 1 million 300,000 are due to our low fertility rate , 700,000 left in the past 20 years . 
  the tendency is getting smaller as the country develops , but what we truly face as worrying is the ageing , where we are on par with japan and germany . 
  they , however , have the economy and money to pay for it . 
  we do n't . 
  precisely the same number of people that we lost over the last 20 years . 
  :( 9 million to 7 right now . 
  a demographic catastrophy whilst others thrive , this post depresses me . 
  leopold butchered 10 million people to get rich . 
  there are people in belgium . 
  why do you need to share an ethnicity/language/whatever other trait with victims to feel connected to them and disgusted by the appraisal of their butcher ? 
  the graph is bullshit towards smaller states , we [ exported eur 403 milion ] ( http://postimg.org/image/kmcaqbdst/ ) worth of weapons in 2014 , more this year , and are shown as 0 on the graph . 
  i know , the graph is bullshit towards smaller states , we [ exported eur 403 milion ] ( http://postimg.org/image/kmcaqbdst/ ) worth of weapons in 2014 , more this year , and are shown as 0 on the graph . 
  as with the rest of the underdevelopped , unsustainably increasing regions : they 'll migrate to europe . 
  wild animals inside the megapolis ? 
  pigeons and rats maybe ? 
  yet , by avoiding actual iron courtain regimes your country is n't literary scarred by thousands of disguting brutalist blocks and has preserved its historic architectural charm . 
  that 's one thing we ca n't fix in eastern europe for a century to come , regardless of economic activity . 
  dude , putin came up with official statement a few months ago himself stating the `` crimea operation '' was put in motion weeks before it ocurred and there were russian troops deployed well before the referendum . 
  ( which was obvious ) you do n't even keep up with the official kremlin position when regurgitating earlier rt version . 
  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-31796226 ( listen to putin 's own words from the interview if you do n't trust this source ), 
  i do n't want to derail the topic or do a `` whataboutism '' , cause i do n't really care for ther serbs and karadzic , but fyi belgium has had a main boulevard in its capital called leopold ii for decades , and no one gives a fuck . 
  he killed aprox . 
  10 million people in comparisson to karadzic , yet the capital of the eu is perfectly fine with its central boulevard bearing his name . 
  just googled it - turns out there 's a ton of leopold ii hotels , restaurants , streets and statues in belgium . 
  this man killed 10 million people entirely for personal profit and karadzic is considered a scandal : [ 10 million ] ( http://www.brusselspictures.com/wp-content/photos/leopold2/leopoldiistatue.jpg ) [ 10 million ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2d/leopold_ii_gent.jpg ) [ 10 million ] ( http://assets.brusselsremembers.com/images/big/223.jpg?1361803925 ) [ 10 million ] ( http://static.newworldencyclopedia.org/thumb/3/34/mons_-_l%c3%a9opold_ii_-_vtdj.jpg/220px-mons_-_l%c3%a9opold_ii_-_vtdj.jpg ), 
  or , you know , more comfortable life just makes ideologies of mysery , poverty and guilt somewhat unnecessary ? 
  2 billion christians around the world today somehow show the church is n't viewed as a `` bigoted religious institutions with blood on their hands '' . 
  not by those it helps at least . 
  or even better return straight to the catholic church ? 
  wheras with some of the lowest here in bulgaria , we ' r absolutely prospering . 
  by the same logic once the living wages and life standards go higher the corporations leave , so let 's keep me low ? 
  no , foreign investment brings capital into the economy , regardless if it 's taxed or not , and helps prop it up long term . 
  if they eventually leave is inevitable , the point is to have them in the first place and to use their presence to establish permanent economic activity . 
  our export for example has soared in the past 10 years during the time we got large foreign investment , to twice that of serbia ( a comparable country to ours ) and the same size as that of greece ( 30 % more people there , 4 times the economy ) . 
  only partially true - some of us would admit it . 
   but you did n't disprove my initial argument , your initial argument was that because bulgaria was a nazi country , the macedonians did n't like us . 
  out of this i argued with only the first claim - bulgaria being a nazi country , and certainly disproved it with the list of arguments i gave you as to what constitues a national-socialist country , none of which you addressed . 
  simply because in your mind , as in many uneducated people , `` nazi '' has become meaningless - just an insult . 
  it 's not a precise political structure , which bulgaria never had , no - to you it 's just `` a bad country '' . 
  a child 's level of understanding . 
  you then decided to change the argument to `` bulgaria was allied to the nazis '' - which is neither something i ' v argued against , nor something that makes a country nazi itself . 
   you just insulted me in every one of your posts do n't recall that . 
  if insulting your nation for brainwashing you with propaganda as to what `` nazi '' means , then this is neither personal nor something you did n't do to me . 
  please quote the insults you claim . 
   and spat a bunch of chavinistic nonsense while arguing semantics basically . 
  lol , so now it 's `` semantics '' what to call nazi and what not . 
  no my friend , it 's semantics to you precisely because of what i wrote above - you are from the people who use nazi as an adjective , a slur for countries or people you do n't like . 
  i am arguing historical terminology - nazi , or national-socialist is a very specific type of government bulgaria never had . 
  if arguing `` semantics '' is this , then we can easily call the uk `` communist '' in ww2 because it was allied to the soviet union and accuse those who disagree with this of simply `` arguing semantics '' . 
   but i understand you , i would also be pissed if my country was allied with nazis , the biggest evil in human history . 
  i feel ya brah . 
  :'( now we 're back to the argument of bulgaria being allied to the nazis . 
  :d you are really confused . 
  which is it finally - bulgaria was a national-socialist state , or it was just allied to one ? 
  i know you have to wiggle like that to avoid the actual arguments from the period , but c'mon , have some dignity . 
   also i said that bulgarian soldier `` looks like a nazi '' , cause he is wearing actual nazi uniform you smart person you . 
  yes you did , as an argument for bulgaria being a national socialiste state . 
  proper strong argument there , you smart person . 
  did you know many soviet soldiers wore american helmets throught the lend-lease ? 
  proper argument to call the ussr a `` capitalist democracy '' i guess . 
   and btw your comment is deleted , you just do n't see it .
