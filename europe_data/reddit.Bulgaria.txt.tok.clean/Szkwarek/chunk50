  ( 400,000 only in bulgaria ) more than laughably low , it 's actually the fault of the turks themselves . 
  they invade countries of others , they bring their people and armies over , they assimilate locals , and then they complain of the aftermath ? 
  what ? 
  would you laugh at belgians complaining how many people ( including soldiers at that ) they lost in the congo ? 
  poor colonist invaders . 
  so even when the victims are turkish or muslim , they were only possible because of the turkish invasion in the first place . 
  like when you go into someone 's home and get killed , versus when someone enters your home and kills you . 
  the two deaths are n't the same , because they are both the fault of the one invading the home . 
  in a place without muslims or turks originally like the balkans , where these only came through the ottoman invasion , all deaths resulting from muslim/turkish conflict with the locals is the fault of those who created this situation - the turks . 
  no one forced you to come to the balkans , to conquer , to assimilate and islamise , to create communities of privileged muslims who ruled over the locals as second class citizens . 
  a muslim could kill a person in bulgaria and only be punished by his own court , which usually was nothing more than paying reparation to the family of the killed . 
  but if a bulgarian killed a muslim he was sued by the muslim court and usually executed . 
  for centuries the muslims and turks were the privileged colonial class that oppressed the locals , and yet somehow you expect a good tratement at the end ? 
  all those deaths resulting from what the ottoman empire created are on its own hands . 
  not on ours . 
  we did n't ask for this , we did n't inaded anatolia or brought your people over . 
  whereas the armenian genocide is turks killing people inside their own , ancestral homeland that they lived in for more than 2000 years . 
  it 's not the same thing when occupied people kill the ocupators and vice versa . 
  both those deaths are on the hands of the ocupator who came there and created the situation in the first place . 
  people are mostly atheist in many homophobic countries . 
  albania , bulgaria , russia etc. 
  it 's almost as if naturally occuring negative human traits get pinned on religion all the time !, 
  ** gender dysphoria ** or ** gender identity disorder ** ( gid ) is the actual psychological condition of being trans . 
  it 's exactly what the scientific community uses as an official terminology . 
  before calling people full of shit because your ideology does n't match their factology , try to inform yourself first . 
  some proper ottoman apologetics right there . 
  how is it every time a turk talks of the empire he regurgitates the same old story . 
  education is proper standardized in turkey , eh ? 
  it was n't the local christians who decided to have religion base their identity politics , it was the ottoman empire itself . 
  its system did precisely that - the muslim `` millet '' was the privileged , accepted group . 
  the others were second class citizens . 
  hence when someone converts to islam , he himself choses to set himself apart from his people , to betray them , to join the invaders . 
  not the christians revering to `` religious hatred '' - the did n't target jews for example and the jews in bulgaria were even saved during ww2 . 
  hence it was n't based on religion , it was based on a group , which set itself apart based on its muslim religion , conquering and then oppressing the local balkan christians . 
  those who joined that group set themselves willingly apart from their people and joined the invader . 
  but somehow the occupied nations were supposed to overlook that and say `` hey , they are actually locals who just changed their religion , they should stay ! '' ? 
  what ? 
  secondly , stop with the myth of the mass expulsion or even more so murder of muslims and turks from the balkans . 
  there still are 800,000 in bulgaria alone , and 400,000 left themsleves during the 80s , so there were 1,200,000 here by that time , despite the ottoman census right before our liberation saying there are 560,000 muslims inside the current territory of bulgaria . 
  not only were they not expelled or murdered , they doubled in numbers under bulgarian rule . 
  as for the policy of kicking muslims out still `` in swing in modern bulgaria '' , i wo n't even comment this complete bullshit . 
  not only is no one kicking them out , they are super priviliged , with their ethnic party ( which is technically unconstitutional ) , being the strongest one in the country - through its links with the oligarchs . 
  they are in every single parliament and completely get all they want . 
  their regions are priviliged and suck our budget through tobacco subsidies and disproportional eu grants . 
  finally , the light handed attitude of `` hey , the ottoman empire was chill , yes it destroyed your states , islamised a third of the balkans , kept you in a civilizational bubble for centuries that denied you taking part in the developments on the rest of the continent ... but was n't * that * bad '' is disgusting . 
  go say to the algerians how much roads the french built and how great medicine they brought - was n't all * that * bad to be a colony . 
  maybe if turkey was divided and occupied after ww1 by the colonial powers like they initially planned would n't be all * that * bad either . 
  i wonder what would happen to their colonists and assimilated locals at the end of it ... 
  no , i do n't believe it will promote transsexuality as a healthy condition , i can read that it will in the article : `` promote measures to advance lgbti equality '' . 
  i am very much against the discrimination and ridicule of bollimic people too . 
  but if there was a proposal that included both tackling that discrimination , * and * promoting the acceptance as bollimia as something perfectly normal , i 'd oppose it . 
  as i am sure you would too . 
  if it was just lgb i 'd understand the proposal , but putting trans there as well is what makes this wrong . 
  trans is a mental disorder , likened by psychologists to other body-related disorders like bollimia . 
  they should never be discriminated or attacked , but neither should a disorder be promoted as healthy . 
  they need help , not promotion or dsicrimination . 
  armenia is n't your motherland . 
  it was armenian for more than 2000 years , before your people even left central asia . 
  your people were colonials in armenia , same as in the balkans . 
  that 's like the french who fought in algiers to keep it saying they were defending `` their motherland '' . 
  it was the armenians trying to get and invader out of * their * motherland , of thousands of years , occupied by your people . 
  and they butchered for it . 
  the turkish priviliged colonials who were brought to the balkans to rule over the `` giaurs '' and did so for centuries ? 
  you get what you ask for . 
  no one from the balkans came to anatolia to kill your people - you came here to kill and conquer ours . 
  how did you expect it 's gon na end ? 
  same with the armenians - you went into their land which had been armenian for more than 2000 years , from before turks left east asia . 
  the difference in all these cases is that the aggressor is always the turks , so even when the victims are turkish , they were only possible because of the turkish invasion in the first place . 
  like when you go into someone 's home and get killed , versus when someone enters your home and kills you . 
  the two deaths are n't the same , because they are both the fault of the one invading the home .

  what genocide against the turks is being ignored ? 
  they just vanished i suppose ? 
  in thin air . 
  floods every winter destroy areas and sometimes cost lives . 
  these municipalities , one of the poorest in bulgaria , can only take care of the problem through eu funding . 
  eu funding tied to turkey partnership . 
  turkey refusing partnership , even though the floods hurt their province more ( the rivers come from bulgaria ) , unless bg municipalities refuse to accept a historic fact . 
  it 's blackmail . 
  `` either you abide by our history narrativ , or your people and provinces keep suffering floods '', 
  maybe he 's talking about the golden horde ? 
  maybe he 's talking about ivan the terrible ? 
  fair enough , for some things i agree - mainly nominal stuff that need international payment , such as vacations anywhere in the world or the newest car . 
  but for internal , everyday life , it comes pretty close . 
  an upper middle class person in bulgaria can enjoy the same quality of food on a daily basis , in the same quality restaurants as someone in the uk , the same size , great location and quality of furniture home , the same quality and frequency of entertainment , spa , massages , golf on sundays etc. 
  all those things exist with the same quality in poorer countries , and are affordable by the local middle upper class , even if vacations on the bahams aren ; t , . 
  but why are we talking of upper middle class western europeans , as if upper middle class is defined there ? 
  every state has upper middle class , depending on it . 
  i argued with 1500 eur you can be upper middle class here . 
  if the upper middle class of w. europe does n't see what you get here for 1500 eur as enough for them , is quite irrelevant to whether the people here on 1500 eur are upper middle class in our context . 
  my argument was bangladesh is overpopulated . 
  by a lot . 
  in comparisson to russia , which it has 20 million people more , 64.000 sq.
