  is nothing . 
  like a dot on the map of it , hence you are being ridiculously pedantic with our correction in this context . 
  by the same logic you can never really say x country is as big as y , because they never actuall are . 
  context matters , otherwsie you ' r just trying to be a smartass . 
  you do n't need to go to other countries to enjoy [ this ] ( http://www.bulgariainside.com/images/galleries/th_641x426/_w_7e5e12d59508e644c07936373df6a024.jpeg ) when it * is * your country . 
  ( pic , sveti vlas resort here in bulgaria . 
  my grandma went there for 5 days last summer . 
  i prefer [ this ] ( http://web-tourism.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5.jpeg ) - bansko . 
  you can vacation on average bulgarian sallary on our seaside and mountain resorts , that have no less of a quality than medditeranean or alpine ones where westerners spend thousands ), 
  lol , that was really fun . 
  i compare the population of bangladesh to that of russia - that it has 20 million more people despite being only a very , very small country , for which i used austira . 
  you give the sound argument that no , actually , it is 1.5 times bigger than austria . 
  :d the fact you don ; t realize how hilarious this is makes me giggle . 
  160 million people in teh size of austria makes my argument for overpopulation work . 
  160 million in 1.5 the size of austria it seems does n't . 
  first hand , yes . 
  my second hand iphone 5 was never used , some brat didn ; t like her birthday gift , and i got for 190 bgn - 98 eur from a pawn shop . 
  have i complained that foreign companies should pay more to bulgarians ? 
  then why mention it ? 
  and empathy has nothing do with what we talk of . 
  you make companies pay more to those people - the companies move to one of the other highly overpopulated and poor countries . 
  you stop buying their products - they close their factories . 
  which of these two proposals i ' v read here will make the lives of these employed better ? 
  here goes the `` muuh colonialism '' argument . 
  will be used for ever and ever it seems . 
  before you address the effect of overpopulation in third world countries , it 's pointless to talk . 
  everything boils down to it , and yet we have to go back in history to justify it somehow . 
  a worthless comment . 
  you sound like a dumbass for it . 
  if prices are low enough to get you on 1500eur as much as 3500eur would elsewhere , why not ? 
  a cab fare here costs 0.45 eur a kilometre and a fist-class sushi uro-maki combo meal at the restaurant next to my place - 5.50 eur . 
  on 1500 eur you can certainly live like an upper-middle class person does in the uk or france . 
  hence why just as big a percentage of our population earns that much as those who earn 5000 eur + in the uk/france . 
  people are n't suffering because companies made them work fo 23p an hour , they are suffering because they overpopulate their countries to the point where the rise in the economy , development and real wages does n't cope with the creation of new workforce . 
  making it cheaper and cheaper . 
  they take 23p , because if they demand more - there 's 3 billion other people on earth right now ready to take their place . 
  why is there 3 billion people living in abject poverty ? 
  there were only 4 billion on earth quite recently and many parts of the globe have n't increased substantially since then ? 
  well , because other parts have . 
  by a lot . 
  by an uncontrolable population boom . 
  ** this ** is what causes the poverty in these regions . 
  not companies that go there to employ people . 
  it 's both hilarious and pathetic to see deluded western leftists blame the suffering and poverty of people in countries like bangladesh on the western companies that have went there to invest , or even more so on the western customers who buy the produce of these companies , rather than on the people who ' v made a country the size of austria have a population larger than that of russia . 
  ( by 20 million more ) if you want to help them , not buying the products they produce is n't the way . 
  it will just make the jobs already scarce there even scarcer . 
  you wann help ? 
  send them contraceptives . 
  bangladesh is a country the size of austria with the population of russia ( actually 20 million more than russia ) . 
  regardless if their fertility has been dealt with now , do n't tell me it 's not an example of a country having low standards precisely due to overpopulation . 
  it 's ** the ** prime example of overpopulation in the world , which is why those people working for 23p an hour have tens of millions of others ready to take their jobs . 
  their education is n't my responsibility or that of the companies that bring jobs to their countries . 
  once again it 's their own responsibility . 
  stop treating third world countries like children that need to be taken care of by the west . 
  why are you asking me if i 'd overlook toxicity in my clothes ? 
  what does that have to do with my post ? 
  toxicity affects me negatively , hence i would n't be ok with it . 
  paying as low as possible to workers ( who have chosen to work there ) is affecting me positively . 
  why should n't i be ok with it ? 
  because i 'm supposed to pay out of my own pocket for the better life of people in the third world , whilstthey keep increasing by the billions ? 
  grow up . 
  a company is supposed to do all it can to decrease it costs , as long as it is within the law . 
  if the law says 23p an hour is legal , there is zero reason to pressure a company to pay more . 
  you want to pay more money out of your pocket ? 
  then there 's plenty of charities for you to send your money to in the third world . 
  just do n't force everyone else to pay more as well . 
  i did n't understand what you wrote . 
  be a bit more clear please . 
  did you even address what we are talking about ? 
  stalin made a common border with hitler and carved eastern europe with him . 
  he 's to blame for ww2 as much as hitler is . 
  be as clear in your response as i am in these sentences , because vague , poorly constructed words i do n't get . 
  maybe it 's my english , sorry . 
  but why should western customers demand better conditions for the workers in these countries ? 
  would n't that make it more expensive for the western customers ? 
  and is n't it the work of people in those countries to demand better conditions for themslves , not that of the customers in the west ? 
  why are people working for less than a dollar a day ? 
  are they forced ? 
  they would be fired and replaced easily . 
  why ? 
  because labour is cheap . 
  why ? 
  because they are breeding like rabbits , so the economy and internal companies ca n't cope with increase of people , hence leaving a constant large supply of people rady to work for any money . 
  when people in poor countries stop breeding like that , unemployment will fall drastically , labour will become more expensive because there wo n't be substantially more extra poor people with each generation . 
  western companies and consumers do n't owe them shit . 
  of course every company wants to pay as little as possible to people . 
  there are those willing to work for so little ? 
  great !, 
  i 'd hire them too . 
  the question is why are there hundreds of millions willing to work for close to nothing on earth , and the answer is because we ' v got 3 billion people more than we did a couple of generations ago . 
  those are the cheap labour - the extra billions of people as result of uncontrolable breeding by those least capable of giving their children a secure future . 
  according to the un africa is set to ** quadruple ** to 4 billion people by 2100 . 
  that 's another 3 billion just in africa ready to work for close to nothing . 
  you think companies won ; t use that ? 
  or that they should n't use that ? 
  that we should insist paying more for our goods ? 
  fix your own damn country do n't insist consumers elsewhere pay more to fix it for you . 
  start with contraception . 
  poroshenko was n't in office during the first battle of donetsk airport , when the interior of the terminal was destroyed . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_battle_of_donetsk_airport nice pointing the finger tactic though .
