  your kind never gets ashamed from using it . 
  how could hitler attack the su in 1939 if he did n't have a border with it ? 
  there was poland in between , and it had an alliance with the west that was honoured . 
  when i talk of hitler fighting on two fronts i meant uk/france on one and poland on the other . 
  you seem to forget that the very reason he did n't have to do that was because the ussr attacked poland from behind with hitler , destroying their entire defence plan on the vistula river , and ensuring hitler could quickly turn his armies west to fight only on one front . 
  the very reason the ussr had a border with hitler was because it made that border when attacking poland with him . 
  i know they lie to you in russia that ww2 began in 1941 , but maybe it 's about time you actually looked past soviet propaganda as to when the war actually began and who started it - hitler together * with * stalin . 
  and the russians only fought back thanks to the massive lend-lease that enabled them to do so in the first two years , when it was the closest to defeat . 
  the ussr would have to cope without the 11,000 us carriages and 1966 locomotives in the prouction of its own carriages and locomotives first , on a sufficient numbers , before even beginning to use those to supply their factories for the production of armaments . 
  instead it could straight away start producing armaments thanks to the us logistical help . 
  this was n't `` nothing '' , because those armaments they immediately started producing barely saved them in 1942 and 1943 . 
  without them , due to a significant delay caused by lack of the immediate us logistical supply , they would surely lose to the wehrmacht in 1942 or 1943 . 
  it came close as it is in stalingrad with all the massive us help that had already come for 1 year . 
  what does their lack or presence of illusions about hitler 's plans have to do with what i wrote ? 
  the ussr did carve up eastern europe with him . 
  they did help him destroy the west by supplying huge ammounts of resource and securing his eastern border , so he could focus all there . 
  a small , surrounded germany was only able to avoid fighting on two fronts and destroy all opposition on the continent thanks to the ussr . 
  in 1939 hitler was helpless against a joint war of france/uk from the west and poland from the east . 
  even more so if the ussr also fought him in the east . 
  he became a danger only thanks to the ussr securing him nicely the east in a joint carve up . 
  thus also incidentally making a common border with him , which he then used to invade . 
  you kinda get what you looked for , right ? 
  those 20 million dead russians are as much to be blamed on stalin as they are on hitler . 
  it 's just a shame that us eastern european states had to pay for the mistakes of germans and russians with the war first and then shitty communism/even shittier post communism . 
  read the whole thing above . 
  the ready goods and equipment they sent equal 10 % of what the russians produced themselves during hte war . 
  but they would n't be able to produce any of that without a logistical base to transport their raw resources to their factories , their ready goods to the front line and their supplies back and forth . 
  the lend-lease was immediate with the delivery of around 70,000 vehicles in early 1942 alone , which enabled the destroyed soviet vehicle park to actually operate the production , supply and transport . 
  i wonder exactly how would the ussr produce anything near what it did , and needed , if not for the half a million us vehicles or the enormous production material . 
  how would all those tanks not only be produced , but more importantly - transported to the front , when the ussr produced barely 1000 carriages ( after losing more than 60 % in barbarossa ) , and was given 11,000 by the us ? 
  pretty much all tanks , ammunition , men and supplies were brought from the far east and ural mountain factories to the front-line on us carriages , pulled by us locomotives . 
  the ussr would not be merely delayed , it would be put to a hold without the logistical support that was given through the lend-lease , and a ussr put on hold is a ussr defeated by the wehrmacht . 
  already wrote more on this here : https://bg.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4ae610/bbc_news_putin_orders_most_troops_out_of_syria/d10jggw, 
  what he mean by `` russia did '' is the war there in the first place . 
  the supply of weapons to separatists that it trained and organised , in order to have another `` transnistria-abkhazia-ossetia '' like conflict . 
  the subsequent firing from both sides that actually destroyed the infrastructure is the direct result of russia instigating this war there . 
  he meant crimea . 
  more . 
  they needed us trucks , locomotives and carriages to even begin their production and supply . 
  1000 soviet carraiges produced for the whole war vs. 11,000 brought from the us - almost the entire soviet supply to the factories and from them to the frontline was done on us carriages pulled by us locomotives . 
  ( 1966 such in total ), 
  the role lend-lease was immediate with the delivery of around 70,000 vehicles in early 1942 alone , which enabled the destroyed soviet vehicle park to actually operate the production , supply and transport . 
  i wonder exatly how would the ussr produce anything near what it did , and needed , if not for the half a million us vehicles or the ennourmous production material . 
  how would all those tanks not only be produced , but more importantly - transported to the front , when the ussr produced barely 1000 carriages ( after losing more than 60 % in barbarossa ) , and was given 11,000 by the us ? 
  pretty much all tanks , ammunition , men and supplies were brough from the far east and ural mountain factories to the frontline on us carriages , pulled by us locomotives . 
  the ussr would not be merely deleyed , it would be put to a hold without the logistical support that was given through the lend-lease , and a ussr put on hold is a ussr defeated by the wehrmacht . 
  it was the opinion of my history professor alexander chobanov at cov uni , the opinion of all the historians and economists i read to write my thesis on barbarossa , and the simple `` opinion '' of the numbers we have from the war , like some of those i gave above . 
  many things in history are subjective , numbers are n't . 
  1000 soviet carriages produced in the entire war would n't get a tenth of their logistics going , and that 's just one of the many areas where they were helpless without us lend lease . 
  he 's also a really old billionaire who probably has a ton of other daily stuff to do , like enjoy his money and remaining months?year ? , than plot the demise of the world . 
  people are so fucking gullible . 
  you do n't need evil billionaire jews ( always jews ) to promote shitty ideas , there are more than enough morons who turn to such on their own and are eager to promote them without the backing of `` the new world order !!! 111 !! '', 
  so if they did it with massive and crucial help , it was n't all by themsleves was it ? 
  of which production how much was possible with the millions of tonnes of metal , steel and other resources brought over from the us ? 
  or in factories that were otufitted by us experts with the newest assembly lines ? 
  or by workers who only lived thanks to the millions of tonnes of food sent , during a time of famine that killed about 70 % of the 10 million civilian casualties ? 
  how much of all these resources were carried and factory production possible thanks to the 501,660 vechicles they were given , after the soviet army lost 58 percent of its vehicles in 1941 alone ? 
  or by the 1,900 steam locomotives and 66 diesel locomotives they received ? 
  soviet production would be pretty much non existent between 1941 and 1944 were it not for the logistical help from the us , and by the time they built their own 300,000 vehicles between 1943 and 45 - it would ' v been far too late . 
  we can go on like this for a long time , but in the end , the war effort of the soviets was a very complex process in which lend-lease took a central point , enabling many things that would be impossible and aiding in many others that would be far more difficult without . 
  considering how close the soviets came to the edge despite this massive help from the west , it 's quite safe to assume this help was at the very least big enough to tip the scales in their favour . 
  which really is n't my own interpretation , but that of russian historians themselves . 
  * the allies supplied 1900 locomotives to the ussr , while only 446 locomotives were produced in the country itself during the same period , as well as 11,000 carriages , while only a few more than 1,000 were made in the ussr . 
  it is impossible to imagine how the soviet economy would have functioned without these supplies . 
  for example , the telephone cable provided by the allies could wrap the earth at the equator . 
  * - professor oleg budnitsky, 
  i remember pretty well the whole poland-ukr euro , the videos advertising it , showing the stadiums and airports they built ( including this one ) , highways etc. 
  such , normality . 
  europe . 
  and suddeny fucking this . 
  it 's a bit surreal . 
  i think of war as something almost incompatible , impossible to modern europe . 
  yet it happened , so now i feel like it 's definitely better safe than sorry . 
  i have newfound appreciation for both militarisation of national armies/alliances , and democratic checks and balances of those in power . 
  we have to keep our own leaders on a tight leash ( unlike the people in russia ) so they do n't even imagine playing at war , whilst simultaniously be militarily prepared if our neighbours lose the grip on their own . 
  ( like the people in turkey have ), 
  i do n't think you are very well informed on either the scale of the lend-lease , or how close the ussr got to a defeat even with it . 
  * the allies supplied 1900 locomotives to the ussr , while only 446 locomotives were produced in the country itself during the same period , as well as 11,000 carriages , while only a few more than 1,000 were made in the ussr .

  * - professor oleg budnitsky roughly 17.5 million tons of military equipment , vehicles , industrial supplies , and food were shipped from the western hemisphere to the ussr , 94 % coming from the us . 
  the united states gave to the soviet union from october 1 , 1941 to may 31 , 1945 the following : 427,284 trucks , 13,303 combat vehicles , 35,170 motorcycles , 2,328 ordnance service vehicles , 2,670,371 tons of petroleum products ( gasoline and oil ) , 4,478,116 tons of foodstuffs ( canned meats , sugar , flour , salt , etc. 
  ) , 1,900 steam locomotives , 66 diesel locomotives , 9,920 flat cars , 1,000 dump cars , 120 tank cars , and 35 heavy machinery cars . 
   during the war , russia produced only 343,624 cars and lorries due to the heavy commitment of major automobile factories like gaz to armoured vehicle production . 
  the usa alone provided the russians with 501,660 tactical wheeled and tracked vehicles , including 77,972 jeeps , 151,053 1-1/2 - ton trucks , and 200,622 2-1/2 - ton trucks . 
  the aid was vital , not only because of the sheer quantity , but because of the quality . 
  while soviet automotive production concentrated almost exclusively on antiquated copies of american 1930 lorry designs , the vehicles provided under lend-lease were modern military designs with multiple powered axles and useful cross-country capability . 
  in addition , 15,631 artillery guns and 131,633 sub-machine guns were supplied by the allies to russia . 
  total of 14,833 us aircraft of all types were sent to russia between 1942 and 1944 . 
  lend-lease not only supplied the ussr directly with ready equipment , but was vital to soviet production , including of what you mentioned with the t-34 . 
  the us provided the ussr with ( in tonnes ) : cast iron : 6 927 000 tonnes armour sheets : 5 949 000 hot rolled steel : 173 035 cold rolled carbon steel : 121 480 tool steel - 34,652 high speed steel - 10,006 the cold-rolled steel sheet - 73,946 hot-rolled sheet steel - 20,8620 hot-rolled steel strip - 20,439 cold-rolled steel strip - 58,477 cold drawn steel drilling ( silverfish ) - 1044 of chrome-silicon - manganese steel zagotovka - 77,383 tinplate -108600 steel wire - 82,537 barbed wire - 33,720 stainless steel wire - 905.7 wire and allied armed forces - 3474 alloy steel wire - 151 steel ropes and steel cables -28,252 alloyed steel pipes - 41,173 from : \u041d . \u0418 . \u0420\u044b\u0436\u043a\u043e\u0432 , \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f : \u043b\u0435\u043d\u0434-\u043b\u0438\u0437 , \u0418\u0414 `` \u042d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430 '' , 2012 , \u0441\u0442\u0440 . 
  272 perhaps even more crucial was the food supply . 
  1.75 million tons of food were delivered , pretty much saving hundreds of thousands from starvation . 
  all of the above comes from russian sources i ' v used . 
  here 's an article from a russian historian on it : http://rbth.com/business/2015/05/08/allies_gave_soviets_130_billion_under_lend-lease_45879.html ** edit ** : wow , lots of people downvoting statistics . 
  this post has been jumping from plus 3 to minus 4 to plus 5 again like crazy . 
  if anyone finds the numbers above wrong i wholeheartedly would like to see corrections , for my own information in the future . 
  otherwise it seems you just downvote a fact of history you do n't find convenient for your narrativ . 
  no , it 's far more hilarious/stupid to think america won by itself ( not that i think many actually do believe that when it comes to europe ) . 
  but still , thinking the ussr stood any chance of survival without the lend-lease is ridiculous .
