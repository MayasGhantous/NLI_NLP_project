  there were 39,000 men , defending against 55,000 , inside a heavy fortification with more artilery and machine guns . 
  4 days later they were almost all killed , wounded or captured . 
  this is one event , just one massive battle that was meant to be a loss for the bulgarians when objectively judged as to the advantage the romanians had in defence , but turned out a victory . 
  for some reason , arguably a lack of arguments in defence of why the romanians lost such favourable conditions , you start mixing in the overall position of romania at the time in the whole war as if we talk of why it lost as a state , not this battle alone , and even further throw in the second balkan war , as if to say `` see the same happened to you '' . 
  do you know what a battle and a war are ? 
  in 1913 bulgaria did n't lose a battle like that , it fought against hte serbs and greeks before romania sending an army from an undefended front almost to sofia as you said . 
  a strategic defeat , without a single massive bulgarian military loss . 
  meanwhile , tutrakan was a lost battle , with no comparisson to the second balkan war . 
  hence , i get the feeling you are now just running away from an argument you started yourself when confronted with the reality that there was a battle where the romanian army performed quite poorly and the bulgarian one highly professionally . 
  should you have arguments to counter that about the actual battle i 'd love to discuss them , otherwise if we 'd just be throwing nationalist banter at each other by diverting the topic to the whole war or even other wars , i do n't really see the point . 
  39,000 men , with more machine guns and more artillery pieces than the attackers , in a heavily fortified stronghold with barbed wire stretching a few kilemtres , against only around 1.5 times more men , with fewer artilery guns and machine guns . 
  those are considerable odds in favour of the defender . 
  usually in history it would take 2-3 times more attackers to take a stronghold , but in the first world war this ratio was even bigger , with defending trenches giving a huge advantage than normal , sometimes 10-11 times larger forces would be needed for a breakthrough of even a few thousand men , not entire 39,000 . 
  for example at the battle of doiran , in a sector where 4000 bulgarians defended against 21,000 british , french and greek , the result was 2,250 casualties for the former and 12,000 for the latter , despite them dropping 100,000 shells on the bulgarians prior and having a between 2 and 3 times advantage in machine guns and mortars . 
  read on the other fronts of ww1 a bit , the defence technology was so ahead of the offence one up until the very end , that there was an insane advantage to defend positions and it usually was a carnage for the attackers . 
  for the bulgarians to capture a very strong fortress with only 1.5 ratio advantage and * fewer * guns and artilery , and actually capture that huge ammount of enemy troops was nothing short of a massive feat of arms . 
  it being done in just 4 days was close to a military miracle . 
  tutrakan  `` this name rings painfully in the ears of every romanian '' wrote their most influential historian of the war , `` it is linked to the greatest defeat of our holy war : a grievous , humiliating , ignominious defeat ... '' a good read on the subject : https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1g1-112797098/the-battle-of-turtucaia-tutrakan-2-6-september, 
  the westerners are stealing our balkan banter . 
  cultural appropriation !, 
  we should tell them they are gypsies you cheese eater !, 
  almost non existent during the actual assault , carried out by the bulgarians entirely - german casualties were 5 killed and 29 wounded for the whole battle , bulgarian ones were 1,517 killed , 7,407 wounded and 247 missing . 
  in turn , they killed/wounded 7,500 and captured 480 officers and 22,000 -- 28,000 romanians in a fortress described by august von mackensen as `` the verdun of the east '' and `` impregnable '' . 
  your last one is n't country specific . 
  in bulgaria we say ** `` the one who digs another man 's grave , falls in it himself '' ** ours that i ' v never heard elsewhere are : ** `` the vlachs drown at the end of the danube '' ** - a young one , from the battle of tutrakan in ww1 , denotes failing right before the very end of a process/action . 
  ** `` on a naked belly - couple of revolvers '' ** - when there 's no substance but a lot of show to something . 
  like when the base is lacking but you get the bonus/luxury regardless . 
  ** `` after rain - hood '' ** ( ca n't think of a more clever translation , this one 's literal ) - means you ' v `` put your hood on '' ( as in clothing ) only after the rain has fallen , ergo wetted you . 
  like taking a preventive measure after something bad has already happened . 
  another one is ** `` a hungry bear does n't dance '' ** - people do n't make anything without an incentive . 
  ** `` a unified band/gang ( druzhina ) lifts a mountain '' ** - pretty clear . 
  ** `` the interest shakes the fez ( turkish hat ) '' ** - this one rhimes in bulgarian ( interesa klati fesa ) and means ones interest leads his actions/decisions . 
  every positive post has a more quiet section from the ones about negative things . 
  in fact , any positive news at all gets usually less coverage and attention than the negative ones . 
  it 's not `` hurr durr russia victimized by unfair sub '' , it 's human nature . 
  go to the previous post here on `` german industrial production jumps to six-year high '' - it 's got like 2 or 3 comment threads and not that positive attitude either . 
  now open anything negative , about any country and compare . 
  thak you for the long response , i will take these questions to europemeta . 
  genuine question - is there a list of `` hate subreddits '' and is it an official reddit or r/europe rule not to mention any on that list ? 
  it 's the first time i hear people get reported for mentioning another subbreddit . 
  yes , i do think r/europe would be better off with those comments since they would be seriously downvoted and thus show the level of the subreddit . 
  whereas if they are n't downvoted , it will show the level nonetheless . 
  covering up something is never an excuse . 
  you ca n't artificially make the people of the subreddit better or worse . 
  cause that 's what a subreddit is - the people in it , not the mods . 
  leave all , let the upvote/downvote system measure how visible the comments are , not you . 
  personal insults and attacks towards other members are what ought to get people banned or censored . 
  aggressive political opinions should be left to be downvoted by the community . 
  it 's a matter of a community vs. a strictly managed from the top group . 
  does n't matter , deus vult heretic . 
  `` a parallel '' is drawn along the same lines . 
  ruthless rulers are filled all over history in each state , expanding the state , murdering subjugated people , exploiting colonies etc. 
  if this is what stalin is mostly acused of , then sure , a parallel with churchill . 
  but he is n't - he is accused of being a totalitarian tyrant , someone who was never elected but usurped power , then used it to crush all opposition , all dissent , mass slaughter politicians , burreacrats , military officials etc. 
  - all around him whom he saw as a threat . 
  then instituted various repressive measures against all citizens of his country , causing mass death to the people he 's supposed to govern . 
  where is the parallel with churchill ? 
  he did n't usurp power , he was elected . 
  ones elected , he was n't a tyrant - there was a functioning parliamentary system in the uk , an opposition , parties , free press , checks-and balances between the executive and legislative . 
  he did n't rule like a tyrant , did n't wield all executive and legislative power , did n't exacute opposition , did n't murder generals left and right , or send entire families of british opposition to camps , did n't open up concetration camps in scotland or england , his people were living normal , free lives . 
  all he did was be ruthless towards the colonies and in foreign policy , which puts him as a parallel to such standart ruthless rulers in history like wilhelm or napoleon , not with totalitarian tyrants like stalin or mao . 
  they are a separate category , so if you want to make a point about double standards point out to similar totalitarian tyrants in the west . 
  problem here is , there have n't been any in the 20th century because no country in the west succumbed to totalitarianism , have there ? 
  nor did eastern europe succumb either , it was forced to have such systems by the russian ocupators , which for some reason the serbs absolutely adore . 
  i understand your narrative , we have the same with northern dobrudja , which is now romania , but where our state was created . 
  however , what i was talking of was the demographic picture of the day - serbian ethnicity had moved north , centered around belgrade and bosnia at that time , with little presence in macedonia , where according to the last ottoman census there were 1147 bulgarian schools out of 1760 shools , the rest being serb , greek and aromanian . 
  it doesn ; t include the muslim ones , cause they were religious . 
  the population voted overwhelmingly in joining the bulgarian exarchate at the end of the 19th century . 
  our largest `` cheti '' operated there . 
  the largest national liberation organisation in the balkans , vmro , was filled with bulgarians and called - `` makedono-odrinska organziacja '' at some point , because it aimed to liberate the bulgarian people of macedonia and odrinsko - the two largest diasporas of ours abroad . 
  then come all the foreign estimates of ethnographs of the local population , and the ottoman archives . 
  it simply was an overwhelmingly bulgarian ethnic region at the time , regardless of its historical and cultural significance to other balkan nations , which no one here disputes . 
  that 's why our entire foreign policy in the 20th century was aimed at unification , and why we were forced to fight the serbs and greeks for it in all wars after 1912 . 
  history would ' v been very different had we united with about 25 % of our nation there . 
  precisely . 
  had they stayed catholic they 'd be building churches like [ that ( poland , built 2004 ) ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/liche%c5%84_bazylika_2.jpg ) . 
  not to start a nationalistic banter , it usually gets boring very fast , but in that case it 's funny that the situation is the opposite - macedonia was the [ heartland ] ( http://www.promacedonia.org/en/dr/dr_map_24.jpg ) of our [ ethnicity ] ( https://joshberer.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/balkans-1861-ethnic.jpg ) , which we went to war to unite with in the first place , whilst serbia only decided to take because it was not allowed to take albania in 1912 . 
  hence , kinda your greed caused us to fight on the sides we did in the 3 next wars . 
  as for odrin , i it 's a lost cause since our people there all left . 
  now it 's just full of turks . 
  unlike macedonia , where our people did n't leave , but just got brainwashed by the yugos to believe they are a magical , mythical nation older than earth and sons of alexander the great . 
   art can be a propaganda ( and very often is ) . 
  and yet is defined as art , whilst propaganda used for other things , despite the two terms intertwining often . 
  both of the following two examples are art and propaganda , but you would normally use propaganda first to describe [ this ] ( http://conspiracywiki.com/images/article/images/new-world-order-pyramid-of-power.jpg ) and art to describe [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/kurskaya_korennaya.jpg ) . 
  or are they both the same ? 
  both worthy of just being called `` propaganda '' ? 
   the narrative of this video is very clear : `` we are good , all troubles came form outside '' . 
  here a good example of me saying one ca n't understand the video if he 's unaware of the history . 
  it clearly showed the corrupt polish szlachta , mired in their estates `` bribing '' the poor commoners as the reason for the decline and fall of the commonwealth . 
  it is a vide animating the history and life of the polish state , hence naturally it will show foreign invaders , which you seem to hava a problem with , i 'd assume being from the nation most commonly among those foreign invaders . 
  no , i was learning history during my ba in history at coventry university and my ma in leuven . 
  this video is n't meant to teach you the history of poland in depth , as is clear by the fact nothing is spoken or written , hence incomprehensible what 's going on to those who do n't know the dates . 
  it 's meant to be a peace of art regarding polish history , and not all art is propaganda . 
  a beautiful paiting of a 17th century painter on a historical event is widely considered art , despite glorifying some aspect of the nation 's history . 
  this too falls in the cathegory of art much more so than propaganda , yet you chose to define it by the lesser interpretation of it , rather than the more obvious one . 
  hence the reason to suspect a personal agenda . 
  ( hurr durr the nasty russo-phobic poles show off their history in art form , it 's just propaganda ), 
  he means serb-stolen and yugo-brainwashed western bulgaria i believe . 
  gib green card pls . 
  as someone speaking bulgarian , polish and russian , i thank god we got rid of our cases every day .
