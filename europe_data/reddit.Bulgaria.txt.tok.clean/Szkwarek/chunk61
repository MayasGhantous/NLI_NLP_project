  it 's a very simple premise and a clearly defined religious theology . 
  it 's been such for 1700 years . 
  not difficult to grasp , unless one has a vested interrest in regurgitating a modern atheist propaganda entirely dependent on the listener 's complete ignorance of basic christian theology . 
  a basic `` i ' v nothing to say , but i lack the maturity to admit it or let go of an easy jab at your religion '' . 
  the catholic church has never had a change in its stance to the old testament , people just are ignorant of christian theology when they try using it as an argument . 
  it has always been the source of information on how things were before jesus and the things christ came to teach against . 
  there are parts christ claimed are true , like the 10 commandaments , and others he outright and directly rejected . 
   `` you have heard that it was said , ` an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth . ', 
  39 `` but i say to you , do not resist an evil person ; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek , turn the other to him also . 
  40 `` if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt , let him have your coat also . ... '' or  '' `` a new commandment i give to you , that you love one another , even as i have loved you , that you also love one another . 
  35 `` by this all men will know that you are my disciples , if you have love for one another . '' '', 
  and many more . 
  hence why he was branded by the jewish elders and accused of heresy , punishable by death . 
  the christian chuch is naturally the one that follows the teaching of christ , so the core of his ideology is that of the church - which is fundamentally one of peace , love and non-violence , overwriting any verses of the old testament that contradict that , same as jesus did when alive . 
  ( and why he was killed ) those verses of the old testament that do n't go against christ 's teachings remain as christian doctrine , same as they remained part of jesus ' teaching and speeches when alive . 
  is that a complex concept to grasp ? 
  how much longer do we need to listen to ignorant anti-christians quote leviticus or some other bullshit that jesus ' teaching clearly condemns presented as christiantiy ? 
  yep, 
  fair enough , explains it . 
  could ' v written that when i asked instead of posting irrelevant articles . 
  cause they somehow made a horribly sad event sound cheerful . 
  the song 's name : `` what goes around comes around '', 
  `` i have ever met '' is a good point . 
  i ' v studied history of nationalism as a course during my master 's . 
  this attitude is staple to pretty much every nation , which had to form a state out of a recent struggle ( recent being up to a century ) . 
  it as much prominent in all of them , the norm around the world , rather than the exceoption . 
  the exception are the states that have avoided destruction and serious external threat recently , like sweden . 
  what grandeur ? 
  are n't the poles quite self-hating ? 
  as in every second joke i ; v heard from them is about their own country and people . 
  especially popular `` we are our own 's greatest enemy '' type of humour . 
  they seem to realize their country is shit and be open about it , unlike say russia or the us . 
  they ' v got a grandeur delusion nowhere near what i ' v seen from the poles . 
  ca n't speak of their work ethics , never worked with such you could be right . 
  did n't get the last part about the society . 
  they hate people who choose to form their society ? 
  what ? 
  is n't that a honorary title , like the one mentioned in the article about mary ? 
  basically just a show . 
  how is it a legislative change of the political system ? 
  how is poland to become a christian theocracy , which is what you wrote ? 
  the torah or the new testament ? 
  cause there 's a difference between christianity and judaism you know ? 
  what does jesus prescribe the death penalty for ? 
  petersburg region makes so much more sense to be russia 's centre . 
  a proper strategic place , with great canal opportunities for transportation . 
  or ... chudskoye ozero . 
  is n't deciding to take control of ones borders and society `` taking responsibility '' ? 
  would n't `` trying to associate with ideas of others '' and `` running from responsibility '' be equal to just following whaterver western europe and the eu say/do ? 
  copy them ? 
  is n't the east doing the opposite ? 
  trying to take responsibility for how their societies tunr out by running them with their own ideas , as opposed to what is accepted in the west ? 
  i 'm not trying to dissuade your opinion , just pointing out to a contradiction . 
  good job the yugoslavs did in trasnforming our people and language there into ... well ... this . 
  historically , it 's not large and powerful nations that `` get got '' , it 's small and irrelevant , meaning weak ones . 
  hence why it makes perfect sense for irrelevant states to feel threatened , not the prominent ones . 
  i think polish history proves that and kinda gives them a good reason to feel this way . 
  poland wants to become a christian theocracy ? 
  much more in the long term . 
  before ww2 poland was n't a european power broken down by the war and eventually partitioned . 
  but that 's precisely what happened with the deluge . 
  we can just replace the polish-specific countries with our neighbours . 
  taking half our lands under the dusguise of `` allies '' was pretty sneaky . 
  our knee-jerk reaction to attack them might have been stupid , but it 's the justified response to thieving allies . 
  is armenia in europe though ? 
   located in western asia , [ 19 ] [ 20 ] it is bordered by turkey to the west , georgia to the north , https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenia, 
  i 'd love to take 700,000 romanians if they help us implement the anti-corruption fight they have . 
  we 're entirely controlled by the oligarchy-mafia at the moment . 
  you are right about the referendum part , but this was the situation in 1878 only because 30 years earlier , as a result of the crimean war and the help of the local bulgarians to the russian army , there was a huge exodus of bulgarians who fled north , into bessarabia and moldova . 
  this removed their firm majority , which had been established for well over 1000 years since the bulgarian nation was born in dobrudja , where the state got created , and the bulgarian despotate of karvuna/dobruja was one of the last pieces of our state to fall . 
  hence we consider it like our kosovo - the cradle of our nation and where we dominated for 1200 years , before one mass exodus first made us a minority , and then another exodus in the first world war made us non existent . 
  super .

  true but romania to speak of all - we did n't charge against you , so a proper nice backstab on your part was n't really our provocation . 
  especially having already lost northern dobrudja to you when the russian gave it in exchange for bessarabia . 
  true , i know that i ' v worded it wrongly . 
  bulgaria produced the first bombs but also equipped a plane specifically for bomber purposes for the first time . 
  ( the italians just carried a couple bombs at their feet and threw them ) so bulgaria does have the first bomber in that sense . 
  they joined because they had no idea that this entitled embracing the self-destructive attitudes of multiculturalism , cultural relativism and third wave feminism . 
  now they know better and are chosing what to embrace from western europe and what not to . 
  this is entirely normal and logical .
