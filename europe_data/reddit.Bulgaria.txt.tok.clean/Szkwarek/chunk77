  again - major reform needed for it to do anything , let alone wonders . 
  i am therefore not defending an eu i agree with , i am defending an eu that is far from the burreaucratic , despotic monster recently painted around europe by incompetent national governments in need of a scapegoat . 
  condeming it as fundamentally `` undemocratic '' and portraying as some sort of brussels-based dictatorship of aparatchiks with zero national accountability is equally stupid , when in fact there are so many checks in its systems that make it reliant on national consent and accountable to the governments and thus , people . 
  there was zero that the people i worked for in the council of the eu could do without direct instruction from the respective ministries back in sofia . 
  we received daily `` notes '' and had to send reports on all we did and happened in the council . 
  not one of the `` eurocrats '' i knew and worked with could do jack shit according to his own will , everything was in line with the current ministry , and thus national government , policy . 
  only the mp 's have such freedom , but they are themselves elected on national grounds . 
  so do please enlighten me where should ' v i been looking to see this `` sinister '' brussels eurocratic dictatorship that the nations have zero control over ? 
  other than in the tabloids . 
  of course much more reform is needed , but that does n't mean the eu is n't already so intwined in checks and balances to make it one of the most democratic institutions in the world , light years away from the technocratic dictatorship the tabloids describe it as , mainly because people do n't realize they have little control over their own national governments , whitout whom the eu does n't do shit . 
  what little i ' v read on the commonwealth left me with an impression the vast majority of the population of the grand dutchy after it merged with poland in the 16th century was , indeed , slavic speaking . 
  this including the majority of its nobility . 
  wikipedia says even by the end of the 14th century `` just 10 % to 14 % of which was ethnically lithuanian '' . 
  so why should n't they include a state they were the vast majority of in their history ? 
  unless the above information is untrue , in which case correct me . 
  what i saw working in the council of the eu is that every eu country , no matter how small , could veto a process and hamper the dominance of even huge sates like germany , by say - malta . 
  this popular mantra of the eu as `` undemocratic '' comes from people with little knowledge on the institutional workings of the union , but with lots of populist agenda in their head . 
  you do n't like something brussels does ? 
  contact your nation 's representatives there , voted by yourself and acountable to your national government , and ask them why they did n't veto it or propose an alternative . 
  nothing 's done in brussels without the consent of national governments , but all the blame is shifted to it precisely by those same governments . 
  yes, 
  the us is actually strongly in favour of the uk remaining in the eu . 
  no i 'm just really into wasting time by asking questions i know the answers to . 
  do n't over-dramatize what i wrote . 
  neither did i write the uk is the only thing against federalisation , nor that federalisation itself was the only way to avoid remaining a divided and increasingly sidelined bunch of small countries . 
  but it is a fact that the uk is entertaining the idea of leaving the union , despite its own military warning of the inevitability of it becoming less relevant and capable of power-projection , and it is a fact it quite often is an actor that opposes integration whilst inside the union . 
  what 's wrong with it ? 
  in short , uk becoming less relevant or able to project power in a world of increasing number of second-tier powers . 
  but sure , do leave the eu or stay and hamper integration - brussels is the real threat , not europe losing all of its relevance and position on the international stage precisely * because * it remained a divided continent of states shouting `` muuuh sovereignty '' ... 
  i certainly answered your questions , but i do not blame you from backing down when the facts are stacked against your arguments . 
  as for the tatar thing - it is yet another place you contradict yourself . 
  so many points to raise , i 'll just do the basic ones : `` bulgars were turkic '' , but somehow * bulgarians * are tatars . 
  this seems a bit off when you intentionally use two different words , for two different groups of people . 
  the bulgars created a state vastly populated by hellenised thracians and slavs and assimilated into them , hence the 100 % slavic language of modern day bulgarians , yet somehow these slavs became turkic ? 
  care to say how much of modern bulgarian is turkic ? 
  and if we go beyond linguistics into pseudo-scientific racism - care to show me bulgarians that are mongoloid ? 
  second point , even if modern bulgairans were the exact same as the bulgars and not assimilated slavs , even then what do tatars have to do with this ? 
  tatars are a very specific tribe that joined ghengis khan 's confederation in the 13th century , together with the naimans , merkits , khamag mongols and khereids . 
  they moved with him west , conquered rus and settled around the azov sea . 
  what do they have to do with the bulgarians , who by that time were fully slavic and had even created the slavic alphabet , or with the bulgars , who existed 600 years earlier and were arguably either a turkic tribe from the caucasus , or iranic tribe from afghanistan . 
  both places quite far away from mongolia and about 600 years apart from the appearance of the tatar people . 
  so denying exactly what is idiotic ? 
  that tatars and bulgars are 600 years apart ? 
  or that they lived thousands of kilometres away ? 
  or that bulgarians are the slavic replacement of the bulgars who by the time the tatars showed up were already a centre of slavic culture and alphabet , building their second slavic orthodox empire in the balkans ? 
  i know you most likely wo n't answer these same as the other simple historical facts you could n't , but for your sake i had to write it so you do n't end up sounding ridiculous among a more historically informed crowd than the average bulgar-hating serbs . 
  oh ok then , the current gov is replacing people * even * more so than the previous . 
  still does n't explain how this sub , and western liberal media in general , went from exactly zero mentioning of the internal political machinations in poland during po , to `` literary hitler '' daily alarms of what the new one does * slightly more * than the previous . 
  if say , the new one increased what the previous also did by a factor of 10 , the media increased their alarm of that by a factor of 1000 , so the difference of 990 seems like a political bias against a right-wing , eurosceptical gov. 
   why is that your region ? 
  it was turkish region if we want to be precise . 
  before the turks it was part of the serbian state , skoplje was even our capital . 
  we had the same right as you did to take macedonia . 
  it was inhabited in its vast majority by ethnic bulgarians . 
  a third of our nation was there . 
  a huge portion of our writers , revolutionaries and musicians came from there . 
  out of 5.470 schools in the region , according to ottoman census , 4,870 were bulgarian . 
  this was inside ottoman state , so the schools organised according to what the local people wanted , not imposed by a bulgarian state , and they chose to do it overwhelmingly as bulgarian curriculum . 
  when the ottomans allowed voting on which church to dominate its balkan regions , macedonia voted for bulgarian and became part of the bulgarian excharhate - again voluntarily before bulgaria even existed . 
  all european ethnograpgers and scholars and all ottoman census data of the time shows the region as massively bulgarian : [ french ] ( https://jaddeyekabir.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/balkans-ethnic_1861.jpg ) [ english ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/ernst-ravenstein-balkans-ethnic-map-1880.jpg ) [ german ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/bulgarians_in_1912.jpg ) [ austrian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/ethnic_map_of_balkans_-_german_1882.jpg ) [ russian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bf/ethnic_map_of_balkans_-_russian_1867.jpg ) [ german consul in adrianople , using ottoman census ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/ethnographic_map_of_european_turkey_from_1877_by_carl_sax.jpg ) [ american ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/distribution_of_races_on_the_balkans_in_1922_hammond.png ) [ belgian ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_765kg51rvbe/s9njkekv9ci/aaaaaaaaaig/h83pev-1tt4/s1600/dr_map_24.jpg ) [ german again ] ( http://kroraina.com/makedonija/karti/ethno/volkerkartevonmittel-undsudosteuropa.jpg ) [ swiss german ] ( https://www2.bc.edu/~heineman/maps/ethnic.jpg )  if you are talking about this do i have to remind that serbia in war with turkey at same time ? 
  how do you expect help ? 
  it 's absolutely ridiculous ... 
  i admit this would explain it , i ' v read extensively of the war just did n't associate the years correlated with our uprising . 
  i was wrong here . 
   this is just silly . 
  what anti-bulgarian propaganda ? 
  in this context i meant the serbs often calling bulgarians backstabbers because your nation collective memmory wiped out the fact you backstabbed us first . 
  overall however , you have to be joking that there 's no anti-bulgarian propaganda from the time of tito . 
  the myth of bulgarians as `` tatars '' i see constantly serbs write on the net . 
  the myth we just backstab you out of nowhere , for no reason and with no such examples from your side . 
  the myth we are n't slavs , despite our language being completely slavic . 
  ( presumably because you also put a sort of racial conotation to slavs due to russian panslavism being strong there , and combine this with the myth of bulgarians being `` tatars '' - a group of people that did n't appear until 600 years after bulgaria was established ) . 
   we clearly did n't learn the same history because if i recall it was russia who agitated the most for treaty of san stefano from which bulgaria had by far the biggest territorial expansions . 
  russians being against bulgaria in 1878 ... really interesting point of view . 
  you literary quoted me saying before 1878 , yet use 1878 as a reference . 
  before the war of 1878 russia was acting against the bulgarians when meddling in ottoman affairs , favouring the greek church dominance . 
  then they tried establishing a large puppet of theirs in the balkans with san stefano , but when the stipulations in the treaty allowing them full control of bulgaria almost as a `` gubernya '' through a `` special consul '' was rejected by the great powers , they quickly supported dismantling bulgaria to as small as possible , with eastern rumelya even remaining ottoman protectorate . 
  that 's why they opposed the unification 7 years later and supported the serbs by removing their entire officer corps that was training our army , including their artillery pieces . 
  after the serb defeat they demanded bulgaria get no reparations and no land from the serbs , despite punishing bulgaria 's aggression of 1913 with exactly this . 
   what ? 
  i wrote `` afterwards yes , you became german puppet , then russian again , then german again '' . 
  nothing about time period when you turned your back to russia and turned towards geramny , that 's just you spinning my words . 
  no , you wrote that most of the 19th century bulgaria was russian puppet , and i explained you that was n't the case . 
  only 7 years , between 1878 and 1885 did bulgaria and russia at all have good relations , before that the russians were acting in favour of the greeks and after that we were with the germans . 
  thus how did you claim bulgaria was during most of the 19th century a russian puppet if there were barely 7 years of any positive relations at all , with the rest being openly hostile between us and them ? 
   i do understand there could not be an alliance between two such different countries ( in terms of size ) . 
  you obviously do n't . 
  of course there could be , if the big one is either too far away to impose direct control or has no interrest in doing so . 
  an alliance is possible , but only if the larger one has an interest/willingness to keep such , rather than attempt imposing direct influence . 
  germany had neither interrest nor possibility at the time to impose direct rule on bulgaria , so it remained as merely and ally that could , and did , reject often germany 's demands . 
  this would ' v changed if they won , but tehy did n't . 
  po did n't use crosses when they stacked all important positions with their own people and fired those related to pis , so what 's the correlation ? 
  ahh , to make it sound edgy , i get it now . 
  because the articles you read it from make it sound like that . 
  the previous government did the exact same you read in the article here , but was praised on r/europe and in general for being so pro-eu and liberal . 
  perspectives matter . 
  that 's a very smart move policy-wise that i had n't though of before . 
  makes sense though . 
  you call bulgarians backstabbers because of ww1 and ww2 , when we tried to take back our region you occupied in 1912 . 
  but it still makes no sense , since only a friend can backstab/betray you .
