  how 's that hypocritical ? 
  the difference being when eastern europe is invaded by russians they want them just out , back to russia , where they came from , not `` redirected '' towards italy . 
  when southern europe is invaded by african and asian migrants their soultion is n't the same - to send them back where they came from , but to relocate them to the rest of europe . 
  two fundamentally different situations . 
  eastern europe would love to help you out with keeping your borders secure and sending all violators back . 
  in return asking to help do the same with our eastern border .

  nor could you defend against , say , a us aggression . 
  would that make one such justifiable ? 
  i was not talking at any point which decision is most likely or which outcome closest to achievement . 
  i was talking what is right . 
  a region wants to be part of country x , then it should be . 
  who is country y to claim otherwise ? 
  best outcome is for azerbajan to accept it has no right over a region that is inhabited with armenians and end this conflict . 
  it is very realistic when talking about regions adjecent to the country the majority of their population is from . 
  a land with an armenian majority can be nothing but armenia 's . 
  same with all nations . 
  `` christians '' . 
  the ones who do that are entirely concentrated in the most radical of protestant sects , who take the old testament even more as their doctrine than the new . 
  ( westborough baptists for example base all of their hate on quotes from the torah , completely disregarding the new ) as such they are excluded from the nicean creed and thus not christians - more close to judaism in ther views than christianity . 
  because you need them for context . 
  when christ talks of some law from the torah he wants to denounce and give a new message you need to know what this law is . 
  you need to know about the torah . 
  when previous prophets are mentioned you need to know about them . 
  when the stories of moses are mentioned you got ta know who he is to understand . 
  the old testament provides a context for the new , inside which the doctrines of the christian religion are , but it does n't provide the doctrines itself . 
  christianity is the ideology of jesus christ 's messages ( duuuh ) , which you can find in the new testament . 
  modern anti-theists have embraced one flawed argument against christianity and regurgitate it to no end , despite it being utterly invalid . 
  quoting the old testament as `` the christian bible '' . 
  the very reason christianity and judaism are separate religions is the fact a guy called jesus came up and started denouncing many of the parts and messages of the torah and give his own interpretation of god and how people should live ( `` so now i am giving you a new commandment : love each other . 
  just as i have loved you , you should love each other . '', 
  john 13:34 ) , partly for which he was executed ( other than claiming to be the king of israel and the messiah ) . 
  the torah is part of the christian bible as `` the old testament '' , but its messages are not the theological doctrines of christianity , as they are often directly denounced in the new testament - the actual source of doctrine for the religion . 
  ( for example directly denouncing the revenge messages of the torah `` ye have heard that it hath been said , an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth : but i say unto you , that ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also . 
  `` matthew 5:38 ) this experiment does what i ' v seen often - taking quotes from the old testament , which are clearly rejected in the new ( like killing adulterers , despite christ himself stopping this when they are about to stone marie magdalene with the words `` let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her . 
  `` john 8:7 ) , but presenting them as the messages of `` the christian bible '' . 
  sorry , but nothing which is in deuteronomy or especially leviticus is part of christianity . 
  the very core of christian theology , the messages of non-violence of christ , reject almost everything in those parts of the old testament . 
  by quoting these texts the above experiment is basically quoting judaism , and only hard-line orthodox judaism , yet presenting it as christianity . 
  it 's particurarly ironic , considering anti-theist today often parade themselves as `` logic , reason and knowledge-driven '' , or as `` knowing more about religion than the actual religious people '' . 
  then go on to present the ideas that christ was killed for denouncing as `` christian '' . 
  this ca n't be healthy . 
  why ca n't the azerbaijanis leave a region that is 95 % armenian alone ? 
  i love the romantic/commonwealth tone of the belarussians from [ zenon ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhwbux7sgbs ) and [ \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u044b \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0430 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drbbho2sgxe ) . 
  depends if those people are the actual natives of the land , which was stolen from them , or themselves later migrants . 
  you ca n't tell people how to assimilate in their own stolen land , but you can demand full assimilation from groups that came to * your * land and refuse to integrate . 
  why wasted ? 
  is n't poland showing some of the best economic results in europe , better than even germany in terms of growth ? 
  ah well then i take it back , pardon me !, 
  except your country is like 150 times the size of ours . 
  the women ... jesus christ the women ...

  ahh , here 's why . 
  figures . 
  should it be ? 
  that 's not funny anymore . 
  clearly you ' v misunderstood my entire point . 
  it was n't that education should be based on each and every heritage that can be found among the demographic . 
  it 's that it should be based on the specific heritage of that said country . 
  ireland was dominated for a few thousand years by celtic paganism and then for 1500 years by catholicism . 
  that 's its clear heritage when religion goes , and so it should be thought same as history is , for people to learn about and understand their ancestors . 
  islam and judaism are n't such a connection into ireland 's history or their ancestors . 
  of course it 's the historical perspective i am talking about , that 's where heritage comes from , is n't it ? 
  not from today and how many muslims or hindus live there atm . 
  in countries where islam and judaism are as fundamental part of the heritage and history of that country , sure !, 
  yes . 
  i did not claim one is `` ture identity '' and the other is n't . 
  i claimed afundamental difference between one formed in a colonial state of 200 years on the basis of recent migrants , and others formed after 1000 years with much different history and circumstance . 
  pointing fundamental differences is n't eligable for the no true scotsman fallacy . 
  yes , that actually sounds great . 
  heritage is heritage and should be learned , catholic , pagan , regarldess . 
  that 's my point . 
  i 'm not advocating a positive rendition of catholicism , but a mere explanation of its core ideas , considering they were dominating the cultural and social fabric of your society for more than a millennium . 
  the american identity and that of any old world nation are completely different in the very basics . 
  europeans are n't from 200 year old colonial nations of immigrants , assimilation and identity work very different . 
  why is the history of x particular country thought at school more than of all others ? 
  and why ca n't they learn history from their parents or at sunday school ? 
  because it 's part of their heritage that the state should teach them about , and so is catholicism , regardless how much atheists today want to pretend it never happened . 
  you teach kids about their other heritage - historical , musical , cultural etc. 
  at history or music classes . 
  religion is as fundamental to the heritage and past of each european nation yet it should n't be taught ? 
  they should learn what christianity is from dank euphoric memes , stand up comedians and tv shows ridiculing it , right ? 
  atheists downvoting you for defending religious heritage . 
  leftists downvoting you for making an anti-immigrationist comment . 
  this sub is no place for christians . 
  you do n't seem to know what assimilation means . 
  when it 's successful , one rarely even knows what the country of his ancestors is , and certainly does n't root for it . 
  because he is assimilated - he considers himself member of the nation he lives in and no other . 
  he has no split identity , he has no elements of another culture . 
  that 's nowhere near the case in geramny where these people are fully loyal to their ancestor 's identity and believe themselves not the same people as the germans , but merely sharing the same country . 
  that 's a parallel identity . 
  i had intercourse with her . 
  and not because of liberals insisting immigrants should not be assimilated , but instead their culture protected and accomodated , so that even future generations keep those identities instead of fully embracing the local one ? 
  you sure it 's not [ strong ] ( https://barenakedislam.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/meanwhile-in-germany.jpg?w=640 ) ?
