  it 's not `` balkan mentality '' thus - it 's the idea of ethnic-based nations over civic/geographic/state-based ones . 
  the only large national minority here are the turks , who would lose a lot if they left the state since their party ( dps ) is the epitome of oligarchy and corruption , controlling most economic power in the country through former communists privatising in the 90s and recent energy deals with russia , and using that to put the minority in a very favorable and disproportionately important position , which they 'd lose if they secceeded . 
  sure , the ideology you do n't follow ( or understand ) is `` random crap '' , but i 'm sure the ones you do , be it political , cultural or societal ones `` totally make sense '' , and you 'd be appalled if someone advocated their removal . 
  the militant modern atheist is the quintessential 21st century arrogant bigot . 
  and this is a problem how ? 
  it goes against the positive image serbs have of mother russia ? 
  can serbs be any more of kremlin bootlickers ? 
  but it did give the serbs a taste of their own medicine , so that 's good enough . 
  true , but not the best person to condemn anyone . 
  what he and bush did is directly linked to the shitstorm today . 
  why claim i try to `` purify '' bandera when i clearly branded him a murderer of thousands ? 
  all i pointed out is that the people who worship murderers of millions have zero right to condemn people for worshiping murderers of thousands . 
  remove all worship of the ussr and its leaders in russia and then you have the right to wave a finger at who ukraine praises . 
  the kremlin , red square parades and various rallies are filled with the bolshevik red star , hammer and sickle and portraits of lenin , even sometimes stalin . 
  by comparisson to whom bandera is like an angel . 
  so the russians dare judge the ukrainians for a few portraits of a murderer of thousands , whilst they openly worship murderers of millions . 
  your society 's hypocrisy never ends . 
  what ? 
  can you be any more vague/wannabe-edgy ? 
  edit : just now saw your profile name , all makes sense now . 
  it was 150 b-24 liberator bombers escorted by 50 p-38 lightning fighters , engaged by 36 bulgarian messerschmitt \u041c\u0435-109g-2 . 
  yes , the english article is very short compared to the bulgarian one , but basically he engaged the formation of 150 bombers for some time until he ran out of ammo and the machine was severely damaged by the fire of their on board machine guns . 
  his engines were about to go out , so the fighter plane was gone anyway . 
  his choice was to catapult or use the machine itself to take out a bomber . 
  and did the second , aiming the plane till the very end without catapulting . 
  [ dimitar spisarevski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimitar_spisarevski ) was a pilot during ww2 , who rammed his airplane into an american bomber bound for sofia , sacraficing his life to save people in the capital . 
  well known among nationalists and historians , but largely unknown to the general public . 
  edit : people massively downvoting this can at least comment why they do it , as i could n't fathom why would you do it to a post with no political or controversial content whatsoever , but merely mentioning a ww2 hero . 
  you are correct , i ought to have used `` intervening '' or `` meddling '' in a sovereign state 's internal affairs . 
  but i believe you got my point regardless of the semantics . 
  i know of a way to limit romania 's geographic challange and make itself more easily defendable - just give us back dobrudja and you 'll get a lovely easily defendable border along the entire northern bank of danube . 
  it 's about how people are raised . 
  it used to be by the family , with the values of family . 
  now it 's by the media , entertainment , tv shows and commercials , with the values of career at all cost , material wealth , social success and all such things that make family simply a burden . 
  having a kid used to be a goal for people in life , now it 's having a great car and annual trip to a warm tropical beach . 
  why ? 
  it 's still : a. 
  intervention in a sovereign state 's internal affairs . 
  hypocritical and disgusting to demand people worship your occupation force . 
  damn i missed it . 
  :( do another one after the first episode . 
  no , this is r/europe not r/worldnews and is meant for anything related to europe , including culture , media and projects like these . 
  if anything , there 's been too much preocupation with news here lately and very little of the other stuff , so stfu . 
  and that 's bloody prague . 
  imagine me seeing tons of them here in sofia . 
  puts into perspective the crisis there . 
  the occupied poland in a month and a half after half the country was taken by the soviets and thus the entire defence plan to stand on the vistula bank failed . 
  otherwise would take even more . 
  on the west it also took more than a week and only because hitler could throw his entire army in the ardennes offensive that surrounded the alliies in belgium . 
  he could n't have done that with his army stuck in poland . 
  you are severely overestimating the wehrmacht of 1939 . 
  as for the ussr , i do not see how it is strange the poles did n't want to ally themselves with a state that had invaded them just 18 years prior and barely stopped from occupation . 
  a state already known as a brutal totalitarian regime that destroys the very fabric of a modern society and kills millions . 
  it was more than natural to perceive the ussr as as much a threat as hitler at the very least . 
  the guarantees they gave poland is what pinned him down . 
  the wehrmacht of 1939 was n't capable of simultaniously fighting in poland and on the west . 
  hitler of 1939 was nowhere near the power required to threaten and destroy the ussr as that 2 years later . 
  he was pinned from both sides and absolutely dreaded the idea of fighting on two fronts . 
  even without the officer corps ussr 's armies were stronger at the time than the wehmacht and with vastly larger resources . 
  the only reason barbarossa could happen was stalin 's aid to hitler in quickly splitting eastern europe with him , so that he could turn towards the west before they take any effective action , and even aid him massively with shipments of resources whilst he is conquering the west . 
  how is tha `` postponing '' the war ? 
  and why postpone it , if it only makes hitler exponentially stronger between 1939 and 1941 ? 
  stalin simply helped the invastion of the ussr happen and be as devastating as it was because he was greedy enough to split eastern europe with hitler . 
  had he guaranteed poland instead hitler would n't even dare attack it in the first place , and remain isolated and pinned from two sides with no actual threat to europe . 
  molotov-ribbentropp opened hitler 's door to europe , and eventually - russia . 
  serbs cry like babies about the horrible occupation of the turks or nazis and their attrocities , but are happy and cheeful whenever russia 's occupations and attrocities over other nations are mentioned . 
  pathetic kremlin bootlickers . 
  but the revival process was n't in the 90s , it was in the late 80s and turkey simply could n't intervene as in cyprus , because the cold war was still on and bulgaria was part of the warsaw pact and the ussr 's sphere of influence . 
  invading bulgaria was equal to triggering a third world war or at least some form of major international conflict , which invading cyprus was n't . 
  also , there was n't any form of democratization in bulgaria during the revival process , the regime expressed fierce totalitarianism in its last years . 
  furthermore , the revival process was merely chaning turks ' names , and once it failed , the opening of the turkish border to those them who chose to leave . 
  nothing more - no violence or deportations . 
  thus cyprus , where actual ethnic cleansing and deportations occurred is quite a different example . 
  i hope you have n't submitted it yet cause if the person reading it is versed in balkan history he might penalize you for the above . 
  i think i lost the thread 2 comments back . 
  no idea what you mean by positive and negative cases for putin like scenario , or what eu country lies in asia . 
  ( none , so i presume you mean somthing else by it ) sorry , not sure if you ' r too vague or i 'm too distracted today . 
  what 's the positive case ? 
  and nato i suppose . 
  it 's just that `` neo-ottomanism '' as akp 's foreign policy often described brings back real bad memmories here . 
  i believe those mean `` third world '' socially . 
  qatar and saudi arabia are hugely wealthy yet `` third world '' culturally , and that 's what some people fear of becoming to sweden as the percentage of muslims increases exponentially without complete assimilation catching up fast enough . 
  which is why their recently growing friendship kinda made me nerveus as someone in bulgaria - a country periodically fucked up by either turkey or russia , with a large turkish minority contrated near the turkish border . 
  the ukraine scenario is like a nightmare to dream of if erdogan becomes a new putin . 
  as a polak i completely agree . 
  i attribute it to poland being the largest of eastern nations and most fiercely anti-russian , so it somewhat rallies a lot of easterners here on its side . 
  which is great , just tone down the poland stronk rethoric . 
  so what if it 's just a common army , not navy ? 
  peace in europe  germany making money not appeasing a neo-fascist state  cheap gas for germany stopping russian aggression  good relations with moscow for germany no one gives a fuck about your selfish interests and desires to appease an aggresive moscow in return for profit . 
  it 's not 1939 . 
  not `` stereotypes '' - that 's something common among many different peoples , but rather germanic superiority preception . 
  manners : ** german/english ** : openhearted/handsome ** italian/polish/hungarian ** : treacherous/boorish/disloyal character : ** german/english ** very good , quite good/charming ** italian/polish/hungarian ** : jealous/more cruel/most cruel war virtues : ** german/english ** - invincible/heroic at sea ** frenchmen/turk ** - cunning / lazy comparison with animal : ** german ** - lion ** russian ** - donkey i mean , it goes on like that ...

  absolutely . 
  3rd time 's the charm . 
  get kumanovo and bloody whole of skopje if you wish , we do n't want that bronze-baroque circus , but you ' r not touching the capital of bulgarian tzar samuil . 
  how 's that anything to do with rule of law in russia ? 
  you ' r describing wars outside the homeland . 
  i am not . 
  see the difference and come back .
