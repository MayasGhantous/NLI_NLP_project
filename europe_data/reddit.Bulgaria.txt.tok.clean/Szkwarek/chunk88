  you ' r the one playing `` what ifs '' with `` the war would have played out completely differently '' . 
  the defence of moscow would be the same if it happened before winter came , as long as the syberian divisions were there . 
  they stopped the germans , not the winter . 
  you can now answer this with a 5th post in a row that says `` winter helped '' or actually get this conversation going somwhere , cause it 's getting tedious to just tell you it was the syberian divisions that stopped the germans and you ignoring that with `` but the winter helped ... '' . 
  you ' r stubbornly denying to either admit you ' r wrong or address the point here - the syberian divisions , and that gets the conversation stuck . 
  you are because you are merely describing the negative effects of winter on its own , without the context , which is that the wehrmacht was only immobile during the 2 weeks of autumn rains , but as the ground hardened it was making rapid progress towards moscow again . 
  the winter alone would n't stop it from taking the city if the siberian divisions had n't arrived in the last moment . 
  meaning it was their arrival the wehrmacht was effectively racing against , not the winter 's , since the divisions stopped it , whilst the winter merely slowed them . 
  we ' r not arguing if winter had a negative effect on the wehrmacht , that 's a given , but rather what stopped them from taking moscow . 
  which was the divisions from the far east , not the wheather . 
  because modern warfare does n't kill anywhere near enough people to actually make a difference . 
  in a world of 7 billion , it would take the death of at least tens of millions of have an impact on the environment . 
  warfare itself , however , consumes a lot of resources , pollutes , and diverts investment from development that could take countries closer to sustainability . 
  it destroys infrastructure and consumes raw materials only to create a greater need for raw materials and resources later on at reconstruction . 
  how much oil is wasted to rebuild a city after it was blown to bits ? 
  how much metal and stone excavated ? 
  war is essentially a huge waste of resources and that increases the environmental pressure thousands of times more than the deaths of a few thousand relieves it . 
  the regular soviet soldiers ( not syberian divisions ) had equally no preparation or equipment for the winter as the soviet supply system had all but collapsed . 
  the tens of thousands frozen in the moscow counteroffensive shows that . 
  do n't divert into straws , the original argument still stands - the arrival of the syberian divisions stopped the wehrmacht from taking moscow , not the winter . 
  no , decisions that lead to the syberian divisions of 800,000 to arrive in time to defend moscow - the key transport hub that connected all railways of european russia , political , demographic and economic centre . 
  winter or not winter they would ' v defended it , so the rush was for the germans to get to moscow before the divisions did , not before winter did . 
  sure winter had a negative impact , but it was equal to both sides - the russians suffered huge casualties due to the temperatures during their january counter-offensive . 
  volleyball . 
  and he was right . 
  they had all the chance of taking the leningrad-moscow-astrakhan line that would effectively render the ussr dead . 
  they failed not because of winter , but because of strategic decisions in the middle of the summer . 
  the two panzer groups of army group centre were capable of taking moscow in late july , but did n't due to the kiev pocket . 
  it was n't 1812 in any way shape or form . 
  isis gives russia the perfect opportunity to get the west off of its back over what it did and does in ukraine . 
  `` cmon guys , forget about it already , we ' v a new common enemy now '' . 
  if the west falls for this and waves the sanctions or abandons ukraine it will be a clear message to the kremlin that their strategy works and they can get away with expansion this way . 
  same as after the georgian war , which made them bold enough to go for ukraine . 
  you let ukraine slide and they 'll go for something else next . 
  also , minimalizing and trivializing words like queen into `` queenie '' '' * does not a point make * '' either . 
  why not just stay in burgas as it is ? 
  we need tourism money too , do n't go give them to kebab ... :(, 
  took me a while to figure out it was sideways . 
  i imagine structure of urbanisation plays more of a role than population density . 
  wallachia has the same population as bulgaria , yet it 's extremely densely red here , because its low urbanisation rate means thousands of large villages and small towns of a few thousand people , whereas in bulgaria half the entire population is concentrated in just 4 red dots - sofia , plovdiv , varna and burgas , with a few dozen large towns of tens of thousands people hold the rest of the population . 
  same with serba , which has almost the exact population and territory as bulgaria , yet is more white here , and greece , which has the same population density as romania , yet is far white here due to concentration of people in athens and thessaloniki . 
  default naming choices for selected countries : `` charles de gaulle '' , `` ataturk '' , `` kenedy '' . 
  can bulgaria pls ? 
  taxes are n't `` socialism '' . 
  the public ownership of the means of production is . 
  impose quotas on immigrants to the eu with a categorization system . 
  people from islamic societies at the bottom of the list , with close to no chance of being allowed to migrate to europe , lest they are highly valued and proven experts in some fields . 
  then return to the idea of state assimilation , which built nations like the french in the first place , making it an aim of the state to uproot completely and thoroughly any foreign culture ( including foreign religion ) from children born in the country . 
  rather than cherishing the growth of parallel communities and foreign exclaves as some misguided , artificial `` diversity '' , europe should cherish nation-building through assimilation and the reinforcement of certain non-negotiable traits of the nation . 
  islam being part of those traits in no european countries other than a few balkan ones , and thus considered incompatible with a full belonging to any of the other nations . 
  `` hey this right here is threatening to burn our house , but do n't look at it !, 
  look at this over there which is threatening to too . '', 
  how is the presence of right-wing extremists in any way negating the fact we are also growing islamist extremists by the thousands in europe ? 
  or how is it even relevant to this thread ? 
  i do not quite follow which is not an intellectual reaction but based on fear - the distates and dissagreement people have with the cultural traits and ideological messages of islam . 
  or the perception muslims will indefinitely continue increasing as a percentage in society due to immigration and high fertility rates , versus european negative rates . 
  which one do you disagree with ? 
  do you consider islam and cultural traits of the societies that are marked by it acceptable and in no way contradictory to european ones . 
  or do you disagree the percentage of muslims will continue to increase if left unchecked ? 
  or both ? 
  it 's radical to not want large waves of migrants from a particular , alien religion and cultural background in your state ? 
  i ' v always wondered - would people like you , the educated and progressive turks presumably from the western part of the country rather have that state split , with a large chunk of the backwards east going to a kurdistan , so that your more enlightened type in the west become a more substantial percentage of the population and exhibit a greater force in the modernisation of the country ?

  please be so kind to give them a hand by sharing their project or kickstarter campaign on your facebook page so they can make this thing happen . 
  it is n't paranoia if every extensive research ever done shows the new generations of muslims largely either preserving their parents ' islamic values or getting even more trenched into them . 
  it is rather you , who focus on the little exceptions to say to yourself `` it 's all going to be allright , no need to worry '' that are acting like us republican climate change deniers , who will accept no ammount of big-picture research and instead just focus on the small exceptions to prove there is `` nothing to worry about '' in the long term : `` overwhelming percentages of muslims in many countries want islamic law ( sharia ) to be the official law of the land , according to a worldwide survey by the pew research center .
