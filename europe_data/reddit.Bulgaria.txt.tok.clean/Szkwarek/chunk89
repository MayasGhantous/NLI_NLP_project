  ( including 93 % in indonesia and 65 % in turkey ) .

  http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/topics/religious_affiliation/muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf \u2022 pew research ( 2013 ) : 81 % of south asian muslims and 57 % of north africans support amputating limbs for theft . 
  http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/topics/religious_affiliation/muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf furthermore : the religion of islam itself is corrupt . 
  the very core scriptures ( quran + six sunni hadiths ) contain : death for apostasy : \u2022 qur ` an ( 4:89 ) - `` they wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve , and then you would be equal ; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them , until they emigrate in the way of god ; then , if they turn their backs , take them , and slay them wherever you find them ; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper . '', 
  \u2022 bukhari ( 52:260 ) - '' ... the prophet said , ` if somebody ( a muslim ) discards his religion , kill him . ', 
  '' death for homosexuality \u2022 qur ` an ( 7:80 -84 ) - '' ... for ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women : ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds ... and we rained down on them a shower ( of brimstone ) '' death by stoning for sex outside marriage ( if you are or ever were married ) \u2022 bukhari ( 6:60:79 ) - muhammad orders two people guilty of `` illegal '' intercourse stoned to death . 
  death to anyone who insults muhammad in any country , whether or not he was ever muslim . 
  \u2022 qur ` an ( 33:61 ) - `` accursed , they will be seized wherever found and slain with a ( fierce ) slaughter . '', 
  \u2022 bukhari ( 59:369 ) - this recounts the murder of ka ' b bin al-ashraf , a jewish poet who wrote verses about muslims that muhammad found insulting . 
  he asked his followers , ` who will rid me of this man ? ', 
  and several volunteered . 
  al-ashraf was stabbed to death while fighting for his life . 
  male and female genital mutilation . 
  the `` right '' of a husband to beat his wife . 
  \u2022 qur ` an ( 4:34 ) - `` men are the maintainers of women because allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property ; the good women are therefore obedient , guarding the unseen as allah has guarded ; and ( as to ) those on whose part you fear desertion , admonish them , and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them ; then if they obey you , do not seek a way against them ; surely allah is high , great . '', 
  the `` right '' of a husband to have sex with his wife whenever . 
  \u2022 qur ` an ( 2:223 ) - `` your wives are as a tilth unto you ; so approach your tilth when or how ye will . '', 
  a completely sexist divorce law where men can instantly divorce and women can barely do it at all . 
  \u2022 muslim ( 9:3493 ) - muhammad practices the triple talaq and approved of his followers doing the same . 
  degrading women and threatening them as only 50 % of a man . 
  \u2022 qur ` an ( 4:11 ) - ( inheritance ) `` the male shall have the equal of the portion of two females '' \u2022 qur ` an ( 2:282 ) - ( court testimony ) `` and call to witness , from among your men , two witnesses . 
  and if two men be not found then a man and two women . '', 
  and so on ... this is not an extremist interpretation of islam , this is what every `` educated '' ( in islamic texts ) sunni muslim will believe , because it 's the commandments that muhammad wrote in the qur ` an/hadith . 
  the land belongs to the one who lives on it , so it stops being an occupation when the majority people in a region either get the independence they crave , or stop craving for independence . 
  the kurds wo n't be occupied when the turkish state either makes them wish to be part of turkey and have zero desire for independence , or when it lets them go . 
  there 's no such thing as `` x ammount of years make this land mine '' , or else anatolia would be by right greek and armenian , not turkish . 
   just another bulgarian trying to live on the handouts of others . 
  it really does n't help your position of the liberal defending democracy against racists and bigots , when you finish your entire rant with a pure racist/bigot statement about `` just another bulgarian trying to live on the handouts of others '' . 
  it 's actually almost comical . 
  like someone raging against , say , social prejudice and then ending with `` just another lower class pleb '' . 
  the fact you are oblivious to the contradiction between your position and your statement give a hint to your coginitive and intellectual capacity . 
  what makes it even funnier is that i 'm not actually bulgarian ... 
  and exactly why should n't the syrian kurs link up with the other kurds surrounded to the west ? 
  what 's it up to turkey to decide on the kurds of syria ? 
  not enough it occupies the majority of their land , it now will decide on that land that lies outside of its borders too ? 
  focusing on the ones that assimilate and ignoring the vast majority that do n't is being an ostrich with his head in the sand . 
  no available statistical analysis on the attitudes of muslims born in europe supports you theory . 
  if they reach 8 % of your population , constitute 1.9 billion people around the world and at the very essence of being a bulgarian lies a medieval proto-fascist ideology - then yes , you are more than wellcome to sound the alarm . 
  calling people insane is n't arguing , it 's the admittance you lack other arguments . 
  that would be a completely valid position if bulgarians were indeed growing exponentially as percentage in europe . 
  and calling my desire europe not to have a large islamic component fear negates it how ? 
  so the answer is you would ignore a growing percentage of people in your country being muslim , no matter how much they grow ? 
  and for the sake of the ideal of religious freedom you do n't care if there will be major consequences to such a demographic change , even if they are actually changes concerning religious and other freedoms themselves ? 
  which nato countries support pkk for this to be an analogy with turkey supporting isis ? 
  turkey is n't just not helping the kurds fighting isis - it 's bombing them and davtoglu openly warning them not to attack isis on the corridor it has to turkey . 
  you seem not to know the difference between pkk and ypg . 
  i never wrote a thing about pkk . 
  i never claimed `` the turks did this '' about paris . 
  whereas about turkey supporting isis , i am not sure if you deny that or are trying to divert the discussion . 
  if turkey 's interests are aligned with those of an organization like isis , then yes - fuck turkey very much . 
  just because turkey ended up with a large kurdish population it does n't want to give autonomy to , and is therefore now aligning with the world 's biggest scum to keep kurds in neighbouring syria from autonomy too , does n't mean anyone should give a fuck about turkey 's interests . 
  those are bad , selfish goals of keeping not only your kurds , but the one in neighbouring countries from having a state , at the price of helping people who destroy ancient relics , behead children and burn people alive . 
  it should make turks sick , not angry at the people who fight those barbarians . 
  and what if you just do n't want islam and muslim communities to grow in percentage in europe ? 
  just like that - not out of fear for terrorism , not out of a desire to polarize - simply because you do n't agree with the core values of islam or believe larger muslim communities would have a positive effect on the continent ? 
  what then ? 
  still allow their numbers to rise for fear of `` polarizing '' them otherwise ? 
  just suck it up and accept a future where islamic communities are a fundamental , infuential and large part of this continent ? 
  turkey is also actively aiding isis , not only in trade and supply , but to the point of bombing ypg and openly warning it not to close the corridor isis has towards turkey by linking with kobane . 
  as isis has now openly declared war on a nato member , i believe the alliance must take actions against its member state ( turkey ) supporting a faction that is at war with other member states , and thus respectively the whole alliance . 
  i also like pew research . 
  and they seem to agree with the concerns of the people in europe whom you describe as `` extremists '' against islam 's growth , that the attitudes of vast percentages of the muslims are highly dangerous and very opposed to all of europe 's values . 
  `` overwhelming percentages of muslims in many countries want islamic law ( sharia ) to be the official law of the land , according to a worldwide survey by the pew research center . '', 
  http://www.pewforum.org/2013/04/30/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-overview/ furthermore : while only a very small fraction of muslims actually go on to commit terrorist acts , a significant percentage of the muslim population have favourable attitudes towards terrorism , violence in defence of islam , sharia , and oppression of women , homosexuals , and basic human rights . 
  even the `` moderate '' muslims are still vastly socially backwards compared everyone else in a secular , liberal democracy . 
  \u2022 icm poll : 40 % of muslims want sharia law in uk http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510866/poll-reveals-40pc-of-muslims-want-sharia-law-in-uk.html \u2022 macdonald laurier institute : 35 % of canadian muslims would not repudiate al-qaeda .
