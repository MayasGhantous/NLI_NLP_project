  http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/topics/religious_affiliation/muslim/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- furthermore : the religion of islam itself is corrupt . 
  the very core scriptures ( quran + six sunni hadiths ) contain : death for apostasy : \u2022 qur ` an ( 4:89 ) - `` they wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve , and then you would be equal ; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them , until they emigrate in the way of god ; then , if they turn their backs , take them , and slay them wherever you find them ; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper . '', 
  \u2022 bukhari ( 52:260 ) - '' ... the prophet said , ` if somebody ( a muslim ) discards his religion , kill him . ', 
  '' death for homosexuality \u2022 qur ` an ( 7:80 -84 ) - '' ... for ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women : ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds ... and we rained down on them a shower ( of brimstone ) '' death by stoning for sex outside marriage ( if you are or ever were married ) \u2022 bukhari ( 6:60:79 ) - muhammad orders two people guilty of `` illegal '' intercourse stoned to death . 
  death to anyone who insults muhammad in any country , whether or not he was ever muslim . 
  \u2022 qur ` an ( 33:61 ) - `` accursed , they will be seized wherever found and slain with a ( fierce ) slaughter . '', 
  \u2022 bukhari ( 59:369 ) - this recounts the murder of ka ' b bin al-ashraf , a jewish poet who wrote verses about muslims that muhammad found insulting . 
  he asked his followers , ` who will rid me of this man ? ', 
  and several volunteered . 
  al-ashraf was stabbed to death while fighting for his life . 
  male and female genital mutilation . 
  the `` right '' of a husband to beat his wife . 
  \u2022 qur ` an ( 4:34 ) - `` men are the maintainers of women because allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property ; the good women are therefore obedient , guarding the unseen as allah has guarded ; and ( as to ) those on whose part you fear desertion , admonish them , and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them ; then if they obey you , do not seek a way against them ; surely allah is high , great . '', 
  the `` right '' of a husband to have sex with his wife whenever . 
  \u2022 qur ` an ( 2:223 ) - `` your wives are as a tilth unto you ; so approach your tilth when or how ye will . '', 
  a completely sexist divorce law where men can instantly divorce and women can barely do it at all . 
  \u2022 muslim ( 9:3493 ) - muhammad practices the triple talaq and approved of his followers doing the same . 
  degrading women and threatening them as only 50 % of a man . 
  \u2022 qur ` an ( 4:11 ) - ( inheritance ) `` the male shall have the equal of the portion of two females '' \u2022 qur ` an ( 2:282 ) - ( court testimony ) `` and call to witness , from among your men , two witnesses . 
  and if two men be not found then a man and two women . '', 
  and so on ... this is not an extremist interpretation of islam , this is what every `` educated '' ( in islamic texts ) sunni muslim will believe , because it 's the commandments that muhammad wrote in the qur ` an/hadith . 
  ah yes , i remember those arguments years ago too - `` they will just drop their religion alltogether '' . 
  years later and islam is actually growing , not shrinking in europe . 
  when will your type get their heads out of their ass and realize the muslims that come to europe are n't `` starstruck by the awesomness '' of atheism and drop their religion within one , max-two generations ? 
  when will you realize they actually end up growing even more hard-core muslims with the next generations , and that many terrorists have in fact not just been born in europe , but attended good universitites , been exposed to atheism 's ideas and * still * end up hard-line islamists ? 
  your delusions and hopes are n't working and we 're all paying for this . 
  islam wo n't magically decline and fade like christianity did , not before it takes over all of europe , spends centuries as the institutional religion and eventually gets rotted from ideas within . 
  i ca n't wait for that , i want it out now . 
  it 's quite arrogant and self-centered to consider that no people like yourself might actually live there . 
  i ' v spoken to some myself , young boys from aleppo who played in a rock-band and dreamed to live in a country as free as the european ones . 
  there were plenty of them protesting agaisnt assad during the arab spring and it 's behind them that the west rallied , as i believe was our obligation . 
  they are dead now or displaced , so only the radicals have remained , but because it came to this does n't mean it was such from the start . 
  the west would ' v had `` blood on their hands '' if it had supported assad when he started shooting against those boys and girls that protested peacefully back in 2010 . 
  it was n't the west 's decision to stand with those people against the regime that was butchering them that was wrong , it was the west 's overconfidence it would fall as quickly as it did in tunisia and doing close to nothing because of that . 
  also russia 's blocking of the establishment of a no-fly zone , which would take away assad 's biggest advantage and the barrel-droping that is basically reponsible for 90 % the destruction in the larger cities . 
  i know that very well , yet fail to see how it 's relevant to my comment - the article was meant to show eu states with high percentage muslim populations and failed to show the one with the highest . 
  bulgaria has 13 % muslims , the highest of any eu state , so pretty relevant to the topic , yet not included . 
  no , a jar-jar one . 
  they show 8 % as if it 's supposed to be nothing , compared to the perception of people . 
  when in fact 8 % muslims in one of europe 's major nations is fucking staggering . 
  there used to be not 1 % merely half a century ago . 
  what are we to expect in another half a century , especially considering the ammount of demands for social change and accomodation to their cultural values they have now , at 8 % . 
  it 's like poetry , it rhymes . 
  every scene from history is so dense , there 's so much going on at once . 
  fair enough , i wo n't . 
  i understand the rules and have never once gone into personal attacks against people i argue with here , but in that case i am warning people not to fall for the trap of a troll , who routinely copy-pastes the most baiting soviet-style statements meant to draw people and then does n't back them up or answer for any of his arguments . 
  it 's just meant to piss people off and waste their time , because they do n't know it 's a troll rather than a person who 'd defend his statements . 
  i warn them not to waste their time and that 's a bad thing , how ? 
  russia 's position in ww2 and its invasion were actually a direct consequence of its aggressive policy . 
  stalin had no border with hitler before he created one for himself by splitting eastern europe according to the molotov-ribbentrop co-operation between the two . 
  and stalin was a horrible administrator and even more inept war leader , who cost the ussr dearly in manpower through horribly wrong decisions . 
  he basically served it to hitler on plate after he decapitated the army in his purges . 
  we seem to think alike when we hear that about russia . 
  is that not what i posted ? 
  not sure what your arguments are trying to say . 
  they seem to agree with mine . 
  if not , be a bit more direct . 
  nor did i say they will . 
  you can have an economical or social disaster without booting the leader out . 
  besides , if someone removes putin at all it would certainly not be the people , but his oligarchs . 
  i am quite rossohpobic myself but i ca n't say seeing a disaster that leaves millions impoverished , suffering and dying of the consequences would give me a pleasure . 
  a peaceful dissolution of russia into an ethnic nation state forgone its imperial ambitions like turkey , peaceful like japan and liberal like germany , would give me immense satisfaction . 
  just the usual friendly warning guys for those of you who wo n't notice it at first - this is u/sarmatae , a usual bulgarian troll who literary copies every single soviet , not even putinist , but pure soviet propaganda and rethoric on almost every thread . 
  ( even as far as to defend at one point the occupation of his own country and cheer the mass murder that followed it ) arguing with him would equal you just turning on some old recording of soviet state news and arguing with the tv set . 
  spare yourself that and silence the troll by ignoring him , he does n't answer any arguments anyway since , naturally , he ca n't - he 's only here to bait . 
  [ relevant ] ( http://s3.pikabu.ru/post_img/big/2014/03/24/3/1395624086_1767536185.jpg ) russia seems to be on the verge of social and economic collapse every 40-50 years or so . 
  the russian revolution and civil war , the second world war , the collapse of the ussr ... life from one crisis to the next every few decades with a lot of pretences for `` great power '' in between . 
  `` look how powerful tzarist russia is !! '', 
  - `` ooops , it just collapsed under the bolshevik civil war ... '' `` but hey , now look how powerful stalin is ! '', 
  - `` ooops half his cuntry just burned and almost collapsed under the german invasion . 
  good thing the americans sent all that land lease '' `` but hey , now look how powerful the nuclear ussr is ! '', 
  - `` ooops it just crumbled under its own economic and social inneficiency into a 90s third world country '' `` but hey , now look how powerful the new putinist russia is !! '', 
  ooops , the oil prices and the ruble just collapsed ... until next time , folks ... 
  much original , very edgy , wow . 
  must be a popular kid i 'm talking to , with all them dank 9gag memes he repeats . 
  lots of sex in the new testament ? 
  it actually has . 
  all wars were ended when one side got the upper hand and `` shot and killed its way to peace '' . 
  it 's a stalemate that results in no side being too strong to win or too weak to lose that perpetuates a conflict . 
  joining or leaving major organisations and alliances should require 2/3 of the vote , rather than pass if just a few percent over the half have swung one way or another . 
  it states bulgaria , but i 'm not bulgaria for you to write `` bulgaria has something to say '' . 
  i am myself , a person with this and this argument , you can try and refute it or admit you were wrong . 
  instead you choose to look at what my flair is and start attacking that country to divert the attention from the fact your statements were proven wrong . 
  just like a kindergartner . 
  and you keep doing it :  also apparently bulgaria is so terrible even potatoes do n't want to grow there .
