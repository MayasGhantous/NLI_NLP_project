  would n't people follow it in doing so as they did to the north ? 
  if bulgaria saved its jews , why would n't greece do the same as an axis country ? 
  why the hell do you keep talking about bulgaria , in a comment i made about greece ? 
  it is msot certainly ad hominem , if you diverge the whole topic and my statement about greece towards another country , just because i have its flag . 
  macedonia was german jurisdiction , the bulgarian army had no say there . 
  where it did have a say , in bulgaria , none were shipped . 
  it so happens my dissertation for ba was on why barbarossa failed . 
  i reaserched the timeline day by day - they had plenty of time . 
  it was strategic decisions that made them fail , such as the kiev pocket or stopping the panzer groups of army group centre from storming towards moscow after minsk . 
  my country ( poland ) was the first to fight the nazis , so your pathetic ad hominem does n't work here . 
  greece does n't equal `` everyone in the world '' . 
  those who could stop hitler should ' v fought him , and done so in the 1930s . 
  instead they , the great powers , appeased him , left him expand , annex austria , occupy czechoslovakia and eventually manage to become the dominant power in the continent , with a few tiny states left . 
  those tiny states were left alone on the continent dominated by the huge third reich - were they supposed to stop him ? 
  was it up to greece to defeat the third reich ? 
  oh no , wait , they were just supposed to sacrifice themselves and millions of their citizens to make a point , right ? 
  about `` standing up agaisnt hitler '' ? 
  spare me the bs , had greece joined the axis it would ' v saved hundreds of thousands of its people and jewish communities that were more than 2 thousand years old . 
  if they could do it , they should ' v done it , and you ' v no right to demand otherwise of it or any other tiny eur country left alone with the wehrmacht on its borders by the failures of the great powers . 
  hitler was not a threat until the great powers left him become so , or actively aided him in becoming as the ussr did . 
  so it 's up to them to fix their mess and sacrifice millions of their people in the process , not up to the tiny states that were not responsible for it to send their people to death and destroy their cities for someone else 's mistake . 
  such a horrific part of history . 
  perhaps had n't mussolini invaded greece it might have joined the axis once it had the wehrmacht on its borders and save its jewish population as bulgaria did . 
  shame it did n't happen . 
  edit : getting downvoted for being sorry the jews of greece were n't saved . 
  is this turning into r/european ? 
  at first glance i thought the title was someone called lee acaster describing wales as a `` disused slate quarry '' , thinking it 'll be an article about the condition wales is in . 
  `` undercover '' ( pod prikritie ) is a great cop drama from bulgaria that became a hit worldwide and got released on netflix , aired in the us , germany and many other countries . 
  i highly recommend it for lacking a lot of cliche `` hollywoodian '' tropes , but rather being quite down to earth , gritty and realistic . 
  and a beautiful serb . 
  true . 
  as [ saban bajramovic ] ( http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/image/4808860-4x3-340x255.jpg ) is a 100 % pure pravi srbin . 
  just loosing people is one kind of tragedy . 
  replacing them with different nationalities/ethnicities/cultures is making it worst . 
  one makes your country less populated , the other makes your country less ... yours . 
  the little detail being that as they lived in the are `` for centuries '' they were seeing themselves as bulgarians over 90 % . 
  only recently was `` macedonism '' created by the yugoslavs post-ww2 and imposed as an identity . 
  how about `` west bulgaria '' ? 
  or the nation of tsar lazar ? 
  do n't forget , most balkan historical figures were pure breed makedonids . 
  and yet [ lactobacillus bulgaricus ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus ) - the natural ingredient into original yoghurt only grows in bulgaria and is named after it . 
  even the science says it 's bulgarian mate . 
  there are coal mines merely 20 km from the city at pernik , so yes . 
  at least neither me nor my dad ever smoke a cigarrette ( tabbaccoo ones ) in our entire lives so maybe that 's mitigating some of the effects . 
  yeah i get that confusion often . 
  living in bulgaria i just think it 's more approriate to use the local flag , especially since i often argue about the country and its history on this forum .

  pretty much the same applies to [ sozopol ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=sozopol&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmi95p8t8x7yaivbypych0ioge4&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282 ) .

  ** ski resorts ** : [ borovec ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=borovec&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmilsdtgcb7yaivpp9ych14wqoz&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282 ) , [ pamporovo ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=pamporovo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchminyjahmb7yaivgvdych3sgwh8&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282 ) and [ bansko ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=bansko&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmi56s6imb7yaivxuhych2euqpu&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282 ) are all quite developped ski resorts with a lot of ski lanes and hotels . 
  alternatively , the capital sofia itself lies [ at the slopes ] ( http://kupatanavitosha.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sofia-vitosha-kempinski.jpg ) of mount vitosha , which also has ski lanes . 
  ** cities and towns ** : [ veliko tarnovo ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=tarnovo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmi5lyf0mb7yaivhrbych0feaii&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282#tbm=isch&amp;q=veliko+tarnovo ) is my personal favourite town in bulgaria , a small one but with an amazing architecture and impressive [ fortress ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=tarnovo&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmi5lyf0mb7yaivhrbych0feaii&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282#tbm=isch&amp;q=veliko+tarnovo+tsarevets ) - the capital of the second bulgarian empire . 
  [ plovdiv ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=plovdiv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmiwve6g8f7yaivbv5ych2ptqn0&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282 ) is europe 's third oldest city , one of few with a completely preserved amphitheatre and an amazing old town . 
  the capital [ sofia ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=sofia+bulgaria&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmi1va6pmf7yaivar5ych3tqw2s&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282 ) is not really considered a tourist destination , but as a foreigner living here i ' v fallen in love with it . 
  the city centre is a charmful , quiet and pretty little piece of central-european athmosphere , whilst the mountain next to the city gives it a breathtaking [ view ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byp_-bk0-74&amp;index=89&amp;list=flsiupgqawarzoer0ta1hyia ) . 
  [ rilski monastery ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=rilski+monastery&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cacq_auoawovchmitbcfhsv7yaivaavych0x9aml&amp;biw=1119&amp;bih=282 ) is an absolute must-see in my opinion . 
  there 's a [ ton of other places ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsodz71rs7q ) i 'm missing , it takes years to see them all . 
  it 's a bit ironic that my father is from krakow and i live in sofia - both cities rank top in air pollution in europe for the exact same reason - situated in valleys yet having expanded substantially , there is little wind or current to dispers the effects of cars and industry . 
  it 's like a curse of my family to live in a bad-air quality city no matter the country . 
  as a historian , i absolutely loved every minute in rome and barely saw anything of what i had planned in the 10 days i spent there . 
  people are far too pretencious to focus on the negative aspects most large cities have when they can see such an astonishing ammount of history and art in one of history 's most important places . 
  the vatican alone is worth a visit to the city . 
  `` sunny beach '' - it 's a shithole with 100 or more huge hotels and a thousand clubs that have completely devastated the lovely area for the sake of 2 million drunk west/north european teens coming each summer . 
  there 's a ton of lovely places to visit in bulgaria and `` bloody beach '' is not one of them , despite being the most popualr, 
  fair enough . 
  but i ' v heard this attitude plenty of times whilst doing my bachelors in history at cov uni and never really got it . 
  even some of my teachers talked about the catholics of that time as if they were some foreign aliens who ' v come to bring papism , rather than part of the nation simply refusing to abandon their centuries old tradition and church . 
  i think it 's rather baffling why such a double meaning exists in the english language , when there 's actually no shortage of words for each exact type - there 's castle , palace , fort , fortress , mansion etc. 
  yet they use castle for a whole bunch of very different buildings . 
  this is a `` castle '' - [ kimbolton castle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/kimbolton_castle_01.jpg ) and this is also a castle - [ bodiam castle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/castle_bodiam1_cz.jpg ) . 
  why the hell not use the variety of words to call one a castle and the other a manor , residence , palace or chateau ? 
  is n't `` schloss '' translated as palace ? 
  palace basically being an expensive residence either built to be such ( like neuschwanstein ) or repurposed from an original castle ( like prague ) . 
  why is it `` they '' and `` we '' - was n't all of england catholic for centuries and `` them '' was actually native english people who just did n't abandon the church ? 
  it almost sounds like you ' r describing foreign invaders , not native people holding on to their traditions . 
  yet such a transfer is n't occurring at all now , with n.ir . 
  dragging behind the rest of hte country and having a significantly smaller growth of 0.8 % . 
  unless it goes into recession with a unification , it ca n't really get worse , can it ? 
  but the `` slavs with massive memory wipe and implantation of fake memories '' is all the serbs ' fault . 
  thanks , srbja !, 
  you are correct , in that i do n't know what this discussion is about either . 
  i think it started from me questioning whether poland was conquered by russia 5 times or 2 times . 
  still useless though . 
  `` you are a murderer '' `` yes , but so are many people on earth '' fuck logic . 
  are n't these part of the partitions and the 1939-89 periods i mentioned ? 
  they are suppressing liberation rebellions , not conquests . 
  unless you believe it 's comparable feat to take moscow and to suppress a bunch of untrained freedom fighters by the world 's largest army ? 
  most european countries have a consistent policy towards things like separatism on internal and external stage . 
  spain does n't agree with letting catalonia go , and it is consistent with this on international stage by not recognising kosovo , despite most of spain 's union and allies doing so . 
  when germany supports democracy and popular elections in eritrea or north korea , it also practices such at home . 
  russia on the other hand pretends to be defending peope 's right to determination in neighbouring countries , but then denies that to those within it . 
  if on one hand you consider russia taking kresy `` liberation '' ( as if they were ever part of it ) , that implies they were n't polish , so it ca n't be considered occupation of poland the way the poles occupied moscow . 
  either only the last partition , that took ethnic poland is to be counted , or all of them but by considering the entirety of the commonwealth as `` polish land '' . 
  the deluge was swedish .
