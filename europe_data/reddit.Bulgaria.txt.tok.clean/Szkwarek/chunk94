  perhaps treating drugs the same way will have those effects too . 
  those countries do n't want them , nor do they want those countries . 
  so why force two groups of people into a disfunctional relationship ? 
  ahh yes , original names , like berlin 's west slavic berl-ibirl for swamp , right ? 
  when 's the official name restoration happening ? 
  i think they still have a higher gdp per capita , at least nominally , than poland , but indeed having pensions higher than the minimal sallary seems to me prepostereus . 
  all over eastern europe at least the minimal sallary is if not higher , equal to the avage pension . 
  it sounds a bit like gerontocracy to me . 
  in what way ? 
  how do their pensions compare to the sallaries ? 
  can pensions really upkeep more than one person ? 
  my grandparents get 250 eur pensions in poland , and it 's barely enough for one person . 
  i though pensions everywhere were enough for only a person . 
  what does a quatre of the work force live on atm ? 
  how to destroy a 1300 year old nation - impose 45 years of communist experiment , followed by 25 ( and counting ) years of crony capitalism by the same former communist nomenclature turned economic oligarchs . 
  in the grand scheme of things , what happened to our nation in 1944 will be considered even worst than the ottoman occupation in 1396 . 
  at least we survived as a nation the first , i 'm not so sure we 'll survive the second . 
  a loyal ally helps you protect yourself - that 's what alliances are for . 
  he does n't send his soldiers to die in a far away war that serves nothing but the greed of your political class and your geo-political ambitions . 
  a puppet does that . 
   that is not relevant if the result is the same . 
  but the result is n't the same as a direct nazi occupation that had the gestapo kidnap and torture/kill people regurarly , is it ? 
  how is anything remotely the same in current czech rep ? 
  you equate mundane eu regulations to direct military occupation by a totalitarian mass-murdering state for the sake of being a drama queen . 
  it 's pathetic dude . 
   neither did ussr or austria-hungary . 
  that 's among the dumbest things i ' v read on this sub . 
  this profound lack of history knowledge somewhat explains why you 'd make the comparison above . 
   your only valid argument . 
  but it 's not that simple , because the government keeps ignoring requests for czexit referendum . 
  your government does - the eu has no say in whether you have a referendum and leave or not . 
  if the brits can have one it shows it 's a matter of the nation wanting it enough , not the eu agreeing or holding you captive . 
   it 's a creeping federation . 
  it ca n't fucking decide on how to deal with a bunch of refugees , it ca n't fucking even protect its borders , but it 's a `` creeping federation '' . 
  spoooookie , it creeps with the speed of a snail it seems . 
  do n't make me laugh , the eu becoming a state is as probable as saudi arabia hosting the world gay convention . 
  but is till fail to understand why bank privacy should be a right . 
  your assets being public knowledge does n't hurt anyone , on the contrary , it allows for better prevention of corruption and illigal activities . 
  that 's a proper fun response and it ' l be upvoted for sure , i give you that , but the stupidity of his comparisson remains . 
  it 's like when people here compare the eu to the ussr , as if we were delcared war against and invaded to join it ... 
  it also protects him from hiding illigal earnings and bribes . 
  the public lynching investors of unpopular projects is n't as often as corrupt politicians , officials or criminals hiding their money there . 
  one of these does n't seem like the other . 
  one of these did n't invade you with an army . 
  one of these you applied to and they actually made you fulfill criteria to join them . 
  one of these allows you to leave at any given time . 
  one of these does n't supress rebellions with mass murder . 
  one of these is not even a state . 
  to equate them is to be either uneducated or a very over-dramatising populist . 
  this comment is not even supposed to be pro-eu , just anti-dumb comparissons . 
  ever seen [ a map of europe ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/extreme_points_of_europe.png ) ? 
  do germany and austria really [ seem in the middle ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/extreme_points_of_europe.png ) to you ? 
  why ? 
  the daily mail is one of , if not the most , read media and it 's strongly against the eu . 
  i apologize , then the question is - did you ruin a country and cause massive fallout that killed hundreds of thousands to this day because you are a puppet , or because you are greedy . 
  you ' r doing it yourself - the netherlands is an economy with such and such carbon footprint , you ' r part of that economy and enjoy the living standards it provides , in no small part due to its energy consuption that results in higher carbon footprint per capita than poland . 
  it 's hypocritical to accuse a poorer nation of its lower carbon footprint per capita whilst daily enjoying the benefits your higher-polluting per person economy gives you . 
  i 'm sure you very much enjoy your dutch sallary whilst being so `` condeming '' - go live on a polish sallary and then demand the economy ( and that sallary ) be further ruined for the sake of reducing carbon emissions . 
  it 's easy to say that whilst enjoying the high standard a more intensely polluting economy gives you . 
  if they do with granades in sweden , is it really that weird for grenade launchers in the balkans ? 
  why is it ? 
  [ veliko tarnovo ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=veliko+tarnovo+pictures&amp;biw=1098&amp;bih=250&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0cayq_auoawovchminl-9jsrnyaivxf0sch050wkk#tbm=isch&amp;q=%d0%92%d0%b5%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%be+%d0%a2%d1%8a%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be+pictures ) is a small town in bulgaria that used to be the capital of the second bulgarian empire . 
  the tsars ' fortress is still breathtaking and the 19th century-style old town is really charming . 
  stories of russia deporting hundreds of thousands that ended up dying is n't really `` obscure '' . 
  kinda reoccuring theme in russian history , like `` a us armed intervention '' or `` a chinese civil war '' . 
  i do n't . 
  let 's have a vote . 
  but we ' r not obliged to abide by the 19th century pan-germanic concept of what is central germany now , do we ? 
  we can decide it 's the 21st century and we can have a more modern and objective definition - one that takes into consideration that germany is n't even half way to the centre of the continent when going from the west ? 
  a pointless thread to anyone that does n't know who this person is . 
  it 's like this is r/bulgaria . 
  put in the title that he 's a shady businessmen/oligarch or nothing at all . 
  europe ends at the ural mountains . 
  its [ geographic centre ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/extreme_points_of_europe.png ) is in estonia or belarus ( depending on the north-south border ) . 
  there 's zero criteria by which germany is n't firmly a `` western european nation '' - be it geographic , economic , geo-political etc. 
  it 's the war that happened most recently in terms of a major international invasion . 
  it lasted more than a decade ending barely a few years ago . 
  it is the most obvious example of the uk blindly following the us ' interrests , thus relevant to what we are currently talking about . 
  its effects are very much felt today , with a lot of what is going on in the mid-east ( and now in europe with teh migrants ) being directly correlated to this war . 
  and despite all of this you do n't see why it 's a relevant war that can pop-up in many topics and discussions ? 
  well i do n't actually believe it - i think you see that very clearly , but choose to merely dismiss it as `` 16 year old males and their hormones '' because : a ) you are ashamed of what the crime your state did and the horrible , decades-to-come long implications of it . 
  or b ) you have no way of justifying it and just want people to shut up about it already . 
  or both . 
  before i 'm accused of the usual when criticising the us - being `` on the other side '' with russia , anti-us leftists etc. 
  - no , i am quite russophobic , centre-right wing and with no affiliation to the anti-western left . 
  i am pro-nato and pro-eu , but that does n't mean i ca n't see the crime that the iraq war was for what it is . 
  that 's not half the eu and as i thought - you continue to avoid the one question that disproves your point . 
  there 's zero reason for the uk to invade iraq , other than washington 's decision to do so . 
  your obvious escape from that question shows you yourself realize the uk acts like a puppet , but have to deny it to save face . 
  fair enough , save face , `` you ' r not a puppet '' - go sleep well now . 
  they did n't , please inform yourself . 
  and i ask once again , give me the reasons the uk went to war in iraq . 
  if it 's an independent country , it must have pretty strong internal reasons to go to the ultimate action in international relations - war . 
  what were these extremely strong internal reasons for the uk to do that ? 
  what 's with the czech euroscepticism ? 
  but it 's still somewhat hypocritical that russia would persecute any notion of separatism within the non-russian regions , whilst holding `` world separatist conventions '' in moscow and openly supporting seaparatists in other ( neighbouring ) countries . 
  so let me get that straight - you do n't think that if a country goes to war , actual costly , deadly war , over and over again , for the interrests of another country - it is acting like a puppet ? 
  what reasons did britain have to go to war in iraq ? 
  tell me one . 
  who says they are n't getting labelled this way ?
