  and once again , for the 5th time in a row , you avoid discussing any of the actual matters on hand - be it incentivising birth rates in ageing societies or how would you rather save e.european countries from the collapse that this low birth rates will bring . 
  instead , you go on your rants about politics and the right in general . 
  now reaching a point where to you all `` right wing politics '' is nazi and will inevitably lead to genocide . 
  you are the epitome of a political fanatic and a blind radical . 
  which puts you closer to the nazis you keep warning about than the vast majority of the `` political right '' . 
  * i chose you as my favourite moderator . 
  go on , check if you can , you have my permission . 
  oh how horrible - `` traditional '' families with kids . 
  `` our people '' at that . 
  i shiver at the thought . 
  families having children , europeans not collapsing under the strain of an ageing labour force - that 's literaly the holocaust dude , i 'm glad people like you see it and fight against it . 
  because i defended protectionism ? 
  or did i merely explain the mechanic of the east-west relationship within the eu ? 
  pick one . 
  dude , do you realize how a person sounds when in discussing one topic he constantly goes off the rails talking about his frustration with general things of a political spectrum ? 
  you opposed the incentive of births and openly admited supporting pop . 
  growth was `` racist '' and `` right-wing '' . 
  then you refuse to explain in any way how this , in particular , is wrong , instead filling your posts with examples of other things you percieve bad - the nazis , the pork lunches etc. 
  you give no constructive explanation about the thing on hand - the incentive for births , and rather go on rants about other things . 
  which shows you have no actual arguments against this policy , but because you * need * to oppose it as all things politically right , you have to somehow connect it to other right-wing policies indirectly . 
  that 's such a wide mental-gymnastics , meant to dismiss a perfectly good thing ( increasing e.european fertility rates ) , purely out of political spite , that i ca n't possibly see it as anything different from the rational of ultra-biased political radicals like the fascists or bolsheviks . 
  it 's ironic you 'd oppose those whilst thinking and rationalising stuff like them . 
  jesus dude you sound like a 10 year old on call of duty . 
  please take some time , then come back and look at your comments , they are embarassing . 
  because he is . 
  i 'm not even joking - he was [ the security guard of bulgaria 's former communsit leader ] ( http://www.novini.bg/uploads/news_pictures/2011-36/big/boijko-borisov-todor-jivkov-ima-traijno-mqsto-v-istoriqta-21521.jpg ) . 
  also a firefighter , owner of a security company in the 90s ( meaning he was a mobster , the 90s were our mombster era after the collapse ) , then head of the police , and finally mayor of the capital and now 2 time prime minsiter . 
  imagine al capone as potus . 
  and what horrible attrocities will poland use the extra children born thanks to an incentive programme for ? 
  what despicable acts will the right be able to achieve by supporting a stable population and saving a country from the catastrophe that ageing is ? 
  you are literary trying to justify the catastrophic eastern european ageing just because the right happens to act against it . 
  that 's letting politics cloud your judgment to the fanatical point of defending horrendeus social developments just for the sake of opposing your political opponents . 
  it 's the same level of blind political fanaticism the nazis you talk of had . 
  no , poland has the third lowest ( 1.29 ) after portugal ( 1.21 ) and spain ( 1.27 ) . 
  the eu-28 average is 1.55 , ireland has 1.96 , sweden has 1.89 and the uk has 1.83 . 
  not only is fertility rate abyssmally small in poland , it also does n't have the immigration of the western states . 
  instead , it has emigration contributing even further . 
  i 'd say 500 zl . 
  is even too little towards solving this most pressing issue . 
  if the military can be modernized with tens of billions , then families can be supported too . 
  do you disagree with this comment ? 
  will the eu give back all the money poland lost as a result of being part of the common-market ? 
  the money going into the former east block is comparable to the money those countries lose by participating in the free market , which forbids them from protecting local producers from getting crushed by the larger corporations in the industrialized centre , who establish monopolies in the east block and suck the markets dry off capital . 
  the large groceries chains like billa here in bulgaria alone suck out reportedly around 600 million eur out of the country each year , and have already driven out of business thousands of both local producers ( they prefer importing ) and local retailers . 
  usually the country could do smth . 
  to protect itself from that , but not if it 's in the free market of the eu - it 's considered protectionism and a violation . 
  when applied this to all sectors of the economy you end up with a huge loss of any periphery country to participate - which is what the eu grants are for . 
  to mitigate those loses for the sake of allowing their corporations free and premium access to the eastern markets . 
  stop thinking it 's `` free money '' - it is n't , it 's compensation to those countries for `` spreading their legs '' to your producers , corporations , financial institutions and retail chains . 
  it ensures the country does n't collapse under the weight of pensions vs. young workers as a result of ageing . 
  something desperately needed in rapidly ageing eastern europe ( and germany ) . 
  not sure why you 'd try and smear at as some sort of `` white power '' slogan . 
  has the left now gone as far as to label reproduction a `` racist '' or `` far-right '' thing ? 
  followed high-school gf to uni there . 
  not a bad uni but the town 's a chav 's paradise . 
  lol , `` decent '' . 
  the solution was n't to outright say fuck it to the eu law and bordes , and demand other countries take in the people as a result . 
  plenty other decisions could ' v been taken , as for example the establisment of camps on lybian and syrain coastlines for those waiting to get asylum permits , whilst any who bypass the camps and just go to europe be treated as illegals for deporation back to those camps . 
  use your imagination - enforcing the borders and rules of the eu is n't impossible , albeit much harder than just giving in and demanding the others carry the burden of your resignation . 
  everything is absolutely black and white / good and bad . 
  nothing in between - there 's only us , the good pro-immigration/multicultralism people , and them - the bad anti-immigrationists , who are racists and nazis . 
  this is what comes from your post and it is the exact same way of thinking of the terrorist - he just had `` us white people / them non-white peope '' instead , but the good/bad - is/them simplification was the same . 
  exactly what in the article led you to think that . 
  or are you just on about something unrelated cause you did n't actually read it ? 
  or immortal bodies . 
  we ' r not getting either of these soon so what 's your point ? 
  quite unrelated , but what happened to that town reminds me of when at the start of ww1 they would still group formations based on which region/town they come from . 
  when the unexpected massacre of the first months of the war hit , often a town would lose all of its men in a single afternoon as their company was the one in the vanguard getting completely wiped out . 
  they soon changed that formation policy precisely to avoid communities suffering the huge blow this french community has suffered today . 
  why ? 
   are you aware of the meaning of the word sovereignty . 
  i know it 's just nittpicking , but you formally did n't have that untill 1908 . 
  so no , my country did n't attack a sovereign state . 
  besides , unlike your invasions that war did n't have people 's support . 
  sure dude , spin at all you want , bulgarian principality existed as much as serbia or any other state , with borders , capital , government , monarch , army ... 
  it was sovereign enough to take away eastern rumelia from the ottoman empire and make ready to fight it , but was n't sovereign enough to be considered an invasion by the serbs ? 
  you are getting pathetic with these attempts to deny your direct and first backstabbing of us . 
  you serbs will do just anything to victimise your history and deny any wrongdoing to make yourself a holy cow in the balkans . 
   i think the right term is '' kicked you out of disputed territories '' . 
  `` disputed '' only because the serbs had put their armies there , not disputed to anyone else , since all achnolwedged its bulgarian ethnic composition .

  you turned our macedonia into what is your bosnia , and for that reason i am delighted you lost your region as well . 
   you know , when people mention fascism/nazism today they tend to think about more than just socio-economic-political system . 
  they do indeed , when fascism and actions are meant today . 
  when discussing the 1930s and 40s there are very specific few fascist countries entirely based on the particular socio-political system of the time . 
  same as today we might call `` communist '' this or that politician with certain left-wing views , but when discussing the cold war there are very specific communist countries and the term is n't up for interpretation . 
  bulgaria was not a fascist country at any point , it never had a fascist party ruling unilateraly , a totalitarian system with it or any of the main traits of fascist systems . 
  it had various degrees of authoritarianism , repression and jingoism - the things you describe , but so did many other states we do n't call fascist , and in fact almost all states prior to the 20th century . 
   fighting alongside hitler nope , bulgaria refused to sent any troops to his fronts even under increasing threat . 
  it never declared war on the ussr or send soldiers to the eastern front . 
  bulgarians had one goal only - finish the unification of the country with macedonia , dobrudza and thrace . 
  it sent soldiers only there , and nowhere else to fight no one else 's wars . 
  serbia united its lands ( or rather was given that by the great powers post ww1 ) , but you hypocritically deny bulgaria 's attempts to do the same . 
   using nazi methods in dealing with the one you label as '' unwanted '' nope , none of that either . 
  as i said , there was no fascist party or fascism ruling bulgaria , the minorities that the nazis wanted deported to the camps got defended when the people themselves rose up and blocked train stations . 
  not many nations have done [ such a thing ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/how-bulgaria-saved-its-jews-from-nazi-concentration-camps/2013/05/08/e866bdda-8cb1-11e2-9838-d62f083ba93f_story.html ) in history , which can be described as the very opposite nature of nazism and fascism . 
   my country did n't attack a sovereign country yep it did - in 1885 , which you still have n't addressed , as no serbs ever do cause it will break your self-victimisation that we are the backstabbers , and not you . 
  also in [ 1913 the serbo-greek alliance ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek%e2%80%93serbian_alliance_of_1913 ) after the first balkan war was aimed precisely at attacking bulgaria . 
  hence the bulgarian pre-emptive strike . 
   and then procede to do what you did to the people on those territories .
