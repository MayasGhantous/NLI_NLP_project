  yep , you certainly [ did that ] ( http://genocide-in-macedonia.blogspot.bg/2009/08/bulgarians-in-thrace-macedonia-and-asia.html ) to hundreds of thousands of bulgarians in macedonia . 
   mention ` bulgaria ' and this would be my first association . 
  that 's about it , i do n't go back in 1300s . 
  you do n't want to go to much more recently , to 1885 , as i already mentioned a few times , precisely because then you are the one with the knife . 
  and whilst we attacked you to take our own region , our version of what kosovo is to you - you backstabbed us only to prevent our unification . 
  and after centuries of common fight against the turks , only years after bulgarians fought in the serb independence war . 
  you seem to jump topics without much connection . 
  you base your entire premise on me denying the macedonians today to be what they want to be . 
  i do n't - they can be africans for all i care , so what was the point of your answer ? 
  you claimed bulgaria was a fascist state , that 's where the whole discussion came along , and provided its occupation to you , liberation to me , of macedonia as argument for this . 
  i countered that your country did the same , as did many in history , is serbia and all others who occupied fascist ? 
  or do you just do n't know what a fascist system is , which is the more likely answer , and are just regurgitating meaningless slurs the serbs love making up . 
  next time add `` tatar '' to fascists , i know you love using this one as well , and it 's quite fitting , since it shows equal lack of historical knowledge as when you use fascist . 
  there is no problem . 
  there are borders and rules , all well documented and signed up for by the member states . 
  then there are a few states that decide fuck the rules , fuck the borders , all wellcome . 
  but wait , now they ' v come - it 's your responsibility as well . 
  that 's much more like a 5 year old - i broke the rules and made the mess , but now you all take care of the fallout cause i said so . 
   i think attacking your neighbouring country , occupying parts of it , slaughtering civilians , trying to turn the local population into bulgarians through the import of bulgarian priests and teachers , forbidding public use of local languages , burning books in those languages , killing intelectualls etc. 
  could be put into '' and much more '' when it comes to fascism and fascist methods , do n't you agree ? 
  so you would agree then serbia after 1913 and 1915 was a fascist state , would you ? 
  what you describe above is precisely what they did to the bulgarians in macedonia after they took the region in the balkan wars . 
  a region all ethnography of the time proves was inhabited with [ bulgarians ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/balkans-ethnic_%281861%29.jpg ) . 
  we also have stories of the serbs doing the things you described to our people there . 
  there 's even the even of your [ king slapping ] ( https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%92%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0_%d0%97%d0%be%d0%b9%d1%87%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%b0 ) a girl for saying she 's a bulgarian there . 
  many were n't so lucky and got killed by the serb occupation instead . 
  so i suppose by your own standards desribed above you will agree we should historically classify serbia as a fascist state at the time ? 
  as for backstabbing and who deserves what - after centuries of bulgarians and serbs fighting together the turks , after thousands of bulgairans died in the serb war of indepndence , it was n't the bulgarians who broke that friendship and backstabbed . 
  although the serbs love forgetting and playing the victim , it was in 1885 that the serbs backstabbed the bulgarians . 
  when bulgaira united with the part of it that was left turkish vassal , the entire army gathered at the ottoman border awaiting to defend its unification . 
  instead , the serbs attacked from the west to stop it . 
  sometimes history is just and their bigger , better-equipped army was so badly devastated by the newly formed bulgarian army , that they almost got ot belgrade before the austrians stepped in to demand a return ot the status quo . 
  this is when the friendship ended and we owed you nothing anymore . 
  you ca n't call it `` backstabbing '' when it ; s not your friend that attacks you , and we were n't as soon as your army stepped into our country in 1885 . 
  as for our `` backstabbings '' - every single one of them resulted from serbia 's occupation of our macedonia in 1912 . 
  every single one of them had the goal of returning that region , not taking nish or belgrade . 
  so it 's defnitely not the same as your pure backstabbing in 1885 . 
  i do n't know , and neither does the article , since there 's zero mentioning of anyone remotely speaking of poland leaving the eu . 
  read the fucking articles before commenting for fuck 's sake . 
  what should i ask the people in macedonia - did alexander the great speak a slavic language , or was their `` nation '' the oldest in the world , or did they name the city of venice from a princess called `` veleta '' ( says so in their history books ) ... ? 
  asking these brainwashed idiots anythin related to history is hilarious . 
  the people in what is today macedonia [ were predominantly bulgarians ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3e60jm/when_did_macedonia_become_a_primarily_slavic/ctc9p8x ) for centuries up until the yugo brainwashing turned them into clowns imagining all world history is belongs to their `` ancient '' nation . 
  besides , i 'm not sure if you understand what fascism is . 
  you are clearly implying bulgaria occupied macedonia , rather than liberating it from serb occupation , but even then - occupation is n't fascism . 
  fascism is a complex socio-political system . 
  it includes a one-party totalitarian system , obligatory youth paramilitary organisations , state corporatism and much more . 
  do tell me , if you ' r such an expert on bulgairan history , which of the basic requirements for fascism were seen in bulgaria ? 
  show me the `` bulgarian fascist party '' that ruled in a one-party system and imposed totalitariansim ? 
  which is what happened to all the polish home army resistance fighters - they either died fighting the nazis , or were later executed/sent to syberia by the soviets . 
  he 's got all the right to compare them to fire and tsunami - both ruin your stuff , both kill you . 
  90 % of its territory being barely ihabited canadian tundra , australian deserts or african savannah . 
  india being the only substantial colony , and it alone was nowhere near enough to make the empire the largest in history . 
  at its height the british empire controlled 25.2 % of the world population - at its height persia did 33.4 % . 
  at its height britain had a number of rivals and needed alliances to protect itself . 
  at its height rome had zero rivals and needed no one . 
  stop looking at all the pink on the map and more on the details and context . 
  `` the sun never sets on '' was actually meant for the spanish empire . 
  only much later used for the british one as well . 
  they did n't fight against no fascism in bulgaria and surely did n't liberate the country . 
  it was not an occupied country , it even managing to save its jews against hitler 's demands . 
  despite its alliance with the reich it also managed to refuse to declare war against the ussr and not a single bulgarian soldier fought on the eastern front . 
  by sep. 1944 the germans had been expulsed and the country was preparing to join the allies . 
  then moscow declared war on the 5th of september and entered the country on the 9th . 
  how the hell is that remotely a `` liberation '' ? 
  it was an aggression and occupation by an expansionist totalitarian state , which wanted to grab as much land as it could in the end of the war , and this ruined our country till this day . 
  these soldiers are an occupation force in bulgaria , so their monuments are what wehramcht ones would be in france . 
  wan na take a ride ? 
  so did i. 
  then i spent 4 years in cov . 
  what 's a `` road '' ? 
  almost every sport on the olympics was created in greece . 
  triggered all the greeks, 
  with an adidass tracksuit on , next to a volkswagen golf 3 car with tuning . 
  what a heartless bastard i am , not supporting the people and policies i believe make society and the economy work worse , thus causing more suffering in the long term than solving . 
  paying off a traffic cop in the us is magnitutes more difficult or dangerous than it is in romania or bulgaria . 
  i ' v done it in both these countries . 
  i do n't know , since i have n't seen any such stats for them , but i see you have . 
  care to show us too ? 
  the presence of these 10 % muslims , particurarly in closed off communities , is most certainly worse than if these people were n't muslim . 
  for a variety of reasons , some of which i personally experienced when walking through schaarbeck in brussels with my girlfriend in a short skirt last summer , or when i lived for 4 years in coventry . 
  heard the same stories from friends in aarhus . 
  and overal their percentage is still tiny , around 5-6 % , yet we have how many attepts at forcing their culture on our societies , such as demand for their own courts in the uk or meals in france , no-alcohol zones in many cities etc. 
  i ca n't see an increase of muslims to a substantial percentage in europe that wo n't cause massive cultural clash and social cohesion . 
  no the question is what the hell is wrong with you - the guy asked op what * he * , personally prefers - cyrillic or latin . 
  not what the chechens as a whole use . 
  it was a personal question , as most in this thread , and you just come in intefering like a dickwad . 
  a war in turkey ? 
  in greece ? 
  in fyrom ? 
  in serbia ? 
  in croatia ? 
  in slovenia ? 
  in austria ? 
  in hungary ? 
  they ' v escaped the war the second they cross the syrian border . 
  stop giving me that bullshit . 
  one has nothing to do with the other . 
  the tragedies of our past do not make the possibility of even partially islamised europe any less of a tragedy . 
  they could n't build it like the [ bulgarian one ] ( http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/06/world/20150406-wall-slide-0tqv/20150406-wall-slide-0tqv-jumbo.jpg ) ? 
  so then you admit you ' r an eastern-european ?
