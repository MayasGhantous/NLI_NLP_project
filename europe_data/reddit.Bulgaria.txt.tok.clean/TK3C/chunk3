  did i miss something ? 
  send the bad blue boys , they 'll take care of it . 
  makes sense , they wo n't have the money to pay the traffickers for another try . 
  it is no wonder that things like that happen : http://glavpost.com/post/17sep2015/worldpolitics/59473-sergeev-73-strany-hotyat-lishit-rossiyu-prava-veto-v-oon.html 73 countries already demanded that russia is deprived of its veto right in un , their number will definitely increase now . 
  in our defence , we do n't have aegean islands either , 
  well about 20000 migrants are reported to be around odrin/edirne on their route to greek or bulgarian border . 
  looks like we do n't have that problem in eastern europe . 
  but well , public opinion is drastically different here , pro refugee people are a minority , i 'd say their numbers are not very different to those of the extreme right wing people . 
  the moderate opinion is that this issue has to be handled with extreme care . 
  and people do express their concerns . 
  largest news sites and tv networks have that self-imposed `` pro '' censorhip of course . 
  wo n't take long before people start to get proud of being called racist/nazi . 
  i wonder what 's going on next when those migrant guys start spending the welfare they get on handguns as well . 
  get the army back in the barracks . 
  return the police to the streets where it really belongs . 
  call the ferencvaros fans to deal with that , 
  we built a fence actually , even before hungary did . 
  with our own money that is , not eu funds . 
  we also made clear that illegal migrants trying to get as refugees are not welcome . 
  do n't ask me how , sufficient to say we were bashed for being evil racists the same way hungary is now , dw being especially nasty at its criticism . 
  we just did n't have the `` luck '' to have several thousands of them herding at the border so that we get on the headlines . 
  we do honor the eu migrant agreements . 
  as a result , police resources allocated to fight crime in our cities are re-allocated at the border and it is the same for months if not years . 
  the migrant wave problem is not new to us , it has been going on for at least 2 years , that 's why we started building our fence in 2013 . 
  we warned the eu about what is going to happen , the eurobureaucrats did not pay attention , they were too busy to blame us for building fence , not providing them better conditions in detention centers and so on . 
  we just did what we had to . 
  we did it too good actually , bulgaria is marked as `` migrant-unfriendly '' country in their `` guides '' . 
  in 2015 alone ( until september ) we have granted asylum to 12500 people , most of them from syria and iraq . 
  we 've caught more than 7000 illegals in the country , housing them in detention centers , we have stopped thousands from trying to cross the border illegally ( about 8000 ) . 
  that 's about we can do and it 's not much , for the last couple of years we have parts of sofia where immigrants are already a majority and skyrocketing crime in those areas . 
  for example , last week one syrian guy was stabbed to death in a knife fight by two illegals , one of them is in coma , the other is still not in condition to be asked by the police . 
  that happened right in the middle of the downtown , a high traffic area and security cameras everywhere . 
  their surgery and medical treatment is being paid by the government since they have n't ever paid a single stotinka to the healthcare fund ( or any tax whatsoever ) . 
  we are not a rich country , but we do honor the eu regulations . 
  please do not blame it on us . 
  we do as much as we can . 
  no , last time was in ww2  i do n't think most people here seriously believe macedonians are n't macedonians but brainwashed bulgarians ( yeah , nationalists do though and many more just post this shit in flame wars while they do n't really believe it ) . 
  same for the language ( which realistically though is closer to `` official '' bulgarian than some bulgarian dialects are ) . 
  it 's actually the ancient fairy tales , the kitschy monuments and some idiotic statements ( like that with the white macedonoid race ) , which pisses off most people here . 
  i personally never felt any animosity while in macedonia . 
  have n't seen that against macedonians that visit/live here either . 
  withdrew from ww1 ?!, 
  the same that happens in all dictatorships after the end of their dictator . 
  see libya , iraq , etc. 
  as a kid , i loved the fairy rings soup my grandparents prepared - they picked the mushrooms from the grasslands near the village they lived . 
  i also love marinated boletus with vinegar and parsley mmmm . 
  not quite into roasted mushrooms though . 
  this got ta be a good experiment . 
  first , use is declared . 
  next , putin activates his sleeping cells . 
  next , sleeping cells get slaughtered/detained . 
  next , things go back to its normal state and no more united states of europe bullshit . 
  you can ask your neighbours , the romanians , they will tell you something very similar regarding transinistria . 
  actually more like the russian ` democracy ', 
  true , russia must be destroyed for its vitiation of panslavism and othodoxy . 
  nice guys meh ... http://clubz.bg/ckfinder/userfiles/images/%d0%a1%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%ba%d0%b8%202/%d0%b1%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%ba%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b5%20%d0%be%d1%82%202008%20%d0%b3_.jpg, 
  no , that 's not an opinion , although i did try to be somewhat ironic . 
  i 've heard that justification for confiscation of private items a number of times ( though not from police officials ) - along the lines of `` we ca n't keep them locked in detention centers , we ca n't allow them to break the law further on , so we confiscate their stuff until investigation ends '' . 
  this investigation ( quite deliberately ) takes a lot of time and during that time they are forced by circumstances to get registered , fingerprinted and their status decided , here . 
  policemen robbing their personal belongings just for the sake of personal gain , not reporting that , acting like racketeers ? 
  i would n't be surprised at all if that happens , however i do n't think in reality that is common . 
  then again , government would n't mind if rumors like that spread . 
  they would n't confirm and they would n't emphatically deny that , instead they will state something like `` we do our best to protect our borders , following the bulgarian law '' . 
  that 's one part of the `` unofficial policy '' , the other being , the government quite deliberately seeks to build the image of a rather unhospitable place with racist police , volunteer teams with their `` citizen arrests '' ( such as those on the video ) . 
  al djazeera airing bulgarian border police resorting to force when arresting a group of people ? 
  great . 
  you may think that 's a leaked material , incidently shot by someone , reality is that they most likely helped the tv crew and literaly `` gave '' them the material they wanted . 
  that policy although not ethical , turned out to be effective and even getting mostly positive attitude from the voters . 
  there are lots of reasons for that , but discussing them is way offtopic . 
  i think you are the one that takes all that to extremes , i never mentioned `` far right '' , neither `` too leftist '' , nor `` extremely violent '' . 
  i also do n't know who are you referring to as `` us plebs '' . 
  i also did not comment on what 's morally right or wrong , just described the situation here , it 's not my personal opinion , it 's just a description of the situation here . 
  yet to be honest , i get some amusement from people like you that got somewhat offended by that . 
  so there is a small bonus for you , watch that video : http://vbox7.com/play:6a216c0e60 you are free to blame me for that too , i would n't be surprised if you picture me as one of those rednecks that shout `` go back !, 
  turkey !, 
  yeah , calm down , police is allowed to use force to arrest criminals that resort to violence in order to avoid being detained , are n't they . 
  and they can legally confiscate as much as they want , because ... expert reports need to be written , investigation undergoing ... it takes say 5 years ? 
  welcome to bureaucratic bulgaria . 
  you should have chosen another route , you got the short end of the stick and now you are fucked . 
  better luck next time . 
  well done little brothers , 
  no image of a tolerast here ? 
  [ and rome too ] ( http://storage1b.censor.net.ua/images/3/2/1/2/3212ab575cdb1d9346aadeeb9c2d9418/original.jpg ), 
  from what i know about armenians , i guess those azerbaijani soldiers will some day end up incidently falling from the stairs , stabbing themselves . 
  and then again and again ten more times . 
  mr. putin is a real robin hood . 
  he steals from the rich russian taxpayer and feeds the poor opressed european wackos . 
  is one of those `` shocking !, 
  bomb !, 
  it is getting really scary !, 
  disaster !, 
  it was foretold !, 
  scary new russian weapon !, 
  cia plan revealed ! '', 
  - type russian propaganda sites ? 
  if so , then banning this fecal site is the least you would do . 
  crap like this should be banned for insulting the nation 's intelligence . 
  hungarians must love rebranded dacia , 
  this clay belongs to the mighty bulgarian empire !!, 
  those look like football hooligans , not fascists .
