why is this not getting more attention ? 
  holy shit first it 's `` editing the title '' . 
  second its `` bad source '' . 
  what is it with you guys and loving hollande so much ? 
  almost as if europe is a continent of white people . 
  it 's just a prank , bro . 
  and turks are not 99.9 % anatolian lmao, 
  horse archer pride world wide, 
  not hungarians though . 
  they are 100 % asiatic . 
  turkish ancestral homeland really is mongolia though, 
  people do n't want erdogan gone ? 
  says the other mongol, 
  visiting the ancestral homelands ? 
  what ? 
  you 're saying france has to change it 's identity so muslims do n't feel inclined to become terrorists ? 
  i do n't understand what you 're saying . 
  france , you have no idea how much you 're pissing me off . 
  3 major terrorist attacks in your country in this and the last year . 
  and you 're still spouting the bullshit of # notallmuslims , which is obviously not true , considering you just saw the statistics . 
  how can you continue to defend this barbaric religion , when it 's killed hundreds of your countrymen . 
  who 's more important , the barbarians or your family ? 
  stop immigration from all muslim-majority countries in the middle east . 
  reminds me of this comic . 
  or you could close down mosques and close the borders for muslims . 
   where any comment even remotely positive about refugees or migrants is the post that gets downvoted to oblivion . 
  you 're saying it like there 's no reason behind it . 
  how is colonialism related to islam being a violent cult , creating fundamentalists and being responsible for almost all terrorist attacks around the world ? 
  closing the border for islam and the refugees `` seeking peace '' is a start . 
  nice attack , ahmed . 
  wan na bring it to the white house ? 
  prayfornice prayfororlando prayforbrussels prayforparis when does sympathy end and we get to action ? 
  almost all terrorist attacks are committed in the name of islam . 
  there 's a wikipedia page for it , it gets updated every week with a new attack being added . 
   this is about terrorism not religious fundamentalism wrong . 
  how many islamic terrorist attacks will it take for you to see it ? 
  at least the elderly do n't stab us in the back after we give them pills for blood pressure . 
  an overwhelming part of muslims hold extremist views that do not fit in with western civilization and values . 
  those who want `` help '' can go to saudi arabia , iran , morocco , egypt etc. 
  there 's no war there . 
  europe has no obligation to accept any muslims after all this . 
  trust me , balkan muslims are secular for the most part . 
  they do n't follow the quran and allah 's laws like the arab muslims do . 
  the actual devout muslims are a lot more extremist than our balkan muslims . 
  because they 're local muslims who 've lived there hundreds of years , and are most likely secular . 
  they 're not middle eastern muslims . 
  this has been tried before in bulgaria and has sadly failed . 
  hate-speech laws ? 
  is this soviet sweden ? 
  why is there even such a thing as hate-speech laws ? 
  shut down all mosques for the time being and deny muslim immigration , the statistics about `` normal muslims '' are very worrying : http://regated.com/2016/06/muslims-agree-murdering-others-perfectly-fine/ http://www.atheoryofus.net/islam-statistics/, 
  http://regated.com/2016/06/muslims-agree-murdering-others-perfectly-fine/ there are statistics too : http://www.atheoryofus.net/islam-statistics/, 
  sure , i guess they 're muslim as much as we 're christian , which is not a whole lot . 
  the fact is that the muslim population in the middle east is not like the turks . 
  nope . 
  just that our muslims are n't really muslims . 
  turks here eat pork and drink alcohol . 
  they 're secular , thanks to ataturk . 
  our muslims are turks , they 're local muslims who 've lived here for hundreds of years . 
  a lot like russia 's muslims . 
  say it with me , people : ** religion of ... **, 
   if someone wants to become bulgarian , i say let them nonononononononono . 
  people from syria are not bulgarian . 
  turks are not bulgarian . 
  ever notice how all bulgarians look a little different ? 
  i classify it like this : asiatic looking bulgarians - mainly descendant from proto-bulgarians white bulgarians - mainly from slavs dark bulgarians - mainly from thracians and turks, 
  deport them to a muslim country where they execute atheists , gays and wearing a hijab is mandatory . 
  like iran or saudi arabia . 
  brainwashing during the yugoslav times has led them to believe they 're not bulgarians , they do n't speak a dialect of bulgarian and are descendants of alexander the great . 
  most do n't like the idea . 
   we often hear , that gypsies steal children , but these accusations are false , because the gypsies have enough children of their own . 
  i love it . 
  the whole thing still rings true 100 years later . 
  ** edit : ** oh shit lads . 
  op got removed , the racist xenophobe . 
  probably serves him right for trying to spread hate towards the rich and prosperous roma, 
  how do hungarians feel about the migrants ? 
  there 'll always be a little hate over the 500 years slavery , and turks living here will always be reminded of it , but we get along mostly . 
  turks are civilized , unlike gypsies . 
  saying that , my best friend is a turk . 
  next to join bulgaria . 
  someone eli5 open source and why this is important ? 
   bulgarian cultural specifics are a spontaneous creation stopped reading . 
  austrians have their own history , spanning almost 1000 years , tradition and dialect etc. 
  macedonia and bulgaria should be one nation , yes . 
  macedonia does not have it 's own language , history , traditions . 
  however , brainwashing during yugoslav times forbids this . 
  language and history are not a basis ' for identity ? 
  do you hear yourself ? 
  how do you come to this conclusion ? 
   identity ? 
  the barely 200 year old one ? 
  bulgarians have existed for over 1300 years . 
  you 've not done your research . 
   history ? 
  you have a common history with the turks . 
  false . 
  what you 're doing is disrespecting one of the oldest countries in europe 's history now . 
   culture is again , subject to interpretation - i bet many local cultural distinctions on bulgaria 's borders are more similar to their neighbour 's culture , than `` their own '' . 
  bulgarian culture has roots in slavic , old bulgar and a little bit or turk culture .
