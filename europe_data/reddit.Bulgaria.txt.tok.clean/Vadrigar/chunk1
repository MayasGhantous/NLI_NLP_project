romanians are the true winners of the world wars in europe . 
  just look at their territory before and after . 
  it is decided then . 
  we send all the refugees to romania . 
  \u0425\u0430\u0445\u0430 welcome to bulgaria . 
  where 200 eur is the minimum monthly salary . 
  hoho, 
  why would it be fake ? 
  these people are n't stupid . 
  they want to go in only select countries because `` refugees '' before them have already gone there and know the rules . 
  apparently germany and sweden offer the best `` salaries '' for the `` refugees '' and allow them to bring their remaining family from syria too . 
  that 's why more than 80 % of the `` refugees '' are men . 
  they make the hard trip , get asylum and bring their remaining family via plane . 
  they also know of the dublin treaty and do n't want to be registered in any country but germany and sweden even though the dublin treaty is now a joke . 
  one less hurdle for them i guess . 
  expect wave 2 next summer . 
  the germans must be literally brainwashed with guilt for ww2 in order not to see how destructive merkel 's policy ( lack of ) has been to all of europe !, 
  and that 's one of the things why we 're the poorest and most corrupt country in the eu !, 
  people are waiting for a savior - every 4-5 years we 're looking for a new one and we 're surprised when he does n't `` save '' us . 
  this time it 's going to be a stupid tv show host . 
  ca n't believe this many people fall for trifonov 's bullshit . 
  this is just a pr stunt which will change nothing . 
  sole purpose is to gauge the interest in his unannounced political `` project '' ... 
  yeah they surely did n't rush it . 
  announcing it 3 days later and all they had is some bullshit guidelines to women ... 
   both were released because the police did n't know where to put them . 
  what ? 
  is germany a failed state ? 
  every summer thousands ( maybe millions ) of german turks drive back to turkey through bulgaria . 
  they drive recklessly ( even for bulgarian standards ) in packs ; stop to rest in certain places where they form huge camps and leave heaps of trash behind . 
  most of them are driving nice new cars but wear typical muslim clothes . 
  if you ca n't integrate `` moderate '' muslims like the turks for so many years , how the hell do you expect to integrate millions of arabs ? 
  the refugees for population growth argument is absurd . 
  it 's funny to me how germans still deny that ** they ** brought the current crisis to the eu . 
  everyone in the world knows what brought the masses to europe . 
  germany is still in denial ... 
  yeah i actually get stuff delivered from the uk for cheaper than local companies deliver within fucking sofia !, 
  gabco.org is the shit !, 
  are you seriously that naive ? 
  bsp is the direct descendant of bkp ( the communist party ) . 
  bsp , dps , ataka , vmro are all paid by russia . 
  they just attract different kind of voters . 
  ninova and parvanov personally visited moscow , where radev was chosen to be the presidential candidate . 
  fucking rednecks scam money out of eu funds , buy bmws and then talk against refugees and praise putin . 
  fucking retarded pieces of shit bite the hand that feeds them and will be incredibly surprised when the eu funds are cut and probably blame the eu again . 
  seriously the eu needs a propaganda machine . 
  the majority of bulgarians are too stupid . 
  we have a winner !, 
  that is the reason , why russia so easily buys politicians . 
  this deal for example was supposed to be 30 million with vat . 
  they cancelled the public auction for some reason and signed the contract with the same company but for 42 million without vat !, 
  and this is supposed to be the pro-western government right now ... gg, 
  if by nobody you mean 80 % of people over 60 and a surprising amount of young people who do n't remember communism ... 
  sadly this will continue to happen , because we keep teaching our children that russia `` freed '' us from the turks , then they `` freed '' us from the nazis . 
  both times russia is an occupator , who stole all our gold and implemented puppet governments . 
  incredibly disappointed at the bulgarian sheeple who buy russia 's propaganda so easily ... 
  that 's native ottoman attire , you western infidel pig !, 
  do n't you dare make fun of the sultan !, 
  the latest one was in 1999 , right ? 
  :d sorry but you set it up . 
  montenegro is no longer in serbia , friend . 
  my comment was as relevant as yours about ussr . 
  lol says the country who currently has a russian military exercise ( slavic brotherhood :d ) on its territory ... 
  the better part of eastern europe and germany . 
  i can tell you what they 're getting - lots of russian gas and money . 
  irish gypsies ? 
  that surprised me a lot . 
  lithuania 's number is bigger than bulgaria 's . 
  why is that ? 
  i thought there are no gypsies in lithuania . 
  what crime niche are lithuanians taking ? 
  another funny fact - grozny ( \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0435\u043d , \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430 , \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438 ) means ugly in bulgarian . 
  [ the project was stopped way ] ( http://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/barroso-warns-bulgaria-on-south-stream/ ) before the official confirmation by putin . 
  officially the eu wanted terms that they knew gazprom would never agree upon . 
  unofficially the project was stopped after the pro-russian bulgarian government was replaced by a pro-west government in the beginning of 2014 . 
  believe what you will , but there 's no logic that russia would abandon a highly profitable project which together with n.stream would allow them to totally bypass ukraine . 
  besides the bulgarian part of the construction would have probably been free for gazprom , because of all the corruption here . 
  [ lastly like i said the pipes were built and shipped to bulgaria ] ( https://alterinformation.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/5e_f5lhy4.jpg?w=489&amp;h=325 ) . 
  who does that and just abandons the project ... 
  russia did n't cancel south stream . 
  bulgaria cancelled south stream by order of the eu , by order of germany , by order of the us . 
  edit : the pipes are still sitting in varna harbour , waiting to be used in turk stream . 
  what ? 
  i 'm sure turkstream will happen , but how does that have anything to do with the eu ? 
  edit : germany does n't hate southern europe . 
  south stream was stopped by order of the us so that russia ca n't exclude ukraine from delivering gas to s.europe . 
  i 'm sure the us are n't big fans of nord streams too , but germany does n't care , because the money is too good . 
  why is everything a machete now ? 
  that was clearly a hatchet . 
  these militias are mostly harmless and honestly better than the corrupt border police who get paid by people smugglers . 
  why not aleppo or mosul ? 
  always warm , multi-cultural , currently exhibits the latest military technology from around the world . 
  have fun !, 
  south stream is bad , but doubling nord stream ** and ** nord stream 2 is perfectly fine . 
  hypocritical much , germany ? 
  or rather that sweet russian gas money is too hard to resist ... 
  and yet orban continues to suck putin 's dick any chance he gets . 
  history is meaningless when money is involved . 
  well at least with the west you get an economy . 
  i know that siemens has/had production/consulting facilities in greece .
