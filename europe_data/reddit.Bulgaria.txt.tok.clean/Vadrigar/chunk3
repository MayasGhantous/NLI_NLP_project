  it would be absolutely devastating if this coup fails or leads to a turkish civil war . 
  [ sources ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_macedonia#kingdoms_of_serbia_and_yugoslavia ) following the two balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 and the dissolution of the ottoman empire , most of its european-held territories were divided between greece , bulgaria and serbia . 
  [ 57 ] the territory of the modern macedonian state was annexed by serbia and named ju\u017ena srbija , `` southern serbia '' . 
  ** following the partition , an anti-bulgarian campaign was carried out in the areas under serbian and greek control . 
  [ 58 ] as many as 641 bulgarian schools and 761 churches were closed by the serbs , while exarchist clergy and teachers were expelled . 
  [ 58 ] the use of bulgarian ( including all macedonian dialects ) was proscribed . 
  i was replying to his snarky `` threats '' to the eu . 
  i was n't talking neither about irish borders , nor northern ireland . 
  besides ireland is n't in the shengen area , i 'm pretty sure they can do whatever they want with their borders . 
  my point was that countries that have greatly benefited from the eu ( ireland , the czech republic , hungary ) follow the brexit narrative . 
  this is just one of the many cases that are regularly on bulgarian tv - defiled bulgarian graves , banned celebrations and what not . 
  some of them might be criminals , some are caused intentionally by bulgarian ultra nationalist retards , but there are real ones . 
  you know it 's right . 
  serbian propaganda was strong , but it 's virtually impossible to not have a bulgarian minority without active suppression . 
  after the serbian de-bulgarisation of macedonia we might have been invaders , even though despite all your experience you 're not very good in ethnic cleansing are you ? 
  so i 'm sure there were a lot of bulgarians who saw the `` nazi '' ( lol ) bulgarian army as liberators . 
  that 's all besides the point , which you find hard to grasp . 
  so let me spell it out for you - you do n't bite the hand that feeds you . 
  if you hate bulgaria , do n't come here for education and work . 
  even coming from an ex-communist country you have a very weird democracy really . 
  regarding the arrests , just off the first page of google : [ link1 ] ( http://btvnovinite.bg/article/svetut/obiski-i-arest-za-shestima-makedontsi-s-balgarsko-grazhdanstvo-v-strumitsa.html ) [ link2 ] ( http://www.dw.com/bg/%d0%b4%d0%b0-%d1%81%d0%b8-%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%bb%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bd-%d0%b2-%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f/a-5540709 ) we have no disagreements . 
  like i said every bulgarian government in the last 25 years lends our ass to fyrom . 
  you have a disagreement with history and i 'd love to visit ohrid , but i wo n't because i do n't want to spend a cent in fyrom . 
   i 'm just saying no matter what the eu decide , we wo n't allow a border to go up across our island . 
  you 're the eu smarty . 
   if you ignore us , we will ignore the ruling . 
  this sounds like a children 's tantrum . 
  hopefully your politicians are better than that , but that 's not how contracts work . 
  so you 're going to get out of the eu too ? 
  lol you 're delusional if you think that the recent growth of ireland 's economy was anything but because of the free access to the huge eu market . 
  oh you 're perfectly fine being a tax evasion haven for huge corporations . 
  good luck with that . 
  what 's even funnier is that they also stole medieval bulgarian history ( tsar samuil and clement of ohrid ) and some 19th century bulgarian freedom fighters ( gotse delchev , dame gruev ) . 
  so they 're ancient macedonians , medieval bulgarians and imro actually fought to restore ancient macedonia . 
  in between they also colonized egypt and the moon . 
  it would have been funny if they did n't actually teach children this bullshit . 
  sad . 
  and i though only the us can be so ignorant . 
  lol !, 
  and there you have it folks - classic modern `` macedons '' . 
  fun fact : cleopatra was a macedonian as well !, 
  good job , romania !, 
  economic results show how bad corruption is for the economy . 
  some years ago bulgaria and romania were equal , but look at you now - romania is way ahead !, 
  you should build statues of the prosecutors/judges that made this happen . 
  not a single politician has been convicted in bulgaria ... and the justice system is the most corrupt place of them all !, 
  mangal comes from [ this ] ( https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b3%d0%b0%d0%bb ) . 
  it 's something like a bbq that was used in the past . 
  gypsies are called that because it 's black . 
  nothing to do with the mongols . 
  meanwhile bulgaria is almost the least happy country in europe at 105th place , just above sierra leone . 
  fuck you albania for taking even that achievement from us !, 
  average penis size according to cropedia : croatia - 32 cm flaccid rest of eu - < 10 cm, 
   `` it would n't be fair to the people of scotland to ask them to make a crucial decision without all the necessary information ... '' oh the irony ... 
  so dark blue - full speed europe , blue - second class europe , light blue - third world countries ? 
  kinda surprising seeing this so early from the ecfr . 
  looks like things are decided ... 
  our spineless politicians have been sucking on erdo 's dick any chance they have - handling over political refugees without question . 
  with the state of our military ... things will go very bad very quickly if something happens . 
  if i were you i 'd rig the danube bridges . 
  have you been living in a cave ? 
  there 's war in ukraine . 
  there 's a russian `` republic '' in moldova . 
  have you heard of cyprus ? 
  turkey has made constant threats to greece and with the way things are going nothing stops them from going beyond that . 
  erdogan has called part of bulgaria rightful ottoman territory . 
  there are almost a million turks in bulgaria just waiting for jihad ... 
  things are fucking peachy . 
  i think they should be more . 
  [ here 's ] ( https://www.mod.bg/bg/tema_missionsoperations.html ) a map of foreign operations of bg army . 
  orange are still active . 
  read this in bulgarian media , but could n't find a more credible english source . 
   `` putin just wants these territories to be demilitarized again , '' le pen stressed . 
  this is quite frightening . 
  french people please !, 
  i like your optimism , but it sounds too good to be true . 
  erdogan holds all the power as it is - puppet pm , puppet parliament , puppet judges , puppet media , puppet army , puppet police . 
  all the referendum will do is legitimize his power . 
  if it does n't succeed things will just continue like they are now . 
  only thing that will bring down erdo is a huge economic crash , which is still years away . 
  it might be sooner if the eu isolate him . 
  edit : forgot to mention that it 'll probably be a puppet referendum too . 
  that 's the first thing dictators do - take control of the election process . 
  is ok , prime ruski tourists are back this year . 
  all hail supreme leaders putin and erdogan and their divine alliance !, 
  they just restored the street . 
  it 's probably the most expensive commercial street in sofia . 
  lower your expectations . 
  [ vitosha boulevard ] ( https://www.google.com/maps/@42.6908572,23.3195135,3a,75y,192.55h,80.38t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skj89ymtxch9lrtil8j7jsw!2e0!3e2!7i13312!8i6656 ) named after the vitosha mountain seen here . 
  because bulgaria has the biggest natural decrease of population in europe . 
  and the statistics are counting gypsies which have a median of 5 children or something like that . 
  ethnic bulgarians are dying off / immigrating . 
  hey at least you have a nice square with statues . 
  as in every war . 
  we win the battles -  lose the wars . 
  they got fucked as in every war . 
  it is actually nothing in these times . 
  it 's most popular from bulgaria , not in .

  oh the bulgarian is rusev .
