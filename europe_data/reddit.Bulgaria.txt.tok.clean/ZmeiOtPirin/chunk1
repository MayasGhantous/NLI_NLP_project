yeah . 
  haha , i was n't quite sure of the way they spoke so i checked [ it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg1fbk7dnae ) . 
  it 's hilarious how different they sound , 
  actually most slavic languages seem to have similar words for ` sour ' . 
  you can check them easily with google translate . 
  kisel also meaning sauce is probably a homophone . 
   do you claim they speak bulgarian just to piss them off or is it really identical . 
  macedonian is incredibly similar . 
  hell , there are some bulgarian dialects that i understand less than macedonian . 
  bulgarian yogurt is famous for the bacteria , lactobacillus bulgaricus , that it contains . 
  not many people know this but after the fall of socialism in 1989 bulgaria was opened to foreign markets and consequently the demand for bulgarian yogurt skyrocketed . 
  the government adopted a national strategy to promote the production of yogurt and growing the all too important lactobacillus bulgaricus . 
  grandmas cooked it at their homes , schools had competitions for who can produce the most in a day and even going to church was replaced with making yogurt . 
  bulgaria came to dominate the yogurt market , way ahead of imposters like greece . 
  anyone could buy tonnes of dirt cheap kiselo mlyako ( bg yogurt ) . 
  but lactobacillus bulgaricus kept on growing and soon bulgarians themselves did n't know what to do with all their yogurt . 
  everyone ate it for breakfast , lunch and dinner but there was still more and more of it . 
  because of its skin caring properties people started taking yogurt baths , and having yogurt weddings where the marrying couple had to swim through yogurt to prove their devotion to each other . 
  when the winters were warm we covered our ski resorts with it in stead of snow and the prime minister declared every day was eat-a-tonne-of-yogurt-day !, 
  by the time bulgaria was ready to join the eu in 2007 all of the land was covered with yogurt . 
  i know this because i am part of the bacterial culture of yogurt , gained sentience . 
  so this is , in fact , why bulgaria is a yogurt . 
   here 's a map never realised the bulgarian coast was this straight !, 
  true , i 'm just pointing out it it 's easy for the imf to advocate debt relief when they themselves wo n't be part of it . 
  why is the imf getting praised so much ? 
  they are the ones calling for the most drastic cuts in pensions/salaries and an unrealistically high budget surplus while the ec is content with much less austerity . 
  and while they advocate debt relief by that they mean for europe to forgive some of the debt not the imf . 
  thought the uk would be richer . 
  imo , fast-tracking something that 's not happening still wo n't make it happen . 
  i 've read that erdogan does n't care much for joining the eu , but he included it in the negotiations so he could silence the critics at home . 
  `` see guys the eu still thinks were democratic enough to join in the future ! '', 
  [ pros of living in bulgaria ] ( http://solutiondots.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/defaulttemplate.png ) seriously though , ** pros : ** would be the brilliant nature , one of the fastest internet speeds in the world and the quite high home ownership rate ** cons : ** abject poverty and corrupted government, 
  [ at least things are looking up in iraf ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjke1axj0tu ), 
  entertained and a bit scared for america . 
  but i do n't think his presidency would change anything for europe . 
  i find that hard to believe . 
  [ look ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-budget ) at the budget deficits they 've been running . 
  would n't they need the bailout money to cover that ? 
  any scandinavian country . 
  well it 's not like anyone made a study about what exactly leavers think will happen to the economy but i think it 's safe to assume `` the long run '' is sometime after britain finishes leaving and already has new trade deals with several countries . 
   wait , if this is so obvious then what possible argument do nay-sayers have ? 
  they believe that britain exiting and opening itself up will lead to more growth not less in the long run . 
  this is the title the article used so no editorialization there . 
  i 'm not sure how the part about `` after 15 years '' should be read , whether it 's # 66bn loss every year during these 15 years or whether after 15 years the loss will have grown to up to # 66bn per year , but in both cases it 's significant . 
  maybe , but for me brussels in belarus just sounded so right , you know ? 
  thankfully , now i know better . 
  me too . 
  and r/europe has done wonders for my geography . 
  give me an empty map of europe and i can place every country on it , where as before my geographical knowledge was so bad i thought brussels was in belarus :3, 
  us too . 
  but because of all the record yields wheat prices have taken a nosedive . 
  holy moly , $ 1,13 !, 
  forget euro parity , at this rate we 'll have zloty parity . 
  the data for bulgaria is way off . 
   the reason for this flurry in activity can be gleaned from microsoft chief executive satya nadella 's tour of europe , where he took the opportunity to announce something else , too : a book published by the redmond giant titled `` a cloud for global good , '' which includes dozens of detailed policy recommendations , with a sharp focus on privacy . 
  i do n't believe my eyes . 
  this sounds pretty good if it 's true . 
   too bad so many voted for him , despite all of this . 
  that 's bad of them indeed but i do n't think any nation deserves erdogan . 
  a bad economy is said to be the only thing that could topple erdogan . 
  poor turks though , their country 's descent into authoritarianism is terrifying . 
  looks real nice , 
  guys i really hoped you would join me in being supportive of our new member . 
  send your good thoughts here https://www.reddit.com/r/mexico/comments/54saqe/muchas_felicidades_por_unirse_a_la_ue/, 
  we 'll we kinda are . 
  we were 6,1 k apart in 2008 and we 're 3,5 k apart now . 
  not as impressive as romania but still chugging along . 
  btw , congrats romania on your growth !, 
   the us has a lot of advantages that other countries do n't have . 
  it has unrivaled cultural influence , is protected by two massive oceans , is situated in an almost entirely peaceful hemisphere , has strong allies , a constant influx of immigrants who integrate well , a constantly battle-hardened armed forces , the world 's third largest population , etc. 
  just wait till president trump is done with that . 
  it killed it in the making , or at least eu efforts on it . 
  i think the official positions of countries like germany were extremely understanding towards the uk . 
  but now of course things will get bitter when the uk is blocking eu 's army or an international inquiry . 
  it 's a needless attempt to piss other countries off . 
  these kind of things do n't concern the uk , i very much doubt the eu wants or could force the uk to participate in a shared army , so why ruin it for the rest of the eu ? 
  while we 're on the divorce metaphor , the uk is basically painting the family house black before leaving it and still thinks its partner should keep it cool and give the uk favourable terms . 
  british . 
  cake . 
  the uk really wants a nasty divorce , does n't it ? 
  while the peg can theoretically be removed , this seems very unlikely . 
  it 's a popular measure and for it to be removed there would need to be a recession that lasts long enough for the peg removal to be considered and gain support . 
  a long recession just is n't likely for a developing country like bulgaria which also get eurofunds . 
  borisov has said conflicting things many times . 
  as recently as last month [ he said it would be good for bulgaria to join erm 2 ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2016/08/28/2818412_boiko_borisov_shengen_v_momenta_ne_e_izgoden_za/ ) and [ he asked merkel about it . 
  ] ( http://www.dnes.bg/politika/2016/08/28/borisov-poiska-shengen-i-evrozona-za-bylgariia.313814 ) of course even if country has been in erm 2 for 2 years it does n't have to join the eurozone but it is much closer to doing that . 
  by that time we will see how the current ez problems develop and can decide based on that . 
   the question is `` what do we gain if we join ? '', 
   the answer is not that much . 
  some bank transfer taxes revoked , lower interest rates on eu loans etc. 
  lower interest on all sorts of credit i think , including our national debt . 
  and we 'll safe a little bit on exchanging levs for euros which will be good for trade . 
  tourism will profit too since most eu nationals wo n't need to buy levs . 
  if we were romania or poland i 'd be way more cautious about this , but since our currency is pegged we 're already subject to most negative aspects of the euro . 
  we ca n't devalue , we ca n't control the interest rate and if the euro does n't survive the next years we 're just as fucked . 
  as for borisov i would n't take him very seriously on this . 
  he 's flip-flopped a lot and it just sounds like they told him `` no '' so now he 's like `` fine , we never wanted to be in the eurozone anyways ! '', 
  i know right ? 
  someone should tell the rest of the world that when they 're in a recession they should just spend more money and not be in the eurozone . 
  global prosperity ensured !,
