  2014 - 2,9 bln to greece . 
  a small decrease but considering exports to other countries like germany almost doubled , it 's a huge loss of potential . 
  greece was the biggest importer in 2008 . 
  in 2014 they 're the fifth . 
  `` as a matter of fact bulgaria is now profiting from trade with greece which they did n't do previously '' if by that you mean a trade surplus , we 've had one with greece in 2005 , 2007 , 2008 , 2009 , 2010 , 2011 , 2013 , 2014 and 2015 . 
  another lie . 
  `` in addition to that it is a fact that at least 20000 jobs are expected to be created by greek companies moving to bulgaria in the almost immediately '' 20 000 expected based on faulty data and there 's no reason to believe those expectations came true . 
  can you give any actual numbers since the financial crisis ? 
  `` and companies that moved from greece to bulgaria have already created 60000-80000 jobs . '', 
  in the last 20 years . 
  aka the period when greece was doing mostly good . 
  `` in addition to that investment from greek companies have increased significantly '' lol , an unsupported lie . 
  `` and other sectors such as tourism have benefited greatly from greece doing badly . '', 
  did you even look at the bloody graphic ?!, 
  greece is getting more tourists than ever . 
  they 're not doing badly by any stretch of the imagination . 
  `` you just keep ignoring facts and are making claims that are simply false f.e about trade . '', 
  i showed you the stats . 
  here they are again : www.nsi.bg/sites/default/files/files/data/timeseries/ftrade_1.1.2.2.xls \u0418\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441 - export , \u0412\u043d\u043e\u0441 - import , \u0413\u044a\u0440\u0446\u0438\u044f - greece the dip in trade is indeed small but compared to the big growth experienced with other countries greece has become much less relevant . 
  a consequence of them getting poorer . 
  a loss of potential . 
   which is why i just skimmed through your comment after the first paragraph because there is no point in talkink to someone who is just denying facts . 
  well then stop skimming trough my comment because i did n't ignore anything , i actually expanded on `` the jobs '' . 
  the number of moving companies was exaggerated greatly and 80 % of them employ noone . 
  the only article that you quoted and gives an actual number of jobs created talks about a period of 20 years , not the last few . 
  and i acknowledged those jobs , but my point was they 're not enough to account for lost trade . 
  if you ca n't be bothered to read a comment because you think it denies facts even before having read what the comment says , why are you even on reddit ? 
  also what are these `` multiple important factors '' aside from said jobs ? 
  the links you provided almost exclusively talk about companies moving to bg . 
  this is a story that has gotten a lot of attention in our media and obviously a decent amount abroad . 
  last year particularly everyone was talking about how 60 000 companies have supposedly moved here . 
  but it turned out this simply was n't true . 
  according to our own statistics institute and i think the greek one too they were just 5 000 . https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fpetel.bg%2f15-000-gratski-firmi-rabotyat-v-balgariya-__142293&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url . 
  also as i said most of them are n't really doing anything . 
  up to 2013 there were 11 000 greek firms here . 
  6 000 of them reported 0 turnover . 
  9 000 employed no staff ... https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fclubz.bg%2f38291-grycki_firmi_masovo_idvat_v_bylgariq___vqrno_ili_nevqrno&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url . 
  is this really proping up our economy ? 
  during 2013 there were 360 000 companies in bg . 
  16 000 greek ones do n't make that much of a difference . 
  as you can see greek business moving to bulgaria has been grossly exaggerated . 
  i 'm sure they 've contributed some , but does it offset us losing a strong greek economy as our partner ? 
  in 2007 greece was the fourth biggest import of bulgarian goods , in 2008 - first . 
  ( you can download this info here : www.nsi.bg/sites/default/files/files/data/timeseries/ftrade_1.1.2.2.xls \u0418\u0437\u043d\u043e\u0441 - export , \u0412\u043d\u043e\u0441 - import , \u0413\u044a\u0440\u0446\u0438\u044f - greece ) . 
  obviously they being in a crisis comparable to the great depression is gon na affect that !, 
  while greece is still importing a lot , they 're fifth , the total volume is now farm from that of germany , turkey , romania , italy . 
  and as i said they used to be one of the biggest investors in bulgaria . 
  not anymore . 
  one of your articles also talks about bulgaria siphoning tourists from our southern neighbor in 2012 based on a 3 % drop in germans , but almost every year after 2010 tourism in greece has had a good growth : http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/tourist-arrivals if anything wages falling should allow for a cheaper deal for foreign tourists and boost that sector . 
  bulgaria would have a harder time competing . 
  the only exception seems to be this year when indeed the migrant crisis has made people wary of travelling there . 
  but greece is still expecting an increase just not as much as bulgaria . 
  yes , i 'm sure one of your biggest trading and investment partners losing 25 % of their gdp was good for the bulgarian economy . 
  / s most of the greek companies that moved to bulgaria did so to evade the capital controls and high taxation , but their activity is still focused on greece, 
  so you 're saying we were after the wrong macedonia all this time ? 
  eh , that 's a given . 
  but we 've improved lots from last year . 
  in the world ranking we 've climbed 6 places !, 
  as i understand it the us can just print as much money as it needs to account for all their imbalances . 
  the important thing here is that unlike just about every other country on earth , the us is n't really risking hyperinflation by doing so . 
  this is because a huge part of the existing dollar supply is n't used by america itself . 
  countries use dollars to pay for the oil they import , entire economies run on dollars in stead of the local currency which was deemed too unstable , like zimbabwe for example , and every central bank has a big reserve of $ $ $ . 
  so when more dollars are printed part of the resulting inflation is ` absorbed ' by all these other countries having dollars in stead of the us economy . 
  this puts america in a very unique position of not having to worry about its debt or trade deficit . 
  it also helps you understand their foreign policy of meddling everytime countries want to sell their oil in something other than us dollars . 
  it 's quite genius even if somewhat sinister . 
  of course germany would have such a map ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  would be nice to see this adjusted for population growth . 
  for example while germany 's growth was lower than that of sweden and the uk , per capita they improved noticeably more than them . 
  71 eu citizens died today because of traffic accidents and 285 were permanently disabled but i guess since they did n't die from terrorists they do n't matter . 
  now who 's up for giving up more rights to stop terrorism !, 
  some chapters were opened but overall it looks like he duped the eu . 
  i do n't imagine he aims to both join the eu and get more power as these are incompatible goals . 
   the problem is 2 fold . 
  the eu is not mutually beneficial for serbia . 
  in hard economic terms the eu will be bad . 
   thus like other eastern european countries like slovenia , croatia , poland , hungry , bulgaria ( i can list examples if you really want them ) ... the profit will be syphoned and the economy will begun to be fuelled with debt . 
  and yet all of those countries have higher living standards . 
  i do n't know how to argue something so painfully obvious to me , you look at a map of europe and you 'll see that the eastern european countries who joined the eu are doing much better than the ones who did n't . 
  as for the debt , estonia , lithuania , bulgaria , romania , latvia all have very little debt , between 10 % and 40 % . 
  serbia which is n't in the eu has 73 % , which is more than slovakia , poland and czechia too . 
  you said that slovenia had 21 % debt to gdp in 2008 , but that 's 4 years after they joined !, 
  the debt increase was surely because of the global economic crisis . 
  i doubt the eu cares as much about kosovo as it does about serbia . 
  and you never know , maybe the eu learned its lesson from supporting a different dictator , erdogan . 
  the eu does n't want serbia to fall into russia 's sphere though . 
  vucic is pro-eu and has the support of 50 % of the people . 
  the opposition is anti-eu and pro-russia . 
  sadly , it makes sense to support vucic , hopefully a different party gets major support while being pro-eu . 
  best case scenario would be if the eu actually stuck to its democratic values . 
  man , this is so sad . 
  why is authoritarianism growing everywhere ? 
  i wish all the best to the people of serbia . 
  imo what needs to happen to topple vucic is for serbians to keep protesting all the time and for the eu to start criticising vucic often . 
  though i suspect even if the eu does your media wo n't report on it . 
  `` slams '' this clown has completely destroyed his credibility . 
  not that there are n't bulgarians who are extremely negative on our country but if they commented mostly on russian videos there 's a good chance they 're fake accounts . 
  it 's a bit disturbing to me that we live in times like this , when the people you talk to online might be payed to say the things that they say . 
  ditto for bulgaria . 
  yeah and all that job creation that was fake under obama is suddenly very real and tremendous .
