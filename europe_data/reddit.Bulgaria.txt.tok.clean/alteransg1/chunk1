  so they bombed serbia to put kosovo on the map , and they are n't even going to put it on the map . 
  now that 's just wrong !, 
  eur 50 000 a month ? 
  in some eastern european countires you 'll have to work 7-10 years to get that ... 
  remember , last year when the bulgarian court found a bunch of immigrant imams gulty of spreading radical islam . 
  all the foreighn media outlets went into the usual ape shit human rights mode . 
  looking back those people were almost certainly recruiting for is . 
  you know what the funniest thing is ? 
  the imams in question were n't turned in by the nationalists or the right wing ers , but by the local imams . 
  well done !, 
  about time people started recognising scientology and some other american `` religions '' for the financial power/mob structures that they are . 
  this is just fearmongering . 
  mr. siderov is a buffon who rode a nationalist wave into parlament . 
  considering that : * his party split into two whereby the more conservative nationalists got fed up and denounced siderov 's radical views . 
  * the party made a coalition with the ethnic mrf * mr. siderov has been indited under criminal charges for asaulting a police officer . 
  there are different charges for asaulting a journalist as well as a few international incidents and the speculations of misapropriation of the alowed state funds for the party . 
  the odds of mr. siderov and ataka ever agian gaining that 7.3 % on the parlamentary are unlikely . 
  in fact crossing the 4 % threshold will be a challenge . 
  him toppling the government makes for mildly amusing fanfiction . 
   you would n't seriously choose russia over america though actually after ww2 the usa has on multiple occasions screwed over bulgaria . 
  * 50s to early 90s bg , despite being part of comecon was labeled a third world country meaning trade was limited to only two us ports and and heavily taxed . 
  * after the 76 ' crysis , as a part of the recovery plan , bulgaria encouraged trade relations with lybia , iraq and iran , providing weapons , civilian contractors , logistics , agricultural products and livestock . 
  this resulted in all three countries acruing massive ammounts of debt . 
  libya owed 200 mil . 
  in 1998 they made up a completely bogus trial and acused six bulgarian nurses and a doctor for purposefully infecting children with hiv , threathening a death sentence . 
  they ended up getting the debt pardoned and well as extoriting almost half a billion from the eu . 
  bulgaria was eadlocked politically because of gadaffi 's newfound western friends . 
  iraq - 3 billion debt , but once they got `` liberated '' from the us , all bulgaria got was 250 million and a shitty deployment mission . 
  the only ones who paid back in full were the iranians . 
  just last some dea agent looking to make a carier issued an extradition warrant for a bulgarian woman on the grounds of large scale money laundering and trafficking perscription medicine . 
  as it turns out , the company she was working in as an accountant was a front for a certain british `` businessman '' and his bulgarian counterpart . 
  the woman was just a clerk who handled financial records of what appeared to be a simple transport company and had neither control acces to the firm 's accounts , nor any detailed knowlege of the operation . 
  this is information that could have easily been made available to said dea agent in a few days . 
  if he had gone after the owners of the firm , it is possible that the bulgarian would have gone to ground and the british - gotten a slap on the wrist in the uk . 
  so instead he decided to blame a mother of two who was much less likely to evade capture and or have political/mafia ties . 
  the usa has abysmal healthcare an appaling public education system . 
  also there are some serious grounds for calling it a police state ( has n't sighned uncrc , cedaw and a number of other human rights treaties , the convention against enforced disappearance , the convention on cluster munitions ; multiple cases of police brutality during riots , racial profiling , abuse of privacy and multiple accounts of extraordinary rendition ) . 
  so to answer your question , yes , there are people , normal educated and pollitically unafilliated people , who would choose to align themselves with russia . 
  yes , russia has its problems too , but you should seriously reevaluate your belief that other countries in the world view the us as some sort of utopia . 
  you should also stop taliking and comparing countries you know nothing about . 
  ha , if only all bulgarians were so adamant and vocal . 
  i 'm sick and tired of hearing people defend another country 's actions and claim patriotism at the same time . 
  you 'll never hear a texan talk bout how good mexicans are for the economy ... 
  actually some people did try and outlaw the practice , but apparently that would be infringing on their cultural heritage ... 
  in sofia there are some streets named after 19-th century corespondents from the west : januarius macgahan , james bourchier , william gladstone , eugene schuyler . 
  now , let 's see : * assassin 's creed rogue - made in bulgaria . 
  * half life 2 - viktor antonov desighned city 17 , most of it is based on his hometown of sofia . 
  * dishonored - victor antonov was visual desighn director . 
  * tzar : burden of the crown and knights of honor - rts from the early 2k-s . ok , tou probably have n't heard of those . 
  * alone in the dark 5 - the sound track was a colab with the mystery of bulgarian voices * cod : advanced warfare : `` press f to blow up bulgaria '' i think we 're doing fine , all things considered . 
  keep in mind that this data is probably based on sales and breweries dats . 
  however in bulgaria everyone homebrews wine and rakiya , even old grannies ... especially old grannies . 
  bulgarian medias ' integrity is kind of like a virgin prostitute . 
  it is known that the predominant part of the migrants are younger aged men . 
  beoynd the obvious grueling experience that is the journey , you would n't want to be the one or two or ten women among a hundred deperate men . 
  almost all immgirant women , of the few women that come , come with their husbands . 
  this also poses a challege on demographics , especially since europe is n't doing this weel in the area . 
  zumbiulcho from selemetya has moskvich 12er , an oxygen cutter and 16 kids to feed ... 
  ** context ** : a bulgarian beach was closed because the scepting sewage was too much and made the water hazardous . 
  according to volen - the official story is actually a ruse , because the resort is mostly visited and inhabited by many russians , the nato dropped chemical shit weapons to drive them out . 
  how exacltly will research change reality ? 
  charities are a void . 
  they will always need money , a lot of the times only a fraction reaches the intended targets , or worse they are bound by some insane legal rules - like that american charity that ended up buying ultra expencive billionare funriture for a school in africa , because they had a shit ton of money on a use it or loose it clause for a very specific purpose . 
  you can try and help people yourself , but you 'll only reach a miniscule number . 
  you can try and give money to charities , but that 's like a black hole , and pretty soon your money will run out . 
  if you want to really make an impact , design an immigration process . 
  one that more than half of eu countries will accept . 
  one that can filter real asylum seekers from economic immigrants . 
  one that offers viable integration solutions , based on the experiences of countries who 've handled large groups of immigrants . 
  make the eu vote and accept that project , rather than having some outrageously stupid ideas like quotas . 
  just an ignorant questio - if he was known to the security services , how the f did he aquire an ak ? 
  whoecwe broke the rhyme , did the crime . 
  `` hold on to that puppy . 
  hold that puppy for your life . '', 
  * cause baby , you 're a firewok ... 
  it 's on the official president web page . 
  actually , the western world should sto trying to be the moral arbitrar of world , especially considering they are mostly responsible for whiping out an entire race . 
  not really . 
  because of a long list of reasons , russians are buying premium bulgarian our agricultural products for cents on the euro , while our stores are filled with overpriced crap . 
  i 'm glad that is finally over . 
  that would have been a whole new level of comitment to reality tv . 
  how about jumping the shark ? 
  can he make russia a 21 c. country ? 
  yes . 
  will he ? 
  please , a commie with an original thought ... it 'd be like a dog chasing a car , once it has it , it would n't know what to do with it . 
  disaster relief happens at random intervals ( when there is a disaster ) and while it may not be a primary or even secondary concern , the providing countries do recive an economic benefit out of providing it . 
  international aid , on the other hand , in the form of a percentage of the gdp is a tool that can control and destabalise the economies of weaker countries . 
  also it 's not europe 's fault that some places are reproducing at an unsustainable rate . 
  international aid , especially in kind , destroy the economies of develouping countries . 
  besides , the corporate policies in a particular country have little to do with the country 's international policy and are much more dependant on the decions of the regional manager . 
  male , male ...
