  this guy is radical . 
  he just needs to bend over an intern and his ratings are going to skyrocket . 
  esa just needs to cut open someone 's space suit and have a bitchin power ballad soundtrack . 
  then it will have the love it deserves . 
  you can have mondays trough thursdays , and you can have the weekens , allright ? 
  i know that 's not normal , but in this crazy , crazy world is normal so good ? 
  it 's not a fake . 
  it 's an alternative truth . 
  see , he could have been at that rally !, 
  actually , the original bulgarian cyrilic script by kliment ohridski and the students of cyril and methodius was quite pretty . 
  [ you can see some examples here ] ( https://tadyava.wordpress.com/2016/03/21/%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%b5%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0-%d1%85%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b0-%d0%b8%d0%b7%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%80-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%bb%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81/ ) in the early 1700s peter i of russia ordered a standartisaion of the cyrilic scrip , known as the civil scrips . 
  a draft painting of the letters was sent to the netherlands and the first cyrilic print was created in amsterdam . 
  the prinworks in amsterdam found it far easier to reverse some leterstamps rather than create a complicated new ones for all the letters - hence `` mirrored letters '' . 
  rescue - such a cutesy , positive word , bu that does it exactly mean ? 
  they dump huge masses of people in southern european countries and call it a rescue . 
  how exactly are those people rescued ? 
  there is no sustainable plan for feeding clothing or sheltering them . 
  there is very little chance of integration - most of those people speak exotic languages , have little marketable skills and very different moral values . 
  for example the picture that is circulating facebook these days , of a danish woman feeding an african kid that is ski and bonees . 
  you know why that kid was left to starve to death ? 
  because his parents thought it was a which . 
  yes , imagine that - an evil six year old . 
  and while that base moraliry may not apply to all refugees from africa , writing a blank check that is `` rescue '' is certainly going to allow the bad people to trample over legitimate refugees . 
  hey , being able to joke about yourself is an important quality . 
  there was this anecdotal story about one of the - stan leaders : the kgb sits him down in a room and plays the recording of him with two hookers . 
  insted of being embarrased the guy is like - hell get me a copy , i want to play this on the national tv and show the people how i f * ck russian bitches . 
  true or not , point being - if and whatever the russians have on dondald `` grab er by the pussy '' trump it ai n't a sex tape . 
  yah , danube is not a river to mess around with , especially on a severe snowstorm like the one that started this night . 
  \u0414\u0435\u0439\u0431\u0430 literally means ifuck , but it most closely translates to : `` well ... shit '' . 
  to clarify , dansing in the river is specifict to one city . 
  the gneveral tradition is to toss a crusifix in the nearest body of water and have young men dive after it . 
  because of the severe weather some places will just throw it in the water tied to a rope and not have people jumping in the water . 
  for some reason , when africans and asians start to interpret the bible , they go ape shit crazy . 
  does n't look like anything to me !, 
  romanians , is moldovan kind of like macedonian ? 
  bulgaria is already divided . 
  there is the east part and the west part thst insists on calling itself macedonia . 
  aslan is a jesus metaphor ... 
  well , there is a group of people who imagined everyone joining hand and living happily together . 
  they are called communista and have murdered more people than the nazis . 
  if you 've done your investigations right , you wo n't be in for a surprise . 
  your enemy is a fire mage ans summons a fire elemental , so do n't bother with igni . 
  use aard . 
  also his blade has poson damage , so be prepared for bleeding . 
  he will also throw saumum granades , which will teporarily stun you . 
  overall , the hidden royal wyvers to the north are actually a harder fight . 
  jusp prepare well and you should survive the encounter . 
  oh , and yes , you do n't fight till the end , you just need to kill the elemental and drop their health and they will teleport the f out . 
  honestly , i support the eu commision 's decision . 
  bulgaria weasled it 's way into the eu and has done nothing to improve itself and become even remotely equaly to other members , despite the billions the eu keep giving us . 
  ( this is a fact . 
  reed the reporto on funds utilisation and econimic growth . 
  the poorest nuts regions are the best fund utilisers and there has been zero economic benefit . 
  vidin region is the starkest example . 
  but also , eu , wake the fak up - a 1000 decrepid people village does n't need a 5 million euro sports facility . 
  also , the actual facily being built is brobably not even worth 2 million . 
  also , the contractor is supposed to be a local to boost the economy - guess what , the local companies that get the contract are fronts with no actualy capabilities , they outsource the project to the big city companies owned by the mafia . 
  everyone gets a piece of the pie . ), 
  now , our new president is openly hinting at leaving nato and the eu . 
  i 'm sorry , but until people learn that the socialist nany state is over and freedom is responsibility , bulgaria is not a state worth helping . 
  offtopic , but - on a scale of one to lingual massacre , how wrong would it be so say : `` deinen ersten niemals vergessen '' ? 
  thank you !, 
  trump is thrilled that they have taken his idea to heart , but it is his idea , so they should expect to hear from his layers . 
  ugh , i ~ ~ hate ~ ~ love that movie clue . 
  your bullet points read like a rap song, 
  slavic race ( panslavisms ) is a fiction created during the reign of peter the great . 
  certainly the different groups in eastern europe had some similarities , but to claim that they were a homogenous group with some minor variations between regions is make believe . 
  trafficking is a reality in the gypcy comunities . 
  bulgarian social services are having a hard time handling non minority kids , not to mention doing trafficking on their own . 
  just recently there was a string of questionable forced alienations of children from their parents . 
  not as tense as soros 's coin purse . 
  i 've been called a sorosoid many a time and have yet to see a single penny . 
  racism in this case is meat about ethnical sub-races , but ethnicism dose n't really sound good . 
  bulgarians are like a box of chocolates . 
  you can have anything from blue eyed , blonde angels to people whose complexion can out-middle-eastern an arab . 
  facial shape and features are far more telling . 
  also , more or less the same goes for roma . 
  remember early last year when the greek police found a blue-eyed kid in a roma vamp and went ape shit because the thought it was a kidnapping . 
  well , it turned out the kid was a bulgarian gypcy , who got sold to the greek clan ... 
  reach ... 
  flexibility ... 
  actually , the bulgarian government already resigned , so ... 
  maybe , just maybe , the west is simply afraid of persecution , so they do n't actually respond as they would like . 
  the same goes the other way - just because someone would not like their daughter married to a gypcy , does n't mean they are white hat kkk lynch-mobbers . 
  define `` christian '' !, 
  only read a few pages , goes to chirch 5 times a year on the biggest celebrations christian ? 
  streetwalker jw christian ? 
  gim me all you $ $ $ cultist christian ? 
  full on the exorcits `` ze pawaaaa of christi compells ya '' christian ? 
  `` to feel like a white person '' - actual bulgarian expression . 
  pride goeth before a fall . 
  - proverbs 16:18, 
  from the 70s , with the mustaches and all . 
  culture identity issue . 
  i believe teenagers experience some form of it , but most fall back on national pride or some form collective belonging . 
  these second gen. immigrants however do n't have that . 
  they see they 'll always be treated as outsiders and their parents as weaklinga who surrendered to the evil west . 
  and then they either meet a charming preacher from the middle east , or go to prison , which in some countries has been prooven as a breding ground for terrorists . 
  this beggs the quiestion if long term integration is even possible ... 
  for honor !,
