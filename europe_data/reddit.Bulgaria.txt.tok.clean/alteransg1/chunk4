  they can , they did , it did not work . 
  i 'm prretty sure attendance is purchased . 
  at least here , a 4.5 % party that can barely muster 100 supporter on a protest , somehow managed to summon about 1.5 k when the official russian delegate ignored the government at the national day celebrations and attended the party rally . 
  at first it was n't a big deal , but for aome time now i 've become accutely aware of the constant daily bombardment with pro russian propaganda - news , fb , g + it 's everywhere in varying degrees of obviousness . 
  i 'm sorry , but i do n't really like this article . 
  first off , in the late 19th-early 20th c. we 've had female voevodi and haiduti , female fighter pilots and etc. 
  also the article glosses over some and presents in a cheapish emotional way some very complex topics like relations with the third reich , 30s increased industrialism , terrorism and complex social issues . 
  furthermore , the demographic shifts after the 50s were influenced by a number of factors . 
  boiling it down to women were n't making babies because the were in university of working and abortions were available is a gross generalisation . 
  for example in the extremely moralised communist society copulation did n't exist . 
  also , if anything , the regime reinforced gender specific roles and is one of the main reasons why society today has significant problem with gender equality and females , despite dominating the workforce are paid tangibly less . 
  popes nicholas i and adrian ii . 
  boris i was looking to adopt an official state religion and his first choise was catholicism - it would have given rome a foothold near the eastern empire and had the bulgarians taken constantinopole . 
  adrian ii was much more conservative and had his own agendaes , leaving no choise but to adopt christianity from the byzantians . 
  basically , becoming a dc agent , as it was called - it 's more like the equivalent of a an informant/asset - was something one was `` volunteered '' for . 
  not many people were eager to find out what 's behind door n2 and if they did no one really knows much about them , which is sort of self explanatory . 
  oh my god , my righteous god !, 
  not you , who are in the skies , but you , who are within me , god - me in my heart and soul ... . 
  not you , whom monks and kings worship and not to whom the orthodox cattle light candles ;, 
  i chose the wiki article , because it has the moat sussinct explanation . 
  there are many reapectalble publications covering the case . 
  ... unless there 's a smoking , lesser noble chick , who you totally want to bang , but there 's that pesky marriage to that other chick , whose nephew currently has a firm grasp on the presiding pope 's testicles . 
  the orthodox faith as a cultural phenomenon is deeply respected . 
  the church as an institue now - not so much . 
  a lot of the current priests were state security collaborators and many of them now are businessmen . 
  just another clich\u00e9 commie royalty . 
  born to rich parents , educated and living large in the west , enjoying western goods , western movies and praising something he knows nothing about . 
  i 'd like to see him wait 20 years for a car , 10 years for a tv and be able to purchase sugar once a month . 
  what exactly should i educate myself about ? 
  it 's not my problem that political correctness has turned you into cun * s. 
  well , every time those latter day saints kids approach me , i 'm like `` puny god '' , so ther 's that at least . 
  actually blame the new pope . 
  we were on the fast track for catholicism . 
  the old pope even blessed the cyrilic alphabet and had a dual language service . 
  and then the pope got a bit dead and the next one was a hater . 
  french troops go to a banana country , rape girls , get prosecuted . 
  3-rd wold coutry people go to the uk , rape girls , the police politely covers it up . 
  what he need is a war led in the shadows . 
  shadow war ? 
  well , i guess there are going be some of those smug superrior vorlons and rhe disco saucer race . 
  nokia was bought out by microsoft . 
  well , at least he was n't texting the intern , like that american president . 
  jimmy carr would be perfect . 
  i 'm starting to think the femen members are some sort of cult , like charles manson . 
  i think that all soviet monuments should stay as a reminder of the entire era . 
  forgive but do n't forget . 
  the only thing bulgaria took back from romania was south dobrudja with the treaty of craiova . 
  btw that is one of the very few war-less tranfers of land on the old continent ever . 
  s.dobrudja became romanian in 1913 , because of that one time when romania attacked us when we were fighting literally everyone on the balkans . 
  when romania entered ww1 southern dobruja was taken back with blood . 
  the dobrich and kubadin ( 18 sept.-21oct . 
  1916 ) campaigns were not glorious battles . 
  they were a bloody , scrappy fight for every meter . 
  after 1944 history largely ignored them because they are not politically correct - bugarians , germans and ( the `` archenemy '' ) the ottoman empire fighting together against the romanians and the ( `` brother '' ) russian - it does n't fit the pasty communist narrative . 
  \u0422he crushing loss of the karapelit-kochmar ( 3 sept. ) - gen. kolev led the 4th mounted brigade ( 400 strong ) from the 6th regiment ( 1th mounted division ) against the 19th romanian infantry division and russian reinforcements ( 4000 strong ) opened up the way to dobrich . 
  the strategic planning for taking turtucaia ( north front , 2-6 sept. 1916 ) was a nighmare . 
  gen kiselov and gen. feldmarshal von mackensen had furios heated arguments . 
  at the end kiselov 's plan was chosen . 
  karapelit-kochmar forced the romanian troops to leave dobrich city ( 4 sept ) and regroup with the russian and serbian support led by gen zainochovski . 
  leaving the city , the romanians kiled civilians and took hostages . 
  on the 5th the bulgarian forces held the city against the overwhelming russian , romanian and serbian troop and at night both sides received relief troops . 
  on the 6th the russians came within 200 of the varna positions . 
  the defendants counter-attacked `` fix bayonets '' . 
  to allevieate the siege the 6th division diverted the 35th vratza regiment to flank the romanian/russian troops moving towards dobrich . 
  under the cover of night some of the 35th was transfered to reinforce varna . 
  on the 7th central command expected the final confrontation to happen on the varna line . 
  gen. zaichinovski instead focused his attack on dobrich , hitting the weakened 35th hard . 
  the nearest 36th was dispatched , but the serbo-croatian forces abushed and pinned it down , leavind the 35th ... fucked . 
  without wating for orders gen. kolev led the entire 1st mounted decimating the serbo-croatian forces and saving the 36th . 
  the scattered troops who retreated to the varna front brought mayhem into the lines and the russian troops were forced to retreat north . 
  and then some faggots drew up the neuilly-sur-seine and cut up parts of the country as punishment for supporting germany . 
  actually woodrow wilson was a supporter of the self-determination and he left the conference . 
  when the border was drawn in 1919 it literally [ cut settlements in half ] ( http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9d%d1%8c%d0%be%d0%b9%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8_%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%80#/media/file:map_of_bulgaria_after_treaty_of_neuilly-sur-sein%d0%b5-bg.svg ) . 
  tl ; dr `` bulgaria had no problem taking a part of romania '' - damn right we did n't . 
  please do unify , so that my koh-i-noor could once more be geographically accurate . 
  de facto declaration of war . 
  actually , many times throughout history countries have started started wars without formally declaring it , for many reasons , non the least which is shock and awe . 
  like i said in another topic , pre 89 eastern european bikers are mostly the the e.europe version of spoiled hamptons rich people brats . 
  no , he is n't . 
  he may be many things , but stupid is n't one of them . 
  any country that starts a war without a provocation will get effed into oblivion . 
  however the last 80 years have made countries complicit and complacent . 
  had any of these events happened in the 30s , putin would already be at war with half the world . 
  he 's the one who has to make the first move and it 's far easier to lead a shadow war than straight up declare one . 
  in fact what 's the simplest definition of war - when one country sends its troops trough the border and takes a territory in another . 
  russia has done just that and they have even confirmed that the troops are theirs . 
  newsflash : russia has de facto declared war on ukraine . 
  hopefully these `` humans '' will have a run in with the booty warrior . 
  bailif ... blah , that 's the cop that presides in a courtroom . 
  it sounds quite pedestrian . 
  the people that went there were ** executor judges ** . 
  is there a more adequate translation - yes . 
  does it sound this awesome - actually it does , a little bit - magistrates ' bailiff . 
  by the 1350 bulgaria was already split between 3 rulers . 
  if fact , had it not been for the constant infighting and game of thronesianism , the black death and the consecutive bad harvests , the ottomans probably would n't have been able to pick the sates one by one . 
  [ here is a more accurate map , circa 1358 ] ( http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%98%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd_%d0%a1%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b8%d1%80#/media/file:vidin_14.jpg ), 
  dark days ahead for ~ ~ the jews of ~ ~ russia . 
  ftfy, 
  a lot of countries have ' t attended one of those , beyond an ambassador for ages . 
  suddenly they sent out invitations asking for pm and presidents .
