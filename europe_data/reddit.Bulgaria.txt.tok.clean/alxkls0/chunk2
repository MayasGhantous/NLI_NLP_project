  and thanks to my otherwise extensive experience with all kinds of people , combined with the nature of my daily job , i 've got a million and one reasons to doubt every word i see . 
  tisk tisk tisk , and some have the nerve to ask me why i like machines more than people . 
  anyway ... night night . 
  put your hand on your chest and honestly tell me if you believe any of the things you just said ? 
  i have my doubts . 
  you do realize that even if the uk leaves the eu , it will still be a case of `` evil eu immigrants '' vs `` all other non-eu immigrants '' in the face of the british media and therefore government and ( inevitably ) public for generations to come , right ? 
  the point that there are people moving to the uk despite all that is just as relevant as what the people suffering from coprophilia get excited about ( do n't google it ) . 
  edit : typo, 
   will ** likely ** become similar to the status of australians at this stage those are mere speculations but even if those turn out to be true ( which i highly doubt ) , it does n't end with one , two or even 20 bureaucratic blockers the residents might have go through . 
  i think it would . 
  perhaps unpopular opinion but i do n't think a brexit would make much of a difference for anyone other than the brits ( and sadly the eu citizens living there who will take a few hits one way or another ) . 
  frexit seems to be utterly unlikely and it will probably end up being a second version of the [ 2002 french presidential elections ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_presidential_election,_2002 ) . 
  especially given how well france and germany seem to be working as a team . 
  as for the other countries with large eurosceptic representation - i still see them as unlikely candidates . 
  austria already had a very eurosceptic counselor not that long ago , denmark seems unlikely , the netherlands - same . 
  maybe a two stage membership will happen in the future - those who have adopted the euro and those who oppose it . 
  depends how you define `` good '' . 
  i ca n't speak german but i do understand it without any effort ( 4 years in school ) . 
  and yes , i do have a lot of german friends . 
  but i guess it depends which part of germany we are talking about - my best friend ( originally from leipzig ) has said on more than one occasion that he hates going to certain areas of germany because people are `` unfriendly '' . 
  which i can not say about berlin , hamburg , dusseldorf or frankfurt ( my experience as a tourist is limited of course ) . 
  * germany and above all berlin - a lot of germans say it 's overrated but there 's tons of charm to it . 
  museums being part of it , people being extremely friendly , nightlife and there 's always something to do . 
  and you can be in the heart of everything and still be completely unnoticed if you want . 
  avoid - nothing from what i 've experienced . 
  * spain - the south is a nice place for holidays , granada , valencia , barcelona and madrid are awesome . 
  avoid shady places . 
  * ireland - guinness , enough said . 
  the locals would tell you to avoid many places but i did n't listen and still had no problem . 
  * luxembourg - kind of a strange mixture between germany , france and belgium with amazing views . 
  * bonus points - austria and france for castles and architecture . 
  i do n't really understand the concept of marriage ( or rather the point of it ) . 
  that said , if people find that it is a sign to their commitment , i think everyone should give it a thought . 
  bare in mind that the referendum took place in ireland which is known to be kind of religious ( compared to germany ) , and the results were pretty convincing . 
  i think the only problem with ireland are the fat corporations . 
  i assume the idea here is to make a reasonable minimum tax rate ( let 's say 10 % ) which will suit everyone . 
  the issue with ireland is that a certain list of companies have a very special deal with the irish authorities and it 's far less than 12.5 % * cough * apple for example * cough * . 
  do n't quote me on this but rumor has it that apple pays less than 3 % tax . 
  this . 
  it will be an ugly sight . 
  from my experience as a software engineer , this is how the beaches will look on a saturday : anti-social nerds , whales , and complete sociopaths ( and all the possible combinations ) . 
  actually that sounds like a party !, 
  let 's do it !, 
  i believe i saw a post about a pro union with romania rally a week ago or so ( in moldova ) . 
  i wonder how romanians feel about inheriting this conflict after a potential unification ? 
  dear romanians ... 
  anyone ? 
  that 's ... 
  the most german thing anyone could have possibly said . 
  and that 's a good thing . 
  would that count as a copyright infringement ? 
  no problems with it whatsoever . 
  usually it 's the extremists that have problems with it . 
  imagine if they knew it 's actually common in just about all animal species . 
  it will be funny once they do find out - a lynch mob chasing a dog cause it 's homosexual . 
  do n't tell peta . 
  focus more on education and perhaps reform the educational system - make it more aligned with the reality in the 21-st century as opposed to the late 19-th and early 20-th century . 
  fair enough , just to clear this one out : i just said it is a defense mechanism , did n't i ? 
  i have just been accused of racism just a few minutes ago ( pointing at your post ) . 
  it is very convenient to say that someone is a racist , fascist , nazi or some other outworn term when some facts are leaving a bitter taste in your mouth . 
  which brings me to the point that so far everyone has avoided answering one very important question - * what would you do in this situation * ? 
  especially when you add my past to the equation . 
  i know that life is not fair better than anyone . 
  of course i 'm not going to jump into details but going to my previous comment , you probably do n't want to know how many times i 've wondered if there 's been lsd in my coffee . 
  simply because i could not comprehend how some thoughts could come into someone 's mind , not to mention say any of them out loud . 
  some of them would definitely be bizarre even if you were a carlos castaneda character . 
  as you see , i 'm not trying to justify my initial cold attitude irl . 
  please do n't get me wrong , if i have offended you , or anyone else , that was never intended . 
  please accept my apologies . 
  but what you said was spot on - what you say almost inevitably has impacts on others . 
  what you see here is the impact and the after-effects . 
  again - i 'm truly sorry if i have offended you in any way . 
   ** might be ** missed a few words there , did n't you ? 
  if you do give it a thought instead of accusing me of everything you can possibly think of , you 'd see that this would be a very plausible explanation . 
  it 's called defense mechanism and it can be found in any living creature . 
  as for discrimination - there is such and a lot of it for that matter , whether you admit it or not . 
  my grandfather used to say something very appropriate , which would roughly translate to : `` stop looking at the fevers in other people 's eyes , look at the beams sticking out of your eyes '' . 
  in other words , take a few steps away and look around you . 
  in the past 3 years , i 've heard comments coming from english people that have really made me question the contents of my morning coffee . 
  now try to look at it from my point of view : what would you do ? 
  * start a completely pointless argument . 
  * laugh and respond `` do n't flatter yourself '' and walk away . 
  * try to avoid such situations from the beginning . 
  i do n't see how being reserved makes me ` a bigot , with jaded views who tries to flower them up a little but actually you can see the murky undercurrent of racism below . ` that 's what i mean by being neutral - if you do n't know someone , either let him or her make the first step or you keep a distance before you figure out how this is likely going to end . 
  and if you see that this will turn into another pointless storm of offences , turn around and walk away . 
  that was n't the case a decade ago but there was no need for any of that back then . 
  but times have changed and the best thing people can do is adapt . 
  accuse me all you want if that makes you feel better . 
  like it or not , it 's none of the things you mentioned . 
  it 's simply another defense mechanism . 
  nope , you 're just twisting my words and selectively picking words and phrases while excluding the crucial points : i was the one that * almost * unconditionally defended british citizens in spain and kept making up the most idiotic excuses on their behalf for every stupid situation imaginable and on top of that i was far more than willing to give my life for one particular one - so much that 8 years later , i still do n't want to hear about anything even remotely similar to a relationship . 
  but i guess the fact that you do twist my words a lot does make me think that you know that whatever farage 's comment was , is not an isolated case and it 's a common occurrence in real life . 
  and the reason for my probably somewhat awkward moments of complete silence in real life . 
  you did n't get it at all , did you ? 
  i never said `` keep away '' . 
  i said `` keep a distance '' which merely means i 'll observe people 's behavior for a certain period of time and try to figure out which way this will likely go . 
  mildly put , an unpleasant annoying/unpleasant is very plausible nowadays . 
  in fact you almost nailed one :  very similar to when farage said he did n't want to live next door to romanians . 
  selective reading ? 
  sorry for saying this but it feels like it .
