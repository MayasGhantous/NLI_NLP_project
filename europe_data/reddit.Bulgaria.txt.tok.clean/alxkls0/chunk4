  it actually took me an hour to reach him and make sure he was ok . 
  true but i mean not in such an obvious way . 
  what i mean is that while sarkozy lost a lot of his support , fn 's surge surely caused something like a paradoxical reaction among a lot of people who decided to go with hollande instead . 
  i never said that people are running from one extreme to the other . 
  hollande may be a centrist but he is a socialist and therefore on the left side of the scale . 
  which is realistically as far as people should go to avoid extremes . 
  far left or far right is never a good idea . 
  source : history . 
  i think that 's very unlikely in the foreseeable future . 
  politically , germany seems to be the most stable country in the world for that reason - there 's not a constant swinging left and right , forward and back , so it [ keeps heading in the same direction ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/electionaveragegraphgermanynext.png ) . 
  basically everything is very predictable which keeps investors interested and most people fairly satisfied . 
  a german friend of mine said something that really captures it - `` our government can be a bit annoying at times but they are doing a good job '' . 
  france , though facing a bigger thread , is still an unlikely candidate . 
  fn is being torn apart by money laundering scandals , supporting putin and loads of other * lovable things * / s. 
  and usually when a far-right party comes forward , people rightfully feel afraid and start running in the opposite direction and very commonly ending up with left government - just like france in 2012 . 
  fn saw a huge surge so people rushed towards hollande . 
  but after the recent developments around fn , sarkozy is gaining his support back . 
  i 'm optimistic about it and i do n't think there 's a reason to be afraid at this point . 
  edit : typo, 
  so [ richard dawking ] ( https://twitter.com/richarddawkins ) seems to have it all figured out when it comes to politics ( and everything he 's posted on twitter for that matter ) . 
  not surprising . 
  it 's ok in that case i guess . 
  if politically active = = member of political organizations/parties , that 's ok . actually rather big i think . 
  for some reason i was left with the impression that they were referring to the people who are fully aware of what 's going on in the the political world and how it affects them . 
   polls suggest only 7 % of britain 's population is politically active . 
  this is disturbing . 
  i realize that a lot more will vote but the percentage is still ridiculously low . 
  [ i may have the answer ] ( https://m.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1528755954046419&amp;id=1506943406227674 ) , it 's free , so far neutral territory and at the disposal of the eu ... could that do the trick ? 
  well linux is finland 's baby so no surprise . 
  the same way suse is most popular in germany . 
  as far as the year of linux desktop - i kind of doubt that . 
  we 've been saying that since '99 every year but no cigar . 
  either way - linux ftw !!, 
  actually you might be onto something there now that i think of it . 
  i remember when i was a school student around 2000 a study was made about the sexual knowledge among teenagers . 
  it was an anonymous quiz so a lot of people just put in some ridiculous stuff . 
  `` according to you which is the best way to avoid pregnancy '' . 
  one of my classmates wrote `` use cuckoo clocks '' . 
  and he was n't the only one afaik . 
  i find 12 a bit disturbing . 
  20 % saying it 's a false statement and another 10 do n't know ? 
  the hell man ? 
  probably clegg . 
  he seems to be really down to earth compared to to all the others . 
  second option - as much as i despise nationalists , as well as left-leaning parties , the snp has grown on me in some way . 
  for the same reasons . 
  that 's actually an awesome idea . 
  have my upvote !, 
  +73 million native speakers , i would n't call yours useless at all . 
  while this is true , there are a few catches . 
  * britain and more specifically the cities which suffer from shortage of it workers are utterly expensive . 
  and with that in mind , the buying power of software engineers in eastern europe get a far better deal . 
  in the uk you 'd be spending 1000 pounds on a shithole to sleep , while in eastern europe you 'd struggle to spend 300 pounds a month on rent , bills , food and transport , while salaries are not that different ( a question of a few hundred euros these days ) . 
  * from what i 've experienced no one around these regions , especially in the it sector considers the uk as an option . 
  personally - second to last after russia ( yes , even north korea seems more appealing ) . 
  articles such as the one posted being part but far not the only reason ( economy , weather , food being equally important ) . 
  if you are going to change your life , might as well choose something that you will enjoy . 
  barcelona is a breath taking city , weather is great , food is even better , not to mention people . 
  and to prove my point - around may last year - a company in the uk offered me a job in london . 
  and to break the stereotype - 78k / year ( pounds ) . 
  so no , not cheap underpaid labor taking their jobs . 
  but my answer was still unconditionally ** hell no ** . 
  * medical staff - well around these parts , the most common destinations are germany and france . 
  and for the exact same reasons . 
  and before someone twists my words or take them out of context , let 's be clear - i do n't mind brits , i do n't mind those living here but yeah , let 's keep a distance please . 
  and that does not make me anti-eu . 
  in fact i am very much pro-eu . 
  i happen to have friends from just about every member eu state ( including the uk , though come to think of it , none of the brits on my list lives in the uk ) . 
  source : well software engineer here , sharing the same work space with 200 + other software engineers . 
  immigrants over the past 4 years : france : 3 , germany : 2 , us :6 , uk : 0 . 
  with those things in mind - eastern european it guys and gals in the uk - that horse is already dead . 
  which is actually good news . 
  people state that farage is smart but actually ... let 's be politically correct for a minute and say he is not as smart as people say he is : the largest group of immigrants in the uk come from india . 
  [ and as euronews pointed out not that long ago , the uk is the state that 's handed out the most passports to non-eu citizens ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2014/11/20/citizen-gain---which-eu-countries-are-handing-out-the-most-new-passports/ ) . 
  so farage is trying to look like an appealing option to them and effectively get an extra vote or two . 
  yay , relaying on immigrants to vote for him . 
  talk about irony . 
  and let 's imagine he does become pm , the uk leaves the eu , and they shut down their borders . 
  he might be very tolerant towards people from south asia , but in 10 years time , it will be a different story : asians ( regardless of their nationality ) reproduce at much higher rates . 
  in asia and when living abroad in other countries . 
  and with that in mind in 10 years it will be `` we are loosing our culture to asians and we must change our policy . 
  15 % non-white population is intolerable '' . 
  * english * spanish * that useless language associated with the flag left of my username * german - understand it perfectly well but utterly afraid to talk ( i 've started working on that though ), 
  the iss might use some gas every now and then . 
  yes it should and should use open source solutions 24/7 , and same goes for individual countries . 
  hungary in the lead with 27 % . 
  really ? 
  well first things , local shops could try to be a bit more versatile and supply items from smaller manufacturers as opposed to things that you can get on every corner . 
  not to mention how our local shops love to double the original price tag . 
  i bought two new graphics cards last month . 
  prices across europe - around 800 euros a piece . 
  locally - 1750 euros ** each ** . 
  now guess where i bought them from . 
  and that said - screw the locals . 
  daily mail ? 
  seriously ? 
  i 'm not talking about any of the ideological stuff , i 'm talking about the individual numbers : green +5 all the parties except green and the center party saw loss in seats . 
  that 's what i 'm referring to . 
  [ well ... ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/335tsn/timo_soini_the_chairman_of_finns_party_after_his/cqhtn3t ), 
  so let me get this straight - the jabba guy de facto did not gain supporters ( actually lost some ) but basically the others lost far more supporters ( except center and green ) ?
