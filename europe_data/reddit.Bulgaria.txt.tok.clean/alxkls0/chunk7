  i know it 's the world bank and all but i 'm kind of skeptical about these numbers . 
  for instance finland has been known for having pretty much the best education system in the world . 
  and they barely make it to 37-38 % ? 
  also austria ? 
  this can not possibly be right ... 
  impossible !, 
  i 'll admit , they do drive fast but for obvious reasons . 
  but aggressive ? 
  no way . 
  in fact they are the kindest drivers from what i 've seen . 
  watched about 10 minutes of it ... 
  totally predictable . 
  greens want to save the planet , cameron constantly repeating how awesome he is and how much good he 's done , miliband stating the opposite , farag\u00e9 interrupting everyone and acting just like a communist dictator ( eu 's the reason for britain 's bad weather and every imaginable issue in britain ) , clegg was actually acting ok , snp was also doing really well , did n't hear anything from the rest in those 10 minutes . 
  soooooo ... [ scots and welsh received the most support ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/cbnahfyueaagt2g.png:large ) ? 
  talk about karma ... 
  michael bay scenes right there ... 
  sorry , forgot to mention a minor detail ... 
  the 90 's sinn f\u00e9in ... 
  now imagine if sinn f\u00e9in took part in the debate ... :d, 
  proud - not really . 
  grateful - totally . 
  i 'm grateful that i 've seen and experienced a lot of things ( both good and bad ) . 
  as i 've mentioned before , my two best friends are respectively french and german and even though we do n't get to meet that often ( maybe 3 or 4 times a year and all of us in one place , not more than once ) , i 'm more than grateful to have met them and i 'll grab the first cab to the airport if either one of them needs help and i know they 'll do the same . 
  so yes , gratefulness is all it is . 
  pride has never done any good to anyone . 
  plot twist : in rubles ... 
  nothing personal . 
  [ and besides ... ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/9e/8e/39/9e8e3915b2da7472307e7ff67b907ce8.jpg ), 
  already did once . 
  as a student but still ... * i would go to spain again if i retire early - the coast might be a nice idea - quiet and peaceful life yay . 
  the only drawbacks are the heat and the crap internet . 
  * ireland - people are lovely , i do love guinness but the weather is generally crap ( it was awesome last time i was there on a holiday but that 's the exception afaik ) . 
  * uk - abso-f-ing-lutely not . 
  * iceland - way too few people so probably not . 
  * portugal - same as spain i guess , but i would prefer spain on the account that i speak spanish ( though english is far more common around the coast ) . 
  * mayotte - same as spain come to think of it . 
  haaaahahahahahaha well someone had a lot of [ fun ] ( http://www.qwghlm.co.uk/projects/dailymail.js ) making this ...  new noun ( `` asylum seekers '' ,3,2 ) , / / nicer way of saying ` brown people ' aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahaha, 
  of course ... that 's the daily mail i 'm talking about ( or fox or rt - same thing ) - german = nazi . 
  and to further prove the point that we are nazis , my best friend is german and he is coming over next week . 
  to discuss the third reich naturally ( it 's 1939 as we all know ) ... 
  in all seriousness i think we did come up with a lot of high standard news in just a few minutes . 
  it 's in our blood it seems . 
  that 's not how you make a title for the daily mail ... ** bulgarian rammstein-loving neo-nazi immigrant declares hatred of britain ** that 's how it 's done . 
  off with his head now !, 
  such a bad time to run out of popcorn ... 
  everything and everybody ( as long as there 's no self criticism involved . 
  my shoe is untied - blame the goddamn eskimos of course ... 
  can not even begin to express how much that annoys me ( the whining , not the eskimos ), 
  well the uk and france ( partially ) are having a middle age crisis ( both literally and figuratively ) . 
  but let 's ignore that for a minute . 
  you do realize gibraltar is a very bad example ? 
  screw the trailer , dem comments ... 
  seems like fox news , rt , the daily mail and bild put together and to make matters worse , someone gave that thing steroids ... 
  this . 
  i was simply going to say ** no ** but this is more accurate . 
  he came pretty close to setting himself on fire ... [ imagine what would happen if you add flammable liquids to the equation ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbnqpmdnx88 ), 
  no particular order but poland , germany , luxembourg , spain , ireland . 
  had awesome time in all of those so ... 
  well i 'd still prefer paying for the service . 
  i do n't have a problem paying a 30-40 euro subscription if this will help the people who put the effort and made something good . 
  at this point netflix seems to be the only option and getting it up and running in a country where the service is not available is a pain in the ass . 
  i did for a while ( server in the us , a friend signing the contract for me in the us , firewalling the whole thing and so on ) . 
  it 's a pain . 
  but given a more sensible opportunity - in a heartbeat . 
  i have no idea what their arrangements are but either way - not our problem , is it :p . 
  no , i have n't ( not from trackers anyway - i have a problem with their concept in general ) . 
  that said , yes , i do end up downloading stuff but that 's simply because there 's no other way of getting my hands on some tv series ( they are either way behind or not available at all and the dub is always crap ) . 
  but if netflix becomes an option , i 'm ditching the downloading for good . 
  you have a point , even though as long as it 's in english ( or spanish or german ) , it 's fine with me . 
  my thoughts exactly . 
  on average people spend somewhere between 7 an 8 hours sleeping . 
  unless you consider breathing in carbon dioxide produced by other people sexual harassment , i do n't see how this could work . 
  but then the number would be 100 % . 
  so netflix soon probably ? 
  f * yes !!!, 
  enough with the proxies and all that crap . 
  it 's called math , they teach it in school . 
  sofia hit 2 million a few years ago with all the newcomers who do n't officially live there . 
  plovdiv with it 's metro area is over 1 million thanks to the newcomers . 
  those two alone make up half of the population and keep growing on daily basis , while the rest keeps shrinking . 
  i also happen to come from one of those smaller cities , even though i have n't lived there since the age of 6 . 
  and it 's a fact - the young population is a minority and whatever 's left of it is off to the bigger cities as soon as they hit 14 . 
  as for those who live on 100 or less - well tough luck - should have studied harder . 
  the province , as in outside the capital and the large cities , is , for the most part , totally empty ( other then elderly people ) . 
  and yes - elderly people have it pretty rough but as i said , it 's 1.5 million supporting the life of 3.5 million . 
  and think of it this way - take the 3 or 4 largest cities - the combined population of those cities makes over 70 % of the population ( adding the fact that the vast majority of people who moved to those cities are not officially registered there ) . 
  and i 've said it before - generation y , in bulgaria at least , does not care about children or some 11-th century expectation that every woman should have 2 children by the age of 19 . 
  more and more people do n't want to have children , including myself . 
  but this has nothing to do with financial reasons . 
  that 's simply not my comfort zone and i 'm well aware that being a workaholic will end really bad for any child . 
  besides the world is overpopulated so we might as well start somewhere ... 
  [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zsvae/why_is_bulgaria_the_eus_most_unhappy_country/cpm12r3 ) sums it up pretty damn well . 
  i disagree . 
  as someone mentioned earlier , it 's a national sport ( i 'm utterly happy i suck at it ) . 
  people love whining and bitching here , simple as that . 
  even when there 's absolutely no reason for it , which by the way over 97 % of the time ( see the tree next to the bus stop quote ) . 
  generation y seems to have figured out ( somewhat subconsciously ) that your expectations can be way off and you might want to re-evaluate your expectations on daily basis . 
  personally i 'd love to own a 1000 square kilometer island in the pacific ocean but let 's be realistic ... a small fraction of generation y has similar expectations but they are the exception rather than the rule . 
  as for those who love whining ( utterly happy that their number has dropped significantly over the past decade ) - the world is rarely a fair place and if it took you 60 years to figure it out , blame your parents for not taking you to a doctor when you were a child - something 's been clearly wrong with your head . 
  the world has changed and you need to constantly adapt to a new environment .
