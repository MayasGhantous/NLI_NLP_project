  in fact that 's what two generations have been fighting for . 
  well i 'm not german , but so far just about every german i 've met has told me i 'm way too pedantic , even by their standards , so yeah , personally i 'd say it 's bad : ddd, 
  do n't exactly remember but some jam . 
  nothing special , i just went to have breakfast one morning and the bill was 48 euros . 
  nope , regular pancakes in a small shop in the center of amsterdam . 
  well 2 pancakes and a cup of coffee but still ... 
  greece and spain - the calm lifestyle , no matter what happens . 
  italy - driving and shouting uk - enough rain to put out half of the stars in the andromeda galaxy and the ridiculous prices of everything . 
  germany - how friendly people are . 
  austria - no kangaroos ... finland - prices of alcohol , women do n't seem to have a problem taking the first step . 
  ireland - i was the only pedestrian in the in the entire republic who respected traffic lights . 
  netherlands - i paid 48 euros for 2 pancakes ... 
  given what i posted last night , it seems to me that newspapers are pulling numbers out their asses . 
  as i said , given a few more hours , i 'll probably be able to dig up numbers ranging from 3 to 64 million ... cute/10 . 
  sadly i do n't keep any data , other than articles for more than 45 days but those numbers alone could probably be a drop in replacement for entropy pools and much more efficient for that matter . 
  hmmmm ... actually ... ... 
  my point is that i was able to pull out a few completely different numbers on the same topic without giving it much thought . 
  given a couple of hours to think about it , i 'll probably be able to pull out such statistics in the hundreds if not thousands . 
  but here 's the thing - no two numbers were even remotely similar . 
  [ i would accept some relatively similar numbers , but seriously ? 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/margin_of_error ) that said , i 'm getting the impression that people are pulling numbers out their asses . 
  * sigh * and to think that my manager told me that 0.35 % error rates is `` too much '' a few days ago ... 
  i highly doubt it . 
  first round - maybe . 
  second round - i 'd say totally impossible . 
   [ 12:41:08 pm ] francois : i 'd vote for a communist rather than her lol ^ ^ yeah , he 's french ... 
  some people are more neutral than others i guess : dddddd, 
  alrighty then , now that a few users were , let 's call them aggressive towards my views on the subject , let me bring that up again . 
  forget the fact that i happen to be bulgarian ( just for the record - i live in bulgaria and even though i see no reason whatsoever to move anywhere , even if could come up with a logical one , the uk would be maybe not in last place but a fair second to last possibly ) . 
  now to the point : i 'm not good at giving a nice output of any kind but bare with me here - you should be able to find the text you will need . 
  [ since there is a lot on the subject and a lot of very contradicting data , could you let me know which one of the following is true and which one false ? 
  belgium has never been famous with roadworks . 
  probably not safe so if you are driving from the netherlands into belgium you should keep that picture in mind ... 
  so cute :d, 
  and then there 's border between [ belgium and the netherlands ] ( http://i.imgur.com/a0w8els.png ), 
  exactly what i thought after reading the article . 
  it is kind of misleading . 
  the article says :  in a statement released later on sunday , the greek finance ministry said that varoufakis was responding to a hypothetical question and that any referendum would `` obviously regard the content of reforms and fiscal policy '' and not whether to stay in the euro , as corriere della sera had suggested . 
  as well as  a referendum over a deal with lenders that keeps the country in the euro zone but falls short of tsipras 's promises could give the government cover to accept a deal even though it was elected with a different mandate . 
  but even floating the idea of a referendum is politically risky . 
  but yeah , the article gives little to no information . 
  that said , it might as well be on `` should tsipras wear a tie '' . 
  ... i 'm still confused ... * personally i think it 's a good thing but i ca n't figure out if i 'm alone here *, 
  i know it 's a palace rather than a castle , but i 'd add [ this one ] ( http://img.photo-forum.net/site_pics/172/h_1254066559_dsc_2002_for_web.jpg ) as well . 
  have to admit that viktor rumpelmayer has done some amazing work . 
  possible but very unlikely . 
  just to set some things straight - the article said `` 1 million * babies * '' and usually [ you need two people to make a baby ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lrtkddjas&amp;t=544 ) . 
  just saying : ddd, 
  looking at the article and the comments , i ca n't figure out if people think that this is a good or a bad thing ? 
  on a side note , i 'm pretty sure the daily mail uses some brainwashing techniques , cause i feel like my iq drops at least 2 % every time i read an article . 
  i think this is usable in just about every balkan-slavic state . 
  in bulgaria it works the same way ( except for the `` c '' at the end - we do n't have that . 
  the rest is the same . 
  true , my bad , sorry . 
  bulgaria . 
  we 're full of them . 
  some of my favourite : his/her mother and a pig - basically `` holy crap '' . 
  everything 's electricity and cables - everything is perfect . 
  beaming like jellified meat - imagine jim carrey 's face while he 's on lsd . 
  tie down your pope and your village will be calm - self explanatory . 
  `` went the horse into the river '' - nothing more we can do and you 're basically f-ed . 
   end of story . 
  [ your point of view !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qflcf4h1_pu ) < -- whining is not a point of view !, 
  end of story . 
   nobody respects us . 
   we would not be missed . 
   nobody needs us anyway . 
   we will never get the respect we deserve  we are not wanted and mocked constantly  nobody cares about us anyway . 
   we are seen as second class citizens  we beg for scraps . 
  sounds exactly like a spoiled brat whining . 
  you sort of got it right . 
  whining does not become an argument by default . 
   your entire argument revolves around `` respekt mah '' a.k.a. 
  your entire , let 's be politically correct , argument , is nothing but [ whining ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qflcf4h1_pu ) . 
  replace `` i want those sweets '' with `` respekt mah '' and you get yourself . 
  well what you just said makes it worse . 
  your entire argument revolves around `` respekt mah '' . 
  well hell no !, 
  that 's not an argument at all , that 's profanity !, 
  i 've been working on starting my own company for the past 2 years and i 'm finally getting there . 
  and by a company , i 'm not talking about a tiny shop , selling beer . 
  and surprise surprise , it will operate in the eu initially and hopefully in the us within the following 6 months or so . 
  as i said , given what you said , i completely agree with the disrespect and i do believe it 's well deserved . 
  the `` me stronk '' bit - not sure if you were even born in the not-so-distant 96-97 , but in case you were , let me ask you , how did that work out for us ? 
  what happened with the foreign investors or the good relations with the eu ? 
  short history lesson - not well . 
  you wan na grow - good . 
  who the hell is stopping you ? 
  certainly not the eu . 
  your own limited mental abilities however - probably a lot . 
  self-loathing bulgarian syndrome ? 
  when it comes to people like yourself , yes , totally . 
  which brings us to a very crucial question ? 
  what kind of respect did you expect ? 
  `` bless you , your holiness '' ? 
  tough luck !, 
  arrogant ? 
  nope , just someone who 's spend a lot of time and has put a lot of effort into building a nice life for himself and is not willing to give it away because of someone 's ** flawed nationalism and inferiority complex ** . 
  and here 's my view on the completely opposite end of the scale .
