  but it takes temporal detachment to recognize incredible errors of judgement . 
  in 50 years we 'll have a clear picture but of course politics works in 3-4 year cycles so naturally statements are made based on that tiny window of foresight . 
  if you provide them with the opportunity to get permanent citizenship they have more incentives to integrate . 
  if you keep them temporarily they 're simply a self-replenishing problem considering conflicts around the world are n't likely to stop . 
  your situation is exactly the same if you choose to integrate them or drive them away after 4-5 years . 
  of course even within the eu every country 's economic context is different . 
  seems like the immigrants understand that better than people in this thread .

  it 's a good thing that it 's not one or the other then . 
  it would be sad if we had a quota of 1 issue per internet at any one time . 
  does every conversation about fgm where circumcision is mentioned have to devolve into a display of extreme cultural bias ? 
  the perception that talking about circumcision in the same light as fgm detracts from the fight against fgm only shows that we 're as barbaric as the people we 're trying to ` normalize ' . 
  what really detracts from the fight against fgm is how hypocritical we appear to cultures where fgm is popular . 
   on a side note , the increasing psychological suffering of women due to the shape of their labia is very interesting too , as to what causes that . 
  peer pressure and porn stars with labia surgically modeled to perfection . 
  labioplasty which is usually trimming/shortening the labia is becoming more and more popular for cosmetic reasons . 
  it 's certainly not banned in consenting adults . 
  http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/circumcision/pages/introduction.aspx `` it is important to note that some ccgs in england do currently fund religious or ritual circumcision on the nhs . 
  the decision is based on priorities that relate to its own local population . '', 
  you can get it if you want to . 
  how much it costs you is kind of irrelevant . 
  but it was medically justified in the middle ages !, 
  what are you trying to tell me you believe in soap ???!!, 
  a lot of things thoroughly describe most of the balkans . 
  in the balkans we call people who make broad vague statements ` wooden philosophers ' . 
  i do n't exactly know why but possibly by contrast of the greek marble statues of philosophers and other important people . 
  that just came to me by the way so do n't quote me on that and i promise not to write a book full of irrelevant observational bullshit that any third grader could connect . 
  shut up and start organizing a searching party for nicolas sarkozy in that boat on the danube with a former gign a kubratian boy a nun and an md. 
  we have to get to them before they reach the ruins of old valyria !, 
  my paycheck will look worse in euro tho :(, 
  that 's true but they probably feel like they have nothing to lose . 
  banks shutting down , possible grexit . 
  in the circumstance i 'd probably do the same . 
  what are they going to fine them ? 
  they 'll be filing for bankruptcy anyway . 
  i was talking about mentality in general . 
  not comparing a defeated nation just recently bombed into the stone age to a nation in debt due to corruption and bad financial choices . 
  typical sweden , does the math and is nice about it even though i was off by a lot . 
  thank you , 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_greece#age_structure around 60 percent . 
  25 % unemployment tho so count those out . 
  so maybe if all the people who are able to spend 300eur they could get to that point . 
  `` i have to live in a shitty situation i did n't create . '', 
  tell that to the subsistence farmer in south-east asia . 
  at the same time i 'm from the balkans and i know how you feel . 
  however having spent several years in western europe , i can tell you while most germans do n't suffer from daily bouts of inconsolable personal guilt over wwii when there 's a problem they get together and solve it . 
  if we have to talk about mentality and generalize a bunch the balkans are the biggest moaners in the world that i know of . 
  there 's nothing that annoys me more about my compatriots than their ability to complain about everything . 
  you 'd think we all had a dostoevski-level of self-loathing and constantly seek out disappointment just so we are able to complain about it .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scouting_controversy_and_conflict#exclusion_of_individuals_from_scouting_membership you should read the above article for a list of controversial ideological and otherwise incidents that happened within the various scouts organizations worldwide . 
  so that 's where i went wrong , if only they 'd told me you 're supposed to taste it through your fingertips and not your mouth ... 
  one of the main factors why the cyrillic/glagoglic alphabets were so popular is because they were tailored to the spoken language . 
   for example , the greeks/byzantines/romans hated the slavs , so why would they make a new alphabet for people they hate ? 
  because intellectual endeavors are often not motivated by public policy . 
  scientists mainly work on opportunities , not agendas or they 're not very successful . 
  who else would you make an alphabet for but the nation that does n't have one . 
  in some areas there 's indeed more evidence than others , but the point is you do n't get anywhere with those types of arguments except to a false sense of patriotism and at the same time a conspiratorial belief that all other nations somewhat related to the events are out to get you . 
  edit : some more wild speculation : what if the romans/greeks/whatever believed that educating the slavs would bring stability into the region much like the drive to convert the khans to christianity ? 
  one of the reasons why we see a mass convergence of religions in the ancient world is because powerful people everywhere used them as a means to have a common language with both allies and enemies . 
  rather than destroy yourself in a thousand small conflicts you could much better estimate military risks when you have a strong backbone of alliances and a singular distinct enemy . 
  same with language as with religion . 
  some of the bulgarian rulers at the time were invited and studied in constantinople for the same diplomatic reasons . 
  cultural influence is very important . 
  having a common means to communicate is the basis of diplomacy . 
  [ for those of you uninitiated to the exquisite taste of `` homemade samogon '' here 's a helpful chart .

  is n't that just shitty vodka by definition ? 
  i 'm personally very tired of the very concept this thread represents for the above example and a lot of other examples . 
  you have two thousand years of history with countries shrinking and growing , going in an out of existence , then some dumb-ass group of historians in each present day nation comes up with its own geographical/genealogical/whatever . 
  reasons to claim historical achievements as their own . 
  everyone who sincerely believes any of this bullshit and is honestly offended/elated by various versions of the same stories is bad and should feel bad about themselves . 
  6eur for a large pizza and a large beer in sofia , bulgaria . 
  actually you can get cuban cigars in bulgaria and europe in general because no embargo . 
  an even closer translation is `` because it cracks * for us . '', 
  nope ... still a pun ... :[ * crack as in the sound a confetti cannister makes, 
  well that explains why it was so popular :d i never got into it . 
  the text reads `` pomorie deserves better '' and the reason why the octopus is holding a stack of euro notes is because every deal in bg is calculated in euro because of our bad experience with our own currency 's instability around 1995 when money got devalued and everyone lost their savings pretty much overnight ( think overnight 10,000 points of currency become equal to 10 points of currency ) . 
  edit : another reason for the euro notes might be recent controversy around shady businessmen/politicians rigging contests for european subsidies . 
  notice the octopus is also holding a stack of bills in one of its tentacles , as in it 's just taken a bribe or is about to give one . 
  yeah he looks smarter than most people on those candidates and he 's certainly made more of an effort for his poster . 
  you just have n't been around too many genuine village-folk then . 
  these are mostly small-town mayor/councilor candidates . 
  small towns in bulgaria hold no prospect for anyone remotely competent unless they 're running their own business so most ` normal ' , emphasis on the quotes , people move to a big city like sofia , where you can get a normal outsourced job so with two above-average pay-checks per family you can live a relatively comfortable life . 
  the candidates in the pictures are from all over the place . 
  they 're real . 
  yep he 's posing next to a beauty pageant winner , and the sign he 's holding up says `` the streets ! '', 
  so he 's promising he 'll fix up the streets . 
  there 's no platforms . 
  one is holding up a sign which says `` the streets ! '', 
  posing in front of construction work and next to a beauty pageant winner or something . 
  mobsters in bg often go for low level government positions because of the diplomatic immunity and other benefits .
