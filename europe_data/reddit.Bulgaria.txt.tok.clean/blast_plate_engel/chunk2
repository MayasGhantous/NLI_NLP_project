  ` octopus ' was the name of a foreign mafia tv show that got very popular in the 90s in bulgaria and the word has become synonymous to mafia , so he 's promising to defeat the mafia , is how i understand it . 
  a lot of the people who run for mayoral and small-town elections have a criminal background and are doing it for the diplomatic immunity . 
  as another guy said one of the people running was sentenced to jail mid-way through the campaign and is hiding . 
  i 've heard those stories too , but honestly i ca n't think of a better system to create an online encyclopedia . 
  maybe things can be improved on how changes are voted upon or how seniority is defined . 
  but ultimately you ca n't completely avoid people with ` agendas ' whether secret agents or just basement dwellers whose only shining star in their life is an extremely radical opinion on a particular topic . 
  i did n't read that they 're including the children in the hunger strike . 
  it would be insane and also criminal under any first world nations 's laws . 
  your second-grade pathos , occasional grammatical typo and the familiarity with which you refer to the person have convinced me of the truthfulness of your statements . 
  also most governments doing better than wikipedia in terms of `` freedom of speech '' and lack of political bias . 
  how fucking deluded are you ? 
  never change for anyone , macedonia . 
  yeah i know she meant to say ` vulgarian ' but it came out sounding a lot more like a b than a v. 
  that 's really fascinating . 
  it makes sense that politicians would be targeted by spam that aims to disguise itself within a political context . 
  that 's exactly what i suggested and even highlighted in the above quote . 
  sorry for messing up the proper names of the various bundles of land . 
  '' ** mf ** : we want to see the maximum trade , but we also of course outside the union , want to regain control of our borders and those two things have to be negotiated together . 
  ** r ** : well there 's no single market ** for britain ** anymore after the brexit . 
  ** mf ** : well there 's no european union anymore after brexit , i think is a better way of putting it . 
  we will still be trading with europe ... '' are you saying what he meant to say is : `` well there 's no european union ** for britain ** anymore after brexit , i think is a better way of putting it . '', 
  it could be inferred that he wanted to play on the term single market for britain vs eu for britain but it 's kind of unclear whether he meant it or not . 
  is n't it true though that as long as you had sufficient money/education you could live and work in any country pre-ww2 and borders were essentially non-existent in that sense . 
  it also says it 's illegal to possess a hand grenade in sweden . 
  so what 's the difference . 
  not all doors are made to open from the inside without a key . 
  glass doors especially so . 
  although it 's likely they 're not checking how the door opens but following standard procedure . 
  i do n't think you need to ` fight back ' to be a martyr . 
  you just need to be killed in the context of your belief . 
  all i said is the catholic church is going to condemn his death because it 's a fairly modernized religion , and they realize its ' a senseless barbaric way to die , and only later they might try to honor him in the context of martyrdom , or in some other way that honors him as a catholic . 
  in bulgaria and other places monasteries were built like fortresses for that reason . 
  churches on the other hand had to comply to decrees from the ottomans ( how tall , how pretty etc. 
  ) , who for the most part of those 500 years did n't care enough to convert the balkan population forcefully until the end when the ottoman influence was collapsing and they needed something to do to take their minds off the imminent destruction of their neat little empire . 
   for a catholic priest , being martyred while celebrating mass would be a great honor part of why christianity is able to coexist with modern society in the general sense is because most of them dropped most of that bullshit hundreds of years ago . 
  extra stress on the ` most ' part . 
  they might beautify him some years on , or honor him in another way , but at least they wo n't be so crass as to glorify his death outright . 
  hipster mitterrand let the refugees in , before it was cool . 
  as long as you do n't put us on any wooden horses , to cross the fucking poison water , by all means . 
  even then , a false flag does n't mean 99 percent of the soldiers did n't know or agree to what they were doing , or believed they were playing out a script . 
  if you leave any group of people to themselves , they 'll naturally stratify into all possible opinions , you can always find some willing to do anything you like . 
  in the setting of the army it only takes a few higher ups to convince those below them to cascade the coup orders down the chain . 
  the motives of those at the top are what matters to it being a false flag or not . 
  you 're completely right , the conspiracy dungeon finder in the real world does n't start an event unless everyone clicks ` ready ' . 
  no , but srsly , afaik at least some of the soliders were told they were going on a ` training ' . 
  so far brexit has accomplished nothing of what it was advertised to accomplish by its supporters , except given fuel to more ignorant impotent xenophobia . 
  and theresa may said nothing is happening this year , sometime after putting boris johnson in charge of foreign affairs . 
  if you need ten years to make an argument , your argument is shit . 
  silence implies assent . 
  ps : obligatory i 'm going to hell for this . 
  it 's a thread about political revisionism in science , and the top comment references political revisionism in roman times . 
  while i appreciate the topic in its historical perspective , it 's particularly emotionally and politically charged when looking at recent events . 
  while i feel bad that my comment sounded like a personal attack , i think it 's appropriate given the context . 
  or maybe nobody gives a fuck about what the name was 2000 years ago , outside of political apologia , justifying the killings of people on both sides . 
  it makes me sick listening to these arguments for or against both israel and palestine . 
  sort your shit out . 
  imagine if he was the batman . 
  still a great optical illusion example . 
  i always thought it looks like a pig because of the shape on the top-right . 
  also the capital sofia is right where the ass would be . 
  turkey will never stand much of a chance to join the eu under erdogan . 
  it 's just something we have to keep up as a conversation in the hopes of preventing turkey from further isolating itself . 
  it 's a very weak argument granted , at this point given that erdogan likely does n't care one bit about joining the eu . 
  he 's busy building a theocracy . 
  what 's the criteria for the authorities doing ` something ' . 
  deporting a set number of people as a political show ? 
  locking up most immigrants under curfew ? 
  reducing immigrant numbers accepted in the future by an arbitrary number ? 
  i 'm not being sarcastic here , but i keep hearing this complaint and i ca n't imagine what the government could possibly do in the short term ( edit : that they 're not already doing in terms of counter-terrorism ) to stop individual irrational attacks like this one , coming from both immigrants and long-term nationals as well . 
   but still , you do n't wa n't like , 38 million people to get angry at once at you , that 's why you ca n't just say public opinion is shit . 
  the question here is whether i actually give any fucks . 
  which i do n't . 
  maybe in germany the zeitgeist is more sensitive towards openly expressing dissatisfaction with public opinion because people rely more on each other to be sensible everyday human beings . 
  in bulgaria it 's a trope that everyone and everything is shit until proven otherwise and even then people are suspicious . 
  with regards how opinions are officially taken , that 's a bit irrelevant since anyone can judge a community 's opinion instantly - a community by its nature is not of the quiet sort of social organizations . 
  of course with some more discreet topics it requires actual statistics and for that we have good organizations polling public opinion with various options to respond and less pointed questions than the situation you described . 
  media quality is low that 's universally known , but it does n't excuse people for not thinking for themselves , and by that i mean absorbing information that leads to higher empirical and emotional intelligence . 
  it 's not so hard , you read books , and scientific literature and eventually you come to a point where you 're no longer ruled by your emotions on a first-come first-serve basis . 
  you also start to self-censor , and take less information at face value . 
  then you start to resent everyone else a little for reminding you of yourself from before , and also for less abstract reasons , such as the rise of european nationalism . 
   actually , no , we call that `` representative democracy '' , which had very little to do with actual democracy . 
  i was actually arguing that exact same point a couple of days ago , but i looked up the definition , and found out rather resentfully that with usage , the definition has changed , as is always the case . 
   why should public opinion on singular issues be somehow magically be more shit than when it comes to what representatives to vote for ? 
  because you do n't elect representatives on specific reactions to specific situations . 
  you elect them based on a combination of abstract policies , that may or may not be appropriate in any given context . 
  public opinion tends to be a cacophony of general ignorance in the best of times , and an echo chamber of easily manipulated reactionary rage at the worst . 
  the fuhrers you 're so eager to mention came to power exactly because they promised to fulfill the wishes of the crowd in the most unambiguous ways possible - and that is exactly what erdogan is doing right now . 
  the exact quote of his when the crowd was shouting `` we want the death sentence ! '', 
  in one of his recent speeches after the coup was `` the people will get exactly what they want . '', 
  most people would agree that most people are idiots , while they 'll also automatically agree with or accept the authority of most people on most topics that they do n't specialize in ( outside of the internet at least ) . 
  so even though my opinion above is a valid observation , and even though most people would agree that it 's a valid observation , it does n't change the dynamic of idiocy in the public space one bit . 
  is n't it beautiful !, 
  no , i 'm implying that we elect representatives not to do what the majority wants at any given point , but to direct policy in a certain way after careful consideration of the pros and cons . 
  which for good or for worse is what democracy means nowadays . 
  also , how did you get to the point of thought-crimes so fast from what i said . 
  it 's like the conversation was here , and then it went waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay over there . 
  in any case turkey is safer as a nato member imo . 
  you want to make it harder for erdogan to isolate turkey under the veil of a universal animosity to anything non-islamic and non-turkish , not easier . 
  nato member or not they 're still going to have a massive modern army and nukes . 
  do you have any reason to believe erdogan 's version of events that moderate gulenists were behind a militarized coup .
