  - you are human , not a bird . 
  spelled the same in bulgarian and serbian . 
  you could probably write a lot longer sentences that are the same if you tried . 
  problem is they do n't have the letter \u042a , and they write the latin j instead of cyrilic \u0419 . 
  so a lot of words are read the same , but they write them differently . 
  not really , \u0431 is b in cyrillic . 
  if you are writing in cyrillic , you do n't need to use numbers for letters . 
  i did n't even realize it looks like the number six with this font until you pointed that out . 
  there is still a noticeable difference though . 
  if you are used to writing in cyrillic , you should be able to tell them apart immediately without even trying . 
  cyrillic is the official alphabet , but on the internet people are often too lazy to switch their keyboard and type with latin letters instead . 
  nobody but very old people would have a problem reading bulgarian written with latin letters . 
  usually forums have a rule saying you must write in cyrillic so people put more effort there , but in multiplayer games and chat programs around 90 % of the time people write with latin letters . 
  it 's just more convenient . 
  we do n't have an official latin alphabet like serbians do , but there is \u0430 sort of universal understanding what each letter corresponds to in cyrillic . 
  obviously a = \u0410 , e = \u0415 , etc , but some more curious ones are \u0427 = 4 = ch , \u0428 = 6 = sh . 
  yes , we use numbers for letters sometimes . 
  no , it is not confusing , because you do n't normally put numbers inside words , so you know this represents a letter . 
  the reason it 's those numbers exactly , is because they start with that letter . 
  and we do n't use a substitute for \u042a at all when typing in latin , just type a instead . 
  here 's an example . 
  i think most people would read it phonetically as if it was written in bulgarian . 
  smallest is [ 1 stotinka ] ( http://iconomist.bg/media/k2/items/cache/94df8401de6d6950fb6c62e684fc2ee1_xl.jpg ) - half euro cent . 
  biggest is [ 100 leva ] ( https://vzeminagradi.com/img/prizes/100.jpg ) - 51 euro . 
  i 'll have you know city 17 is wonderful at this time of year !, 
  you are really missing out . 
  i took a train there last week and i did n't even have to pick up any cans !, 
  they are the [ 3rd happiest country ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_happiness_report ) on earth though . 
  you have been made moderator of r/serbia, 
  my favorite book as a kid was ancient greek myths and legends by eduard peti\u0161ka . 
  [ this ] ( http://i3.books.bg/products/4253/05/54253/54253z.jpg ) is exactly how it looked . 
  well they are our neighbors and their language is very close to ours . 
  i went to zaje\u010dar once with my family and people had no problem understanding us while we were shopping and when ordering in the restaurant . 
  the food was delicious by the way . 
  what most people know about serbia is their music . 
  our chalga is a copy of their turbo folk . 
  serbian music is very popular here . 
  singers like lepa brena , ceca , mile kiti\u0107 are known by everyone . 
  i know they use both the cyrilic and latin alphabets . 
  i know some major cities - beograd , novi sad , ni\u0161 , but i have n't been there . 
  i know they like russia a lot and consider them a brotherly country like some of the older people in bulgaria do . 
  i know about the secession of kosovo and that they are angry at the albanians and nato because of that . 
  a lot of people in bulgaria were angry at the government for allowing nato to use our airspace for the bombing . 
  you could hear the bombs falling on the other side of the border . 
  my father told me he smuggled fuel to serbia a few times during the war , because there was a shortage there and the prices were high . 
  i know of their president during the 90s , slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 . 
  i know he was tried in some international court but died before they could convict him . 
  i know their prime minister is called aleksandar vu\u010di\u0107 , and that people call him vu\u010di\u0107u pederu . 
  i know some swear words . 
  yes we have a political party named dost that was created to serve erdogan , but it is projected that it wo n't get enough votes to get into parliament . 
  it split from dps , which is the turkish ethnic party in bulgaria , over the downing of the russian jet by turkey . 
  i 've seen 4 black people in my life . 
  two in the capital sofia , and another two when i was on holiday in germany . 
  i 've also seen two asians once , but i only saw their backs because by the time i turned around , they were leaving . 
  ( my parents saw them and told me about it ), 
  well nobody wants it to be turkey again , i can tell you that . 
  definitely do n't want a repeat of that history . 
  maybe france ? 
  of the two listed , i would prefer russia , but turkey is more likely to join if erdogan is gone . 
  i would rather they remained as a buffer between us and the middle east . 
  of the ones you listed in 2018 , only montenegro might join soon , but it wont be in 2018 . 
  macedonia ca n't join because greece will block them due to the name dispute . 
  north-western bulgaria  bulgaria  balkans  europe, 
  i can if they are arguing and talking loudly , but it does n't bother me . 
  i 've been using firefox for the past 10 years . 
  council : spock parliament : jean-luc picard commission : data, 
  greek : oxi latin : ave , caesar . 
  polish : biale slonce pustyni . 
  irish : eire . 
  threatening intercourse with one 's mother , and describing in detail the sexual acts that will be performed . 
  in middle school we did have one american english teacher , but after that all the teachers were bulgarian . 
  i 've never seen one here . 
  i do n't think we have any . 
  in bulgarian it is \u0435\u0437\u0438-\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 ( ezi-tura ) . 
  only when watching american movies . 
  how can you even think that !, 
  i think it will happen eventually when the robots take over , but it 's still early . 
  i 've never met someone here from any of the groups listed , so most people would have very little knowledge about these countries and the people there . 
  to a person uninterested in geography , world politics or history : the first 6 are all chinese . 
  indians are gypsies . 
  last 3 are turks . 
  yes . 
  i would trust a billion dollar ai a lot more than the incompetent drivers you can come across here . 
  i have no trouble understanding the vast majority , but the jamaican accent was almost incomprehensible . 
  some may seem like it is another language at first , but then you realize it 's english with an accent a second later . 
  american accents are the easiest to understand of all . 
  maybe it 's cause their media is so popular and movies have conditioned me that way , but american english sounds the most correct to me . 
  of the native english speakers , i find british accents to be hardest to understand . 
  my favorite accents are the australian accent and the southern american accent . 
  they are fun to listen to . 
  iceland cause i like pirates . 
  they were slowly drifting in the general direction of europe , but then erdogan slammed the brakes and reversed course . 
  i would erase all disputed areas . 
  crimea ? 
  gone . 
  gone . 
  if they ca n't agree who should have it , nobody gets it . 
  also i would erase our land border with turkey . 
  an impassable void would be a much better way to stop illegal immigration than the unfinished fence we have now .
