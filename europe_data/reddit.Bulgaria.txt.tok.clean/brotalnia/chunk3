  welll the [ treaty of neuilly-sur-seine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_neuilly-sur-seine ) , communism , and the mass privatization in the 90s that led to a ton of factories and plants being closed still makes people angry today , but if i have to name one thing from history i would say the ottoman invasion and subsequent 500 year occupation was the worst . 
  that 's the actual name for the country in bulgarian . 
  almost always . 
  not common at all . 
  i do n't think most eastern european countries are too keen on multiculturalism . 
  i certainly do n't want my culture to be replaced or subjugated by another one . 
  we survived 500 years of that by the ottomans . 
  bulgaria is named that because it is people of bulgarian ethnicity that live here . 
  if you replace the native population with afghans then it wo n't even make sense to call it `` bulgaria '' . 
  it will be just a second afghanistan . 
  all peoples deserve to have their own country where they can rule themselves and write their own laws . 
  i do n't want americans telling us that people who download movies should be considered criminals , or saudis forbidding my mother from going in public without a male guardian . 
  these are their customs , not ours . 
  the whole multiculturalism and world government agenda sounds like a plan by the biggest nations to rule over the smallest . 
  it 's imperialism through immigration . 
  luxembourg for saying hungary should be expelled from the eu . 
  such hostility towards another member state should not be tolerated . 
  plus they are a tax haven which undermines other countries ' tax policy . 
  if you like the sea come to [ varna ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyjdep6-9es ) , or [ sunny beach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7zvpg3ctok ) if want to see british tourists embarrass themselves . 
  pc is the overwhelming choice in bulgaria and most of the console users only buy a specific console if it can be cracked to allow playing of pirated games . 
  it 's way too expensive otherwise cause game prices are not region adjusted and nobody wants to spend half of their monthly income on one game . 
  two grandmas were walking when one saw a bench and said `` lets sit down and rest '' . 
  they sat down and died . 
  bulgaria never had any colonies , and we actually saved our jewish population during ww2 . 
  we survived 200 years of byzantine rule , 500 years of ottoman occupation , and 50 years of soviet-imposed communism , so if anyone should feel guilty , it is not us . 
  well if we do n't start having more children , then we 'll go extinct . 
  bulgaria 's population went from almost 9 million in 1989 to barely 7 million today , and it is decreasing further every year . 
  people here use the name turks to refer to all muslims . 
  yes i can recognize most european languages , but i may confuse them with others in the same family . 
  i would have a hard time telling the difference between ukrainian and russian , or swedish and danish , but i can immediately tell that one is a slavic language , and the other nordic . 
  those people do n't seem like they value democracy to me . 
  there was an election and they lost . 
  accept the result and try again in 4 years . 
  what would happen if everyone was as stubborn as them ? 
  not accepting the result of a democratic election when the other side wins is a good way to start a civil war . 
  i would like to see them cooperating in syria to destroy terrorist groups like isis and al-nusra . 
  gypsies came to eastern europe with the ottomans when they invaded and occupied the balkans . 
  it is known that they originated from india , and they do look like indians to us , so it makes sense to call them indian . 
  since they came here while the native people of those countries were subjugated by the ottoman empire and had no control over their own land , now some view them as the ultimate illegal immigrants . 
  the fact that they refuse to integrate into society and that most do n't even speak the national language correctly , only reinforces the view that they are aliens . 
  when they tell them to go back to india , this is not meant as an insult to the country of india . 
  people would be just as happy if they left for some other country . 
  in fact [ exporting gypsies to western countries like sweden ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5-nx_gyhpm ) is a real thing in bulgaria . 
  no , why would people speak in a foreign language that they 've learned in school , instead of their native tongue that everybody in the country understands ? 
  we do use a lot of english loanwords when talking about things related to technology , but we are not speaking in english . 
  the second one is the name of the vice president . 
  here 's an old joke from bulgaria : - did you hear that they are going to line up all the criminals on the city square and shoot them ? 
  - oh , good thing i did n't become a politician !, 
  the presidential ballot looks like [ this ] ( http://kanal3.bg/assets/uploads/gallery/57392.jpg ) . 
  notice the [ new option ] ( http://i2.offnews.bg/events/2016/10/27/638656/phpyynxab.jpg ) at the bottom , it means `` i do n't support anyone '' . 
  the parliament ballot looked like [ this ] ( http://img.bg.sof.cmestatic.com/media/images/640x360/sep2014/2110226381.jpg ) in 2014 . 
  i like that they provide a counterbalance to the us . 
  downloading movies for personal viewing . 
  i laugh every time i hear that netflix revolutionized watching stuff cause you can do it through the internet now . 
  we 've been torrenting movies for like two decades now . 
  i live in a small town in the bulgarian north-west . 
  the bulgarians speak bulgarian . 
  the gypsies speak gipsy and broken bulgarian . 
  there are no foreigners . 
  and yes we do have different dialects , is n't that a thing in every language ? 
  we have an [ ombudsman ] ( http://www.ombudsman.bg/ ) in bulgaria too . 
  i had no idea that 's a skandinavian thing . 
  knights of the old republic played through it so many times i 've lost count . 
  trump and putin have both complimented each other . 
  they expect him to have better relations with russia . 
  nato is seen as a threat to russia , so the fact that trump is against it makes them really happy . 
  he also has said that he 'll work with russia to defeat isis in syria , and when he was asked about ukraine , he said the people of crimea would rather be with russia . 
  on the other hand clinton is seen as aggressively anti-russian . 
  comparing eastern europeans to the refugees is preposterous . 
  the refugees are crossing the border ** illegally ** , jumping over fences , running through the forest , and hiding in lorries . 
  people from eastern europe are coming to the uk ** legally ** using the proper entry points with the correct papers . 
  we are not sneaking over your border , people are simply using their legal right to go there as part of free movement inside the eu , just like people from any other eu country do . 
  there is no free movement treaty between any eastern european country and syria , pakistan , afghanistan , etc. 
  i do n't know what your welfare system is like , but i would assume there are requirements like having stayed in the country for a significant amount of time and having actually worked and paid taxes there . 
  i do n't think eu migrants are allowed to just ask for benefits as soon as they enter the country , as is the case with the illegal migrants crossing into europe . 
  if they just came , of course they should not be entitled to any benefits . 
  i can assure you no sane person in eastern europe expects to instantly be given free money upon entering the uk , or any other country . 
  yet the refugees seem to think europe is some kind of paradise where money grows on trees and you get everything handled to you as soon as you arrive . 
  well i guess they could make that argument , but then you 're just against the whole idea of the eu . 
  no money is being sent directly from the uk to eastern europe , you are simply contributing to the eu budget as all member states , which is then used for different purposes . 
  you are part of the decision process on where and how that money is spend . 
  your prime minister is part of the european council , and you have your representatives in the european parliament . 
  in fact you have the second highest amount of meps , so you actually have a much bigger say on how the money is spend than any eastern european country . 
  well that one is true i guess . 
  some people really are just entitled , but that does n't mean they actually have a valid claim to anything . 
  believe me , everyone gets it if you are unhappy with the gypsies . 
  that 's kinda the problem with the refugees , they 're just barging in here without permission and then expect to get free things . 
  we do n't owe them anything , it 's not bulgaria that fucked over their countries , we are not responsible . 
  not a single bomb has been dropped over the middle east by any eastern european country . 
  this is blaming the victims , instead of the xenophobes holding that sentiment . 
  if those workers are there legally , then there 's nothing wrong with working low wage jobs . 
  this is simple capitalism . 
  if two people offer the same thing , but one offers to do it cheaper , you hire the one that wants less money . 
  if you believe wages are too low for native residents to do these jobs , then why are you not raising the minimum wage ? 
  i 'm sure businesses would much rather hire a native citizen that knows the language perfectly , than having to search for workers from abroad . 
  those waves are imaginary . 
  there is no horde of eastern europeans migrants just waiting to cross over to the uk . 
  our populations are far smaller compared to those of most western countries , or other sources of migrants to the uk . 
  the amounts of immigrants from most eastern european countries is miniscule , non-eu countries like india and pakistan send a ton more . 
  the only eastern european country with a sizable amount of migrants to the uk is poland .
