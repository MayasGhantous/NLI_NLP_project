  and germany is a more popular target for migration anyway . 
  but there is an actual wave of immigrants coming ** illegally ** from the middle east , and their numbers are truly overwhelming for poor countries like ours to deal with . 
  you misunderstand our attitude perhaps intentionally . 
  we have no problem with migrants . 
  we have a problem with illegal migrants , which the refugees are since they are crossing the border illegally from a safe country where they are not in danger . 
  if any syrians or nationals of other countries obtain visas for bulgaria they are more than welcome to come here as tourist , to study , to work , or for whatever other purpose their visa allows . 
  but breaking the law and then expecting the government to pay your expenses when you get here is not fine . 
  another worry is the fact that they are coming from a totally different culture , and their countries have numerous terrorist organizations operating there . 
  eastern europe 's culture is not ** that ** different from that of the uk . 
  our countries are secular , and there is no terrorism here , so those worries do not exist in the case of eastern europeans going to the uk . 
  which again i emphasize they do legally . 
  the vast majority is on our own history between 681 to 1945 . 
  we spend a lot of time on the battles against the byzantines and the period before the ottoman invasion . 
  the communist period was barely mentioned . 
  i recall we learned a bit about the cold war and tension between the west and the soviet union during the end of the last year , but it did n't go in depth and was the last thing we learned about , so most people were n't even paying attention anymore cause they had the necessary amount of grades . 
  we did n't normally learn much about things that did n't directly involve bulgaria . 
  i remember having to memorize a lot of dates like when did this revolt against the ottomans start , when was some revolutionary organization created , when did this battle take place , etc. 
  those are not common here . 
  you should n't spend money that you do n't have . 
  people only take loans for big things like buying a house . 
  there is no refugee camp near my town , so i 've never encountered any refugees myself . 
  but it does affect me when funds from the government budget are diverted to accommodate people who crossed into bulgaria illegally . 
  my region is the poorest region in the entirety of the european union . 
  there is a giant pot hole on the street right in front of my house that has been there for almost a decade but it still has n't been fixed because of lack of funds . 
  every time it rains it becomes a pond . 
  why are europe 's poor regions being neglected , while millions are being spent on refugees ? 
  and then to top it off , we see refugees on tv demanding to be given at least 500 euros a month , while my grandparents that have worked and paid taxes all their lives get a pension that is less than 100 euros a month , and thousands more work for the minimum wage of 210 euros monthly . 
  how can you defend such arrogance and sense of entitlement ? 
  and the anti-eu sentiment that the crisis has fueled is also damaging to us . 
  the uncontrollable character of the immigration wave certainly influenced people 's minds on brexit , and now that will result in a reduced eu budget , which means less eu funds available to the country . 
  every time the government announces that they plan to open a refugee camp near a village or town , people start protesting against it . 
  they do n't want to be afraid to walk outside at night , to be at risk of getting robbed , to have people breaking into their yard in order to steal produce from their garden , to worry that there may be terrorists infiltrators among the refugees ... 
  in bulgaria the russophiles may cheer for him . 
  the really pro-western crowd generally dislikes trump . 
  that 's none of our business really . 
  i do n't think many care about who will get deported in a country that 's not even in the same continent as us . 
  bulgarian immigrants go there legally . 
  we participate in the diversity visa program every year and many people get green cards that way . 
  i do n't think that would be viewed favorably . 
  the russophiles would be happier than ever . 
  it 's one way to kick start the eu army initiative though . 
  but to be honest i think a lot more people would be pro-nato if usa was n't in it . 
  the majority of bulgarians are pro-europe , but not as many would say they are pro-usa . 
  that would be viewed very negatively . 
  everyone hates it when usa starts yet another war . 
  what 's the watered down version of `` prejeba '' ? 
  the humor comes from the non-vulgar word `` precaka '' being translated to a swear word . 
  like if `` vagina '' translated to `` cunt '' . 
  this is unlikely to seem funny to people who do n't speak bulgarian , but here 's something i laughed about recently . 
  in bulgarian the words `` precaka '' and `` preeba '' both mean something like `` screwed '' , but the second one has a stronger meaning and is cynical , because `` eba '' means `` fuck '' , while the first is not . 
  you 'll never hear people say `` preeba '' in a formal setting , cause it 's a swear word , but `` precaka '' is okay . 
  so in [ this ] ( http://www.slavishow.com/%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%ba-%d0%b5-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d1%81%d1%80%d1%8a%d0%b1%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8-%d1%89%d0%b5-%d1%81%d0%b5-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%86%d0%b0%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%88/ ) video from a bulgarian evening comedy show that i watched , the main guest was a serbian singer , and there was an interpreter who translated things back and forth . 
  a cast member of the show asked her to translate `` precaka '' to serbian , and she started laughing immediately , cause apparently it 's `` prejeba '' . 
  i walk . 
  for long distances i take a bus . 
  have n't you heard the saying ?

  [ look at the election statistics ... ] ( http://offnews.bg/images/events/2014/10/05/398991/1412533299_2_559x*.jpg ), 
  why would we want to give dobruja to romania ? 
  on the other hand [ 1944 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/nwiljcv.png ) looks pretty good !, 
  it 's the other way around at least in bulgaria . 
  young people are pro-eu , and older people are pro-russia . 
  according to polls we have more confidence in eu institutions than in our own here . 
  well kids like dressing up in costumes , but it 's not really a tradition in bulgaria . 
  a lot of older people are against it cause it 's an american holiday and they think we should stick to our own culture . 
  when i was a kid we had a costume competition at school one year and i won second place for dressing up as baba yaga . 
  going house to house and asking for candy is not a thing at all though . 
  according to wikipedia , the continent of europe is slightly larger than the usa , but that 's counting the european part of russia . 
  our population density is much higher though , so the total population is double that of the us . 
  and we are definitely more distinct . 
  my german uncle had a culture shock when he first visited bulgaria . 
  he kept taking pictures of the passing gipsy horse drawn [ wagons ] ( http://www.mignews.info/wp-content/uploads/tsiganska-karutsa.jpg ) all the time . 
  everyone knows where poland is cause it 's a big country . 
  i often confuse latvia with lithuania though , as the second is called litva in bulgarian , and i keep forgetting which is which :d, 
  basically every turbo-folk song . 
  i remember my father used to watch concerts on pink tv when i was a kid . 
  it 's the only serbian channel that was broadcasted here because of the music . 
  lepa brena and ceca are very famous . 
  mile kitic is like a god in the northwest . 
  it 's not a coincidence that almost [ all of the comments ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7difrsov66c ) on his songs are in bulgarian :d in fact i went to his concert in sofia last week !, 
  i 've also heard that bulgarian soldiers in afghanistan listened to roki vulovic and other war songs from the 90s to boost their morale . 
  i wish the climate was milder . 
  the summer is too hot , and the winter too cold . 
  i bet your halloween costume would have been quite different if you had googled it in [ bulgarian ] ( http://imgur.com/a/ahyt6 ) instead :d most people would recognize that nebraska and oregon are the names of us states , even if they do n't actually know anything about them . 
  that 's because american movies and the entertainment industry are popular worldwide , so we learn a lot of things about the us from tv even if we did n't intend to . 
  we hear about your election on the news almost daily . 
  calling politicians who act like clowns `` donald trump '' has become a thing now . 
  yes it 's weird . 
  bags are for solids . 
  bottles are for liquids . 
  from what was reported in bulgarian media , they found crates with bombs and ammo near his home in belgrade , but no attack took place . 
  of course songs in english are very popular in bulgaria because america 's entertainment industry is popular worldwide . 
  serbian and greek music is also commonly listened to here , as it is quite similar to our own . 
  there are a ton of examples of covers of greek and serbians songs with the same melody , but with bulgarian lyrics . 
  he 's happy cause he 's getting things for free . 
  they can be very dangerous otherwise . 
  most people avoid dealing with them . 
  when you make one mad , they tend to call all of their relatives and friends to come beat you up . 
  this [ picture ] ( http://bez-cenzura.com/media/k2/items/cache/b069b892c6725bd357423bc8f6c17d01_xl.jpg ) is an actual example of that . 
  marriages between gypsies and outsiders are rare .
