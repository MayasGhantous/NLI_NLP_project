  they are very self-segregated . 
  they mostly live in their own gipsy-only neighbourhoods . 
  most are unemployed and live on government benefits , most of those being child benefits cause they have many children . 
  some `` collect '' metals and then sell them for scrap . 
  there have been train incidents caused by gypsies stealing part of the tracks to sell them cause they 're made of metal . 
  some gipsy women work on government programs where they 're paid to sweep and clean the streets . 
  the government has tried hard to make them send their children to school by tying child benefits to it , but they skip a ton of classes , and often drop out . 
  the majority are just given the minimal grade to pass the class by teachers , even though they do n't even show up most of the time . 
  illiteracy rates are very high among them . 
  there are quite a few humorous videos around the internet of people asking them simple questions , and then filming their answers . 
  most of them ca n't even speak bulgarian properly , so just listening to them butcher the language can be comedic . 
  but it 's also sad at the same time . 
  there are a few successful gypsies , but it is rare . 
  some examples are [ azis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfabhqd6y_y ) , a gay pop-folk singer , and [ sofi marinova ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnughkltbxk ) , also a singer . 
  you ca n't ** make ** gypsies do anything . 
  they live the same way everywhere and do n't care about laws . 
  most of the houses in those neighbourhoods are actually illegal ( no permit to build , they do n't own the land , etc ) , so they ca n't even have access to the electrical grid or water supply . 
  they usually attach themselves to the power poles on their own and use the electricity for free . 
  some of them have tens of thousands of euros in debt to the power companies , but there is no way to collect the money , or turn off their electricity without turning it off to the whole neighbourhood . 
  to have your garbage taken you also have to pay a small tax , which they usually do n't . 
  sometimes in the smaller neighbourhoods the government sends in the gendarmerie for security , and then they bulldoze all the illegal buildings , which most of the time is all of them . 
  and no , it 's not germany , it 's bulgaria . 
  - [ here 's a video of a young gipsy gentleman , proudly explaining to news reporters how he steals electricity . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8bds3y1nn0 ) after that you can see video footage and an interview with locals from inside one of the neighbourhoods in the pictures i posted before . 
  i am not sure , but the amount of trash is typical for gipsy neighbourhoods . 
  they are not fond of cleanliness . 
  bulgarians usually never enter those districts . 
  here is another picture from [ stolipinovo , plovdiv ] ( http://www.budnaera.com/pix-common/gypsies07_stolipinovo.jpg ) , and one from [ pleven ] ( http://www.novini.bg/uploads/news_pictures/2012-13/big/cigani-obezkostiha-16-etajen-blok-v-pleven-61726.jpg ) . 
  according to [ wikipedia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_tunisian_citizens ) you can go to serbia without a visa . 
  that 's a normal , secular european country with a rich history and a lot of cool places to visit . 
  of course it 's not as rich as western europe , but you wo n't have to worry about `` idiotic religious rules '' there . 
  i 'd say 9/10 . 
  we are n't in the news very often , and non-european media probably never mentions us at all . 
  the only thing about bulgaria i recall hearing in foreign media recently was about dinko ` the migrant hunter ' . 
  nope . 
  i do n't think that 's a thing in bulgaria . 
  english classes in school do n't include english literature , we just learn the language . 
  who needs rednecks when you 've got [ gypsies ] ( http://bez-cenzura.com/media/k2/items/cache/1a1c7a0ba8794f499343f3710b15a9ab_xl.jpg ) ? 
  ( nsfw ) there 's plenty of tragicomedic material right there .

  ] ( http://www.svobodnoslovo.eu/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cigani.jpg ), 
  i play hearthstone sometimes , although i mostly watch others play as it is more entertaining , and i 'm looking forward to a kotor remaster . 
  not sure if it is actually gon na happen though . 
  also i tinker with wow as a hobby , but i do n't play it anymore . 
  the balkans have seen some floods in recent years . 
  there was a house near the river in my town that collapsed due to it . 
  yes , my grandmother likes hanging religious icons around the house . 
  well i do n't think most bulgarians would think of their country as `` the west '' , but we are certainly more westernized , and part of the western sphere now ( eu , nato ) . 
  here being western is often associated with being `` rich '' or having a lot of money , and we are poor compared to western standards . 
  if i 'm talking with non-europeans then yeah , but of course every european country is different . 
  but i do generally sympathize more with other europeans than distant countries . 
  schools are for education , not fun . 
  it 's supposed to be boring by definition . 
  i love the sound of serbian . 
  as a kid i hated german , but now i kinda like it . 
  nordic languages are weird . 
  not a big fan of spanish and romance languages in general , although french and italian are the better sounding among those . 
  irish , scottish , turkish sound funny . 
  russians speak with this weird accent/intonation that makes it sound like they are complaining or asking a question . 
  i like playing as the romans in such games . 
  in bulgaria the cops avoid going into gypsy neighborhoods . 
  i remember my father telling me that a friend of his who is in the police complained that the only way to do his job there would be to call the gendarmerie , but then he would have to do a ton of paperwork . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzxz87qfgho ), 
  in bulgaria they are known for having the best whiskey . 
  i do n't think anyone has anything bad to say about scotland . 
  i hope they achieve independence soon . 
  it is done in bulgaria usually between relatives that you have n't seen in a while . 
  most bulgarians would name a different politician , depending on their political views . 
  but some of the more universally disliked ones are [ volen siderov ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfeu9yz7isc ) and [ ahmed dogan ] ( https://youtu.be/vr1ak3tsoqk?t=15s ) . 
  the author is turkish , it 's was a propaganda film . 
  the so called `` historian '' that talks in the film is an american who also actively denies the armenian genocide . 
  it was talked about all over bulgarian media . 
  when you type '' \u0410\u043b \u0414\u0436\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0430 '' in google half the results on the first page are all about that . 
  here is a [ video from bulgarian tv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqatn-m7qse ) where they expose the lies in the film . 
  ( it 's not in english ! ), 
  i do n't know if al jazeera is available in bulgarian , nor would i watch it if it was . 
  the documentary in question was in english and turkish . 
  al jazeera is hated by a lot of bulgarians because of that scandalous documentary they did where they distorted history and said we were the bad guys for expelling the ottoman invaders that occupied us for 500 years . 
  they basically tried to make the point that bulgaria 's territory belongs to turkey . 
  ca n't think of any words atm but i remember discovering that the girl from the `` overly attached girlfriend '' meme is an american youtuber named `` laina '' , and that it is actually a popular name in english speaking countries . 
  her name literally means `` shit '' ( plural ) in bulgarian . 
  pizza . 
  i 'm just hoping a small meteorite just happens to fall on their position during the next debate and the world is spared having to endure 4 years of both of them . 
  as to who 's scarier , trump may be the obvious comic-book style villain , but i 'm more scared of the insidious double-faced menace that is clinton . 
  if trump was to be elected every reasonable person in the country would unite in opposition to him , and all the crazy policies he puts forward would be blocked by the rest of the government . 
  but seeing as the guy is a total clown with no experience in politics whatsoever , and is most likely in this for fame and money , he would probably backpedal on all of his campaign promises , sit back , and let his vp and the other standard republicans be in charge of everything . 
  he basically proposed this to kasich on condition he became his vp , but the guy did n't want to support him and turned down the offer . 
  and he already went back on some of his promises . 
  remember how he ruined ann coulter 's new book launching party by flip flopping on his core issue - immigration , basically rendering the whole book meaningless ? 
  then after 4 years when trump has been exposed as total fraud the democratic candidate would win in a landslide , and everything will be back to normal , except that we 'll probably get a much better candidate than clinton . 
  meanwhile if clinton wins , she 'll continue pushing corporate policies and free trade agreements like the ttip , with full support from the corporate republicans , while progressive democrats would be shamed and branded as traitors for not supporting the president if they did n't go along with it . 
  then in 4 years you 'll have to chose between 4 more years of her , or another republican , probably someone like ted cruz . 
  i certainly do n't like these choices . 
  so in conclusion i 'm more scared of senator palpatine , cause i think the over the top evil clown is full of hot air . 
  i 'm for it as long as states get to keep a good amount of autonomy . 
  i think it would be very good for the poorer countries . 
  yes , [ constant ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_wars_involving_the_united_states ) . 
  no other country has been involved in so many conflicts all over the world as the us .
