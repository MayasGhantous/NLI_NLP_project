  probably , but i meant it in the context of geographical size where russia is several times bigger than the eu . 
  that would be more like the eu joining russia . 
  how does vice get access to these jihadists ? 
  are n't they afraid the same fate will befall their journalist ? 
   all they 've done is killed more of their own people and furthered the hate of the western world for all muslims . 
  that 's been their purpose all along . 
  to make even moderate muslims hated in the west so that they can come in as their protectors . 
  are you suggesting that he knew that the plane was civilian and deliberately shot it down ? 
  i thought they shot it down because they considered it a ukrainian military plane . 
  `` ay\u015fe tatile \u00e7\u0131ks\u0131n '' would more accurately be translated in the imperative as `` let ayshe go on vacation '' or `` ayshe should go on vacation '' `` ayshe goes on vacation '' in turkish would be `` ay\u015fe tatile \u00e7\u0131k\u0131yor '' . 
  a lot of people could have said the same thing about romania and bulgaria before they joined . 
  in fact i am sure there are a lot of western europeans that resent the presence of these two countries in the union . 
  that is an urban myth perpetuated by greek nationalists . 
  i have n't seen any actual scientific evidence for that assertion . 
  the red parts correspond to the coalition of chp + mhp . 
  mhp is a ultra-nationalist turkish party - i ca n't imagine any of their supporters being thrilled about joining greece . 
  it looks like the partially obstructed sign in turkish says :  bu i\u015fyerine it girebilir ama ** yahudi ** asla !, 
  which literally translates to  this workplace dog enter/can but ** jew ** never !, 
  yahudi means jew in turkish . 
   this pipeline is estimated to provide around 15-20 % of all eu 's natural gas needs for close to a century i think that is based on the shaky premise that the source of the natural gas will continue to operate freely and uninterrupted . 
  given the lebanon-israel dispute over the gas fields , israel 's war with hamas , and the rise of isis in the region , i think that is quite unrealistic . 
  we do n't know what the map of the middle east will look like in a year , let alone a century . 
  yeah right . 
  supposedly everybody coexisted peacefully under the ottoman empire until its bloody dissolution . 
  if it was n't for the turkish intervention cyprus would have most likely ended up like crete . 
  the island had a sizable [ turkish population ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cretan_turks ) which was wiped out when the island was annexed by greece . 
  cyprus was an artificial colonial construct of britain . 
  there were no people that called themselves cypriots really - there were only greeks and turks on the island ( and a few maronites and armenians here and there ) . 
  by equal do you mean a unitary state where people are equal on an individual level ? 
  or do you mean a federation with two equal component states - one turkish and one greek ? 
  i thought a unitary state was a big no-no for the turkish cypriots because it would render them a helpless minority that would be easily assimilated into the dominant greek cypriot community . 
  it was called [ enosis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enosis ) - a movement among greek cypriots that sought to unify the island with greece . 
  exactly . 
  some people have this irrational phobia of anything nuclear . 
  if you actually look at the charts , nuclear is the safer in terms of people killed per kilowatt generated . 
  safer than even solar which has had a few accidents during rooftop installation . 
  the south stream project in its present form where it allows gazprom to monopolize the pipeline is in contravention to eu law . 
  it wo n't happen unless other suppliers are allowed to use the infrastructure . 
  wow . 
  croatia already has an anti-eu party . 
  that was quick . 
  how long has it been since they 've been members already ? 
  and today lavrov is in bulgaria , preaching on how eu membership should not be an obstacle to common projects with russia : http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2014/07/07/2338772_chlenstvoto_na_bulgariia_v_es_ne_triabva_da_prechi_na/ let 's see if he will be able to revive the south stream project . 
  the present government is standing on its last leg , and it would be ridiculous if it were able to cause any more damage before its resignation . 
  how is this not a violation of free movement within the eu ? 
  the geostrategic importance of cyprus for turkish security and access to the mediterranean sea is immense . 
  in comparison , the money spend is just pocket change . 
  what incentive would turkey have to make concessions on the cyprus issue , if its membership remains as open ended as ever ? 
  cash machines are working just fine . 
  the crisis mainly affects institutional depositors and shareholders . 
  i oppose this ban . 
  i think it is completely unnecessary and the issue has been blown out of proportion . 
  after all how many full veil women are there on the streets of europe ? 
  i for one have yet to see one . 
  it may be further from superpower status , but its got crimea . 
  turkey joining the eu does not imply that it will suddenly join schengen as well . 
  you can still have it as a member , while keeping the current border arrangements that will prevent migrant influx across the bulgarian and greek borders . 
  so the only one left in the balkans is bosnia . 
  hopefully we will not see the hyper-inflationary collapse of the economy that we witnessed in the 90s . 
  south stream was shut down because it violated eu laws , in particular those pertaining to eu energy market rules forbidding energy producers from simultaneously owning transmission networks . 
  in its current form , only russia would have been allowed to supply gas through the pipeline . 
  not only that but bulgaria has also put itself in the absurd position of committing to provide the most favorable tax regime to gazprom , while covering the fiscal shortfall with funds from eu aid . 
  since when is the eu in the business of subsidizing gazprom ? 
  the eu commission did not give any orders , it simply informed the corrupt bulgarian government of the consequences if they were to proceed with a project that was extremely problematic from a legal point of view . 
  the construction and operation of the pipeline were going to be done in a way that that would have violated both bulgarian and eu laws . 
  in fact the contract is still hidden from the public , and it is not at all clear what its exact terms are . 
  what is known is that only russian gas would have been allowed to flow through the pipeline , and that would have further solidified gazprom 's monopoly over bulgarian energy supply . 
  however , if the project is done openly and all legal requirements are met , i would welcome it wholeheartedly . 
  the eu threatened to cut eu funds , and the junior coalition member ( the turkish dps ) , whose former leader once boasted of playing a major role in the distribution of those funds , could n't afford to lose them . 
  in my view the commissions decision to suspend funds was really what triggered the collapse of the government . 
  wonderful . 
  looking forward to them joining the eu . 
  wow . 
  sofia is the worst . 
  in what way is this a reason for turkey not joining the eu ? 
  they may be ethnically turkish , but are bulgaria citizens nonetheless . 
  unlike the turks in germany they are not recent immigrants in the country , and have been there since the establishment of the bulgarian state when it gained independence from the ottoman empire . 
  and i think at the end he called them lesbians . 
  presumably that was meant as an insult . 
  i wish we had [ sepa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/single_euro_payments_area ) . 
  currently we are paying really ridiculous banking fees for transferring money to europe . 
  it should be noted that the current bulgarian government is really pro-russian - in general the population is n't really so friendly . 
  which in effect amounts to banning that new activity . 
  they can just print it . 
  i have been asking myself that question as well . 
  why does n't bulgaria have the euro ? 
  it already fulfills [ all the requirements ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgaria_and_the_euro#status ) - its just a matter of complying with one last formality - erm ii membership for two years . 
  i wonder if we will be the next to join after lithuania . 
   is there such a base for erdogan in turkey , moderate regular working class people , who likes what his economic reforms has done for them , but lack to see how he is slowly eating up the constitutional backbone of the turkish republic ? 
  yeah , the bbc actually wrote an article about them in 2006 . 
  i believe the term that they used is `` islamic calvinists '' . 
  here is the [ actual article ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4788712.stm ) . 
   yet the new entrepreneurialism sweeping across the province is providing an unlikely catalyst for a remarkable religious transformation . 
   a new form of turkish islam is emerging here , one which is pro-business and pro-free market , and it 's being called islamic calvinism . 
  you have to wonder if twitter is actually halal for [ the conservative prime minister to sink his teeth into ] ( http://i.imgur.com/c1gtat0.jpg ) ? 
  somebody is really itching to get an armed conflict going . 
  and what 's wrong with ranting about the mother tongue ? 
  [ the framework convetion for the protection of national minorities ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/framework_convention_for_the_protection_of_national_minorities ) to which bulgaria is a signatory obliges the country to do much more for the protection of minority languages than it is presently doing . 
  besides if you ever listen to lutvi mestan speak in turkish ( [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hifzehoaqhg ) for example ) he can hardly speak the language , and clearly has difficulties in pronouncing some words , and is unable to express himself properly . 
  please , do n't drive up the house prices for us .
