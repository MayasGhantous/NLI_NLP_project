   conquered territories the conquered territories were under joint nazi military administration . 
  [ bulgaria did kind of also ] ( http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=68270 ) . 
   that wage differences are still huge but that 's the whole point of free trade - to exploit the comparative advantage of an economic party to produce a particular good or service at a lower marginal and opportunity cost over another . 
  what you are advocating for is protectionism for local swiss labor , which is a fine position to have , but then do n't say you are for free trade . 
  [ kokorech ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kokoretsi ) is a dish of the balkans and anatolia consisting mainly of lamb or goat intestines , often wrapping seasoned offal , including sweetbreads , hearts , lungs or kidneys . 
  the intestines of suckling lambs are preferred . 
  free trade is good , but not free trade in human labor ? 
  perhaps the time has come for my turkish friends to learn how to use [ tor ] ( https://www.torproject.org/ ) . 
  the money that ukrainian oligarchs bring in is peanuts relative to the economic benefits that would accrue if the ukraine were integrated into the eu sphere of influence - we are talking orders of magnitude difference . 
  my personal view is that the eu has been tame in its dealing with ukraine primarily because of its fear of russia . 
  russia holds the big stick of energy dependence and can cause a lot of economic pain in europe if pushed to the limit . 
  what exactly does that mean ? 
  after losing ukraine , allowing turkey to drift away could become a geopolitical disaster for the eu , especially from an energy security point of view . 
  western vs eastern europe has connotations from the cold war where the former implied nato and the latter the warsaw pact . 
  turkey was on the side of nato and so from that perspective has closer ties to west than to the east . 
  bulgaria will not veto macedonia 's entry . 
  although the two countries have their differences , bulgaria considers macedonia as its sister nation and has close cultural and linguistic ties . 
  bulgaria vetoing macedonia would be akin to greece vetoing cyprus - not going to happen . 
  i think the only way russia can get into the eu is if it gets broken into smaller pieces , and they gradually become assimilated into the eu one by one . 
  for english to gan an official status , it needs to undergo significant changes first . 
  for a start , it needs to do away with this ridiculous spelling , and spell words closer to how they are pronounced today . 
  that would make it significantly easier for others to learn the language . 
   this the picture of the priest with the guitar reminded me of this recent story from turkey , where [ an imam did rock 'n' roll ] ( http://www.npr.org/2013/11/02/242515171/turkeys-rockin-imam-inspires-youth-tests-religious-boundaries ) in his spare time . 
  can you elaborate in what way the greens are anti-science ? 
   we all have to get new ones again without ebpo i think you mean \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e . 
  what supermarket was that ? 
  let me know so i make sure i never purchase from them again . 
  i think the trend is towards countries breaking up into smaller pieces , not reunifying into larger ones . 
  i predict the emergence of new nation states in europe , not the merger of existing ones . 
   but the population trade with greece worked out pretty well , eventually . 
  except it did n't . 
  the cost of that exchange in terms of lives , livelihoods and human suffering was enormous . 
  both greek-speaking muslims and turkish speaking christians were uprooted from their homelands where their had lived for centuries if not millennia , and forced to relocate to a completely foreign environment . 
  the cultural identity of many towns and villages was changed beyond recognition . 
   would n't the fact the vast majority of turkey is located in asia be a bigger obstacle to joining the european union ? 
  cyprus is located in asia in its entirety , and yet it is a member . 
  given how much of the british gdp consists of the non-productive financial sector and is concentrated in the `` city '' , i highly doubt that this would be a positive thing . 
  this reminds me of the old times when living standards in the warsaw pact were kept artificially high relative to the mainland russia in order for the kremlin to keep on maintaining its empire . 
  a lot of bulgarians want a unification with macedonia as they view the separation of the two countries as a cruel historical mistake . 
  however , i do n't think macedonians are too keen on such a union - in fact a lot of them openly resent it as bulgarian irredentism . 
  for the virulent anti-turkish vitriol that they have been throwing around , it is ironic that it is precisely them that are keeping the party of the [ bulgarian turks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_bulgaria ) in power . 
  here is a sample of [ fake english ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt4dfa4foey ) . 
  it gives you an idea of how the language would sound if you did n't understand it . 
  try doing the same for a person on the other side of the world . 
   wherever there is money there will always be middlemen perhaps you are not familiar with the technical intricacies of how exactly bitcoin works , but its main innovation is that it solves precisely the problem of having middlemen in financial transactions . 
  indeed if the bitcoin protocol is as sound as it seems , for the first time in human history will be able to send `` money '' from point a to point b of the planet without any third-party intermediary . 
  now it can be debated whether bitcoin is really currency , or whether it is a commodity or a security , or just a decentralized accounting ledger , but still it provides a decentralized infrastructure for transmitting value and that is truly revolutionary . 
  i am really envious of the estonian e-government system . 
  i wish bulgaria had such a developed electronic infrastructure . 
   the london-based body also revealed that it was carrying out an assessment to look at the possibility of regulating the financial capital of banking fraud ... 
  a rogue regime lead by right wing nuts like avigdor lieberman , blatantly defying international law and advertising itself as `` the only democracy in the region '' while openly practicing apartheid policies is n't something that cern should be cooperating with especially on sensitive matters such as nuclear research . 
  while at it , why not get iranians scientists involved as well then ? 
  so what exactly is their business model then ? 
  are they selling data on the listening habits of their customers ? 
  what exactly is the catch here . 
  has israel signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty yet ? 
  if not , is there any guarantee that israel will not use any knowledge gained from this research for military purposes , and to gain further strategic advantages over its neighbors ? 
  can anyone give me a good reliable european email provider ? 
  a book in the future will probably one day document the same about the nsa . 
  we will look back terrified at what we were subject to . 
  if there was any honor in the eu they would not have let cyprus in the first place after its flagrant rejection of the annan plan that was supposed to unify the island before membership . 
  even eu commissioner [ verheugen said he felt cheated ] ( http://euobserver.com/enlargement/15270 ) at the time . 
   mr verheugen said that the decision in 1999 not to make a solution to the cyprus conflict a prerequisite for cypriot accession to the eu , was `` on the understanding that the government of cyprus would do everything in its power to resolve the problem '' . 
  what happened instead was that cyprus joined as a divided country effectively at war with its other half . 
  as for syria , most of the major eu powers including britain and france are also actively engaged with the rebels in syria , and that includes the extremists as you can not readily distinguish the two . 
  [ france was instrumental , alongside the uk , in lifting the european union arms embargo on syria which would allow supplies to be sent to the rebels ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/revealed-what-the-west-has-given-syrias-rebels-8756447.html ) . 
  it 's a secular country . 
  i think it would be more appropriate if you replace turkey with erdogan . 
  the overwhelming majority of turks never waned a war with syria 's assad . 
  the support for the rebels was merely a part of erdogan 's little imperial games , not an expressions of the will of the turkish people . 
  for those of you worried about nsa surveillance and how the hi-tech industry is too us dependent , perhaps this is an opportunity to put your money where you mouth is . 
  you are phrasing the question wrong . 
  it 's not a question of whether russia that will become a member of the eu , but whether the eu will join the russian federation - just look at the physical size of the two entities for gods sake . 
  after losing ukraine , perhaps the eu is now afraid of losing turkey as well . 
   bright ukrainian minds not fleeing en masse to europe ? 
  introduce exit visas , end you 'll make sure they stay in the country forever . 
  good old soviet times !, 
  please , stop editorializing the titles . 
  it 's a bit premature for russia to declare victory yet . 
  i already bought a beer in berlin 's kreuzberg district with it . 
  here is a [ turkish clip by can atilla ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wjwenu4gmy ) that depicts the city just prior to its fall . 
  it also shows the building without minarets . 
   still though , oath has nothing to do with ataturk , it has to do with pan-turkism . 
  when i was first grade in bulgaria , i had to recite a poem called [ '' \u0410\u0437 \u0441\u044a\u043c \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0447\u0435 '' / `` i am a bulgarian kid '' ] ( http://az-deteto.bg/az-sam-balgartche/33/view.html ) , even though i am ethnically turkish . 
  the poem is roughly equivalent to the turkish [ `` ne mutlu turkum diyene '' / `` how happy to be called turkish '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ne_mutlu_t%c3%bcrk%c3%bcm_diyene ) . 
  here is my attempt to translate it to english :  i am a bulgarian kid , and a strong mother has given birth to me ; with beauty and abundant virtues my homeland is kind . 
   i am a bulgarian kid . 
  i love our green mountains , ** bulgarian to call myself makes me greatly happy . 
  **  i am a free bulgarian kid , in a free land i live , everything that is bulgarian and home-bred i love , worship and yearn for . 
   i am a bulgarian kid and i grow in magnificent days , in glorious times , i am the son of a beautiful land , i am the son of a heroic tribe . 
  if you notice the highlighted part , it is almost a verbatim translation of the turkish poem `` ne mutlu turkum diyene '' . 
  i would bet that similar poems exist in other neighboring balkan countries . 
  as far as i know the poem is still recited and learnt by heart by first-graders in bulgaria . 
  so to call such poems a sign of pan-anything is a bit strong in my opinion . 
  this is not about membership - it is about free trade . 
  turkey , for example , already has a free trade agreement .
