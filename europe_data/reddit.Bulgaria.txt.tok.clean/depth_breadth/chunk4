  he was drinking raki , and he said he should n't get too drunk because he had to wake up early and get on a bus to sofia in the morning . 
  i do n't remember how much they were going to pay him . 
   the socialist and centrist parties bsp and dps are shipping people from around the country by the busload to form counter-protests in favor on the current government . 
  funny thing is i was at my uncle 's house for dinner yesterday , and he was planning on joining the protest ( we are ethnic turks and i presume he usually votes for dps ) . 
  i have lived abroad for a long time , and i always heard anecdotal evidence that people get paid to join protests , but i never realized how blatant the whole thing was . 
  he just matter of factly stated that he was going to go to sofia with some transportation the party provided and he was going to be paid this and this much for that . 
  i guess people are so disillusioned with the whole political system - it 's does n't matter who is in power ; it is the same shit anyway - so they just take the highest bidder and attend their protests . 
   have to point out though that birth control is n't really sterlization but sterilization is birth control . 
  besides when saying birth control one imagines some sort of benign pill . 
  in the case above people were actually injected with stuff . 
  [ israel forcibly injected african immigrants with birth control ] ( http://www.forbes.com/sites/eliseknutsen/2013/01/28/israel-foribly-injected-african-immigrant-women-with-birth-control/ ), 
  does n't roc already have an embassy in erbil - the kurdish capital ? 
  yes . 
  apparently [ 1.4 million have already gotten bulgarian citizenship ] ( http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=124362 ) . 
   ( romania gives every moldawian the romanian citizenship ) same thing with bulgaria and macedonia . 
  not really . 
  at the time when the first humans were evolving , europe was nothing more than an uninhabited swamp covered with dense forests and vegetation . 
  this is not going to end well for the government . 
  it reminds me of the uprising that erupted against the [ videnov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zhan_videnov ) government in 1997 . 
  there is already a [ kurdish regional government ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdistan_regional_government ) and turkey has relatively [ good relations with it ] ( http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/turkey-cozies-the-krg-6975 ) . 
  besides your statement is hypothetical . 
  the situation in cyprus on the other hand is real . 
  the facts on the ground show that the roc is not a country , or at least not in the normal sense of the word where the government has control over all of its territory . 
   turkish cypriots are colonists that were brought to the island by turkey from anatolia following the turkish invasion in 1974 what utter rubbish !, 
  the turks in cyprus have a long history that dates back to when the island was conquered by the ottomans in ( 1571 ) [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman_cyprus] . 
  turkey recognizes `` cyprus '' for what it is - a greek entity representing solely the population and territory south of the buffer line . 
  requiring turkey to recognize that entity as having jurisdiction over the whole island before a comprehensive and just settlement of the cyprus problem would be tantamount to demanding the complete capitulation and surrender of turkish interests on the island - something that many people have lost their lives to prevent . 
  if you think that turkey would sacrifice the interests of turkish cypriots , and its strategic geopolitical interests on the islands , for the sake of an illusive eu membership that may or may not happen , i think you are mistaken . 
  well , he is technically correct . 
  the republic of cyprus ( roc ) only exists de jure , and has no de facto control of the territory north of the buffer zone . 
  additionally the claim of roc to represent the whole island is not recognized by either turkey nor the turkish cypriot community . 
   borisov 's party ( gerb ) actually won the most votes on the election anyway . 
  but they did not win a majority . 
  the other three parties that entered parliament were the socialist bsp , the ethnic dps , and the xenophobic ataka . 
  whom could they have enterred a coalition with ? 
  how can sharing information be a crime in the first place , and not run afoul of freedom of speech ? 
  i hope they will release it under an open source license . 
  actually on average turks are more afluent than both bulgarians and romanians ( in terms of gdp per capita at purchasing power parity ) . 
  if germany was n't worried about bulgaria and romania ( combined they have a population about a third of turkey 's ) , i do n't see why it would be so worried about turkey . 
   crossing the checkpoints is n't as simple as walking or driving through . 
  yeah , i guess you have to go through the major inconvenience of showing your id to a border guard of the `` pseudo '' - entity . 
  as a bulgarian citizen , there are actually still quite a lot of restrictions on where i can settle and work in europe . 
  will anybody actually go to prison ? 
  and how much did they make from the rate rigging ? 
  when the fine is smaller than the profit , breaking the laws simply becomes part of accounting for the cost of doing business . 
  depends on the context . 
  from the perspective of those who want a unitary state you could say so , but from the perspective of those who seek closer link between the north and turkey , you could say that the greek cypriots are against the freedom of free movement of people between the island and the turkish mainland . 
   , but the current situation exists today because turkey invaded turkey would not have invaded but for the eoka extremists who launched a coup against the constitutionally recognized government in cyprus lead by [ makarios ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/makarios_iii ) with the explicit aim of [ union with greece ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/enosis ) which would have involved the ethnic cleansing of the turkish cypriots . 
  given the threat that such actions posed to the order on the island , turkey not only was allowed to , but was in fact obliged to intervene , under the provisions of the [ treaty of guarantee ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_guarantee_%281960%29 ) , which specifically stated :  article iv  in the event of a breach of the provisions of the present treaty , greece , turkey and the united kingdom undertake to consult together with respect to the representations or measures necessary to ensure observance of those provisions . 
   in so far as common or concerted action may not prove possible , each of the three guaranteeing powers reserves the right to take action with the sole aim of re-establishing the state of affairs created by the present treaty . 
  unfortunately given the hostility between greeks and turks , what should have been a routine intervention to reestablish the previous order , escalated into a full blown war . 
  turkey 's mistake is that it did not try to restablish makarios as the legitimate president , but sought to create a separate turkish entity in the north . 
  i guess they thought that given how strong nationalist sentiments on both sides were , mixed coexistence in a shared geographical state would be impossible . 
   it ca n't be about territory since it 's an island which would be one country if things were resolved . 
  what are the things ? 
  it is actually mostly about territory and land ownership . 
  before the war , turks were crammed into small ghettos , and did n't own much of the land . 
  most of it was owned by greeks . 
  the turkish intervention/invasion dispossessed the greeks from their land in the north , and now they want it back . 
  an additional complicating factor is the large number of british expats who have purchased land in the north , that the greeks claim as theirs . 
  i would say that land ownership is really the major sticking point pending a resolution of the cyprus problem . 
  to try to address this issue [ the north launched a property commission ] ( http://www.tamk.gov.ct.tr/ ) in order to give some form of redress to the dispossessed greeks . 
  the greek government in the south is not happy about it , and says that it is just a propaganda move to give legitimacy to the government in the north . 
   with freedom of movement for any cypriot citizens throughout the island freedom of movement by itself is not an issue as most people can [ move freely around the island ] ( http://www.northcyprusonline.com/north-cyprus-online-checkpoint.php ) since the opening of the checkpoints in 2003 ( bar some people who settled in the north after the war and are not recognized by the south as citizens ) . 
  the issue really is the freedom to permanently settle . 
  as the economically more powerful party , if greeks were allowed to freely settle in the north , they would quickly overwhelm it and turn the turks into a minority in a unitary state dominated by them , rather than a distinct constituent people that is politically equal . 
  should have been more appropriately named western balkans 101, 
  [ azis ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9sqzltsfp8 ) ? 
   trans-adriatic pipeline but then there is also the [ ambo pipeline ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambo_pipeline ) . 
  you are a relatively small country to make such pronouncements . 
  when the big powers in the eu decide they will find a way to twist your arm to get you to withdraw your veto . 
   the issue is that they can not keep the name macedonia and ever hope to join the eu . 
  bulgaria was [ one of the first countries to recognize macedonia under its constitutional name ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_the_republic_of_macedonia#bulgaria ) , and as far as i know it has no intention of withdrawing that recognition because of the whining of some greek nationalists . 
  additionally quite a few countries , including all the permanent members of the security council except france , [ already recognize macedonia by that name ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonia_naming_dispute#naming_policies_of_foreign_countries_and_organisations ) . 
  surely you must realize that this blackmail using eu and nato membership will eventually backfire , as you can not dictate to sovereign states what they should call each other in their bilateral ties . 
  be careful for what you wish for you neighbors , for it may happen to you . 
   a rogue country that is attempting to alter and steal greek history is taken seriously because it sets a precedent of future countries stealing/deleting other nations histories for their own benefit/propaganda . 
  oh come on . 
  almost all nation states are based on myths , lies , and distortions of history , especially in the balkans . 
  i challenge you to find any two neighboring balkan countries that have compatible interpretations of the past . 
  and the whole concept of `` stealing '' history is really stupid - you can not steal something that objectively does no belong to you - history is supposed to be an objective social science that studies the past , not an asset class to be used by chauvinists for their nationalistic purposes . 
  most of the turkish guest workers in germany were `` wanted '' there as cheap labor when they first arrived . 
  wow . 
  if we ethnic [ turks in bulgaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_bulgaria ) were to do something like that we would immediately be attacked as a fifth column and traitors , and probably be set upon by the ataka hooligans . 
  autonomy has been a big taboo subject in bulgaria , and historically the bulgarian state has dealt mercilessly with any challenges to its unitary structure . 
  i wonder how they would respond since now they are part of the european union . 
  nationalism is still quite strong here , and if you were to listen to the ataka party you would be reminded of the 80s when the turks were subjected to [ a brutal assimilation campaign ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revival_process ) . 
  this is going to backfire mightily when some eu member country decides to close its labor market to bulgaria , and prevent bulgarians from working abroad . 
  given how much the country depends on remittances from europe this could be a real disaster . 
  additionally , membership of schengen can be delayed indefinitely . 
  overall , i ca n't think of anything good coming out of this . 
  it was a bad decision by a bad parliament . 
  [ you are in bulgaria !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw8dnstf3te ), 
  turkey has a customs union with europe . 
  perhaps that was the reason why it was included . 
  and just a while ago people were condemning turkey for doing the same with letters that are not part of the alphabet : http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1nw8xz/turkey_is_set_to_end_a_ban_on_several_letters_of/, 
  punishment needs to be proportionate to the crime . 
  three years for a stupid joke is too much . 
  what does this map mean in the case of the uk ?
