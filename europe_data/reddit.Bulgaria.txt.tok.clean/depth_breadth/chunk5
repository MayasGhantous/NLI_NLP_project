  clearly english is not considered a foreign language there . 
  europe needs access to middle eastern energy . 
  if turkey every shifts its foreign policy towards the shanghai cooperation organizaion , europe would be totally at the mercy of gazprom . 
  europe can not afford to completely alienate turkey . 
  why should n't they be included in the alphabet ? 
  because the current alphabet serves its purpose perfectly well . 
  for those wishing to express kurdish sounds and letters , there are already are numerous alphabets for that purpose . 
  see the wikipedia article on [ kurdish alphabets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurdish_alphabets ) . 
  by the way , does romania allow the use of hungarian letters like \u00c1 , \u00c9 , \u00d3 , \u00d6 , \u0150 to accommodate its largest minority ? 
  which alphabet exactly are you talking about ? 
  the three letters in question are not part of the turkish alphabet , and never have been . 
  the wider question here is whether citizens should be allowed to use letters that are not part of the country 's alphabet in official identity documents . 
  if the answer is yes , then this restriction transcends turkey as it holds in every single country that i know of . 
   turkey pretends to want to be a member of eu and eu pretends to give it a chance the question really is if turkey ever gets tired of this game and decides to shift into the russo-chinese camp , the negative consequences on europe would be overwhelming , especially in light of energy security . 
  as much as you dislike the countries that you have listed as undesirable neighbors they are the prime source of fossil fuels to which the west owes much of its prosperity and high living standards . 
  modern economies need oil in the same way biological organisms need food to survive . 
  europe is already vulnerable to russian gas monopoly , it is critical that the alternative routes through anatolia and the mediterranean do not fail . 
  without easy access to energy the eu would be destined to be a second rate world power always lurking in the shadow of china and america . 
  even if the european public does n't want turkey as a member , the leadership knows how critical it is from a geopolitical point of view to always keep it in european orbit . 
  why not ? 
  all of our regions want to succeed . 
  why does bulgaria have an extra shade to romania ? 
  i thought we were the same in regards to eu integration in every respect . 
  it was originally pegged to the german mark , but since that was replaced by the euro , it is now pegged to the euro . 
  so if they left `` voluntarily '' , will croatia ever allow them to return ? 
  wikileaks cables have already made it abundantly clear that us diplomatic missions are merely extensions of the american corporate lobbies abroad . 
  to judge them maybe , but to do so fairly . 
  day by day it eu double standards are becoming clearer and clearer . 
   i do n't know what the decision was grounded on graft and bribery most likely . 
  now you will have to watch out for us when you walk even in the great ones . 
  lol, 
  the far-right nationalist\u0441 ( which tend to also be russophile and of which this particular individual is a member ) support serbia and are against kosovo - they see the serbs as their orthodox slavic brethren . 
  then there are the regular right wing pro-democracy parties which are aligned with nato , and they tend to follow america 's foreign policy which is for kosovo 's independence . 
  the turks in bulgaria support kosovo because they see it as another friendly country in the balkans , and as a warning sign to those who attempt to oppress their minorities for nationalistic reasons . 
  there are some bulgarians who are opposed because they are worried it would sent a precedent with the turkish minority in bulgaria , others support it because they think it 's just punishment for the many times in history serbia has stabbed bulgaria in the back . 
  in general i would say that opinions are very mixed , and there is no consensus on the situation . 
   kardzhali i am from kardzhali myself , and i do n't think anybody is seriously considering seperatism in bulgaria . 
  geopolitically , i see no reason why bulgaria should be opposed to kosovo 's independence . 
  a strong serbia has never been in the national interest of bulgaria . . 
  it would be nice to see the macedonian flag there too . 
  i think that would be some time next year . 
  not that pathetic argument again ... 
  the lesser of two evils is simply not good enough . 
  this theory was popular in bulgaria prior to the 1944 before the country fell in the sphere of influence of `` brotherly '' russia . 
  when that happened all links to the turkic origin had to be severed . 
  today most bulgarian historians ( especially the nationalist ones ) would vigorously deny this claim . 
  they believe that the original bulgars were actually an iranic tribe , and not a turkic one . 
   bulgarians are even physically recognizable from the other groups ( as they are much lighter ) . 
  that 's not true at all . 
  there are a lot light skinned turks in bulgaria ( especially the kizilbash in the northeast ) , and there are also dark skinned bulgarians ( former prime minister [ ivan kostov ] ( http://www.bulgarica.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/ivan-kostov-parlamenta.jpg ) being an example ) . 
  it may be possible to tell turks and bulgarians apart but the differences are far more subtle and nuanced , and are n't merely based on skin color . 
  also most turks in bulgaria speak bulgarian without accent so you ca n't tell from that either . 
  a more appropriate headline would be : erdogan throws another tantrum , and threatens to cut ties with the eu . 
  turkey as a whole can not afford to cut the ties , especially the customs union , as the economic consequences of that would be devastating . 
  in this day and age , you might as well ban the user from breathing to achieve a similar result . 
  right . 
  i 'm sure it did . 
  it likely comes from the turkish word for money , which is [ para ] ( http://translate.google.com/#tr/en/para ) . 
  also 1000 lv = bon ( \u0431\u043e\u043d ), 
  you have n't seen anything yet . 
  take a look at [ \u0410\u0417\u0418\u0421 - \u041d\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043c \u0442\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u0433\u0430 ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbelvowgraq ) or [ \u0410\u0417\u0418\u0421 - \u041d\u044f\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u044a\u0434\u0435 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvu2sb_nkhs ) .

  lol, 
   i 'm not sure that he 's gay . 
  actually he is . 
  apparently , he had [ the first gay wedding in bulgaria ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuuttf2s3ke ) , though it was n't recognized by the state . 
  most believe he is not really gay , and does it only to attract attention . 
  people generally like his voice , there are n't really big fans of his extravagant video clips . 
  did you mean [ azis ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9sqzltsfp8 ) ? 
  albeit one without clothes, 
   akp will probably get tossed around at the next elections anyway i would n't be so quick to dismiss them . 
  erdogan and the akp have a large support base especially in the anatolian heartland , mostly less educated and devout people . 
  [ today hundreds of thousands of his supporters gathered in istanbul ] ( http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/police-lock-down-taksim-pm-shows-off-in-istanbul.aspx?pageid=238&amp;nid=48921&amp;newscatid=338 ) . 
  not to defend the actions of the turkish police against the gezi protesters , but i do n't think the situation in istanbul is any worse than that which occurred in athens last year ( where protesters died as well ) , or similar protests in other eu capitals . 
  to use this against turkish eu membership , when existing members engage in similar abuses , would be hypocritical . 
  give this man another nobel peace price !, 
  lol, 
  what 's that big void between bulgaria , ukraine and cyprus ? 
  elaborate . 
  what was the difference that you experienced . 
  by what standard do you judge it a deviation ? 
  if you require normal sexual activity to be strictly for procreation , then you can class a large percentage of sex between heterosexuals also as a deviation . 
  this logic is flawed . 
  sex is more than just a means of procreation , it serves also important social functions . 
  it can be used as what some perceive as a greeting , a means of forming social bonds , a means of conflict resolution , postconflict reconciliation , and sometimes even as a means of establishing dominance . 
  in that context , homosexual interactions are not a deviation , but in fact the norm , and are quite common in the animal kingdom . 
  see [ bonobo monkeys ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonobo#sexual_social_behavior ) for a concrete example . 
  rajoy : [ spain is not uganda ] ( http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18408448 ) . 
  yes , the nice old formula of privatizing the gains , and socializing the losses . 
  and that 's all that matters for our exemplary officials . 
  who cares about the long term consequences when most of them will be retired anyway . 
  really ? 
  this was n't obvious to anyone by now ? 
  a man that embarrasses the most powerful nation earth , is suddenly sought for rape right after he releases the information - clearly it must have been a coincidence , no `` fit up '' there . 
  lol, 
  [ are you sure ? 
  ] ( http://www.inhabitat.com/wp-content/uploads/lilypad4.jpg ), 
  but when things do n't quite work out , the taxpayers bail them out and take the loss . 
  there are a lot of lights in the sea between korea and japan , and also east of china . 
  i wonder if those are ships ?
