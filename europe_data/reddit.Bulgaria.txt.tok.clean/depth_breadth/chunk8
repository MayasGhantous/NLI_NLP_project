  even if the euro fails , i think the eu will survive - the free trade between member states is way too valuable to easily give up . 
  was n't this the point all along ? 
  in the past you had to use standing armies to steal the wealth and treasure of sovereign nations , today you just use complex derivatives and financial instruments . 
  of course not . 
  instead you can enjoy the depreciating turkish lira . 
  such is the beauty of fiat currencies . 
  given that serbia is essentially landlocked inside the eu , i am not really sure how well being putin 's bitch would work out for the serbs . 
  initially , i read this as `` russia to lend ** siberia ** $ 500 million , pledges support ** to ** kosovo '' . 
  i was quite bewildered . 
  for them profits are far more important than the bees . 
  as we destroy our ecosystem , eventually we will have to survive by eating money . 
   ... batak ... we did n't do that one :  it is also suggested that pomak collaborators led the 1876 massacre in the mountain village of batak , where nearly five thousand people were hacked to death or burnt alive . 
  if these reports could be proven accurate , the terms aagarjani and pomagachi ( infidels and helpers ) would be understandably appropriate .

  i hear a lot of peope complaining about multiculturalism . 
  can you elaborate what the alternatives are ? 
  do you envision forced assimilation ? 
  perhaps forced repatriation of immigrants to their homeland ? 
  if multiculturalism fails , what will replace it ? 
  it is a little known fact but hitler also exterminated the roma , as well as the gays . 
  of course , we turks are great people . 
  how can anyone complain about us ? 
  as a bulgarian turk , i 'd like to know the answer to that question as well . 
  the albanians argue that if kosovo is to be divided along ethnic lines and parts of it ceded back to serbia , then serbs must be willing to give up [ preshevo valley ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pre%c5%a1evo_valley ) which is a serbian territory with an albanian majority . 
  bulgaria does not have many economic immigrants ( yet ) , although i have n't been in the country for a while so things might have changed . 
  the two major indigenous minorities are the turks ( of which i am a member ) and the gipsies . 
  although things used to be pretty bad for the turks in the 80s with a ban on language and culture , and a forced assimilation campaign , these days i ca n't complain much - the constitution grants us the right to freely practice our language and culture , although there are still the occasional accusations of acting as a fifth column and serving the interests of a foreign country , and there is also the nationalist party ataka that routinely picks up fights with turks to bolster its credentials with the nationalist segment of society . 
  things with gipsies are quite different - they are routinely discriminated and marginalized due to stereotypes held about them - that they steal and they are up to no good . 
  such stereotypes are unfortunately held by both bulgarians and turks in the country . 
  offensive ways to refer to gypsies are `` mangal '' ( \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0430\u043b ) , some would even consider `` tsiganin '' ( \u0446\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d ) to be offensive - so the politically correct term is `` roma '' . 
  offensive terms used for turks range from `` gajal '' ( \u0433\u0430\u0434\u0436\u0430\u043b ) to `` cut-dick '' ( \u0440\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d ) , referring to circumcision which is routinely practiced among bulgarian muslims . 
  with the way the economy is going these days , most of europe will become 3rd world pretty soon . 
   mr rajoy did not spell out what additional central bank powers he had in mind likely the ability to print money in order to buy the bonds of his incompetent government . 
  what about bulgarien ? 
   required the preventive inspection of the budget perhaps he had some dirty laundry he did n't want aired ? 
  literally , `` go on dick putin ! '', 
  when everything else fails , make the germans pay for your own incompetence . 
  printing money would just lead to inflation without solving the unemployment issue . 
  governments are notoriously bad at allocating capital . 
  printing money does not create wealth . 
   complete control of the currency last time i checked the ecb is an independent body with an italian president . 
  if you want to assign blame to anyone beyond your own corrupt politicians , maybe you should direct it towards goldman sachs ( interestingly your former prime-minster [ lucas papdemous once worked for them ] ( http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/1177241-our-friends-goldman-sachs ) ) . 
  well , i guess germans have good politicians that know how to play their economic and financial cards well in order to maximize their national interests . 
  you on the other hand can only blame your own corrupt politicians for betraying you and selling your country to the highest bidder . 
   also funny coming from someone whose countries # 1 export are gypsy beggars . 
  stay classy , will you . 
  you can not be a beggar and demand respect at the same time . 
  macedonian and bulgarian are probably almost as similar as dutch and flemish , or perhaps more like swedish and norwegian . 
  guilt by association - a well known smear tactic . 
  ukip can not control who chooses to endorse them . 
  it 's a complicated question . 
  all the countries in the region have their founding historical myths , that sometimes even contradict each other . 
  depending on whom you ask you will probably get a different answer every time . 
  the bulgarian view on the matter is that the macedonian ethnicity and language do not exist , and that they are merely a part of the greater bulgarian nation . 
  the macedonian view is that bulgarians are slavisized tatars . 
  the greek view is that they are both barbarians that have usurped the macedonian name , and that they alone have an uninterrupted bloodline to the ancient macedonians . 
  greeks are a bit touchy on the subject of macedonia . 
  they deny the slavs the use of that name , and do n't like it when the name is used to refer to anything slavic . 
  i think they believe that the name is an exclusive greek trademark essentially . 
  i do not see why it is a good thing . 
  it punishes those that have been responsible with their finances , and rewards the ones that have drawn too much debt by shifting the burden away from them . 
  i think the best solution would be to split the euro along a germanic / latin boundary . 
  the fiscally conservative north will keep and maintain a stable hard neuro , whereas the profligate south will have its own inflationary seuro with a shared debt burden . 
  so now that germany has won the economic war , the time has come to rebuild the austerity battered south under german terms i suppose . 
  while most of the victims were turkish , one was a greek whom the attackers mistook for a turk . 
   the educated ones are already leaving germany and return to turkey . 
  can you elaborate on why you think this is happening ? 
  do educated turks have better prospects in turkey than in germany ? 
  i am curious about this because i was reading recently that there is a brain drain from the rest of europe towards germany , and your statement seems to contradict that view . 
   romania has no muslim influences and has the lowest number of muslims in the whole of europe . 
  there are some turks in dobrudzha . 
  there are also gagauz who are turkish speaking orthodox christians . 
  those pesky anglo-saxons and their anti-french conspiracies !, 
  the time has come for america to liberate hungary and spread some democracy . 
  [ the constitutional court of bulgaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/constitutional_court_of_bulgaria ) , which is the supreme authority on the constitution , reviewed the [ constitutionality of dps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/movement_for_rights_and_freedoms#ethnic_nature ) all the way back in '91 and declared it constitutional . 
   on 8 october 1991 , ninety-three members of bulgaria 's national assembly -- virtually all of them affiliated with the former communist party -- asked the constitutional court to declare the mrf unconstitutional citing article 11.4 of the constitution which explicitly bans political parties `` formed on ethnic , racial , and religious basis '' . 
  [ 3 ] on 21 april 1992 , the court rejected the petition and affirmed the constitutionality of the mrf . 
  [ 4 ]  even though the mrf has been legally a part of bulgarian political life since then , some bulgarian ultra-nationalists , particularly the far-right national union attack , continue to assert that it is anti-constitutional because it consists mainly of ethnic turks . 
  i am not a fan of dps either , but you ca n't just go around banning parties because of their ethnic composition , especially since nowhere in [ its charter ] ( http://www.dps.bg/about/regulations.aspx ) does dps assert that it is an ethnic party . 
  how about we start cracking down on all those expats buying up cheap properties in our countries and driving up property prices ? 
  it 's interesting that an anti-immigration party at home is backed by immigrants abroad . 
  those wealthy greeks would have never made it if they were treated abroad the way golden dawn treats foreigners in greece . 
  are you suggesting that ethnic turks in bulgaria should n't have the right to vote ? 
  tell that to the cypriots . 
  it 's much safer to keep your money in the bank , right ? 
  one of the prevailing false conventional wisdoms about the cypriot cash confiscation is that it primarily affected rich individuals . 
  increasingly it appears that the uninsured depositors on whose back the nation of cyprus was bailed out are small and medium corporations , who had been parking cash for net working capital purposes with cyprus ' banks , cash which is now gone forever to feed the creeping insolvent euro-monster , and which ca n't be used to fund such day to day business activities as payroll , purchases , and business operations . 
  when everything else fails , blame germany . 
   main intercourse is this supposed to have sexual connotations ? 
  disciplined . 
  hard-working . 
  could it also be because things that are not considered rape in most foreign countries are considered that in scandinavia ? 
  see the julian assange extradition case for one such example . 
  yes , i think at this day and age everybody should be guaranteed basic food and shelter . 
  there are pursuits in life that are greatly valuable to society and yet not readily monetizable . 
  a guaranteed minimum basic income would allow altruistic individuals to pursue them without risking starvation to death . 
  it would also allow enterpreneurs to take greater risks if they know there is a safety net they can fall on if their ideas fail . 
  i do n't think it was disturbing at all . 
  ordinary people , most of whom likely have less than 100,000 euros are unaffected . 
  the people with more money should have done due diligence when choosing their bank .
