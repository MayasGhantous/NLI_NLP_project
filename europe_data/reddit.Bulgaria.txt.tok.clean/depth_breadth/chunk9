  the first domino to fall was greece , then cyprus , and the third is now slovenia . 
  who will be next ? 
  the only problem i have with english is its spelling . 
  it needs to have a phonetic spelling in order to bridge the gap between its written and spoken forms . 
  as orlov has described very eloquently [ here ] ( http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2012/11/a-royal-pain-in-ass.html ) :  why is it that russian children , even the lazier ones , breeze along from letter blocks to war and peace without having to sacrifice any valuable snowball-tossing time , while american children , and their teachers , struggle mightily but fail to succeed ? 
  the answer is obvious : it is the fault of the fucking english !, 
  not the long-suffering english people , mind you , but of the aristocratic ponces and twits who have lorded over them for centuries , and who are responsible for contriving and perpetuating the ridiculous thing called the english `` spelling system . '' orlov has also proposed a new alphabet for the english that fully grasps its phonological features [ here ] ( http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2012/12/applied-anarchy-part-iii-design-phase.html ) . 
  it looks [ fascinating ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dmyr0uppvm4/umkltwqa6gi/aaaaaaaadeq/z0w89rnbwwe/s1600/jabberwocky.png ) . 
  when the shepherd calls wolf one time too many , people stop believing him . 
  how many times has the telegraphs announced the end of the euro already ? 
  i am sure ukip would be thrilled to accept this endorsement . 
  as long as you send him some delicious halloumi , i am sure he would be more than willing to cut the deal . 
  i really do n't understand why this is even considered . 
  what leverage could morocco possibly have over an entirely internal affair for spain ? 
  everything raises doubts about the future of the euro for the economist . 
  i do n't think the european leadership really takes into consideration what you think when it makes decisions affecting its core geopolitical interests . 
  the uk and france would never allow the eastern mediterranean to fall into the russian sphere of influence - it is too important for them , and the only thing standing between the mediterranean and russia today is turkey . 
  so you will either have to attract turkey to your side , or let it gravitate towards russia , which would effectively give russia the ability to project its power not only in the mediterranean but over the suez canal and beyond , effectively cutting you off from middle eastern energy routes and leaving you completely dependent on them for access . 
  if you guys go along with russia , i have a feeling that europe might decide to throw its weight behind turkey . 
  not sure why you are being down-voted . 
  as a native speak of bulgarian , i can confirm that what you 've said is precisely the case as i noted in my comment above . 
  because the geopolitical consequences of pissing off russia would be horrible for cyprus . 
  as a [ turkish citizen of bulgaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turks_in_bulgaria ) i do sympathize with you . 
  for decades we have also faced a virulent assimilation campaign which involved a ban on the turkish language , traditions and customs , and even forced bulgarianization of our names ( the forced conversions were started in 1985 under the so-called [ revival process ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revival_process ) ) . 
  thankfully , there has n't been much bloodshed but the psychological scars remain . 
  most of the repressive measures have been suspended after the collapse of communism in 1989 , and there have been some improvements since the country joined the eu , but there is still a very strong phobia of expanded minority rights especially among nationalist circles such as [ ataka ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_union_attack ) . 
  the accusations of the nationalists always seem to revolve around the fear that expanded cultural and linguistic rights will be a precursor to broader autonomy , and even a breakup of the state . 
  how do you usually respond to such accusations in turkey ? 
  do you envision that turkey will ever have to be split along ethnic boundaries , and if so do you think it can be done peacefully ? 
  i just discovered [ this ] ( http://www.handelsblatt.com/images/zypern_20_03_2013_2/7957654/3-format27.png ), 
  the warm embrace of mother russia - such blissfulness . 
  at this point a bank run is inevitable . 
  by bailing out cyprus you will probably just delay the inevitable by a few more weeks . 
  the only long-term solution i can foresee is implementing full-reserve banking - require banks to have 100 % deposits available at any one point in time - then no-one but the bank shareholders would be hurt by runs . 
  banks should be turned into utilities whose only purpose is to store and safeguard money , not gamble with people 's savings . 
  if by domestic german politics you mean the fact that merkel can not use german taxpayer money to bail out yet another failing bank and keep a straight face while asking germans to reelect her , i agree . 
  well , then go ahead and bail them out . 
  i 'd rather keep my money for myself . 
  really ? 
  i always though they were one and the same . 
  money and politics are intertwined . 
  and the more the media reports on this , the more we will see people burning themselves . 
  while the economic desperation in bulgaria is palpable and is the prime cause , self-immolation has never been used as a form of protest before . 
  now that more people begin to realize burning oneself is drawing public attention to their plight , i think more people are likely to engage copycat protests . 
  what is at stake here is that a precedent not be set . 
  if an exception is granted for tiny cyprus today , tomorrow spain and italy may ask for similar treatment . 
  now they are going to feel the firm imperial embrace of the bear . 
   there is no money left false . 
  the ecb can print as many euros as you want . 
  you have to just agree to let them purchase government bonds . 
  this is always what all authoritarians argue . 
  give us more power , and we will create an utopia on this earth . 
  only they end up making things worse . 
  actually all is not that bad . 
  erdogan has made positive noises about gay rights in the past . 
  see [ this ] ( http://www.kaosgl.com/page.php?id=11479 ) , for example . 
  as a turk , i do not support this . 
  i think erdogan is trying to play by putin 's book with regard to the recent adoption saga between the us and russia . 
  only in this case it is not a case of child abuse , but one of erdogan 's narrow minded cultural values . 
  i think it is time for the turkish government to begin considering granting similar adoption rights to gay couples within turkey . 
  in bulgarian , and i presume in most slavic languages , `` troika '' or '' \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430 '' means a triplet . 
  it can also mean a threesome . 
  in the past wars over resources were fought with physical weapons ; today , they are fought with financial instruments . 
  blame your own government . 
  they chose to bail out the russian oligarchs , at the expense of their own citizens . 
  the exact opposite of what had happened in iceland during their crisis in 2008 . 
  the telegraph sure hates the euro , does n't it ? 
  of course i would pull all my money . 
  but if you think this is just going to be restricted to cyprus , you are kidding yourself . 
  this is just a test run , an experiment to see how people would react to confiscation in a relatively small country . 
  if it works in cyprus , they will do it in on a much larger scale elsewhere . 
   such an uncontrolled situation would push the whole banking system into collapse with all the attendant consequences . 
  give us your money , or we will blow up the financial system . 
  i guess that 's how it feels to be blackmailed by the financial terrorists , the banksters . 
  well , at least saddam was a secular leader , now you are arming salafists who openly call for jihad against the west . 
  how is this not theft ? 
  this sounds very much like an ad for kinder . 
  muslims are nazis now ? 
  are all europeans this islamophobic or is it just you ? 
  can you please no generalize ? 
  not all muslims are homophobic . 
  this issue is being politicized by erdogan to cement his conservative credentials before his electorate . 
   they just do n't value education on the same level well , you 've basically taken in poor people from the middle of anatolia , and transplanted them into germany at a time when manual labor was in high demand . 
  before coming to europe most of these people led an agrarian rural life where education was not an important requirement for personal success . 
  most of them were probably illiterate . 
  now within the span of a generation , you expect them to develop an affinity for education . 
  these things take generations . 
  let me rephrase the question then . 
  would you be opposed to a cemetery for the turkish soldiers on shipka ? 
  so then you would see nothing wrong with a turkish memorial on shipka ? 
  did n't greece ethnically cleanse the area south of the border of slavs just prior to ww1 ? 
  i am surprised greek soldiers are even allowed cemeteries there given the bitter history . 
  a bunch of other countries would probably leave too - like spain , france , and greece , and the euro would just remain in the fiscally prudent germanic countries . 
  the countries that have left , will revert back to their national currencies , and inflate away their debts , and we will all continue to live happily ever after in a european union with free movements of goods , services , and peoples . 
   i do not want to travel to western europe anymore good riddance . 
  the time when skype will be replaced by an open source alternative which allows for full end to end encryption just ca n't come soon enough . 
  so the bank of england can deal in euro swaps , even though it is not the issuer of that currency , but banks in the continent can not ? 
  it is similar to the english - land - like in eng ** land ** , ire ** land ** , scot ** land ** . 
  the day will come when little kebab will become a big kebab . 
  soon .
