she obviously wanted the publicity . 
  she did it in front of journalists from all major media in the country , pretty much . 
  yes , she was . 
  about forming the new government . 
  there were elections a month ago and a new government will be voted possibly within a week . 
  then do n't go over bulgarian media , you will see every gory detail you never wanted to see , presented to you as enthusiastically as one can possibly imagine . 
  i really do n't see how that would be acceptable . 
  just heard an interview with the president of the hospital where she was hospitalized , he said her burns were around 90 % and her condition was basically ` incompatible with life ' . 
  also the article says there have been ` at least six ' cases of self immolation here but the number is closer to ten , actually , possibly even on the upper side of it . 
  any info about observers from bulgaria ? 
  i 'm curious . 
  i only know one lithuanian song , and i like it quite a lot , so i 'm surprised i did n't find it here : [ raudoni vakarai ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmjbseulgt8 ) . 
   by 2050 , the population of ethnic bulgarians is expected to shrink to 800,000 , while the number of bulgarian roma is expected to crest 3.5 million . 
  there are currently more than 6.1 million ethnic bulgarians living here . 
  unless there is war , famine or something way out of expectations , there is no way in hell that we 're going to shrink down to 800 thousand , these projections are utterly ridiculous . 
  this is a good collection , but in terms of pure beauty nothing beats [ polegnala e tudora ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txquvbo0oq0 ) for me . 
  also , [ oblache le byalo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azfos8zfgbu ) . 
  yeah communism had its positives and hitler built those highways too so we can not deny anything in its entirety really , can we ? 
  whatever you think , i 'm convinced that the awareness of gender equality being an issue is much higher today than let 's say 20 years ago . 
  it 's certainly not perceived as being as important as it is in more developed nations , but it is far from being ignored either . 
  regarding the * gender equality = communism * , i 'd say no , communism is a part of our past here so it is mostly seen as something backward ; gender equality is , on the other hand , one of the western values we 've started to learn about since starting eu integration so it 's a modern thing , hence the opposite of what communism is . 
  that 's the local perspective , at least , i know it might sound strange to some people .

  regarding 4 ) , i was asking about family names * other than * those in - shvili / - adze / - idze . 
  so then , more questions , how much do you pay for your internet every month , and how much is the average monthly wage in your country ? 
  a few random ones : * what is a good modern song from georgia , outside the pop genre ? 
  * share a well-known tongue twister in georgian ( + provide translation pls . ), 
  * what are your three favourite local foods ? 
  * how common are family names that do not end in - shvili , - adze or - idze ? 
  * how is your internet connection ? 
  * how do the majority of georgians regard joining the eu at some point in the future ? 
  * what is typical of english spoken with a georgian accent ? 
  * what is your favourite place to visit in your country ? 
  that should do for now . 
  the blond woman is the chairwoman of the parliament . 
  the rest of the people seen on the photo are heads of parliament factions . 
  also to be noted , the share of women in the new parliament which just started work on monday is less than 20 percent ( 45 out of 240 ) . 
  in bulgaria , except for banks , pretty much everything works everyday . 
  i feel very odd when i go to some western european country and i can not get groceries from the near store on sunday . 
  not sure about either . 
  sexy , well , especially if you 're tall and blond , i guess so . 
  but northerners are seen as rich , so they 're doing fine here overall . 
  sofia , bulgaria : transport card , all lines : 25 euro . 
  rent , 150 euro utilities , probably 40-50 euro on average ( vary a lot between summer and winter ; broadband internet not included , add 10-15 euro to that ) groceries : 100-150 euro cell phone : 10-20 euro average monthly salary would be around 400 euro i guess , but there should be something not too hard to find for at least around 700 for native speakers of english ( i know a few foreigners who work in call centers where starting pay is 750 euro/month ) . 
  we have the same thing going on here , politicians trying to twist things in such a way that southern stream bypasses eu regulations ; only they do n't really need to use such decoy as hungary 's internet tax cause no one here gives a shit anyways . 
  italy 's front tip and corsica are like some sort of homicide oases . 
  appalling efficiency , my initial suggestion . 
  also , i read somewhere in the comments here on / r/europe that the share of people with no running water in their homes in romania was something like 40 % , against 21 % in bulgaria , so that may also explain it in a way - there are more romanians living in poor conditions , hence they consume less electricity too . 
  edit : it was about people with no flushing toilets at home , 34 % romania vs 21 % bulgaria , [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2jlmxi/child_poverty_in_romania/clcvc97 ) . 
  here 's my 2 cents on this one : regarding the nuclear power plant , efficiency in energy use is rising in bulgaria , and the population is decreasing , so there will likely be no need for new such power plants for at least a decade from now , based on current projections ; furthermore , pretty much all of the neighbouring nations are building new power capacity or at least planning to , so it 's doubtful that there will be markets to export the surplus electricity produced . 
  now , regarding the gas pipeline ( the notorious south stream , that is ) , there are the following considerations : - bulgaria is badly dependent on russia for its energy ( 90 % + ) , and while south stream will certainly diversify the track , avoiding the less than stable ukraine , it , being a russian project , will by no means reduce our dependency on russia . 
  - there will certainly be some benefits from the transit of gas through bulgaria en route to the western balkans and central europe . 
  the pipeline is expected to have a negative impact on the local environment , for one thing , and that 's the main reason why the people here who oppose its construction under any conditions are against it . 
  matter of fact , i believe they represent a very small minority . 
  however , most people oppose the project because of the way that it is being carried out : there is very little transparency ( gazprom 's official met our prime-minister on the matter about a year ago and no one ever made it public what was said in that conversation ) , some attempts to bypass eu regulations etc. , and no one can really tell what exactly the benefits would be for the country because little is known about the project 's particulars at all . 
  that 's why even many people who generally believe that such a pipeline through bulgaria could be beneficial are not willing to accept the current project because of , let 's call them , political reasons . 
  ok that was 3 cents at least ; hope it did n't come out too boring . 
  we just had elections 2 weeks ago , the current government ( for the last 2 or 3 months ) is an interim one , appointed by the president and not elected by vote . 
  the previous one which resigned is probably the government that you have in mind . 
  it 's more complex than that . 
  there is certainly a significant number of communist-nostalgic , blindly pro-russian people here ; but there are also many people who think otherwise . 
  in recent months , there have been a number of strongly anti-russian positions of people in power here , most notably the president ( calling russia an aggressive and nationalistic country ) and the ministers of defense and foreign affairs ; such stances however have been few and far between in general and have provoked quite an outrage among pro-russians circles . 
  so , on the whole , we are greatly divided over the question of how to treat russia . 
  and we do n't even have a real government right now ... 
  romania wo n't make it much higher on any of theirs lists either ... 
  i 've really had it with this shit of his . 
  itt : innocent nazi jokes . 
  well , the countries which are in the green-blue specter tend to lead the yellow-to-orange ones in terms of gdp , human development index , ( low levels of ) corruption , education , infrastructure , public services , pretty much anything that quality in life can be measured in , statistically speaking . 
  then again correlation does not mean causation so maybe there 's no connection whatsoever between these things , right ? 
  treating countries as whores is not very kind now is it ? 
  why is it this difficult for putin and the people around him to grasp the concept of sovereignty , when it concerns countries other than russia ? 
  i just do n't get it . 
  i suppose i 'll have to go with communist todor zhivkov , who ruled the country for more than a third of the period ( 35 years ) . 
  25 years after he 's gone , we 're still suffering the consequences of his time in power . 
  not sure if the english translation captures it well , but the way rogozin called the minister in twitter has the connotation of something like `` some shalamanov person '' . 
  way to address the defense minister of a sovereign country , mr. rogozin . 
  we 're not ' a lackey of nato ' , we ** are ** nato . 
  and that 's not gon na change anytime soon , possibly within our lifetimes . 
  better get used to it . 
  there is too much to say on that , i 'll say briefly : they are known for rampant corruption and nepotism . 
  also , of all the vote-rigging done in bulgarian election , they are known as the one party that does it the most . 
  i agree . 
  `` kind of '' . 
  not `` major rivals '' tho . 
  i think we will probably try to beat that . 
  i have an objection to `` 4 . 
  gerb 's younger brothers '' . 
  they appear as natural allies due to the fact that both are members of the european people 's party . 
  however , most people in rb believe this is because of the extremely low hygiene of european parties when things come down to working with local parties . 
  very few rb voters have any sympathies for gerb at all . 
  this is informative but i find it somewhat hard to read . 
  i think this needs two major corrections : * alternative for bulgarian revival does not have the socialist party as a major rival . 
  it broke away from them a few months ago and is likely to vote the same on all major issues . 
  * rb is made up of 5 major parties , not 4 . 
  `` friendly to gerb '' is a serious overstatement , seeing as for most of the campaign their leaders have been bashing gerb more than anyone else - i suppose because they 're fighting for the same voters . 
  otherwise , the only way to form some kind of an at least partially stable government would be a gerb + rb coalition , which however is highly unlikely given the expected results . 
  so i really do n't expect anything definitive coming out from these elections . 
  no , in spite of making that stipulation in the beginning , you 're * still * one of these people !,
