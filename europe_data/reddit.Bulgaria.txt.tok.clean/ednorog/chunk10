  inviting putin to the wedding would be a nice gesture . 
  in summary , the word ` genocide ' was voted out as proposed by the party in power gerb ; also removed from the resolution were references to a few un conventions where the word ` genocide ' is used . 
  the article also mentions that representatives of the armenian community in bulgaria who were present in the house of parliament were happy with the resolution which was more than they had expected - an armenian bulgarian woman quoted says she did n't expect any recognition of the mass murders within her lifetime and she understands the complexity of the international situation , so she accepts the last-minute changes in phrasing . 
  every once in a while here , but i 'd say not too often . 
  wonder what 's with gambia , it 's the only sub-saharan african country with a negative growth . 
  edit : not quite the * only * one but still ... 
  filled it out . 
  feeling a little dirty just now ... [ edit ] can we see the results ? 
  i do n't feel we 're quite there yet , and not only for economy-related reasons . 
  hah , thanks , woud n't 've noticed !, 
  there is n't a single instance of ` commercial only ' ( orange ) , right - or am i just missing it ? 
  i do n't like driving . 
  yeah how about bestulgaria ? 
  no , sorry , sounds awful . 
  wtf this must be the only country in the world that loves their neighbours more than anyone else ... as someone living in the balkans , this is inconceivable !, 
  what about the / r/russia thing ? 
  damn , romania , how do you do it ? 
  uh macedonia and albania are not getting the love they deserve . 
  under the magnificent rule of our venerated ottoman masters , we should !, 
  for one , this one shows that in terms of freedom press it does n't matter if you 're slavic , greek , albanian , romanian or turkish , all of us balkan nations suck , united as one . 
  with your country putting up such a fight against corruption while our governments are doing everything possible to protect the interests of the mafia/oligarchy , i am quite convinced that it is to gradually become more and more relevant . 
  not sure about that one , i have n't been watching tv much in recent years . 
  movies , yeah , we do get some occasionally , but ca n't say there is any such movie which has been a great hit recently . 
  i remember kad porastem bicu kengur was quite popular some time ago . 
  i remember sre\u0107ni ljudi and vru\u0107 vetar , but there were at least a couple more . 
  they were immensely popular around the turn of the century , and then at some point disappeared - wonder whether it was because such series stopped being produced . 
  it goes the other way around too . 
  serbian comedy tv series were immensely popular in bulgaria when they were airing them because dialogues in serbian sound kind of funny for bulgarians even when not deliberately trying to be . 
  also they were always dubbed , never subbed , so as to retain the ` funny ' sounding . 
  probably some similar word in portuguese means something something similar but not necessarily remote in time as ` ancient ' is . 
  anyways , does n't make the post less great . 
  honestly , i am scared shitless of what russia is turning into . 
  i know there are many sane and aware people there and hope they will be able to bring the change which is needed . 
  just found out , there is a middle school here in sofia called [ adam mickiewicz ] ( http://www.15sou-sofia.com/%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d1%83%d1%87%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%89%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%be/%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d1%83%d1%89%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%be.html ) . 
  you mean , all our five tanks ? 
  seriously though , bulgarians living there were resettled and pretty much no bulgarians live in those territories now , outside of some seasonal workers perhaps ( the number of whom has been steadily declining with greek financial woes ) . 
  it has been so heavily influenced by turkish that it is often barely understandable by other slavs . 
  entirely positive , he remained venerated as one of the greatest heroes in our history , but he was rather anti-russian , a truth which was concealed and only resurfaced back after the fall of the totalitarian regime in 1989 . 
  maybe a little , for someone that knows russian . 
  but in that aspect , bulgarian seems to me a little ` messed up ' , among slavic languages - syllable stress is too often different from all other such languages , including serbian and macedonian which are the closest ones , for words which are otherwise the same or very similar . 
  different . 
  the ambassador is pretty ok , while some of the other ones have rather heavy accents . 
  what is probably most telling that they are foreigners is that they put the stress on the wrong syllable in many cases , all of them , like , for instance , they say yunak ( a brave ) rather than yunak etc. 
  wow i 'm quite surprised about the school , really . 
  so endearing !, 
  it gets added in front of the name for people who have visited jerusalem . 
  yes , none of them sounds entirely natural in bulgarian , they all speak with some accent , but they are completely understandable and i doubt anyone but linguists pays any attention to that . 
  it 's a poem , a very famous one , about fighters for liberty who die or rather , become immortal . 
  it is just directly associated with the fight for freedom from those times . 
  overall , it is a nice gesture , because , they read it in bulgarian , posing before some of the major landmarks of sofia , even wearing martenitsas on their clothes , so it 's a friendly thing , a way to show their respect for the country and the people . 
  really nice , those . 
  i visited macedonia back some 20 years ago and it was nice . 
  it 's between russia and turkey . 
  historically we 've seen much worse from russia in the late 19th/all of 20th century , but right now erdogan 's turkey is looking increasingly unfriendly too . 
  serious question to native speakers : is * bondage * completely inappropriate here ? 
  the dictionary definition i find online is ,  the state of being a slave . 
  with the following example being given :  `` the deliverance of the israelites from egypt 's bondage '' so it should n't be incorrect , even if sounding quite suggestive , should it ? 
  workin ' hard for them darwin awards are n't we ? 
  i do n't know much about international law but i believe he can be tried over the murder of litvinenko , for one ; or for war crimes in ukraine , such as downing the dutch plane , if sufficient evidence be provided . 
  we here do n't use the old slavic ones either : english | bulgarian : -- | : -- january | \u044f\u043d\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 ( yanuari ) february | \u0444\u0435\u0432\u0440\u0443\u0430\u0440\u0438 ( fevruari ) march | \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 ( mart ) april | \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b ( april ) may | \u043c\u0430\u0439 ( may ) june | \u044e\u043d\u0438 ( yuni ) july | \u044e\u043b\u0438 ( yuli ) august | \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442 ( avgust ) september | \u0441\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 ( septemvri ) october | \u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 ( oktomvri ) november | \u043d\u043e\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 ( noemvri ) december | \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 ( dekemvri ) unlike english and it seems to me most european languages , we do not capitalize names of months ( or days of the week either , for that matter ), 
  watched it live when it aired , ca n't say it 's much groundbreaking . 
  it is a novelty that senior us officials have for the first time openly stated that putin was corrupted , but everything in the video was just statements , i do n't think there was any substantial evidence that can result into bringing putin to justice ( which i surely hope will happen some day , preferably sooner than later ) . 
   a strong leader that brought russia ( back ) to worlds political agenda do n't think russia has ever been or could ever be ** off ** the world 's political agenda ; as for the ` strong ' , by demonstrating his strength , that is , by being excessively aggressive , putin brought international isolation and sanctions unto his nation and the russians are only just beginning to pay the price of this . 
  and tractors are from belarus , exaggeratedly speaking . 
  tractors to belarus huh ... that 'd be like attacking japan with a troop of samurai warriors ... 
  it certainly is infecting the washington post . 
  you mean , the magnificent colonial empire of england ? 
  continents ( mostly ) blue and oceans white is quite confusing ... 
  most likely in present-day romania , actually , i think . 
  how , appealing ... 
  heard once about some guy whose parents called him izdislav ( \u0418\u0437\u0434\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 ) . 
  it sounds like a normal slavic name , although not too common . 
  it became known however that they called him like that because they were huge fans of whitesnake and `` is this love '' was their favourite song ... 
  quite sickening , this . 
  ours seems like the most overcrowded one . 
  i think it 's beautiful , not depressing . 
  in bulgaria , i was pretty sure that would be vidin , but according to [ statistics ] ( http://www.nsi.bg/bg/content/2215/%d0%b1%d0%b2%d0%bf-%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b3%d0%b8%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%bd%d0%be-%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%be ) , it is actually silistra . 
  some pictures of it : [ 1 ] ( http://www.silistra.bg/files/snimki/silistra/14.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://www.silistra.bg/files/snimki/silistra/5.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.silistra.bg/files/snimki/silistra/6.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://www.silistra.bg/files/snimki/silistra/1.jpg ) , [ 5 ] ( http://static.mysilistra.net/albums/userpics/silistra1.jpg ) , [ 7 ] ( http://www.kvorum-silistra.info/css/news/76e170a9a1b350e0309369d20f7cddf3.jpg ) , [ 8 ] ( http://www.silistra-sega.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/11046549_789378791130908_6859525755337344931_n-300x250.jpg ) . 
  i believe the video is the one seen [ here ] ( http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/haberdetay/dusurulen-ucaktaki-rus-pilotun-fotografi-yayinlandi.htm?articleid=313319 ) . 
  [ nsfw ], 
  one of so many people who should not have died , may he rest in peace !, 
  yup , let 's all accuse and maybe start killing each other again over all wars that we had between us decades/centuries ago , that 'd be most productive . 
  yeah so diplomatic and subtle ... 
  i read sienkiewicz 's krzy\u017cacy ( the teutonic kinghts ) some time ago and i have to say i was underwhelmed . 
  i enjoy reading history novels a lot , but this one was way too romanticized , its characters idealized etc. 
  ; much like many bulgarian classics here they made us read at school about the liberation period which i never really got to enjoy . 
  yup , sums it up nicely . 
  none , we hate them all . 
  probably the same with all other balkan nations too . 
  wonder which comes first : is it that we are poor because we are intolerant , or are we intolerant because we 're poor ? 
  in any case , there seems to be quite a bit of correlation between the two . 
  what bothers me , is n't it extremely weird that such conclusion should come from an autopsy , not a ballistic investigation ? 
  also , if it was a ricochet , it apparently was not a reaction against some imminent threat , and certainly not self-defense or anything like that - is n't it only logical then that the policeman who fired the gun should be tried for manslaughter ? 
  on a side note , regarding the reaction of most people here - well , many people are celebrating the afghan 's death . 
  i find this completely unacceptable . 
  also , many people have called for awarding the policeman for his valour while performing his duties . 
  question is , why only him ? 
  there were three policemen , only difference there is , he was directly responsible for the shot , unlike the others , which was , once again , allegedly not intended . 
  so we 're in fact proposing that policeman for an award not for his bravery , but for the act of unintendedly killing a guy . 
  that 's why i am really upset by such reactions , which actually constitute the vast majority , judging by my facebook wall and news outlets ' comment sections .
