  there was a til post about it that made it to the front page a few days ago , i 'm guessing that was where you saw it . 
  pretty much any fact of bulgarian history would be widely unknown outside the country , probably except our joining the eu in 2007 . 
  but still , something one might find rather amusing , we first ** elected for a prime minister the former tsar ** who was in exile for more than five decades , thus making him probably the only monarch in modern democratic societies who was elected to power ; and then after him ** another prime minister we elected was the bodyguard of the former communist head of state before 1989 ** . 
  both of these were atrocious prime ministers ( the latter still is , presently ) and should burn in hell for the things they have done , but that is another issue . 
  however both most likely winning candidates have stated that sanctions against russia need to be removed ( one said ` reassessed ' , which is essentially the same ) , so actually our next president will never be heard making such statements as the one in the title . 
  my personal explanation : many of those graduates do jobs in call centers or some minor positions in it companies that have nothing to do with their majors . 
  but there is a huge outsourcing market here ( relative to the size of the country ) and the pay is pretty decent so many people are willing to start doing them without actually enjoying them too much . 
  here is an english [ google translation ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fclubz.bg%2f42925-imame_li_agenciq_za_borba_imigrantite_ne_no_vsichki_q_haresvat&amp;edit-text= ) . 
  and i do n't believe any country is more puppy-like shaped than us !, 
  the only bulgarian people outside the country have ever heard of anyway . 
  it 's ours , we 're the closest !, 
  also ours pls . 
  we 're like 99 % dependent on russia for energy ( not 100 % about the number , might be an overstatement but not by much for sure ) . 
  i 'm surprised there 's nothing for albania , though . 
  football wise , ca n't argue right now . 
  dude wtf , your neighbours winning it and you 're happy ? 
  this could never happen on our peninsula !, 
  saw it from a bulgarian source before that , one which i consider to be among the most reliable ones ( dnevnik.bg ) , but then searched for an english language one and only found this one . 
  ugh sorry to disappoint you but the party that won is the one that sabotagged anti-corruption reforms here . 
  also its leaders have been implicated in influencing different legal institutions but the the chief prosecutor has refused investigating into the case because he is also involved , apparently . 
  gerb maybe somewhat more pro-european than the socialists but their candidate for president also did call for ` reassessing ' eu membership . 
  in the end , both gerb and the vehemently pro-russian opposition have their roots deep back in the former totalitarian regime here , are both a part of the local political elite which kremlin is extensively corrupting , so forget any hope for any type of real progress here for the time being . 
  yeah , both were total disasters . 
  it 's spelled ` their ' . 
  damn i just got rickrolled . 
  there are actually three parties that call themselves green , two of them are pretty fake , one is a part of the yes , bulgaria coalition . 
  as for the leftists , well , things here are pretty messed up in that aspect . 
  there is the socialist party , which however is not exactly left since it works mostly to the service of some oligarchs here . 
  it states that it is left , and it has monopolized the left here , because it is big ( it is the heir to the former communist party ) , but it is certainly not left by any western standards since it is vehemently anti-refugee , anti-gay , pro-russian and conservative in the meaning that it is nostalgic for the ` good old communist times when everything was so much better ' . 
  modern left parties , there were some attempts that failed , right now they 'd probably get less than 1 % - the ` left ' here is poisoned by the socialist party . 
  so actually here the right wing ( which is pro-european , pro-reforms and to a much higher degree pro-rights ) is much more liberal than the left wing and is therefore probably much closer to what i presume you imagine when you say ` left ' . 
  and since the left-right picture here is so messed up , newer parties tend to focus on specific issues , rather than left-right axis identification . 
  uk prime minister is expected to trigger the brexit legislation on wednesday , which means the uk is to start leaving the eu officially . 
  the disintegration of the eu i guess . 
  uk prime minister is expected to trigger the brexit legislation on wednesday , which means the uk is to start leaving the eu officially . 
  no i 've only been in the uk for a total of less than 20 days in my life . 
  good for you , that 's the spirit . 
  i hope they make it through . 
  i 'm sure we 're also the best at topping negative rankings ... lowest gdp per capita , lowest income , highest corruption , worst infrastructure , most polluted air , you name it ... 
  how about this : new republic are a right-wing conservative party which is vehemently pro-eu , anti-russia , pro-reform etc. 
  they were a part of the rb in the previous parliament but withdrew after the proposal for legal reform was sabotaged by the gerb + rb + patriots majority . 
  many people expected them to form a coalition with yes , bulgaria and there is now some disappointment that such coalition has not happened . 
  they have been extremely active in social media over the last weeks and have likely gained some support over the course of the campaign , yet they are not seen as passing the 4 % barrier . 
  they were born here , and many of them left after being persecuted by the communist regime . 
  but they did have bulgarian citizenship by birth . 
  uk prime minister is expected to trigger the brexit legislation on wednesday , which means the uk is to start leaving the eu officially . 
  it 's new republic . 
  they have been very active online and gaining some ground recently , but chances are they wo n't make it over the threshold . 
  i too am a founding member and there is an overwhelming majority of people around me who are voting yes , bulgaria . 
  i know it 's just my bubble but nearly everyone among my high school and university classmates , as well as quite a few of the students i teach now will all be voting the same . 
  i find it really hard to imagine that we wo n't reach the 4 % . 
  furthermore , i voted rb last time , all predictions were for 5-7 % , they got 8.9 % in the end - not one agency was anywhere near that number . 
  so i 'm certainly quite hopeful now . 
  probably based but the only really pro-eu , anticorruption parties are da , bulgaria and new republic ( which was n't even mentioned here ) - and both are threatened to not reach the entry barrier . 
  when there was a real attempt for introducing reforms in the legal system in late 2015 , both gerb and rb sabotaged it so they can not be expected to change anything really . 
  we , on the other hand , totally love us some eu money for free . 
  not just blocking roads , also preventing people from exercising their legal voting rights . 
  according to the penal code , this is punishable by doing time in prison . 
  the thing is that , the people who organized the blockade are high-level politicians and they are well beyond the reach of any such law . 
  on the other side , such wide-scale violations as the ones erdogan committed in the wake of the coup are yet to be observed here . 
  another notable quote ,  bulgaria does not give , but also does not accept lessons on democracy , especially from countries that do not observe the rule of law after the recent exchange , i believe , our relations with turkey are probably at their lowest point for nearly a century . 
  the downside of the eu : i get so much more emotionally invested in the elections and referendums of other nations nowadays . 
  i never cared about these before . 
  anyways , hope the dutch wo n't lose their mind today , unlike what some other developed nations did recently . 
  sofia is 116th out of 231 , so there are 115 before and 115 after it in the ranking . 
  this means we right in the middle and happen to be the most representative city inhabitants on the planet , ama . 
  sounds like a perfectly normal bulgarian female family name , this . 
  mr. palmanov and mrs. palmanova ... 
  she sounds repulsive . 
  i do n't like these charts . 
  none of them . 
  more than 90 % were bulgarians , unrelated in any way to romania , i believe . 
  i was there and there was quite a number of people that i have seen in other rallies for legal reform/against corruption . 
  i was there , i think 200-300 is pretty spot on . 
  from the bottom of my heart , i envy you !, 
  i still mostly trust the nation of the u.s.a , but i have nearly zero trust for their current government . 
  i 'm afraid this is happening everywhere . 
  we have elections coming here and it 's the party which lead us into hyperinflation back in the 90s that is likely to win most votes ( not to mention that it is the party that inherited the communist party here ) . 
  in romania , people did vote overwhelmingly for a party whose head was convicted of election fraud . 
  then there were brexit , trump , and now possibly le pen coming up later this year ... for some reason , people just decide to close their eyes fore some completely obvious , completely unacceptable facts when they decide their own and everybody else 's future . 
  is this serious ? 
  i do n't really know how credible that is . 
  can someone point towards a more reputable source pls ? 
  actually , having in mind that the name europe and hence euro came from the greek evropa , we should be asking them why * they * pronounce it as ` u ' there ... / u/dyki _ tantsi , explain yourself !, 
  yup . 
  and yours seem to be among the shorter ones ha . 
  it is actually very weird , when you go high up in the dome there , and you look on the inside , you see the ground floor and people are miniature , like ants - but what really freaked me out was the realization that me and them were within the same building , in the same ` room ' , essentially , in spite of being such a great vertical distance apart . 
  chinese is full of these , and it is even more efficient , because nearly all morphemes in it are roots and bear some meaning which makes it extremely flexible . 
  some instances i can think of now , * \u888b\u9f20 dai-shu * kangaroo * ( pocket-mouse ) * \u957f\u9888\u9e7f chang-jing-lu * giraffe * ( long-neck-deer ) * \u53d1\u751f\u673a fa-sheng-ji * generator * ( happening-device ) * \u5b89\u4e50\u6b7b an-le-si * euthanasia * ( quiet-joy-death ) * \u5065\u6170\u5668 jian-wei-qi * vibrator * ( healthy-consolation-device ) * \u7535\u8111 dian-nao * computer * ( electronic-brain ) * \u538b\u8def\u673a ya-lu-ji * road roller * ( pressure-road-machine ) * \u6536\u97f3\u673a shou-yin-ji * radio * ( receive-sound-machine ) * \u6536\u94f6\u673a shou-yin-ji * cash register * ( receive-silver-machine ) there are tons and tons of these , if one cares to check . 
  it was actually one of the first nations into space . 
  oh god ... just imagine , for a minute there just , that crimea really becomes a part of eu , let 's say , tomorrow ... 
  her name is pronounced pretty much as burn-a-bitch , right ? 
  i can almost see the belgian flag forming there at the intersection . 
  i just happened to learn that in french , there is an expression for ` titjob ' , * branlette espagnole * ( literally something like ` spanish wank ' ) , and in the uk the same thing is called ` french fuck ' . 
  looks like there is a tendency to use neighbouring countires ' names to call this act since in bulgarian we call it * \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u0438\u044f * ( turska chekiya , lit . 
  turkish wank ) . 
  also , except for the obvious ` french love ' which i believe is universally accepted , we have two country-related names for sexual acts performed by three partners , * \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430 * and * \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430 * ( shvedska troyka , swedish threesome ; ruska troyka , russian threesome ) - the former is between two women and a man , the latter - between two men and a woman ; but they appear not to be too strictly differentiated . 
  so this made me curious , is there some similar situation in other european countries and their languages ?
