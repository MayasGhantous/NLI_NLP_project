  it seems like a very sad thing to me , borders being changed in the 21st century europe ... 
  is this a parody ? 
  it 's a parody , right ? 
  not even the only infringement procedure we 're dealing with these days . 
  * also on september 25 , as part of its monthly infringement package , the european commission asked bulgaria to amend its environmental legislation , sending reasoned opinions ( the second stage of infringement proceedings ) on the issue of full compliance with the water framework and drinking water directives . 
  separately , the commission asked bulgaria to abolish minimum tariffs for veterinarian services , which created market entry barriers to foreign service providers . 
  failure to act on the reasoned opinions within two months could result in bulgaria 's referral to the european court of justice . 
  * ( [ source ] ( http://sofiaglobe.com/2014/09/25/ec-opens-infringement-proceedings-against-bulgaria-over-ccb-deposits-delay/ ) ), 
  the russia-norway border is possibly the shortest one but also the one brings the greatest gain when crossed . 
  what about kosovo & montenegro , btw ? 
  in bulgaria , it is extremely popular when the men 's national team is playing . 
  otherwise , very few people care . 
  do n't believe i 've rooted for you in a single game in this tournament ( had a bet on brazil in the final ) , but you have my full respect for what you have achieved over the last decade or so . 
  yeah and i always get weirded out when something in romanian turns out to sound so slavic . 
  spot on . 
  and what does it say ? 
  oh , you ... !, 
  so i can travel there with less limitations . 
  when naming famous bulgarians , mentioning victor krum is * not * funny . 
  also , we 're not an ex-soviet country . 
  although we almost became part of the ussr at one point , voluntarily , all the more . 
  no , that 's still the same news . 
  you 're finished . 
  like , no hope at all . 
  i 'll still be rooting for you guys , tho . 
  in bulgaria , unless you enjoy getting wasted into oblivion for days on end , stay out of sunny beach . 
  in bulgaria kristalina georgieva getting the vice-president position and the budget is hailed as big news . 
  too bad this comes 3 weeks before elections and the leader of the party that proposed her , who also happens to be a major cunt , will try to reap every possible benefit from this choice and it 's gon na make the campaign here even more unbearable to watch . 
  that second picture from georgia gave me shivers . 
  de jure , de facto , statu quo , pro bono , ad hoc , ergo , post factum , persona non grata - all of these are widely used . 
  yup , spot on !, 
  though i am not completely certain about the specific regions . 
  they should have sent them over , we 're so used to eating shit here that no one would have noticed . 
  sofia : network coverage is pretty good overall , bus network really extensive , trams and trolleys a bit less so , the subway only has two lines so far but is already used by a huge number of people and is extending to become of even better use . 
  most distances can be covered with just one line change vehicle . 
  however , problems are , buses , trams and trolleys are running behind schedule too often , and there is still a large number of them that are way too old , some being produced as many as 40-50 years ago . 
  but it is probably the cheapest for a eu capital , as a single ticket costs 1 lev ( 0.5 euro ) , daily ticket 4 lv , 10 rides ticket 8 lv , monthly card for the entire network ( including smaller towns and villages around sofia ) is 50 lv . 
  i 'd even remove one of those ` a 's in there . 
  i love watching aerila videos and really enjoyed this one , plus i think it manages to hide well the problems that the city has , but if its point it to convince people it is worthy of becoming cultural capital of europe in 2019 , i 'm not sure how exactly that could work out . 
  if it 's northern sweden , then it 's probably not all that obvious ... 
  in the eyes of an eastern european , looks much more impressive than you might think , actually ... 
  did this [ panorama ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hxaslg2.jpg ) from my balcony in sofia some time ago . 
  macedonia is paying even more . 
  which is rather cruel , as they are one of the poorest nations involved in gas trade with russia . 
  the fujara sound reminds me of [ mongolian throat singing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqugtebbpi4 ) . 
  this one , i find it extremely beautiful : [ polegnala e todora ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xs5ryn_polegnala-e-todora-live-the-magic-of-bulgarian-voices-music_music ) . 
  the most famous bulgarian one however is [ izlel ye delyo haydutin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=is8kqluphkk ) which was included in the records send in space on voyager , and is a really powerful song . 
  edit : please , upvote this thread , it needs so much more love ... 
  it 's not a bad number actually , i think , certainly more than nearly everyone i know . 
  damn , you people have been doing pretty well recently with putting some corrupted politicians and oligarchs to jail . 
  i can only dream something like that starts happening here . 
  wonder how much longer russians will be putting up with all of these . 
  there is also this [ retro tram ] ( http://imgur.com/a/scfge ) in sofia which runs on special occasions . 
  i read today that exports from bulgaria of sanctioned products amounted to 4 million euro in 2013 . 
  so not much , really . 
  the bulgarian one -- picture is old . 
  i mean , we still use the same trains , only as of now they look even more decrepit . 
  like i said , consider value as well . 
  in bulgaria , the internet provider market emerged after the changes , so essentially no people from the communist regime/economy had any interference ; there were many companies , competing against each other , in a very deregulated market . 
  not saying that free market is the universal formula , but it has worked out pretty well for us here - internet service is one of the very few spheres where we are among world leaders ( it is especially good when you consider the price to quality value ) . 
  the rule of [ simeon i ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simeon_i_of_bulgaria ) . 
  that was more than 1000 years ago . 
  we 've still got some of these [ beauties ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_d7ui8eono4i/s64gntwfjgi/aaaaaaaadxc/6lq1ehrg1os/s1600/bulgarian_ikarus02.jpg ) running around in sofia . 
  ( a serbian told me this one some time ago ) a dumb bosnian , a smart bosnian , and pinocchio are travelling on a train . 
  there is a biscuit on the table . 
  the train enters a tunnel and when it comes out , the biscuit is gone . 
  q : who ate it ? 
  a : the dumb bosnian . 
  pinochio and the smart bosnian are fictional characters . 
  = = = there were a series of jokes about albanian technology back in the 80/90s . 
  such as : the albanians built a submarine . 
  only problem was , every 1 minute it had to float back on the surface of the water . 
  why ? 
  because the rowers needed some air to breathe . 
  = = = next they built a supersonic aircraft . 
  after the test flight , it was announced that a terrible accident had happened , the aircraft was destroyed , and there was one sole survivor from the crew - the coal shoveler . 
  = = = then they also built a rocket and were preparing to launch it in space . 
  however , when everything was set , the attempt failed , because the main launching rope got torn . 
  = = = on albanian tv , it was known that every evening news started with `` good evening , enver hoxha ( name of the albanian dictator ) . 
  why was that ? 
  because he was the only person in albania who had tv . 
  = = = ( i wish there were some jokes about bulgarians in this thread , eh ... ), 
  that he will . 
  that 's a good rundown , cheers !, 
  about fuckin ' time , too . 
  uhh the thing is that , this is actually used as an anti-western propaganda here ... 
  some people are taking huge pains these days to convince everyone that we should sign the south stream agreement without almost anyone even knowing what 's in there just because , you know , it 's our big orthodox slavic cyrillic-using brother who proposed it . 
  well it 's currently about eur 170 in bulgaria , so 70 % higher than here . 
  ah , now that 's pretty cultured !, 
  in bulgarian , `` polski trambesh '' is the place that sounds most backwater , it is the name of an actual town in the north part of the country . 
  the name `` trambesh '' sounds quite funny in itself . 
  also , one other toponym that is often used jocularly is romanian `` turnu magurele '' - another town not too far from the border between the two countries . 
  it also just sounds funny to the bulgarian ear . 
  also , mangalia ( coastal town in romania ) is often ridiculed , because ` mangal ' is the slur for gypsies here . 
  also , we use `` dolno nanagornishte '' as a contemtpuous appellation instead of ` some ( possibly remote , insignificant and backward ) village ' . 
  that 's because many villages here are called dolno xxx and gorno xxx , that is , lower and upper ; and ` nanagornisthe ' is ` uphill ' , so it is basically an oxymoron which means `` lower uphill '' . 
  edit : one more thing to add , for some place which is hard to find , it is often said to be `` na gaza na geografiyata '' - on ( top of ) geography 's ass . 
  ha , yeah , among older generation here , german porn seems to be the classic one too . 
  haha , the polish one is awesome ... wonder how many poles are aware of it , though . 
  indeed , ` troika ' is about the same as ` pair ' or ` couple ' in english , only it applies to three things instead of two , and is much more broadly used than ` threesome ' .
