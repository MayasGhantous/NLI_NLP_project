  umm , why do you think so , may i ask ? 
  huh so turns out ` greek ' is a thing internationally ? 
  we do n't have it here right across from them , and if there is some country associated with anal sex , that would be turkey , not greece . 
  i have been using english for pretty much all of my conscious life and i have n't heard it either , but i saw it on [ wikipedia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammary_intercourse#slang_terms ) . 
  state being overtaken by the mafia/oligarchy . 
  it is happening right now . 
  thanks for the link !, 
  i 'm shocked that bulgaria at 32 ^ nd out of 125 countries here . 
  in front of s.korea , poland , czech rep. , slovakia , croatia , the baltic countries , portugal , israel , south africa , wtf ?!, 
  it 's fucking unbearable , that 's how i feel about it . 
  but ... you must * win * ... the world cup ... ;(, 
  i 've heard about some pretty bad stuff we 've done in occupied greek villages during the wars in the first half of the 20th century . 
  also , after the first balkan war , we could n't split the gains with our allies and at one point just turned against them , attacking them and thus causing the second balkan war ( which lead to a national catastrophe , btw . ), 
  vassil levski at 1 , a 19 century icon of the fight for liberation and an absolutely idealized figure , and petar danov at 2 , which was quite a shocker - he was the leader of some esoteric spiritual movement ; he 's not that big , but apparently his followers were very active in the voting . 
  if you 're interested , the whole list is [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velikite_balgari ) ( though it 's poorly written from what i see ), 
  possibly the first one , ** khan asparuh ** , who established the country back in 681 . 
  if not , then ** simeon i ** ( 893-927 ) , during whose reign we had our golden age . 
  or , alternatively , his father ** boris i ** ( 852-889 ) , who was responsible for the christianization of bulgaria . 
  there was a ranking for the greatest bulgarians in history and these were ranked respectively 3rd , 4th and 6th . 
  everyone in bulgaria knew him for his role in `` the new statesman '' . 
  rest in peace !, 
  in bulgaria , nearly nothing is dubbed , except for kids ' movies . 
  there is still quite a notable difference with greece , though . 
  no , and no thanks . 
  i mean , there may be some places , there is a ` concept for religious education ' issued by the government , but it is extremely uncommon and i 'm sure there are very , very few people who undergo such education . 
  well we just got one politician sentenced to effective prison here - the former minister of internal affairs - but most people expect that he 'll be let off after the appeal . 
  we have had 25 years of mind-blogging corruption here , and virtually no one in important position ever held responsible . 
  ask whoever bulgarian you want and they will all tell you that politicians who deserve to go to jail for corruption for this period are in the hundreds . 
  otherwise , i would still say that the situation has become slightly better since joining the eu , but there is still an awfully long way before our legal system begins functioning at least as properly as it is in the western countries . 
  for the time being , i 'd be satisfied with even a fraction of this happening here . 
  yeah it 's encouraging but i 'll just keep my hopes down before there 's a decision on the appeal . 
  for the time being , i do n't see him effectively going to jail . 
  even if so , it would be better to have a bigger number of unreliable sources than just one , that 's the point of diversification . 
  bulgaria is already over 90 % on russia for energy . 
  south stream diversifies the route ( it goes around ukraine ) , but not the source - we need to be looking for other sources of gas . 
  furthermore , many of us here see russia as an unreliable partner and letting it increase its influence here should be avoided . 
  certainly not the way this one made it - because of people not being aware how to vote . 
  thank you so much for sharing this , hope more people will see it !, 
  uhh i 'm ok with these colors ? 
  but , dammit , why no bulgara and romania ? 
  right-centrist gerb , which sucks , but it may also be socialist ( in name only ) bsp , which sucks even worse . 
  felt nothing here , ` cept my facebook was shaking . 
  haha , well played , fellow redditor , well played ... !, 
  have any preliminary or unofficial results become known already ? 
  ours is probably one of the stiffest ` r 's out there . 
  for most foreigners it appears to be rather difficult to pronounce it . 
  i teach in two universities and tell all my students to do so . 
  i have relatives in ruse and they told me that it is a big business in their town to register cars of romanian owners from giurgiu and around as bulgarian . 
  also , know the joke , `` welcome to bulgaria , your car is already here ! '' ? 
  it should be noted , bulgaria is where quite a number of cars stolen from western europe end up - certainly much less than before joining the eu , but , still ... 
  i too would appreciate that . 
  net = contribution minus spending . 
  see germany pays 19.67 bn , receives 12.13 mn , so it nets 7.54 , which is exactly 19.67 - 12.13 . 
  now do n't be rude yo !, 
  the poles have been doing pretty well recently , compared to most of us in the former eastern block . 
  i can only wish that my country would have taken a course of political and economic development as good as theirs . 
  the source article also says that poland and the baltics are likely to become net contributors over the next decades .

  nope . 
  maybe so , but at least there 's no `` europederasty '' in russia , ha !, 
  nope , i 'm as bulgarian as it gets . 
  the matter of rights was first implied in the comment i answered to , the way i understood it . 
  are you denying my right to be pissed off that some people are burning eu 's flag while waving the soviet one ? 
  i am not really talking about pes . 
  western socialists have reacted pretty normally to the recent developments with ukraine/russia and i have no problem with that . 
  problem is , stanishev and his fellow bulgarian so-called ` socialists ' are complete and utter ruble-whores and having him as a head of a european party is a complete fuck-up . 
  sorry if this sounds a little rude , but i absolutely mean it . 
  mind you , the socialist party here was discovered this week to be following gazprom 's instructions ( there were some letters uncovered ) and trying to mend local regulations in such a way that russia 's south stream gas pipeline project is to still be built through bulgaria , even though the eu has officially given it a red light . 
  while he was n't there at the very scene of the burning , i believe him being present there and actually even heading the mass which would later celebrate at the flag being burned is fairly indicative , is n't it ? 
  better ... well . . you could say , in one way or another , but in the end it was a part of an economy which crumbled under its own weight . 
  i believe bulgaria , while never really stable politically , had quite a strong performance economically and before wwii had a pretty decent standard of living , compared to the rest of europe . 
  for what i know , in bulgaria 's case , all the funding - the local qualification and sending the performers to the host country - is organized and funded by the national television , bnt ; this year , bnt 's budget has been drastically cut , so it can not afford such expenses . 
  there is a speculation - and i suspect it is true - that the government cut the budget because there were big anti-government protests here in the summer , and the national television , for once , did n't side with those in power , but instead covered the events rather neutrally , and is now being punished for this . 
  also , household purchasing power , average per month per capita : [ table ] ( http://snag.gy/m65gi.jpg ), 
  here is the average monthly wage in bulgaria for the same period , in euro , at year 's end : [ chart ] ( http://snag.gy/qlfcl.jpg ), 
  nope . 
  viktor krumov would be it . 
  i always thought it 's more like romanians were romanic-speaking slavs , huh . 
  it kinda sucks when the most widely known person from your country is a fictional character , but , yeah , victor krum ... 
  it 's not the most ordinary thing but it does happen and it is no big deal . 
  i am bulgarian and totally not ok with how my fellow countrymen are handling this . 
  these days there were news about three families of syrian ( legal ) refugees who had rented a house in a village here ; people from the village chased them out with slogans `` bulgaria for bulgarians '' , and explained on tv that they would only accept new people in their village if they were bulgarian . 
  those three families had a total of six children and were left with nowhere to go . 
  in the meantime , nationalistic parties are widely propagating that syrians are cannibals and jihadists , and , bulgaria being such an istitutionally fucked-up country , no one is preventing them from using their hate speech on the refugees . 
  so it 's getting messier and messier here , do n't know where it will all end up - but it 's not shaping out nicely , for sure . 
  i read once some article about formation of ridiculously long words in german and the example was something that included a kangaroo and a zoo . 
  if anyone can help me find it i 'd be most grateful . 
  i have never heard of any bulgarian who migrated to the baltic countries . 
  i have heard the opposite cases , though - some baltic people now living in bulgaria ; but all such people i have heard of came here before the fall of ussr . 
  we used to have even 50 000 , as far as i remember ; prior to denomination in 1999 , that was . 
  just saying , it would be totally awesome for me to feel a part of the same community as iceland . 
  more ok than not for us , i guess ... another slavic people , not living close enough to us to hate them enough . 
  do you think 20 % vat is high ? 
  cause in bulgaria , which is otherwise one of the countries with the lowest tax rates in eu , it is also 20 % . 
  uh yeah i did n't exactly mean romania  but , still , even you are better , i believe , even if marginally so . 
  rule of law . 
  yeah there are probably people above the law , as well as corruption , in every other nation in the eu ; but nowhere else is this problem as pronounced as it is here . 
  pizza , dammit . 
  how can there be not one answer here that singles it out is beyond me .
