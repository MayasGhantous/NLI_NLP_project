  also , bulgaria was given back [ macedonia and some of northern greece ] ( http://i2.offnews.bg/events/2014/02/07/297201/1391797765_5.jpg ) . 
  april is a little early , i 'd say . 
  may is ok , june should be about perfect . 
  for hiking , i think if you come to bulgaria you wo n't regret it . 
  some instances : [ rila ] ( http://www.bghike.com/3/index.php/mountains/rila/galery/event/rila?layout=imagelist ) , [ pirin ] ( http://www.bghike.com/3/index.php/mountains/pirin/galery/event/piirin?layout=imagelist ) , stara planina a.k.a. 
  [ balkan mountain ] ( http://www.bghike.com/3/index.php/mountains/balkan/galery/event/balkan?layout=imagelist ) . 
  there are i think 8 mountains in bulgaria higher than 2000 meters , and it is a very lovely country and very versatile for its size . 
  * 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days ( romanian ) * irreversible ( french ) * the return ( russian ) these are my most favourite ones i can think of right now . 
  i also read today somewhere that bulgarian movie `` vchera '' ( yesterday ) is the highest ranked european movie on imdb ; it is a total classic here in bulgaria and everyone knows it . 
  i however am not very sure that international audience will like it all that much . 
  this map is painful to watch :(, 
  for bulgaria , that 's easy : ** vasil levski ** - that 's what probably over 99 % of bulgarians would say . 
  i 'd be perfectly fine with that ... as long as i am the monarch . 
  come to hike around bulgaria and you wo n't be sorry , i assure you . 
  can confirm . 
  in chinese , it 's pu-tao-ya \u8461\u8404\u7259 where just pu-tao \u8461\u8404 means grapes . 
  ya \u7259 means ` tooth ' . 
  so it would translate literally as ` grapetooth ' . 
  otherwise , it 's still derived from the same name , only sounds quite a bit different from the original . 
  yup , and we are the unhappiest in absolute terms ... 
  i really hope this ends up well for all those people in the square . 
  thanks ; edited in my post too , now . 
  besides , the same countries are faring pretty well in terms of [ value ] ( http://www.netindex.com/value/allcountries/ ) ( check ` cost per mbps ' ) . 
  well it 's probably a little too obvious but vienna is one of my favourite cities in europe ( been to more than a few , never visited any other places in austria , though ) . 
  ** bulgaria ** there 's been so much bitching in this subreddit recently by me and a number of other disgruntled fellow bulgarian redditors about what is going on in bulgaria that i 'm just gon na leave now , letting you enjoy some peace from us . 
  ok , i can show you some proof , what i was wrong about is that the worst inflation was not in 1996 but in early 1997 : you can see the usd/bgl back thenfrom the [ site of the bnb ] ( http://www.bnb.bg/statistics/stexternalsector/stexchangerates/sterforeigncurrencies/index.htm?downloadoper=&amp;group1=second&amp;periodstartdays=10&amp;periodstartmonths=01&amp;periodstartyear=1997&amp;periodenddays=28&amp;periodendmonths=02&amp;periodendyear=1997&amp;valutes=usd&amp;search=true&amp;showchart=true&amp;showchartbutton=true ) . 
  note , the dollar reached as much as about 2,900 bgn at one point . 
  then you can see the [ data ] ( http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9c%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%bf%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0 ) for minimum working wage where in feb 1997 it was 11,000 bgl . 
  so if you got your wage in feb , those 11,000 leva at one point became equal to $ 3.80 . 
  that i remember very well . 
  the lev became so devalued that the lowest pensions were equal to about $ 3 , and i clearly remember a tv report about a family couple back then who were both saying that their monthly salaries had become equal to $ 4 . 
  about ataka , while they never explicitly supported the government , it is absolutely obvious that without their actions it would have never come to power , and this is another thing people are disgusted with in politics - that everything happens behind the scenes . 
  i 'm very curious , can you tell me some more about that ? 
  where is your uncle from ? 
  can you say how much approximately they get paid ? 
  much obliged !, 
  sorry , i just see no middle ground between `` keep quiet '' and `` ostavka '' under the given circumstances . 
  `` keep quiet or it will only get worse '' is the best approach to raising slaves . 
  not ` whoever comes next ' ; but if any of the parties currently in parliament go to power , yes . 
  whatever happens next , it could hardly be worse than living in a mafia-run country . 
  what i 'm saying : * well , * opposed * is very mildly said , if you know anything about their rhetorics ; each of them has declared the other as the ultimate evil ; each uses the other party as a scarecrow in order to win votes among the public . 
  do n't know what what other people may think , i certainly do n't see that as moral or acceptable . 
  * about gerb and ` what comes next ' , we shall see . 
  if it 's gerb , there will be new protests , i 'm pretty sure . 
  the first and utmost priority now is , the government needs to go . 
  about that picture , i read in a source which i do n't consider reliable that it was manipulated ; it may really be manipulated , or it may not be . 
  whichever the case , that does n't change the big picture in the least . 
  ah , instability , i 'm afraid , yes . 
  especially , with the number of refugees ( mostly from syria but also africa and other regions ) growing very rapidly , xenophobic sentiments are rising , and so are extremist parties , so it 's really worrying . 
  actually , a few months ago , some of the ambassadors of eu countries ( i remember france , germany and the netherlands ) expressed their worries about what 's happening in the country in a way which was seen by many as supporting the protesters ; it is also indicative that when the french ambassador ended his term here and was sent away , he was given no honors by bulgaria ( the current government , that is ) , which was \u0430 precedent . 
  but , apart from that , no state or international orgranisation has taken an explicit position . 
  ok , here 's my view , have in mind , i am a resolute supporter of and frequent participant in these protests . 
  in short , we see the government as morally illegitimate to govern the country . 
  the longer version : it all started by the government nominating [ a media mogul ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/world/europe/after-political-appointment-in-bulgaria-rage-boils-over.html ) with widely known mafia relations for head of the national security . 
  i wo n't get into details but that was a move about as appropriate as nominating kim jong-un for head of the un . 
  that is just one , even if the most blatant , of a long series of completely unacceptable nominations which came right after the government was elected . 
  besides , the two parties which formed the government actually do not have a majority in parliament ; they have a total of 120 out of 240 mps , so their votes would be insufficient . 
  in order the government to remain in power , it relies on the nationalistic party ataka , which is an anti-european , anti-market , xenophobic , homophobic etc. 
  party which builds its campaign mostly on hatred towards the ethnic minorities in the country , chiefly the turks and the gypsies . 
  now , the most cynical thing here is , one of the two parties which form the government , the dps ( bg for movement for rights and freedoms ) , is the unofficial party of the turkic minority in the country ( unofficial , because forming parties based on ethnicities is illegal according to the constitution ) . 
  so the government , which includes the turkic minority party , is heavily dependent on the votes of a chauvinistic party which is chiefly known for its hatred to turks , among other ethnicities . 
  what 's more , about a week ago , the vice-chairman of the parliament withdrew from all public positions he was holding because it became clear that he was to be prosecuted for money-laundering and tax evasion . 
  he is the second most important person in the party in question , dps . 
  furthermore , the main party in the ruling coalition , the socialist party bsp ( which directly inherited the communist party in the early 90s ) , has a very poor history of ruling the country . 
  it brought the economy to a complete collapse in the 90s ( i remember in 1997 when due to hyperinflation many people here were living on $ 3-4 a month ! ) . 
  bsp + dps were also in power between 2005 and 2009 and there was raging corruption all over the country , which did n't get any better during the next government ( 2009-2013 ) , so people are really fed up with those parties . 
  now the prosecution against the dps head certainly is n't helping them to improve their image . 
  for the entire 24-year period of the so-called transition here ( from communism to democracy , from planned to market economy , from pro-soviet to pro-eu orientation etc. ), 
  there has been an appalling lack of justice , with people in power being closely related , sometimes heavily dependent , on the so-called ` oligarchs ' , that is , the mafia . 
  many people have grown rich illegally while a huge part of the population , especially those in the countryside , older people and people from the minorities , are living in abject poverty . 
  on the background of rampant corruption , no major public figure has been sentenced , while not a single person in the country doubts that there are many who deserve that . 
  so there has been a general anger and mistrust towards the political class , which has slowly accumulated over time and now erupted . 
  the spark was , as i said , the inappropriate nomination in question , but things here are much , much deeper . 
  and , honestly , people in the protests are so appalled and disgusted with the governing coalition that it looks pretty sure that nothing short of resignation and new elections would be acceptable . 
  for more than 5 months now there have been people in the streets every single day , by the thousand , and the protests gained new energy 3 weeks ago with the students joining in by occupying universities . 
  i do n't see this coming to an end anytime soon unless the government resigns . 
  one more thing , most people are aware that there is currently no visible alternative . 
  of the 4 parties in parliament , bsp + dps form the government , backed by ataka , and the 4th party , gerb - which is also the largest - was the one in power between 2009-2013 and has proven to be no less corrupt and incompetent than rest of them . 
  there are some smaller parties outside of the parliament , ones which support the protests and have probably gained some popularity over the recent months but that would be far from enough to be able to play an important role . 
  however , the way that i and many people here see things are that the current political class is like a tumor , and what urgently needs to be done now is to have it removed . 
  only once that is done can we start thinking about what to do next . 
  matter of fact , bulgaria was the first country to officially adopt it , and played a big role in spreading it onward throughout the slavic world . 
  i 'm not unaware . 
  ** edit : double reply , same as above ; ignore . 
  ** cyrillic alphabet came from bulgarian ; two let 's say greek brothers , one of whom called cyril , created it , based on a mixture of greek and latin ; and bulgaria was the first state to ever adopt it , back in the 9th century . 
  it was then later on adopted by russians , who made a number of adjustments and made it look the way it does now . 
  we even have a national holiday of the alphabet in bulgaria . 
  yet , from my experience , very few russians are aware of the origin of their writing system .

  no , there have n't . 
  in any case , protesters will accept nothing short of resignation , so talks would be pointless . 
  probably the most powerful [ picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yganagv.png ) i 've seen from these protests . 
  here 's what the girl on the photo commented on facebook ( translation mine ) : * among policemen , there were some well-intended ones . 
  the one whose shoulders i 'm holding had some blood on his nose , obviously he had scratched it somewhere . 
  i saw him protecting people and trying to stop policemen beating us . 
  i cried and told him to take care of himself . 
  he replied , `` hold on .
