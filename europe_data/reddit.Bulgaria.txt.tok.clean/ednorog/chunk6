  everything is going to be fine '' . 
  his eyes had tears ... *, 
  the students tried to lay siege on the parliament today , they encircled it , together with other protesters , so the police had to break the circle in order to help the mps to leave . 
  [ one here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-o2ikd9otm ) ( there are quite a few around , i may add some more later ), 
  not anymore ; there were some pretty ugly clashes today . 
  i would shyly add : * youghurt : bulgaria . 
  there are such politicians here ; but none of them currently enjoys a broad popularity , so it will be difficult struggle even after the government resigns , as it seems now . 
  tear gas , none . 
  baton , as far as i know , next to none . 
  i downvoted you because i , as someone doing 4 jobs and still finding time to go to the protests , not considering myself , my family or my friends as ` hipsters ' , do not find a government which appoints an oligarch with well-known mafia relations for head of national security and relies on the parliamentary support of an anti-european , xenophobic , fascizoid party such as ataka , to be legitimate -- certainly not from a moral point of view . 
  not really . 
  there 's the reformists ' block , which has a pro-european , pro-reform , pro-environment agenda ; it includes some right-wing to center parties plus the greens ( in bulgaria ` right-wing ' means mostly ` opposing the former communist/currently socialist party ' ) , but none of those parties is new : they all got between 0.5 % and 3 % at the recent elections in may , with 4 % required to enter the parliament , and have now united , but polls give the block about 7 % of total votes currently , which is completely insufficient to be able to change something . 
  the block has been openly supporting the protests , but protesters have been unwilling to either voice support for some party or form a new one , because , well , people here have lost their confidence in political parties as a whole . 
  here 's a recent [ overview ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/students-invoke-spirit-of-68-in-fight-to-rid-bulgaria-of-corruption-8929682.html ) from the independent . 
  the bigger one in front , * we do not recognize your transition , * * we do not recognize your authority , * * we do not recognize your property . 
  * the smaller one , with the stop sign , * `` 24 years of fake transition are enough !, 
  '' * also , there is an image of prime minister oresharski looking like a skull . 
  the idea behind it is that he is in close relations with vasil bozhkov , who used to be the richest bulgarian and is still somewhere in the very top , who is one of the widely-known * oligarchs * . 
  the nickname of bozhkov is ` cherepa ' , which means , properly , * the skull * . 
  he is an owner of a company which has won most of the contracts for highway construction over the last decade or so . 
  indeed . 
  as far as the resignation of the government is concerned , the protests have fallen of deaf ears . 
  i got that , from context ; but to my ear , it does sounds really comical . 
  not quite , this was the first wave of protests , it ended in march ; the current one , which is somewhat different , started in june and is proceeding until now . 
  the first protests were because of poverty and were caused by high electricity bills in the winter . 
  the second ones have so far been carried out chiefly by the middle class in big cities and were provoked by some political decisions of the new government which replaced the one that resigned . 
  well , they erupted in june when a mafia guy - ` oligarch ' as we call people like him - was appointed for head of the national security agency ; shortly thereafter , his candidature was retracted . 
  and that 's about it , i would say . 
  [ edit ] but then , i could also add that they have helped bring many bulgarians out of apathy and indifference which have dominated people here for years . 
  yup , [ here it is ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_against_the_oresharski_cabinet ) . 
  ** bulgaria ** * the vice chairman of parliament resigned from all public positions and has vanished from all public space . 
  it became clear that there was an ongoing investigation against him and his son for money-laundering . 
  his resignation was accepted with no debates and without him present in the parliament . 
  he has n't been seen or heard of since that ; some suspect he 's fled abroad , some even that he may have been killed . 
  * protests against the government go on , sunday marking the 150th day , the major building of the university of sofia remains occupied by students for 2nd straight week . 
  * refugee crisis is going bad to worse after an algerian stabbed a young woman in sofia ; in the meantime , there have been daily attacks against immigrants from africa or the arab countries . 
  also , a new extremist party was formed which vowed to `` clean the streets of the country from the foreign scum '' . 
  * it became clear that no record has been taken during the 4-hours long meeting of pm oresharski with a major representative of russian energy giant gazprom . 
  * ludogorets fc has surprised everyone by qualifying for the next round in europa league with 10 points out of 12 possible in 4 games . 
  as a bulgarian , i often feel privileged to live such in a funny country , but reading this i 'm getting the feeling yours might be even funnier . 
  also , the word '' \u043c\u043e\u0448\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443 '' in that article had me in stitches ( my russian is quite poor but due to the language proximity i understand as much as 80-90 % of the content ) . 
  it should be noted that today 's protest was more numerous than the other ones in recent weeks due to the fact that today marked the 24th anniversary of the fall of totalitarian/communist regime in bulgaria on nov 10th , 1989 . 
  it was announced on bnr ( the national radio ) who quoted an anonymous source . 
  the last part of the title - about his leaving the country - is not mentioned in the article ; i am yet to find a source in english , but it 's discussed widely in media here . 
  beautiful pictures . 
  never thought of b&h from this perspective , honestly , and i 'm not any proud with that . 
  related nyt article : [ bulgaria 's air is dirtiest in europe , study finds , followed by poland ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/15/business/international/bulgarias-air-is-dirtiest-in-europe-study-finds-followed-by-poland.html?_r=0 ) source : [ study ] ( http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/air-quality-in-europe-2013/at_download/file ),

  a non mafia dependent government . 
  have n't had this in many , many years . 
  well the bulgarian word for a crow is ` vrana ' , so it is n't too far either . 
  well , it 's quite the same in bulgaria , probably to a somewhat lower degree ... only , i ca n't quite say its the * only * explanation - other reasons for our low wages include low productivity , backward technology , poor government , high level of corruption , and so on and so forth . 
  since i saw [ this performance ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vkyicdn834 ) , scotland . 
  this ranking is odd , to say the least . 
  bulgaria is about even with denmark , and china is even better ? 
  also , i believe i once read something here on reddit about how many people in japan can not afford healthcare ; and then they 're ranked third . 
  i do n't know . 
  hope the [ wikipedia link ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bessarabian_bulgarians ) will suffice . 
  a few more tidbits : * i have met a few moldovans in person ( four or five , i think ) and all of them , no exception , were fluent in at least four languages ( moldovan/romanian , if we count that for one , russian , english , plus at least one other , bulgarian , polish , german etc. 
  in different cases ) * when i was in bucarest earlier this year for the first time , about 90 % of the buses at the long distance bus station were travelling to cishinau ; even though bucarest is much , much closer to bulgaria ( about than 80 km ) than to moldova - so i 'm guessing they have very strong connections . 
  * one of the biggest bulgarian minorities abroad live in moldova , we call them bessarabian bulgarians . 
  they have been there for generations . 
  there has been campaign in recent years for ` luring ' them back , and many of them have been given bulgarian passports . 
  * their club football has been doing pretty well recently , compared to , let 's say , a decade ago . 
  * and yeah , prostitutes ; from what i 've read , the number of moldovan prostitutes in western countries is disproportionately huge . 
  uhh it 's like i 'm hanging upside down ... makes me feel a little uncomfortable . 
  now this one totally [ is n't me ] ( http://snag.gy/ttaos.jpg ) . 
  damn , you people are tearing me apart , 
  huh , indeed , my mistake ... editing . 
  then , from page 126 in the same source , the bottom 10 ( best to worst ) : gr : pgroponnisos ro : sud-vest oltenia ro : centru gr : anatoliki makedonia , thraki gr : notio aigaio gr : dytiki makedonia bg : yugoiztochen ( = southeast ) gr : sterea grlada ro : sud-est bg : severozapaden ( = northwest ) i 'm surprised only 2/10 are bulgarian , honestly ; still , the severozapaden is holding the bottom position firmly and will not let go . 
  `` thank you ! '', 
  i have no information which can confirm this , but everyone would be extremely surprised if otherwise . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1ksd45/on_the_night_of_the_45th_anniversary_of_the_1968/ ) is my post from yesterday for some context .

  the only one from bulgaria that i think is n't really shite is [ undercover ( pod prikritie ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1909015/ ) . 
  i 'm not saying it 's something special and it does have its dumb moments , but i found the first 2 seasons perfectly watchable ( have n't seen the 3rd one yet ) . 
  ca n't think of anything else i would recommend . 
  actually , the people who were offended by his installation back then and the people who are offended by today 's act on the memorial are by and large the same crowd . 
  yes , a most direct one . 
  this one is , in a way , a tribute to what cerni did ; and its message is about the same . 
  it is an outcry against the communist legacy and , more directly , against the people currently in power here - because they are mostly related to the pre-89 regime . 
  some more on why i say it was vastly negative under communism . 
  well , horrendous lack of freedom for one thing , concentration camps and repressions for all who disagree with the communist party , creating a society of constant mistrust where everyone is being watched by everyone else to see if they 're suspicious ; for most of the time , you could n't migrate freely within the country , for example , if you graduate as a doctor/dentist , you can not chose where you work , you work where you 're allocated by the government ; you can not buy yourself a home anywhere you want ; if you want to buy a car , a tv set or anything like that , they put your name on a list an you had to wait for months , sometimes even years - especially for cars - before you get yours ; oh and do you think you could choose what type of car you get - forget about it , there 's some one responsible for planning the economy who chooses that for you . 
  even in places where you could chose for yourself , there was an extremely limited choice of consumer goods . 
  about what you 're saying : you can invest a lot more money than you can afford to push up your gdp ; but at some later point you have to pay the price for that . 
  that 's what i 'm saying : there was some progress , but the economic development model of planned economy was unsustainable , therefore it crashed . 
  factories were destroyed because they were inefficient and once in competition with other countries in the broader european market , with no government protection , they failed quickly . 
  and about the ` stupid leaders ' - it must be noted that since 1989 , for nearly all the time until now , power has been in the hands of pretty much the same people/circles who ruled before 1989 . 
  it started turning bad to worse and went bankrupt after the change due to the unsustainable planned economic policy . 
  it can be argued that the economy , health care and education were in a seemingly better state then ( apart from the intensive brainwashing ) but they were spending much more than could be afforded . 
  therefore , at some point , all of that collapsed . 
  also , remember , people were risking their lives to run away from bulgaria , not into it . 
  as someone born in the early 80s who has been living in bulgaria pretty much all of his life , i dare state that even with all the problems , corruption , poor government etc. , the country is presently much , much better off economically than it used to be . 
  no one denies the heavy victims the soviet army and especially the soviet people have suffered during the war . 
  however , one should be careful when saying that the ussr ` liberated ' bulgaria from fascism -- there is another version , according to which what happened was occupation , and not liberation -- and that 's how at least as many people here see things . 
  furthermore , as we all probably know , the consequences from this liberation/occupation for bulgaria in particular were vastly negative . 
  on the other hand , it may be argued , it is not less offensive to build a monument of your army in a country you have occupied .
