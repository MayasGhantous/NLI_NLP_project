  just those earthquakes ... 
  for one thing , he made it to the bbc . 
  and you can be sure , he 's far from being the only one thinking the same way . 
  the person in the picture was interviewed yesterday on one of the tv stations and said he carried stalin 's portrait because he liberated bulgaria and other nations , such as china ( ?!, 
  job security for some , and then concentration camps and repressions for others ... 
  i can understand why some people are nostalgic for communism . 
  but for stalinism ... nope . 
   if you know any south slavic langauge slovenian is completely comprehensible . 
  * replace ` completely ' with ` somewhat ' ... 
  in bulgaria , it is expected . 
  some 10 % of the price , perhaps . 
  bulgarian here . 
  here 's my explanation : we have been preparing for recycling for years . 
  in sofia and all other major cities , there have been waste containers in different colors for different types of waste . 
  there have been a number of explanation campaigns . 
  however , a recycling plant is yet to be built anywhere in the country . 
  i 'm not sure if there has even been chosen a location for one . 
  so even if we separate waste , in the end all of it is dumped in the same place and ends up not recycled . 
  just curious , how is order determined ? 
  funny how every in submission about romania or bulgaria there are comments from bulgarians and romanians , respectively , who say , no , wait , we 're even worse !, 
  always trying to outdo each other ... on a side note ,  the english version of the website also claims that the country borders `` serbia and montenegro '' to the west -- despite the fact that serbia and montenegro split up into two independent countries in 2006 . 
  =  ours seems not to have been updated since at least 2006 , so take that !, 
  ok ... so who 's the winner now !, 
  good job !, 
  i was curious how this would look too , only too busy to check everything by myself . 
  i 'm quite surprised by the irish and italians , honestly . 
  a percentage graph would be interesting to see , too . 
  nationality : bulgaria - 18 . 
  country of residence : bulgaria - 7 . 
  yup , that about sums it up ... :(, 
  take it easy , the rest of us are representative enough . 
   serbs think bulgarian is a pretty hot contender to that prestigious title . 
  wow , i was completely unaware now , thought there was no contention . 
  if serbs think so ... well i feel a little proud , honestly !, 
  well , both ireland and sweden are worse . 
  could n't have hoped for more , i guess . 
  no , actually , i think bulgaria had a huge part of its rail network electrified before most of the other european countries . 
  it 's just that a decade or so ago the government decided to purchase these diesel trains . 
  i do n't know what the decision was grounded on . 
  not well . 
  most of the trains are terribly old and rusty , 3 or 4 decades of age at least ; there have been some new diesel trains purchased since 2000 and those are much better but they are exceptions . 
  the average speed in 2012 was 47 km/h which , as far as i know , is atrocious by eu standards . 
  besides , the business model of the national railway company is totally unsustainable and there have been some debates about privatizing some parts of it . 
  yup , add a separator where the space is . 
  a fun fact about the new highway : for the last 200 km ( out of 360 ) , there is not a single toilet , gas station , restaurant or any similar infrastructure except for a few parking lots . 
  hence , [ this picture ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qansswk.jpg ) has been making rounds in facebook today . 
  the highway does n't pass quite near buzludzha , you 'll have to take a detour . 
  while around there , you could skip to [ etar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/etar_architectural-ethnographic_complex ) near gabrovo and possibly the old capital veliko tarnovo , both to the north , or if still you decide to go from buzludzha to sofia , you could stop at town-museum [ koprivshtitsa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/koprivshtitsa ) for a few hours on the way . 
  from sofia , you could head either northwest , towards the belogradchik rocks , or southwest towards the rila monastery and melnik , then possibly into greece . 
  that 's what i 'd suggest for a first-time visitor . 
  also , around burgas , you may want to check the old town of either nessebar or sozopol ( i 'm partial to the latter ) , both within 30 km of it . 
  i see ... well it 's certainly no better here . 
  that 's what both our nations are trying to change these days , i guess . 
  it is , in many - probably most - other slavic languages ; in bulgarian , though , the word for mountain is `` planina '' . 
  you 'll still be having a bumpy time when on roads close to the borders , however , for at least a few more years . 
  more than 15 swedes living permanently here ? 
  well i am at least as much confused about it as i am welcoming them  my admiration for the way you thought things through , hope you help bringing the change we need . 
  that 's right , we have built some highways and the subway of sofia mostly with the funding we have received from eu , so in that respect joining the eu has been hugely beneficial to us . 
  from the verb you used , ` blown ' , i deduce that you are not terribly happy about the spending of this money on infrastructure ? 
  if so , would you elaborate on the reasons ? 
  * gorda gora = forest gorda = proud , 
  in bulgaria , furthermore ... 
  i 'm wondering if he could be the only one here . 
  then , on the other hand , a north korean redditor is also not a very common sight , you have to agree . 
  you 're right . 
  i guess they colored it like this to show trakiya highway more clearly ; but they left the legend untouched . 
  here 's a more accurate [ map ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/bulgarian_motorway_network_en.svg/676px-bulgarian_motorway_network_en.svg.png ) . 
  ( it 's not completely accurate either , though , sofia to botevgrad has long been completed ) . 
  well , in bulgaria things are still decided mostly by people who are more or less connected to the previous communist regime ... and that 's the main reason why the protests are happening now , really . 
  lack of funding , prolongued periods of political/economic instability , corruption ... you should also be familiar , more or less ? 
  hah , do n't worry , i did n't in any way take it as mean or upsetting , just surprising , upon seeing your flair . 
  hope my retort did n't come out as rude . 
  may you enjoy it here , then !, 
  we 'd have been significantly faster if larger part of the funding had gone where it had been intended . 
  should n't that be ` we ' instead of ` you guys ' ? 
  well , check the other countries . 
  berlin and merkel are on top in most of them , surprising as i find it myself too ...

  the whole setup is a recreation of a famous picture by eug\u00e8ne delacroix , [ `` liberty leading the people '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/waywovz.png ) . 
  protests already 30 days in , today things [ went ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wjqe1dl.png ) a [ little ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3eweo3p ) bit [ wild ] ( http://i.imgur.com/9ghbz9q.png ) . 
  bulgaria ( i was at school in the 90s ) : ** emphasized : ** * all the events of history that lead to the conclusion that we are surrounded by territories which lawfully belong to us ( that includes the first and second bulgarian state , and the wars in h1 of 20th century ) ; * the suffering of bulgarians under the ottoman rule and the fight for liberation in the 1870s and the rebuilding of the nation thereafter . 
  ** barely touched or left out ** : * history of the non-western world * anything about the other balkan countries outside the conflicts we had with them * pretty much anything that happened , in bulgaria or globally , after 1945 . 
  hmm three airports in the city center ... 
  this might not work too well . 
  he 's used to be a mp from nationalist party `` ataka '' ( attack ) and i 'm sure he is strongly disliked by at least 95 % of people here . 
  as for kosovo , the country 's political position agrees with the general western stance that serbia no longer deserves to keep kosovo under its rule ; still , there is a significant number of people - possibly even more than 50 % - who are against the secession of kosovo . 
  thanks for the language remarks , note taken . 
  as for religion , i am not religious and not following things too closely , but i can tell you it 's not all that big ( nothing like what i 've seen in romania for sure ) , yet still far from negligible . 
  the country went through 45 years of communism/totalitarianism during which at first religion was repressed , then at some point the communist party installed its own proteges at the top of the clergy and became more tolerant thereafter . 
  the metropolitan mentioned here , as well as the former patriarch ( who passed away recently ) and many others were exposed as former ds agents , where ds is the bulgarian equivalent of kgb . 
  this and the fact that people from the clergy have been excessively ostentatious , driving around cars like the one here , wearing huge gold crosses etc. 
  have lead to the church as an institution losing many people 's trust . 
  and [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nwwuzefhxa ) he is , sprinkling ( not sure if this verb is correct in english here ) around holy water from his [ mega luxury lincoln ] ( http://sofiaecho.com/2011/12/16/1527171_metropolitan-transport ) . 
  i do n't mean to be disrespectful but i do n't believe this is the example that the clergy is supposed to set . 
  may he rest in peace , though !, 
  hope you detected the somewhat sarcastic tone of my post above . 
  i agree , it 's something we need to solve for ourselves . 
  but , some verbal support for the protesters from western leaders/media would have a major impact , i 'm sure . 
  today the ambassadors of france and germany here came out with a joint declaration that the government should listen to the voice of citizens and that there is no place for oligarchic models of government in the eu . 
  protesters ' reaction over facebook and twitter were nothing short of orgasmic .
