  big enough , i dare say . 
  here 's today : [ picture ] ( http://snag.gy/4mrvs.jpg ) reportedly , there were 30-50 thousand people ( i personally think it 's somewhere in the lower part of this range ) . 
  furthermore , it 's been going on for quite a long time now . 
  i guess we do n't want intervention , but we want recognition . 
  it 's our national complex , you see , as a country that does n't see itself as a very important factor , internationally , and most importantly , from the west , because this is what is now in fashion - it used to be the ussr some time ago . 
  every single article that bbc , nyt , ft etc. 
  major western outlets post about bulgaria immediately gets translated and reposted throughout all major media in the country , gratefully -- no matter if it speaks positively or negatively of the country ( the latter is much more common ) -- due to the recognition we 're being given . 
  so there . 
  write about us , and our bitching will tune down a lot more , promise !, 
  [ \u0415\u0442\u043e ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_mortality_rate#countries )  ( the right table ), 
  if that happens and another such party comes to power ( that means any of the 4 parties currently in the parliament ) , protests will resume . 
  this time people are very determined and wo n't give up easily , i 'm sure . 
  * dwarf-sized , borders france and spain * mountains all around , hence good for skiing * one of the easiest teams to beat in fifa/uefa qualifications ; all players are amateurs, 
  ** bulgaria ** same as the previous 2 weeks : 10-15 thousand people marching in peaceful protest daily , yet the protest 's demands are falling on deaf ears as the government just goes on with its business as if not taking much notice . 
  could be , but it 's still like serbian 's toddler brother . 
  what do you mean ? 
  i know , but djokovic tends to be quite an exception , do n't you think ? 
  and yes , if you travel nis to sofia , you 'll discover you miss your serbian roads once you cross the border . 
  some random observations off the top of my head : * their language is probably the richest in the world as far as obscenities go . 
  * nationalistic as all balkan nations are , they 're probably more even more nationalistic than the rest of us . 
  not sure if they 'll ever get over kosovo . 
  * in 80s bulgaria , serbian ( turbo-folk ) music was the shit , and when lepa brena came here it was the most visited concert in the country , ever . 
  after 1990 , we 've been trying to develop our own genre of serbian music , and quite successfully so . 
  * they are awesome in team sports , always get at least a couple of team medals from the olympics in basketball , volleyball , handball , water polo etc. 
  ; much less so in individual sports . 
  * some tv shows , mostly comedy ones , were hugely popular here in the 90s . 
  one reason for their comic success is that whatever one says in serbian sounds a little funny in bulgarian ( i suspect the opposite is also true ) . 
  * i really know embarrassingly little about their history , and so do most bulgarians . 
  we were taught very little history of our neighboring nations at school . 
  * there is a tangible difference in the quality of roads once you cross from serbia into bulgaria , in favor of the former . 
  * bulgarian mafia made a lot of its money off the serbian trade embargo in the 90s . 
  actually , by far the most controversial appointment was that of delyan peevski , a media mogul who together with his mother ( he is 33 years old himself ) control a huge share of bulgarian media market , and who beyond reasonable doubt is very tight with mafia circles ( here is a friendly [ photo ] ( http://www.mediapool.bg/f/uploads/images/pavlov_peevski.jpg ) of him with iliya pavlov who was a well-known mafia boss and the richest bulgarian before he got killed in 2003 ) , for head of the national security service . 
  it was the fact of his appointment that brought bulgarians in the street 11 days ago , and although it was retracted , most people are no longer willing to tolerate a government which would make such a preposterous nomination . 
  many people are comparing it to nominating kim chen-un for head of un and i do n't think that it is far-fetched at all . 
  edit : peevski is the guy on the left . 
  for bulgarian lev : kint ( \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0442 ) . 
  it 's very , very colloquial . 
  no idea where it comes from . 
  lev , on the other hand , comes from the old word for ` lion ' . 
  and i 'm envious . 
  ah , erki nool now rings a bell !, 
  about the comparison - i meant more in a way of culture , history , values , traditions and such . 
  honestly , apart from languages belonging to different families , i make little difference between estonia and the other countries in the region . 
  i have a master degree in linguistics but i 've never ever heard a better description of a phoneme . 
  wow . 
  man , that 's bad . 
  like , really , really bad . 
  and those 250 + likes ... ugh ... 
  it 's one of the more obscure european countries , and i do n't know too much , except for the language being close to finnish and ( to a lesser degree ) hungarian , that they undertook some rather courageous economic reforms which appear to have mostly worked out ( all publicly known right-wing economists here ca n't praise estonia enough for the example they 've set ) ... and that 's about it , i 'd admit . 
  edit : also , the only estonians i know of are a singer who sung `` all about the money '' sometime in the 90s , i thin\u043a , meja , and their former national football goalkeeper , mats ( spelling ? ), 
  i also remember there was an olympic gold medalist in decathlon from estonia which was really , really impressive , but i do n't remember his name . 
  i 'm curious to know , how would estonians present there country ? 
  what are the main things that a foreigner needs to know about it ? 
  how do you compare yourselves to lithuanians and latvians ? 
  what about finns ? 
  what are the biggest problems that your country is dealing with ? 
  would kindly appreciate some answers to these from locals . 
  i 'd like to hear this pronounced . 
  huh , he had a concert in bulgaria a week or two ago , where income is probably 1/3 of that in spain , and did nothing like that ... 
  furthermore , he stopped performing early , excusing himself for his allergy . 
  i did n't go to see him , but the people who did should feel very , very screwed now . 
  stressful , yet spectacular !, 
  china . 
  outside of a few major cities , public toilets are , essentially , public . 
  i remember being at the long-distance bus station in kunming , capital of yunnan province , which is by no means a minor or underdeveloped city , it had a pretty good road and public transportation system and one of the biggest airports in se asia . 
  so , in that toilet - just as in a very , very big part of public toilets around china - cabins had no doors , and walls were about knee-high . 
  so when you squat , taking a dump , ( nearly all toilets are squatting , too , hardly any toilet seats ) , everyone standing can see your ... everything . 
  furthermore , the place is pretty crowded , and when you 're the only white foreigner around , really stand out , and everyone is staring at you . 
  so there i was , squatting , pants off , urgently needing to get things done cause my bus was leaving in 5 minutes ... and a crowd of chinese onlookers curiously studying me , without even showing any sign of feeling inconvenient about it . 
  i did what i had to and even felt a little proud about overcoming my cultural inhibitions , huh . 
  uh no we do n't have anything like that . 
  too busy economically surviving . 
  huh ok i think i get it now ... 
  but still , kind of weird , it is , 
  haha , ok , bulgarian wages is self-explanatory and not surprising in the least , but i do n't quite understand what waving the bulgarian flag would mean . 
  uh , greeks should have no worries , i do n't see us * fully * recovering within way more than 20-30 years , mostly because of the `` balkan style corruption '' . 
  this is the first time i 've heard such statement , `` bulgarian perfumes are strong '' . 
  but then , those perfumes made of rose oil -- which is one of our national products -- indeed have a very strong odour , so i guess this is right . 
  true that , only it happened in london ; he was working for bbc there . 
  ahh , ideological differences ... 
  i believe i 've heard mff being called `` russian threesome '' ( ruska troyka ) but it 's far less common . 
  while the swedish variety is known to every single adult here . 
  you either mean davor suker or i do n't know what you mean at all . 
  swedes are so sexually awesome that in bulgarian , the mmf sexual configuration is called `` swedish threesome '' ( \u0448\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430 / shvedska troyka ) . 
  heeey i like !, 
  this answer . 
  never a part of ussr , however we almost did become one - the local communist party was all too willing to give away sovereignty in the 1960 , but something made them reconsider . 
  the [ incident in question ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wx0fwfpmuto ) happened this year and was not in parliament but at a party congress instead . 
  if that 's what you 're thinking about . 
  `` located mostly in thrace '' is not a very precise statement . 
  about half of thrace covers about a third of its territory . 
  check this [ map ] ( http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a4%d0%b0%d0%b9%d0%bb:thrace_and_present-day_state_borderlines-bg.png ) . 
  skiing is of good value , i hear , though i 've only done it 2 or 3 times . 
  certainly way cheaper than the rest of the eu . 
  that we did . 
  except the people who invented it were technically greek ( byzantine , to be more precise ) . 
  but bulgaria was the first state to adopt it . 
  especially if you 're from eastern germany , and live in the 80s , 
  haha , you almost nailed it ... never heard of that girl . 
  the most famous bulgarian-born celebrity i know of is nina dobrev .
