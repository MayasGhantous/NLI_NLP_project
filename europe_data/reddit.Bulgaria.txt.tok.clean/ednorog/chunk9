  yep , that 's the drama of my country . 
  the most famous bulgarian person in the world is fictional ... 
  i 'm really curious what people here would know/think about my country . 
  totally . 
  i like borussia much better . 
  however , a couple of months ago i bet on bayern winning it . 
  so i 'll be both happy and miserable either way . 
  bulgaria is a lion , you bitch !, 
  thanks to this thread , i now feel even closer to other peoples from the balkans . 
  nope , right , neo-nazi , centrist , leftist , greens , they 're all there ... no way they can all get together . 
  apparently no one is willing to cooperate with the last ruling party , gerb ; socialists and dps ( turkish minority party ) seem as natural partners , having in mind they already were in a coalition between 2005 and 2009 . 
  problem is , based on preliminary results , they 're getting about 118 or 119 seats ; they need 121 for a government . 
  the only other party in the parliament will likely be ataka - nationalistic party , which could not support a coalition with dps . 
  so there are really big chances that no government is formed and new elections take place in autumn . 
  besides , more than 25 % of votes went for parties that did n't make it above the 4 % required minimum , and in the next elections there might be a reshuffle between the parties , with some of them getting together in order to get a higher percentage . 
  but , on the whole , the next months are shaping out as very uncertain and , likely , very unstable . 
  thanks . 
  i do n't really see that happening anytime soon , though . 
  and yes , government debt has been one of our lesser problems lately , but there 's quite a bunch of others . 
  yes , that sums it up well , i believe . 
  maybe i did n't make myself clear ; in shadow economy , your business is not illegal - you 're not selling banned products , or something that you do n't have a license for etc. 
  what is not in compliance with the laws is the way that you account for your business activity . 
  btw i 'm pretty sure not all the methods used here for hiding expenses/income are violating some law , some of them are probably unethical rather than illegal . 
  no , it 's not exactly like black market . 
  in the black market , you sell or do stuff you have no right to . 
  in shadow economy , you do things which are legal ; however , you do not account for it the way that you should , for example , you declare lower staff wages in order to pay less for their social and health security , you do not declare the value of all the products you sell etc. 
  source : i 'm bulgarian , and , as the chart clearly shows , should be bloody familiar with this type of matters . 
  saw the list , with romania on top , and thought , wow , first time i 'm ever gon na see bulgaria being counted as a rich country !!!, 
  but , uh , no . 
  well , this appears to be the single most celebrated death of a person from the western world i 've ever seen on internet . 
  she was a major figure in the cold war and as i see it , my nation and the other ones which were behind the `` iron curtain '' should feel more or less indebted to her for the fall of communism across europe . 
  apart from that , i do n't know enough about her to judge , especially about her inner policy . 
  can anyone recommend a good , concise enough summary ? 
  well , if you 're generally interested in languages , bulgarian does have some fun to offer ( not unlike any other language , i guess ) . 
  also , on topic , there 's [ this video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qbcbta2-8a ) which i find kind of funny while not necessarily ` true ' . 
  bulgarian here . 
  * we * are something like a former colony , for like 500 hundred years , actually ... 
  someone got suicided again ? 
  [ mine ] ( http://www.speedtest.net/result/2594988166.png ) . 
  eur 12 per month . 
  and here 's a [ chart ] ( http://snag.gy/orvkz.jpg ) that illustrates the data for the last 3 years . 
  the name bulgaria likely comes from the volga river ; proto-bulgarians , whom i 've seen called bolgars/bulgars in english , had a state along the volga river which was destroyed by the mongols about 6 centuries after a part of them had already migrated to the balkans and formed a state there . 
  i hope he really goes to jail now . 
  i know , i know , wishful thinking ... 
  yes , * \u043f\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0442 * ( pastet ) is there in every foodstore in bulgaria . 
  what i have in mind is a story which happened some years ago , there was a cyclist who was going all around europe on his bike and when he got to bulgaria , his bicycle got stolen . 
  cases like this one probably have something to do with the fact that the poorest people of the eu live in bulgaria . 
  none in sight . 
  everyone on the media here agrees that we 're headed for a period of possibly years of political instability . 
  it is pretty much certain that no majority can be formed in the parliament within foreseeable future , so a stable government is out of question . 
  furthermore , the current government is leaving a shitload of problems behind it , and most of those require unpopular solutions . 
  i do n't really know what to expect either , and there will be huge uncertainty from now on . 
  do n't avoid bulgaria , but be careful here . 
  huh this is one of the very few rankings where bulgaria is n't last ... 
  i think it was quite popular when it came out , but in case you missed it , [ 4 months , 3 weeks and 2 days ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032846/ ) . 
  i strongly recommend it . 
  for how it sounds , italian . 
  for the expressiveness of its obscenities , serbian . 
  about 1 lv if the bill is less than 10 lv . 
  ( 5 eur ) , otherwise about 10 % . 
  tips are mostly given to waiters and taxi drivers . 
  edit : bulgaria , that is . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://petel.bg/obyaviha-kak-e-pochinal-sinat-na-prezidenta-plevneliev__122623 ) , the reason was heart failure . 
  the article says that it took 12 hours for him to pass away , and prior to that he had no known problems , which made it completely shocking to everyone . 
  i 'd say russia . 
  russian culture has a very strong influence here , especially among people born in the early 80s and before that . 
  rough translation :  * dear boyko , *   * thank you for supporting - and thus making possible - the use of the european stability mechanism in order to provide a short-term loan to greece . 
  *   * your intervention has been decisive and set a fine example for an act of real european solidarity . 
  thank you from the bottom of my heart !, 
  *   * hope to see you very soon . 
  *   * with respect , *   * jean-claude . 
  for what i know , these include 1 ) the embassies & consulates abroad , and 2 ) a polar base in antarctica . 
  no colonies tho . 
  while other european nations were getting their colonies , we were too busy being one . 
  how can we possibly be so far down in a negative eu ranking ? 
  it just does n't feel right . 
  yeah i 'm in sofia , right in that yellow zone in the lower left part of bulgaria , and have no idea what everyone here is complaining about . 
  yes , totally . 
  it 's ok , like having one and a half birthdays a year - you get a reason to throw a party , you get presents etc. 
  not everyone has a name day though , i suppose something like 30 to 40 percent of people do n't because there is no special day related to their names . 
  if you hear someone pronouncing ` food ' as ` foot ' , ` bird ' or ` berth ' as ` burt ' , ` card ' as ` cart ' etc. , that 's likely someone from bulgaria . 
  we 're not used to voiced consonants at the end of words . 
  also we do not naturally distinguish between long and short consonants . 
  hence ` sheets ' becomes ` shits ' , ` beaches ' become ` bitches ' etc. 
  but that 's not just us , many other people from southern europe tend to to that too , i think . 
  no major disasters in europe this summer so far . 
  last year at about this time there had already been many devastating floods all over the balkans ( serbia and bosnia suffered the worst , but some pretty bad ones here in bulgaria as well ) . 
  me too . 
  ednorog = unicorn . 
  * our [ tsar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simeon_saxe-coburg-gotha ) , who was exiled back in the 1940s , returned to the country and was elected for prime minister in 2001 . 
  also , he is a relative of queen elizabeth ii . 
  * our current prime minister , [ boyko borisov ] ( http://deschide.md/images/cms-image-000020048.jpg ) , used to be the bodyguard of the country 's communist dictator todor zhivkov [ back in the 80s ] ( http://blog.nazdrave.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/batboiko.jpg ) . 
  also of note , he is the [ oldest football player ] ( http://www.thestar.com.my/sport/football/2013/08/26/former-prime-minister-becomes-bulgarias-oldest-player/ ) to play in an official game for a professional football team in bulgaria ever ( possibly in europe too , not completely sure about that one ) . 
  he was once even voted player of the year but it was obviously a joke and he gave up the prize . 
  according to the article , the following message has been posted on the official website of the nova zagora municipality : '' * in view of the increasingly frequent traffic accidents leading to fatalities in the municipality , mayor nikolay grozev has ordered that 50 kg of sugar be poured over the main roads in the region . 
  this initiative this undertaken by the local government on the grounds of an ancient legend , according to which pouring sugar on roads will chase the evil away . 
  * '' tl ; dr : superstition . 
  thanks to those who responded here . 
  i do not hold the views expressed here . 
  however , i am not entirely familiar with the situation in western european cities , so i wanted to get some more input from people here .
