  huuundreds of comments , while two years ago it was normal to have like 20-30-40 comments at most . 
  and as i said - tens of new `` news '' websites - conspiracies and propaganda , it 's even obvious and not hidden . 
  articles like - `` loook at thiiiis mighty russia has laser weapons '' hurr durrrrr or `` europe is going to bankrupt '' a lot of people make fun of these websites but there are obvious paid trolls or ordinary idiots who share the propaganda and some of them probably believe it too . 
  so , i do n't mind the russians to believe whatever they want , but when the russian propaganda is shitting and polluting all over our internet it sucks . 
  one of the shit `` news '' websites : http://bradva.bg/bg other one : http://bultimes.com/ they are tens , not to say - over a hundred . 
  the same articles spread all over them . 
  i agree on that . 
  hopefully there will be a new leader with more ... serious/normal thinking . 
  the west is also pissed off because we see how the country now slooowly crawls towards some kind of cult of personality , like a modern stalinism . 
  soon if you say something in russia against putin would be considered a sin . 
   well , there was also the case with georgia against south ossetia and abkhazia , but it was a clusterfuck and everybody blames the others . 
  it was basically like that : georgia had problems with these georgian territories and the people there ( muslims , probably separatists ? ) . 
  sometimes fightings , the usual shit . 
  sends the army , fighting intensifies and russia enters with its army ( this time `` officially '' ) and now south ossetia and abkhazia are two `` countries '' so to speak . 
  but it was 8 years ago ... 
  the shocking thing with ukraine is , if you told someone 5 years ago - `` you know what , russia will enter ukrainian territories with army , they will make war and will hate each other '' they will think you 're crazy , because that could never happen . 
  and soon after - you know what happened . 
  that 's one of the reasons the neighbouring countries are ... pissed off . 
  i personally think that it 's impossible and the stupidest thing ever , for russia to send a single soldier in a country member of nato . 
  that would be a suicide for russia , one way or another . 
  of course any kind of war is with negative impact for everybody . 
  aaand ... yes ... we need warmer relations . 
  i think we 're open towards calmer relations with the west and the east . 
  our current president ( who is disliked by the pro-russian propaganda , because he 's a bit . . not a `` macho '' guy , but he 's more with the * `` duuudes , calm down , caaalm down . 
  dudes , why with all the hate , ca n't we all make love , not war . 
  '' * attitude , and he 's pro-european , so he always talks there should be peace . 
  this guy is not `` macho '' or very `` presentable '' to be a president , but he probably talks the least bullshit , in comparison with all the other our retards , who only use populism and do nothing . 
  he also has a cutie wife . 
  for example china is looking up for businesses with bulgaria and this has its perspectives . 
  ( our funny little guy president went there to talk with the businesses , he at least does something : http://bulgariachina.com/data//uploads/media/news/236/fdf4716f8a3ad66d6f2bca56d3448dd0.jpg ) we also have political parties in the parliament who are on theory pro-russian , we also have there ( for now ) the one sponsored by russia . 
  i mean - we have the `` channels '' to keep calmer relationships between all the countries . 
  as far as i remember it was all okay with medvedev , he warmed up the relations between the west and russia , but then russia went full retard : `` oh , look at that - crimea !, 
  why not send our army and pretend it 's not our army ? '', 
  aaand ... the rest is history and pissed off countries neighbouring russia . 
  i thought once about posting a topic about the bulgarian politicians and parties at the moment , but i decided is going to be too boring for everyone  there are couple of main `` bigger '' parties at the moment . 
  the strongest is gerb , with its leader considered to be boiko borisov , the present prime minister . 
  he 's considered to be from the mafia circles , but no one knows who created him , how did everything happened . 
  the party is center-right , euro-orientated , but as everything else in our politicians is ironic and fucked up - this guy was the bodyguard of our communist dictator .

  as i said , it 's only famous because the electorate is going to die soon . 
  it 's not so `` communist '' or ... do n't know ... left , or powerful , it 's just a parody . 
  it 's like a `` oh , look at these guys , they pretend it 's 1965 , how sad is that ? '', 
  photos : http://www.chudesa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/4-7_n.jpg ( we want our socialism ! ), 
  meanwhile this is , symbolically , what become of the socialism ( and not only in bulgaria ) : http://www.chudesa.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/buzludja3.jpg and the third of the bigger political parties is the `` turkish '' one ( dps ) , though the creator was an agent of the communist secret service , and the party itself does n't do anything for the poor and hard working turkish people , who most often work at the tobacco fields . 
  some say it 's sponsored by turkey ( could be true ) , and works for the turkish political interests . 
  who knows ... the party itself makes the people angry , because by the constitution it 's forbidden to have a `` ethnic '' political party . 
  it also agitates on turkish , which is also forbidden aaaand ... not cool . 
  we 're sensitive about these stuff , because of the shitty history of slavery . 
  it angers me that it `` uses '' the almost illiterate turkish people in the remote mountain villages for political purposes . 
  also - every party buys voters - mainly illiterate gypsies from the ghettos , who are voting and do n't even know for what / for whom . 
  also - we have political party sponsored by russia , which is another pornography . 
  the retard who created it used pseudo-fascist symbolism and rhetoric and now he 's sponsored by russia and he 's the biggest `` communist '' waving russian flags and shit , while being a leader of `` nationalistic '' party . 
  also - we have political parties that are here for couple of years and disappear . 
  like projects made by someone , and soon they are gone . 
  for example one journalist made a party ( with ... some mysterious money ... ) aaaand the party is gone . 
  everybody is laughing at him now . 
  it 's a huuuuuuuuuge story , about the bulgarian politics , 
  yeah like ... some kind of union . 
  also ... why not a war pact ? 
  to geeeently enter , with the armies , our own countries ? 
  :d :d :d, 
  this is the one , the party that separated from the `` main '' socialist party . 
  this guy , parvanov ( \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438 \u041f\u044a\u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 ) is an ex-president , but he 's not the candidate now ( not really sure if he has the right to be again ) . 
  do n't know the reason , may be he wanted to continue his political life or what , but he made his own party . 
  it ca n't win the elections for president and most probably will disappear on the next parliament elections . 
  and just for fun , some of the candidates : [ this guy ] ( http://novinite.bg/media/images/2014-01/photo_verybig_61584.jpg ) is a criminal , a person for hire by the polititians for propaganda and what not . 
  dumb as hell . 
  known as biser milanov `` dirt spot '' [ the peadophile ] ( http://skandalno.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/vlado_kuzov1.jpg ) and ... nsfw [ this guy ] ( http://www.nenovinite.com/img/1335179744_mito%20pishotova.jpg ) [ again ] ( http://skandalno.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mityo1.jpg ) edit . 
  you asked me what i think to do ... oh , that 's even harder question :d i have no favourite and i do n't care who will win ( the statistics show the most probable candidate '' \u0426\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0430 '' from gerb ) . 
  the irony is , that these are the first `` mandatory '' elections . 
  if we do n't go to vote and if we miss the next elections for president - they will remove us from the lists . 
  and if we want to vote again we just have to ask in our city administration . 
  oh , that 's a really hard question . 
  basically all of the candidates suck . 
  this guy is the candidate of the `` socialist party '' , but it 's not a progressive party , it 's mostly famous that the electorate is made of 90 years old communists . 
  also he 's a retard . 
  ( every person who wants to become a president and says he is going to fight `` chemtrails '' is a retard . 
  especially if he 's an ex-pilot . ) . 
  there 's also one other `` left '' candidate , from a political party that separated of the main socialist party , but he also is n't something special . 
  for example - the main `` right '' candidate ( she will most probably win ) is an ex-member of the bulgarian communist party . 
  it 's like a parody . 
  we have 21 candidates ( they were 23 , but two of them were `` disqualified '' and one of these two is a paedophile ) . 
  of these 21 there is showmen , criminal with the intellect of a dried lemon , one guy who is famous just for punching one other guy ... 
  so yeah , that 's the situation with the elections . 
  but first he promised to fight chemtrails . 
  i 'm not kidding . 
  after that we gon na send him to fight the reptilians , the martians and to search for atlantis . 
  well , imagine being suicidal alcoholic without free speech ... and on the top of that - someone fcking you in the ass . 
  `` heroes faith family russia moscow traditions '' and i 'm not sure but it 's left muscle could be saying `` putin '' :d :d :d, 
  a huge part of the world ( nato ) against russia ? 
  well , i still wonder why all of their politicians and `` businessmen '' keep sending their children to study / live in the `` bad , gay west '' . 
  that 's one of the paradoxes of the communism . 
  our retards said - `` the west is bad , it 's evil , it 's poor , it 's going to crumble '' ... aaaaand ... all of them were sending their children to the west , and only the `` more equal '' were able to travel there . 
  i have two explanations : - all of them hated their children , to send them to the `` bad evil west '' or - all of them were lying . 
  it 's the same shit today with russia . 
  oh , wow , that was unexpected !, 
  thanks !, 
  i know people here who work on assembly lines , not in the capital , and get 400 + euros net salary , which for bulgaria is pretty good . 
  also i know people working worse kind of work - paints/chemicals and so on , and they get around 500 euros . 
  so i expected them , in poland .
