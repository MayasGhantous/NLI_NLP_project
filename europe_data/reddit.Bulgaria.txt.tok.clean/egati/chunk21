  hoho , actually it 's a very interesting and long story , but i 'll try to tell it in resume . 
  this is a character of one of our greatest writers ( aleko konstantinov ) . 
  this guy is called bai ganio , which is translated something like ... ungle ganio , or ol' guy ganio . 
  he is one of the most loved/hated characters , because he represents as a parody everything we hate about ourselves . 
  he 's a symbol of self-ironizing the whole nation , the things about ourselves we laugh at , or we 're ashamed of , or ... we hate . 
  like - he is really cheap , he does n't trust anyone , he tries to do everything he can if he can , well , not to scam someone , but to win something every time and not to loose . 
  he also has bad manners , and it leads to great comedic effects in the literature and movies about him , because he travelled across europe just before 1900 ( the book is written in 1895 ) . 
  he sells rose oil , but later he becomes a politician , because he senses that this is the way to get money/stuff . 
  it 's a huge character with a lot of history and you can analyse this for hours . 
  i 'm not sure if there is an equivalent of him in other literatures . 
  he 's the `` anti-hero '' , the stereotypes that are overgraduated but we kind of love him because of it , and also we 're ashamed of them . 
  movie representation : http://bnt.bg/file/2013/05/11635.jpg and this is him with his autor : http://luboslovie.bg/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/a1d754c9e8a3.jpg ( aleko konstantinov was really well educated man who travelled all over the world . 
  he did n't do this character to ... make fun of the stereotypes . 
  it 's more like a creation made of sadness . 
  there 's also an amazing caricature - bai ganio kills his creator : http://senzacia.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/bai-ganyu-ubiva-avtora-si.jpg ), 
  we do n't have girls . 
  we 're only guys [ with hairy chests and moustaches . 
  ] ( http://us.bgaudiobooks.com/_store-us/images/thumbs/0000014_300.jpeg ), 
  exactly , bro . 
  i 'm always surprised to see russians trying to excuse what stalin did . 
  it is ... just stupid . 
  literally millions of russians were killed because of him ( and not only russians of course ) , and people are still glorifying him . 
  but ... you know - death of millions is just a statistics . 
  okay , i 'll try to do it in resume . 
   - the mentality of the people is fucked up because of it . 
  everybody was stealing whatever they can get , because it was ... the state . 
  everybody steals from the state . 
  - the mentality is also ruined because then you ca n't have your thoughts , you can have an opinion , you ca n't have a voice . 
  you should not think . 
  or you will die . 
  your family may die . 
  - the country gets fucked up , as a ... morale , thinking , spirit , everything is broken , because you ca n't be free thinker . 
  you will think whatever the state told you to think . 
  - lies and propaganda . 
  which also angers me today , because i can see how propaganda is spreaded in our online medias , but that 's another topic . 
  so , basically . 
  you see all the westerners who come to our seaside ( as like how now people go to north korea - for tourism and fun ) . 
  you see their technologies , their cars , their money , their fashion , their lifestyle . 
  and the fucking party tells you - nooo , they live bad , noooo west is evil !, 
  we live good !, 
  - again . 
  all the lies . 
  people were not equal . 
  the `` more '' equal travelled abroad , to the `` evil '' west , while the ordinary people are like in prison . 
  without freedom . 
  the communist fuckers tell you - west is evil . 
  and they go there . 
  they buy western ... everything . 
  because it 's better . 
  and they lie to you - `` we are better ! '', 
  - about the free thinking . 
  one great dissident and autor - georgi markov , was assasinated because he spoke freely in the uk about the bulgarian communist regime . 
  the famous bulgarian umbrella - used for his assassination . 
  every regime that kills you for your free thinking should be removed . 
  - ( not to talk about all the difficulties you meet if you have even a distant relative who was against the communism . 
  this is basically again about the `` more equal people '' . ), 
  - and in the end - we 're still trying to civilise our mentality , just because of this half a century communism . 
  one quick shitty photoshop later ... 
  i present to you - [ batlenin ] ( http://imgur.com/jwhpkaz ) the hero they neither deserve , neither need . 
  i 've quickly checked and it seems that 24th of december ( `` badni vecher '' ) is also called `` krachun '' in some areas of bulgaria . 
  `` koleda '' is on the 25th of december , though . 
  well , to me this sounds like inviting a wolf at your home , to fight with a rat . 
  aaand ... now i need to hear a nasheed sung by a goat . 
  it 's the absolutely same russian propaganda shit in bulgarian online medias too . 
  it 's so obvious , it 's retarded . 
  yes ? 
  i do n't speak german and do n't know if it 's mentioned , but he has a rich criminal past with robberies , thieving , hooliganism ( which means fights/beatings and shit ... ) so in a way it 's a pity such criminals are reproducing while i know a lot of hard working people without one child . 
  there are whole gypsy clans who often use these names and name their males like that , so here they are associated with gypsies . 
  i do n't think bulgarians actually use them that often . 
  but they are indeed beautiful names . 
  also - goran bregovic :d, 
  his name is indeed typical bulgarian ( but ( as you can see he does n't look anything like bulgarian ) . 
  the thing is , we have different kinds of gypsies . 
  some of them are with typical bulgarian names , some are with typical gypsy names ( zlatko , goran ... ) , some of them pretend to be turks and have turkish names ( turkish people do n't like them , because they cause trouble and say `` we 're turks ! '' ) . 
  hope this idiot get 's what he deserves !, 
  great news !!!, 
  i hope he rots in jail !, 
  do n't get him leave for bulgaria , because here he will not get justice !, 
  gypsy from bulgaria . 
  edit . 
  [ more photos of this fucker ] ( http://nova.bg/galleries/view/2016/12/15/2383/%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%bf%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8f%d1%82-%d0%be%d1%82-%d0%b1%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%82%d0%be-%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%80%d0%be-%d0%b5-26-%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%88%d0%b5%d0%bd-%d0%bc%d1%8a%d0%b6-%d0%be%d1%82-%d0%b2%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%bd%d0%b0/32287/ ), 
  they are so bloooonde and whiiite < 3, 
  and here we are , giving money for these fishes . 
  it 's kind of a tradition to eat them at the 6th of december ( saint nicholas day ) , and all the shops make them more expensive during this time of year . 
  funny how something not considered food and thrown away is eaten at some other parts of the world . 
  russia better put some sanctions on kuznetsov !, 
  i thought you 're joking , that they are going to arrest the cable . 
  and `` uzasen '' is terrible , but `` strahoten '' is awesome . 
  :d if you come to bulgaria you 'll have a lot of fun . 
  some words are different in bulgarian in comparison with the other slavic languages . 
  for example : grad - mesto zamak / krepost - hrad and something funny as a bonus for you : hlavne mesto ( capital ) - stolica, 
  when our retards drive with over 200 , while the speed limit is 90 outside of the city ( 140 on the highway ) they 're just suiciders . 
  like suicide squad but dumb and with cars . 
  :d talking about east germany ... 
  i 've watched couple of times `` good bye lenin '' . 
  great movie !, 
  this for example : http://www.lostbulgaria.com/pic3/5062.jpg it 's an old photo from pleven . 
  there are still buildings of this type , though , in the centre . 
  if we take sofia , for example , it 's growing up and the different parts were villages before , who got swallowed . 
  i agree and disagree .
