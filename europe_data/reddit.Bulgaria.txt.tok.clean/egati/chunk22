  indeed , some parts of the world needed buildings to be built because of all the demolitions during ww2 ( as some guys said here before ) - as cheap and as fast as possible . 
  it 's understandable there is lack of quality . 
  but at the same time as far as i know we did n't have that many loses of infrastructure . 
  basically we did n't have any fighting in bulgaria . 
  we had some infrastructure loses during the allied bombings mainly on sofia . 
  the reason of these panel blocks in bulgaria and probably other countries ( romania too , i 've seen documentaries about it ) , is that the party ... just decided it should move the villagers into the city . 
  there were ridiculous cases in romania ( probaby here too ) - they say to the villagers : - you are going to live in this city in this big panel block . 
  - but we do n't want to ? 
  we want to live in our cosy small village house with garden and backyard and shit . 
  - naah , you 're going to live in this panel block . 
  and they moved people to newly built blocks , sometimes without even windows or elevators , so old village folks should walk up to the 8th floor . 
  just because . 
  you 're right . 
  there 's an european program for renewing specifically these blocks . 
  to be honest , they look amazing and the people are really happy , to get their blocks to look like new .

  they get for free pvc windows , isolation and everything they could wish for . 
  on the other hand , the blocks are already at the end of their `` life '' , because i think they have a `` life '' of 50 years . 
  they are already starting to fall apart , i 'm not kidding .

  jesus , this is ridiculous . 
  even the steam condensing during the winter could cause bad effects between the floors . 
  joke aside , if you ask experienced bulgarian builders they should be able to get the floor done as it should be . 
  here every single bathroom is with such a sealed floor , because most of the people do n't have bathtubs , but take a shower . 
  the slightly older places have the floors with [ this ] ( http://www.marisanbg.com/uploads/tehnika/polagane_na_keramichni/kak_da_napravim/5/05.jpg ) which does n't let water through , and a drain typically in the middle with the floor slightly tilted towards the drain/middle . 
  oh , brother , i do n't know to laugh or to cry . 
  a friend of mine has a bathroom , where the drain is in the one end ... but the floor is tilted to the opposite end . 
  so basically you can fill up the floor with water . 
  i see ... well , if it works well it 's still fine . 
  the not so good look can be forgiven . 
  ( though in comparison i would be completely okay to live in such a building ) unfortunately our blocks were often made by inexperienced people , sometimes even by prisoners . 
  i 've heard stories how there are some places between the panels where you can basically see outside through the `` wall '' . 
  and you can listen to the neighbours talking . 
  to be honest , i live in a better , brick building . 
  the brick buildings are warmer during the winter and colder during the summer , also way more isolated , considering the noise . 
  oh , it 's really complex satire , i would say . 
  one of the details of the idiotism of the communism was the desire for unification . 
  everybody should be the same - should think the same , should look the same , should wear the same clothes . 
  women should look like that and the men should look like that . 
  different is forbidden . 
  different thinking , different talking , could ... cost your life . 
  the building should look like that - standard panel blocks ( that look like complete shit and actually are with quality like shit ) . 
  it 's basically shown how the architect wants to build something different , more ... `` interesting '' , but it 's forbidden from all the state agencies and all the bureaucracy . 
  they just let him build the standard panel block . 
  also , they 're making fun of one other idiotic thing of the communism . 
  for example , the party decided they should get the villagers out of the village , they should build entire shitty cities and they should put the villagers in the cities . 
  why ? 
  because `` party is stronk ! '' . 
  no logic , not at all . 
  so they show how these panel blocks are all over the place , no matter if there 's point in that or not . 
  hah , we would be really glad to take these `` ugly '' blocks . 
  yes , yes , yes , yes !!!!, 
  ( first - the movie is very good ! ), 
  i ca n't imagine how the soviet censorship let this movie to be shown !, 
  may be they were thinking it 's glorifying the soviet city , while it 's actually being sarcastic about it . 
  hmm ... put the architect under the guillotine . 
  you lucky bastard , you 've never had communism .

  meh , we do n't care . 
  it 's all the same shit . 
  justice is seeexy, 
  i remember i talked with some swedish guys probably 10 years ago , before our `` professional '' beggars invented the business with asking for money in sweden , so , i remember they 've told me you also have rich gypsies with big houses , but i 'm not sure what kind of criminal activities they were doing . 
  then it seemed interesting , because i thought the rich gypsies are just here and in romania . 
  yep . 
  and hungary has some gypsies , slovakia too . 
  if you give us that lady who fights corruption and puts people in the jail , i will wave the romanian flag every friday . 
  well , there was , after all , only one party . 
  imagine something like north korea . 
  :d it would not be good for your health to create a second party . 
  but i would think that for 27 years already we should be able to create new politicians , against this system . 
  also - there were a lot of great and incredibly intelligent people who were against the dictatorship , dissidents . 
  it depends . 
  the political party of this candidate ( bulgarian socialist party ) is pro-russian in means of - `` yeaah , you know what , we should remove the sanctions against russia . 
  yeah , they did stupid thing taking foreign territories , but ... we should remove the sanctions . 
  we also should see if people want to get out of nato or eu . 
  meanwhile the `` nationalistic '' parties ( sponsored by russia ^ tm hehe ) are pro-russian like that : putin is glorious leader putin is god russia stronk usa are devil reptilians from mars obama brings world war over 9000 , long live putin the best galactic imperator obama is evil burn the eu gay flags everybody in eu is gay obama is the antichrist we do n't want nuclear warz and gay reptilians stronk russia will nuclear all the west and it 's in this spirit all the time ... 
  it 's cool . 
  you can put it on your balcony or wherever you like . 
  no one will have problem with this . 
  not many people do it , though , because it 's probably weird to put the flag everywhere . 
  this is oversimplifying of the situation . 
  first of all - both candidates are ex-members of the bulgarian communist party ( dictatorship party during the communist years . ), 
  second - ironically , it seems that the `` nationalist '' parties are sponsored by russia for spreading propaganda and shit , so basically the `` nationalist '' parties are pro-russian even more than the `` socialist '' party of this guy . 
  ( that is also to some extend pro-russian ) . i mean - it would be more retarded/scary if it was some of the `` nationalists '' , who was leading . 
  third - the politics here are pure shit . 
  all the same faces , just changing parties and `` colors '' , as we often say . 
  i do n't care for both of our candidates , i dislike them both , so i 'm not going to even vote . 
  i hope if ( when ) this guy becomes the president he will continue to keep pro-european stand and wont become some puppet . 
  we will wait and see . 
  also - the president here does n't have that much power , he 's mostly a face presenting bulgaria . 
  for which - both of the candidates suck . 
  edit - it will become more `` interesting '' soon , though , because the prime minister said he 's going to resign this government if his party loses these elections . 
  during the communism in bulgaria , there was a real case , when some man got angry because of all the things that are happening , the lack of free speech , all the lies and so on ... so he made a poster with something like `` everybody should be equal '' . 
  he was arrested and as far as i remember he was killed in some communist concentration camp for political prisoners . 
  not that i 'm implying something like that will happen in russia soon . 
  but yeah ... some idiotic things are already happening . 
  i admire how some people manage to go to another country , live and work there , without knowing the language . 
  i 've been to hungary and i feel uncomfortable not knowing what 's written , what 's said and so on . 
  i just ca n't imagine myself living like that , but a lot of people do it . 
  so i guess you can say , that even a1 is enough for you to survive , because people have done it before .
