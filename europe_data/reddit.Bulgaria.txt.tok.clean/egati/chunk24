  does it mean something like `` poops '' or similar ? 
  because i think it comes with similar meaning from greek . 
  in bulgarian it 's '' \u0430\u043a\u0430\u043c '' - ( i ) poop , '' \u0430\u043a\u0430 '' ( he/she/it ) poops ps . 
  i 've done an analysis on '' \u0428\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c '' with the main character \u0410\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043a\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 and had an argument with my professor , because she said he 's also a symbol of something sacred ( his profession ) and i said that he ca n't be pointed by the author for a sacred symbol with a name like that given by purpose by the same author . 
  \u0427\u0438\u0447\u043e / \u043b\u0435\u043b\u044f for adults , let 's say ... above 30 . 
  meaning `` uncle '' and `` aunt '' . 
  for a bit younger unrelated people we have '' \u0431\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e '' and '' \u043a\u0430\u043a\u0430 '' which are translated as `` big brother '' and `` big sister '' . 
  [ i think this is pretty good .

  in the other countries the business pays the salaries to the people who work . 
  here the business pretends to pay a salary to the people who pretend to work . 
  but seriously , it 's so depressing here that all the jokes about bulgaria are dead 5 minutes after they 're created . 
  it was part of the biology classes for 8th grade ( if i remember correctly ) , which means - 15 years old . 
  it covered basically : `` this is a man . 
  this is a woman . 
  this is male 's reproductive system . 
  this is female 's reproductive system . 
  this is puberty . 
  that 's how the babies are made . 
  sperm . 
  menstruation . '', 
  all the fun . 
  also i remember we 've watched a documentary about puberty , sex , embryo , giving birth . 
  i think we had seen how a baby is born , but it was a looong time ago , so not completely sure . 
  i were sexually educated a bit earlier , probably at 13 . 
  it really depends what youy mean `` educated '' though . 
  but yeah , i knew how the babies are made and everything . 
  though i have never had `` the talk '' with my parents . 
  it would be awkward . 
  we talked about it even without any encouragement . 
  hehehe . 
  well , i do n't know . 
  but i find it weird how some countries are reeeeally conservative about it . 
  which is ironic , because we are conservative about other things - i ca n't imagine myself naked with other people in a sauna as the scandinavians do . 
  let alone relatives . 
  no way . 
  what the hell ? 
  that 's almost impossible . 
  only if you live in sofia and get 3500 leva net salary and somehow manage to spend only 350 leva for rent . 
  even in the best case scenario , in sofia , if someone gets around 1000 leva he can pay around 30 % for the rent . 
  we 're kinda good at it ( at least in comparison with other sports ) , so i would say it 's above average in popularity . 
  damn , til that this is called `` ampersand '' in bulgarian . 
  thank you . 
  hah , just saw that one estonian guy had the exact same revelation .

  what 's funny : at fist i was [ like ] ( http://www.novini.bg/uploads/news_pictures/2012-27/big/ataka-vdiga-miting-sreshtu-skypiq-tok-79967.jpg ) but then i was [ like ] ( http://www.vestnikataka.bg/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/img_0280-1024x682.jpg ), 
  it 's a funny topic . 
  we have kind of three right wing parties . 
  the first one is sponsored by russia and at first , when it was created , pretended to be kinda national-socialist , but since it started waving russian flags it suddenly become communist . 
  kobzon singing songs , the fucker who 's the leader of the party hating eu , nato and so on and getting nostalgia for the socialist times ... shit like that . 
  the second one is like `` hurr durr macedonia is ours , we patriots ! '', 
  the third one is the same shit like the previous two . 
  the leader saw that it 's an easy way to make money so he created `` nationalist '' party to exploit the people . 
  so , it 's funny , because an year ago the relations were like : leader1 to leader3 - you 're evil and stupid !, 
  you distributed gay porn !, 
  you should be in prison !, 
  you 're from the mafia !, 
  leader3 to leader1 - you 're a dwarf !, 
  you 're stupid !, 
  you suck !, 
  meanwhile their political parties would n't get into the parliament , because they would n't get even 5 percent . 
  i think 3-4 at most . 
  because their leaders are complete retards . 
  suddenly - leader1 , leader2 and leader3 at a table . 
  `` we best friends now !, 
  we love each other !, 
  bulgaria stronk ! '', 
  because the fuckers realised the only way to keep stealing and keep being in politics is to create a coalition and to hope for getting at least 5 percent combined . 
  also - waving of russian flags and propaganda intensifies . 
  leader2 joins helping the pro-russian propaganda participating in a russian anti-bulgarian and anti-eu propaganda movie . 
  in my opinion - fuck these fuckers . 
  you ca n't say you 're nationalist while waving flags of a country , that 's attacking our own country , by attacking our medias with massive propaganda . 
  actually the problems are way deeper but it 's a long story . 
  ivan georgiev or georgi ivanov or georgi petrov , for example . 
  the most popular male names are georgi , ivan , dimitar , petar , nikolai , hristo , and some of the most popular female names are maria , elena , desislava , gergana ... 
  `` what 's hap ` nin ? '', 
  or `` how are you ? '', 
  the most common is `` allo ? '', 
  or just `` da ? '', 
  ( yes ? 
  so , you want to say that sweden 's cities are still completely clean and the immigrants do n't throw trash and do n't make parts of the cities dirty ? 
  nope . 
  you should go full simo hayha on their asses . 
  hehe , good choice !, 
  actually my first thought was also about zaz : [ zaz - la pluie ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja3odiynpku ), 
  we have a disinformation campaign sponsored by russia all over the internet . 
  hate for the eu , hate for the usa and so on . 
  i 've heard some germans were working for nasa . 
  he-he-he . 
  they do n't threaten us directly , but kind of with their propaganda in our medias . 
  you can see stuff in the comments under different articles like : `` oh , there are american soldiers in bulgaria !, 
  wait and see when russia destroys us with nuclear weapon !, 
  i do n't want nato in bulgaria ! '', 
  `` russia is so great and if nato is going near it russia will destroy us ! '', 
  also `` nato will get us in ww3 !, 
  i do n't want war with russia ! '', 
  and shit like that . 
  especially the last one was one of the main propaganda points of the `` nationalist '' political party that 's bought by russia . 
  moussaka . 
  in bulgaria - i would n't say so .
