  i mean , this life style is so different than the western one . 
  for example ... imagine - tvs . 
  just one model available , or maximum two . 
  if it 's shit - sorry , it 's just that one . 
  and even for that one , if you have the money , you 'll have to wait . 
  wait a lot . 
  for a fridge - wait . 
  for a car - wait . 
  well , if you 're more equal you will get it way sooner , but if you 're an average person - sorry . 
  man , when the `` more equal '' people were allowed to travel abroad they were coming back with all kinds of everyday items , just because they were not available here , or because the shops in the western countries just had things in them . 
  it 's ... crazy . 
  something like north korea today . 
  something like that . 
  imagine north korean allowed to go to china , let 's say . 
  as far as i know , it 's something that was everywhere in the socialist block . 
  people were saying , that you have to be an idiot if you do n't steal . 
  the conscript army officers were `` stealing '' the work of the conscripts . 
  if one officer is building his village house , guess who 's working like a slave for absolutely free ? 
  yep , i 'm not kidding . 
  so that 's a way to build a summer house for free . 
  if you 're an important officer - you get some materials from couple of people with promise to get their children in good places when they 're conscripted , and then you have the free work of your soldiers . 
  there are even movies , comedies , that exploit these topics . 
  i ca n't imagine how they passed through the censorship . 
  :d sorry , but i 'm kinda ... overexcited on these topics recently . 
  you see , there 's a propaganda that 's trying to spread some nostalgia for the socialism , which is just ridiculous . 
  if someone has such nostalgia - he 's welcome to go and live in north korea or belarus . 
  all the censorship and dictatorship regime they want - for free . 
  and not only that , but it 's a long topic . 
  ( btw there were beer commercials of one brand that exploited the socialist nostalgia , so there was a parody commercial - `` beer from the time when they put your father to the concentration camp '' . ), 
  i think it 's okay . 
  we 're trying to civilise , slowly but steady . 
  the half century of communism fucked the country pretty bad . 
  this regime of paradoxes left its traces everywhere . 
  if you look at a map with the average salaries in europe , you can clearly see where the communism was . 
  we `` inherited '' the shitty mentality , the enormous corruption , the desire to steal everything you can from the state , if you have the chance to do it , and the fucked up systems from the previous communist dictatorship . 
  we also `` inherited '' many of the people who have the power - one way or another . 
  it 's kind of ironic , but all the people with some kind of power - even ... in the religion , the education , the politics and so on ... were ex members ( agents ) of the communist secret police . 
  we 're still at the last place in eu by standard , behind romania , and i explain this to myself with the enormous corruption everywhere . 
  while there , in romania , they try to do something to fight the corruption , here it is everywhere - to the top levels in every system . 
  but yeah , the shitty mentality was inherited from the socialism . 
  you have no idea what it is like . 
  when there is an euro project , you already know that a lot of people will steal whatever they can . 
  still , we 're trying to civilise . 
  slowly but steady . 
  and we are managing to do it . 
  since you ask - we 've seen only good things from the eu . 
  a lot of eu projects for factories , infrastructure , education and so on . 
  unfortunately a lot of them are `` ruined '' , but on a local level , which is only our fault . 
  all the people benefit - free travel , the students - all the possibilities to study abroad , travel and work . 
  basically - freedom . 
  27 years ago we were like prisoners in our country , and now - we 're free to go wherever we want . 
  probably even the european business benefited by outsourcing some of the jobs to bulgaria , so this is a win-win situation for both sides . 
  i ca n't think of anything negative as a consequence of joining the eu . 
  i do n't actually get `` if scandinavia is socialist '' ...  in reality scandinavia is way more `` socialist '' ( which is actually great ) than the so called `` socialist '' states in the recent past ( mine included ) . 
  while ours could be considered dictatorships with censorship , extermination of the political opposition and the dissidents and basically keeping the population in the country like in a prison , ( nothing of which is ... `` social '' ) the scandinavia is way more socialist . 
  so in a way , yeah , it is , and it 's cool . 
  thank you !, 
  oh , we 're a mixture of genes as everyone else . 
  after all we 're ( officially ) here for more than a thousand years . 
  the thing is , during the socialism there were ridiculous claims that we 're purely slavic , which is just stupid . 
  the political involvement and influence was so strong , that it gave us paradoxes like - the proto-bulgarians were just 2-3 thousand people . 
  ( who somehow managed to get victories over byzanthium empire and managed to create the state of bulgaria . 
  also to build cities , castles and so on ... about your question - i guess it 's a subconscious counter-reaction against the theories that were shoved into the people couple of decades ago . 
  yes , i know . 
  i 'm talking about the idea politically promoted during the socialist times that we 're only and purely slavic , on theory originating somewhere around the baltic states . 
  the thing is , that it was promoted through history because of the idea of pan-slavism ( which is total bullshit , because all the slavic nation all through history fought with each other ) . 
  then it was promoted because of the `` big slavic bratushki from russia hurr durr '' . 
  the thing is , even if we have mixture of slavic genes it would be a small minority . 
  as i said - there are couple of theories about the bulgarian origins . 
  some are , as i said , that we 're relatives with the persians . 
  some are - that we 're a mixture of genes . 
  yes , we do look a lot like the serbians , and we 're part of the south slavic language group together with the macedonians , serbians , croatians . 
  but the origins are still unknown and a matter of dispute . 
  also , i doubt it you have the words : babrek , veriga , toyaga , gerdan , sharan , hambar , zurla , pervaz ... and so on . 
  we 're also very specific and differentiating from the slavs in architecture , history , clothing , way of life . 
  i would say we 're closer to the hungarians , than to the slavic people . 
  for example , when i hear slavic ( in history ) , i imagine : [ this ] ( http://img0.liveinternet.ru/images/attach/c/9/107/522/107522106_slavyanin.jpg ) and [ this ] ( https://www.stihi.ru/pics/2012/08/21/7262.jpg ) [ but we we 're more like this ] ( http://neumirai.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/news/han-krumdfgfdgd.png ) also the architecture is way different . 
  there are couple of theories , though . 
  the language is indeed slavic , but the genetics and the origin of the bulgarians is still a `` mystery '' . 
  some theories say that we 're only slavs , which is stupid , because we look nothing like ... the russian , the ukrainian , the belorussian and so on . 
  [ this for example is a pure bulgarian ] ( http://eva.bg/media_cache/article_popup_gallery/media/zvezdi/novini/hijklmno/nicole_stankulova_1.jpg ) [ this too ] ( http://www.tba.art.bg/img/photos/big1429867488imgp0093_a.jpg ) [ this too - website for photography ] ( http://photo-forum.net/index.php?app_action=gallery_image&amp;image_id=1198998 ) some theories say we 're a mixture of protobulgarians , slavs and thracians . 
  some theories - that we 're `` relatives '' to the persians ( in bulgarian we have persian words that are unknown for the slavs . 
  so yeah , it 's a mystery  edit . 
  the very small minority of bulgarians is naturally blond and not with ... hazelnut color hair . 
  that 's a really hard question . 
  europe is kind of specific ... for example , if you 're more familiar with the people , you probably could recognise a slavic person , a spanish person , probably a greek person , but sometimes you can see lighter and darker people in every country . 
  so in a way , as we 're all europeans , it 's hard to distinguish specifically where 's this person from . 
  i mean , usually ( ! ), 
  you can distinguish a bulgarian and a german , for example , but still , you can never be sure . 
  so we ca n't be mistaken for the wrong nationality because there 's no way to guess . 
  edit . 
  i did a bad job explaining . 
  all i wanted to say is - you can have some idea if one person is for example swedish and not albanian , but one guy could be ... swedish , german , dutch , norwegian , finnish and so on . 
  so you just get to know where is this person from . 
  also the same guy could be just very light bulgarian or romanian . 
  and as you ca n't be sure , you have to ask and you ca n't mistake someone . 
  never happened to me , but i 've heard it happened to other bulgarians . 
  `` what ? 
  you 're bulgarian ? 
  but you 're white ! '',
