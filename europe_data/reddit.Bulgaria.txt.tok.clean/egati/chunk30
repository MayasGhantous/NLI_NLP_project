  but as a whole - very few people own guns and not that many would kill an animal . 
  totally neutral . 
  i do n't know absolutely everything about him , but for me it 's a cool dude with great military mind and loved by the people , because they got him back from his first exile . 
  epic historical figure . 
  we have a lot of materialistic gold diggers too , but i guess when you talk with her for a while you understand what she 's interested into . 
  also by the way she looks . 
  you have snooki , we have a lot like her . 
  we make fun of them but they are often used as sugar babies , drive expensive cars and are as dumb as a brick . 
  but if she looks like a normal girl there 's a chance she 's just a normal girl and not a gold digger . 
  for example , here the people drive older cars and the `` prostitutes '' so to speak , are interested in guys who drive new and expensive cars , often bought by their parents , who own semi-legal businesses . 
  yeah , it 's a long story :d, 
  i 've heard that in some places it 's normal for a prostitute to come to you at the bar or somewhere , but i 've personally never had this experience here . 
  as far as i know if someone is looking for a prostitute there are ads in the newspapers or on websites with phones . 
  also - they are on the sides of the roads . 
   it actually is a romanian site but it opened for bulgaria couple of years ago . 
  i 'm not sure it 's in other countries , but here it made a great success the first black fridays , though there are some controversies with the website - they had a fine for almost 2.5 million euros . 
  now they registered the phrase `` black friday '' in bulgarian and the people are like `` the state is retarded to let them register this phrase '' ... stuff like that . 
  yes . 
  and yes . 
  yep . 
  but mostly online shops . 
  it 's even getting ridiculous , because one of the shops ( emag ) registered the phrase `` black friday '' ( in bulgarian ) . 
  emag , lol :d, 
  weeell ... if we talk geographically , slovaks are proud that they are in the middle of europe . 
  there are couple other middles of europe , depending how you measure it . 
  every language is pleasant in it 's own way . 
  when a french woman speaks , this sounds very romantic . 
  scandinavian languages are cool because they are so strange and interesting . 
  english is awesome too . 
  i love to listen russian in songs . 
  german is badass , though unfortunately i do n't speak it . 
  i guess i love all the languages . 
  the family flat is 45 years old , but our house is around 110 years old . 
   ironically it 's the same with the apple products . 
  first - our economy is shit in comparison . 
  and second - i think they sell apple products even more expensive . 
  ironically you can still see people with iphones , that are like ... two-three month salaries . 
  let me check so i can talk with numbers  microsoft windows 7 professional , 32/64bit , english ggk sp1 ( from the biggest e-shop ) is for 464 bg leva = around 250 usd . 
  office home and student 2016 win english , medialess - 349 bg leva = around 190 usd . 
  so , both for 440 usd . 
  the minimum brutto month salary at the moment is close to 230usd ( 420 bulgarian leva ( bgn ) ) many people outside of sofia work for around 250 usd net salary a month . 
   in sofia , if you 're lucky , you can get around 1000 usd a month - call centre or something like that . 
  let me check the iphones ... apple iphone 7 plus , 256gb , black ( the most expensive ) is for 2.239 bg leva - or around 1 217 usd . 
   sorry for the completely useless for you information , but it 's a paradox for our shitty economy to get even more expensive stuff . 
  most of the people use windows and office , but we do n't buy it . 
  we have a reason for that , though . 
  as i said - it 's more than a month salary . 
  imagine ... ( do n't know how you make a month , but let 's say ... ) , if windows + office costed 2 thousand dollars . 
  just the software . 
  so you had two options - go to some store , pay 2 thousand dollars for just a software , get back , install it and so on . 
  or the other option is to get it for free , way easier and faster , saving yourself 2000usd . 
  we 're poor fuckers , ( which is not an excuse , because we would n't download a car hehe ) , but we do feel these prices impossible/illogical to pay . 
  i have to admit , for our excuse , that more and more people buy their games , but there are great sales and people just love their favourite games . 
  movies - have n't bought them . 
  he-he-he . 
  well , i do pay satellite tv ( hbo ) , so in a way - could count it like buying movies made in the usa . 
  i really forgot about mcdonalds and coca-cola . 
  also have n't bought windows . 
  we , to be honest , usually do n't buy windows and office , 'cause they 're more than a month salary ( windows + office ) . 
  oh , damn , i forgot about coca cola and mcdonalds . 
  honestly , i hope you manage to keep your business and not let it be outsourced to some cheaper destination . 
  we already have hp and ibm outsourced here . 
  they find way , way cheaper workers , and the workers find relatively good salaries . 
  for example , a good salary for someone working with couple of languages here would be 1000usd a month ... 
  i 'm not sure if i 've ever even bought something made in the usa ... 
  funny , in bulgarian it 's almost the same like `` autostop '' . 
  i wondered why the finnish dude did n't understand . 
  :d then i remembered `` the hitchhiker 's guide to the galaxy '', 
  bulgaria ca n't into schengen :(, 
  this sounds to me like `` is it possible do get from new york to nicaragua using just public buses '' . 
  there are relatively cheap international busses , but there 's no such thing as city line that will travel to the next country . 
  for me it 's completely distant language but it 's pleasant and melodic . 
  something like bololal alakrloo oalealaboraebo . 
  your economy is better than ours . 
  but here 's an idea . 
  ask your parents/relatives to give you 400 usd a month . 
  come live in bulgaria , without even working . 
  that would be pretty nice net salary for outside of the capital , you would even be able to rent a place and live kinda okay . 
  some of them work ( semi-legally ? 
  or with special permission from parents ? 
  not sure ... ) during the summer , as a waitresses , for example . 
  it 's funny , but we often have other `` problem '' . many of the students in the universities work , even full time jobs . 
  that 's why they are not able to finish their studies and in their third or even final year - they just quit the university . 
  which is just stupid , because they spend a lot of money for expenses - semesters , textbooks and so on , they `` waste '' their time and in the end - they just quit . 
  i think it 's better to finish your degree without working ( if you ca n't find part time job that really suits you and you can study hard ) or if you do n't have the financial capabilities , or stipend , just do n't start the university and build your career , which some of the students who graduated think is the smarter choice . 
  balkan ... is a feeling :d it 's a diagnose :d, 
  we basically have the serious medias - tvs , news websites and newspapers . 
  if they are biased in some way , i would say it 's very subtle , it ca n't be felt . 
  i think they 're all pretty centrist . 
  we have couple of medias belonging to one `` oligarch '' , fat fcker , who made a lot of bulgarians to go out and protest , because the politicians wanted to put him a chief of the national security service in bulgaria , when he 's a criminal and oligarch . 
  [ this guy ] ( https://clubz.bg/sites/default/files/userfiles/images/%d0%9f%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82/%d0%94%d0%b5%d0%bb%d1%8f%d0%bd%20%d0%9f%d0%b5%d0%b5%d0%b2%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8_1427956198324.jpg ) [ again ] ( http://bez-cenzura.com/media/k2/items/cache/5937f741237693bc434dc4d961ec0148_xl.jpg ) then we have a lot of `` news '' websites that are new , multiplying all the time , sometimes just disappearing and basically spreading the same shit . 
  they are websites for pro-russian propaganda and conspiracies , very shady and copy-pasting the news among themselves . 
  some basement with couple of pcs and one or two guys who write bullshit all the time . 
  tens , if not - a hundred , websites with all the ridiculous names you can think of . 
  they spread shit on the internet , trolls spread their shit on facebook and the circle continues . 
  and in the end , because it 's a whole different category , we have the television and the newspaper of the political party sponsored by russia . 
  imagine , one journalist , who in the 90s wrote against russia and the soviet union . 
  this guy makes a political party with nationalistic symbolism , similar posture and talking to the national-socialist party and so on . 
  he gathers supporters . 
  than in probably a day this same guy gets a lot of money and becomes the biggest supporter of the communism , of russia , of the soviet union and shit .
