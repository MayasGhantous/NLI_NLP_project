  now they 're waving russian flags all the time . 
  with these money this fucker makes a newspaper and a television , that 's spreading anti-eu , anti-nato and pro-putin propaganda 24/7 , reaching ridiculous levels . 
  - \u044f\u0441\u043b\u0430 ( yasla ) - it 's for babies from one to three years old , i think . 
  some of the parents prefer to have the babies at home , though . 
  a bit safer , especially when it 's flu season . 
  - kindergarten - from 3 to 6 years old . 
  it 's separate `` institution '' , not like for example the usa where it seems it 's in the schools . 
  - primary school - from 6/7 years old ( first grade ) till 8th grade . 
  ( you get `` primary education diploma '' . 
  some ... uneducated ... people get just that . 
  but almost all continue . ), 
  - high school - from 8th or 9th grade ( depends of the school ) till 12th grade . 
  ( you get high school diploma , obviously  ) - bc degree - 4 years . 
  - mgr degree - 1 year ( or two , if you study something a bit different of your field ), 
  completely open borders ? 
  this ca n't happen , because on theory it would mean all the countries in the world have to say - tomorrow we remove all the borders . 
  which ca n't happen . 
  not when there are neighbouring countries like russia and ukraine , north and south korea , russia and georgia , serbia and kosovo , and so on , and so on . 
  so the question is pointless . 
  if you ask me about if we support schengen , that would be really , really useful . 
  no more waiting at the borders for hours . 
  damn faster travel . 
  the `` free speech oppression '' comes with the polonium in the tea , mate . 
  or shutting the mouths of the mothers who lost their sons who were sent to fight in ukraine . 
  stuff like that . 
  220grams of good chips - 1 euro and 10 cents, 
  what do you mean by `` russia '' ? 
  `` russia '' could include politics , history , people , cuisine , culture , literature , music ... 
  but since you ask ... russia - retarded politics . 
  going slowly back to stalinism , but it would be in the future called putinism . 
  gave to the world 50 years of regime that hold back a lot of countries for a lot of time , we 're still unable to reach the western countries in salaries/standard . 
  but russia is also great literature , great music , great art . 
  poor russian guys ( the ordinary people ) suffered just as us . 
  and now they 're living in a state without free speech , so i guess the suffering continues one way or another . 
  edit . 
  you say that hillary wants ww3 ... 
  i do n't give a fuck about her , but as you 're obviously a trump funny guy , do n't you think putin wants ww3 too ? 
  let 's see ... - most of the refugees/migrants do n't do anything bad , they just pass illegally through bulgaria . 
  - the fear that exist is mostly because of the arabs who committed terrorist acts , and who actually still do it . 
  i think all of them are not from these migrants , but they are second generation immigrants . 
  - i can talk about bulgaria - the migrants do n't want to stay here , because they want to go to germany or england , so we ca n't manage to keep them here , even when the government wanted to . 
  as far as i know there are n't major crimes made by them , but it 's also a fact , that in sofia ( i do n't live there ) there are areas where a lot of migrants stay , and where women or men alone are afraid to go , because they shout at them , basically do n't behave well . 
  i mean , if you 're a woman and 20 people are shouting and you and offending you , it 's understandable . 
  - me , personally , they did n't affect in any way , because i do n't have contacts with the migrants . 
  they have affected negatively people in sofia - who are afraid to go alone / late at night , at these places . 
  the prices of the apartments in these areas dropped a lot . 
  some shops closed because they lost their clients . 
  there were also cases of stabbings i think , robberies , shop lifting , but it 's not something that huuuuge . 
  it 's cool . 
  to be honest , if it was as easy as in the usa ( legally ) , i would possess a fine collection of fire arms . 
  but there are a bunch of reasons to be forbidden . 
  sometimes we think ( in bulgaria ) it 's because we hate our politicians and they know it , so they are pretty afraid . 
  imagine a ( communist ) dictatorship when people have guns - just ca n't happen .

  i dipped my wang once . 
  it was nice . 
  talking about beautiful girls :d you are probably sick already of this song , but still :d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr1dsgjhrqe ( btw , i personally do n't agree that bulgarians are slavic , which is obvious when you see the majority of the people here , who have way more often darker eyes/hair , but it 's a looong endless topic  for example is way harder to find natural blond girl , than - brown haired , or as you very nice said - hazelnut ), 
  you also have redheads , who are almost impossible to meet here ... , 
  i do n't know any famous beautiful gypsy woman from bulgaria , to be honest . 
   but the bulgarian girls themselves are very different , some are whiter , some are darker . 
  thinking about one of the `` darkest '' famous and beautiful bulgarians ... for example ... [ radina kardzhilova ] ( http://img.bg.sof.cmestatic.com/media/images/original/sep2010/89242.jpg ) [ one more ] ( http://www.razkritia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/radina_kardjilova.jpg ), 
  well , `` duda '' in bulgarian is sometimes used as a slang for the female ... organ . 
  most often used by the kids when they ca n't say the bad word . 
  in the past it was somehow more . 
  probably more than one meter , but in recent years seems to be less . 
  though i remember couple of years ago temperatures of -35 . 
  i may say we 're a cold country ( though we 're in the south ) , because we sometimes get bellow -30 c , but never seen these things . 
  pretty clever , though !, 
  well , i know that our `` rightwing '' populists are with * sponsored by russia * tags . 
  i do n't know about the british ones , where did they come from , ( probably something like `` bad bulgarians , bad romanians , bad poles ! '' ), 
  but i guess spain just does n't have the mentality to produce such populist retards . 
  your point is ? 
  do n't know if you live in bulgaria or if you have any idea of bulgarian politics , but most of the politicians and people with power - journalists , religion members , university members and so on , are ex-communist agents of the communist secret police . 
  i 'm saying , that anti-eu are only the people who were communists and who are already too old or stupid to understand how the communism crumbled as a system . 
  but at the same time - not so stupid to go live in north korea . 
  see , the communism was that good and such a paradise , that people were shot dead at the borders trying to escape that paradise . 
  no , it 's not a valid observation . 
  anti-eu could be 60-70 + , who were communists during the socialism and who are not smart enough to see how the system completely crumbled . 
  the young and educated people in eastern europe try to use all the benefits of the european union - free travel , possibilities to work , educate , all the european programs . 
  young people in eastern europe use european programs for employment or travel via erasmus programs . 
  i 've ** never ** met young person who is anti-eu and who says `` no , i ** do n't ** want any of the european help , projects , free travel , chance to work and move somewhere abroad or to work for european companies in bulgaria . '', 
  to be honest , for me beautiful women are [ ioana bukovska ] ( http://skandalno.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bukovska.jpg ) or [ elena petrova ] ( http://slava.bg/images/profils/19/elena_petrova_s.jpg ), 
  it 's hard for me to decide for `` the most beautiful '' woman from bulgaria . 
  it depends what people prefer , i guess . 
  black hair and blue eyes - [ nsfw model and actress and shit dilyana popova ] ( http://hotnews.bg/uploads/tinymce/elena/dilyana-popova_kliuki_bg_.png ) ( she also has some nudes * cough-cough * ) if you like `` darker '' type of girl - brown eyes [ nikol stankulova - weather reporter ] ( http://m4.netinfo.bg/media/images/11142/11142012/655-402-nikol-stankulova-po-vreme-na-rabota.jpg ), 
  hah , i guess europe already knows them pretty well . 
  the french gave them bunch of brand new caravans to live into , like ... very cosy caravans . 
  after a year they were totally fcked up . 
  our pensioners . 
  they try to survive with their pensions , who are almost enough for just the electricity and the water bills . 
  the rest is photosynthesis . 
  / s just kidding . 
  no , we do n't have survivalists . 
  after all - we joke , that even if the apocalypse happen , we 're 50 years behind the rest of the world , so we 're okay . 
  we have them both - bags and cartons . 
  i think people buy more often the cartons , because they 're more convinient when using . 
  i think in the past the bags were more often .
