  it 's funny how we 're closer than 200km and we do n't have stronger relations . 
  it 's kind of okay . 
  we 're somehow still alive  the thing that actually bothers me , is that the system is exploited by these , who do n't even pay their healthcare insurance . 
  they call an ambulance or go to the emergency and do n't pay shit ( even if they are not insured ) . 
  the insurance itself is relatively low - the mandatory minimum is something around 9 euros a month ( for unemployed people , the employed get it paid from their salary as taxes ) , but a lot of ... well ... people ... do n't even pay that . 
  that way it 's covered by the `` stupid '' people like me , who even as unemployed pay it every month . 
  to be honest , in bulgaria some cities have gypsy ghettos . 
  very often if an ambulance is called from there , the doctors get beaten by mob of gypsies , aand ... they are not very happy to go there . 
  the police does n't bother to go there , because they are afraid , or they are afraid to do anything , even if they go there . 
  it 's a mixture of shitty laws and the shitty police system in bulgaria . 
  for example - loud gypsy weddings at 2 at night - the police does n't go there to ask them to stop . 
  if something happens - gypsies having a fight - the gendarmerie ( `` special forces '' so to speak ) goes in these ghettos . 
  it 's not as `` scary '' as it sounds , but just the police are pussies to go there ... and a bulgarian would n't go there , because 1 . it 's a ghetto , 2 . it 's full of gypsies and no bulgarians go there . 
  i 'm not familiar with the present situation in ... bronx ? 
  queens ? 
  but it 's probably something similar , or way worse , actually . 
  for example , real photos from these places : http://www.cross.bg/photo_new_gallery/2014/04/25/142e3d1d4be7b8c177ff30f138ec3bde.jpg http://old.omda.bg/studentski_forum/image28.gif http://img.bg.sof.cmestatic.com/media/images/640x360/oct2011/277886.jpg http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/12/23/article-2252675-16a2d74f000005dc-668_634x421.jpg it 's not like it 's `` dangerous '' for the armed police , but the police are lazy pussies , and they do n't go there . 
  red , green and white club , yeyy, 
  of course , we have ( so to speak ) western , european values , 'cause we 're part of the old world . 
  we 're not asians , we 're not arabs , we 're not africans , we 're europeans . 
  the question itself is really subjective . 
   eastern europe is ... sometimes slavic , sometimes balkan , the border to the orient , sometimes it 's ex-socialist , eastern europe is european , it all depends of the point of view . 
  i 've watched scandinavian comedy once . 
  probably because of the cultural difference , but i was like `` wtf ?!? '', 
  the whole time . 
  but !, 
  `` l\u00e5t den r\u00e4tte komma in '' is one of the best movies i 've watched . 
  sometimes we make great movies , really , really touching and powerful . 
  but they are mostly about the dark and hard parts of our history , so most of them are depressing . 
  we also used to make great comedies , but recently we 're somehow not capable to do it . 
  our shows are awful . 
  showmen trying to be funny and they really suck at it . 
  i prefer to watch british or american shows . 
  music ... the music in the present times is awful too , cliche pop bullshit , or even worse - the typical for the balkans chalga . 
  the amazing and magical music we have is the folklore . 
  people all over the world fall in love with it . 
  british entertainment is fcking awesome and thank you god for the torrents !, 
  else i would never be able to see `` blackadder '' , for example ... 
  shitty economy - if you take the map of the minimum salary per country , you can see where the communism had been . 
  also - east germany and west germany , north korea and south korea and so on ... shitty mentality of the older generation . 
  it 's a long story to explain , but during the communism all the people with connections ( communists ) did n't work shit all day long , staying in an office , doing nothing . 
  and few of the people worked their asses off . 
  also - everybody was stealing , corruption and so on , so that 's why you can see this shit all over the ex-communist countries . 
  shitty architecture ... just ... shitty . 
  shitty infrastructure . 
  shitty systems - educational , medical and so on . 
  the same - people with connections - get everywhere . 
  there was a time when only communists could get in the university . 
  no matter if they are illiterate or stupider than a donkey . 
  people who were children of non-communists or have relatives abroad - even if they were geniuses - were not allowed to the university . 
  shitty politicians ( because they all are the same faces of the communism , just older ) . 
  ex-members of the communist party , or ex-members of the communist secret police . 
  even some of our priests are agents of the communist police . 
  i 'm not joking . 
  also - shitty media and journalists - because of the same reason . 
  there is some in the shops , and i think i 've tried once , but almost no one eats it . 
  yes . 
  we use them to store our glorious kompots and other stuff . 
  example of glorious kompots and other stuff : http://dariknews.bg/uploads/news_images/200811/photo_verybig_303131.jpg, 
  just 7-8 more months to go : /, 
  i think the cheapest vodka ( `` flirt '' and similar bullshit ) would be around 4 euros for a bottle . 
  you can get something way better for around 10 euros . 
  oh , yes . 
  i 'm not joking , that some of our dialects are way harder to understand than the macedonian , 
  so easy , we do n't use interpreters when we do interviews . 
  probably as easy as for an american to understand an australian . 
  macedonia . 
  just kidding , just kidding !, 
  actually in the rhodope mountains there are dialects that are one thousand times harder to understand than the macedonian . 
  also the northwest part of the country has some funny accents/dialects , and we often joke with these poor guys . 
  varna - 'cause for the sea veliko tarnovo - because of the history and the architecture plovdiv - because i know a lot of cool people from there, 
  '' \u0411\u0430\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u043d\u044c\u043e '' ( bai ganio ) by aleko konstantinov - we need it to remember who we should not be . 
  '' \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0438\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e '' ( pod igoto ) by ivan vazov - we need it to remember who we should be . 
  and probably something from elin pelin or iordan iovkov , because they use the full power of the magical bulgarian language . 
  :d aaah , and so has our past :d, 
  well , it 's the past . 
  for more information : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkification what become of these who chose to become muslim : http://www.dw.com/image/16087888_303.jpg there are also relatively recent photos of the annihilation of cities/villages and the mass murders during last attempts for liberation in the 19th century , but better not to show them . 
  `` turkify '' - the word itself comes from the years of ottoman slavery . 
  it means - the ottoman army comes and kills everyone who does n't want to turn muslim , sometimes destroying whole villages , or sometimes - turning whole villages muslim . 
  it means - `` to break something '' or `` to lose something '' . 
  example `` did you `` turkify '' your new bike ? '', 
  - `` did you break your new bike ? '', 
  to be honest , i do n't think you would meet racism coming here , it 's more likely to meet curiosity `` woow , where are you from , do you like it here , tell me more about yourself '' stuff like that . 
  i 've only met indians just once , medical students studying here , and as far as i know they had no problems during their stay . 
  99.9 percent of bulgarians are very cool with the foreigners . 
   but seriously , the only racism that could be met here is ... by accident . 
  we have a lot of problems with our gypsies and sometimes some retarded skinheads can make troubles to some gypsies , but again , because the skinheads are also retarded - it 's when they are drunk and like 10 people ... then they try to find someone to fight with , no matter who ... we 're considered conservative about homosexuality , and gays would find people staring at them , but again - absolutely no physical and most probably no verbal harm would be done to them ( unless some retarded `` skinheads '' ) . 
  aaah , also - there are stories about idiots beating immigrants at the border ... the same idiots are criminals - drug dealers and similar stuff , who decided to change their `` profession '' and now they sit at the border , robbing immigrants . 
  it 's not because of some `` nationalistic '' feeling that suddenly had awaken in them :d just stealing iphones and money . 
  edit - but you 're absolutely right , eastern europe would sound scarier , 
  copy-paste from wikipedia * makes ashamed face * the last movie from/about pakistan was a documentary about a father who tried to kill his daughter , because she wanted to live with some guy . 
  this was about a real case and the same idiot was already in prison ( but they said most probably he would be released because `` he 's a man , he feeds the family '' ) . 
  so , he was in prison and said something like : yeah , she lives in my home , i feed her . 
  she ca n't decide that she wants to live with him and that 's why we wanted to kill her , and i 'm happy i wanted to kill her . 
  it says so in the quran . 
  here we 're in the more `` conservative '' part of europe and still for me this is a huge cultural difference , that even makes me angry . 
  it was something you ca n't hear people talking about their animals . 
  and this was his daughter . 
  edit . 
  obviously that 's probably not a reason some foreigner should be afraid to go there , buuuuut ... there 's no point,
