  it 's just beautiful  if i was an american i would like to see every bit and different state . 
  of course there are things that could piss me off in the us , because there is some cultural difference between europe and usa , but it 's another question ... 
  hahahahaha the oligarchy has `` all the say '' in every regard . 
  assuming putin is not from the oligarchy ( hahaha ) , if he wants to start something that even the slightest would cause problem to them ... even he will disappear . 
  or easier - the next elections would chose a politician who is a better pet . 
  even now with these restrictions for travel to some of the oligarchs . 
  imagine a new iron curtain . 
  hahahahaha , all the oligarchs with ladas and moskviches :d, 
  where are the tanks here ? 
  want to take some photos !, 
  why no tanks here ?!, 
  naaaaah , imagine all the russian oligarchs with their millions ( billions ) and expensive limousines and shit and palaces and stuff would like to lose all of this ? 
  because of what ? 
  two cities and couple of villages in ukraine ? 
  yeah , absolutely sure , can confirm !, 
  the ~ ~ martians ~ ~ ~ ~ reptilians ~ ~ xenu told me that yesterday !, 
  thank you for the advice !, 
  oh , yeah , it 's a good beer , no doubt about it !, 
  especially when comparing it to our brands . 
  but still i 've found a difference ( for example ) in stella artois made in belgium and one made in bulgaria ...  you 're lucky to be in the beer part of europe , and the beers themselves are like `` cuisine '' , while we 're more into wines and harder alcochol , but that 's another long topic ... , 
  talking about belgian beer - leffe < 3 i love heineken too , buut not as much ... ( actually do n't know if heineken here is imported , but probably is made here : / ) , 
  damn czech republic !, 
  motherfucking popara for the win !, 
  real ships have curves !, 
  check on that too :p https://www.google.bg/search?q=%d0%b1%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%86%d0%b0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=g1gwvc2miinapk_igeap&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1116&amp;bih=528, 
  guys , you know what is boza , right ? 
  i do n't see the boza here !, 
  :d :d :d btw the westerners are somehow afraid to drink boza :d, 
  i see what you did there :d, 
  logic ? 
  what logic ? 
  you 're absolutely right about the salaries in the it sector . 
   i 'm not familiar with it , but as you mentioned it ( if you work a job related ) do you know the salaries in the uk or germany ( or france , spain ... ? ), 
  for programmers ? 
  i thought more specifically about the outsourcing sectors that use people with more than one foreign language . 
  many young bulgarians speak at least english , and it 's not rare to see people speaking even two foreign languages ( so - three with mothers tongue ) . 
  now it starts to get funny . 
  many companies give salaries for shitty call center jobs around 600 net salary in the province , or probably 1000 net in sofia . 
  which is ~ 500 net euro , for a person who speaks english + other language . 
  imagine if they try to find someone in ... germany ... who speaks english and hungarian on working level . 
  and to pay him a salary like that per month . 
  :d or in the uk someone with three languages ... for ( do n't know ) 400 pounds net salary ( ? ), 
  a month . 
  i mean - you 're right about the low taxes and probably anarchistic bureaucracy and rules , which could be a plus for some company . 
  also - shitty working hours and just a behavior that someone from western europe would n't tolerate the slightest . 
  yep . 
  we 're smart and we 're cheap . 
  we 're in the eu . 
  we 're ( relatively ) close geographically . 
  btw i want to marry boggie < 3, 
  meh , we have the same retarded political party that does idiotic protests . 
  it 's like some kind of freak comedy , because the party is `` nationalistic '' even `` far-right '' , but the protests had soviet flags and these idiots scream `` russia '' `` russia '' every time . 
  the `` fascist '' leader turned into communist in a moment , even invited kobzon to sing at his party concert . 
  but he 's like a circus clown ... he even hid under a plastic table , because the people `` love '' him so much . 
  nothing * . 
  :d we just like to laugh at ourselves . 
  ( * or almost everything , depending on the view point ... ), 
  sheeeit . 
  i 'm in bulgaria !, 
  oh , you just wait - soon putin will land on the sun and will put the russian flag next to the north korean . 
  i think that such propaganda should be against the law , as it could lead ( well ... presuming someone is stupid enough to believe it ) to diplomatic scandals on really high level . 
  yep , that 's us . 
  i doubt it that such a high percent here can be able to hold a normal conversation in russian . 
  the previous generation most certainly forgot the language ... to understand russian - probably such a percent can . 
  even higher . 
  than probably i 'm able too ... :d, 
   do n't know the reason but i think we smuggle some from serbia , because i 've traveled by train and the customs found some hidden . 
  probably there the cigarettes are cheaper , but i do n't know much about it , and i guess it 's in small quantities . 
  but indeed here exists a huge illegal market for cigarettes and you can see in every city gypsies selling illegal cigarette boxes . 
  when you 're just walking they will stop you and ask you if you want to buy cigarettes . 
  i do n't smoke but i 've heard that these cigarettes taste like shit . 
  i think the boxes are without banderole , so i suppose they 're produced in illegal factories in bulgaria . 
  actually there was one huge illegal factory busted recently . 
  there 's also a market with `` illegal '' tobacco , because you can see plenty of gypsies selling tobacco in transparent cheap plastic bags straight on the street . 
  they do n't even try to hide ... 
  guess the police just does n't give a fck , or they get payed . 
  about the smoking - i would say the percentage of smokers here unfortunately is higher than slovakia . 
  you can see younger and younger starting smoking , as young as 13-14 . 
  found some statistics but it 's about the number of cigarettes smoked , not the percentage of people . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_cigarette_consumption_per_capita edit and ps . 
  - aah , forgot to mention something we 're proud of !, 
   we banned smoking in clubs , restaurants , bars and so on ... 
  it 's sooo nice to go to the club and not smell awful after that !, 
  even a huge percentage of the smokers are happy and agree with the ban - saying they prefer to go outside for a smoke but not to smell like shit and to be able to breath a normal air in the club or restaurant . 
  it 's great that the tobacco industry had n't lobbied about removing the ban ... , 
  daaaamn !, 
  that 's pretty clever , though !, 
  imagine the cigarette smuggling between moldova and romania !, 
  edit . 
  or between czech republic and germany ... fuck this , i should go there and make a business !, 
  i have no idea what 's that mass downvoting . 
  i 've seen guys with masks , burnt cars , smashed things and a lot of shit done . 
  if that 's not far left , i do n't know what is ... 
  dude , have you witnessed these things in your country ? 
  have you witnessed the complete incapability of your police considering such stuff ? 
  i understand you completely . 
  i remember how they burnt down a whole castle , though i think it was out of stupidity ... but still . 
  at least in bratislava you do n't face these problems . 
  these things you say - stealing things from the public toilets and such , it looks to me the things our gypsies did before they gone way more worse . 
  now i 'm thinking about stealing everything that can be taken and sold from the old people houses .
