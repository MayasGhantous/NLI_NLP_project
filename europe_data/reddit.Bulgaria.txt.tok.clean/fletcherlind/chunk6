  my experience with a danish company in bulgaria has taught me that nordic business ethic does n't apply when you find yourself in the balkans - the danish started doing the same old shit like they were in bulgaria for decades . 
  institutional environment matters . 
  i 'm amazed no-one has mentioned sofia - most of the places in the central part are cheap and reek of hipster . 
  even though i think kuneva is something far worse than a bitch , i do n't see why someone who graduated something that has its labour market literally flooded with people should complain about his salary . 
  if you want a high salary , develop skills that are truly scarce and needed by business , and you 'll get high income . 
  i 'm not sure this is completely true . 
  yes , some idiots on local tv and 16-year-old ultras call us tatats but i do n't think they form 100 % of public opinion . 
  their political leadership , on the other hand , is what i 'd call bulgarophobic . 
  and no doubt bulgarians consider macedonians brothers , some 2 million people here are descendants of people from macedonia . 
  historically - germany , hungary , croatia . 
  it would be funny if you see the alternative to this - the russian army can not control its own officers fleeing their jobs and fleeing the country . 
  is n't it scary that an army which can not control its own men possesses nuclear weapons ? 
  all bulgarians call thesalloniki solun from centuries , is there anything you 'd like to do about that ? 
  the issue is not the material law - what 's mandatory and what 's not , but its enforcement instead . 
  many bulgarian citizens do n't send their kids to school ( mainly gypsies ) but smaller schools depend on financing per student so they do n't expel those students that never show up . 
   and it is hard to find out who is who when the economic immigrants are dumping all of their legitimate identification and buying illegal syrian ones . 
  we should adopt what the us immigration authorities do - interview every ( or as many as we could ) immigrant so it 's certain that this person is an actual syrian . 
  documents are easy to forge so we should n't solely rely on them . 
  but that 's the ideal world , haha . 
  i guess some species kill for fun too . 
  well , this is very individual in my opinion . 
  i know a syrian girl who fled the war and came to sofia a couple of years ago , she 's already going to university , working two part-time jobs and is getting better and better with her bulgarian by the day . 
  however , i doubt that most of the people from the middle east would integrate so easily and quickly . 
  and yes , the eu should not receive economic immigrants and these should be deported . 
  clean electric vehicles are the future of personal transportation . 
  or so i hope . 
  this is common practice all over europe , or at least it was before modern housing . 
  what a lovely place tallinn is !, 
  so you think they spoke swedish in the kievan rus ' ? 
  the modern bulgarian state was established after a war between the russian and the ottoman empire ; also 45 years of a russian communist regime to which a whole lot of people were ( and still are ) loyal . 
  also russia became a thing because of bulgaria back in the 10th and 11th century . 
  the whole neighborhood 's got this kinda-fucked-up vibe . 
  no doubt people might have a different opinion , and in bulgaria a lot of people are sympathetic to russia , maybe a lot more than any other country in eastern europe except serbia . 
  but my own experience from local news sites and message boards is that a lot of this type of activity is organized , there have ever been reports of parties actually procuring trolls - which is pretty disturbing . 
  no wonder it 's like that in bulgaria , we have no functioning prosecution at a high level and it 's a systematic problem that the romanians seem to have solved . 
  knowing nothing bad will happen to you if you break the rules is the very definition or corruption - it corrupts even the honest . 
  [ always rated him ] ( http://www.transfermarkt.de/alexander-merkel/profil/spieler/86926 ), 
   russia 's attitude was essentially domineering and she always tried to keep a balancing act between serbia and bulgaria and ultimately ended up supporting serbia over bulgaria most of the time . 
  completely agree on that and i think we 're talking about the same thing in different terms . 
   russia never once tried to support bulgaria when it 's quite clear that she very much tried to after the first balkan war . 
   what are you even trying to say ? 
  serbia had vardar macedonia in their possession , initially refused to budge to bulgarian pressure , and after severe russian pressure accepted arbitration . 
  there is a chronological problem with that . 
  russian arbitration for vardar macedonia was set in the treaty between bulgaria and serbia in the ** spring ** of 1912 , some six months before the start of the war , and at that time serbia was certainly not in possession of any part of macedonia . 
  in that treaty vardar macedonia was conditionally split into two zones - i 'll call them conditional and unconditional as that 's how i 've studied them in school . 
  [ map in french ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/ligne_de_partage_d%27apr%c3%a8s_la_carte_annex%c3%a9e_au_trait%c3%a9_d%27alliance.jpg/800px-ligne_de_partage_d%27apr%c3%a8s_la_carte_annex%c3%a9e_au_trait%c3%a9_d%27alliance.jpg ) the unconditional zone would be annexed by bulgaria if an autonomous governance could not be established by the local population . 
  the conditional zone ( the dark part of the map ) would be contested between bulgaria and serbia with the arbitration of the russian emperor . 
   russia very much tried to help bulgaria after the first balkan war . 
  it had pretty much forced serbia into russian arbitration over vardar macedonia , which serbia was refusing to partition as agreed upon with bulgaria pre-war ( because the forced creation of albania worked to the detriment of serbia 's prospective territorial gains ) . 
  long before that russia took serbia 's side in the 1885 war , ordering its officers to abandon the bulgarian army ( which at that point was 6-7 years old ) , and after that organised a coup against the bulgarian ruler , and then another failed one against the bulgarian regency . 
  thanks for that help . 
    serbia had accepted arbitration and would 've likely handed over a significant portion of vardar macedonia to bulgaria thanks to russian intervention ( and russia again tried to press serbia over territorial concessions when the entente were trying to get bulgaria to join wwi on their side ) . 
  how can one hand something over if it 's not in his possession ? 
  i 've read ceta , have you ? 
  what exactly bothers you with the breach of ` fair and equitable treatment ' or ` expropriation ' , and please explain how raising the health and safety standards - a constant process in the eu despite all member states adopting gatt and being members of the wto - would be considered a violation ot 8.10 . or 8.12 . 
   in a dictatorship perhaps , but both the eu states and canada are first world democracies with a stable tradition of rule of law . 
  states can not just tax , enter and fine : their own national court systems would make quick work of those that attempt to do so . 
  this is so wonderfully naive . 
   `` unfairly '' is a subjective term . 
  no it 's not . 
  it means treating a foreign investor in a different manner and under different condition compared to local entities - just based on the fact that it 's a foreign one . 
  simple as that . 
  and no , not anything can be considered damage - only a government intervention that is discriminatory . 
  and also states have a fuckton of instruments to influence companies - including , but not limited to : taxation , all forms of checks and inspections , and fines - none of which are subject to a fair trial ; the state does n't have to prove a case , it just intervenes . 
   not anymore , due to isds . 
  that 's the whole point : restraining the possible actions of states to the advantage of multinational business . 
   dude , just read the damn thing . 
  http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf states are restrained in terms of treating a business unfairly only because of its national origin , that 's all . 
   it shows that your argument of not having specialized courts is of no value in many states . 
  as i said , belgium having purely commercial litigation is of no use to an investor who wants to do business ** in my country ** for various reasons . 
  and for a bunch of reasons , using arbitration is way more convenient and cheap than to establish a whole new type of litigation just because there is such in belgium . 
   fta treaties , however , have power of law and are legally binding . 
  just like contracts between private parties are binding - as you face negative consequences for breaching a contract - even though signing the contract or the treaty is purely voluntary . 
   that makes it worse , because a state is bound to abide by it regardless . 
  the exact same conditions apply to states and investors . 
  also , a state can intervene in a number of ways if facing and undesirable behavior by a business , and isds is there only if public intervention is either discriminatory or without necessary compensation . 
   payments are suspended during the case . 
  so if i 'm a business and the state fails to deliver its payment for years , i 'll just tell all my workers that payments are suspended so that they could , please , suspend their sense of hunger ? 
   or just lay them off , like most people would do . 
  belgium having a commercial court is of no use to an investor in bulgaria . 
   those are on a voluntary case-by-case agreement to settle a specific dispute by those means . 
  that is vastly different from being bound to be judged by isds for all cases in the future . 
  countries that are to use isds have signed voluntary treaties as well , so the principle is the same . 
  the investor on his behalf is by no means bound by ceta to use international arbitration , he can always take the case to a local court , and isds is an option . 
   fast resolution is more convenient for everyone . 
  true , although not in the same way for everyone - you ca n't compare a commercial argument that could end up with thousands of workers on the street and a partition of land between me and my cousins that i hate so much . 
  yes , in bulgaria a case by investor against the state would go under general civil litigation . 
  like in most other countries . 
  and yes , arbitration is pretty old , actually the international court of arbitration was founded in ... 1923 . 
  and it 's common practice , as i mentioned , between businesses ever since . 
  just in my country there are several arbitration institutions . 
  this is i guess the biggest one in bulgaria : http://www.bcci.bg/bcci-arbitration-court-en.html you can appeal before european courts after all possible options for litigation under national law have expired - this means after you 've gone the full procedure in national litigation , and that takes years . 
  which brings me to the topic of swiftness - if it 's about your investment , time does matter and waiting 2-3-5 years means you 're going under . 
  you can see the text itself , actually . 
  http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2014/september/tradoc_152806.pdf sections c and d ( article 8.6 to article 8.14 ) establish the grounds on which an investor can sue a government under ceta . 
  these are basically `` breaches of fair and equitable treatment '' and `` expropriation of assets '' . 
  article 8.6 declares that * `` 1 . 
  for the purpose of this chapter , the parties reaffirm their right to regulate within their territories to achieve legitimate policy objectives , such as the protection of public health , safety , the environment or public morals , social or consumer protection or the promotion and protection of cultural diversity . 
  '' * so as a bottom line - not true at all , at least in my ( semi-professional ) view . 
  we have sarmi and musaka as well !,
