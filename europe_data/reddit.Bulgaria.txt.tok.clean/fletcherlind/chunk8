  the oman state fund is using it to seek compensation for the money they lost in ktb , although it 's quite far-fetched to claim expropriation in this situation , and they will most likely lose . 
  i 'm not guaranteed who will become pm of my country to the slightest when i vote , and back in 2005 there were several options for pm . 
  it 's more or less the same with the ec , the difference is people in the epp or pes teams are not that recognisable compared to national figures . 
  executives are never elected from the population , it 's the representatives that are . 
   look up isds . 
  that is a system of where companies can sue countries for making democratic policy decisions . 
  ttip was negotiated with companies but eu mp 's have very limited access . 
  it expands intellectual property rights to create monopolies . 
  goddamnit , the same myths over and over again . 
  isds does not let you sue for ` democratic decisions ' but for discriminative treatment or unlawful expropriation . 
  a quick example from my country . 
  a foreign company has received an offer to bribe the government ( yes , from a public official ) in order to remain in a public procurement procedure . 
  if the company declines the offer ( and does n't pay up ) it wo n't run for the procurement . 
  it 's pointless to turn to local courts because they are also corrupt . 
  corruption runs both ways . 
  also - intellectual rights like trade marks are , in fact , monopolies . 
  no one else could use your intellectual property for profit , period . 
  i 'm on the opposite standing - that state building is ultimately a game of systems and placing the right stimuli would result in more adequate governing ( and more adequate actions by all actors in society as a whole ) . 
  as milton friedman put it : * it 's nice to elect the right people , but that is n't the way you solve things . 
  the way you solve things is by making it politically profitable for the wrong people to do the right things . 
  our lack of progress with fixing the political system is actually depressing , yes . 
  tzarigrad sounds the best to me . 
  has science gone too far ? 
  i 'm fucking envious of the romanians . 
  keep it up !, 
  well , there are three nato countries on the black sea , so no wonder nato bases should exist in the area . 
  i 'm pretty sure they went the other way and there 's no return through the bosphorus now . 
  holy shit , that 's more than our entire fleet . 
   basically , after the war europe was growing very fast and in the 70s usa were concerned they would be overcome because they had 1-2 % growth at the time . 
  so they came up with neoliberal policies to boost growth to `` healthy '' 3-4 % and that became new dogma in economics . 
   is n't that a bit of a contradiction ? 
  if western europe had growth bigger than the healthy 1-2 % per year , why would there be a policy to boost it ? 
  it 's already higher than average after all . 
  or you mean specifically the united states ? 
  also according to [ the world bank ] ( http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.kd.zg?locations=us ) , the us had some years back in the 60s with bigger growth , like 4.5 % ( 1962 ) , 5.1 % ( 1965 ) and 5.3 % ( 1966 ) . 
  the thing is , wages in other places in bulgaria are stagnant , so it 's a huge discrepancy - gdp per capita in sofia is * times * bigger than gdp per capita in vidin or silistra . 
  hey , make , it 's you , me . 
  have you had any arguments over parking spots recently ? 
  you should become one , we 're in a bit of a brain drain right now . 
  in case people wonder , this guy here runs the e-government strategy in the , oh well , government . 
  been to cluj-napoca , what a cosy place ! ^ ^ pls ^ come, 
  why does it have to be in a single document ? 
  the form of government / monarchy or republic / is n't related to the source of power / democracy , autocracy or dictatorship / . 
  there are constitutional monarchies , like the uk or the netherlands , and absolute monarchies , like saudi arabia or bahrain . 
   `` good riddance , we can go back to manufacturing '' wonder how many of these people have even the barest minimum of skills required for a job in modern manufacturing ... 
  europa universalis , obviously . 
  the glorious british empire , now including england , wales and antigua . 
  my thoughts exaclty . 
  clowns like farage and boris are going to be okay . 
  it 's the average joe who 's going to suffer because of his own naivety . 
  well , many new member states do n't use the euro , mainly because we do n't meet the requirements . 
  yes , without communism we would be living in the 30s forever !, 
  i loved creating new nations when i annexed older countries . 
  plus the uk and greece , and probably most of the countries in europe have crosses in their coat of arms ( bulgaria for example has ~ ~ five ~ ~ six ) . 
  why would they be removed , it 's their national heritage . 
  of course , no system would just change so dramatically all by itself , most of the time it needs a nudge from outside ... and your lawmakers ' agenda is clear and understandable , they do n't want to see their easy life spoiled . 
  if it were possible , i would ask for the us department of justice to step in bulgaria as if it were a us state . 
  no kidding , they would do miles better than our prosecution system . 
  only if you share some of your successful state prosecution with us ... please !, 
  you 're absolutely right . 
  the best way to preserve peace is to arm and protect yourself as best as you can . 
  fuck ` historical ties ' , by the way , the russians have been mostly on our enemies ' side for the past century , why would we have any sentiment towards them ? 
  actually the anti-corruption act is kuneva 's creation , not that this makes it any better ... it really is a disaster . 
  trying to prove that borisov is actually an intelligent politician - you 've picked up the wrong fight , mate . 
  not because i 'm prejudiced - that 's pretty convenient to say - but because he has shown very little to support such a claim . 
  i think it 's more about current relations between turkey and russia , they 're in a bit of a freeze . 
  so in some respect you 're right because bulgaria would n't fully commit to a joint initiative with the turkish side , not right now . 
  most of the problem in my view is due to russia 's massive pulling power here . 
  fully committing to partnership with countries that have conflicts with the russians ( ukraine , turkey ) is always ` punished ' in one way or another here and it 's a shame we 're not the ally we should be . 
  your second paragraph sounds like a smart way to handle international relations - a bit too smart for borisov and his staff , i think . 
  i just stumbled across this analysis from bulgarian political analyst ognyan minchev . 
  http://clubz.bg/40995-tova_e_nov_format_za_turskata_ambiciq_za_hegemoniq_v_cherno_more his point is that this type of partnership initiated by romania is more or less serves only turkish plans and ambitions to control the sea for themselves . 
  nato 's naval presence is limited by the 1936 montreux convention to 3 weeks per vessel , and that 's why us ships do n't stay longer than that in local harbors . 
  so in short , this joint fleet would be more of a turkish than a nato instrument , and that would n't serve bulgarian interests the same way a nato fleet would . 
  give it a go through google translate , if you find it difficult , i 'll try to translate the whole piece . 
  our pm is spineless . 
  very very true . 
  brain drain looks so devastating if you consider the individual case - someone spends their first 20-25 years in his home country that invests in him - in social care , education , professional skills , only for another country to reap the benefits from this productive individual . 
  i think it 's the biggest problem for our region by far , financial and economic losses can be replaced with less effort than the human loss . 
  yes , indeed , by the soviet union . 
  but its troops left in the end of the 80s ( or even earlier ) . 
  so the us invaded the whole of eastern europe ? 
  that 's new . 
  how can a convicted person run for public office at all ? 
  on a serious note - 0 % does n't seem very realistic , even here there 's some companies that do recycling . 
  and no source whatsoever . 
  sofia is doing fine , it 's the rest of the country that 's worrying . 
  the guardian sounds more and more like a telemarketing show by the day . 
  order your ceta ** now ** and get double corporate enslavement ** for free ** !, 
  back to the roots , i guess . 
  if by europe you mean only western europe - sure . 
  otherwise constantinople would dwarf most medieval cities easily . 
  this is one of the most pathetic rants i 've read on the subject , and much has been said already !, 
  only water was allowed along with the rakia back in the day now the kids use all sorts of flavored fizzy shit . 
  where is the world heading to ? 
  ever thought that europe kinda continues further to the east than austria ? 
  also here even moderate parties tend to follow more nationalistic policies just because of the cultural and political landscape . 
  not exactly . 
  nationalism has always been strong in eastern europe , especially in the balkans . 
  so i do n't see a major tendency here .
