  new zealand exists only in lotr , mate . 
   they cant get simple shit done go live in burkina faso and see what `` ca n't get simple shit done '' means . 
  still the best place in the world to live !, 
  fuck yea , biggest cocks on the balkans out , lads . 
  no crimea tho, 
  does fassbender count as irish ? 
  a nice satellite photo of the first ( partly ) and second bulgarian empires . 
  monica bellucci in malena is the stuff of wet dreams . 
  i get your idea and i remember that 's what his son alexander did all over the east - but my point was that pulpudeva/phillipopolis existed before the macedons took it , even if it was a different type of settlement . 
  history is full of governments who ruled with a long-term vision , regarding their realm as their own property , and yet mismanaged their national economy and/or finances terribly - from the habsburgs in spain , through absolutist france , to communist china , the ussr , even communist bulgaria managed to default three times in 45 years under the same clique . 
  furthermore , a democratic setup does not prevent you from following long-term policy trends - and policy trends are what matters most in the long run . 
  by the way , if this video is representative of hoppe , then he is a very weak thinker . 
  everyone with his own opinion . 
  i think the world we see now would be unsustainable and virtually impossible without a degree of social inclusivity and mobility , and without those two , technological progress would be far slower . 
  while the revolution had a big impact throughout europe all by itself , the tendency towards dismantling absolutism and introducing representative democracy was already there by the end of the 18th century , see britain and its colonies , and i do n't think it 's a bad thing overall . 
  forest whitaker looks worried . 
  every revolution carries the element of world ( re ) creation - i ca n't recall the political philosopher who said that people who participate in major revolutions ca n't help but play god . 
  no wonder they introduced new metrics and a new calendar after the revolution . 
  there is an obvious contradiction in your statement - philip could not establish something new after he took it from the thracians . 
  otherwise there was a settlement there before philip and even before the thracians . 
  it 's on the list of [ the oldest continuously inhabited places in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_oldest_continuously_inhabited_cities#europe ) . 
  also yes , this theatre was built by the romans , probably under domitian . 
  no doubt about it - greek nationalism had a big influence on bulgarian nationalism , quite a few bulgarians took part in the filiki eteria , etc. 
  the same motto was used on all bulgarian revolutionary flags like [ this one ] ( http://agroplovdiv.bg/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/zname_aprilskoto_vastanie-310x238.jpg ) from 1876 - which is quite understandable , there is little to separate in our common history . 
  i wonder why , but local hobos also usually prefer trams over buses , the only exception being 280 - the line going to students town , generally trams are ** way ** smellier . 
  anyway , it 's all fun and games until the hobo shits himself . 
  we have pesa swing here and it 's awesome !, 
  we 're all hobos on saturday night . 
  that 's a shame . 
  i was just about to reveal that i 'm the gypsy woman in the front who carries two huge bags and talks to herself all the time . 
  but anyway , i guess even hobos in lozenets are special snowflakes . 
  you 're not very much into humor now , are you ? 
  if this is your definition of `` not knowing much '' , i feel truly ignorant . 
  i rode it as well , towards the centre . 
  so you were the smelly hobo in the back , right ? 
  dst works perfectly fine in my country . 
  otherwise the sun would rise around 4 am in july which is far too early . 
  people who ca n't adjust to one more/less hour of sleep probably wo n't handle the pressure of having kids . 
  holy shit , who ** does n't ** wash his goddamn hands after taking a dump ? 
  how am i going to live among such animals ? 
  it was/is a big deal because the new party targets the electorate of dps - bulgarian turks , so if they managed to steal their vote or at least cut it into two , it would be a power shift from people closer to russia to people closer to turkey . 
  they partially did that , but they cut off something like 15-20 % from the turkish vote ( i 'm watching it live on tv ) . 
  still , no idea if this takes the votes from turkey itself into account . 
  yes , the barrier is 4 % . 
  i do n't know how much the results from sections in turkey will influence their results . 
  according to exit polls - around 2 % , but it should rise a bit . 
  white people just do n't have nipples * this * big . 
  news flash - brest is somehow further away from moscow than stettin . 
   occupation of poland increased the distance between the germans and the soviets . 
  welcome to today 's edition of `` alternative facts '' , where 0 km is a bigger distance than 600 km , brought to you by the russian federation and its bots . 
  this is the real deal . 
  there was no actual instance of cavalry attacking tanks , that 's a [ myth ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charge_at_krojanty ) . 
  so much for your knowledge on the subject . 
  there was no such thing as an ` inevitable war ' by august 1939 , what made it possible is the de facto alliance between germany and ussr . 
  also , if someone on the other side of a barrier state like poland acts aggressively and you 're afraid , you do n't remove the barrier between yourself and agression . 
  this is plain stupidity and i do n't think stalin was stupid at all . 
  no-one knows if the polish army could have stood a chance against germany because it fought the soviet army as well . 
  this conversation is a great example of russian mentality though - even if there is no prior arrangement to attack poland , it 's fine to kick and rob the fallen cause he ca n't defend himself . 
  keep in mind , there was such prior agreement , and germany attacked poland knowing the ussr would attack as well . 
  no need to deny it , the world knows it anyway . 
  this is false - the polish defence was not only active on 17 september , but it actually lasted up to 6 october , more time fighting the soviets and germans than the germans alone . 
  the mental gymnastics to somehow excuse the ussr or invading neutral countries and starting wwii is astounding , but it wo n't persuade anyone with the slightest sense of realism . 
  because it 's got little to nothing to do with the point i raised - that ussr and germany together started wwii by invading poland ( and then the ussr invaded finland , the baltics , bukovina , etc. ), 
  this has little to do with the soviet role in starting the war . 
  because they agreed to divide eastern europe between themselves and even attacked the same country - poland . 
  r/evilbuidings has leaked, 
  also , keep in mind that it 's in the utmost interest of the ussr or its successor russia to play the victim and instill the narrative of being the victim in order to mask its role of one of the countries primarily responsible for the outbreak of wwii . 
  rakia capital of the world !, 
  checkmate . 
  good , now you can unsubscribe from the american website reddit.com . 
  i come from the region with the highest rate of depopulation in the eu - northern bulgaria . 
  this is the single biggest drawback of our integration to the west - a shitton of people , usually the more qualified , educated and capable - just packed their shit and went away . 
  also quite a lot of bulgarians in the region around edirne launched the [ ilinden-preobrazhenie uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ilinden%e2%80%93preobrazhenie_uprising ) . 
  most of the bulgarian population was either expelled or killed during the second balkan war in 1913 . 
  sofia , the dankest city in the balkans . 
  but it 's nowhere near to social justice and cohesiveness , something that has been heavily advertised here . 
  russia is ridiculously unequal . 
  yet a lot of people in my country regard it as an example of social justice . 
  you do have a point . 
  what about gyros languages ? 
  but ... but ... muh `` ukrainians ca n't survive the winter '' narrative !, 
  maybe my metabolism is slower - last time i actually measured my intake i usually ate between 1600 and 2000 kcal a day - and i ran 5k 's twice a week and did a bit of weight lifting , which is definitely easier that ` moderate ' exercise by the calculator 's standards but not fully sedentary either . 
  one obvious explanation is that i underestimated my calorie intake though i doubt it . 
  if i started eating 3400 kcal a day i would gain weight pretty quickly . 
  looks a bit like those dreams where you 're falling infinitely long . 
  that was my first thought as well - 3500 a day is ridiculously high - almost twice what i eat , and i 'm a fairly active 80kg guy . 
   so you usually do n't see random blokes from the street come in to exercise and it is more of a perk to be part of a membership . 
  although they do n't cost as much in bulgaria , normal gyms are also considered a bit expensive . 
  even though we 're lazy as fuck , at least in the last few years there 's a positive trend of more people doing street fitness , crossfit or just exercising outside . 
  also more joggers , more cyclists etc. 
   sofia is such a turd . 
  there 's simply no denying it . 
  i think it 's great so you can fuck right off . 
   iirc , the pomaks were also bogomils and this played a role in them becoming muslim and subsequently becoming their own ethnicity . 
  how come pomaks are their own ethnicity , they 're as ethnically bulgarian as me . 
  i think they considered it back in the 60s , now i guess it 's far too late , the population has little idea what these letters actually sound like . 
  ( \u0463 has dual purpose , it can sound like `` ja '' in eastern dialects ( mljako - milk ) , or like `` e '' in western ( mleko - milk ) . 
  this is pure cultural suicide if you ask me . 
  it 's sad , considering we first developed the damn thing back in the middle ages . 
  thanks , commies , for murdering our beautiful language by removing glorious letters like \u0463 and \u046a just to make it closer to russian .
