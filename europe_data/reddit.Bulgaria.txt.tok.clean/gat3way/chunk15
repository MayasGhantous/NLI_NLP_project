  then welcome to the dilemma we still have today . 
  yep , and the reason is ... https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/10957541_10153135997893049_6366401913098367748_n.jpg?oh=b6c108d85f034042c0d1bcc98284286c&amp;oe=5615c153 german tourists en-route to greece . 
  nope , we do n't want to feed the greeks . 
  i would personally never ever trust anything that comes out of russian officials . 
  p.s i am orthodox and slavic . 
  i think that is a derogatory term used for old female farts . 
  p.s never mind , i do n't speak bulgarian very well even though it was meant to be my native language and i have like ~ 35 years of practice . 
  still find it hard to communicate with others . 
  wow , truly patriotic ... well except for that '' \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0441 s \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438 '' part which i personally find weird . 
  but that 's probably due to the `` little town mayor blows 150k for a limo cause he needs to be properly represented at business meetings '' type of news . 
  not acquainted with the situation in romania , but i guess it 's more or less the same . 
  here are the most recent events here from past month : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flcz_gycglq it 's about two cases actually , one is in a village not far away from the greek border , gypsies illegally occupied agricultural land to vote for the past mayor started a huge fight with locals and then the motorcycle gangs and football hooligans came on the next day . 
  police prevented escallation and there were just a few arrested for hooliganism and attacking a news reporters car . 
  it was mostly about peaceful protesting . 
  the govt reacted in the most incompetent way - initially by installing cctv cameras all over the village then they were forced to start bulldozing illegal buildings . 
  as they started , that was attacked in court and bulldozing is now halted , so i expect that this will sooner or later escalate again . 
  the other case is from sofia , where a group of gypsies suddenly attacked some teens that told them to turn down the volume of the music they were playing . 
  the teens were badly beaten with axes , baseball bats and steel rods and luckily there were no fatalities . 
  on the next day it was full of police and football hooligans there , but this time the police was n't that successful at preventing the violence and a number of roma houses were attacked , stones , bombs and bottles thrown at them , people beaten , stuff like this . 
  p.s in fact , nazi graffiti like '' \u0446\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043f\u0443\u043d '' ( literally `` turn gypsies to soap '' which refers to a nazi practice of using human fats to produce soap ) are quite common here , especially in poorer commieblock neighbourhoods , especially at those neighbouring roma ghettos . 
  i think that sparked a lot of controversies and generally it is accepted as rather rude racist slur and you can get jailed for speaking shit like this . 
  the reaction of neonazis was to change it to '' \u0446\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043d '' ( `` send gypsies to saturn '' ) - cause it sounds similar yet does not bring nazi analogies . 
  p.s2 : security camera footage of a group of roma guys from the illegal ghetto in the village i talked about , gathering for the `` battle scene '' where the conflict with the locals erupted : http://vbox7.com/play:5c132771da you see kids with sticks and stuff , crazy . 
  p.s3 : now i remember going to a football game years ago ( think it was bulgaria-ireland ) . 
  i was late to buy a ticket , so the only one i got was in the sector which is occupied by levski team 's hooligans . 
  then before the game a group of kids were going around the field , carrying a big bulgarian flag . 
  some of them were roma . 
  i remember the boneheads around me started shouting stuff like `` slay the black monkeys '' and throwing bottles at them . 
  not to mention , i felt rather embarassed . 
  p.s4 : having said that , most of my contacts with roma people were from my childhood both at the village where my grandparents lived and the neighbourhood we lived which had a couple of roma houses in it . 
  i have never been robbed by gypsies , but once i had to run from a group of them that was aggressive towards us for some reason . 
  in the village , i used to play football with roma kids , there was nothing like hate or racism . 
  no need to ask - use google earth and take a virtual tour of the neighbourhoods near `` zapaden park '' ( west park ) and around the airport in sofia . 
  or the north-eastern parts of plovdiv . 
  actually , here is the best example of failed roma integration . 
  at the end of communist era , a state company ( some factory ) built several commieblocks for its employees ( common practice then ) . 
  it went bankrupt after communism was over . 
  the municipality decided to accomodate homeless roma in them . 
  fast-forward 10 years , this is how the commieblocks looked like : http://nreporter.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/%d0%b1%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%ba-20.jpg they had to bulldoze them because the buildings were unsuitable and dangerous for living . 
  gypsies took out everything metallic to sell , they even started destroying the concrete panels to take out the steel rods . 
  they used to light fires in the appartments . 
  some even succeeded to bring horses and other animals in . 
  the green area around the buildings became a landfill area . 
  gypsies protested against tearing down the buildings and afaik there were court appeals by some roma human rights organizations . 
  finally the municipality won the case and destroyed the blocks . 
  i think most of the inhabitants refused to move in the places that municipality provided . 
  it does n't get better with time . 
  corrupt politicians use the roma population as dumb paid voters . 
  especially in local mayor elections in small towns . 
  if a mayor at place like this wants to get reelected and popular vote is against him , he would promise a group of gypsies free land to settle . 
  of course this does not happen and they move in illegally , but municipal inspectors close their eyes to this . 
  then crime skyrockets and sooner or later a minor incident turns into a violent fight like tens or hundreds of bulgarians or turks against the same number of roma . 
  the special police units have to come and restore the order . 
  particularily bad case was when members of a roma mafia boss family ( dealing with smuggling and illegal alchohol ) killed two young people in a village - what happened after that is nationalists , football hooligans and motorbike gangs from all the country gathered , attacked the roma mafia houses , even heavily armed police units did not stop them , they put the houses on fire and those roma guys never got back in the village . 
  i think most of the people working in the it industry here that came from outside eu are from ukraine and macedonia . 
  i see more and more people from ukraine and that is related to the war i guess . 
  and as far as macedonians - most of them studied in a university here and remained in the country . 
  the language is very similar for them and i guess salaries in the sector in sofia are higher than those in skopje . 
  people from mk and ukraine get bulgarian citizenship much easier than other nationalities for a number of reasons though . 
  i do n't know . 
  the last time i was in greece was just about two weeks before that shitstorm started and i did not object to not having proper receipts ( considered them to be a waste of time and would probably cause unneeded conflict ) . 
  i actually do n't know what would i do if i am in greece now . 
  card payments would be an option but right now they are problematic . 
  and in fact , in most cases you ca n't for example pay with your card for a drink at the beach . 
  well in a way , as strict tax authority control is still needed . 
  machine receipts by themselves do not guarantee that the tax officer would not get bribed to `` forget about '' an incident for example . 
  yet , evidence of the tax evasion would exist on the other hand . 
  and i do n't think it is very effective if they do n't have online connection with the tax authority servers - the machine memory is not that `` tamper resistant '' and there were some frauds here related to this . 
  it is much more hard to cheat a system that does real-time reporting of transactions . 
  though i guess it still has vulnerabilities . 
  printed receipts are issued by machines and all transactions are stored on its memory . 
  on tax inspections , transaction data is retrieved and checked with the declared profits . 
  at least that is how it functioned here . 
  this had its issues too so at some point they demanded that all the machines need to be connected to the tax authority database online . 
  sorry to bring an offtopic question , but does the name `` daskalaki '' has anything to do with teaching ? 
  that would explain the etymology of a word occasionally used in my language . 
  have n't followed most of the greece discussions on reddit , but i had a very negative attitude towards greece 's position initially when s *** hit the fan . 
  even though i have worked for a greek company and i personally know a number of greeks and i have visited greece on a number of occasions , not only leisure . 
  the prevailing attitude on most media does n't help much and basically the public opinion shared by the majority goes along the lines of `` they deserve it because they are lazy , they do n't think about the consequences , they think they have kind of privileged status , europe should stop feeding this spoiled nation '' and so on . 
  now generalizing people is stupid and especially the `` greeks are lazy '' part is crap - for all i can tell the set of `` lazy '' people here percent-wise is higher than the set of `` lazy '' people in greece . 
  i also read some statistics that more or less changed my mind . 
  anyway in my humble opinion , greece is more to blame for this and by greece i do n't mean greeks as people ( and not even the ***** leftist anarchists so common in athens ) . 
  it 's the greek state which is horribly mismanaged . 
  and to someone that comes from a poorer country that had lots of issues due to bad state policies and poor management , they are immediately obvious . 
  i can give many examples , some of them like i 've never paid a single cent of toll tax on egnatia odos highway for so many time until i saw the tolls somewhere near thessaloniki and was surprised to find out that it 's not free . 
  and i 've driven there for many kilometers on a number of occasions . 
  perhaps all my routes magically bypassed the toll payment points , but this was in no way intentional . 
  bars , cafeterias and stuff especially at seaside , but also in big cities most of the time never give you a proper cash receipt the same type that you get in a supermarket or a petrol station . 
  instead you get some sheet of paper with a hand-written amount on it . 
  i know why is that cause i 've seen that happening here in the 90s - tax evasion . 
  anyway i hope greece gets out of that crisis , that region here is not `` easy '' one and having the only neighbouring developed country sink into a severe crisis and instability will definitely be a problem for us as well . 
  actually , i 've mislead you . 
  first one was in 1990 , not 1992 . 
  and in 1997 they defaulted on the domestic debt , not foreign one . 
  it was due to mismanaged socialist program to bailout ineffective state-owned companies . 
  i did not quite remember the 1990 events as i was too young then . 
  but i do remember well the 1997 events - was n't a particularily good period , there was hyperinflation . 
  it was then when socialist government fell and privatization started and the currency board was installed . 
  there is a document that describes what happened in more detail : http://www.cesr.ibn.bg/publications/rd_trcrisis.pdf, 
  i believe we will readily return the favor .
