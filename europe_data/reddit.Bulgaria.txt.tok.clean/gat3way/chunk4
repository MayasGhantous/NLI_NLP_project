  i always wondered if some parts of `` diaries of elena causescu '' were real indeed or not . 
  but frankly many of them were common for the whole comecon block , e.g the tunnels below bucharest - we have the same urban myths here . 
  it belongs [ there ] ( http://freesofiatour.com/blog/museum-of-communism ), 
  the guys that did that are not anonymous actually , they gave interviews later . 
  another form of their art was this : http://sofiapress.bg/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dn_30th_anniversary_timeline4.jpg it is mocking the [ `` bulgarian louvre '' ] ( http://bnr.bg/en/post/100421974/bulgarian-louvre-expects-new-name ) - or that is how the media started calling the new bulgarian museum of art in sofia ( they painted it right in front of it ) . 
  it gets messy here and is probably hard to understand by someone not well acquainted with life here , but in short the idea is that the politicians in general ( the minister of culture in that particular case ) are a bunch of uneducated populist guys that love to boast about spending eu and public money ... on `` louvres '' for example ( there goes the `` louvre '' - `` lover '' link ) . 
  not that anyone denies that or approve it , but many of them had their reasons to do that - since quite a lot of the people serving the army were the same people that you guys were so nice to force to exile . 
  so i believe they considered it as taking their revenge . 
  i do n't think so . 
  but that was the case in ww1 indeed . 
  the russian navy then also shelled coastal towns here . 
  so yes - unlike ww2 , in ww1 we actually fought with russia , both on land and in the sea . 
  there was no hitler 's army when they came , so yes - the only soviet heroes that died here were those who pillaged alcohol from village houses ... and those who were shot by their superiors for deserting . 
  we actually never ever fought against ussr in ww2 . 
  the king 's opinion on that matter was `` always with germany , never against russia '' . 
  we were n't formally in war with them until just several days prior to ussr invasion and it was the ussr that unilaterally declared war on us . 
  which did n't make a lot of sense because at that time , the pro-axis government already resigned , bulgaria declared neutrality , the germans left the country and our army retreated from yugoslavia . 
  yet the russians invaded , met absolutely no armed resistance , they basically occupied the country , installed their puppet government and what followed were pogroms , people 's courts , belene labor camps and so on . 
  therefore , it is not unexpected that this monument is often referred to as `` the monument of occupiers '' . 
  even without all that vandalism , the smell of urine that surrounds it , speaks enough about the attitude lots of people have towards it . 
  well the only soviet soldiers that sacrificed their life in bulgaria in ww2 were those that died of alcohol poisoning . 
  meh , it 's much more difficult nowadays , they installed some expensive ptz ip cameras that stream full hd with night mode ir leds and the police comes in like 5 minutes when they see people loitering at it . 
  which makes me wonder what 's so special about that place - when i had a car accident , i had to wait for traffic police to come for more than an hour . 
  but you can have a good fun with them with some laser pointers . 
  besides , rumors are they were unable to wire them , so they used 802.11 which means lots of potential fun . 
  i wonder why the russians are so mad about vandalizing the soviet army monument when ukraine , belarus , georgia , etc do n't give a shit about it . 
  we need to make balkan stronk by sending them to you , 
  racists !, 
  now we will send even more of them at you !, 
  errr thracians not , it is unlikely . 
  but many people made points like that actually , especially when it fits their ideological views . 
  for example it is common for the nationalists/nazi people to claim that we 're direct descendants of the proto-bulgarian tribes with all those pagan symbolic , khans , invading armies and crap often in contrast to the `` slavic subhumans '' we definitely are n't according to them . 
  then again , during the communism , the communists tried to persuade anyone that we are pure 100 % slavs , any other folks that lived here were just too insignificant and were either assimilated or killed . 
  of course that means we 're like brothers with the russians who commanded the red parade then . 
  otoh the thracian equivalent of that crap is just not that popular and the way thracians are widely perceived here is like `` uhmmm they are kind of bulgarized greek tribes '' . 
  another widely claimed thing is `` uhmmmm yes , they were something like an amorphic mass - when slavs came to the balkans , thracians just became slavs '' . 
  anyway , the history of the region is so violent and so many genes mixed here thorough the ages that i do n't even think we have much in common with the medieval bulgarian empires - even the old bulgarian slavonic they spoke and wrote in is today barely understandable and sounds more like polish or ukrainian than bulgarian . 
  that said , i think the guys in macedonia have lost their mind with all that ancient identity bullshit . 
  i can understand to some extent why they are doing this , but they just take it to the extremes . 
  it is a pity when history is being rewriten/made up to suit your current political views . 
  anyway from what i 've seen most people there do n't even care about that shit and it all comes from their government mostly . 
  good . 
  now put landmines at your border with macedonia , i am sure putin will approve . 
  that hate does n't really exist the way you think about it . 
  we actually do n't hate each other here . 
  yet it is a good reason to start a pub fight or to fuel violence at football games . 
  do n't listen to what people say , because bashing the neighbours here is one thing we are very good at and it looks dramatic , in reality though it 's all striking poses and talking bullshit . 
  noone will ever get berserk and start killing people because of this . 
  balkans are just ... well kind of weird . 
  i feel for you guys ... but you do it wrong . 
  do n't be surprised they choose to pass through your country rather than our . 
  all the money we spent on stupid fences , funky night vision gadgets and ir barriers for border police plus mobilizing more units to the border were useless until we found out the right approach . 
  i admit i was outright furious at our government then , but in fact they did it right . 
  a syrian tv came here to report how we treated the migrants . 
  we kinda helped them , let them witness some examples and the result was this : http://offnews.bg/news/%d0%9e%d0%b1%d1%89%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be_4/%d0%a1%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%b9%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0-%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%b8a-%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b7%d0%b0-%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%ba-%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%88%d0%b8-%d0%b3%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8-%d0%b1%d0%b8%d1%8f%d1%82-%d0%b1%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%86%d0%b8-%d0%b2%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%be_528600.html media propaganda that is , very successful though . 
  now they avoid us and go through your country instead . 
  sorry for that . 
  you should do the same . 
  we can even have a competition , whose border police looks the most brutal . 
  that 's wrong , we actually have about 1/2 of thrace , the rest is in greece and turkey . 
  i think the only such `` region '' we may claim bulgarian is moesia , dobrogea/dobrudja is equally divided between bulgaria and romania . 
  people in most orthodox countries do that actually . 
  the only exception probably being greece . 
  it is actually wanted . 
  and weird as that sounds , even bulgaria is eu 's # 6 for asylum seekers from syria and # 5 for those from afghanistan ( source : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/b7/five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png ) . 
  and we are certainly not rich . 
  and fatass rich western eu guys keep telling us it is not big of an issue and that we should house some more migrants deported from their countries . 
  easy to say . 
  but our economy and unemployment is just slowly recovering from the crisis . 
  btw you guys in romania are just lucky . 
  we got the northern parts of the sofia 's center already becoming middle east/africa , population-wise . 
  it feels weird to walk there nowadays . 
  and honestly it costs a lot to integrate them and only a few of them are willing to , most of them are quick to turn to crimes . 
  i am afraid , we would finally decide to `` integrate '' them the way we are used to here in the balkans and that is n't the most civilized way . 
  well that 's about the official number they claim , could be less or more . 
  also it does n't mean a lot because most of them are not religious , do n't ever go to a mosque or a church and there is n't much that separates orthodox from muslim roma . 
  funny thing is the muslim roma for example celebrate orthodox saints e.g saint george 's day ( sveti georgi / gergiovden ) is widely celebrated by muslim roma , they call it `` erdelezi '' or something like that . 
  muslims though do n't celebrate it . 
  btw from what i know , bulgarian turks ( which are muslims ) hate roma and especially muslim roma way more than bulgarians do for reasons i do n't really know . 
  but you rarely see any roma living in a village that has predominantly turkish population , they just do n't tolerate them and do not allow them there . 
  i have actually seen that . 
  do you think orthodox islam allows use of alcohol ? 
  yet i 've seen those wannabe wahhabits drinking rakia and beer . 
  quite a lot actually . 
  that 's in the hometown my wife is from which is well known for that kind of roma ghetto , the saudi foundation that operates there and that retarded bearded wannabe-arab gypos . 
  i think they mostly do that to get the saudi money ( cause indeed the saudis are dumb enough to pay them ) . 
  and it is common for the media to blow mass hysteria about isis in the ghetto and stuff and they often end up with the police arresting someone for alleged affiliation with islamists just to release them shortly for missing proofs . 
  it is usually like that : the nationalist parties start the scandal , media feed on it and the police finally wasting the taxpayers money to extinguish the fire . 
  it certainly looks scary ( the first time i saw that myself was in a kaufland supermarket right next to the ghetto , it was full of guys that looked like terrorists ) . 
  but that does n't mean anyone will behead you or blow himself up . 
  actually there was never any case of muslim religious-related violence there , just the `` usual '' crime and sometimes racist attacks . 
  we share no borders with slovakia obviously . 
  39 % of the roma here are muslims . 
  technically a minority yes , but not a small one . 
  ok i get it - the so-called refugees are adventurous guys that like to spend a lot of money on doing illegal and dangerous actions plus they want to travel through as many countries as they can before getting to their final destination . 
  flights are boring . 
  this does not oblige the respective countries to approve the applications , nor does it set the criteria for approval - it might well be theoretically `` we accept christians only '' . 
  either way , blaming slovakia is just unfair . 
  you see , those guys pay thousands of euros to some traffickers to get them through eu borders . 
  a plane ticket from istanbul to bruxelles costs much less than that , it 's much faster and much more safe .
