  but your country does not just happily embrace them at the airport passport countrol and does not let them in to wait for their asylum approval , instead they get them on the next plane back . 
  if it was n't like that , we would n't have the migrant issues here in eastern europe or at least it would n't be that sharp . 
  does that mean that your country does n't follow the international conventions ? 
  the obligation exists under article 33 of the 1951 refugee convention not to return a refugee to a country of territory where he/she would be at risk of persecution . 
  they would not be at risk of persecution in turkey where they came from . 
  thus , no law obliges slovakia to grant them asylum . 
  it does not prohibit you from accepting only christian economic migrants either . 
  well no law forces us to accept migrants too . 
  since most of them come from syria and iraq , by international conventions they are refugees in turkey . 
  once they cross turkey-greece/turkey-bulgaria borders , they are no more refugees , they are economic migrants . 
  and there is no law that forces us to accept economic migrants . 
  many are n't though . 
  some are muslims . 
  and some are even brainwashed by some saudi organizations to dress and behave like salafists . 
  otoh that 's the worst thing they can throw money at - gypsies just grow those islamist beards , pretend to be religious then take their money and spend them on drinks . 
  actually the salaries in the it sector are n't very low at all as most of the customers are foreign and companies do n't want to lose skilled workforce migrating to us/western europe . 
  salaries are typically at least 3-4x as high as the average one , senior developers typically earn ~ eur 2000-3000 which actually buys you more than working the same in berlin as everything is way cheaper here . 
  the biggest problem though is that there is already a shortage of qualified workforce . 
  also the universities are not well prepared to handle the demand . 
  and more than most - access to venture capital is very limited . 
  it is limited in europe as compared to us and it is limited in ee as compared to uk or germany . 
  nevertheless we still have successful companies developing their own products used around the world - e.g chaos group ( which develops the [ v-ray rendering engine ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v-ray ) ) , [ olimex ] ( https://www.olimex.com/ ) or [ telerik ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telerik ) - although it got acquired by an us company recently . 
  gypsies agree . 
  hm that was an interesting table : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/b/b7/five_main_citizenships_of_%28non-eu%29_asylum_applicants%2c_2014_%28number%2c_rounded_figures%29_yb15_iii.png, 
  well that was not a government decision , more like the pool owners one , news like that were common some time ago ( via google translate , sorry ) : https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=bg&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fclubz.bg%2f25170-basejn_zabranen_za_sirijci_i_cigani&amp;edit-text=, 
  build walls at the border , house them near gypsies , make them go through the bureaucratic machine , create media hysteria about islamists flooding the country then ignore the reaction of the nazi guys and nationalists and more than most - do not let them use any swimming pools . 
  then they will flee to western europe as fast as they can . 
  is it that bad ? 
  tirana 's airport is not very busy even by our standards so it should n't be such a mess . 
  or you mean stuff like `` missing items '' ? 
  i 'd rather just keep them in the hand luggage ( besides , i do n't usually bring expensive items when i travel so i do n't bother ) . 
  it was in the late 90s and i never bought it actually , my parents did . 
  i just happened to drive it a couple of times . 
  not into that offroad stuff though . 
  why would you never fly to albania ? 
  hm sorry i was thinking about that kind of uaz : http://img30.olx.bg/images_prodavalnikcom/82677768_2_585x461_prodavam-uaz-452d-snimki.jpg i know there is a suv uaz , but i do n't know why the `` uazka '' one was the first thing that came to my mind . 
  do they still produce them ? 
  my license does not permit me to drive uaz :( but i would love to try anyway . 
  or one of those belaz monsters . 
  you 've ever driven a niva ? 
  i guess not , your kidneys would have remembered it . 
  though i admit i never tried it off the road , i think this car is for people that value the car 's integrity more than their own health . 
  from the bright side , at least it 's kind of free fitness , you train your arm muscles ... though more so for the right hand that you switch gears with . 
  how could i forget that , 
  greek . 
  too bad the only words i know are `` kalimera '' , `` prosohi '' , `` parakalo '' , `` odos '' , `` exodos '' , `` nero '' and several more i do n't remember at the moment . 
  plus the words that came from greek like `` beton '' , `` krevat '' and so on . 
  i want ... just waiting until they start a direct flight , cause i 've heard horror stories about having to drive to albanian coast . 
  oh , we have tens of verbs formed around the `` eba '' one ... meaning almost anything you can imagine , from the simple `` fuck '' in several additional forms with slightly different meanings ( like `` fucked for some time '' , `` got laid '' , etc ) through `` leave '' , `` cheat '' , `` fuck someone up '' ( at least 3 different words , each having slightly different meaning ) , `` continue fucking '' , `` get broken '' , `` get wasted '' , `` make fun of '' to even some monstrous but thanks god rare ones like `` nadeba '' which is hard to translate really . 
  unfortunately , it is hard even for me to properly explain the fucked up situation with all the tenses in bulgarian language . 
  we have stuff like `` bil sam se bil napil '' which is like `` allegedly according to someone i have got drunk , i have no memory and it is uncertain if that really happened '' . 
  say its something like past perfect unconfirmed narrative . 
  but then you might have `` bil sam se bil napil i sam se bil ojenil '' which is `` allegedly according to someone i have got drunk , i have no memories of that , but it must have happened because apparently i 've got married somewhere around that time . 
  which is past perfect narrative with some clues that make it sound plausible . 
  now if you try to literally translate , first one would be something like `` i have had been myself got drunk '' and the second would be directly translated to something like `` i have had been myself got drunk and i have got married '' . 
  another example is `` shtial sam bil da bada '' - which in english sounds like nonsense , closest translation like `` there is possibility according to someone that i would have been ... '' . 
  which is something like future perfect yet doubtful tense and directly translated it would be like `` i would have had been to be '' or something . 
  actually , tenses are complicated and even obvious things do not mean what you might think . 
  for example the common curse `` ebal sam ti maikata '' directly translated means `` i have fucked your mom '' but it implies not something that already happened in the past , but something that is going to happen soon in the future . 
  usually meaning something like `` i do n't care about you , see what i would do right now '' . 
  but again probably not a good explanation . 
  wondering if the tenses are so fucked up in other slavic languages , i have n't seen such `` verbal constructions '' but i am not that good at them either . 
  i do n't think they have those in macedonian which is really close to bulgarian . 
  besides the anti-nato , anti-eu , pro-russia party support is around 4 % . 
  down from about 6-7 % at its peak . 
  i am not sure they will be even represented in the next parliament . 
  sorry if russian media tells you otherwise . 
  we should call you guys as you are well known for holding referendums . 
  especially on foreign soil . 
  wait what did i just say ... no . 
  stay home and enjoy putler !, 
  the incest of technology , the plague of slavic world , the end of orthodoxy as we know it . 
  for god 's sake - never !, 
  shale gas - the enemy number one of orthodox slavs . 
  nothing contradictory - it is about violently establishing peace and love . 
  is it true that people in crete can pronounce `` j '' like in `` java '' or `` job '' ? 
  this one : http://www.imot.bg/pcgi/imot.cgi?act=5&amp;adv=1j131108407233530&amp;slink=1xf6bp&amp;f1=1, 
  ruse is a nice town kind of unique here with its architecture which was heavily influenced by austro-hungary ( reason being it was the biggest city and the financial center at the time bulgaria was liberated from the ottomans ) . 
  it has a very nice downtown with all those old buildings which recently got large parts of it rennovated . 
  so if i had just one day , i 'd have some walks around the center - it is probably the most pedestrian-friendly one here and it is certainly beautiful both daytime and nighttime . 
  there is also a large park right next to it that is nice for walks in the summer but it is not that well maintained as it used to be . 
  you can do shopping in the downtown , there is also a big mall but it is several kilometers away and you need to get a bus or taxi to get there . 
  apart from this , there are beautiful places just outside the town , but you are unlikely to visit them if you have just one day . 
  there is a natural park south of the place with beautiful nature , a river has cut canyons in limestone rocks and there are beautiful villages there - most of the tourist landmarks are there - includiding churches and monasteries in the rocks and the remains of a medieval town with castle walls on a hill . 
  the small villages in the natural park are just beautiful , some of them have local wineries that make good wine . 
  anyway , i do n't think she 'd have enough time to visit them . 
  ruse itself has a great downtown , but apart from it it is just like any other place in bulgaria . 
  it is not a tourist city , it 's more like an industrial/logistic center , so there wo n't be many tourists there too . 
  although they are working on developing its tourist potential . 
  p.s they finally opened the museum of nature . 
  it has a huge aquarium that is populated by species typical for the danube river ecosystems , it is worth visiting . 
  also the historical museum right next to it . 
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lebg8qn1a8&amp;t=0m11s this has three of the most common , one after another . 
  but yes , it 's mostly about your mother 's cunt/ass/mouth , being fucked in different ways . 
  or about someone being a homosexual . 
  i like it when i hear something like `` mrasen pederast , da te eba v gaza '' - first one is `` fucking pederast '' ( utter disgust ) followed by `` i will fuck you in the ass '' which does n't make much sense if you are disgusted by gays i guess . 
  other typical ones : `` govnar '' / `` lainar '' / `` yazh laina '' etc - means you are shit / eat shit etc recently i heard the funniest one by a taxi driver : `` shti prasna gaza s hilti '' - which means something like `` i will rape your ass with a hilti pneumatic drill '' . 
  anyway , hands down , serbs are more creative in that aspect . 
  p.s i like that : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uipb_fqc6do supposed to be in bulgarian , but the only thing i can understand are the curses . 
  those guys are some rednecks from the mountains , apparently arguing about some money .
