we agree with the ban . 
  especially , as mentioned , that is a very recent thing and only in that city around that mosque . 
  rumour has it , the men are being paid for that ( to keep the women veiled ) from the local arab representatives . 
  that 's the whole thing , not like they ` suddenly ' became true believers . 
  there were interviews on tv with some women from that group , they could n't even explain why or what they want these veils . 
  i see , yes , in a way you can say it like that in bulgarian ; but it 's not common, 
  well , no ? 
  bulgaria was always ally with germany ( in both wars ) check your facts on wikipedia , at least ... in ww2 , we `` switched '' only when the russians came , occupied and stayed . 
  then installed the puppet government which switch sides and actually send troops on the front . 
  before that , we did not really participated in military actions ( while technically supporting the axis ) . 
  our ruler then , king boris was very good politician , who unfortunately died abruptly . 
  and we managed to save almost all our jewish citizens from the nazis, 
  that is not , actually true . 
  there were the '' \u0411\u0417\u041d\u0421 '' and '' \u041e\u0424 '' , and they were getting some votes thought the '' \u0411\u041a\u041f '' usually won with 99.9 % , 
  but he did n't stopped it , on the contrary - build them  so that armies with trucks can move fast, 
  brits and frenchies have actually messed up the world quite a lot , especially around ww1 with all the artificial divisions of the middle east . 
  well . 
  the prevailing opinion in , say , bulgaria is the opposite . 
  you have to walk around the region ( bulgaria , macedonia , serbia ) and visit historical places to get the real perspective . 
  there are records , signs , carvings etc which point to the fact that nobody really gave up their children just like that . 
  also , we call the ottoman rule of the region ( balkans ) ` yoke ' . 
  not even occupation . 
  hope that gives you the perspective of how things are seen this side of the border , 
  they have until 20th of jan , 2017 to reach that goal, 
  somehow , looking back at history , these things does not happen very easy . 
  just cause there is a ` treaty ' . 
  i 'd call this a false sense of security . 
  preferably , close to somme river, 
  problem is , napoleon thought the same . 
  then , hitler . 
  you know the results . 
  so it 's not that simple , like `` we 've got the better equipment and our tanks have renault euro6 diesel engines '' if it were like that , wars in the middle-east ( or afghanistan ) should 've been `` won '' long ago ... 
  well , that is mostly in asia , not europe , 
  yeah right . 
  like it 's so much clearer to write ' 2016-11-06 ' vs ' 06-11-2016 ', 
  heh how is that news i wonder . 
  in bulgaria , there are even shops which sell such goods imported directly from westerneurope ( germany , france , uk etc ) . 
  stuff like detergents , soaps , packed foods ... and there is a difference . 
  mondelez and nestle both have big factories in bg , but the chocolates and candies they produce ` for the local market ' are total crap - incomparable with * the same thing * one can buy in , say , switzerland, 
   but the ruskies do n't fuck around when it comes to farm machinery . 
  by using john deere instead of \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441, 
  yeah it 's called the sun, 
  it is still uncomprehensive to me how all these ex-yugo nations started hating each other . 
  and it 's not only the regular muslims vs. christians thing , its like all vs all ? 
  and all speak de-facto the same language , just call it with different names ( do n't even start me on that , that 's the reality ), 
  i wonder where would they house them ... conditions on the turkish border were total crap, 
  bulgaria , 2nd of june of every year : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f4xdveg_8i it 's a remembrance day for all who fell for bulgarian freedom, 
  hard to believe the range is all that problematic , especially for city-commutes . 
  tesla 's range is almost the same as of a mid-size petrol car ( well , not diesel . 
  but diesel has tons of other problems as we know ) . 
  range is not everything . 
  can you , maybe elaborate a bit on what is `` not all that great '' - it 's really interesting, 
  well it 's not just that ; the backdoor regulations seem to have is that ` protect the engine ' thingie , which is exploited loosely . 
  emission control will switch off below 17-18c or above 33c , at high speeds , at higher altitudes ( like ,  1000m ) at this at that ... and it 's all ` legal ' here is what gm/opel admits ( read comments as well ) : http://europe.autonews.com/article/20160518/ane/160519860/opel-admits-using-shut-off-device-german-minister-says, 
  heh plenty of that in bulgaria as well ... 
  i guess : during communism , `` something happened '' to original owners of the house ... then it was re-settled by the government , and after many years left part officialy bought by 3rd party ( from the government or somth . ) ... 
  while the right side still belongs to the original owners ... whose descendants maybe live in la or nyc and never ever been to poland ... 
  it 's about time to really get rid of diesels and move to electric ... 
  lot 's of bulgarian spoken - very interesting is that the bessarabia region ? 
  in bg we use only 2 gauges for tramways : - narrow = 1000mm - wide ( or normal ) = 1435mm we have skoda tramways for both of them . 
  they are different models altogether , even though from outside they look alike . 
  it 's amazing, 
  so nice !!, 
  same architecture can be found in many small cities across the whole balkans region - in bulgaria , greece , macedonia ... 
  that on the photo is not wide-track though , but in general you are correct , 
  yep it passes thru there, 
  no , the old ones are still around for the record , they look like that : http://inews.bg/pictures/1342886_375_282_4x3.jpg, 
  simply maybe true . 
  now you are just giving @svarog51 ideas . 
  and business opportunities . 
  true , but the reasons for that ( codification ) were in a way forced by history , for good or bad . 
  people in the region were just speaking bulgarian , serbian , greek or albanian back then . 
  makes sense , macedonian is a mix of bulgarian and serbian . 
  a forced mix i 'd say , but that 's just imho ( do n't get triggered ) still closer to bulgarian though , especially to the dialects spoken @south_west . 
  to me ( a bulgarian ) its understandable up to ~ 90-95 % , and sounds the same as my grand-grandma spoke . 
  and she was not even from south_west region . 
  sure . 
  but the language is the same . 
  you ca n't change facts just because you wished them to be false . 
  call it serbocroan \u00ae language ( or just go with west-bulgarian ), 
  yeah , dunno ; we say sasho , not sasha - that would ( can ) be a lady, 
  ... and in couple of months , we 'll be back on the streets . 
  we 've seen that more than once ... 
  i 'm getting tired of it 25 + years doing exactly that , actually ... 
  just say minorities , not turks . 
  i know what you mean . 
  but we did try to expel them 30years back . 
  true , true ... 
  good question . 
  and the funniest thing is , they now say it was all `` da , bulgaria '' 's fault . 
  i am glad people saw thru them ( at least in sofia and abroad ) , and did not supported them much . 
  at least radan resigned at the end . 
  they are also in space https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contents_of_the_voyager_golden_record, 
  data from votes in turkey has yet to come , so you never know ; but by local ( bulgaria only ) exit-polls they get a minimal # of votes, 
  gerb has won the snap parliamentary elections for the 44th parliament with 32.8 % ahead of its main opponent bsp -- 28.4 % , reported bgnes , citing exit poll data . 
  the new parliament will also include the united patriots -- 8.8 % , dps -- 7.7 % , volya -- 4.6 % . 
  the reformist bloc is on the verge -- 3.8 % . 
  they are not coming to vienna again !, 
  it ist of forbidden !, 
  which dam is that exactly ?
