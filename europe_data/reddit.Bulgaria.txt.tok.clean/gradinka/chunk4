  funny thing is , i can mostly understand this guy ( the 2 speeches ), 
  interesting question is : to where ? 
  most interesting !, 
  so what * do * you drink then - g\u00f6sser ? 
  in a way , that 's more of an ` eastern ' leader , 
  true , 
  ai n't no plane remained in the sky  they all land , one way or the other, 
  but ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyrjoc5ttxa, 
  my parents live on that street , somewhere in the back of the photo, 
  yeah , but there seem to be a lot more - that camp in bulgaria is like for ~ 1000 persons , now they 're up to 4000 there ; - there is n't a doctor stationed on-site , only visitations like 1 per week ; and its just 1-2 doctors . 
  for the refugees it 's hard to get access to medical treatment for anything that 's not life-threatening ( then ambulance comes ) so skin diseases , malaria , or others are left untreated . 
  - it was sad on the news there 's an outbreak of `` exotic '' diseases , which the right-wing blew out of proportions and scared the local population . 
  they of course , started protesting . 
  - government impose that ` quarantine ' , but even officially they admit ( health minister ) that it 's more to suit the protests and calm the local people , than to actually prevent spreading of disease . 
  so nobody is allowed out of the camp now . 
  - another thing is , there 're more afghans and pakistanis in the camp , then syrians . 
  and they seem to be aggressive and easily startled ( like sandpeople . ), 
  - all it needed was one person to start a riot and there you have it . 
  so now pm said they 'll repurpose old army barracks and move the more aggressive folks there . 
  we 'll see how it goes . 
  already 20 + people have been arrested and identified as the instigators . 
  funny how one can get away with such a comment on reddit or 9gag , but be torn apart on every other place . 
  kinda similar in bulgaria , at least in the cities there 'll be those folks picking up every carton or piece of metal from the rubbish bin and giving it to the recyclers for some $ $, 
  oh , you do n't say ? 
  triggered, 
  that is not quite so ( abt atanasoff ) . 
  we can say he contributed a lot to the advancement of computers though . 
  and he is only of bg origin , never really identified himself as bulgarian . 
  ( i 've read much about him , and computers history in general . 
  and one can see replica of his computer in the computer history museum in menlo park , ca ), 
  thought so - a book by a * \u010detnik * and sites in serbian . 
  the exact opposite stuff exist on our side of the internet as well  * ^ ( google '' \u0441\u0440\u044a\u0431\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 '' or '' \u0441\u0440\u044a\u0431\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 '' if interested ) * thanks , but no thanks - let 's stop here . 
  the one thing i love most is the nature . 
  its the only thing that have kept me of moving abroad all these years . 
  there 's mountains and lakes and rivers and plains and seaside , all within couple of hours drive !, 
  notorious ? 
  war crimes ? 
  bayoneting children ? 
  maybe even eating them alive ? 
  any credible sources to share ? 
  ( i mean , not underground pro-serbian sites ) can we * at least * once try to refrain from this local crap , please . 
  thanks !, 
  join it , 
  to some extend maybe , but in general you are wrong . 
  lots of you lot here . 
  and most of it started with just [ `` a line in the sand '' ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12121296-a-line-in-the-sand ), 
  winter months at the ski resort of bansko , 1/3 of the cars are with ` bg ' license plates  so not sure abt that ... 
  in the summer it 's less so though , i agree . 
  agree , but that 's why the up/down buttons are . 
  we can have a rule - there has to be a post about may , merkel or macron once in every 20 posts then . 
  so that it can be serious enough . 
  but hey , are n't they presidents of europe ? 
  ^ yeah , yeah ^ i know technically only macron is a _ president _ but that 's not my point, 
  totally agree . 
  that is kinda ridiculous . 
  it 's totally subjective thing , whether one wants posts about merkel or brexit or nice places / / fun facts across eu . 
  life is not only about immigration and problems and ` stuff that matters ' . 
  i do n't understand what is `` low quality '' - is it the video resolution ? 
  unfortunately , it is only 480p , no hd version of this exists * at all * . 
  that 's what have been published by ministry of defense/air force back then . 
  thanks, 
  video of bulgaria 's current president , rumen radev shoot in 2014 at an aviation show in sofia , bulgaria . 
  ^ ( music is a bit over-dramatic ) trivia : at the end , he 's congratulated by the _ then president _ , rosen plevneliev, 
  its good very similar to bulgarian orthodox chants also, 
  somehow you see it all black/white . 
  the rules this , the rules that ; unfortunately , as we see every day , rules are bent very easily . 
  and usually , from the very ` strict ' . 
  politics does n't work much by the rules , it is a game of shadoe whether we like it or not :(, 
  there 's a lot of truth in that one line . 
  let 's also clarify that this was a poll within the average people . 
  i am not following such polls in germany , but i am doubtful results will come up much different . 
  remember - the average people , not the government or politicians . 
  but you know , that may be a political solution . 
  poles can say `` ok !, 
  fine , we are letting everybody in '' and then watch how nobody comes . 
  it depends a lot on what `` his part '' is , and who/how decides that . 
  as the article says , poles would prefer _ leaving the eu _ over taking the influx . 
  so it 's all honest . 
  kinda similar to the uk thingie , the brexit one . 
  but , it is part of the eu, 
  adana kebap is good though, 
  funny are , think you ? 
  we have all watched the adventures of hajaska back then https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuaj1q5czt0, 
  like , nowhere ? 
  if you live around here , you will know that nobody uses the fyrom name . 
  the only reason for this name seems to be to cause this pointless trolling . 
  i 'll stop here though . 
  enjoy the summer , 
  no need to go there , m8, 
  i kinda understand , some 30 % maybe so not a total loss , 
  ist time i hear that band and now i 'm hooked . 
  thank you guys , 
  sometimes they land on land  - mostly because getting it back to land will require too much fuel - also it 's kinda safer above water , in case something goes wrong, 
  we 've had couple of astronauts ( cosmonauts here ) at 80s era ; also built a satellite locally ( 100 % made in bulgaria ) - [ \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0441 22 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgaria_1300 ) , as well as supplying multiple measurement instruments for the russian space program back then . 
  so yes , bulgaria can into space , 
  bg : [ maritsa radneva ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/83/bulgarian_identity_card.png ), 
  well . 
  for 1300 + years of history , it was mostly bigger . 
  one can come up with any reason about that ... then the ottomans came . 
  it was larger .
