the question was :  which country do people in your country ** consider ** most similar to their own ? 
  so i went with that comic , because in order to * consider * something , one has to weight the pros and cons and arrive at a conclusion with a positive or negative view of the issue before undertaking the next step of making a comparison with the other , say , parties . 
  haha  i do agree that we have similarities with romanians , but i 'd go with serbia , because * slavic brothers !! 1 !, 
  * do n't take me too seriously on this , please !, 
  and happy cake day !, 
  in all seriousness though , it would probably be a toss between serbia and ( fyro ) macedonia or really `` none '' in the sense of * the nature in bulgaria is unique to this world !! 1 !, 
  totally right !, 
   if only the infrastructure was there though . . :(, 
   and what can bulgaria realistically do to help in the fight agains isis ? 
  [ bulgaria is one of the suppliers of military equipment to non-is forces ] ( http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/war/conflict-zones/141020/map-military-intervention-against-is ) , in case you did n't know .

  so [ my hopes just might become true ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2isnnz/bulgaria_rejects_russias_charge_of_disloyalty_for/cl567cr ) , if our parliament [ approves the new cabinet tomorrow ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/164586/bulgarian+mps+to+vote+on+new+government+friday ) .

  sorry to go off-topic , but what is odd is that i dreamed that i type exactly those words about 2 years ago , when i did n't even know what reddit is . 
  i now remember asking myself the next day where and when could that happen ( graphics and all ) or if it was just a creation of my mind . 
  well , a deja-vu right here . 
  i 'm puzzled . 
  just to be clear , i also agree with what / u/twatfacer said . 
  \\ ------------------------------------------------------- aaaaand i 'm havng a deja-vu moment just as i typed that ^ awesome . 
  yeah , the more i 'm reading into what 's happened , the more convinced i become in thinking she succeeded in her suicide attempt . . 
  the most recent news that i can find are from 3 hours ago . 
  she might as well be dead by now . . 
  honestly , everybody should have a chance at remedying/recovering after they fail to do something . 
  that is where my hope came from . 
  * however * , i am really , really , * really * doubtful the doctors will be able to help her . 
  now i could only hope they can at least ease the pain before her spirit leaves her body . . 
  damn baltic sea !, 
  always hungry for kaliningrad , are n't you ?!, 
  in all seriousness though , i call bs on this map . 
  it 's so evident they chose to put the first largest minority 's language on some of those countries . 
  it 's as if they thought people wo n't notice that . 
  according to [ this article ( in bulgarian ) ] ( http://novanews.bg/news/view/2014/11/03/91382/%d0%bc%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b0-%d0%b6%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d1%81%d0%b5-%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%bf%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b4-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%b7%d0%b8%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd%d1%82%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be%d1%82%d0%be/ ) it happened around 3 pm .

  thank you !, 
   7 people beat up a bulgarian man who is now in critical condition in the hospital . 
  may i have a link to this story , please ? 
  i do n't think this was mentioned in any of the news here , which i find odd as some of our media like to bring up such dark news from the western world into the spotlight . 
  i can not tell you if it 's many , but here the thing is that central heating became a part of the buildings built , if i 'm not mistaken , after/around 1970s . 
  the [ commie blocks ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/5883562.jpg ) built before that did n't have it and people were using [ these ] ( http://karapetrov.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/pechka.jpg ) ( called '' \u043f\u0435\u0447\u043a\u0430 '' / pechka , transl .

  a personal note that i would like to add is , just yesterday i spoke with my older sister regarding her ways of heating her place , and what she told me when i asked why she got rid of the heater in her room , replacing it with a blower , was `` i 'd rather pay 20 levs ( ~ 10 eur ) more on my electricity bill than pay for firewood and charcoal that i might not use entirely through the winter . '', 
  and also that it saves her time . 
  i hope someone else could give a more credible answer nonetheless , as i have resorted to my own observations in this reply .
