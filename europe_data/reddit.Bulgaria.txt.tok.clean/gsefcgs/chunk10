  i 'm also not sure how those 260km/person were calculated , so i 'm also taking those stats with a grain of salt . 
  here 's the latest i could find regarding the technical issues with the ro-bg pipeline :  a gas interconnector with romania being built since 2012 will not be operational before september , sources close to the construction say . 
  the 25-kilometer-long connection between bulgaria 's city of rousse and romanian gyurgevo was initially scheduled to be ready in end-2013 at the latest , but the deadline was extended over technical difficulties . 
  sources close to bulgartransgaz , the system operator in charge of the interconnector , told website econ.bg that a broken pipe going under the danube river was the reason for the latest delay . 
  attempts are now under way to pull the pipe out of the waters , with experts called on site to provide assistance , the informants have assured . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/162151/bulgaria-romania+gas+link+suffers+further+delay ) as for quantity , on bulgartransgaz 's website it is said :  * the total length of the gas pipeline is 25 km , of which 15 km on bulgarian territory , 7,5 km on romanian and 2,5 km danube undercrossing . 
  the diameter of the pipe is dn 500 mm and the working pressure pn 40 bar . 
  the maximum design capacity of the interconnection is 1,5 bcm/year and the minimum 0,5 bcm/year .

  wow , i was n't aware . 
  til !, 
  thank you !, 
  still no cyprus data though . . 
  i do n't even know how to respond to this . . why is that ? 
  ok , dumb question time : am i the only one unable to hover my mouse over cyprus ? 
  where 's the magic spot there ? 
  thanks !, 
  no , explanation was ok . 
  i understood it . 
  thank you !, 
   if we let the free market do its thing how can this be achieved ? 
  and what exactly is the `` thing '' ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  i ca n't really say that for our politicians over here , sorry . 
  only time will tell . 
  reforms need to be made and change has to come from within . 
  yes . 
  i had to delete the following sentence , because i was exceeding the 10 000 characters mark , from the article :  it is traditional in bulgaria for the school children to bring flowers for their teachers on the first day of school , september 15 . 
  it is done to express students ' gratitude for all the hard work the teachers do to educate them . 
  from the [ creator ] ( http://alphadesigner.com/art-store/europe-according-to-bulgaria-print/comment-page-1/#comment-2296 ) :  because bruxelles is the seat of the eu . 
   a society that deprives many of its youngest members the opportunities of participation is wasting potential and undermining itself . 
  \u2116 1 reason why people started leaving bulgaria , 1989 onward . 
  as a bulgarian i need to explain . 
  it all goes back to the critical years of the 90s , when basically people massively migrated to the most ` accepting ' rich country . 
  accepting meaning easier access i.e. 
  with a bribe here and there you could get there and start working . 
  men went to spain to work either as truck drivers or open their own businesses and take the rest of their families in a few months . 
  women went to italy to be babysitters or cleaning ladies , hence what italians think of bulgarians . 
  so today there is still large bulgarian communities in madrid ( for bg population ) and especially in the coastal cities and resorts . 
  thank you !, 
  glad to be of service !, 
  i second / r/bkkgrl 's words .
