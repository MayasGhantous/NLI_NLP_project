  now lets have a look at this q : [ * do you know what your rights are as a citizen of the eu ? 
  * ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/exploit/2014/03/ip/en/i14_268.eni/pictures/100000000000025d000001366b7d44e7.jpg ) it does n't surprise me one bit that the results for bulgaria are so contradicting . . 
  what do gay men named jorge get then ? 
  double ? 
  i see now . 
  we had some major floods one after the other in the northern parts . 
  last one was in the southeastern parts . 
  so essentially we had a rough summer with a lot of rain , but 30 + c degrees sunny weather for roughly a month throughout the whole march-september period . . and astronomical autumn is just around the corner . . ^ :(, 
  wait , i do n't get it . 
  if it has n't stopped raining since march , does n't that mean spring ( and its notable april showers ) got extended ? 
  or you mean we went from winter to autumn ? 
  could you explain , please ? 
  to understand the situation in bulgaria , wiki explains it very well :  in bulgaria , television series are dubbed , but most television channels use subtitles for action and drama movies . 
  axn uses subtitles for its series , but as of 2008 emphasizes dubbing . 
  only diema channels dub all programs . 
  movies in theaters , with the exception of films for children , use subtitles . 
  dubbing of television programs is usually done using voiceovers , but usually with at least four or five actors reading the lines , while trying to give each character a different voice by using appropriate intonations . 
  dubbing with synchronized voices is rarely used , mostly for animated films . 
  mrs. doubtfire is a rare example of a feature film dubbed this way on bnt channel 1 , though a subtitled version is currently shown on other channels . 
  ok , i now got it . 
  it 's very much like in tennis matches . 
  attendees ca n't and should not make a sound when the ball is in . 
  as for attendance , it 's moderate . 
  stadiums rarely get filled to the max like in football matches , but it never looks like there 's 5 people in the audience . 
  now beach volleyball is very much attended - matches are also held in non-coastal cities , so the specially constructed tribunes ( ? ), 
  are almost torn apart with people ( ~ 100 places on both sides ) + the space behind the teams ( ~ 50 people on both sides ) . 
  you mean spring , right ? 
  yeah , i agree we got some shitty weather on the balkans this year . 
  my grand mother said the last time she 's seen such summer weather was in 1972 ( or somewhere there ) . 
  could you elaborate on your question , please ? 
  haha you got me there !, 
  for me it 's , hands down , volleyball . 
  our main rivals are the polish and italians . 
  if/when our team ( especially women 's ) wins over any of those two , we 're bound to be in or near the top 3 ( my impression ) . 
  some info : * [ european volleyball league ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_volleyball_league ) - held between may-july . 
  * [ european volleyball championship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_volleyball_championship ) - held in september . 
  other than that i 'd say basketball . 
  info : [ european basketball championship ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiba_eurobasket ) ( now called eurobasket ) . 
  about the lesser known ones , specifically for bulgaria : [ swimming sports ] ( http://www.bgswim.info/ ) . 
  yes , you 're right . 
  now i 'm curious what they export to estonia . . 
  but ireland , lithuania and sweden also do n't store , as much as i can see , and they still are in this list . 
  for me the most odd one missing is greece . . 
  thank you !, 
  though , let 's see the top 5 products that bulgaria exported to eesti in 2013 : * el . 
  transformers , static el . 
  converters ( for example , rectifiers ) and inductive coils * other engines * structures and parts for structures ( elements for : bridges , towers , roofs , doors and windows ) * machines and apparatus for air conditioning , incl . 
  fans * paper of the kind used for making toilet paper , paper for drying the hands , for paper towels , or other similar for household purposes so in the end i do n't think / r/oex would see bulgarian often on the instructions of a product ^ ^ ^ yet . . :d, 
  this list is missing like 6 member states . 
  why is that ? 
  just curious . 
  so ich liebe \u00d6sterreich are the magic words ? 
  [ uh , oh ] ( https://forums.oneplus.net/attachments/laughing-gif.10714/ ) . . 
  so how many * decades * shall i be entertaining myself there until the day i have to throw my forged eu id & passport for a * real * eu one ? 
  [ so did i ] ( https://31.media.tumblr.com/73fda0b5a27521a2240477f38e52cd77/tumblr_inline_nay7jd2qjs1so22n4.gif ) , my sides hurt ... [ i 'm totally alright ] ( http://media.tumblr.com/20de91c940ba7bc47573d7ce42401696/tumblr_inline_nax4h9uzdy1s7ysji.gif ) though , no worries . . 
  well , now this is disappointing . 
  i myself discovered it just the other day . 
  :d now check this : whynotboth.gif, 
   ( which i could n't find ) i found it !, 
  it 's [ here ( pdf !, 
  ) ] ( http://www.gmfus.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files_mf/1408726801trends_2014_complete.pdf ) , page 32 ( p. 34 printed ) . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/163134/president+plevneliev+rules+out+bulgaria+could+send+troops+to+ukraine ) , paragraph # 6 . 
  i like how you ordered them : reds in the left , blues in the right . 
  nonetheless `` progressive alliance of socialists and democrats '' are what they 're called in the european parliament , outside of it it 's `` party of european socialists '' . 
  also , i was corrected [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2fzsju/the_new_structure_of_the_juncker_commission/ckeig9s ) that alenka bratu\u0161ek is affiliated with alde , so she 's not independent . . 
  anyway , it 's a great diagram !, 
  good job !, 
  thank you !, 
  fixed !, 
  this . 
  i hope so , too . 
  you know , when you come from a piss poor country , having a good laugh is probably the best thing to hold on to to keep on in life . 
  that 's why we are so good at doing just that . 
  ooo , like our president , not bulgarians !, 
  :d i mean following your line of thought about separation of governmental stance with people 's . . :d though our president 's ratings ( ~ 65 % ) have always been higher than any other politician . 
  some say that 's because we 're not a presidential republic . 
  haha seriously though he has always acted on his words and it would really be hard to find something he 's done to hate him for . 
  well , our president is also commander-in-chief of the bulgarian army and said last week that we have a concrete plan to support you in case of russian attack on romania , if that is a reconciliation . . 
  next one will almost for sure be pro-european , but i guess until that happens , we are still stuck with the peeking skeletons in our closet . . 
   governments oh . 
  uhmm , about those . 
  wee have issues with those right now . . 
  so data before august is a bit out of place . 
  interim is reluctant . 
  what do you have ? 
  genuinely curious . 
   bulgaria is almost pro-russia but pressed with the door by eu and nato i 've been hunting for months to find a survey or something that shows the people 's stance . 
  could you , please , share your source for that ? 
  pretty please ? 
  no cyprus ? 
  i actually did check out the [ university ] ( http://www.happytellus.com/img/rostock/rostock---brunnen-der-lebensfr_3307.jpg ) , as well as their [ department ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/university_rostock_department_of_anatomy_2_image_stitch.jpg ) when i was there . 
  indeed i saw many young people and the night life is decent for a not so big town . 
  source , please ? 
  nothing was indicated [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alliance_of_alenka_bratu%c5%a1ek ) , so that 's why i wrote independent . . 
  i think that job is more about enlargement , so the focus is basically on ( examining and support of ) the ( economic ) progress in western balkans , turkey and guam . 
  in this sense , italy 's job has more to do with nato than austria 's .
