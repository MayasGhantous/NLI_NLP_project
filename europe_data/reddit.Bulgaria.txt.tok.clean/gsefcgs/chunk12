  [ rostock ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rostock ) is a nice city to visit if you do n't like mass tourist places and wish to taste the german cuisine involving baltic sea catch at reasonable prices and good portions . 
  i recommend taking the cozy train from berlin to see the picturesque nature of northeastern germany . 
  for me it was truly a great experience as i got to see the baltic sea for the first time . 
  yes , mafia and corruption are present in bulgaria . 
  yes , people protested against corruption & several people did commit self-immolations publicly last year . 
  yes , many people do live in absolute poverty . 
  nonetheless , there are also many people who work hard to have a decent life in bulgaria ( a point , which this video is missing and failed to show ) . 
  in the end it is all part of our fights and struggles to achieve a working democracy . 
  if i missed something , feel free to ask . 
   ... ~ ~ sorry ~ ~ pardon ftfy ^ , 
  i 'm having a few issues at the starting points of this article . 
   ** in may ** several fellow eu members expressed fears that bulgaria was about to make a decisive and irrevocable tilt towards russia . 
  you mean when we had a ** ~ ~ communist ~ ~ ** socialist-led ** government ** against which ** [ thousands ] ( http://www.optimiced.com/wp-uploads/2013/07/imgp7137_20130702.jpg ) of [ people ] ( http://dariknews.bg/uploads/photos_more/201307/path_112772.jpg ) [ protested ] ( http://www.bgpatriot.com/resources/images/svoboda_ili_sssr.jpg ) ** for 1 year straight until it resigned in * july * ? 
  k.  ** of late ** , bulgaria [ ... ] has passed a law to enable russia 's gazprom to avoid long-established eu competition law for the bulgarian segment of its new pipeline . 
  you mean the law that was passed in the last days of the ** previous government before resignation in july ** ? 
  that same law that was disregarded by the interim government , which we have now and which [ froze ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/162809/south+stream+%3cb%3ebulgaria%3c/b%3e+halts+commissioning+activities ) the south stream project the minute it came to power ? 
  k. on another note :  * update : nikolay 's court hearing this morning was hopeful . 
  the judge lifted the order that placed him under house arrest . 
  however , the situation remains critical . 
  tomorrow morning he faces the vital hearing where a decision is to be made about extradition to russia . 
  * critical is an overreaction . 
  sadly ( for me ) , our most corrupt institution - the judiciary will gladly gobble on all those shiny rubles . 
  i wish them to choke . 
  apparently it does n't work on mozilla , but in chrome it does . 
  weird , but at least i found a solution . . 
  '' * the video can not be loaded , either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported . 
  * '' is there a mirror ? 
  please ? 
  on / r/bulgaria , [ these stations ] ( http://www.listenlive.eu/bulgaria.html ) are listed . 
  depending on taste one can listen any of them while driving . 
  some of those listed there are strictly regional though , meaning that you have to be in that specific city/region to be able to listen to them . 
  i personally do n't listen to radios , because i walk places and do n't drive . 
  when i travel , i 'd listen to whatever the driver chooses . 
  i do n't complain . 
  see , you use it in polish , too . 
   slavic , i tell you . 
  f * the russians !, 
  :d you do n't really need to take up ocs though . 
  an etymological dictionary would be enough . 
  well , duh . .  . < had a brain fart there . . 
  :d no , actually . 
  `` to plant '' in ocs is \u0441\u0430\u0434\u0463 ( sad / sada / sadya ) . 
  hence the name of the city novi sad ( new plant ) in serbia . 
  origin of the word is unknown or at least that 's as far as i know . . 
  i assume the black sea part is [ covered ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/163217/two+more+nato+warships+sail+into+black+sea ) . 
  also , our president said we have a written down plan to join you in the defense , but did not reveal much about it ( somewhat understandable ) . 
  so , romanians , be assured you wo n't be alone in case these 0.01 % come true . 
  i 'm happy . 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?amount=171&amp;from=gbp&amp;to=eur ) , it * is * 213 eur . 
  i 'd say contact them . 
  lmao , i did not expect this !!, 
  haha :d, 
  you ca n't fool me !, 
  mmmm , nah , i gots me box + my [ 2 x 1 leu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/js1ukpx.jpg ) , so i 'm good , thx . 
  what is a house ? 
  is piss poor . . [ i only has 6 ] ( http://auction.bg/uploaded/1/000921/921932/921932.jpg?lm=1403664580 ) ... 
   is n't macedonian some sort of other bulgarian ? 
  it was a western bulgarian [ dialect ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_dialects#mediaviewer/file:bulgarian_dialect_map-yus.png ) until separation . 
  i 've talked with a few people from there and it was the same experience as when i talked with people from northeastern bulgaria ( varna ) - no issues occurred in understanding each other . 
  [ they 're already in romania ] ( http://www.chevron.com/countries/romania/ ) . 
  you 're giving too much credit to the russian language . 
  the root for `` fuck '' in the * slavic * languages ( '' \u0457\u0431\u0435 '' i assume is the root in ukrainian ) comes from the word \u0465\u0431\u0430 / \u0454\u0431\u0430 ( ieba / eba ) in old church slavonic and it means `` to build a house '' , `` to build a family '' , `` to inject '' , as well as `` to spatter / to splash '' . 
  * and that 's not all !, 
  * :d `` ieba / eba '' derives from the sanskrit word \u092f\u092c\u0924\u094d\u0907 ( yabati ) , which means `` to coexist '' . 
  also , in thracian '' \u0388\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf '' ( ebro ) meant `` fertilizer '' and '' \u0388\u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 '' ( ebros ) meant `` river '' , i.e. 
  `` splashing ... '' ** tl ; dr ** : f * ck the russians and their attempts to conquer everything . 
  i agree it 's a desperate attempt , but would there really be a sensible impact of adding them ? 
  i guess we 'll see what the statistics will tell . 
  aside from that , i see this as a way of telling countries to introduce a ** legal regulation ** on these activities , thus making them * legal * . 
  i 'd hesitate on the drugs part . 
  i was just joking !, 
  :d i 'm glad it 's appreciated !!, 
  thank you !, 
  i spend a good 3-4 hours to try to provide the most unbiased , source-backed , important and informative news for bulgaria , because i feel many people on / r/europe are unaware of what is going on in the country , but may wish to know , despite it not being a , lets say , relevant country on the european stage . 
  plus , when i got here about 2 months ago , one person with bulgarian flair posted `` nothing . 
  '' , which enraged me , so i made it my quest to participate in the weekly news round-ups by actually providing news from and about bulgaria . 
  tl ; dr : i try to annoy people every week for 2 months now with my long posts in hopes someone will notice and tell me to f * off . 
  oh , come on !, 
  no thracian dances , sculptures , clothing even ? 
  i 'll pretend you just did not say that . 
  i wonder , is there anything you , as a turkish citizen , can call `` that 's from ( turkish/east ) thrace ! '', 
  when you see it , beside a map of the region or a city/village from there ? 
  asking culture-wise . 
  our current prime minister will be gone in a month as we have an interim government and respectively do n't have an actual working parliament , just council of ministers . 
  the elections will be held on october 5 . 
  current polls show [ this guy ] ( http://www.leadersmag.com/issues/2011.3_jul/bulgaria/leaders-boyko-borisov-prime-minister-bulgaria-web-images/leaders-boyko-borisov-prime-minister-bulgaria.jpeg ) would be the winner , were elections be held today . .
