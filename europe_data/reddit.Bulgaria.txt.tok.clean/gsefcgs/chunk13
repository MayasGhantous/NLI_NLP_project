   go in black sea [ four nato warships ` heading for black sea ' ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/163079/four+nato+warships+%27heading+for+black+sea%27 ), 
  sorry , i messed up the words there . 
  i meant for the study `` german-turkish life and values '' , not survey . 
  they gave [ this link ] ( https://d171.keyingress.de/multimedia/document/228.pdf ) in the article ( paragraph # 4 ) , which leads me to a 404 not found page . . 
  oh , no , do n't give up !, 
  please , do open our minds . 
  am i the only one who ca n't access the survey linked in the article ? 
  also :  date : august 27 , 2012 at 5:00 am op , please , explain . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.bhas.ba/index.php?option=com_publikacija&amp;view=publikacija_pregled&amp;ids=1&amp;id=2&amp;n=labour%20market ) is where i took the data for bosnia and herzegovina . . 
  my hometown !!, 
  ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/73817-jonah-hill-screaming-gif-imgur-n53s.gif ), 
  haha probably !, 
  but i meant it as knowledge is joy !, 
  i 'm not sure if i understand your question right , but if it has esa or lfs in brackets - the latter . 
  my pleasure !, 
  ah , yes , i forgot to mention that for most of the countries outside eu i used data from their national statistics office . 
  i will add the links later on when i 'm on pc . 
  i compiled all this data about employment in europe in the few hours between sleep and work . 
  i made it purely for my own enjoyment . 
  the idea came to me after i overheard a conversation between two men at a bus stop i was waiting at last week . 
  in particular it was because of this one sentence that one of them said angrily : * how can this country achieve something when only a million and a half are the bread-winners for all of its 7-million population ?!, 
  * so then i thought he 's most likely exaggerating and made it my quest to find out the truth . 
  turns out he was either wrong or just had old data . 
  til !, 
   i have to note the following : * estonia had ** the highest decrease ** in employment growth in comparison to the eg data for q4 2013 . 
  * hungary had ** the highest increase ** in employment growth in comparison to the eg data for q4 2013 . 
  i was n't sure how to project the above 2 points in the table , so i decided i 'd leave it for my comment here . 
  i believe i did my best . 
  hope it 's comprehensible and i 'm sorry if it 's not colour-blind friendly and if i made any grammar mistakes !, 
  edit : added more sources ( the ones i used to get data for most of the non-eu countries ) . 
  47 days `` do i have the money to go clubbing and couchsurfing with / u/iama _ george_amaa in estonia ? 
  where am i right now ? '', 
  apparently text should not be put in front of it . . like this : ( see 2nd reply ) edit : the bot will message you , not comment in a reply here .
