  people believe it increased , because they think those in power had/have direct access to steal from multimillion funds on top of the national ones . 
  at least , that is what i 'm reading in comments in various forums . 
   grain of salt i need to note here that the communist party that ruled bulgaria until 1989 was just renamed to the socialist party . 
  until all of them and the few other parties that , left it and formed other ( small ) leftist parties , are either in jail or leave the political scene for good , people would still believe russia is not-so-visibly-anymore dictating the country . . 
  i tried . 
  thank you for the compliment !, 
  yes , of course .

  i will leave the conclusions to you . 
  `` shock '' ) ` newspaper ' has them all !, 
  erm , this might sound rather egoistic , but / u/cnthlpbtmknwaccnt asked * me * , hence the voting on your comment . 
  thank you for sharing your views , but your lack of flair makes me feel suspicious about your comment a little and i assume the others do as well . . a few sources would be great !, 
  i 'll respond to him/her once i get home later on as i 'm currently at work ( having a break right now and on phone ) . 
  i also called it * stupid * , but apology accepted . 
  i 'm sorry , what ? 
  did you miss the part where i call it a ** nonsense ** ? 
  quoting the article here :  ' 90 % of the media in bulgaria work for russian masters ' so , seeing as the media are the ones spilling conspiracy theories all over the place , how could they even consider spilling a theory as the one you mentioned , which assumingly noone ever wrote about ? 
  thoughts ? 
  i see . 
  good . 
  thank you !, 
  please , read the article i linked . 
   document was removed from the defense ministry 's website yesterday should i assume the removal was decided on the meeting of the security council at the prime minister yesterday ? 
  or did they remove it before that ? 
  do you know ? 
  genuinely interested . 
  [ so did we for almost 2 years ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_history_of_bulgaria_during_world_war_ii#initial_neutrality_.281939.e2.80.931941.29 ) !, 
  it was then that we got southern dobrudja back . 
  however , today there is no massive bulgarian population outside the current borders of bulgaria in contrast with the situation back in wwii , so neither nato nor russia can incite us in taking their side with territorial gains for bulgaria on the table . 
  also , it is stupid to think about such things as eventually gaining territories , because seeing as ** we can barely take care of the population we have in the current territory ** , how could we even think we 'll be able to provide care for the eventual `` additions '' ?!, 
  i call nonsense on that and that is why ( but not only ) i see no better option than try to be neutral in these matters . 
  edit : ** tl ; dl : ** ** no wars or territorial gains are ** and should * not * be ** sought by bulgarians ** in my opinion . 
  this article speaks so many truths i can not deal . . what i think would be best is to advocate ** neutrality ** in these matters , alas i find no will for such from any of the politicians although it is evident from polls we , the people of bulgaria , hold such a will . 
  that 's awesome !, 
  thank you for sharing your story !, 
  oiii , i ai n't gon na be the driver !, 
  plus , i have no intention in going on a trip and getting drunk * alone * . 
  [ nope ] ( http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lntniapl1z1qzskxzo1_500.gif ) !, 
  i know this may not have much to do with the questions asked , but some day i would like to visit the [ taraclia district ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taraclia_district ) just to hear how those [ bulgarians ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bessarabian_bulgarians ) there speak and live . 
  i 'm very curious to find out if their bulgarian has got any sensible influence from the romanian ( moldavian ? ), 
  language that is predominant in the country . 
  on a much related note , i 've been told that i could take a bumpy ride to soroca town in northern moldova , through chisinau ( and a few wineries ^ lol ) , and explore the [ soroca fort ] ( http://laspalmas.md/wp-content/uploads/yootheme/widgetkit/gallery/soroca/cetatea%20soroca_4.jpg ) there . 
  that 's exactly what my mother says in relation to my great grandmother . 
  but , but that might make americans [ healthy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_yogurt#health_claims_for_bulgarian_yogurt ) and , and there will be no more `` fat america '' jokes ! 1 !, 
  the balance of the universe will be lost !! 11 !, 
  ^ please , ^ ignore ^ the ^ lack ^ of ^ citations ^ in ^ that ^ article . 
  ^ the ^ real ^ sources ^ are ^ `` grandma ^ says ... '' ^ and [ ^ nobody ^ questions ^ grandmas ' ^ knowledge ^ and ^ techniques ^ with ^ food ] ( http://cdn.themetapicture.com/media/funny-gif-grandma-food-eat.gif ) ^ . 
  ** you got yourself a deal . 
  ( \u0ca0 \u203f \u0ca0 ) at the same price as russia 's though ? 
  okay , thanks !, 
  latest data is from 2012 or am i doing something wrong ? 
  is there specific data for each region , for males and females , not for the average of the two for the regions , somewhere ? 
  i looked for the past 20 minutes and can not find anything like that . . 
  yes . 
  i noticed where the decimal was standing in the data . 
  to think it could 've been much worse . . 
  i guess we 'll see where it will be heading , but with the war next door i 'm in doubt for a positive ( short-term ) result . 
  well , it is definitely different now from then . 
  even their currency was more valuable [ 10 years ago ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencytables/?from=trl&amp;date=2004-08-25# ) than [ today ] ( http://www.xe.com/currencytables/?from=trl&amp;date=2014-08-25 ) . .
