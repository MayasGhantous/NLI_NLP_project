   however the refugees are also a visible presence in istanbul , with many seeking to make ends meet by begging . 
  can confirm . 
  i was there last monday . 
  my colleague and i had to learn all bus , tram and metro stops/stations near taxim square ( hotel was nearby ) very quickly in order to avoid crossing it again ( though not much successfully ) . 
  the minute you near it , you get at least 5 syrian kids ( aging 4-7 ) circling around you , begging or trying to sell you bottled water ( which is basically tap water ) . 
  syrian because `` syria '' was the only word i could catch from what they were saying . 
  on the other hand , we saw young mothers ( 15-20 y/o ) holding their * months * - old babies , begging while laying on a piece of carton under construction skeletons . 
  with this , i do n't mean to say that there were n't such sites before in turkey , because i have never visited it before . 
  i 'm just sharing what i witnessed while i was there . 
  is all . . 
  your username . 
  i like it . 
  ^ though ^ it 's ^ a ^ new ^ account . 
  so does in bulgarian ( \u0448\u0435\u0444 ) . 
  we have 3 dates in this regard : * 3rd of march : [ liberation day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_san_stefano ) ( liberation from ottoman rule in 1878 ) * 6th of september : [ unification day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_day_%28bulgaria%29 ) ( remembering the unification of bulgaria and eastern rumelia in 1885 ) * 22nd of september : [ independence day ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_declaration_of_independence ) ( independence from the ottoman empire in 1908 ) . 
  liberation day is celebrated with [ ceremonies ] ( http://gradvelin.com/apic/praznuvane-na-3-mart-velingrad-2013-b.jpg ) , military rituals , public church prayers and presentation of flowers nationwide , but mostly at the [ shipka memorial ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shipka_memorial ) .

  unification day is mainly celebrated at [ unification square ] ( http://plovdivbg.info/wp-content/gallery/ploshtad_saedinenie/p2.jpg ) in plovdiv ( what was once the capital of eastern rumelia ) . 
  celebrations consist of an international memorial [ marathon ] ( http://i.id24.bg/i/274393.jpg ) , solemn service by plovdiv 's bishop , music concerts and festive fireworks in the evening . 
  main celebrations of independence day are held at the [ tsarevets ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsarevets ) [ stronghold ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/tsarevets-panorama.jpg/1280px-tsarevets-panorama.jpg ) in the old bulgarian capital city veliko tarnovo . 
  it is celebrated with festive holy liturgies , military rituals , [ leaving buquets and flowers ] ( http://www.dnesbg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/1-nezavisimost-105-godoni.jpg ) at the pyramid of independence , [ festive marches ] ( http://85.14.28.175/teenproblem/teenproblem/files/articles/576x371/f92df6ca085d5c6a0906b71a003e0c0c.jpg ) , shows , concerts and [ fireworks ] ( http://turizmo.bg/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sights_2_1855760054351.jpg ) . 
  lol what ? 
  i 'm shaking my head in agreement while i read your comment , but the accusations to that person you make put me off to be honest . 
  you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar , you know . . 
  i hope you guys get him in jail this time !, 
  such `` businessmen '' should be put where they belong for their `` business '' . 
  good luck !!,

  eh , eh , and if you had a daughter , she would be \u00de\u00f3rn\u00fd ? 
  considering what iceland 's naming policies are , i think that name can not be any more legitimate and icelandic than that .

  can we have one here at least , please ? 
  it 's also good to note that it is highly unlikely that most of the ez countries would agree to have the euro associated with a 3rd country with sky high ** corruption ** ( the other 2 being greece and italy ) . 
  some info [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_union_statistics#perception_of_corruption ) and [ here ] ( http://www.transparency.org/country#bgr_dataresearch ) . 
  things really need to improve a lot in that regard prior to considering adoption of the euro . 
  [ typical bulgarian girl on the black sea coast ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sevlb5z.jpg ) . 
  i see . 
  thank you !, 
  what about the nation though ? 
  if you take out the monarchy , do the dutch people feel best represented by lions and if so , how do they ( or you ) project this ? 
  an explanation from both of you would be of help for the rest of us . 
  please ? 
  [ the grumpy cat ] ( https://pbs.twimg.com/media/bzmzmlmcyaawciq.jpg ) . 
  why ? 
  just look at that [ ** 144th place ** ( ! pdf !, 
  ) ] ( http://unsdsn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/worldhappinessreport2013_online.pdf ) out of 156 countries on the world happiness report !!, 
  look . 
  need i say more ? 
  was looking for a comment about the formal forms of address in a slavic language , because most , if not all , have their own version of the english `` you '' , the french `` vous '' etc. 
  the bulgarian version is '' \u0412\u0438\u0435 '' [ vi\u025b ] . 
  :d though , in case they have n't changed the rules again , '' \u0412\u0438\u0435 '' is always written with a capitalized first letter , formally and informally . 
  all 's good then !, 
   the old hen makes the soup good disturbing . 
  hmm , do n't you mean natural not national ? 
  you 're correct though , i totally forgot that austria does not have such sites , so i really should n't have expected it to be on the list . 
  hmm , interesting . 
  and here i thought bsp 's electorate was mainly 60 + y/o people . 
  i guess things are changing for the good . 
  what stops me from pointing him as most hated is that 1 . some claim him as ` the last true bulgarian ' 2 . my grandma literally said to me the other week `` during communism there were laws , now such do not exist . '' . 
  and all 60 + y/o people probably think the same , which makes about 20 % of the population . 
  it 's sad . 
  the question for most hated native remains and i ca n't think of anyone really . . 
  i was not aware of that . 
  then again i 'm not big at sports in any way . 
  what basketball players , or as op said ` heroes ' , do kids follow as an example ? 
  i 'll be glad to edit my initial comment . 
  thank you !, 
  was thinking of adding basketball , but i 'm like a fish out of water about it , so i decided not to bother .
