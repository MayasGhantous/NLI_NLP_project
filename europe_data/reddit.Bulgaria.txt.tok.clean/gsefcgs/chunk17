  mistakes happen , so maybe a revision would be good ? 
  interesting . 
  why is that ? 
  ( the `` we say/write ` euro ' in serbian '' part ), 
  3 questions : * source ? 
  * why did you present more than 1 unesco natural heritage site for some countries ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  * can you , please , add the name of croatia 's unesco natural heritage site , please ? 
  it 's missing .

  case closed . 
  yes !, 
  thank you !, 
  i 'd add a [ photo ] ( http://plovdivbg.info/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/sv-new_new1-1024x508.jpg ) with the municipality building included . 
  [ plovediv ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8082/8355426150_c36e8d398f_z.jpg ) represent !!, 
  honestly , all relics , artifacts , places etc. , left from ancient times , here never cease to amaze me even though i see them every day of the week , 4 times per day . 
  :d * real talk : * i must note that there is no exact date of the initial settlement of the city , because many cultures went through these lands , which makes some historians go all bonkers and declare plovdiv the oldest city of europe , thus creating tensions with the greek historians . 
  i believe we all could do without those tensions . 
  so , instead of working together to try to preserve and find out more about the history of the whole peninsula , if you will , we distance from each other . 
  takes time , i guess . 
  also , not much of plovdiv 's center ( where supposedly is the place to find new sites and objects from antiquity ) has been researched . 
  heck , it is said that if 2 soldiers did n't hid between the rocks of one of the hills of the city during wwii and thus found the roman theatre you see on the picture in the gallery , we may have never found out about its existence there . 
  excavations are taking place , but they 're rather few and sometimes the project get abandoned like [ this one here ] ( http://4coolpics.com/pics/0673/230920673711.jpg ) , which once was the eastern gate of philippopolis and looked something [ like this ] ( http://skribezium.blog.bg/photos/33146/original/1681_4%281%29.jpg ) . 
  to better understand my example , you need to see where the project [ ends ] ( http://antichen-stadion-plovdiv.bg/img/gallery/gallery_113.jpg ) . 
  that 's right -- in the foundations of a house !, 
  sad story it is . . edit : here 's a nice [ video about plovdiv ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr-2fa1acsw ) . 
  well , i thought stripes were put to symbolize different cultures living in parallel to each other and in synch . 
   however , your interpretation sounds better in my ears !, 
  it has that '' * we 've learned * '' , which needs to be a reminder for and be passed to the generations to come !, 
  if i may ask , what is the symbolism behind this version ? 
  really curious here . 
  oh , i see now . 
  thank you !, 
  well , buhti , mekitsi , paczki and , now that i checked , krofne also , all fall in the category of [ doughnuts ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_doughnut_varieties#variations_and_specialties_by_region ) . 
  i 'm not getting your question . 
  i never heard of krofne . 
  pictures , please ? 
  i 've been misinformed then , thanks !, 
  sounds achievable !, 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ think . . ^ ^ ^ :d, 
  yep . 
   i was trying to focus on words rather than phrases . 
  what 's the record ?? 
  and lublin sound like a nice place .
