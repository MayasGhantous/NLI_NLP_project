  that 's all i can think of right now . 
  additional info for mekitsi : 1 ) you can put a tea spoon of sugar over mekitsi right after you get them out of the pan to make them sweeter ( the sugar will melt from the heat ) . 
  they will look like [ this ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eevbq5nopx4/uck4waaquxi/aaaaaaaac9c/r7ccolz7xke/s640/2.jpg ) 2 ) from the very same yogurt though you can make what we call buhti / buhticki , in which you may put some jam ( strawberry jam is what i personally prefer ) . 
  pictures of buhti : [ 1 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vmzythix5uk/umo_yipjjii/aaaaaaaajia/nhifynnzbv0/s1600/dsc06996.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://media.snimka.bg/6570/019395486.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ftmbpfj4tro/ug03nummqri/aaaaaaaaaoe/mki96zacwqy/s1600/picture+080.jpg ) ( ignore the name & date tags on the 3rd photo , please ) 3 ) this is rather inappropriate , but funny . 
  in bulgarian mekitsi ( \u043c\u0435\u043a\u0438\u0446\u0438 ) rhymes perfectly with meki tsitsi ( soft titties ; \u043c\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u0446\u0438\u0446\u0438 ) , so in some jokes `` mekitsi '' is used to replace saying breasts in both bad ( `` old lady like '' ) and good ( `` jiggly '' ) light . 
  it 's our special word , unlike the anglosphere with their [ list of 262 names for breasts in english ] ( http://mycampustalk.com/262-names-for-boobs/ ) . 
  :d the norwegian bread ^ ? 
  resembles what us and romanians eat on easter ( and christmas , i think ) : [ kozunak ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cozonac ) . 
  romanians , if there is a difference , i 'll be glad to be informed !, 
   i have all the love for the pastels de nata , but portugal is far :( , and for the polish paczki :  fat thursday celebrations often involve p\u0105czki-eating contests . 
  count me in !!, 
  is there a place in ^ ^ eastern poland , where these contests are specifically held ? 
  aww , you have not visited plovdiv ( south-central region ) ? 
  not even for an hour on the way to burgas ( southeastern region ) ? 
  :( how did you get to burgas though ? 
  from varna ? 
  i see . 
  thank you !, 
  thank you !, 
   two completely different dishes what makes them different from each other there ? 
  genuinely curious . 
  they are essentially the same . 
  bulgarians call it banitsa , greeks - tiropita ( or bougatsa , which is a tad bit different ) , serbians - gibanica , and turks - b\u00f6rek . 
  can you , please give me a link to the photo you 've got for [ banitsa ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/banitsa ) ? 
  i am genuinely curious as to what exactly it is . 
  the photo you uploaded for banitsa is what looks to me to be a salty cake with curd and pork meat & fried cabbage to the side . . 
  here are several appropriate photos of banitsa : [ 1 ] ( http://mysticalemona.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/banica.jpg ) , [ 2 ] ( http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/145/1/7/banitsa_bulgarian_cheese_pie_by_camnhungth-d3h6m3m.jpg ) , [ 3 ] ( http://www.196flavors.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/r800-img_6201.jpg ) , [ 4 ] ( http://travelogue.travelvice.com/postfiles/2008-12-18_bulgarian-banitsa.jpg ) , [ 5 ] ( http://www.bgchefs.com/wp-content/uploads/banitsa.jpg ) . 
   edit : added a smile , because i ca n't be serious and all , when i speak about banitsa . 
  i was n't sure about romania so that is why i put ` to a lesser extent ' in brackets . 
  thank you for letting me know as to the reasons behind it !, 
  as far as i remember these incidents happened in yearly 2013 in protest against the monopolies ( [ evn ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evn_group ) and [ cez ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%8cez_group ) ) in the energy sector . 
  they naturally turned into political protests , of course and the government resigned . 
  for more info , check [ this page ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_bulgarian_protests_against_the_borisov_cabinet ) . 
  under the caretaker government we had after that , the state energy and water regulatory commission ( in bg : \u0414\u041a\u0415\u0412\u0420 ) forced the monopolies to lower the electricity prices with 6-7 % and thus we were left waiting for the new elections . 
  the result of those elections was not anywhere near the change bulgarians wanted to finally see in the country . 
  it unleashed even more , bigger protests that more or so lasted until about 3-4 weeks ago when that government resigned . 
  further info [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%e2%80%9314_bulgarian_protests_against_the_oresharski_cabinet ) . 
  in the end , although some rather sad atrocities happened & less and less eu money were coming to bulgaria , at least more and more people somewhat started to wake up and demand a change in the positive direction in the country . 
  so , yes , we are struggling , but we have not fully lost hope and would much like to be in the european family than be sold to russia ( which some view as good and many others as bad ) . 
  i see now . 
  thank you very much !, 
  the [ russo-turkish war ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/russo-turkish_war_%281877%e2%80%9378%29 ) is praised a lot in bulgaria and i would assume in serbia , romania ( to a lesser extent ) and montenegro as well , because russia 's win of that war played quite the role for the independence of the 4 countries from the ottoman empire . 
  heck , people and media even call our last [ dictator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/todor_zhivkov ) `` the last true bulgarian '' . 
  today , it is crucial that the eu emerges winner over russia , while the bulgarian population is predominantly [ neutral ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/162489/62+of+bulgarians+approve+of+eu+membership+%e2%80%93+survey ) regarding everything that is happening currently , else i 'd expect the russophilia to increase in bulgaria . . edit : a typo . 
  i was n't really sure and til , thank you !, 
  who sues who though ? 
  how exactly does the ` as long as someone sues ' part work ? 
  can you explain , please ? 
  i 'm genuinly curious . 
  i am not really sure , but if that proposal passed , the observing bodies would alarm the institutions , which on their part would stop funding in some areas . 
  i might be wrong , so i hope someone much more informed would chime in and provide a better answer . 
  correct . 
  i only wanted to provide more recent data , which would help in the comparison of the three countries for those curious ( like me ) . 
  i do n't think they have such a power since it is a national issue ( law ? ) . 
  in relation to / u/timeoutdb 's comment , one of the parties in the ruling coalition from the previous government , which resigned less than 3 weeks ago , submitted the exact same anti-lgbt law , that russia has , in january . 
  out of 240 mps in the national assembly : 84 voted `` against '' , 16 `` for '' , 63 `` abstained '' and the rest were not at work that day ( and any other day , if you ask me ) . 
  it was just a tongue-in-cheek comment on my end . 
   on a serious note , they are your nationals : moldovans of bulgarian descent . 
  i even checked what are the requirements for them to come back to bulgaria . 
  little did know how left-out of a bulgarian they write . 
  it seemed oddly strange and phrased at times . 
  anyways , what i think it is really odd is that for ` moldova car ' , google first shows this picture from a russian newspaper of a car crash involving a foreign car driver ( license plate ) . 
  such is life , i guess . . 
  here 's the [ democracy index data for 2013 ] ( http://www.eiu.com/handlers/whitepaperhandler.ashx?fi=democracy_index_2013_web-2.pdf&amp;mode=wp&amp;campaignid=democracy0814 ) . 
  summary : country | rank | overall score | i electoral process and pluralism | ii functioning of government | iii political participation | iv political culture | v civil liberties | regime type | | : -------- :| : -------- :| : -------- :| : -------- :| : -------- :| : -------- :| : -------- :| : -------- :| : -------- :| bulgaria | 6.83 | 53 | 9.17 | 5.71 | 6.67 | 4.38 | 8.24 | flawed democracy | romania | 6.54 | = 60 | 9.58 | 6.07 | 4.44 | 4.38 | 8.24 | flawed democracy | turkey | 5.63 | 93 | 7.92 | 6.43 | 5.00 | 5.00 | 3.82 | hybrid regime | edit : messed up a bit in the table . 
   moldova : car with bulgarian license plate  foreign license plate [ not much foreign , if you ask some of your countrymen ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bessarabia_bulgarians#modern_moldova ) , \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044e . 
  i would n't , too !, 
  even for the ` fashion ' part . 
  male models are pr * cks , imho . 
  always looking out to get some and that sometimes prevents them from doing their job well . 
  as for italians ( both men and women ) being dressed well - that is pretty much a mystery to me .
