  i am trying to understand what you 're saying , but the generalization you made is just ridiculous . 
  especially when looking at the rest of the countries , which should fall under your generalization , but do n't . 
  in your opinion , these 3 island countries managed to integrate into the `` something bigger '' ( i.e. 
  the eu ) , because they 're less wealthy than the uk ? 
  i am not buying this . 
  what is your measure of wealth to compare them ? 
   island people and rich people have a bit more problems to accept to be part of something bigger , to show an advanced social behavior . 
  ireland , malta and cyprus beg to differ . 
  okay , thank you !, 
  800 is right !, 
  yep , everyone around here is rolling in many * many * ^ ^ ^ ^ zimbabwean monies just as i 'm typing this . 
  `` i 'll fix bulgaria 's problems in 800 days '' , he said . . edited with thanks to / u/stormchaser23 .

  i could n't help it , i just had to take a screenshot when [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/8p0toz4.jpg ) happened . 
  makes me giggle inside . 
  okay , i get you now . 
  in my head , if i were to say < * insert emperor name here *  founded the village of < * insert city/village name here *  , it would mean that those cities/villages still exist , as they were founded , to this day , which for the above cities/villages is not true . 
  that is why i called them ancient . 
  am i wrong in my thinking ? 
  i do n't get what you 're saying . 
  can you , please , explain ? 
  ** bulgaria ** [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2cew3g/what_happened_in_your_country_before_current/cjf77k9 ) was my attempt from last week 's thread . 
  in the middle of the 1st century ad , all of what is today bulgarian lands became a part of the roman empire . 
  * 45 -- 48 ad : [ legio viii augusta ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legio_viii_augusta ) founded the ancient village of [ novae ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novae ) . 
  the pictures in the wiki page are great . 
  here 's a [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ow2wf_apl60#t=40 ) . 
  * 78 ad : emperor vespasian established the ancient city of [ abritus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abritus ) as a military camp .

  * 98 ad : the [ ancient roman theater ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plovdiv_roman_theatre ) was constructed and built in [ plovdiv ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plovdiv ) ( romans called the city * trimontium * ) . 
  [ picture 1 ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/8876854.jpg ) , [ picture 2 ] ( http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/882bcd22-a403-4da6-a47f-43703ae78d0e.img ) * 101 -- 106 ad : the ancient city of [ nicopolis ad istrum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicopolis_ad_istrum ) was founded . 
  [ picture 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/nikopolis_ad_istrum_overview_klearchos.jpg ) , [ picture 2 ] ( http://www.incomingbulgaria.com/images/bg/nicopolis-ad-istrum.jpg ) , [ picture 3 ] ( http://www.romansociety.org/fileadmin/images/imago/3593.jpg ) , [ picture 4 ] ( http://www.bulgariainside.eu/images/galleries/th_641x426/_w_5e1dd0d5cc8b0b42efc791bd8ffabdff.jpeg ) * 105 -- 106 ad : the ancient city of [ nicopolis ad nestum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nicopolis_ad_nestum ) was built in honor of emperor trajan 's victory over the dacians . 
  [ picture 1 ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/nicopolis_ad_nestum_iz2.jpg ) , [ picture 2 ] ( http://www.garmen.bg/new/images/stories/zabelejitelnosti/nikopolis/8.jpg ) * 106 ad : the second fortified town of [ ulpia escus ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oescus ) was built in honor of emperor trajan 's victory over the dacians . 
  [ picture ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ad1tark0olm/t_wknjdu0oi/aaaaaaaaahc/ftbammvp7ia/s1600/ulpia+eskus+-2.jpg ) , [ temple ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ac1ymt2apsu/unc2sgsdr7i/aaaaaaaaap4/-cwsejpfuso/s1600/viz_c12_new.jpg ) * 106 -- 107 ad : the city-state [ augusta traiana ] ( http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a4%d0%be%d1%80%d1%83%d0%bc_%d0%bd%d0%b0_%d0%90%d0%b2%d0%b3%d1%83%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b0_%d0%a2%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%8f%d0%bd%d0%b0 ) ( in bulgarian , sorry ) was founded . 
  it was named `` the most flamboyant city of the traians '' . 
  the forum of augusta traiana : [ picture 1 ] ( http://www.chambersz.com/image/avgusta_trayana_0703.jpg ) , [ picture 2 ] ( http://bulgariatravel.org/data/media/166_005_forum_avgusta_trayana.jpg ) * 117-138 ad : the [ roman stadium ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plovdiv_roman_stadium ) was built during emperor hadrian 's reign . 
  [ picture ] ( http://cl.jroo.me/z3/4/l/a/e/a.baa-roman-stadium-in-plovdiv.png ) , [ macket of the stadium ] ( http://cdn2.vtourist.com/4/6385189-small_macket_of_the_stadium_plovdiv.jpg?version=2 ) * in 192 ad : the roman imperial archives were destroyed by fire , so not much is known from there . 
  * in the early 3rd century ad : gothic tribes raided the [ montana ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montana,_bulgaria ) fortress . 
  [ picture 1 ] ( http://bulgariatravel.org/data/media/179_001_antichna_krepost_montana.jpg ) , [ picture 2 ] ( http://bulgariatravel.org/data/media/179_003_antichna_krepost_montana.jpg ) , [ picture 3 ] ( http://www.ranica.eu/img/933c4bee3a.jpg ) * 245 -- 300 ad , [ ulpia serdica ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/history_of_sofia#antiquity ) had become a major regional imperial capital , where emperor diocletian and subsequent emperors held court . 
  i would add that [ some claim ] ( http://www.bulgaria-embassy.org/history_of_bulgaria.htm#the%20bulgarians ) that some bulgarian tribes came down to the european continent for the first time in the 2nd century ad . 
  * that 's all , folks !, 
  you 're welcome . 
  same as how we can call greece a f. . . t , fyrom - shquiptar , demand genocide of all of turkey , demand land from serbia , and kill dolphins from the black sea & sell them on the black market . 
  in the spirit of polandball , ** all of this is untrue and is just pure black humor ** . 
  truth be told , i can not speak on behalf of all of bulgaria , but for most favorite neighbor country , it would be a tie between you guys , greece and maybe serbia . 
  the least favorite would be turkey for sure , because gypsies , refugees , [ dev\u015firme ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dev%c5%9firme ) , [ pomaks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pomaks ) and being generally considered a middle-eastern country . . 
  both . 
  georgia and armenia are situated south of the caucasus mountain range , making them west asia countries . 
  however , their cultures and history have strong ties with europe and are considered among the oldest countries in europe . 
  so , ` eurasian ' is probably the best way to describe them . 
  i personally consider them european . 
  kazakhstan on the other hand is more asian than european , because it 's culturally tied with asia and the middle east , geographically - a small part of the country is in west of the ural river , where the eastern-most point of europe is . 
  hope this helps . 
  edit : missed a word . 
  okay , i see now . 
  thank you . 
  op , there were n't any tourist attractions in andorra , bosnia and herzegovina , liechtenstein , lithuania , luxembourg , f.y.r.o.m. , malta , moldova , monaco , montenegro , and san marino , reviewed on trip advisor ? 
  like , none at all ? 
  thank you . 
  tried to find why it is different , but to no success . 
  now you got me wondering . 
  i will ask later on when i 'm there . 
  i do n't expect to get an answer though . 
  :d staff are usually rude . 
  will be heading over to t-market tomorrow . 
  ^ ^ hope ^ ^ that ^ ^ helps . . 
  well , feeling safe while waiting at least 4 hours in it to take off is totally what every passenger wants . 
  preferably in the hot hours of the day with no a/c , right ? 
  / s i personally like [ these ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/47889807.jpg ) new [ ones ] ( http://ruse-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/motrisa_desire99-450x266.jpg ) for all the comfort they offer . 
  alas , there are n't many of them . . to my knowledge . 
  yes . 
  [ it is a symbol of solidarity , support , unity and strength ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/raised_fist ) . 
  i do not know why they call them `` 2013 protests '' since they continued until the resignation of the ~ ~ communist ~ ~ socialist-led government 2 weeks ago . 
  oi , i 'm pretty sure a [ fence ] ( http://www.sofia.utre.bg/images/articles/2014/08/248309//865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a874109809c283dae51b13ff1b3fa421aa37d.jpg ) can always be ~ ~ built ~ ~ ** rented with tax payers money ** and [ colored ] ( http://pressadaily.bg/userfiles/images/5435430233%20gk_1024x680.jpg ) when there are [ protests ] ( http://m3.netinfo.bg/media/images/9169/9169111/655-402-stena.jpg ) in those boring countries . 
  [ they surely did n't count my speed in those statistics , then . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/csxswsz.jpg ) do n't think i ever felt this much stranded . 
  edit : a typo . 
  i have been to the university of aalto due to work , gone through helsinki . 
  it was for less than a day , but i still remember how nice everything was . 
  looking forward to the comments here . 
  well , maybe , just maybe , we are yet to achieve a new golden age . . of course , lets leave the ` annexing territories ' part and focus on preserving ( & possibly modernizing ) the culture and strive for a better economy . 
  thus , we just might achieve it . 
  agreed . 
  i 'm sort of glad this does not fully apply to our modern history though . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ yay , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ autonomy ? 
  generally speaking , 681 - 1018 ad during the [ first bulgarian empire ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_bulgarian_empire ) . 
  most specifically , the golden age of bulgarian culture was during [ tsar simeon i veliki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simeon_i_of_bulgaria ) ( simeon the great ) rule between 893 and 927 ad . 
  here 's a [ slideshow ] ( http://www.slideshare.net/intellectpleven/the-golden-age-of-bulgarian-culture ) i found . 
  did you omit to add the first song i linked in my [ comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2bxvim/european_music_week_1/cjaaav0 ) from last week 's thread , because its original title is entirely in cyrillic , even though i provided a transliteration , or there was n't enough space ( aesthetically speaking ) in this submission 's description to add it ? 
  just being curious here . 
   all the measures that have been taken . 
  i 'm a bit confused . 
  i think i missed something . . 
  they do n't mention imports from russia to eu . 
  they were banned first or ?? 
  do i need a second pair of glasses ? 
  can someone help me here , please ? 
  ( sorry i asked so many qs ), 
  thank you !, 
  can you , please , provide the source of this graph ?
