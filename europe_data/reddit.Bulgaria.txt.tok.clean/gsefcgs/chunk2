  hehe !, 
   here 's my question ( s ) : i 've been told there is a tradition in georgia to sing some long and slow songs while eating/having dinner . 
  it 's true , no ? 
  and if so , what is a song in georgian that you like singing/being sung from this tradition ? 
  a youtube like would be great !, 
  thank you for doing this ama !, 
  of course !, 
  here 's the full text of the article :  ukraine , russia and europe 's bloody borders  if nations were again allowed to claim bits of their neighbours , it could convulse the continent  somebody born in lviv in 1914 , who died in 1992 and never moved out of the city , would have lived in five different countries during the course of a lifetime . 
  in 1914 , lviv , then called lemberg , was part of the austro-hungarian empire ; by 1919 it was part of poland and became lwow ; in 1941 it was occupied by the germans ; after 1945 , the city was incorporated into the soviet union ; and then in 1991 it became part of newly independent ukraine . 
   most of these changes were accompanied by warfare and bloodshed . 
  so when it was suggested last week that , a few years ago , russian president vladimir putin had proposed to donald tusk , then polish prime minister , that ukraine should be partitioned once again -- with russia claiming the eastern territories , and poland lviv and other parts of western ukraine -- there was an uproar . 
   the details of the putin-tusk conversation -- and indeed whether it ever really took place -- were swiftly made murky by denials and clarifications on all sides . 
  but the furore over the idea of a partition of ukraine was still telling . 
  for it revealed the deep and justified fear in europe that national boundaries might shift once again , across the continent , with all the dangers that implies . 
   the dismemberment of ukraine has , in a sense , already begun -- with russia 's forcible , but largely bloodless , annexation of crimea this year . 
  since then thousands have died in fighting in the east of ukraine , parts of which are now controlled by russian-backed separatists . 
  even though ukraine held elections at the weekend , the occupied parts of the country were unable to vote . 
   there are influential voices within the eu now urging the ukrainians to `` accept reality '' . 
  rather than waging a draining and losing war to win back all of the east -- then having to rebuild its devastated cities -- they are advised to concentrate on making a success of the large majority of the country that they still control . 
  they can deny the legality of russian control . 
  but they should accept its reality . 
   that is the `` realist '' case for partition . 
  but there are other influential voices who think that even tacitly accepting that europe 's borders can once again be redrawn by military force would be a disastrous mistake . 
  carl bildt , who has just stepped down as sweden 's foreign minister , puts it bluntly : `` the borders of europe are more or less all drawn in blood through centuries of brutal conflict . '' allowing these borders to be redrawn , he thinks , would be an invitation `` for the blood to start flowing again '' . 
   the most obvious risk is that the russian government would redeploy the argument that it used to justify the annexation of crimea -- that these are lands that are historically and culturally russian -- and use it to justify seizing the roughly one-quarter of ukraine that the kremlin now habitually calls `` novorossiya '' . 
  that part of the country includes all of the ukrainian coastline , and losing it would in effect cripple ukraine as a nation . 
   [ a video titled * `` nato looks for focus against putin '' * ] ( http://video.ft.com/3769458123001/nato-looks-for-focus-against-putin/world )  if the dismemberment of ukraine began in earnest , others might be tempted to join in . 
  viktor orban , the prime minister of hungary , referred to in some other eu capitals as a `` mini-balkan putin '' , has made clear he regards the loss of two-thirds of hungarian land after the first world war as a tragedy . 
  parts of historic hungary now lie across the border in ukraine -- as well as in slovakia , serbia and romania . 
  if ukraine really began to fall apart , even some poles might be tempted by the idea of the return of lviv . 
   the german government , although often accused of being soft on russia , is particularly adamant in arguing that all talk of redrawing borders within europe must be banished . 
  it was only in 1970 that germany itself dropped all claims to the lands it had lost to poland and russia after the second world war . 
  some of these regions were at least as central to german culture as crimea is to russia . 
  the area that is now the russian enclave of kaliningrad , for example , was once k\u00f6nigsberg -- capital of prussia and home of the great german philosopher , immanuel kant . 
   it was kant who argued that the morality of an action can be judged by what would happen if it became `` a universal law '' . 
  or to put it another way : `` what if everybody did that ? '' that rule explains why an apparently pragmatic acceptance of russia 's annexation of parts of ukraine contains so many dangers . 
  if europe once again allowed countries to start claiming bits of their neighbours ' territory -- on historic or ethnic grounds -- the process could convulse the continent . 
   the russians argue that it is actually the west that started this dangerous process with nato 's intervention in the kosovo war of 1999 , and the subsequent recognition in 2008 of kosovo as an independent state . 
  that process remains controversial , even within the eu . 
  but kosovo , unlike crimea , was not incorporated into a neighbouring country . 
  it was a province of the former yugoslavia that sought independence . 
  within that process , the border between serbia and kosovo remained unaltered . 
  the kosovo war also took place in the context of the many years of fighting that followed the break-up of yugoslavia . 
   however , the balkan wars of the 1990s are relevant to ukraine in one sense . 
  they revealed how much blood can flow once europe 's borders begin to crumble . 
  awesome !, 
  i hope i 'll be here when you post your ama !, 
  also , you could have a look at what redditors of / r/europe [ know/think they know about georgia ] ( https://pay.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1pdmv3/series_what_do_you_know_about_georgia/ ) already and if there are some corrections that you would like to introduce , i 'm sure we 'd be glad to read them . 
  great !, 
  i have a suggestion to you actually . 
  if you do n't mind me asking , would you consider doing an ama here on / r/europe so the community could get to know georgia better ? 
  i know it 's late at night right now , so maybe tomorrow or whenever it 's ok for you to do it , if you wish . 
  thought it would n't hurt to ask . 
  or alive . 
  i can tell this was made by one artist just by looking at the standing lions of all 9 member states that have them incorporated in their coa , for basically looking the same , just in different colour . 
  although i find this a bit disturbing , this attempt at a eu-wide coat of arms looks good . 
  good job , / u/foulcoke !, 
  off-topic and sorry to ask , but are you from georgia and do you live in georgia ? 
  you are the first redditor i see with georgia as flair . . , 
   bosnia  another eu country did i miss something ? 
  a source by op would be great . . 
  i found [ this article ] ( http://flowingdata.com/2014/01/14/lexical-distance-between-european-languages/ ) , linking to [ this blog post ] ( http://elms.wordpress.com/2008/03/04/lexical-distance-among-languages-of-europe/ ) , where it states `` degree of overall vocabulary divergence '' . 
  so you are right in your guess ( after you corrected it ) , i guess . 
  * free wi-fi connection basically everywhere * signs ( or the lack thereof ) these 2 are a bit debatable though , but it 's all i can think of right now . 
  that makes sense .
