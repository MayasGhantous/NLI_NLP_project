  ** bulgaria ** * 1.6 - 1.4 million years before present : [ kozarnika ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kozarnika ) . 
  the human traces discovered there can be considered as the earliest in europe , if you view the caucus as an outside region of europe , seeing as [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dmanisi_skull ) was discovered in georgia . 
  photos of kozarnika : [ 1 ] ( http://severozapazenabg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/img_1046.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://www.bgchudesa.com/uploads/images/l_block_record_560_3e4r1d9u6e.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://static.bnr.bg/sites/radiobulgaria/lifestyle/historyandreligion/publishingimages/463/2011-02-16-045_1.jpg ) these earliest inhabitants of europe used [ oldowan ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oldowan ) pebble tool technology , as you can see from the last photo . 
  * 45,000 - 35,000 bp : [ the aurignacian culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aurignacian ) whose origins ( proto-aurignacian ) have been located in the [ bacho kiro cave ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bacho_kiro_cave ) . 
  then there is a big gap between this period and the next period , because , well , the lands here have either been abandoned or just very little is known & is probably yet to be actually discovered . 
  * 9,500 -- 7,500 bp : [ pobiti kamani ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pobiti_kamani ) . 
  the wiki page there explains everything known so far about them very well , in short with very good photos . 
  * 6,500 - 5,000 bp : [ karanovo culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karanovo_culture ) , which probably emerged from and somewhat became a parallel to the [ star\u010devo culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/starcevo_culture ) . 
  * 5,000 - 3,500 bp : [ varna culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varna_culture ) and the [ hamangia culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamangia_culture ) . 
  in the [ verna necropolis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/varna_necropolis ) was found the oldest known burial evidence ( world 's oldest gold jewelery ) of an elite male . 
  [ some ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kurgan_hypothesis ) believe that the transition to male dominance began in europe here . 
  * 3,500 -- 1,100 bp : [ ezero culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ezero_culture ) ( lake culture ) . 
  photos of the archaeological reserve & lake durankulak , which is also called the '' \u0415\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 '' ( lake town ) : [ 1 ] ( http://shabla.be/wp-content/gallery/durankulak/archeologic_lake.jpg ) [ 2 ] ( http://photos.wikimapia.org/p/00/03/53/21/22_big.jpg ) [ 3 ] ( http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/60208942.jpg ) * 1100 - 0 bp : [ thracians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thracians ) settled and created the historical region of [ thrace ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thrace ) , but later on created their own country the [ odrysian kingdom ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/odrysian_kingdom ) , which had [ all ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/odrysian.svg/1280px-odrysian.svg.png ) of the lands of modern day bulgaria . 
  as you can see many cultures settled and/or were created in this small part of the world . 
  nonetheless , there are still many gaps in the periods of time , for which next to nothing is known and/or is yet to be discovered . 
  yes . 
  allow me to introduce to you [ kristalina georgieva ] ( https://www.google.pl/#q=kristalina+georgieva ) , european commissioner for international cooperation , humanitarian aid and crisis response 2010-2014 and afaik she considers herself a conservative democrat . 
  i feel i must note though that her birth name is ** stalin ** ka georgieva , if that matters . 
  we also had such a tax until 1984 . 
  it was called '' \u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u044a\u043a '' ( literal translation : `` unmarried man tax '' ) and was paid by the unmarried men above 30 y/o and the unmarried women above 25 y/o ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ think . 
  for them the amount of the tax was 10 % from their monthly salary and for those , who were married , but did not have children , it was 5 % ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ iirc . 
  i can not speak for the other countries nor on part of the whole of bulgaria , but what usually happens around here is : those who speak any of the big 5 ( english , french , german , italian , spanish ) leave as soon as they can ( usually right after high school or saving enough money ) , or learn a third language like danish , dutch or swedish all the while they complete their bachelor 's , and once they graduate they leave . 
  thus , it is impossible to say what 's the proficiency of the population here in any of the most commonly studied languages . 
  it just does n't matter and will most likely be inaccurate because those people are just bound/expected to leave at any moment with no expectations of ever returning . 
  ** tl ; dr ** : i 'd say it 's low for bulgaria . 
  i did n't know there is such an index . 
  thank you !, 
  now , please , explain how these two are from * another * european country as the title of this thread suggested .

  its text has gone through many changes . 
  if a more up-to-date version comes up and it sounds better , i 'm all in !, 
  in the wiki page about bulgaria 's anthem in bulgarian it says that when a commission was held in 1964 for the adoption of * mila rodino * two [ academicians ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/academician ) said the melody was borrowed by jewish music ... no particular clarity has been brought on that though . 
  ** bonus : ** bulgaria used to have its own [ royal anthem ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aqu0gvud4y ) , which was called ... .

  i wonder if those 6 % were comparing it with the one in a country in africa or the middle east , or were just being optimistic . 
  i 'll never know , i guess . . 
  i see there is also a discrepancy in the ticket prices between marshrutkas and buses in varna as well , as viewed in stormchaser23 's comment . 
  now we only need someone from burgas to chime in !, 
  haha thanks for the info from the both of you !, 
  i shall keep it in mind . 
   they are more expensive than other forms of public transportation ( bus , tram , underground ) can you provide an example for me about this , please ? 
  i 've never used marshrutkas in sofia . 
  only bus 83 ( i think ? ), 
  to the airport and underground - several times . 
  just being curious here . 
  i 'm from plovdiv and here the price of 1 ticket in marshrutkas ( traveling within the city ) = 1 bus ticket ( again - within the city ) , which is 1 lev ( bgn ) [ ~ 0.50 euro ] .

  kinda sad it 's about public transportation in bulgaria , but i can live with that .
