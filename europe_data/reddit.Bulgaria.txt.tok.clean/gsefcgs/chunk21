  in my previous job i had to deal with and translate eu documents , laws and other stuff and did i hate the word `` synergy '' as well as `` crowdfunding '' . 
  `` synergy '' sounds so highly posh and awkward in bulgarian ( \u0441\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f ) that at one point i just gave up and did a template of its eli5 explanation and used that one . 
  it 's a word that you 'd only hear said by some high-end artist , explaining a work of theirs , or a hipster . 
  on the other hand , `` crowdfunding '' does not even have an equivalent in bulgarian so i had to either write its transliteration \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0443\u0434\u0444\u044a\u043d\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0433 or a short explanation of it like `` group financing '' . 
  -- another batch of questions for you , sorry  : would you prefer everyone try and talk in the standard form of the language ? 
  or that would loose the genuineness of what the speaker is saying ? 
  has that happened ( as in someone , who usually speaks in dialect , but switches to standard form at different conferences ) ? 
  thank you for doing this ama !, 
  i have a few questions for you . 
   i went through your ama on / r/iama and there you already mentioned your favourite words ( [ link to q & a ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/iama/comments/3knpb3/iama_conference_interpreter_at_the_european/cuz3cgz ) for the curious ) . 
  in that regard , do you have any words in the languages that you use at work/speak , which you hate ? 
  also , have you ever had a `` ah , that word/phrase again ! '', 
  moment throughout your work and what was the word/phrase and in what language ( s ) ? 
  feel free to share all words/phrases in all the languages that you had the moment with . 
  i work in a call centre and i hear a wide variety of dialects of the english language . 
  what are your most and least favourite dialects , if you have any ( out of those of the english language as well as the other languages that you speak ) ? 
  using [ this calculator ] ( http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/voting-calculator/ ) , the results would be : 1 . 
  ee + greece & cyprus : 17 vs. 11 , population yes 78.52 % no 21.48 % 2 . 
  ee + gr&cy + croatia & slovenia : 15 vs. 13 , pop . 
  yes 77.27 % no 22.73 % it 's very subjective and you can never predict how they 'd vote with precision . 
  what 's certain is that it would divide us further . 
  i 'll try to explain . 
  * the at-risk-of-poverty rate is the share of people with an equivalised disposable income ( after social transfers ) below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold , which is set at 60 % of the national median equivalised disposable income after social transfers ( [ stats per country here ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?lang=en&amp;dataset=ilc_li01 ) ) . 
  `` at-risk-of '' is used because the indicator does not measure wealth or poverty , but low income in comparison to other residents in a country , which does not necessarily imply a low standard of living . 
  thus , for example , a person living with low income in , say , france , is not deemed poor , but is at risk of falling into poverty if they , for example , stop receiving aid by the french government for being a student . 
  * social exclusion concerns anyone , who appears to deviate in any way from the `` perceived norm '' of a population . 
  it 's a multidimensional process of progressive social rupture , detaching groups and individuals from social relations and institutions and preventing them from full participation in the normal , normatively prescribed activities of the society in which they live ( e.g. , housing , employment , healthcare , civic engagement , democratic participation , and due process ) . 
  in most cases it applies to people with a disabilities , religious and/or ethnic minorities , members of the lgbt community , drug users , `` seniors '' , or young people .

  i live in plovdiv . 
  what can i help you with ? 
  feel free to let me know all questions that you may have . 
  i 'd be happy to respond . 
  only if you arrive/depart from terminal 2 . 
  if you land in t1 , you 'd have to walk the ( ~ 800m-1km ) distance to t2 , get a taxi to t2 , walk 300m to the bus station , where you 'll travel for like 3 minutes with the bus and then take the metro . 
  also , there are inspectors just waiting for foreigners not to cover the requirements ( which are at the till , written only in bulgarian ) for the accepted hand luggage that one can take without buying a ticket , and fine them for having too big or too much luggage for which they have not bought additional tickets . . sigh . 
  iirc , she has said that she 's not superficial and wants to be known as a good teacher , not for her looks . 
  insofar , none of the reports mention her saying anything about being creeped on by anyone . 
  tbh , i absolutely agree with her . 
  this whole thing is super objectifying and she deserves to be known for her professional life as teacher , because in this way she can become a role model for other young people , who might be afraid of being thought of as ` retards ' for wanting to become a pupil teacher . . ` tis just my 2 cents . 
  [ here 's a map for you ] ( http://thumbnails-visually.netdna-ssl.com/obesity-in-europe_5310b99865a8f.png ) . 
  it 's from 2012 , while we do n't know what year the above map is for , so beware . 
  let me refer you all to [ this post of mine from last year ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gt8v6/picture_of_the_28_years_old_teacher_that_made_the/ ) . 
  reposting the relevant info , which i translated and took from the news article from that time :  photo of a beautiful bulgarian teacher , leading her class of first-grade pupils to their room , stole the show and the thirsty eyes of users in the social networks . 
   the image was published in the popular website for funny pictures [ 9gag ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/aavdgb2 ) . 
   because of the great interest to the image , whose description reads : `` just a first grade teacher at the first day of school in bulgaria '' , the site decided to share it on their page in the social network facebook . 
   after only 8 hours the image gathered over 230,100 likes , 9822 shares and 7609 comments . 
   `` i doubt the fathers will not be missing at the parents-teacher meetings '' , some of the users commented jokingly . 
   `` welcome to bulgaria '' , proudly commented some of our countrymen on the network , while people from all corners of the world explained how they are currently booking their one-way tickets to come live here . 
   according to the comments of other users , the father in the background is not taking a picture of his child on its first day of school , rather of the beautiful teacher , because `` his pov is perfect '' . 
   a boy from kenya thinks the bulgarian woman is `` the natural version of kim kardashian '' . 
  his opinion quickly gathered followers . 
   others are happy the teacher is not teaching in high school , because nobody would listen to what she 's saying . 
   `` i want to be a bulgarian '' , one of the most popular comments by men says . 
   what about us ? 
  we can only rejoice at the fact that there are foreigners who say those words . 
  i work in one of the support teams of a company , whose main clients are from the major anglosphere countries , and about 30 % are based in the uk . 
  can confirm that when brits call , most of them expect indian tier of support service . 
  some even think that our names are made up ( i have about 4 colleagues , who are called george ; thing is george is a really * really * popular male name here ) . 
  if there was a line connecting france to french guiana while there is one connecting the falklands with the uk , they 'd most likely intersect . 
  unless , of course , the line from france almost encircles the uk to go around the uk-falklands one , that is . . [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mfxrw5t.png ) . 
  yet the pan-eu initiative for basic income gathered [ 30 006 signatures from bulgarian citizens ] ( http://basicincome2013.eu/en/statistics.htm ) . 
  of course , it should be mentioned that in large part this number was achieved because knsb ( confederation of independent syndicates in bulgaria ) [ supported the initiative ] ( http://www.knsb-bg.org/index.php/component/content/article?id=2893:2013-12-03-15-51-50 ) , which brought in about 20 000 signatures . 
  this joke is not exactly bulgarian and not entirely a joke . 
  in 2014 , italian writer and journalist [ roberto saviano ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roberto_saviano ) came to investigate the long-term relations of the bulgarian mafia with italy and gave an interview in one of our biggest tv channels , where he said and i quote :  * the situation in bulgaria is really complicated . 
  during the course of the interview i will tell you what [ misha glenny ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/misha_glenny ) has said about it . 
  misha glenny wrote a book called `` mafia '' , wherein he says `` italy is a democracy with mafia inside , bulgaria is a mafia with democracy inside . '' * eventually , this quote was changed to the one you 've heard . 
  that is the word of foreign origin ( so to say ) . 
  the bulgarian word is \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 ( na-she-stvi-e ) - from old bulgarian / or church slavonic / * \u043d\u0430\u0448\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u044c\u0465 * ( [ source ] ( http://dcl.bas.bg/lib/starobalgarski_rechnik_tom1/#page/938/mode/1up ) ) . 
  i think this refers to the number 2 , so if our language was included , it 'd most likely say `` dve '' . .

   7.5 millions  independence from the soviet union these are not true . 
  pop . 
  is 7.1 mill and independence is from the otoman empire . 
  he talks about [ the rhodopes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhodope_mountains ) but covers half of them on a map ; also forgets [ strandzha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strandzha ) . 
  he also forgot to mention that today is our [ unification day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unification_day_%28bulgaria%29 ) . 
  gee , he even shitposted on yt . . and lol @ `` speaks bulgarian '' on his profile . 
  tomorrow i 'm going on a 1-day trip to greece for a very , very short vacation time ( i 'll probably fall asleep on the beach under the umbrella with 2 layers of 50 + sun cream and my beach towel on . . ) on sunday i 'll be at work from 12p . m. 
  that 's about it mostly . 
   some governments -- poland , ** bulgaria ** , slovakia -- have expressed a strong preference for only christian refugees . 
  would 've appreciated the human rights watch backing this up with a source . 
  i googled `` bulgaria christian refugees '' and there is only [ 1 article ] ( http://scroll.in/article/752450/these-european-countries-are-willing-to-accept-some-migrants-but-only-if-theyre-christian ) that says :  bulgarian prime minister boyko borissov has said that his country has [ `` nothing against muslims '' ] ( http://www.dpa-international.com/news/international/christians-only-please-eastern-europe-hesitant-to-receive-refugees-a-45979801.html ) , but that accepting muslim refugees might tilt the country 's religious make-up , which is currently 60 % orthodox christian and 8 % muslim . 
  do note how the linked `` nothing against muslims '' forwards to an article , which does not mention bulgaria or the pm at all . 
  i then googled the [ same collection of words ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=%d0%b1%d0%be%d0%b9%d0%ba%d0%be+%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b2+%d0%b1%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%86%d0%b8+%d1%85%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%8f%d0%bd%d0%b8&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=op7ovccimygvsah_jbg4ag#q=%d0%b1%d0%be%d0%b9%d0%ba%d0%be+%d0%b1%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%81%d0%be%d0%b2+%d0%b1%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%86%d0%b8+%d1%85%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%8f%d0%bd%d0%b8&amp;tbm=nws ) but in bulgarian and nothing mentioning such a saying by our pm comes up . 
  so hrw , how has the bulgarian government expressed a * strong * preference for only christian refugees ?? 
  / rant over , you may ignore this comment . 
  this popped in my mind the other day . 
  went to google data and wondered . 
  how is it possible for thousands upon thousands be able to have like $ 4-5000 to spend on their `` trip '' seeing as the countries they come from barely enjoy any employment ( something like 25-40 % ) and gni ppp of under $ 2000 per year ? 
  something 's really fishy and the argument that `` whole villages collect money to send people '' just does n't cut it . 
  can charity money be investigated and who can do it in an unbiased way ? 
  would n't weightlifting be more `` your thing '' ? 
  what with [ wife-carrying ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wife-carrying ) being one of your national sports and all . . 
  you are correct on both accounts .
