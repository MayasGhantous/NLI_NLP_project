  edit : as for the 0 % acceptance in latvia , now that i clicked here and there it seems that 5 out of the 20 applicants to latvia most likely ( shows no data ) received humanitarian status , so it should be 25 % as the other 15 were rejected . 
  except for `` acceptation rate '' ( correct word is ` acceptance ' btw ) , which is [ for 2014 ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_asydcfsta&amp;lang=en ) as there is lack of data [ for 2015 ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_asydcfstq&amp;lang=en ) . 
  i exported the data from eurostat for both 2014 and 2015q1 and used excel to arrive at [ this result ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v0lygmq.png ) for the rate . 
  considering that [ he is part of the eu delegation to the united states ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/2309/richard_corbett_home.html ) and [ his most recent activity in the ep was on the negotiations for the ttip ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-//ep//text+cre+20150709+item-013-01+doc+xml+v0//en&amp;language=en&amp;query=interv&amp;detail=4-254-000 ) , can we prepare questions on that for his ama ? 
  replying to myself as i just want to comment on the things they wrote about bulgaria : i do n't know why they concluded a 4 out of 5 ambition , considering they focused on relations with russia , the eu and nato only . 
  there is no mention on the regional relations , which are also vital , and here i 'm talking about the creation of the [ craiova group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ) with romania and serbia ; the relations with greece - their economic struggles , which * could * spill over here , as well as in regards to their role in lessening our dependence on russian gas ; here also comes turkey and consecutively azerbaijan from which there are plans to get gas from ; last but not least macedonia - their political instability and now migration struggles . 
  these all should be taken into account when looking at and ` measuring ' ( so to say ) the foreign policy of the country . 
  for all that want some explanation as to the explanation behind the position of each/their country on the axis , it 's here : http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/?fa=showissue&amp;id=1465&amp;title=capitals%20series, 
  interesting that the director of the state agency for refugees gives data , which does not [ coincide with the one on the website of the agency ] ( http://www.aref.government.bg/index.php?cat=21 ) . 
  i have a [ snap shot for the stats from may , 2015 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eli8ia7.png ) and [ here it is from july ( in bulgarian though ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jjq46qn.png ) . 
  it seems that the % of refugees that have more than primary education graviate around 19-20 . 
   several times i saw policemen in the parks , but it did n't look like they cared about the situation either way ( as long as there were no fights or anything like that ) of all the times i have arrived in bas ( i even remember how it is in serbian - beogradska avtobuska stanica ) , there were always , always , * always * at least 2 policemen in or around that park . 
  i believe they are there in case of theft or something else happens . 
  i remember , this one time i sat on one of the `` benches '' there and two girls passed by me , they were obviously tourists as they had those enormous [ mountaineering backpacks ] ( http://img01.cp.aliimg.com/imgextra/i2/138129591/t2cf1exktcxxxxxxxx_!!138129591.gif ) . 
  one of them slipped on one of the tiles , tried to balance herself out , but fell due to the heavy backpack . 
  she fell on her side and hurt her forehead . 
  i rushed to help and asked if she 's ok , she said she was not and just at that moment 2 policemen came to help . 
  they immediately took her with their car to a hospital . 
  i then went back to my luggage , which was still there , just before two gypsies arrived to beg for money . 
  so , yeah , the policemen are there pretty much to keep an eye on whatever happens . 
  : i wish that park got some refreshment already . 
  it 's like the first thing tourists see of belgrade once they arrive at the station and the city is n't that bad really . 
   do you think you are better off in the east than you would be in the west or vice versa ? 
  me , personally ? 
  i work in the outsourcing industry , so i 'm ok as of right now . 
   do you think that your countries are backward or not with social attitudes ? 
  please , elaborate on `` social attitudes '' . 
  lgbt and other minorities ' rights are a very touchy subject , which is n't handled well by politicians , so escallations happen . 
  there is large distrust in politicians and especially to `` well-meaning '' ones . 
   what is the main issue in your country at the moment ? 
  judicial reform is hot since dec. , 2014 . 
  this month 's main topic is about the victims in road accidents , so often happening in august . 
  was just looking for this pic . . have an upvote !, 
  i agree with you there , but i meant to refer to this :  slovak president said that interests of brussels are more important than what people want it could be exagerated on \\ / u/embicek 's part , but sometimes it 's very like that on some issues or situations in some countries . 
  there are politicians , who feel they can not be touched and are negligible towards the voice of the voters , especially when they are on high rankings like president , vice-president , vice pm etc. 
  considering the information provided in the comment you replied to , it seems that even if the majority of the slovak population wanted to leave the eu , the politicians would n't listen to them . 
  this is a great source !, 
  i 'm thinking , since it also provides data per country , i could make a map of average % breakdown by sex . 
   bulgaria is milk-fed can confirm . 
  i eat a jar of yoghurt every morning . 
  question then : do heterosexuals have homosexual sex if it is anal ? 
   breeding can only happen by 2 members of the opposite sex you know that this does n't necessarily mean that they are heterosexual , right ? 
  plenty of gay and lesbian couples out there procreate with each other . 
  bisexuals also exist . 
  are you on mobile ? 
  you 're probably not seeing my flair ( which is bulgaria ) . 
  anyway , i see what you meant now , thanks !, 
  yup . 
  death rate is 6th highest in the world . 
  i feel something just flew over my head . 
  could you explain ? 
   they 're 10 million do n't you mean 7 million ? 
  hmm , seeing as they are on the same peninsula , the difference between norway and sweden is kinda of surprising . 
  not that the image is very ocd-friendly as it is . . :d there , [ i put a bit of order in it now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tykrcgc.png ) . 
  if  irish : 0,41 %  occitan : 0,41 %  bulgarian : 0,41 % and  galician : 0,33 %  turkish : 0,33 % then why is irish separate from occitan and bulgarian , and galician connected to those two ? 
  should n't it be irish-occitan-bulgarian-0 ,41 % and galician-turkish-0 ,33 % ? 
  can anyone explain what is ` meal ' in this case ? 
  salad + soup + dessert ? 
   breaking reddit is n't this one for when a user is breaking the rules under the reddiquette ? 
  yeah , i mean the other options cover some of it , but i thought this one was added as a broad option that covers the other rules of the reddiquette , which are not already covered in the default options of the report menu . 
   also all jobs were created in varna and sofia , everywhere else had a decrease in employment or it stayed the same . 
  could you share a source or a graph , please ? 
  i thought gabrovo would 've picked up something , what with all that eu funding that goes to there and seeing as they have received the most eu funds per capita out of all oblasts . 
  * the mother of the mayor fell in the sea . 
  * pretty much that 's the only sentence i can recall fully from the days i was studying french . 
  bonus levs should be given out when countries like rwanda , ghana , el salvador , uganda and mali are ahead of bulgaria . 
  ( [ as is the case here , page 531 ] ( http://www3.weforum.org/docs/wef_globalcompetitivenessreport_2014-15.pdf ) ), 
  this is what i found at my first attempt . 
  there 's probably more .

  the cities/towns will hold gatherings of the people living there and celebrate with lots of food , music and dance . 
  the people , who have those names , will give out sweets to their acquaintances , family and friends . 
  according to tradition ( which not many do these days ) , they will do family meetings , related to sacrifice for life , health , fruitful year ( for the crops ) , against mishaps and diseases . 
  traditional meals for today are fresh [ pitka ] ( http://gotvach.bg/files/lib/600x350/pitka-plitki.jpg ) , chicken porridge , boiled wheat , corn and pumpkin . 
  be sure to eat watermelon and grapes . 
  fish is allowed . 
  believers will donate to the church candles , cloth and money . 
  the instructions in bulgarian say the following : * a passanger has the right to cary 2 pieces of baggage , incl . 
  music instruments , if the sum of the three dimensions of each of them does not exceed 140cm . 
  the luggage of the passenger shall not constitute a danger to other passengers , does not interfere with the visibility of the driver of the vehicle and does not constitute a threat to the security and safety of the traffic . 
  * so a luggage that has the dimensions 75x40x20 ( height x width x thickness ) is ok . 
  the nightlife is the best in the big cities - sofia , plovdiv , burgas , varna etc. 
  the answer to your question about girls would be subjective , because each person has their own taste .
