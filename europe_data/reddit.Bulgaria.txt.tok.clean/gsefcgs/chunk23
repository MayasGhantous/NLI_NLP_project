  bars are alright , but if you could , * do * avoid the ones with chalga/pop-folk music as it 's rather bad , especially to the ears of a foreigner . 
  pretty much every resort has bars/clubs that get filled with young people during the summer . 
  there are also , of course , beach parties that are super wild sometimes . 
  well , yes , they kinda look like that . 
  here 's an [ example ] ( http://www.faktor.bg/uploads/images/nekrolog_kova4ki.jpg ) . 
  they probably took more money from you , because you were a foreigner , which still happens ( more specifically by taxi drivers ) . 
  not saying that sozopol or nessebar do n't have fascinating old towns , but the one in plovdiv is really great . 
  you can take a bus from burgas to plovdiv . 
  the trip should be around 3-4 hours . 
  aslo , since the city will be european capital of culture in 2019 , there 's a lot of events hapening each day/week/month , especially in kapana ( the cultural/artsy district next to the old town ) . 
  you can check the schedule here http://www.visitplovdiv.com/en/eventsplovdiv . 
  you can start with a [ free plovdiv tour ] as your introduction to the city . 
  if you come around 11th-12th of september , you can go on the [ night of museums and galleries ] ( http://www.night.bg/blog/?cat=60 ) , about which i talked in [ this comment ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gyke6/so_you_want_to_visit_bulgaria/cu30aiv ) . 
  you probably mean [ these ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:obituariesonthewall.jpg ) , they 're called \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433 ( from greek \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 - dead and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 - word ) or [ obituary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/obituary ) in english . 
  yes , they are still put on power poles , doors and walls . 
   acommodation for foreigners was expensive interesting . 
  how much did you have to pay back then , do you remember ? 
  if they [ had reported ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6940166/2-14082015-ap-en.pdf/660ae7cb-bb7d-4905-a78f-64034b4b659b ) them , probably yes , but until then it 's czech republic at the forefront with the numbers . 
   mama-ti-deba alternatively : maika-ti-sheiba . 
  also , if you are a special snowflake - born and raised in plovdiv , you can use * mainata-ti * . 
  translation varies by situation , but mostly it 's along the lines of `` whatever , bastard '' , `` mind your own business '' , `` fuck you '' , `` fuck your mother '' , `` bitch , bye '' and etc. 
  you can come visit my city of plovdiv on 11th-12th of september for the 11th edition of the night of museums and galleries . 
  as many as 60 000 people from the city and other places/countries walk around the museums and galleries of the city as they are open for free throughout the night ( extended in two nights since 2013 due to too many events ) . 
  the program of the night features more than 120 events like exhibitions , concerts , performances and presentations , which are held in museums , galleries , theaters , cinemas , clubs , bars , and open spaces throughout the city . 
  here 's some videos : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtj0msxaxvg&amp;list=plvcpfuhbuut9wwotjtzfxciwrt9o-acbr https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sghooizusa, 
  that 'd be unconstitional . 
  no emblems should be put on the bulgarian flag , unless it the standart of the president . 
  the flag , he placed his face on , is not official . 
  why do you think that ? 
  good for you , then !, 
  the message stays , though , for general awareness . . 
  i think they mean that by population varna has surpassed plovdiv . 
  iirc , varna city proper is 341k whereas plovdiv city proper is 335k , or something like that . 
  i could be wrong though . 
  if it 's by area/size , varna is deffinately bigger than plovdiv . 
  in that regard plovdiv is like 5th ( burgas being second and ruse being 4th ) . 
  i 'm sorry to hear about your experience . 
  and you are very right in that :  you just should n't go to sunny beach there are other , much better places in the country to spend your vacation and where young people also go . 
  sunny is not representative of the whole country . 
  it 's rather an exception . 
  as i have already wrote this in a thread in / r/bulgaria , here 's an advice for all foreigners flying to sofia :  buy ( a ) tickets for your luggage when using the metro in sofia , because there are inspectors , who just wait for foreigners not to do that and thus fine them ( 20bgn , if i 'm not mistaken , so $ 10 ) . 
  this is currently a very hot topic in the media as it was revealed that metropoliten ( the company that built , owns and manages the sofia metro ) did not bother to put such instructions in english or even a cartoon , explaining that , on the cashier desks in the metro stations . 
  so foreigners easily fall in the scam they put up . 
   can some local give some cost of things perspective ? 
  local from which part , described in the album , though ? 
  prices differ from region to region and city to city . 
  as for safety - normal alertness is recommended . 
  be aware of pickpockets in city centres and tourist resorts especially in crowded areas like buses , trains and busy streets . 
  prostitution is legal so be aware of them in ring roads . 
  carry a copy of the information pages of your passport/id at all times as proof of identity . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
   also , i want to pet that cat .

  [ eurostat has some stats on that ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshtableaction.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tin00186&amp;language=en ) , however distance is not taken in consideration , because . . well , domestic trips can not always be made at such a distance ( malta comes to mind and they should n't disregarded ) . 
  the last time i was away from home for more than 5 days for persponal purposes was in 2010 as since then i usually did 1 to 3-days long vacations . 
  for example , last year i went 4 times to greece during the weekends of august ( total money spent : 4x $ 15 tickets + 4x $ 10 food and drinks = $ 100 ) . 
  this was so hard to watch !, 
  can new zealand be invited also ? 
  we wo n't require them to change their flag .

  :p ~ ~ ** edit ** : it seems i have posted only the text of the article . 
  just found [ the actual reuters article ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/12/uk-bulgaria-village-idukkcn0qh1pu20150812?utm_source=twitter ) with the corresponding [ photo gallery ( in better sizes than yahoo ) ] ( http://uk.reuters.com/news/picture/goats-and-herbs-germans-get-back-to-basi?articleid=ukkcn0qh1pu20150812&amp;slideid=1071356878 ) on [ reuters top news ' twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/reuters/status/631547970530484224/photo/1 ) .

  hi , there !, 
  could you , please , pm me the details ? 
  i would like to send your friend sweets and maybe other stuff that she could possible like . 
  my mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer when she was pregnant with me . 
  despite the diagnose , she insisted on giving birth and then getting the procedure for the removal of her whole uterus including part of the vagina . 
  she 's a survivor , but there are women who would n't be as lucky as her and they should be made happy every day until the end . 
  that is why i would like to send something that could possibly put a smile on her face . 
  i live in an ( allegedly ) 8000 years old city so her not being able to come over and see all the things the city can offer entices me even more to send her something . 
  i look forward to your message !, 
  : you can try x-posting in / r/randomactsofcards ( postcard exchange etc. ), 
  or in / r/assistance ( though you ca n't ask for material items , cards requests are acceptable nonethless . . ), 
  love how we have a separate category , where are all on our own . 
  life is grey here alright . 
  next time they can put their starting point on where the average bulgarian 's satisfaction is , as in `` how much more satisfied than the average bulgarian would you say you are ? '' . 
  maybe then they 'd finally realise that legend brackets are split in equal parts , not with arbitrarily chosen difference between one another . 
  some swiss redditors have mentioned before that a low-tier job like cashiers ( at mcdonald 's , iirc ) are paid `` minimum wage '' of $ 4200 , so i 'd wager it is not . 
  ( minimum wage in quotation marks , because switzerland does n't actually have a set minimum wage ), 
   0.3 % alchohol in his blood at first i got confused as i 'm used to reading it anounced in permille , but then i remembered 1 \u2030 = 0.1 % . 
  anyway , good job on the round-up !, 
  according to the same source , [ yes ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ydsgsvl.jpg ) . 
   alde on the right with the blues why ? 
  they 're centrist and i would even say they 're more left-leaning than to the right . 
  and as far as my country is concerned , alde is represented by the party of the turks , which is allegedly a [ centre-left party ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/movement_for_rights_and_freedoms ) . 
  the minute i read \u201e \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442 `` i closed the page . 
  speculation is what that piece of article is . 
  i swear i could n't hate peevski ` s media more today than any other day of my life . 
  [ agri-food export data by member state ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/russian-import-ban/pdf/exports-data-by-ms_en.pdf ) ( very short , 5-page pdf ) has even more detailed data on what products ' exports rose or declined in each eu member state .

  the word \u043f\u0438\u0432\u043e also works in bulgarian .

  lol not the entire bg male population . 
  i 'm inclined to believe only 50 + aged men , who have no knowledge of how a computer works , watch those channels . 
  everybody esle has the internet for that stuff .
