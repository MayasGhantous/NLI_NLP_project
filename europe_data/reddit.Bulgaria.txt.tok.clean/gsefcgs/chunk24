  we asked first !, 
  yup , it 's channel number 518 with me here . 
  oh , and there 's etno tv right after it at 519 and then there 's na\u0219ul tv right before the xxx channels . 
  let us know when taraf ^ tv hd is bankrupted , please ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ please ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ pls, 
   postings are often in both english or french you mean both in en and fr , as in the ad is in both languages ? 
  or they 're either in en or fr ? 
  in any case , you should submit a cv in the language the job ad is written in . 
  the logic being that it was the hr manager of the company that posted the ad and they may not be fluent in the language they look for an employee for and that is why they wrote the ad in the language they master . 
  seeing as that would be the person that 'd be skimming through the sent cvs it is best that you facilitate the process . 
  the hr manager can invite/hire someone to check the fluency of the candidates at the interviews . 
  [ my best try so far ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uw0rm0c.png ) the bulgarian and greek words are the easiest . 
  also , i think the lithuanian and latvian words are interchangable/the same in the game . 
  good luck to everyone !, 
  this . 
  it does n't make sense to apply to a job ad , written in , say , german , wherein they look for someone fluent in german to work in , say , poland , with a cv in your native portuguese ( for example ) even if the company is based in portugal . 
  it 's simple logic , at least to me . 
  i fixed it now !, 
  got mixed up between republic of and republika . 
  plus , it was like 2:30 a.m. when i wrote it . . 
  i googled the producer 's name and it seems they have other such stuff like [ ( 6 slices of ) english bread , written on a flag of republi ~ ~ c ~ ~ ka srpska ] ( http://www.kudopan.co.jp/products/bread_01.html ) . 
  edit : fixed a spelling mistake , noted in the comment below . 
   13 may 2015 at least they could 've updated the article with a link to the report . 
  here it is ( pdf !,

  wishful thinking . . 
   leave it up to macedonia ~ ~ n ~ ~ 's * government * to do dumb shit ftfy . 
  the citizens of neither skopje , nor the country were asked about this . 
  it 's all a governmental decision and the citizen should n't be blamed ( entirely ) for it . 
  just checked [ one of their posts ] ( http://redd.it/3dis2i ) and you 're right . 
  in the comments s/he said s/he would assume full responsibility , but then s/he did n't post the iceland thread scheduled for this week . 
  on the other hand s/he also said that s/he does n't want the mods to be worried about this , so maybe that is why they have n't stickied it ( yet ) . 
  let 's wait and see what 's going to happen . 
  this is n't the first time a series was started and then discontinued . . 
  not a mod , but i think it is because it is too early to un-sticky the ` what happened in your country this week ' thread as the ` country week ' thread , which was posted on monday ( 20th of july ) , last/the first time replaced the ` what happened ... ' thread of the previous week ( posted on sunday , 19th of july ) . 
  so , if the iceland country thread was posted on monday it would replace the ` what happened . . ' thread from the previous week . 
  thus , here we are now that both posts are posted on the same day . 
  so , maybe they will wait until tomorrow morning to sticky this one for the whole week . 
  this is just a possible idea , though , so let 's wait for a mod to say what they have decided to do . 
  and just so this is n't entirely meta : icelanders , would you like the thread be stickied now or tomorrow morning ? 
  also , how sunny is it right now in your area ( what , with being summer and stuff ) ? 
  ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ tried ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  here you are given the freedom \u2122 to decide in what way you want to write as teachers teach both at the same time/class . 
  it is absolutely up to the pupil to decide how it wants to write as it goddamn should be . 
  noone is in a position to tell anybody that their handwriting is formal or informal .

  additional jokes , apart from those in the source : * alexander makedonski - the emperor of the first real macedonian empire . 
  it stretched from skopje 's central bazaar to `` macedonia '' square in calcutta . 
  * makedonski from `` chased and unwanted '' by ivan vazov . 
  the main outcast from br\u0103ila , a macedonian city in the north-eastern part of the balkan peninsula . 
  * nicolo ma * ke * avelli - a famous macedonian immigrant in florence . 
  creator of the scientific course for the liberation of macedonia , called `` ma * ke * vialism '' . 
  * nelson makedonela -- black macedonian , fighter against the bulgarian apartheid in the south macedonian republic . 
  * george washingtonski -- the first macedonian president of the united states . 
  founder of the macedonian city of washington , named after the street in sofia , where the macedonian home was built . 
  * isus ristoski ( jesus christoski ) -- a macedonian citizen , who accidentally created the global macedonian religion -- the skopian monotheism . 
  * makemed -- the one , who lied the foundations of the global macedonian religion in the holy macedonian city of mecca . 
  * adam and eve - as their names suggest by themselves , the first macedonians in the world . 
  their children are the pure-bred macedonian abel and the bugaro-tatar scumbag cain . 
  thus began the feud between macedonians and bugaro-tatars !, 
  * two macedonians accidentally meet each other in new york . 
  first one says `` ah , such a small world !, 
  '' , the other answers `` nope , macedonia is big ! '', 
  you 're welcome . 
  edit : formatting . 
   my understanding is that the media has a large part in keeping these beliefs in the air as well ? 
  80 % of the printed newspapres in the whole country are owned by a single person/company ( [ this guy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delyan_peevski ) ) . 
  just let than sink in . 
  there were [ protests ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%e2%80%9314_bulgarian_protests_against_the_oresharski_cabinet ) when the then pm appointed him to become the chief of the national security state agency . 
  an [ add-on for mozilla ] ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/danswithme/ ) has been created to warn people when they incidently try to open a website that is part of his media empire . 
  as for the youth , baby boomers ( a term that is non-existant in bulgarian media , not even on academic level ) are still 3 ( three ) times the young in numbers , so possibly with time and boomers ' death ( 6th highest crude death rate in the whole world as of right now ) plus the more and more growing influence from eu/western media and politicians , things just might become a lot better . . so somewhere around when 90 's kids and millenials ( this is also non-existant here ) are in their 40s . 
  i made sounds i never knew i could make when i saw it the first time . 
  it is very much / r/cringe , indeed . 
  well , they did ( i think ) , but ( unfortunately ) their mps still vote in parliament so they should still be up there . . and you 're welcome !, 
  just so this is complete , what would you say about that bdc ( \u0411\u0414\u0426 ) or whatever they call themselves today , with their '' '' '' `` fluent-in-english '' '' '' '' party leader barekov ? 
  compared to your [ -1.8 % gdp growth last year ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tec00115&amp;language=en ) , it 's not much really as you 're not gon na cover that loss . 
  if you could repeat the +2.6 % from 2013 , now that 'd be good . 
  though , if you continue with 1 % growth , serbia 's economy will most likely recover from the crisis of 2009 in 2018 . 
  because it * is * an [ isolated ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/indoeuropeantreedielli1.svg/1500px-indoeuropeantreedielli1.svg.png ) indo-european language with [ its own branch ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/albanian_language#classification ) , comprised solely by it . 
  yes . 
  it comes from the church slavonic * \u0431\u044b\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044a * , which is an old loan word from proto-slavic * byvol\u044a * that came from vulgar latin * b\u016bvalus * ( [ source in bulgarian ] ( https://bg.wiktionary.org/wiki/%d0%b1%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%be%d0%bb ) ) . 
  edit : and to add '' \u0411\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044a '' are independent investigative journalists , whose editor in chief was the leading nomination of the bulgarian greens party ( the legitimate one ) for their eventual seat in the european parliament , which they did n't win at the elections last year . 
  they also partner with wikileaks and are part of the [ occrp ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/organized_crime_and_corruption_reporting_project ) 's network . 
   it analyzes the frequency with which words on this sub occur in any comment and saves that based on the user 's flair . 
  op , can you , please , share if this is true or not : considering my flair , which barely mentions bulgaria , does that mean that none of my comments are in those tables ? 
  are users ' comments , whose flair is blank or not mentioning their country/region/province / city , included ? 
  bulgaria will be between france and slovenia with 22.90 % taxation , broken down like this : \\ - `` pensions '' fund - 5.70 % \\ - `` common diseases and maternity '' fund - 1.40 % \\ - `` unemployment '' fund - 0.40 % \\ - `` supplementary mandatory pensions '' fund - 2.20 % \\ - `` health security '' fund - 3.20 % \\ ------------------------------------------------------ monthly securities total - 12.90 % \\ ------------------------------------------------------ personal income tax - 10.00 % -- total : 22.90 % * 380 bgn ( or 194.29 eur ) = 297.88 bgn ( or 152.31 eur ) per month now since july , 2015 . 
  i 've been to finland and i 'd anschluss all their ( young ) men , if i could , but alas ... 
  i look at him and i think the only thing he ever topped was a slice of pizza with cheese . 
  so that 's not an issue really . 
   get that tan d and/or butt . . ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ) thank you for your support anyway !,
