  i have no worries . 
  i 'll meet him on grindr with his torso pics anyway . 
  sorry to disappoint , but my gaydar is beeping like crazy over here . 
  additionally , i 'd totally go on a date with him . 
   i also had to go back 3 or 4 more times to be `` re-packed '' at a cost of 12 lv each time . 
  by re-packed , do you mean to check you up and write you another prescription ? 
  if so , it should 've cost 2.90 leva each time . 
  i ca n't comment on the case of your wife as i do n't know what the dentist had to do on her teeth , but in any case i do n't think the prices should be the same as those in the uk , even if `` she lives in england now '' . 
  i imagine it 's almost the same as the [ what happens in sunny beach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7zvpg3ctok ) documentary . . 
  how much did you pay that doctor ( in bgn ) and for what exactly ? 
  also , did you receive a receipt ? 
  some doctors , especially in rural areas , like to go around the system and charge you if they see that you are a person with money ( foreigners could even be asked to pay the amount in their currency , aka if it 's 2.90 bgn , they 'd as for 2.90 gbp or 2.90 eur ) . 
   the single biggest entry route for migrants into the ~ ~ eu ~ ~ ** schengen ** is via international airports : most of those who currently reside in the ~ ~ eu ~ ~ ** schengen ** illegally , originally entered in possession of valid travel documents and a visa whose validity period they have since overstayed . 
   main migratory routes into the ~ ~ eu ~ ~ ** schengen ** / land & sea ftfy , dear frontex . 
  it has been like this here in plovdiv since the crisis started . 
  their number has been growing significantly since 2010 . 
  entire families moved in - the parents buying an apartment and opening a business , while the kids are signed in schools/unis . 
  it used to be the other way around because greece and spain were the first western countries to open their labour markets to bulgarian nationals , which was before the accession to the eu ( iirc , greece in 2001 , spain in 2002 ) . 
  labour activity and unemployment are defined and measured differently . 
  thus , if 70 % have jobs that does n't mean that the other 30 % count as unemployed . 
  those 30 % will be split between those who seek work ( actual unemployed ) and economically inactive persons ( people who have given up seeking work or do n't at all like students , for example ) . 
  yeah !, 
  and financed by the george soros foundation \u2122 . 
  http://bulgaria.usembassy.gov/ambassador.html the only information missing is about her husband charles p. ries , who is the international vice-president of the [ rand corporation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rand_corporation ) . 
  also that in 2010-2011 she was deputy chief at the illuminati 's department of peace , head of the mission for the placement of haarp machinery in the central balkans so she could press the red button in 2014 that triggered the floods in bulgaria . 
  / s she 's actually very cool and tries her best not to appear too much in media ( esp . 
  printed media , which is 90 % yellow press ) , unlike the [ previous ambassador ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/james_b._warlick,_jr . ), 
  with his pro-fracking stance that was n't well-received by society . 
  source ? 
  the article posted only mentions that * in previous incidents * the hand grenades are believed to come from former conflict zones in the balkans . 
  plovdiv here . 
  they are also expanding the network here and i have noticed that there are hiccups like those in the photo in some parts . 
  which city ? 
  is it ruse ? 
  could you rehost the images to imgur , please ? 
  marica and novinar are peevski 's media . 
  ( for the unattended - delyan peevski is a media mogul and an oligarch - owner of about 80 % of the printed media here ; he 's kind of like our own rupert murdoch ) . 
  the dutch seem to have submitted themselves to the sea as well . 
  i never heard about this so til : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/surinder_singh_route how long until the eea visa expires , though ? 
  make a survey and try in / r/samplesize . 
  that 'll have more participation as well as credibility for your work than people posting comments . 
  additionally , you can also post the link to the survey here , if you wish . 
   * [ put the coat of arms on the flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/flag_of_bulgaria_%281971-1990%29.svg/1024px-flag_of_bulgaria_%281971-1990%29.svg.png ) * eye twitch *, 
  so the posted map shows 2013 data , while the country of origin shows `` of all time '' data . 
  now that should have been noted . 
  there is no way 600k + people moved from bulgaria to turkey in 2013 alone . 
  can we have the source data for this , please ? 
  bah , you 're right !, 
  sorry austrians and australians . . 
  ~ ~ i assume you mean in the 2014 ranking ( ? ) . 
  that 's the flag of new zealand there above the dutch one . 
  also , i 'm perplexed as to why do you find it confusing . 
  can you explain , please ? ~ ~ edit : i can not read . 
  well , they seem [ to have been falling in the rankings since 2012 ] ( http://i.imgur.com/toflrsp.png ) as noted in the report . 
   i have a feeling that people who spent a high amount of time in education are n't the ones who have trouble finding a job long-term . 
  big majority of them do , but there are cases , where people are indeed left with no job for a good amount of time . 
  checking [ this stat ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;pcode=tps00066&amp;language=en ) and comparing it with [ this one ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=edat_lfso_09t3&amp;lang=en ) , leads me to believe that from 1 to maybe 10 % of those with tertiary education become long-term ( 5 + years ) unemployed after the completion of their studies . . 
  i do n't know why , but this sounds depressing to me . 
  `` oh , you wo n't find a job your * whole * life ? 
  well , government is thinking about you !, 
  there 's * these * money for you , so do n't worry that you spent xx years in education . 
  careers , social interaction and meeting new people/colleagues are bs anyway . '', 
  this could be just me being negative , though . 
  is it made this way so people do n't fall into the poverty figures , if they get fired ? 
   [ [ 2 ] ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitviewtableaction.do ) this one does n't work . 
  what 's the code of the stat ? 
  ( look on the top right corner ), 
  it really depends on the school , especially the high schools . 
  i was , too , introduced to the whole consultation on the `` dangers of unprotected sex '' in 7th grade , but in high school ( it was different than primary/middle school ) , we had that lecture the day before hiv awareness day , while on the actual day every student could go to the school 's nurse to get a test and flyers with information . 
  the results were ready in an hour . 
  additionally in 10th and 11th grade we had an elective course ( \u0438\u0437\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u0446\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 ) `` health education '' , where a discussion on the topic was also had . 
  i do n't know how it is in other schools , but mine pretty much made sure every student is educated on that to at least the minimal extent . 
  no stars ? 
  no marijuana symbols ? 
  there 's plenty of those here . 
  in the end , it 's to each their own , really . . 
   are your last 2 submissions related :3 with the exception of being related to bulgaria , no . 
   but seriously , i never expected to see terrorism on bulgarian clay in my lifetime , we 're such a backwater i just thought it would skip us . 
  so did i and see us here now commemorating a tragic event that happened just 3 years ago . . 
  well , why not ? 
  i have like 30 pairs of plugs . 
  i change them whenever i feel like i want another ones . 
  my shaving foam 's labeling has texts in hr-bih and srb-mne . 
  so does my hair-cream . 
  the latter is produced in [ padova , italy ] ( http://www.generacosmetici.it/en_contatti_fariness_cosmetici_padova.php ) , while the former in [ hungary by a company headquartered in royston , hertfordshire , uk ] ( http://freestyleltd.com/en/contact ) . 
  i could go and check other stuff that i have bought , but i 'm 95 % sure it 'll say hr-bih and srb-mne separately . 
  thanks . 
  i actually contacted my piercer and he told me he 'll try to get me a pair cheaper than $ 10 ( + shipping costs ) . 
   edit : [ actual yurop plug . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/i6bbzdk.jpg ) where can i order those from ? 
  i have 10mm plugs on both of my years and would love to have a pair . 
   the company will be assigned to the romania-based black sea rotational force , and will include marines from these five units : [ ... ] why exclude romania being mentioned in the title , then ? 
  journalists these days . . smh edit : also :  also deploying is the new iteration of special purpose marine air ground task force -- crisis response -- africa . 
  that unit , headquartered in m\u00f3ron , spain , and responsible for responding to crises in africa , will relieve the roughly 1,600 marines currently deployed with the task force . 
   that unit will be split between spain , italy and romania could 've easily said south and south-east europe . 
  ergh . . 
  we do . 
  there are swiss guards ( from the french speaking part ) on the border with turkey . 
  also we already build a fence on that same border . 
  not that that 's much , but some say it ` s something .
