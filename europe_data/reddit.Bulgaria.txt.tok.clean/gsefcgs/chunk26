  hey , now , in my defence , i 'd like to say that i spoke from memory , ** but ** you are right !, 
  adult bees do n't eat honey , it 's for the larvae !, 
  had a brainfart there . 
  lol * anyway * , i still think those 3 suspects are not being honest . 
  i looked it up and it seems to be this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/securities_offering just checking how many types of such rounds are , i wonder how they could gather such data , which leads me to the question : what is the source of the source ? 
  who/what entity gathered and released the data for each country and where can we check their numbers independently of companies that present it to advertise their own products/services ( see last paragraph of the source posted by matude ) ? 
   one greek and one bulgarian have been arrested as suspects this has n't hit the news here yet as far as i can see in the latest news about the fires . 
  so far , they have reported that at volos 1 bulgarian died and another has been hospitalised with 90 % burns . 
   until now all 3 suspects ( the 1 at patra and these 2 ) said that they are beekeepers , something really strange . 
  hmm . 
  on one hand it is strange that all 3 claim to be beekeepers . 
  on the other , there could be a connection . 
  my grandmother is a botanist and animal lover , and used to be a beekeeper , so let me explain : bee smoking is a thing . 
  basically , beekeepers smoke the bees , when they want to inspect the bees ' `` houses '' . 
  the smell of the smoke ~ ~ makes the bees think that [ their home is on fire ] ( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m49z75ivwb1rqqsrlo1_500.gif ) and they instinctively start a fire drill . 
  instead of defending the hive , they start to eat honey in order to prepare to leave and find a new home . 
  this makes the bees more cumbersome and less aggressive ( remember that once a bee stings , it dies ) . 
  when the beekeeper finishes with his inspection and stops smoking the beehives , the bees return to normal . ~ ~ hides possible alarm signals from the guards of the beehive ( which are pheromones ) and the beekeeper can thus proceed with his inspection . 
  * however * , i think those 3 are bulshitting . 
  if they are in fact beekeepers they should know that they should n't be using something that can create fire as heated smoke scares the bees away as the bees would think there is a very , very close fire so they flee . 
  they should be using a tool , [ that looks like this ] ( http://pchelar.com/files/tmp/image77.jpg ) , where in they mix cow dung , rotting wood and tree mushrooms , which they lit , but not heavily , and release the smoke when needed . 
  the `` fire '' inside the can very easily be put down as it only requires some water . 
  sorry for the wall of text . 
  let 's see what the police/authorities ' inspection will find about these 3 possible suspects ' claims . 
  edit : spoke from memory , which happens to be untrue now thanks to / u/lurian 's comment below ( the crossed out text is actually an explanation from my grandmother 's brother that i remember him saying when i was 7 ) . 
  i wish they talked more or explained [ their second map ] ( http://blog.funderbeam.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fb_maps_deals.jpg ) . 
  what are `` funding rounds '' ? 
  they literally erased it from the map to put their brand name . 
  arrogant fucktards . 
   salary : eur 4 384,38 ( ad5 ) / eur 5 612,65 ( ad7 ) ( indicative monthly starting salary for a 40-hour working week ) . 
  good luck , / u/zircon88 !, 
  can you share , please , did you base this on just ** 4 ** [ replies ] ( https://np.www.reddit.com/r/samplesize/comments/3c67qi/respost_academic_how_would_you_culturally_divide/ ) ? 
  ( it also says ` repost ' , but i can not find the original one ), 
   so today it could be understood as `` idiot , did you wash your balls ? '', 
  yes , absolutely . 
   because if so , i know what i 'm hanging on the inside of my bathroom door . 
  lol , now would n't that be a good every day reminder ?!, 
  ftfy , 
  to add to / u/szkwarek 's comment :  `` a bribe '' we have a separate word of the same origin as bak\u015fi\u015f for that - \u0440\u0443\u0448\u0432\u0435\u0442 ( ru\u015fvet ) , but it 's mainly used in casual conversations as we have `` more official '' ( read : of bulgarian origin ) word for `` a bribe '' - \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0443\u043f ( literally `` under-pay '' , or `` pay under the table '' ) . 
   he says the dumbest stuff . 
  ~ ~ but he shits , pisses and spits charisma ~ ~ i 'd end the sentence there . 
  he often tends to get really cringy , at least for me . 
   tips disrupt order and cause a deterioration of * public bath attendants ' * service . 
  citizens , do not tip !, 
  important distinction . 
   quality - a key ~ ~ factor ~ ~ problem ( or issue ) to the establishment of a mature communist society ??? 
  this i did not understand either . 
   you are premitted to shake blankets and ~ ~ laundry ~ ~ underwear over your balcony during the following times there is a spelling mistake there as it should be \u0438 ** \u0437 ** \u0442\u044a\u0440\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e not \u0438 * \u0441 * \u0442\u044a\u0440\u0441\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e , but * who cares !, 
  glory to dear leader zhivkov and the communist purposes and ideals !!, 
  in a joking/childish way , yes . 
  well , here 's hoping it does pass in parliament !, 
   earlier today , a joint committee mps has presented a bill that proposes cannabis legalization . 
  can someone , please , explain this : are parliamentary committees formed freely , as in without the whole parliament voting on their formation ? 
   the [ committee ] ( http://www.cannabislegale.org/ ) -- called `` legal cannabis '' -- is made of 218 deputies and senators -- a significant number , considering that the total numbers of members of parliament amounts to 945 . 
  erm , 23 % is significant ? 
  ok . keep us updated nonetheless . 
   darik news  `` barometer bulgaria '' agency come on , buddy , you 're better than that . 
  the source is dubious as hell . 
  this `` news '' should be taken with a ton of salt . 
  the agency does not have a website , thus their `` findings '' can not be verified independently . 
  that 's . . not what i meant . 
  what i said is that it is not as easy as one might think and then i proceeded to give an example and what usually follows . 
  however , you can conclude whatever you 'd like to as you 're entitled to do that . 
  yes , there is , but as soon as the boss finds out about it , he releases orders to punish all employees until the ` whistleblower ' is found . 
  he also contacts his ` acquaintances ' in the local police/court so the filed complaint gets cleared out of site . 
  tbh , easier said than done . 
  businesses are in the whole deal as well . 
  people , especially those in the 40 + group , would rather turn a blind eye to what their boss is doing than loose their job/get jailed for speaking up . 
  dodged it , austria !, 
  :d ^ ^ ^ ^ almost . 
  someone needs to tell rose troup buchanan to rip her degree in journalism apart ( if she even has one ) . 
  that title barely has any relevance with its text . 
  there 's literally only 1 sentence mentioning all-european countries ( france and spain ) , arguably 2 sentences about turkey , but about areas near the syrian border , which is on the asian side . 
  the rest of the article ( 2/3rds ) is about countries outside europe ( lebanon , egypt , tunisia , thailand etc. ) . 
  a better place of that text would have been in an article , wherein she put a world map . 
   or the north-eastern parts of plovdiv and in particular : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stolipinovo, 
   bride kidnappings and marriage occur among roma ? 
  where can i read about this ? 
  here 's one publication , it 's short ( 14-page , pdf ) : http://epc2006.princeton.edu/papers/60261, 
  hmm , i wonder why they did n't include [ bulgaria 's default on $ 10.7 ( + ) billion debt ( pdf , p. 3 ) ] ( http://www.cesr.ibn.bg/publications/rd_trcrisis.pdf ) in march , 1990 . 
  and somalia !, 
  woop , woop !, 
  time to party and . . and . . die ... . ^ ^ ^ :(, 
   bulgaria ( 15.1 per 1 000 residents ) had in 2014 the highest crude death rate falling like leaves . . 
  zippers and ties , duh . 
   last year , more than 150 buses packed with greek visitors arrived here every weekend . 
  now it is just two or three , bus operators said . 
  talk about overestimation . 
  sandanski 's station can barely handle 5 buses , let alone 150 buses per weekend . 
  thank you very much for your reply !, 
  it is appreciated !, 
  have you checked if there are any add-ons or other apps that may help you with the usage of a computer ? 
  ( this is probably a ` duh ' question , but ... ) can you share , please , which ones help you the most ? 
   consider that that i ca n't afford long pc sessions , read books for too long or in general stress my eyes for more than 15 minutes ( this and the prevoius posts are wirtten using a vocal recorder ) [ looking at this chart ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/snellen_chart.svg/481px-snellen_chart.svg.png ) , can you share up to which line of letters can you properly see ? 
  i glanced at your post history and it seems that [ you play the game `` world of warcraft '' ] ( https://np.www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3c5if6/hunteronly_encounter_in_tanaan_fel_rangari_anaara/csslr8f ) . 
  how can you do that if you are somewhat forced to use voice recorder to type words on a computer ? 
  ( just so you know , i do n't mean this in bad faith , i 'm really interested how you can manage to work around your situation . 
  thank you in advance for your reply ! ), 
  thank you for correcting me !, 
  i actually misremembered the numbers she gave .
