  she said $ 6k in finland , $ 2-2 .5 k in bulgaria . 
  later on she mentioned that microsoft looks after their employees , citing that for this month they gave her $ 5000 to do what she wants with them at work , whereas this amount would be $ 20k in finland . 
  she did n't specify what she 's supposed to use them for , but i guess it 's probably for licences ? 
  i do n't know the specifics of her work or even the work of software specialists , so bear with me on here , please . 
  i think the article posted already mentioned cloud computing or something like that . 
  well , she said that microsoft will focus on that thingy , if my memory serves me right . 
  she also mentioned other stuff , but i do n't remember them all as it was the first time i heard about them . 
  as for the success of microsoft in bulgaria - well , i should mention that we went on to talk about how more and more western companies are looking into opening offices all throughout the country because of the lower wages and the somewhat satisfying number of high school/uni graduates with 1 , 2 or more languages . 
  ( i cited some developments happening in my city of plovdiv , she did about sofia and so on ) . 
  with that being said , even if microsoft does pull out , other companies will come simply due to the above reasons . 
  so my new cousin was right . 
  a couple of days ago i was at my cousin 's wedding and as is expected i met my to-be-cousins ( a.k.a. 
  the ones from the other side , who now are my cousins thanks to that wedding ) . 
  one of them revealed that she works for microsoft in the sofia unit and said that the company will soon look to reduce its workforce in northern europe and will focus on expanding the one in southern europe , which wo n't be limited to capital cities only . 
  reasons being that wages in the north are considerably higher than those in the south ( shocker , i know ! ), 
  and with lower wages they can hire more talent to make up for the loss of the one they 'd let go elsewhere . 
  she gave an example that a software specialist in finland would be paid at least $ ~ ~ 20 ~ ~ 6 000 + per month , whereas in bulgaria the same specialist would be paid about $ ~ ~ 5 ~ ~ 2-2 500 . 
  other reasons mentioned was taxation as well as the fact that we have a somewhat satisfying amount of high school graduates each year with at least 2 foreign languages . 
  while this is n't good news for those in the north , it is for those in the south ( only , of course , if companies do focus on hiring people from less developed countries ) . 
  edit : i had remembered wrong numbers . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  i 'm talking about the people , who live in 2015 , not the 19th century . 
   we hate serbia 's guts . 
  you represent you and yourself only . 
  please , do n't speak on behalf of all of us , thanks . 
  thank you !, 
  no problem . 
   can you post the link to the guardian 's article , please ? 
   jean-claude juncker , president of the european council are you sure you are quoting this correctly ? 
  tusk is the president of the european council , juncker is the president of the european commission . 
  it could be the guardian 's fault , nonetheless , just asking to be sure . 
  ninja edit : oh my , it 's my cake day !, 
  :d 1 year old , baby !, 
  [ woop , woop ] ( http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/baby-dancing.gif ) !, 
  you could try and check with your state agency/commissariat/commission / committee/council for refugees of your country/region/province . 
  they should be publishing a weekly/monthly/annual bulletin or something like that with stats about the refugees ' origin/sex/age / education and etc. 
  for example the bsar ( bulgarian state agency for refugees ) [ publishes stats ] ( http://www.aref.government.bg/index.php?cat=21 ) for : * [ age ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0tvrqim.png ) * [ educational level ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eli8ia7.png ) * [ top 5 countries of origin ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ck6hog.png ) however , they do n't publish stats about age . . 
  does n't hurt to check if yours does , though . 
  ah , that explains it . 
  1996-1997 were exceptionally harsh here . 
  could you possibly extend it to 1997 ? 
  yup , there should be a poop icon instead of that question mark , just like this [ daily mail post ] ( https://np.www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3c4ovw/germany_under_pressure_to_act_after_nsa_spied_on/ ) from yesterday . 
  checking out [ this list here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_north_korea#bilateral_relations ) , out of the eu countries , bulgaria , portugal , slovenia , spain , sweden and the uk mention ` good relations ' with dprk . 
  however , we have to wait and see what 'll follow . . 
  it could be that the reform of primary education in italy with focus on teaching pupils languages is recent ? 
  that or they have failed to motivate the children to learn languages . 
  i know ours is fairly recent ( like ~ 10 years ) , 'cause i sure did n't have any language courses before 5th grade . 
  it should be noted though that there is a possibility that some syrians have managed to acquire citizenship in several member states , it 's just that their number could be lower and thus not making it to the top 3 that we are seeing in that press release . 
  it 'd be good to see some raw data . . ( bah , who am i kidding , as a stats-junky , of course i would love to see that . 
  always . 
  haha ), 
  it 's 27.6 % of gdp and is [ projected to increase ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/eu/forecasts/2015_spring/bg.html ) . 
  however , allow me to have a doubt on the data , [ because  ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/6796757/2-21042015-ap-en.pdf )  ** reservations on reported data **  ** bulgaria ** : eurostat is expressing a reservation on the quality of the data reported by bulgaria in relation to the sector classification of the deposit insurance fund and the impact on the government deficit of the fund 's repayment of the guaranteed deposits ( 3.7 bn bgn ) in the corporate commercial bank . 
  the impact of the transaction will be assessed by eurostat in cooperation with the bulgarian statistical authorities during the coming months . 
  this will most likely result in an increase of the government deficit . 
  cooking the books ? 
  gee , where have i heard that from ?!, 
  oh , and let 's not forget that we 're in [ stage 5 of * excessive macroeconomic imbalances , which require decisive policy action and specific monitoring * ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_ip-15-4504_en.htm ) . 
  but it does n't work , so that is why i asked what are the positive sides of that . 
  / u/zerfer75 replied it made them walk more than usual , which is admittedly a positive thing . 
  good decision !, 
  i walk everywhere , too !, 
  i 've always done it and have not had any need of a car , and i doubt i will have any time soon . . 
  so , ummm . . say , what exactly is positive about driving a non-repaired car with some parts missing ? 
  edit : i do n't get how this is a controversial comment seeing as u/zurfer75 said they has concertrated on what is positive about the situation of their car . 
  could you , downvoters , explain what is so controversial about my question ? 
  instead of pictures of the place , i think it 's better to say how big it is in size , a.k.a. 
  40m \u00b2 , 15m \u00b2 etc. 
  while true , this does n't dispute the fact that the article does * not * mention the italian republic at all . 
  before this gets flooded with comments by users who did n't read the article : title is ** bullshit ** !, 
  nowhere in the article does it say that the isis leader has declared war on * italy * . 
  in fact it says :  apart from china and india , two of the world 's most populous nations , ** the self-proclaimed caliph has also vowed to lead the conquest of rome ** as he called on muslims to immigrate to his new land to fight under its banner around the globe . 
  `` rush o muslims to your state . 
  it is your state ... this is my advice to you . 
  if you hold to it , you will conquer rome and own the world , if allah wills . '' ** the vatican city ** , the political center of the pope and a spiritual headquarter for catholic worldwide , is located inside rome . 
   ** isis says it will fight until rome , ** *** the vatican city *** ** to be precise ** emphasis not entirely mine . 
  yeah , i should 've clarified that i did n't mean to say that all or the majority of the data used for the map is from 2006 . 
  also , it just goes to show how there is almost zero public discussion on the topic in the countries , whose data is from 2006 , or is swept under the rug . . 
  how much time should pass before a data set becomes out-of-date ? 
  the eurobarometer guys need to roll the question again . 
  just a slight correction : not * all * parliaments , just those of the eurozone countries . 
  non - $ countries ca n't vote on something that is n't their own and/or have no control of . 
  if you have a wikibooks registration , could you , please , add in the [ czech-bulgarian list ] ( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/false_friends_of_the_slavist/czech-bulgarian ) the following : * cz . 
  * cena * ` price ' although i am kinda unsure if it fits , i think it 's good to consider adding it . 
   80 % of households live with under 300 euro per person monthly and to add to that 48 % of the country 's population is at risk of poverty ( 21 % after social transfers or 1.5 million people , who live with under $ 3.6 per day ) . 
  taken from here : http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/jobs-growth-investment/plan/index_en.htm#background, 
  government pays only $ 25 per student in public unis . 
  groups of students per speciality per year could go from 3 ( e.g. 
  linguistics ) up to 120 ( e.g. 
  informatics ) . 
  tuition fees in public unis per semester could be as low as $ 100 ( e.g. 
  economics ) and as high as $ 500 ( e.g. 
  engineers ) . 
  private unis 's tuition fees are as low as $ 300 up to $ 1400 . 
  same here . 
  i am against conscription . 
  i know about 10 ( or more ) people that signed up to become professional soldiers/marines after the last draft was called back in 2009 . 
  i am much more in favour people doing military training because they want it to , rather than because they received a letter from the government . 
  as for public opinion , i ca n't tell as there have n't been any polls on this topic ( as far as i am aware ) , but / u/kteof should be right . 
  before clicking the link i thought the letter would be condescending , `` man up '' , `` haha pussies '' type of text .
