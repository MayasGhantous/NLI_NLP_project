   `` prieten '' , which is the most common word for `` friend '' if you say `` hey there , my prieten ! '', 
  to a bulgarian , he would think that you are flirting/kidding with him , because you 'd essentially say `` hey there , my lovely ! '', 
  ^ ^ ^ although ^ ^ ^ `` priyaten '' ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ correct ^ ^ ^ word ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ means ^ ^ ^ `` lovely '' ^ ^ ^ - m. ^ ^ ^ adjective , ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ noun, 
   bulgarian immigrants are most likely doing manual labor . 
  this is true . 
  many fathers/men have been going to spain ever since the year of 2000 , when bg was delisted from schengen 's black list . 
  that 's not exactly the case in recent days though . 
  most stories i 've heard of people that went to work in spain are mostly about men going there and becoming truck drivers for import-export services with bg . 
  i mean spain is our [ export destination \u2116 11 and import destination \u2116 8 ] ( https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/bgr/ ) and currently the bg-es trade balance is negative for bg , positive for es . 
  all 's good though . 
  that 's one of the reasons of us joining the eu - to do trade . 
  the information on wiki about [ segovia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/province_of_segovia ) is kinda scarce . 
  can anyone shed some light on what would one do there ? 
  asking out of curiosity . . 
  but 6th of july , 2015 , has n't come yet . 
  is this from the future ? 
  oooh , ask the international historians about that . 
  ! 11 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_bulgarian_empire https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bulgarian_empire, 
  correct , but that did n't destroy the bulgarian empire . . 
  bah , another fuck up . . 
  supposedly [ this is how the crown should look like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnwrbem.jpg ) . 
  nope , samuil successfully resisted the byzantine conquest for as much as his entire reign . 
  it was under [ persian ii ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/presian_ii_of_bulgaria ) that bulgaria became part of the byzantine empire . 
  + australia , republic of korea and japan but you 're right . 
  he did n't say anything wrong . 
  i get that , but you know , i think it 'd be good if you give credit to the photographer at least . 
   uploaded to imgur 1 year ago ( thursday , february 27 , 2014 at 06:22:15 gmt ) really , `` op '' ? 
  i do n't know what that is , but googling images of compact housing i 'm thinking the dutch would know ( very high pop . 
  and residential density ) . 
  if you do n't get any / insufficient answers you can try in / r/thenetherlands or / r/architecture . 
  ah , so it marks the percentage of votes that were counted . 
  thanks !, 
  aah , my mistake then , thanks !, 
  i do n't get it though . 
  what is the difference between total and opened polls ? 
  ( for example 100 %  opened polls = number of polls , from which all votes cast were counted out of all the polls that were opened for the vote ? 
  correct or ? 
  ~ ~ how reliable is the data on this ? 
  it shows that there was 100 % voter turnout in bulgaria and in a number of other countries ( macedonia , albania , spain , poland , ukraine , czech republic etc. . . ) , which i find exceptionally odd . ~ ~ edit : i misread some of the numbers , see explanation below . 
  but ankara is entirely on the asian side, 
  your username indicates that you were 3 years old in 1976 . 
  now , seriously . 
  what made your parents ( i presume ) move from luxembourg to the u.s. ? 
  so , luxembourg today had a referendum on this ( +2 other questions ) and [ no one posted anything about it in the past month ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/search?q=luxembourg&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=month ) . 
  really telling how much informative / r/europe is on the smaller countries sometimes . . 
  ok , thank you !, 
  is that [ coburg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coburg ) there with the most bulgarians ?? 
  hmm , so they link to the website of the council of ministers , but then write :  the [ council of ministers ] ( http://www.government.bg/fce/index.shtml?s=001&amp;p=0023 ) ( the government ) , chaired by the prime minister , currently consists of 17 ministers . 
  then , when one clicks on ` cabinet ' in the upper left corner of the website , it reveals that we have 19 ministers ( 20 , if counting the pm in ) . 
  also :  the 264 municipalities form the basis for administrative and territorial self-government . 
  yeah , um , they 're [ 265 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarnitsa,_pazardzhik_province ) since january , 2015 . 
  the president decreed the creation of the sarnitsa municipality on 25th of july , 2014 . 
  for a fact sheet , this does n't start well . 
  i think you just contradicted yourself . 
  first you said :  it 's political . 
  the g20 does n't have the 20 largest economies either . 
  but then your argument against poland becoming part of the g20 was :  no , poland is the 23th economy of the world . 
  i do n't mean this in bad faith , just pointing out what just did . 
  sorry that i have to correct you , but the article points that they called for worse treatment :  participants say the right sector attackers called for all gays to be killed . 
  i mean . .  police reported that screwdrivers , knives and other dangerous objects were seized from those detained . 
  nonetheless , you 're right . 
  these news are to be expected , sadly . . 
  \u0425\u043e\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f ( holandiya ) is used more often than \u041d\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u044f ( niderlandiya ) , the latter being used in official communication only/mostly . 
  i 'm doing my best , but i 'm in [ my pyjamas ] ( http://www.wrestlecrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wwe-footed-pajamas.jpg ) . . 
  ~ ~ i think now that they moved them to the right it 's better . ~ ~ also , i 'm open to such new additions . 
  edit : i swear 10 minutes ago when i wrote this comment , the tags were on the right side . . oh , well . . edit2 : actually , scratch that . 
  i really like [ u/tangus suggestion ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/38kp7l/in_my_opinion_the_designcolors_of_new_topic/crvt1bu ) to put the tags to where the nsfw tag usually is put when used , just like in their example for the ` serious ' tags on / r/askreddit . 
  it 's not that we did n't notice . 
  we do see it is a work in progress , so i think most of us was waiting for someone from yous ( the mods ) to post an announcement or something like that . 
  now , on to my q : could the tags , please , be moved to the right side of the posts ? 
  after the title , as they mix with the thumbnails of posts and also make it difficult to properly read the titles of the submissions . 
  just a suggestion . 
  http://photos.vanityfair.com/2015/06/01/556cd6644ae56e586e4588d8_caitlyn-jenner-bruce-jenner-july-2015-vf.jpg this is the kardashians ' 65-years-old step - ~ ~ father ~ ~ mother now known as caitlyn jenner ( formerly bruce ) . 
  it 's , as you can see , from the cover of vanity fair magazine from 2 days ago , when jenner [ ` finally broke free ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0owdp2lmvbg ) . 
  even wiki is so freshly edited that it still shows her page as bruce at first and then forwards to caitlyn : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bruce_jenner it 's a whole editorial on vf : http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/06/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-cover-annie-leibovitz note all this as tomorrow i will likely not remember it . 
  well , that 's how they are ( and should be ) . 
  it 's newly started prides that do n't have a big schedule , because of small budget , which is kinda understandable . 
   i would prefer other methods myself . 
  just one thing : there are other methods for the achievement of raising awareness . 
  the whole event , if done right ( !, 
  ) , should last about several days , the march being held in one them . 
  during the other days there should be exhibitions , workshops , seminars , lgbt-themed film fest and other events of this type . 
  media likes to largely focus on the march , because pictures of people watching a movie or of people standing in a room , listening to a professor explaining their recent findings on lgbt topics and issues are boring , non-sensational and do n't give them '10 000 clicks and 1 000 comments ' ( as i 'd put it ) . 
  thank you for that link !, 
  i wonder if there is a way to see the raw data . 
  i 'm very interested to see exactly from where they are taking the number for job vacancies . 
  plenty of businesses here use websites like jobs.bg or jobtiger.bg , some even advertise in local newspapers , rather than in labour offices and/or the eures portal . 
  sorry for my ignorance , but these rates are a percentage of what exactly ? 
  whole economy ? 
  ( it 's the first time i 'm seeing this metric . . sorry , again . . ), 
  haha it 's your # 3 most visited wiki page !, 
   `` seznam mednarodnih klicnih kod '' or in english : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_country_calling_codes, 
   recommended subreddits  / r/inglin  / r/schland  / r/europecirclejerk i agree . 
  or what is written/what is missing/how an event is explained ... 
  there are probably other reasons , but i ca n't think of any of them right now . 
  you know that we can open those links and check the english wiki of those pages , right ? 
   what i found amusing is that you , us and slovenians have something in common and it is that we largely do n't know/whatever the case is/recognise country calling codes . 
  :d ( i must confess the table on wiki is exceptionally neat and helpful in that regard ),
