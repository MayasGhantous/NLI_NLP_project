  :d edit : formatting, 
  i was going by this , from your initial comment :  a serbian boy 's name which ** rhymes ** with serbian version of eve so that is why i explained that the rhyme of the phrase , which is part of the `` pun '' ( lets say ) , can not work in bulgarian when translated . 
  anyways , i have to admit i 'm getting a bit pedantic , and as i mentioned , the phrase itself has its own version in bulgarian , where it does n't actually rhyme . . so , umm , yeah , that 's all . . , 
  well , nicknames - probably , but as i said male names in bulgarian can not end with a '' - va '' suffix ( and thus loosing the rhyme ) , because it indicates that the person is a female , which is not what is intended for the phrase to imply . . 
  do n't you mean `` eve as male character '' ? 
  : `` god created adam & eve , not george ( gosho ) & ivan '' . 
  or whichever 2 most common bulgarian male names come to the mind of the person using that phrase . 
  in bulgarian `` eve '' is '' \u0415\u0432\u0430 '' ( `` eva '' ) and there is no male name in bulgarian that can rhyme with it with such a suffix , because '' - va '' indicates that the person is a female . 
  even the male version is '' \u0415\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d '' ( `` evelin '' ) and it is very uncommonly used . 
   cents are called ~ ~ cents ~ ~ `` tsenta '' ( '' \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430 '' ) just a small correction .
