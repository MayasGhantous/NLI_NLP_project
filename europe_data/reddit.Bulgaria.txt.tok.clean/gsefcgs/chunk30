  last time i tried posting from that site , i was informed that it went to the mod spam mail , because 59 % of my submissions were from there , thus breaking the rule for ` promoting a website ' . 
  and they are right !, 
  i mean , [ 6 out of the top20 posts from that site have been posted by me ] ( http://www.reddit.com/domain/novinite.com/new/ ) . 
  so , i was advised to diversify my news sources , which i totally welcome , 'cause i was fed up with novinite anyway and i thus abandoned them . 
  that is n't the case with your account though as you have never posted any links , just self posts . 
  i hereby thank you for letting me inform you that you need to chill the f out . 
  it 's just a joke . 
  great video !, 
  i guess we decided to take finland and latin america on vacation during ww2 ... 
  will somebody think of the dolphins ? 
   i 've not gone around and specifically asked the other mods what they all specifically think on this issue i think it would be great if you clarify who stands behind the `` we '' in this sentence then :  we did look into the allegations of trolling and account manipulation that you and others put forward , but in the end we could n't conclusively say if these allegations are fabricated or not . 
  our representative in that list called it a privilege on [ his twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/idvassilev/status/604544347246325760 ) . 
  romanians are the largest group visiting us , followed by greeks , turks and germans . 
  [ source . 
  ] ( http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/7058/arrivals-visitors-abroad-bulgaria-months-and-country-origin ) taken together they make up about 50 % of all tourists throughout the year . 
   that many people ~ ~ go ~ ~ ** went ** to luxembourg ftfy . 
  it 's for 2000-2013 and yeah , business trips are very likely to have been accounted in that figure . 
  i do n't know if anyone has noted it yet , but this is from the movie [ `` dear white people '' ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2235108/ ) . 
  she 's literally quoting the main character there . 
  same . 
  it 's the first time that this happens to me . 
  edit : [ tried to archive , it kinda works . . it 's readable at least . . ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20150528181139/http://blog.chatterplot.com/2015/05/berlin-language-study-languages-at.html ), 
  this actually made me wish i 'd have never read the title/about them and their doings . 
  literally / r/cringe, 
  i do n't think they take into account the fact that 4 of those 15 public holidays here are basically rescheduled for work on the next/nearest saturday . 
  holiday | date | work rescheduled for --------- | : ---------- :| : ---------- :| new year | jan 2 | jan 24 liberation day | march 2 | march 21 independence day | sept 21 | sept 12 new year | dec 31 | dec 12 so , umm , yeah . . `` 15 '' holidays . 
  i watched it live on eurovision 's youtube channel with headphones and there definitely were boos when countries gave high points to russia . 
  the audience found a way around the anti-booing technology of the producers by extending their boos after the initial fake/enhanced applause sounds , a.k.a. 
  the applause sounds lasted for like 8-10 second and the audience would ( continue ) boo ( ing ) for about 5-8 seconds more so they can be heard . 
  my understanding is that the voter wanted to vote science in . 
  haha  who knows though . . we can only speculate . . 
  best to wait for a while . 
  maybe someone will make one . 
  in the words of a not-so-well-known drag queen : * my basement is flooded !,

  ftfy :p, 
  and malta should be half-blue , half-green since they introduced civil unions in april , last year . 
  it 's not that . 
  it was promoted through the planetromeo.com gay dating website , which is based in the netherlands and has been around for 10 years . 
  it 's fairly new on the world stage as its previous name was gayromeo.com and was mostly and specifically oriented towards the european msm community . 
  i would even speculate that it was the first internet platform that gathered a large bdsm-interested gay men for the groups that is has on the topic and the people there were/are mostly from germany . 
  this also explains the very few respondents from countries outside europe . 
  lastly , even in the report it says :  the survey was a collaboration between planetromeo.com and a research team at the department of communication at the johannes gutenberg university in mainz , germany ( jgu ) . 
  the website promoted it and recruited people , whereas the university gathered and analysed the stats . 
  kinda . 
  the first story that pops up in google search on it is from catholic-news . bg ( you can guess what it says ) , then there are 2 articles from different news sites with the same text , taken from [ this french article ] ( http://www.lejdd.fr/international/europe/video-le-grand-angle-diplo-l-europe-divorcee-sur-le-mariage-homo-732610 ) , then there is an article that cites [ this rt\u00c9 article ] ( http://www.rte.ie/news/2015/0219/681528-referendum/ ) as well as [ this article from the guardian ] ( http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/20/irish-voters-to-decide-on-same-sex-marriage-in-may-referendum ) , then there is one citing the irish times and that 's about it . 
  the rest are old articles ( about the announcement of the referendum in 2013 ) . 
  i participated in this survey ( and even [ posted the link to the questionnaire here on r/europe back then ] ( http://np.www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2pwm5m/academic_gay_rights_monitor_2014_survey_available/ ) ) . 
  i 'm currently in the works of several maps that 'll show some of the findings from the survey . 
  i 'm only taking the countries ' results , whose sample size is representative enough ( confidence interval up to 5 max ) , so look forward to that . 
  thank you , nonetheless . 
  the reason i asked about that is to see whether the argument ` it 's expensive ! ', 
  could be potentially used against the implementation of this type of voting and if it 's possible to debunk that argument with actual numbers . 
  thanks !, 
  do you have any info on my budget question ? 
  how much of the municipal/cantonal/federal bidget is spent for these ? 
  have they ever published any numbers on it ? 
  also , what time is required to respond to the letter ? 
  i take it there are postal offices at hand and it 's not a nightmare ( like in some other countries ) to send your answers ? 
  thanks !, 
  just a tip : next time you self-reference , please , put a link to the comment you would like the person to refer themselves to , otherwise they may not find it and thus spark confusion . 
  what are the requirements for an amendment to the swiss constitution to pass/be adopted ? 
  honestly , lokomotiv and botev ( plovdiv ) fans are no better . 
  do they go to districts of sofia with predominantly roma communities after a match ` to beat up some gypsies and let some steam out ' , like loko and botev fans do here ? 
  / u/slyratchet i think it 's time to add the qualifiers , no ? 
   they are : * albania * armenia * russia * romania * hungary * greece * estonia * georgia * serbia * belgium source : https://twitter.com/eurovision/status/600770435240882179 moldova , the netherlands , f.y.r. 
  macedonia , belarus , denmark and finland [ did n't qualify ] ( https://twitter.com/eurovision/status/600771439059410945 ) . 
  i only open my twitter when the eurovision is on . 
  the commentary there is super amusing to read while watching . 
  i do n't know what hit me last night to check , but i did and it was n't until this post came up that i realised i messed the dates . 
  haha, 
  thank you for this !, 
  last night when i checked the dates i saw it was on the 19th and thought i missed it since it was at like 2 a.m. , but it did n't clock in me that it 's the 19th already . 
  lol i 'm all stacked and have the youtube live link open . 
  my body is ready !, 
  it 's an artificial word so such rules do n't apply . 
  nobody actually uses it , unless they is playing smartass . 
  do n't act unconstitutionally / against the constitution 2 . 
  ** \u045d ** ( the shortest one that can be used in a formal speech ) - tr . 
  hers , to her first one is officially the longest one ( if that has n't been changed yet ) , while the second one could be replaced with '' \u0430 '' ( and , whereas , whilst ) , '' \u0435 '' ( v. , he/she/it is ) or '' \u0438 '' ( and ) . 
  edit : just did some research and it seems the actual official longest word is ** \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0442\u0445\u0438\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043c\u043e\u044a\u0433\u044a\u043b\u043d\u0438\u043a ** , which is the grammatically correct writing of [ this ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65537-gon ) . 
  sofia region ( stolitsa ) should be in the second bracket there as well : http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=pat_ep_rtot&amp;lang=en, 
  thanks , but it 's not by nuts3 . . 
  i searched the code pat_ep_rtot aaand there is [ no data ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=pat_ep_rtot&amp;lang=en ) for either 2007 or 2006 there . 
  anyone else unable to find the data ? 
  well , it 's still kind of depressing . 
  not in a british-isles-weather type of depressing , but in it 's own way . 
  you 'll find out once you visit . 
  what 's the route you 're planning to go through ? 
   you def gon see some shit yeah . 
  like the [ baba vida fortress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baba_vida ) , the [ belograchik rocks ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belogradchik_rocks ) & [ fortress ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belogradchik_fortress ) , [ castra martis ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/castra_martis ) and the [ magura cave ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magura_cave ) ( where you can see some 11 000 years old [ drawings like this one ] ( http://www.rupestre.net/tracce/wp-content/gallery/magura/24maguracave.jpg ) , more photos [ here ] ( http://www.rupestre.net/tracce/?p=8097 ) ) .
