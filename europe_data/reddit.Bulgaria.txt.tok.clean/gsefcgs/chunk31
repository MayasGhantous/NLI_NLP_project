  he 's from scotland , what do you think ? 
  i see . 
  well , we 're known to be very welcoming so if you decide to do a sole trip and if you decide to come here , feel free to pop in / r/bulgaria and ask any questions that you may have . 
  bulgaria / bulgaria / i have n't made up my mind yet, 
  it 's not a circus . 
  lol it 's a roman stadium . 
  where did you plan on going with your friend ? 
  lol circus ? 
  but i did n't downvote you . . 
  it was a tongue-in-cheek joke , because the [ ministry of economy , energy and tourism - `` tourism '' directorate ] ( https://www.google.bg/maps/place/%d0%9c%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b5%d1%80%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b2%d0%be+%d0%bd%d0%b0+%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%be%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0+%d0%b5%d0%bd%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b3%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%b8%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0+%d0%b8+%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%b7%d0%bc%d0%b0+-+%d0%94%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%8f+%22%d0%a2%d1%83%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%b7%d1%8a%d0%bc%22/@42.1481783,24.7490194,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xaf8838c25a1ef5b5 ) is here . 
  that 's all . 
   many people miss out on going to ~ ~ sofia , veliko tarnovo and varna ~ ~ ** plovdiv ** ftfy :p, 
  well , even i have gone on a vacation in sunny beach , but it 's a 2-3 times thing . 
  from thereon it just becomes somewhat tiring rather than actually having some rest . 
  bottom line is that it all depends on what experience the tourist wants to have . 
  24/7 party zone and nothing else . 
  i 'd recommend exploring other resorts where you can visit/go to historic/cultural/nature sites . 
  same here , buddy . . maybe next time . .

  well , then . 
  i hope you 're happy with your job and life . 
  how 's studies ? 
  if they 're gon na start the article with :  * would angela merkel 's christian democrats lie to the right of mariano rajoy 's people 's party in spain ? 
  is the british labour party to the left of other centre-left parties in europe ? 
  * why on earth did n't they at least colour the parties that countries ' pm/president/chancellor belongs to differently in that figure ? 
  would have been waaaay easier to read the graphic . 
  also , i have no idea who the noa and ndst parties are . 
  the ods has never been a party , but a [ coalition of parties ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_people%27s_union ) and does n't exist enymore . 
  kzb is also an [ alliance ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coalition_for_bulgaria ) , not a party . 
  ah , yes . 
  90 000 holders of a passport that provides free movement accross some of the most wealthy countries in the world , where they can go and look for better job opportunities/life/health care conditions , but no they just sit there * in macedonia * , waiting for shit to hit the fan so they can cross the border with * bulgaria * , en mass !, 
  what logic is that ? 
  borissov , you populist prick . 
  i think it is a mistake by op in the tittle . 
  it should be q1 2015 , seeing as [ this is the actual source of the chart ] ( http://www.portfolio.hu/en/economy/hungary_may_not_make_it_to_the_eu_top3_in_terms_of_q1_growth.29585.html ) . 
  what may have confused op is the fact that right before the chart there is this sentence :  on a year-on-year basis , hungary , germany , estonia , greece , lithuania and the united kingdom recorded slowdown compared to the fourth quarter last year . 
  looking at the stats , [ this ] ( http://www.portfolio.hu/img/upload/2015/05/150513eugdp02.jpg ) is the chart they probably refer to , not the one posted by op . 
  do n't get me wrong though , i do n't blame op for making a mistake . 
  i blame whoever wrote that article for placing the charts irrespectively of the text .

  [ thread ] ( http://redd.it/35p4io ) . 
  most are from eritrea , somalia , nigeria , guinea and egypt . 
  both really . 
  there are very few level-headed scientists from the bulgarian academy of science , who refuse to speculate about whatever findings . 
  [ fixed that one for you ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5fuchsx.png ) :p, 
  so the answer is children being accounted for less than 1 person ? 
  ( i do n't really know how the legislation defines it , so that is why i ask ), 
  erm , is it me or am i seeing that estonia 's 5 sudanese represent 35 % of all asylum applicants , while the 5 kosovars and the 5 syrians represent 20 % each , respectively ? 
  latvia 's 0 egyptians and 0 nigerians 8.3 % , respectively ?? 
  how is 0 number of a number making any percentage points ? 
  iceland 's 5 iranians are 18.8 % of all while the 5 afghani and the 5 guineans are 9.4 % of all , respectively ? 
  i do n't get it . 
  can someone explain how can that be ? 
  that does n't deter one from trying though . 
  from the article :  '' * it is hard to say what exactly it was used for . 
  it may have been a regular * *** children 's toy *** * but it is also quite possible that this item had some kind of a function in the * *** religious practices of the ancient thracians , *** * for example , with * *** clairvoyance . 
  *** * however , we have no way of knowing much about that because this period , the second millennium bc , was * *** a time devoid of the written word . 
  *** '' , prof. nikolay ovcharov has explained , as cited by the bulgarian national radio . 
  historians/media love using ` oldest ' around here when it comes to stuff that 's found . 
  the ` toy ' part in the title is simply for sensation . 
  it 's not that i know him well , we ( bulgarian redditors on r/europe ) are so few that it 's easy to notice/follow what any of us do/say in the sub . 
  plus , he was one of the first bulgarian redditors i noticed being super active in the sub when i subscribed ( back then he had a flair / was jumping from being flaired to not being flaired ) . 
  gogo used to have a flair before , for a very brief period - 2 weeks ( or something like that ) . 
  then he changed it to a eu flair for , probably , a day or so , until he un-flaired . 
  [ serbian wiki ] ( https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9d%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%b5%d0%b1%d0%b0%d1%80 ) has more photos . 
  if you 're going to sunny beach , you are sure to pass through/by nessebar as sb is directly to the north of it . 
  i definitely recommend taking a walk around nessebar before you go get bolloxed in sb . 
  do n't know for beauty , but our smallest town is [ melnik ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melnik,_bulgaria ) . 
  the town is an architectural reserve and 96 % of all its buildings are cultural monuments . 
  with a population of 385 , it is the smallest town around here and has retained its city status today for historical reasons . 
  * [ gallery/article ] ( http://www.adventureflair.com/melnik-bulgaria/ ) * [ drone video of melnik ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqgrp2j5lfc ) other than that maybe [ nessebar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nesebar ) . 
  it is a city-museum basically and a unesco world heritage site since 1983 .

  eh , all 's good . 
   i hope someone tells them before this hits the news outside of italy as i 'm sure our far-right nationalists would probably like to have a word with that guy . 
  in previous years when this was held , have you been to the bulgarian-themed caff\u00e8 ? 
  do you remember what they served you , if you did ? 
  mangia !, 
  :d interesting food they 're serving at the bulgarian-themed caff\u00e8 . 
  is that cheese with wine and banitsa , i 'm seeing ? 
  lol also , our flag seems to be put upside-down ( looking at pictures 4 and 13 there ) . 
  it should be [ like this ] ( http://www.dimodi.com/blog/plovdiv/plovdiv_girl_flag.jpg ) . 
  the one with the girl in traditional clothing among roses is obviously from finland . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ hehe ^ ^ ^ ^ , 
  this one is correct . 
  well , she 's danish . 
  i do . 
  back in 1995 my mother was invited by her best friend from her childhood years to visit her in spain for easter ( or summer , i do n't remember those details ) . 
  know what happened ? 
  why ? 
  political instability + the fact that bulgaria was blacklisted for the schengen area ( [ reference ] ( http://eur-lex.europa.eu/lexuriserv/lexuriserv.do?uri=celex:31995r2317:en:html ) , it was de-listed in the year of 2000 ) so ` we have a strict number of visas to issue and you 're late ' ( a.k.a. 
  give us money under the table and we * might * issue you a visa ) . 
  my mother refused to give any money , so she never went and was devastated for at least a month . 
  she is since then scarred and the idea of travelling abroad somewhat scares her to this day . 
  when i see the europe/eu flag , especially the sign on airports for eu/eea/ch citizens , i am reminded that i have rights my parents did n't have the opportunity to enjoy for most of their lives . 
  surrounded .
