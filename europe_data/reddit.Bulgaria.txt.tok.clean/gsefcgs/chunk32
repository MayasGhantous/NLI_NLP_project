  it was pretty much the same situation here when we did n't have a government the previous two years . 
  life continues with or without a government .

  how many times will the church be marking 1150 years ?!? 
  christianisation began in 864 c.e. 
  ( and even earlier ; it was the tsar that was baptised in 864 , renaming himself from boris to mihail / michael / ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/christianization_of_bulgaria edit : downvoters , please , explain yourselves . 
  2015 minus 864 *** is *** 1151 , not 1150 .

   ask bulgarians if gasoline is expensive , and they 'll shake their head back and forth . 
  because in bulgaria , shaking your head means yes ( and nodding means no ) . 
  so much insightful information , the economist . 
  / s  with an average daily income of just $ 21 a day and middling gas prices , it 's a burden for bulgarians to fill up . 
  it takes 27 percent of a bulgarian 's daily wages to buy a gallon of gas -- the seventh-most-acute pain at the pump in the ranking . 
  this is why i walk places . 
  i can thus save those 27 percent for kiselo mlyako . 
  so i get food + sexy legs and on top of that i do n't feed them russian oligarchs . 
  to be honest , i do n't necessarily agree with the summary on wiki ( it could have been worse ) , but if you wish you can edit it and add more info . 
   one if our most popular novel is called tobacco i 'd like to note that the novel is popular not because it 's about tobacco , but because it is well-written and intriguing . 
  it could 've easily been titled `` corn '' & be about a corn flour factory and still be a masterpiece . 
  here 's a * very * short summary of the [ novel ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dimitar_dimov#biography ) :  dimov 's `` tobacco '' is the story of the socialist ( read : communist ) movement in bulgaria the pre-wwii era . 
  the whole work from cover to cover , tries to enter the reader in the struggle of the tobacco workers to survive , to organize against the landowner 's oppression - and as a consequence against their political role in the mid-war era . 
   from this work , dimov is trying to show the significance of the organized struggle , contacted by the young communist party of bulgaria against the land-owners in affiliation to the newly founded soviet union . 
   tobacco became the `` bible '' of the communists in the balkan region , as it shows how working class can become from a bunch of slaves to the ruling class in a country . 
  and that is mainly the reason the dimov was widely respected among the bulgarians , even after the 1988 turn over . 
  the novel is comprised of 2 books with about 860 pages in total , so the above is a really , really , * really * short synpopsis . 
  unfortunately it has never been fully translated in english or in any non - ( ex ) communist country language . 
  it 's been translated in chinese ( mandarin , iirc ) , czech , latvian , german , polish , romanian , russian , slovak and ukrainian . 
   1:12 -1:45 is ukrainian i could only catch \u043e\u0439 \u0437\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u044e ( oh , mountain ) , \u043a\u043e\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438 ( christmas has ) and \u0447\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439 ( black ) , but that 's about it . 
  the rest are words i could not make out at all . 
  i could only find the part that starts at 01:45 in your video , more specifically it 's from here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=da_lwdu_bv4#t=190 i do n't know about specific subreddits for these kind of things , but one thing i could tell you for sure is that most if not all of the songs in your video are in russian .

   yougov has surveyed how the british public would vote in an eu referendum on 72 occasions starting in september 2010 that does n't make 10 years , dear politico writer . 
   the general public hardly worries at all about europe , and worries even less when asked to think about it . 
   one way of looking at this is just to assume that the public is crassly indifferent . 
  would n't that be worrying for the rest ? 
  is n't indifference possibly the worst of all ? 
  i mean , scepticism can bring in necessary critique on some issues and consequently reform for the better , and support can ensure ( new ) ideas , laws , initiatives and whatnot are being started and implemented , whereas indifference is sitting in the middle , barely doing anything , all the while you have every right to take a stance . 
  this could very well be temporary , but thoughts ? 
  i was just informed that finland 's signatory was the ( then ) permanent representative of finland to the eu eikka kosonen . 
  checked him on google and it seemed to match , so i changed it in the album now . 
  it 's no longer a secret !, 
   mr. juncker is the only one who is still relevant , is n't he ? 
  i do n't know for relevancy , but pierre sellal is [ still ] ( http://europa.eu/whoiswho/public/index.cfm?fuseaction=idea.hierarchy&amp;nodeid=4180&amp;lang=en ) the permanent representative of france to the eu and meglena kuneva is [ currently ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_borisov_government#cabinet ) the deputy prime minister in charge of eu policies and institutional matters over here . 
  edit : formatting, 
  the photos are mostly from here : http://www.eu2005.lu/en/actualites/photos/2005/04/25traite/ ~ ~ i could n't find the name of the signatory on behalf of finland . 
  does anyone recognize him ? ~ ~ i was just informed that finland 's signatory is the ( then ) permanent representative of finland to the eu eikka kosonen . 
  i took the names of the signatories from here : http://www.eu2005.lu/en/medias/who_is_who/25signature/whoiswho.pdf info on national parliaments ' approval here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_accession_2005#history edit : finland . 
   if you think that `` your 1 vote '' does not matter at all , then maybe you did not grasp the full concept of democracy . 
  i do n't . 
  i only asked you a question so as to understand your first comment . 
   and if you prefer to re-elect those , who betrayed young girls and let them mercilessly be raped only because those young girls were native british girls , then maybe you could do society a favour and refrain from going to the ballot . 
  erm , you remember that this whole thread is about the hypothetical situation , where we 're all british and are registered to vote in the upcoming uk general elections , right ? 
   at least the children would be thankful for one person less on earth who does not care at all about them and - above that - tries to inflict even more pain on them by ever and ever re-electing these girls ' perpetrators . 
  the snp and/or the greens were the perpetrators of the incidents in rotherham ? 
   i wish you a nice day , good sir . 
  nice day to you , too . 
   may the souls of the raped children have mercy with you . 
   does n't that mean letting the whole uk become like rotherham ? 
  woah , woah , hold on !, 
  my 1 ( one ! ), 
  vote for either snp or the greens would make `` the whole of the uk become like rotherham '' ?? 
  really now ? 
  what 's the logic behind this ? 
  please , elaborate as i do n't get it at all . 
  either snp or the greens . 
  since it 's not linked in the article , here 's the report mentioned therein : [ click ] ( http://www.cushmanwakefield.com/~/media/global-reports/international%20investment%20atlas%202015%20-%20overview%20pdf.pdf ) . 
  i see we have retained our # 1 spot as the most unhappy nation in europe . 
  ( there 's improvement though , last time we were 144th/156 , if i 'm not mistaken ), 
  it * is * accurate since it shows data for [ nuts 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nuts_of_bulgaria#nuts_codes ) regions . 
  your example would be relevant in a nuts 3 map . 
   do you guys study such things as syntax , morphology and semantics ? 
  things like `` genetive construction '' , `` dependent clause '' ? 
  yes . 
   do you have to study `` noun complements '' , for example .
