  what is it like ? 
  i 'm afraid i 'd need an example to answer properly . 
   also , when you guys apply for uni , is it required to write a text about a given theme ? 
  here , we are often demanded to write a text on themes like `` defense of infancy '' , `` immigration '' or `` traffic deaths '' , presenting a solution `` respecting human rights '' . 
  yes ; see [ matura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matura ) . 
  i 'm more worried about the collection of dick pics sent to me , including through facebook messages ( which are still there ) . 
  for real though , i had one guy send me pics every day until i blocked him . 
  i 'd really like to know what consequences he could have faced had i reported him to the authorities . 
  err til . . 
  i know a few guys , who can get in trouble . 
  do you have a link to the law ? 
  or what should i be looking for ? 
   odly i think romantic partners are some of the people who 're most willing to actually share their language with you , where as almost everybody else feels socially awkward about it or something . 
  and here i am , a person who had like 5 greek ( ex ) boyfriends and all i know is kalispera , efkharisto , molivi and ( their favourite ) * ela , glipse tin putsamou * . 
  had good times with them nonetheless . 
  so bulgaria is only represented by those , who answered the question , in your view ? 
  why ? 
  i like how this video has subs in 7 languages , including english . 
  i say great work altogether !, 
  that red dot you see in the middle of bulgaria is the municipality of [ rakovski ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rakovski_%28town%29 ) . 
  in brief , the story about their catholicism is : somewhere in the 17th century the mayor there found a way ( unspecified ) to implement a more lax tax system for catholics so everyone and their catholic mothers moved there . 
  - end - this \\ ^ is what people from that town have told me ( and they like talking about their catholicness ) . 
   ~ ~ 76 % ~ ~ [ 59.4 % ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orthodoxy_by_country#statistics ) consider themselves orthodox ftfy . 
  and as u/awdsns said , it is just a very dark shade of purple actually , but i get that it looks dark blue . 
   modern landscape  [ buzludzha ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/buzludzha ) really now ? 
  * shamelessly tags / u/gschizas * ^ ^ ^ ^ please , ^ ^ ^ ^ see ^ ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ above ^ ^ ^ ^ can ^ ^ ^ ^ work ^ ^ ^ ^ with ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ sub ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ take ^ ^ ^ ^ into ^ ^ ^ ^ consideration ^ ^ ^ ^ its ^ ^ ^ ^ eventual ^ ^ ^ ^ implementation . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ thanks !, 
   forbidding gay marriage is n't discriminatory because `` gay people can already marry the opposite sex , '' like they 're supposed to . 
  did anyone from the other parties respond to this ? 
  and what did they say ? 
  please , tell me someone did . . 
   needle in polish is [ ... ] ig\u0142a same here -  \u0438\u0433\u043b\u0430 ( igla ) . 
  we also have \u0445\u0443\u0439 ( hui or chuj in polish ) . 
  i 'll check the etymology now . 
  edit : found something , not sure if it 's to be trusted . 
  the word khui/chuj * may * come from the indo-european word [ * \u011dheu - * ] ( http://indo-european.info/pokorny-etymological-dictionary/whnjs.htm ) , which means * to disappear * , * to get away * . 
  am i the only one , who can not watch the second video ? 
  :( anyone have a working link ? 
  please ? 
  thanks !, 
  i noticed that , too . 
  must be hist signature . 
  also , the expression '' [ with a ] clear mind '' springs to mind . 
  this is so awesome !, 
  i wonder why the artist decided to paint their hair white even though they appear to be young . 
  edit : i found who the artist is . 
  his name is [ joe caslin ] ( http://joecaslin.com/ ) . 
  here 's [ the sketch of the mural ] ( http://joecaslin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/joe-caslin-mariage-equality.jpg ) . 
  also , according to [ this article ] ( http://www.herald.ie/news/i-hope-giant-mural-of-two-men-will-further-gay-marriage-debate-says-artist-31136518.html ) the mural is based on the painting [ the meeting on the turret stairs ] ( http://www.nationalgallery.ie/en/collection/irelands_favourite_painting/burton.aspx ) about a princess and her bodyguard , who fall in love but are n't allowed to marry . 
  and it is said that another mural of two women will be installed at another location in dublin/ireland later this week . 
  could not find any explanation as to my question though . 
  any irish people around that know what 's the deal with the white hair ? 
   for real ? 
  where the hell do you look for jobs ? 
  newspaper ads ??!?!? 
  well , they could be looking for jobs through the local labour bureau offices as well . 
  that and through siblings / acquaintances . 
  you 're welcome !, 
   you can also check www.votewatch.eu , where you 'll be able to see past votes of the ep and the council of the eu , as well as per country , per type of vote and per attitude voting . 
  i 'm not gon na call you weird or crazy . 
  you have to take into account that a large portion of young people do not use internet banking . 
  i think it said like 23 % only use it , so that 's 77 % who do n't . 
  also , how many bulgarian online stores advertise sales of videos/music/movies or even offer those ? 
  like 2 ? 
  lastly , some of us are old-fashioned and go to the local videoteka ( movie store ) and rent dvd/blu-ray films from those , or go to the local music store to buy cds or dvds , or go to the local pc and the like store to buy software . 
  not all of us are tech savvy . 
  i do n't even have a smartphone and frankly , i do n't even need such a phone . . of course , i can also be a precedence in that regard . . 
   could you explain a bit ? 
  yes , sure . 
    what does the + , - and 0 mean ? 
  here you go : * '' + '' means `` voted in favour '' * '' - '' means `` voted against '' * `` 0 '' means `` abstained ''  what \u00b4 s the combination of letters infront of the list of name ? 
  ex : alde : au\u0161trevi\u010dius , bearder , becerra basterrechea ... alde , gue/ngl are the [ political groups in the ep ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_groups_of_the_european_parliament ) . 
  the names after those are the surnames of the meps , belonging to the respective political group . 
  you mean , if i study in it and become programmer or tester , i will no longer get bills ? 
  / joking :d what i meant to say is that i moved out when i was 16 , so i beat you to it . 
  i first checked there , but it was n't . 
  so i went on to hunt the vote on ep 's website . 
  maybe votewatch will update in the next few days . 
  yes . 
  it 's in [ this pdf ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-%2f%2fep%2f%2fnonsgml%2bpv%2b20150415%2bres-rcv%2bdoc%2bpdf%2bv0%2f%2fen&amp;language=en ) , pages 11 and 12 . 
  16 here . 
  what do i get ? 
  oh , yeah - bills . 
  once you click ` start ' and it displays the themes , a `` modify your selection '' button appears right under the ` eurostat [ logo ] ' . 
  it 's not flexible though , so it 's basically a ` start over ' button . 
   you are part of the ** 95 % ** of young men your age , who do ** not ** buy films or music online . 
   ** 98 % ** for women . 
  * chuckles *, 
  i lost mine somewhere in my home . 
  wish clicking a link on the internet would get it back to me . 
  ise innocent !, 
  i do n't know what or who / u / is . 
  is he a cool guy ? 
  i 've read your reply and i 'm currently finishing a long and thought-provoking answer , any minute now . . ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ joking ^ ^ ^ ^ actually , ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ ^ get ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ thing ^ ^ ^ ^ :d, 
   redditor for 1 month this explains a lot about your comment . 
  let me tell you a story . 
  * once upon a time there was a boy , named / u/naurgul . 
  he used to get exceptionally eloquent on many topics , giving us , readers and lurkers , life and belief that a reasonable discussion can be had . 
  * * one day , a big wooden horse ( much like the trojan one ) arrived in / r/europe , presenting itself as st. ormfront . 
  that horse chased the boy around everywhere , attacking him with his ( copy - ) pasta-looking cake and persuaded him to its most suitable ( for its attacks ) corner - a million km / or miles / away in the very right .
