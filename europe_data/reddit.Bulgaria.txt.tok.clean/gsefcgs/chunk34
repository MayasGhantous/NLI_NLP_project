  the boy then declared he 's tired of all that chasing and decided he 'd retire young . 
  * * the boy aged and aged , and aged , and with age , he decided he can only try to point out the flaws of users ' opinions . 
  yup , he became a bitter old fart , but with a sense of preservation . 
  * * but do n't worry , there is still energy in him - it 's just that he channels it to a different direction : teaching / u/savannajeff on how to survive * *** a *** * debate ( on ttip ) on the sub .

  you can now go and play , young one ~ ~, 
   coding was n't / u/gschizas into that kind of stuff ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ hint ^ ^ ^ ^ hint ^ ^ ^ ^ , 
  i think we 've seen [ worse than that ] ( http://imgur.com/uz4qne4 ) poster . 
  the party got , like , 0.037 % votes in the end , but that ( prospect ) still did n't stop them to paste those posters everywhere . 
  health and wellness [ * life expectancy * , * premature deaths from non-communicable diseases * ( probability of dying between the ages 30 and 70 from cardiovascular disease , cancer , diabetes , or chronic respiratory disease ) , * obesity rate * ( % of pop . 
  ) , * outdoor air pollution attributable deaths * ( deaths/100 000 ; number of deaths resulting from emissions from industrial activity , households , cars and trucks , expressed as the rate per 100 000 people . ), 
  and * suicide rate * ] 2 . 
  ecosystem sustainability [ * greenhouse gas emissions * ( co2 equivalents per gdp ) , * water withdrawals as a percentage of resources * and * biodiversity and habitat * ] 3 . 
  tolerance and inclusion [ * tolerance for immigrants * , * tolerance for homosexuals * , * discrimination and violence against minorities * , * religious tolerance * and * community safety net * ( percentage of respondents answering yes to the question , `` if you were in trouble , do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them , or not ? '' ) ] basically , that 's all . 
  i ca n't help , but read all the comments in this thread with that accent now . 
   inb4 balkans ca n't into eu . . and south-eastern thrace . . who would have thought . 
  i 'm an atheist as well and that \\ ^ is exactly what the fat person in me is screaming all the damn time . 
  ! 11 but really , what should ` bed & breakfast ' mean ? 
  stay at home . 
  i have enough food and mineral water to survive for about 3 weeks . 
  then , i 'll organise a party for all the three-handed/four-boobed/two-dicked people around . 
  well , then that observation reeks ignorance . 
  i see , but they are not the norm . 
  a father can be a mother and vice versa in heterosexual couples and this couple you speak of may seem like your stereotypical/traditional heterosexual couple with the only exception that one side is n't female , but they may in reality be not this hetero-normative as you may think . 
  gay couples usually levitate around the two ` roles ' , because they can and are not as stereotypical as straight couples are , so to say . 
  thus , it is not ok to state ` even gay couples have a male and female personality ' and put them into this ` hetero-normative box ' of yours . 
  some are like that , but they are mostly a minority . 
  that was n't really an explanation . 
  please , elaborate . 
   he was clearly the male in the relation how did you arrive to that conclusion ? 
  err , not really . 
  only in the cases of `` only top '' guy/butch girl + `` only bottom '' guy/lipstick girl and those relationships do n't last much . 
  then again , how do you define `` male personality '' and `` female personality '' ? 
  here , have more of that : https://www.pinterest.com/mucksnipe/foreign-legion/ :3 ( you can also google images for `` d\u00eda de la hispanidad legion '' to get more :p ), 
   `` not to mention how much we spent on soothsayers , philosophers and ** young boys for our soldiers to have sex with ** . 
  you think they worked for free ? '' asked mardas . 
  yeah , that 'd totally work with iran . 
  :d  at press time greece had officially informed the government of turkey that it would forget about the whole ottoman empire thing if it could just borrow , like , 50 bucks . 
  i 'm at a loss of words and in tears . 
  about time . 
  i hope r&d spending rises now . 
  it 's the same here . 
  it hurt just typing my comment above/reading your comment reply . 
  let 's close the discussion here , please . . :(, 
  completely agree . 
  i never got to see some of my grandfathers and uncles ( and a few aunts ) alive , simply because they were * rumoured * to be dissidents/agrarians/whatever and all we got is this : http://lex.bg/laws/ldoc/2134920192 - a law , declaring the communist regime as criminal with nobody actually convicted through it . 
  hey there , buddy !, 
  i 'll be happy to receive a pic or two , if that 'd make you feel better !, 
   ^ ^ ^ only ^ ^ ^ if ^ ^ ^ you 're ^ ^ ^ bi/gay ^ ^ ^ though . 
  ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ straight-guys-chaser . 
  $ 0.669 - $ 0.884 / m \u00b3 here in plovdiv . 
  i hear varna and burgas pay more than that ( like $ 1.22 ) , not sure how true that is . 
  could be just a rumour . 
  detailed summary , complete data tables and all other goodies can be found here : [ click ] ( http://www.oecd.org/dac/stats/development-aid-stable-in-2014-but-flows-to-poorest-countries-still-falling.htm ) . 
  ( scroll down to find the data ), 
  i can , but that 's because i have one friend on fb that 's obsessed with new russian ( and turkish ) music artists . 
  examples : * [ some moscovite hipster hip-hoppers , singing about beards ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mvqaee58om ) * [ a cutie ( latvian russian ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-553mtwyrbw ) * [ some chicks , singing about armistice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cskhoqrqmse ) i would n't call these ` excellent ' , but they 're decent more or so . 
  i wonder how your bot missed to point out that / u/kratistos ' username means ` most excellent ' ( a.k.a. 
  * stronkest *  ) in greek / \u03ba\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 / , thus a tad bit more of an ego going on in him/his personality . 
  :d no offence to him though . 
  / u/nitoko , you goof . 
  bulgaria did not force the eu to adopt the bulgarian cyrillic as the official cyrillic script of the union . 
   initially , the [ ecb ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_central_bank ) and the [ european commission ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_commission ) insisted that bulgaria change the name it uses for the [ euro ] currency from ** \u0415\u0412\u0420\u041e ** to ** \u0415\u0423\u0420\u041e ** , claiming the currency should have an official and standard spelling across the eu . 
  ** bulgaria on the other hand stated that it wants to take into account ** the different alphabet and ** the principle of phonetic orthography in the bulgarian language ** . 
  [ [ 9 ] ] ( http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/to-the-editor-oyro-yuro-or-evro/id_18641/catid_27 )  the issue was decisively resolved in favour of bulgaria at the [ 2007 eu summit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_eu_summit ) in [ lisbon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lisbon ) , allowing bulgaria to use the cyrillic spelling ** \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e ** on all official eu documents . 
  [ [ 10 ] ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/companynewsandpr/idusl1868684020071018 ) [ [ 11 ] ] ( http://www.sofiaecho.com/article/evro-dispute-over--portuguese-foreign-minister/id_25576/catid_66 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_issues_concerning_the_euro#bulgarian the ` different alphabet ' part did not play that much of a role as it was mainly the second part - the [ phonetic orthography ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phonemic_orthography ) of the bulgarian language that actually mattered to the case and was played as the main argument . 
  adopting the bulgarian cyrillic as the 3rd script of the eu was ** a given ** . 
  same like with the greek alphabet . 
  greece or cyprus did not have to * fight * for its/their \u03b1\u03bb\u03c6\u03ac\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf to be adopted as the 2nd official script of the eu . 
  now , let 's talk about ** real issues ** . 
  where are you favourite [ patriotic front ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriotic_front_%28bulgaria%29 ) loonies and why are n't they more vocal on the issues and/of the reforms of the judiciary ? 
  i ca n't find this quote in the article . 
  where did you get it from ? 
  i 'm genuinely interested . 
  beside being a euro homo nazi for r/russia and hardcore leftist sjw for r/european , i think i can live through being on another list . 
  thank you , but not really !, 
  haha my memory is bad , it 's just that i had remembered them as they are one of the rare gems around ( redditors from countries that are highly unrepresented on the sub like armenia , georgia etc. ), 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ actually ^ ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^ have ^ ^ ^ ^ a ^ ^ ^ ^ list ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ names ^ ^ ^ ^ of ^ ^ ^ ^ reddit ^ ^ ^ ^ users ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ had ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ flairs ^ ^ ^ ^ from ^ ^ ^ ^ malta , ^ ^ ^ ^ andorra , ^ ^ ^ ^ luxembourg , ^ ^ ^ ^ armenia , ^ ^ ^ ^ georgia ^ ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ ^ liechtenstein . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ creepy , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ right ? 
  paging / u/cool _ lady and / u/tigranater . 
  that 's about the only two redditors that i know around here that have armenian flair . 
   you can also try and ask in / r/armenia or / r/armenian . 
  you 're welcome . 
  i 've been travelling by train most of my life . 
  even when i was in high school i was travelling through the early train at 6:40 a.m. 
  and got back home with the one at 2p . m. 
  ( 5:50 p.m. 
  in 8th grade ) . 
  currently the railway track from sofia to istanbul is being upgraded , in particular they transfer all passengers to buses from dimitrovgrad to kapikule and from thereon another 2 buses will come to take you to istanbul . 
  i do n't know if the railway track will be fully ready by the next year . 
  actually , it does n't matter as the trips by bus is during the night ( here 's the [ schedule ( pfd ) ] ( http://bdz.bg/files/2012/raz_bdz/491.pdf ) ) and you arrive in istanbul in the morning ( i 've done the trip last year ) . 
   ( bulgaria , macedonia [ ... ] by train just a heads-up : there is no direct train connection between bulgaria and macedonia . 
  you 'll have to go to thessaloniki and then head to skopje . 
  the only way to go from sofia to skopje is by bus or car . 
  the train connection is planned to be completed by 2022 as construction is set to start this year . 
   the pharaohs were thracians . 
  and there are pyramids in the rhodopes .
