  naturally , it started raining soon afterwards . . 
  oh , of course he [ did ] ( http://novanews.bg/news/view/2015/03/25/105776/%d0%b7%d0%b0%d0%b1%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%85%d0%b0-%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%81%d0%ba%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b0%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%8f%d1%82%d0%b0-%d0%bf%d1%80%d0%b8-%d1%81%d0%bc%d1%8f%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b0/?utm_source=news&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=hot ) . 
  and as a typical kremlin-asslicker he also [ proposed ] ( ftp : / / 193.109.55.85 / 25_03_2015 / 554-02-40_pr_premahv . na % 20vizov % 20rezhim . pdf ) ( taken from [ here ] ( http://parliament.bg/bg/doc ) liberalisation of the visa regime for russians . 
  waiting to see if that has passed . 
  in case anyone is wondering , i put an asterisk there so as to note that ` trans ' includes all transgender , non-binary , and gender nonconforming identities , including ( but not limited to ) transgender , transvestite , transsexual , genderfuck , genderqueer , genderless , genderfluid , agender , non-gendered , non-binary , two-spirit , third gender , bigender , and trans man and trans woman . 
  also , it has already been updated on wiki : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lgbt_rights_in_europe#southern_europe, 
  switch to bulgarian ( phonetic traditional ) and then hold shift and press 5 . 
  it should give you the $ sign . 
   a priest in secular countries ( aka most of europe ) , afaik , a couple can enter into marriage by signing the documents for that in the town hall/respective state building suited for that [ ceremonial ] purpose . 
  this is the so called * state-sanctioned * legal contract between two persons ( marriage ) and church ceremonies are entirely non-compulsory . 
  it all depends whether the country is secular or not as in the other case ( with state religion ) , a marriage will be recognized by the state authorities only if it 's performed by a cleric . 
  if it 's not , it will be considered a civil union , which marriage has differences with . 
  for example the uk government published [ a comparison between the two ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/comparison-of-civil-partnership-and-marriage-for-same-sex-couples ) . 
  i 'm gay and i would like to have a state-sanctioned marriage one day as i myself am atheist and come from a staunchly secular family ( which traces way back to my great-great-great grandfather , who lived during the kingdom of bulgaria ) , in which the marriage photos of 90 % of my cousins ( even now in the years after communism ) look [ like this ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/a_cauple_wait_for_wedding.jpg ) . 
  same-sex unions - yas , marriages - nay . 
  the netherlands holds the title of being first . 
   what these maps do n't show is what percentage of gays come out this was addressed both in the survey and the [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2isvht/abuse_score_and_percentage_of_msm_men_who_have/cl5hq45 ) . 
  i did n't make a map , but i did took a shot of the * outness by country * data : http://imgur.com/zcuqmkn  would n't ` come out ' to a pollster making an unexpected phone call i was one of those 1 084 bulgarians , who participated in the survey . 
  it was online , anonymous and the question about outness was non-compulsory . 
  all the rest was ok and i agree with you , it 's just that the example in question that you used was n't very suitable . 
  i see . 
  thanks !, 
   [ source ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_bloc#cite_note-hardt17-192 ) this link leads to a different part of the article . 
  i think you meant to link to [ this part ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eastern_bloc#lagging_growth ) . 
  a survey among msm ( men , who have sex with men ) was conducted by the johannes gutenberg university mainz ( germany ) just recently . 
  the results will be published in may . 
  meanwhile , i can refer you to the results of a survey , conducted in 2010 . https://imgur.com/a/yexty here 's the thread link from / r/europe : http://redd.it/2isvht, 
  there was an x-post from there on / r/europe 11 days ago : http://redd.it/2ynvlr it went unnoticed though . 
   euro ~ ~ commision ~ ~ ** council ** downvote-brigading abolishment of roaming charges proposal . 
  ftfy . 
  the commission proposed it , the council of the eu [ rejected ] ( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/05/eu_plan_to_ban_roaming_charges_dropped_youll_just_have_to_pay_that_whopping_great_bill_after_your_hols/ ) it . 
  ultimately perplexed here too as we 're on par with australia and new zealand !, 
  it 's like i 'm in a different universe . 
  edit : we actually dropped 9 places from [ 2011 ] ( http://www.iccwbo.org/data/documents/global-influence/g20/products/2011-open-markets-index - ( omi ) - pdf / ) , when bulgaria scored 4.3 and was 14th . 
  -- wait !, 
  ** there is a miscalculation !, 
  ** bulgaria should be 4.2 , not 4.1 !, 
  3.4 + 4.6 + 5.3 + 3.8 = 17.1 \u00f7 4 = 4.275 also , canada 's average score should be 4.3 ( more precisely 4.325 ) , not 4.2 . 
  i wonder if there 's more miscalculations . 
  or my calculations are wrong ? 
  well , according to eurostat in 2011 it was [ 10.4 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00122&amp;plugin=1 ) and/or [ 19.6 ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdph240 ) ( depending on what they took into account , aka the latter probably includes attempted suicides ) . 
  sorry to read about your dad . 
   the dirtiest country in europe what measure did you take so as to claim that ? 
  genuinely curious . 
   my main point is that the situation in the country is bad ( and has been like that for quite some time ) and statistics like this help to show that . 
  i agree with that . 
   so even when we 're not the worst when it comes to suicide rates , there are plenty of other statistics that make up for that . 
  one statistic can not reastically overshadow or make up for another . 
  for example , the share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption ( [ 19 % ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=nrg_ind_335a&amp;lang=en ) ) has zero correlation with , say , the [ number ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=tour_dem_tnsex&amp;lang=en ) of nights spent in the country . 
  at best , they 'd be indirectly related . 
  if you fix something that is broken , that does n't mean the rest of the other broken stuff will follow suit on its own * or * the stuff that is all good ( not broken ) will break because of that . 
  bottom line is , there is plenty of work that need be done and that will take years and possibly decades . 
  * it was the [ international francophonie day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_francophonie_day ) today and since she 's our form tutor , she had to say something . 
  * ^ ^ ^ ^ channeling ^ ^ ^ ^ / u/dclauzel, 
   highest suicide rates ? 
  ~ ~ bulgaria ~ ~ [ 18 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_suicide_rate ) european countries are ahead of us in that regard . 
  if you 're gon na bitch about something , it is recommended to check the facts . 
  beside , there are plenty of stuff we 're the worst at . 
  in this one we 're not ( yet ) . 
  i 'm on mobile . . can someone tell me if we 're the most dissatisfied ? 
  i bet we are . 
  link to the interactive map : http://www.yr.no/kart/#lat=57.13001&amp;lon=6.97872&amp;zoom=4&amp;laga=nedb%c3%b8r&amp;baseid=punktutlandet%3a728193&amp;proj=900913 -- i would like to vent !, 
  it is said that the next solar eclipse will be ( visible from europe ) in 2026 . 
  naturally , nature just had to screw the balkans and it 's march 20th !, 
  it 's supposed to be some 12-18 degrees c here ( or it used to be like that at this time of the year in previous years ) , not this fucking snow that 's raining outside right now here in plovdiv . 
  / rant - over . 
  [ map of what the weather situation will be in europe at the time of the eclipse tomorrow , according to yr.no ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rvrlyto.png ) nature just had to screw us here in the balkans . 
  it 's fucking snowing right now here in plovdiv . 
  then again i do n't live in sofia , so that is a rare occasion for me . 
  i think it 's this one : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burgas%e2%80%93alexandroupoli_pipeline, 
  even so the data still seems to be flawed to me . 
  only 1 brand is over 6.00 bgn and that 's sobranie , which costs 10.00 bgn/pack . 
  davidoff 's average price is 5.30 bgn , dunhill - 5.70 bgn , marlboro - 5.10 bgn , rothmans - 4.70 bgn , camel - 4.70 bgn and etc. 
  [ list of cigarette prices/pack ] ( http://translate.google.bg/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;u=http://cigari.org/%25d0%25bc%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b8-%25d1%2586%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b3%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d0%25b8/%25d0%25bc%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b8-%25d1%2586%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b3%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d0%25b8-%25d0%25b2-%25d0%25b1%25d1%258a%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b3%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d0%25b8%25d1%258f/&amp;prev=search ) . 
  can we get the source for these prices ? 
  the average price for a cigarette pack in bulgaria is 4.70 bgn , which is 1.95 gbp ( june exchange rate 1bgn = 0.4092 gbp ) , not 6.30 bgn ( = 2.58 gbp ) . 
  surely they meant to say vulva , not vagina ? 
  or what am i missing ? 
  how does one go about putting an earring on the [ vagina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vagina ) , let alone stay there ? 
  a thorough q&a on the package here : http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_memo-15-4609_en.htm, 
   do n't call them russians sorry , but i did n't say that . 
  i said mentioning russians or russia in general should be avoided . 
  * nonetheless * , i agree - do n't call them russians as that is a serious offence . 
  i think adding * in england * in the title would 've been great . . good work nonetheless !, 
  i take it the list is not structured in largest to smallest numbers ( as % of pop . 
  ) , right ? 
  i object !, 
  http://i.imgur.com/5ciprhp.png ( thrilled as i finally get to use the photo above that i have in the bookmarks of my mozilla browser and i do n't even remember where i have it from :d ), 
   hopefully the government considers reforming the regulations ( this may come out as a snarky comment , but . . ) my sides !, 
  this government has been in office for 5 months now and the only ` reform ' they managed to do is to copy the pension model of hungary ( nationalisation of private pensions funds ) and raise the minimum wage , respectively - they 're own salaries as well . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
  reforms in the judiciary and the laws so businesses could run better , corruption - to go down ? 
  they 'd delay that until the very last moment , if ever . 
  i 'll reply to you and tag / u/brazul as you both seem to be interested as to why government *** might *** seek to ban uber : * allegedly * the taxi union here believes that uber are not abiding the rules under the laws . 
   according to the union taxi [ ... ] uber is engaged in unfair competition and its transport services do not meet the legal criteria , since there are no licenses and documents for the drivers . 
   [ ... ] anyone could easily become a uber driver . 
  there are three simple requirements - the driver must have had a driving license for at least three years , and a car with no more than 10 years on the road . 
  additionally , uber officially requests a driving record from the local road police office to reaffirm suitability . 
  [ ... ]  under bulgarian law , one has to be registered in order to offer paid transport services . 
  cars used by uber drivers can not be legally subject to the inspections that the automotive administration conducts on taxi vehicles unless there are witnesses that the given vehicle has been involved in paid transportation .
