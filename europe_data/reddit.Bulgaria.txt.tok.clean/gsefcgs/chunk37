  bottom line is they looked at every misplaced comma , every word the could find so as to accuse uber and try to push them out of the market , and in the perfect case - to get government ban uber from operating on the market .

  [ context ? 
  got it , thanks !, 
   family names are gender specific in moat cases in latvia as well . 
  i did n't know . 
  what are the differences ? / what changes and is it in the end part of surnames ? 
   there are also a lot more endings . 
  i only know this much ... 
  names and approach : * estonia - prolonged os ( oo ) , as ( aa ) or is ( ii ) are common in their names . 
  * approach : * keep questions short , do n't get distracted/too much into details when explaining something ; talk about innovations and technology ( regardless of gender ) . 
  * latvia - surnames ending with - tis , - eks , - ins , sometimes with - as or - te . 
  * approach : * they 're quite shy at first , but get talkative once you establish a common topic like education , food or alcohol . 
  avoid mentioning russians or russia - that 'd take the spiritedness ( ? ), 
  out of them and is possible they 'd turn to step 1 or even cold at some cases . 
  * lithuania - family names end differently according to the gender of the person : - us , - as for males ( some have surnames with - tis like latvians so it could get confusing ) and - ene or - aite , - ute for females . 
  * approach : * be upfront , but not invasive . 
  ask them how to pronounce the word ` bralukas ' and what it means to them . 
  last sentence from latvia stays true for lithuania as well . 
  i agree . 
  that video felt like it was 10 minutes , damn . 
  good thing he wo n't have to speak in english in the documentary , else it 'd be 60 minutes long instead of the usual 12 minutes . 
   ukrainians coming to work in poland [ inb4 ] ( http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/international/scaremongering-about-ukrainian-immigrants-to-begin-on-wednesday-2014022483935 ), 
  :d you 're not really * that * far in colour difference to be the combobraker . 
  you forgot this part :  bulgaria : 5 provinces have recognized the armenian genocide ; the provinces which recognized the genocide are plovdiv followed by burgas , ruse , stara zagora , pazardzhik . 
  the issue is mainly brought up by the far-right ( kremlin-sponsored ) ataka party only when they want to [ yet again ] provoke the ( turkish ) party movement for rights and freedoms . 
  i think it was billed in parliament like 5 times thus far . 
  which ones are those that trouble you ? 
  we will have local elections in the autumn so it 's possible . 
  do n't bet too much on it though , as it is not certain whether the current coalition in parliament will survive by then . 
  you should n't be . 
  the majority of those specific meps you see on the [ list ] ( http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-annual-report-on-human-rights-and-democracy-in-the-world-2013-and-the-eu-policy-on-the-matter-motion-8.html ) , were pro-lgbti rights from way before : http://gamanews.bg/2014/05/21/koj-podkrepya-lgbti-pravata-na-predstoyashtite-evroizbori/ emil radev is the only one that seems to have changed his view from no to yes . 
  however , i can bet barekov and stanishev would have voted against . 
   we have a big problem in our country with accepting lgbt people so this is a big step forward . 
  that is because nobody in power wants to lead the pro-rights side of the public debate on the matter . 
  even if someone were to try to do that , they 'd be shunned and shamed by you-know-who 's media empire because money . 
  additionally , here you can see how individual meps voted on the resolution : http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-annual-report-on-human-rights-and-democracy-in-the-world-2013-and-the-eu-policy-on-the-matter-motion-8.html,

  you get to have all of our `` brilliant '' politicians ( from all over the country for that matter ) in exchange for a load of tax money and a metro system , while we get to have our own unique ( maina \u2122 ) culture . 
  need i remind you it 's our 130th anniversary this year ? 
  from the article :  the interior ministers of france , germany , and austria supported the proposal , according to [ ap ] ( http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/e/eu_europe_migration?site=ap&amp;section=home&amp;template=default ) . 
  yet not all european nations are expected to be in agreement , sometimes due to its plan to distribute the refugees that are accepted from the camps . 
   `` the hungarian man is , by nature , politically incorrect . 
  that is , he has not lost his common sense , '' said viktor orban , hungary 's prime minister in february . 
  `` he does not want to see throngs of people pouring into his country from other cultures who are incapable of adapting and are a threat to public safety , to his job and to his livelihood . '', 
   the uk home secretary theresa may has also rejected the proposal , claiming that `` the idea of making it easier for legal routes to stop illegal routes is completely the wrong way . '', 
  and that is why :  the european commission will continue its deliberations on immigration , and should announce an official policy sometime this summer . 
  happy reddit birthday , gogo !, 
   is this from sofia ? 
  sofia is the only city in the country that has a tram system ( metro also ) . 
  no other city in the country does . 
  on the board of the left one , it says '' \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0435 '' , which means `` crossing '' ( the/a street ) . 
   have you ever had a relationship with someone outside of your own country ? 
  yes . 
   what are your experiences with international relationships , even if they are from a country next door ? 
  what do you mean exactly ? 
  you chat with them while they 're away and have fun when they 're around . 
   your background/gender 23/m  your partner 's ( or ex ) only one ? 
  i 'll give a range : 17-36 , all male . 
   what parents and friends thought they were cool with it . 
   any difficulties ? 
  sometimes i get lost in translation , but that 's about it . 
  i 'm laid-back . 
   amusing stories ? 
  one time i went out with an irish guy , who was so charismatic we literally circled around the centre of the city about 7-8 times . 
  walking . 
  took awhile to register in our minds . 
  :d another time i was with an italian guy , who was a choir singer with a very deep voice and as we were walking in the city park he decided he 'd start singing , so i had to stand there and listen to him sing me beyonce with his gruff voice . 
  it was amusing seeing the faces of the people walking by that ranged from one end to the other . 
  it was also very charming of him to do . 
  not a brit , but yes , it is a british slang word . . or at least i have only read/heard it said by brits . 
  i really did n't know what ` showdown ' is , so naturally i picked the first option . 
  i think it is high time the german foreign minister does a reshuffle of his team . 
  what do you mean ? 
   mi\u0161ko is diminutive version of michal drop the k and you have the bulgarian version \u041c\u0438\u0448\u043e ( misho ) . 
    my\u0161ka is a little mouse same here \u043c\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0430 [ mishka ] ( fem . ), 
  = a mouse , but the nickname of michaela is miki or mish\u00e9 , or eli . 
   sluha kinda , somewhat the same in bulgarian : \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0430 ( sl\u00faga ) = servant , but from what i [ gather ] ( http://translate.google.bg/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;u=http://www.protobulgarians.com/statii%2520za%2520prabaalgarite/slovene%2520i%2520dunav%2520-%2520protobaalgarski%2520nazvaniya.htm&amp;prev=search ) it has a link/root with the old irish word * slu\u0301ag * , which means ` army ' . 
  ninja edit : your username means ` mouse ' in bulgarian , but rather when you revert to someone , as in `` hey , mishko ! '', 
  ( and has a condescending connotation to it ) . 
  i kinda have something with stara zagora . 
  the main street there starts at the central train station and since it 's steep , once you get off the train you 're up for a very tiring walk to the centre of the city . 
  i find this very tourist-unfriendly . 
  then again i have possibly the most fun-loving acquaintances from there and their strong dialect is just icing on the cake . 
  pleven was super depressing when i visited it back in 2006 ( both ) because the panorama was closed at the time and i got my phone stolen right at the station when i arrived . 
  the centre of the city was/is nice , but that 's just 5 minutes of fascination , all the rest is just blah , unless you 're into military stuff . 
   otrok in bulgarian \u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043a is an archaic word that historically meant ` peasant that is dependant on the ( local ) feudal lord ( [ bolyar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boyar#boyars_in_bulgaria ) ) ' in feudal bulgaria . 
  however , we have the word \u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0435 ( otrotch\u00e9 ) , which is the diminutive of \u043e\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043a , to say ` newborn baby ' . 
  took me a while to realise this was in bulgarian . 
  5/10 for effort and -3 / 10 for using very small children = 2/10 would watch again .

  what does `` longest main street '' mean ? 
  in [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piotrkowska_street ) it says :  one of the longest commercial thoroughfares in europe , with a length of 4.9 km some clarifications would be great . .
