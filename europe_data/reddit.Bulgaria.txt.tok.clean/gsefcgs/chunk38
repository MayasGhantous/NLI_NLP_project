  cia 's data says albania 's result is estimated for 2014 . https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2177.html, 
  no , the makers of the map made a mistake and coloured france with the orange colour for ` thirties ' , whereas the median age there is 40.9 , which is obviously in the forties and that puts france in the red category . 
  also that the uk 's median age is 0.5 less than france 's , thus both should have the same colour .

  ooh , right !, 
  discard my first comment then !, 
  haha they seem to have printed the sq miles number for population of the netherlands . 
  the population of montenegro is also wrong http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.pop.totl/countries/me?display=graph as it 's been 615k-620k since independence , not 672k as it 's said there . 
  norway 's pop . 
  number seems to be from 2006 http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.pop.totl/countries/no?display=graph the cut ( -16.7 million ) in the population of the netherlands takes the cake though . 
  here , op , let me help you : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montenegro_and_the_euro, 
  aww , our little vienna !, 
  it seems that malta is the latest in making it illegal ( 2014 ) , but that 's not where malta is . . croatia and san marino , too . 
  but that does not make either of you a `` prostitute '' , because you were ` fooling around ' with each other , rather than you or him have multiple ` corrupt ' acts with various persons . 
  business insider basically twisted the results of the survey so as to imply that buying something for someone you like makes that someone a prostitute , which is pure bs imo . 
  i just fail to see how someone buying beer for someone they like constitutes prostitution . 
  it just does n't make sense to me . 
  exhibit a : [ median income per capita ] ( http://i.imgur.com/hbc9gsx.png ) exhibit b : [ imf gdp ppp per capita 2015 estimates ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ljupvdk.jpg ), 
  count me in . 
  seconded . 
  i want names . 
  names . 
   `` have you ever received payment for sex ? '', 
  exactly what i thought it 'd be . 
  thank you !, 
  til i 've been a prostitute in 90 % of my `` love-life '' and so did my ~ ~ partners ~ ~ colleagues . 
  lol were n't you going to slovenia the other day ? 
  aaaaand , you are correct . 
  did n't notice , thanks !, 
   it could be speculated that young gay men `` have an easier time accepting their sexuality if they do it in exchange for something , like a few beers or a recharge of their phone card . '', 
  what the hell ?!?!, 
  `` have a beer , get to know your gay-self '' . 
  i call bs on this . 
  can a swede/swedish-speaker , please , pull out the questions of this survey ? 
  something 's fishy to me here and i ca n't find it on the swedish agency for youth and civil society 's [ website ] ( http://eng.mucf.se/publikationer/kategori/english ) . 
  for some reason i ca n't open the article , is it the latin monetary union ? 
  i think he means that you ca n't call anyone that comments online , because there is no such information shared in the comment section/people 's profiles in social networks . 
  he 's probably old school . 
  he 's used to calling people on the phone to tell them to send greetings to their mother . 
   and renounce your other citizenship this is [ not ] ( http://www.parliament.bg/students/index.php?action=displays&amp;id=224 ) necessary . 
  double citizenship is allowed . 
  wiki says she was born in yambol , so she was a bulgarian national . 
  after the [ stunts ] ( http://translate.google.bg/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;u=http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25d0%2592%25d1%258a%25d0%25b7%25d1%2580%25d0%25be%25d0%25b4%25d0%25b8%25d1%2582%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bd_%25d0%25bf%25d1%2580%25d0%25be%25d1%2586%25d0%25b5%25d1%2581&amp;prev=search ) done by the commies in the 70s and 80s , turkey takes the cake in that regard . 
  to be more precise , un numbers ( [ 2013 ] ( http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimatesorigin.shtml ) ) say : destination | \u2116 of bulgarian nationals | : -------- | : -------- :| turkey | 712 013 | spain | 160 832 | united states | 72 362 | germany | 66 001 | united kingdom | 58 366 | italy | 57 794 | greece | 55 988 | canada | 18 807 | romania | 18 271 | netherlands | 18 044 | france | 17 332 | israel | 16 924 | belgium | 14 641 | austria | 14 061 | rest of the world | 77 299 | ** total ** | ** 1 378 735 ** | do keep in mind that probably about 50-70k people left in 2014 + jan-feb , 2015 , so today 's bulgarian diaspora is about 1.5 million all around the world . 
   heilige schei\u00dfe , reddit is like nsa central . 
  haha no . 
  it 's just that when i read it back then it was like 2 days old post , so it was too late to bring my question . 
   this data collection was prone to a minor percentage of error and that percentage might be a tad bit higher for certain parameters understood . 
  thanks !, 
  bad healthcare . 
  if nsi is to be trusted , [ heart diseases and tumours/cancer ] ( http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/5619/deaths-causes-and-type-settlement ) are the main causes of death in the country . 
  i remember that you once mentioned that you were among the interviewers in the 2011 census and that there were certain irregularities in the counting . 
  could you possibly elaborate what these irregularities were ? 
  lol i like how persuasive you are !, 
  good luck out there !, 
  my own personal experience says [ ** yes ** ] ( https://cdn2.blovcdn.com/bloglovin/f705461f356aa8e88b856a4b6d621522e0fedf5f/g/ahr0ccuzqsuyriuyrjquynauymxvz3nwb3quy29tjtjglu5yymv6albhlwnjjtjgvk4tu1hwa1jlruklmkzbqufbqufbq05btsuyrkdqewhgukrsckprjtjgcze2mdalmky1mg1pdgphjtjcbmfkaxphci5qcgc= ) . 
  they 're quite closed ( introvert ) and shy , but that 's a good thing 'cause once you get past the first 3 walls , you 'd have a keeper . 
  on my end , it 's something like ` fiiuuuuu ' . 
  ctrl + f bulg . .  no results [ phew ] ( http://imageserver.moviepilot.com/phew-so-let-s-talk-about-michelle-rodriguez-the-minority-hero-debate.gif?width=500&amp;height=281 ) \\ #notonthelist, 
  wait , malta and georgia will be sending songs with the same name ?!? 
   hungary : boggie - wars for nothing heh . 
  i like it . 
  has certain ring to it . 
   allied with austria you 're not far from the truth . 
  the first foreign embassy of bulgaria was [ in fact ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_bulgaria#by_country ) established in austria in 1878 right after the treaty of san stefano was signed 137 years ago . 
  slovenia best slav !, 
  ^ ^ ^ again . . 
  all aboard to our new homeland - ~ ~ gotland ~ ~ bulgarland !, 
  90 % have english as their first language ( mother tongue ) . 
  there is actually no data for isle of man nationals moving to the uk in the source of this map . 
  however , it says that 781 people moved from the isle of man to australia ( so nobody lives in the isle of man today :d ) . 
  yup , it was called `` the revival process '' . 
  [ bulgarian wiki ] ( http://translate.google.bg/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;u=http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25d0%2592%25d1%258a%25d0%25b7%25d1%2580%25d0%25be%25d0%25b4%25d0%25b8%25d1%2582%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b5%25d0%25bd_%25d0%25bf%25d1%2580%25d0%25be%25d1%2586%25d0%25b5%25d1%2581&amp;prev=search ) puts the number at 360 000 . 
  it will never be forgotten neither by ethnic bulgarians nor by ethnic turks born in bulgaria as : 1 ) on one side because commies prosecuted bulgarian turks to change their names and sent those turks , who refused to do that , to labour camps ; 2 ) on the other side because of the [ terrorist acts ] ( http://translate.google.bg/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;u=http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25d0%25a2%25d0%25b5%25d1%2580%25d0%25be%25d1%2580%25d0%25b8%25d1%2581%25d1%2582%25d0%25b8%25d1%2587%25d0%25bd%25d0%25b8_%25d0%25b0%25d0%25ba%25d1%2582%25d0%25be%25d0%25b2%25d0%25b5_%25d0%25b2_%25d0%2591%25d1%258a%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b3%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d0%25b8%25d1%258f_1984-1987&amp;prev=search ) by pro-turkish rebels . . 
  i believe this is for a period of 23 years of migration from 1990 to 2013 , as according to the [ dataset ] ( http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/estimates2/estimatesorigin.shtml ) 712 013 bulgarian nationals moved to turkey . 
  there is no way in hell 700k people moved there *** at mid-year in 2013 alone *** . 
  at least that is how i see it . 
  such amass migration for 1 year would 100 % been reported on national and international media . 
  / r/titlegore , but happy liberation day , my countrymen !, 
  this translates to ` handjob ' in bulgarian . 
  not really a contribution , but i am kinda amazed that just today i was reading the back of my cereal box and there i read it 's been made in this city & wondered what it looks like . 
  thank you , op , my day has been made !, 
  i 'm so glad that this reached romania 's media as well . 
  northern neighbours , please rest assured we are laughing together at him . 
  of course he did . 
  he can proclaim anything as he sees himself untouchable . 
  i 'm not him , but i did look around and the only thing i could find is an article about a proposed new law that limits the % of foreing workers from outside the eu to 10 % in a company . 
  i could not find any confirmation that the project-law has been approved by any institution so far . 
  i am curious to see his answer as well . 
   \u042e that is `` yu '' as in yugoslavia . 
   \u044a there is no equivalent in english , but the closest one is indeed `` u '' as in ` young ' ( iung ) . 
   \u044f that is `` ya '' as in yacht , yes . 
   \u0439 that is like `` j '' , yeah .
