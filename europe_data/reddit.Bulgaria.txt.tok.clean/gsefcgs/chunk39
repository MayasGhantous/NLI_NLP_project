  the french `` versailles '' is '' \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u0439 '' in bulgarian . 
  most prefixes in bg start with letter p or \u041f , like `` pred - '' , `` pod - '' , `` pre - '' , `` po - '' . 
  the largest number of words in any bulgarian-x dictionary are under this letter . 
  the meaning of a word can change drastically with just 1 prefix ( sometimes we have 2 , 3 or even 4 prefixes ) . 
  for example , the verb for `` hold '' is `` darzha '' ( \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430 ) , but with prefix `` pod - '' aka `` poddarzham '' it changes to `` support '' . 
  good work !, 
  that was exceptionally comprehensive . 
  online gaming forums/chats do seem to help you . 
  can you provide an example of a weird prefix or suffix you 've encountered ? 
  maybe i can be of help . 
  if you speak slowly and if it is everyday talk , we 'd understand half or more of what you say . 
  3 out of 9 is not that bad . 
  it is possible that they may not remember as most aim to be 24/7 drunk for . . reasons , i guess . 
  the one from san marino is [ worse ] ( https://youtu.be/waij1vuzjya ) , if you ask me . 
  well , words naturally change meaning over time so we have to accept it as it is . 
  you are correct . 
  indeed . 
  after the fall of communism in the country , the lev was pegged to the german mark at par from the start . 
  with the replacement of the dm by the euro , the lev 's peg effectively switched to the precise equivalent of the deutsche mark 's fixed exchange rate to the euro . 
  just a slight correction : the lev is also pegged to the euro since 1999 . 
  fixed exchange rate being $ 1.00 = 1.95583 bgn . 
  oh , come on :( i do n't do programming and i make more than that . 
  programmers make twice that amount here . 
  damn , that 's disheartening to hear about greece . . 
  ah , right . 
  :( the information i had was wrong then . 
  thank you !, 
  the minimum wage for greece in the graph posted is for those , who have a university degree , are married & have at least 1 child , right ? 
  it 's not explained in the source & and i know that the greek minimum wage varies depending on these things ( i think ) , so that is why i ask . 
  this is a repost of a repost . 
  i find it interesting comparing the comments of this thread with those [ the last time this was posted ] ( https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2edemz/richest_people_of_europe_xpost_rmapporn/ ) . 
  question is , will / u/doncuneo provide the source of the figures ? 
  i certainly doubt that . 
   and you are lucky for not reading czech internet discussions . 
  the stupidity is insane . 
  tbh , news articles ' comment section anywhere are mostly to be avoided . 
  stupid people and/or people who are unable to hold a decent discussion are everywhere , so do n't feel bad . 
  that 's disheartening . 
   to get more of the things he wants sure hope they are not things for him , though . 
  has he made any statements at all in regards to this situation ? 
  what is he seeking to get ? 
  what is a `` male oriented economy '' , though ? 
  also , what would be a `` female oriented economy '' ? 
  i 'm confused . . 
  first found this on eurostat 's twitter page : https://twitter.com/eu_eurostat/status/695164554247041024 following the link in that tweet reveals the infographic is in that article http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/young_people_-_housing_conditions but it is either too big or too small there so i exported the tweeted pic to imgur . 
  more information can be found in the above eurostat link . 
  i tried to look into this , but i got exceptionally confused the moment i somehow reached a proto-indo-iranian dictionary . 
  considering these numbers are after taxes and other contributions , i 'd say it is because we pay lower taxes than romanians . 
  because the author should have not added a % sign in the name tag of the growth section as it is in absolute numbers not a percentage . 
  you can easily spot that from luxembourg : 3,189 - 40 = 3,149, 
   13,440 ( 1,941 % ) just a note : either use comma or space when you type  3-digit long numbers and use a different sign for the decimal . 
  i read the above as one thousand % instead of one point nine four one and i got a bit confused there . 
  ok , points taken and thank you for admitting your mistakes . 
  just one more thing : try to experiment with the colours of the countries and background . 
  currently 3 out of the 6 countries are in different shades of 1 colour - red . 
  finally , you 've done a great job nonetheless !, 
  i have a few issues with this : 1 . 
  portugal is a myth 2 . 
  france is about 82 % of herself and 3 . 
  hey , lets include russia 'cause poland does not have nukes ?

  well , that one kinda works as well . 
  it is not that odd [ really ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=%d0%a9%d0%b0%d1%81%d1%82%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0+%d0%9d%d0%be%d0%b2%d0%b0+%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b0&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj4to2gt4bkahumdywkhf8kdhiq_auibygb&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=913 ) . 
  well , good luck then !, 
  which city are you based ? 
  i see you speak english and french ( peaked on your comment history ) very well . 
  that should set you up well in either sofia , plovdiv or varna , so i 'm wondering . 
  more like people bringing their conflict with some other side/country/people on the territory of bulgaria and as a result killing/injuring ( bulgarian ) civilians . 
  such as : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_burgas_bus_bombing, 
  thanks, 
  not in the case of bulgaria . 
  it will be ~ $ 0,30 within a big city , but plovdiv to sofia is $ 0,60 or something like that . 
  a letter sent within city limits or within the country ? 
  in the south-western parts \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u043e\u0439 would mean [ a loom ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loom ) . 
  source : http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?langid=en&amp;catid=1196&amp;newsid=2318&amp;furthernews=yes, 
  when and which institution passed it , please ? 
  well , when the national institutions are causing times more harm than the `` foreign '' ones and act as if they are `` untouchable '' , it is not surprising that the `` foreign '' ones are ahead in the trust section . 
  since the people feel like they can not do anything to change the situation with the national institutions , then it is also not surprising that the people would like to have `` foreign '' institutions that will hold the the national institutions accountable to some extent . 
  look , i do understand your point , but you need to take into account the other side of the situation . 
  there are two groups of representatives in here , one on part of the euro zone and one on part of the country . 
  we really do not trust the group that represents our country and that is the situation in general , not only for this matter . . 
   it does n't say `` totally positive versus totally negative '' , it says `` positive '' versus `` totally negative '' . 
  oh , if that is how we are going to play , this is what it says :  forty-eight per cent of bulgarians had a positive image of the eu , down by seven percentage points , while 17 per cent had a `` totally negative '' view of the eu , up by three percentage points . 
  and if you look at [ the results ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/index.cfm/survey/getsurveydetail/instruments/standard/surveyky/2098 ) on page 10 , you will see this : http://i.imgur.com/0ndxdp1.png therefore , the percentages mentioned in the article are indeed `` totally positive versus totally negative '' . 
   it only says that for the `` future of the eu '' , of which even then , 33 % of the population ( 1/3 is no small chunk ) says they feel `` totally negative '' about the future of the eu . 
  this is an entirely different question in the opinion polling and its results should be looked at separately than the ones for the first question . 
  that is why they are mentioned in the article in separate paragraphs . 
  also , i already said that the trend in the results of the first question is negative , so the results for the other question are not that surprising . 
  and i do agree that 33 % is no small chunk . 
   you 're changing the perimeters to suit your own pro-eu pov . 
  although , i am pro-eu , i am just showing you what the results really are , as you read them incorrectly . 
  in this case , it is is the stats geek in me that is speaking , not the political science geek . 
   after i just showed you how you 've been twisting the data and even inserting definitions where there are none ? 
  you showed me that you can makes mistakes , which is a human thing to do and that is all i will say as regards to this . 
  err , you need to look at the view of the people towards the domestic institutions as well . 
  in an opinion poll from june , 2015 , it was revealed that only 9 % of bulgarians view the bulgarian national bank positively , while 52 % hold a negative view . 
  this means that we are 5 times more likely not to trust the national institution that will represent us in such an action . 
  keep in mind this is one of the core institutions that will have to carry out the conversion from the lev to the euro .
