  you 're welcome !, 
   where the name cernavoda is coming ? 
  from [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cernavod%c4%83 ) :  the town 's name is derived from the slavic ( more precisely bulgarian ) \u010derna voda ( \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 in cyrillic ) , meaning `` black water '' . 
  this name is regarded by some scholars as a calque of the earlier thracian name ax\u00edopa , from ie * n.ksei `` dark '' and up\u0101 `` water '' ( cf. 
  avestan ax\u0161a\u0113na `` dark '' and lithuanian \u00f9p\u0117 `` river , creek '' ) . 
  i posted about this here the day it hit the news in bulgaria . 
  [ thread ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2gt8v6/picture_of_the_28_years_old_teacher_that_made_the/ ), 
  \u1566 ( \u00f2 \u203f \u00f3\u02c7 ) \u1564 absolutely !, 
  [ here 's * outness * by country ] ( http://imgur.com/zcuqmkn ) as reported in the source . 
  after i slept over it , i realized that an example of intimidation is someone showing you the middle finger . 
  it 's neither verbal , nor physical violence , it 's just intimidation . . 
  yes , sure !, 
  i 'll try and look for some data and will make a map and post it here in the sub . . 
  well , they needed something to make the scale , now did n't they ? 
   as far as i remember the questions ' answer options was a drop-down menu to choose a period , like last week , last month , last 12 months and never . 
  i do n't really remember if i had to evaluate on a scale the seriousness of what had happened . 
  i probably chose `` never '' . . do n't really remember , sorry . . 
   someone walking up and you know , threatening you that is `` stared at and verbal violence '' to me , not just intimidation . . 
  i 'd say it depends on the person . 
  some people do not care if other people stare at them and thus reject intimidation , whilst others do take stares seriously . 
  what level of abuse would you put `` intimidation '' in ? 
  it 's [ dan ** ie ** l mitov ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/daniel_mitov ) , not danail . . 
  '' * translation : `` the bulgarian government owes loyalty only to its citizens and to the national interests of its country . '', 
  nonetheless , bravo to our foreign minister !, 
  he obviously has balls and knows what diplomacy means , unlike this rogozin . 
  i hope mitov gets his mandate extended and stay in the next parliament . 
  ** edit : ** according to [ this article in bulgarian ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/sviat/2014/10/09/2396802_nato_e_bezotpadno_proizvodstvo_otgovori_rogozin_na/ ) , rogozin today [ tweeted ] ( https://twitter.com/drogozin/status/520093928906047488 ) in reply to our foreign minister 's reaction with : `` nato is indeed a zero waste industry . 
  bulgaria is utterly offended by rogozin . '', 
  rogozin is such a troll . 
  [ source ( pdf , page 175 ) ] ( http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/publications/emis-2010-european-men-who-have-sex-with-men-survey.pdf ) i decided to dust off one of my e-mail accounts today and found one e-mail that reminded me that i had participated in the european msm internet survey back in 201 ** 0 ** and informed me that the results have been published in 201 ** 3 ** . 
  in the survey , they touched issues such as sexual unhappiness , stis , migration , experience of discrimination and homophobia , etc. 
  so i decided to make collection of maps of one of the indices and chose the abuse score to put countries in comparison . 
  ** abuse score is defined as ** :  in order to have an overall measure of abuse in the last 12 months , we constructed an abuse score ranging from 0 to 7 , as follows :  * no violence in the last year : 0  * stared at or intimidated : 1  * verbal violence only : 2  * stared at and verbal violence : 3  * physical violence only : 4  * stared at and physical violence : 5  * verbal and physical violence : 6  * all three forms of violence : 7 . 
   the mean score for the overall sample was 0.98 . 
  this does not mean that there may not be msm , who suffered , for example , all three forms of abuse ( score 7 ) , but only that the average value was 0.98 . 
  all country means were lower than 2 . 
  at sub-regional level , eastern sub-regions showed the highest scores , ranging from 0.96 ( south-east non-eu ) to 1.27 ( south-east eu ) , with the only exception being west europe ( 1.16 ) . 
  if we consider the inclusion process of eu , the newer eu member states scored highest ( 1.16 ) , followed by the non-eu/efta countries ( 1.09 ) and the older eu member states ( 0.95 ) . 
  the survey results have shown the following conclusions about : * the percentage of msm , who have been ** stared at or intimated ** : * of the overall sample , a third ( 34 % ) reported having been stared at or intimidated in the last 12 months .
