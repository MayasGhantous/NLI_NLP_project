  [ source in bulgarian , page 17 ] ( http://alpharesearch.bg/userfiles/file/0615_public_opinion_alpha_research.pdf ) thus , i 'd say that our attitude towards the adoption of the euro is not due to ` muh sovereignity ' or because the euro is bad , but because we do not trust the domestic institutions for such an action . 
   your own article says that less than half of bulgarians support the eu , and that 17 % of bulgarians feel `` very negatively '' about the eu . 
  it does not say `` very negatively '' , it says `` totally negative '' view of the eu , and ` total positive ' vs. ` total negative ' is 48 % vs. 17 % . 
  this just goes to show that bulgarians are 3 times more likely to be pro-eu than anti-eu , with a negative trend . 
   less than a year ago , more than 1/5 of bulgarians wanted greater union with russia . 
  in the linked article it says 22 % of bulgarians want to join russia 's ` eurasian union ' , as opposed to what ? 
  78 % who do n't . 
   i 'm not sure if bulgaria is as pro-eu as you are . 
  / u/teheroic is on point in his comment . 
  it is you , who twisted their words in a negative spin without having a further look into the stats & opinion pollings available . 
  erm , we were speaking about sourthern europe , no ? 
  i thought you were referring to that specific area ( southern europe ) so that is why i made a comparison between the duration of the day and night at one point in time and that at another point in time for that area , but in your explanation you seem to compare many areas ( tropics to arctic circle ) and their duration of the day and night at different points in time . 
  i 'm confused . 
   days are surprisingly short in the summer when you get to the tropics this is n't surprising to me . 
  there 's [ this nice graph ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/hours_of_daylight_vs_latitude_vs_day_of_year_cmglee.svg/1280px-hours_of_daylight_vs_latitude_vs_day_of_year_cmglee.svg.png ) that explains it very well , when of course the comparison is made between two or more areas . 
   days are longer in the winter . 
  sorry , longer than what ? 
  if it is as opposed to nights , then you are mistaken . 
  days are shorter in winter and longer in summer time . 
  sofia has * supermarkets working 24/7 are not a thing in the rest of the country . 
  you joke , but one of the theories as to why we do the opposite gestures is attributing it to the ottomans . 
  when they used [ yatagans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yatagan ) , which they put on the throats of bulgarians , asking them if they accept islam , bulgarians were nodding for `` yes '' so their throat does not get cut , but the meaning of the gesture changed so although ottomans thought they are willing to be islamised ( better word , pls ? 
  ) , for bulgarians the gesture would mean the opposite . 
  thus , nodding was altered to mean `` no '' and shaking head for `` yes '' . 
  yep . 
  i live in that city . 
  can confirm it has its wonderful sites . 
  you are welcome to visit at any time . 
  shake your head to mean `` yes '' and nod for `` no '' . 
  however , we may accomodate by reversing the motions so be sure that you are clear in your answer to avoid agreeing to something you would rather refuse if/when you interact with bulgarians . 
  i 've only been to one apartment in that building ( 18th floor ) and it was quite nice ( it was renovated ) . 
  it 's kind of meant to do that . 
  funny you mentioned that . 
  i 've eaten sunflower seeds in a squat position on the terrace of the 18th floor of this building . 
  step aside y' all , as i bring you this 19-floor gloriousness : http://i.imgur.com/dh0dogk.jpg edit : [ location ] ( https://www.google.bg/maps/@42.1338666,24.7573769,3a,75y,48.66h,97.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sbjd1dt72ykfkntimcrynpg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 ), 
  kinda unrelated , but is it just me who finds psoe 's candidate for pm ridiculously good looking ? 
  false . 
  it is not ** the ** purpose , but it could be ** one of the purposes ** of those apps . 
  those apps are just social networks geared towards msm . 
  for example , gay romeo , which is now called planet romeo , has groups for anything from cooking or mechanics to bdsm just like facebook . 
   of course most of the guys in apps are looking just for sex . 
  that 's subjective and i 'll reject it until proven otherwise . 
  as for the rest of your comment , i do understand what you 're saying , but that does not barre me from hoping that people will learn from the mistakes of others . 
   promiscuous people are people who have more sex than average . 
  that does n't mean they have sex with anyone or that they 're careless when choosing their partners . 
  this is a wrong statement . 
  `` more sex than average '' can be between two people in a relationship . 
  promiscuity is exactly the act of being indiscriminate in the choice of sexual partners . 
   also using robberies as an example or a lesson is also terrible . 
  it is terrible to learn from the mistakes of other people ? 
  what ? 
  thing is that is that people start to look just for sex because the ones they have already interacted with only wanted to have sex and nothing else . 
  let me give you an example : guy : hey ( optional ) guy : [ dick or ass pic ] me : hey guy : you look cute . 
  t/b ? 
  me : i 'm not looking for sex . 
  guy : then what are you looking for ? 
  me : someone i can share the best moments of my life with . 
  someone that will make me laugh , which i will love him for . 
  how about you ? 
  guy : eh , there are no serious guys for that , you know . 
  - end - i 've had such conversations countless times and that has led me to believe in what i stated in the first sentence of this comment . 
  yes , i just used ` being trustful to complete strangers ' as a phrase of ` promiscuity ' . 
  can you elaborate on your comment , please ? 
  i struggle to understand its purpose . 
  it is a gay social network app . 
  if you use it just to seek sex partners , then that 'd be on your discretion only . 
  not everyone on there is seeking sex , including me . 
  also : https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/2n06bl/any_actual_relationships_that_came_from_grindr/, 
  as a gay guy who has met 200 + guys who were seeking to have `` just sex and nothing else '' , i can tell you that promiscuity * is * bad . 
  all of them were exceptionally lonely and were unwilling to change that precisely because a majority of other gay guys do not seek relationship . 
  it does not matter if it is the 5th or 21st century , loneliness can not be overturned by having one-night-stands . 
  i have no words for your reaction to my comment , which calls on people to be less trustful to complete strangers , / u/jpaolo . 
  i did not write that comment in bad faith , but i guess you had to twist it the other way around . 
  that is entirely what i meant with my comment . 
  i am gay and i use grindr and have met wonderful people from there . 
  however , they were the few that have not sent me a dick pic as a way to say `` hi '' . 
  the collection of dick pics that i have on my messages tab in that app is getting too long . 
  i believe i am entirely in a position to judge them . 
  for the curious : [ straight people experience the absurdity of gay conversion therapy ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6klxwaxh8a ), 
  thank you !, 
  looking forward to the results later today or tomorrow then !, 
  how much is the turnout so far ? 
  any preliminary results ? 
  ah , this explains a lot . 
  thanks !, 
  now i 'm sure the research for this map has started before 1909 . 
  aah , i see now . 
  yeah , i misunderstood you there . . 
  same is done by teachers here as well , but a bit differently . 
  they 'd either write good 3 1/2 or 3,50 . 
  never seen 4/5 or 1/5 used for 0,75 or 0,25 though . . 
  because 1 is for bad behaviour or for when the student is caught cheating . 
  i distinctly remember when i was in 5th grade one student got 1 on his test in english class because the teacher caught him trying to look up the answers on my sheet . 
  i did n't know he was trying to do that until the teacher raised her voice asking that he comes to her intermediately with his notes pad ( translation of \u0431\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0438\u043a , pls ) and his test , which he did and she wrote cheater on it and a `` bad 1 '' in his notes book . 
  err , the article is by an australian newspaper so it makes sense that they 'd use `` dollars '' in their tittle . 
  further , they talk about kroners in the text of the article and convert them in local currency in brackets , which is kind of a standard thing in journalism when talking about money spent in/by other countries . 
   instead of the usual stick man , the special lights at pedestrian crossings show two figures : either a man or a woman , two men or two women , holding hands , together with a little heart symbol  the lights were first installed temporarily in vienna for the eurovision song contest earlier this year ** but proved so popular ** that they were made permanent and spread to salzburg and to linz . 
  so what agenda are the lights `` shoving down people 's throats '' exactly ? 
  i think it is also good to post the [ statement by b92 ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=12&amp;dd=07&amp;nav_id=96280 ) , which nytimes forgot to mention . 
  i wish i did , but nope , no way to find out where my taxes went to as far as i know .
