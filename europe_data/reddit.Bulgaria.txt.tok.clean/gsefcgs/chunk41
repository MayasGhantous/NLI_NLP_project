   mario draghi , president of the ecb , is worried [ more like ] ( http://i.imgur.com/13ggjq9.png ), 
  actually she sounded tense while she was translating . 
  this is the first time i could really sense the pressure that is on a simultaneous translator . 
  it 's because of their rules of transliteration from serbian cyrillic script to serbian latin script , i.e. 
  the \u045b letter is always transliterated as \u0107 : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c4%86, 
  since you 're fren ** ch ** , it 's pronounced * vuchich * . 
  yes , i believe so . 
  i just wan na thank you guys for doing this ama !, 
  it 's been great !, 
  we 'll keep in touch . 
  haha , 
  \\ #worsethaneuaverage or \\ #asgoodasfinland \\ #rejoice ? 
  hmm . 
  what do you want edited ? 
  the ruling conclusions from 107 years ago ? 
  i know you 're joking , but you linked to an article with the following :  on january 4 , 1908 , a trial was held in minnesota about whether john svan and several other finnish immigrants would become naturalized united states citizens or not , as the process only was for `` whites '' and `` blacks '' in general , and district prosecutor john sweet was of the opinion that finnish immigrants were mongols . 
  the judge , william a. cant , later concluded that the finnish people may have been mongolian from the beginning , but that the climate they lived in for a long time , and historical finnish immigration and assimilation of germanic tribes ( teutons ) -- which he considered modern `` pure finns '' indistinguishable from -- had made ** the finnish population one of the whitest ( fairest ) people in europe . 
  if the finns had mongol ancestry , it was distant and diluted . 
  ** john svan and the others were made naturalized us citizens , and from that day on , the law forbade treating finnish immigrants and americans of finnish descent as not white . 
  [ 14 ] [ 15 ] i did chuckle a bit though . . 
  edited my comment . 
  hope that 's better . 
  ah , no worries mate . 
  took me a just a few minutes . 
  you can tell by the laziness in the headers . 
  [ uk , spain and latvia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yv7fsg0.png ) , you mean . 
  edit : [ here 's a not so lazy version ] ( http://i.imgur.com/snsxmpy.png ) . 
  oh , will do !, 
  there have been calls for an ama , so i 'll try to coordinate this with the makers and the mods . 
  that 's ok , let me refer you to [ my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t25vq/the_trailer_to_an_animation_series_based_on/cx37u60 ) . 
  let me refer you to [ my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t25vq/the_trailer_to_an_animation_series_based_on/cx37u60 ) . 
  to your first point , i 'd like to refer you to [ my comment here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3t25vq/the_trailer_to_an_animation_series_based_on/cx37u60 ) . 
   as for your second point , i also think that it 's about time we see something that explores the intricacies of other mythologies and folklores beside the greco-roman and norse stories ( not that they are bad ) . 
  nonetheless , keep in mind that since this series will address balkan mythology and folklore , it 'd make sense that some details would pertain to greek mythology and folklore . 
  for example , the golden apple is featured in greek mythology on three instances : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_apple#greek_mythology , 
   i can explain this , because they have already answered to this point in their q&a :  ** 3 . 
  are the similarities with the visual style of samurai jack intentional ? 
  **  you can almost say that was on purpose . 
  our style was inspired and is somewhat based on the style developed by the american artist [ eyvind earle ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eyvind_earle ) ( 1916-2000 ) . 
  he was the main background artist for the disney film `` sleeping beauty '' and a lot of animation productions were inspired and influenced by his work - including samurai jack and *** the golden apple *** . 
   as time progresses and as we move further into the first season of the show , the visual style will gradually change and will include more elements that are specific for the balkans and bulgaria - traditional colourings , ornaments , etc. 
  they also noted that the production team is international , meaning that the crew consists not only of bulgarians and bulgarians living abroad , but professionals from other nationalities as well ( i 've seen comments and likes on their fb page by dutch and american artists/designers ) . 
  so it makes sense that some of them might have been involved in the making of the samurai jack series as well as avatar , the last airbender , the secret of kells etc. 
  that is a good idea !, 
  i will speak with them , if they are up for one !, 
  they have not made the series yet . 
  they are in pre-production right now as they are trying to collect enough funds to make the first season ( the plan is to make 2 seasons with 24 series each with duration of 24 minutes each ) . 
  the trailer has been made so far only because kickstarter requires one as well as because they can thus show potential investors and distributors that the series will have a significant audience . 
  on the fb page they said the kickstarter campaign will be launched on monday , 23rd of nov. 
  as a long-time subscriber and contributor to this sub , i made sure the mods are aware that this is coming beforehand . 
  also , because i keep myself aware of the rules of the sub . 
   i 'd love to share it in other subs , had i known which ones would appreciate the post . . 
  completely agree with you there in that the voice acting is crucial . 
  of course , there will also be people who will have had a different view of how some of the characters should sound as each person is entitled to their own interpretation of them . 
  it is somewhat subjective , but fingers crossed they do pick decent actors . 
  they have already announced some of the main actors in the bulgarian version , but nothing much so far about the english version . 
  although , i can see that they have liked the page of carrie hope fletcher on fb , also known as [ itswaypastmybedtime ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/itswaypastmybedtime/featured ) on yt , which leads me to assume that they will try to reach her for the voice of either vihra ( the blue-haired girl ) or tina-pakostina ( the red-haired girl - the samodiva ) . 
  as i am very hyped about this project i will make sure to post an update once they start their kickstarter campaign , as well as when they announce the beginning of the series . 
  meanwhile , feel free to tell all your friends , who you think might like it . 
  completely agree !, 
  [ on their website ] ( http://goldenappleseries.com/about-the-project/ ) they have noted that :  the show will rely heavily on these exotic elements for its visual style and inner world logic . 
  however , it is also a coming of age story , set in a complicated world faced with contemporary issues such as climate change , the effects of uncontrolled industrialisation , xenophobia , social exclusion , racism and prolonged conflict . 
  so i also look forward to seeing how they will make this work . 
  there will also be a comedic spin with one of the characters - [ the sheep ] ( http://goldenappleseries.com/#tab-5 ) :  the sheep ( harry ) is the comic relief character of the series . 
  throughout the season , we will see him at random moments somewhere near our characters -- always munching away on something , always completely casual and uninterested in the events taking place in the story . 
  he often overcomes obstacles faced earlier by our characters with unparalleled cool and ease . 
  i 've been hyped about this since i heard about it a year ago . 
  i remember being the 780th like on their facebook page . 
  haha i 'm just waiting for them to make a better [ t-shirt design ] ( http://www.tricotage.bg/shop/bg/the-golden-apple-by-tga-guys-tee.html ) . . you can support them by making a donation , if you wish . 
   i 've posted the link to that in the comments of this thread . 
  the creators published a [ trailer appeal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ao14paaiwk ) video , informing that their kickstarter campagin will start in 10 days . . 
  meanwhile , if you wish to support them , feel free to donate using the donate button on the project 's website http://goldenappleseries.com/donate/, 
  feel free to share it with all friends of yours which you think might like it , 
  yes , you are correct in that it is mostly slavic mythology . 
  the makers revealed in one of the interviews that they worked with a specialist from the mythology department of the national library in sofia , where they have at least a couple hundred books on bulgarian and balkan mythology . 
  [ on their website ] ( http://goldenappleseries.com/about-the-project/ ) they have noted that :  eastern european mythology and folklore seamlessly blend influences from asian nomads , the orient , ancient greece , the thracian and the european slavic cultures , the result being something completely new and interesting , but still european . 
  the show will rely heavily on these exotic elements for its visual style and inner world logic . 
  however , it is also a coming of age story , set in a complicated world faced with contemporary issues such as climate change , the effects of uncontrolled industrialisation , xenophobia , social exclusion , racism and prolonged conflict . 
  in their q&a video , which is unfortunately available only in bulgarian ( but you can find the faq in english on the project 's facebook page ) , they said that as the series go further , viewers will see more and more details which are more inspired by bulgarian mythology in particular . 
  then again , when was the last time there was something of such high quality that was about slavic or even balkan culture and mythology ? 
  i have 2 friends that are/live in paris and they just marked themselves as being safe in the `` affected area '' on facebook ( this is new to me as i got a notification for that , but at least i know they are safe ) . 
  anyone else got something similar ? 
  i understood that, 
  well , there 's this https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0_%d0%ba%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b5%d0%ba%d1%82%d0%bd%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82, 
  neither of these photos should give you much certainty , considering that the article posted states :  vladimir putin 's elder daughter , maria , has kept out of the spotlight even more than her sister . 
  ** reuters was unable to find any recent , confirmed photographs of maria . 
  ** and that is why reuters put a picture of them both , from their childhood , taken from putin 's official website . 
   penchev , 45 , had pulled up moments earlier in his immaculate 2014 silver s-class mercedes , just shy of 12:30 p.m. , when a buzzer signaled the end of lunch . 
  ...  he tells colleagues in meetings that they 're `` idiots '' who should `` go back to kindergarten , '' and posts signs throughout headquarters exhorting employees to work like * kucheta * , which is bulgarian for `` dogs . '' ...  penchev describes himself as a serial entrepreneur driven by anxiety and a desire to overcompensate for reasons both physical -- he stands just shy of 5 feet 7 inches -- and cultural . 
  `` bulgaria was ruled by the ottoman empire for 500 years , '' he says . 
  `` we were deprived of most of our rights , so we lived like slaves . 
  so this is not in our genes but in part of our culture : to accept being inferior . '' ...  in letnitsa , `` people are exhausted , the factory never stops . 
  we work at full capacity all the time , '' he says . 
  `` but these are good problems . 
  i do not complain . '' an explicit example of what the average bulgarian employer is/wants to be . 
  i love how there are at least 2 posts per month there .

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i_with_grave_%28cyrillic%29#serbian  ** serbian **  \u27e8 \u040d \u27e9 ( as well as other vowels with acute , grave , circumflex , or double grave accents ) can be optionally used in serbian texts to show one of four possible tones of the stressed syllable . 
  in cases like \u043f\u0440\u045d\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0438 ( ` to gather ' ) vs. \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0443\u0301\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0438 ( ` to purchase more ' ) , or \u045d\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043f ( ` redemption ' ` ransom ' ) vs. \u0438\u030f\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043f ( ` meeting ' ) ; the usage of diacritics can also prevent ambiguity .
