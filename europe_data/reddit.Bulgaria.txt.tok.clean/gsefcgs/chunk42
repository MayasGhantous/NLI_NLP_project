  in the latin variant of the serbo-croatian writing system ( the so-called gajevica ) , all stress/tone marks are the same , i.e. 
  cyrillic \u27e8 \u040d \u27e9 corresponds to latin \u27e8 \u00ec \u27e9 etc. 
  \u0419 is not used in serbian cyrillic , that i agree with . 
  the map seems to focus on latin script only as greece and georgia are omitted as well , i guess . . 
  if \u045d and \u0439 in bulgarian , serbian cyrillic and macedonian , \u045e in belarusian , \u0491 in ukrainian and belarusian , \u0453 , \u045f ( italics ) and \u045c in macedonian as well as a bunch of letters in [ kalmyk ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kalmyk_oirat ) , ( caucasus ) russia , in [ gagauz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauz_language ) , moldova and in [ abkhaz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abkhaz_language ) ( disputed , georgia/russia ) are not diacritical , then what are they ? 
  good catch !, 
  ispanski also seems to exist , but the most common surnames of sephardic jews who fled the iberian peninsula to the territories of today 's bulgaria are baruch/baruh or behar ( [ b\u00e9jar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b%c3%a9jar ) ) . 
  i once met a guy whose surname was leonov , but it may not specifically refer to [ le\u00f3n ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/le%c3%b3n,_spain ) . . edit : found this full list of jewish surnames in bulgaria ( and the balkans ) , but it 's in bulgarian http://www.thebulgarianjews.org.il/_uploads/dbsattachedfiles/imena.pdf, 
  well , here you go : * karakachanov / - a - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarakatsani * gagauzov / - a - obvious , i guess https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gagauz_people * arabov / - a - obvious , i guess * vlahov / - a , vlashki / - a - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vlachs * g\u0103rkov / - a , g\u0103rchev / - a , possibly gurkov / - a as well - greek * kazakov / - a - kazakh * kumanov / - a - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cumans * mavrov / - a , mavrodiev / - a - well , this one is more race-related as it comes from [ \u03bc\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf ] ( https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ce%9c%ce%b1%cf%8d%cf%81%ce%bf ) ( mavro ) in greek and means `` black '' * moskov / - a - from moscow * parizhev / - a - from paris * nemtsov / - a - german * tatarchev / - a - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatars * madzharov / - a - hungarian a bit of a til for me : * arnaudov / - a , arnautov / - a - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnaud_river , but actually the surname comes from https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/arnavutlar i.e. 
  from england, 
   rapaciousness all due respect , but i do n't think this is the word you meant to use there . 
  `` rape perpetration '' fits what you most likely meant to write there . 
  here 's my comment regarding the breweries displayed on my country : * i have never heard of the beers `` sofia '' and `` pri kmeta '' ( google suggests this is a beer house , not a brewery ) . 
  `` pivzavod b'ilbor '' yields no results in google search . 
  * `` plevensko '' is more of a warehouse ( employs ~ 20 people ) , `` kamenitza '' is soon to move from plovdiv to haskovo , where `` astika '' already is - all three of those are owned by the u.s. and canadian-based [ molson coors ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molson_coors_brewing_company ) . 
  * `` pirinsko '' and `` shumensko '' ( not on the map , but it 's widely known in the country ) are both owned by danish-based [ carlsberg ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/karlsberg_bulgaria_ad ) . 
  * `` stolichno '' ( supposedly the `` sofia '' one on the map as it means `` one from the capital city '' ) and `` zagorka '' , which is misspelled as zagora on the map is owned by dutch-based heineken . 
  * `` lomsko '' and `` ledenika '' ( owned by [ bolyarka ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bolyarka ) ) are the only two breweries , which are still owned by bulgarian-based companies . 
  according to the [ source ] ( http://www.ef.com/epi/ ) of the article posted , argentina is on the same level as portugal and romania in the high proficiency group though . 
  croatia is missing as well . 
  which season would that be ? 
  i 've watched all episodes out there and i do n't remember a scene like that . . 
  i see where you are coming from . 
  i used ` mental issues ' due to the information provided in the article that :  it was that back in syria , they did n't spend this much time together . 
  he 'd had a job to go to , friends to see . 
   here , in germany , he has nothing to do , nowhere to be , no one who knows him . 
  she thought the anonymity of this place emboldened him : four thousand people , many from other countries , lived at patrick henry village , a former u.s. military base in southwestern germany that 's now a refugee camp . 
  among these strangers , her husband started drinking . 
  he started smoking weed . 
  and all day long , he was by her side , unless he wanted to be somewhere else , like a friend 's room , flirting with other women . 
  even when he was away from her , he was messaging her on whatsapp , making sure he knew where she was . 
  based on this , it is possible that he may have developed either one of the types of adhd or [ sud ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/substance_use_disorder ) , or it could be something else . 
  but , we ca n't know for certain until a professional starts working on the case , which may/should be facilitated by the local/state government . 
  i think everyone would agree that the husband needs some counselling as regards his obvious mental issues . 
  but , i do n't think the author points the finger specifically to europe , but rather to the local government as they even state that :  germany 's laws on refugee accommodation are a national adaptation of an eu statute from 2003 , according to the ministry of the interior . 
  that statute was updated by the eu in 2013 to include its only references to gender protections : `` member states shall take appropriate measures to prevent assault and gender-based violence , including sexual assault and harassment , within ... accommodation centres . ''  germany changed its national law to reflect this update this july , two years after the eu regulation was changed . 
  a spokesman for the ministry of the interior said the new law ca n't be implemented until the council of governors agrees on implementation procedures , because the day-to-day workings of refugee camps are up to state and local governments . 
  last sentence being the most important one . 
  if the local/state government stays idle in such cases , then who is to blame for the continuity of the abuse even after a complaint was to be deposited by the victim ? 
  beside that , can any german here confirm that the implementation of the above mentioned rules lies on the shoulders of the council of the governors , please ? 
  more like they do n't have any ids , at least not in the sense we have about them in [ the majority of the rest of continent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/national_identity_cards_in_the_european_economic_area#identification_document ) . 
  the sacred identifiers in uk are first and last name , date of birth , address and eventually ni ( national insurance ) number . 
  i say ni number eventually , because it is only to be revealed to the hr department of your work , [ department for work and pensions and hm revenue & customs ( hmrc ) ] ( https://www.rcs.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/applying-for-a-national-insurance-number.pdf ) . 
  thank you !, 
  can you edit the album so users would not have to switch tabs to view the translations , please ? 
  it will be much easier to read them in the description of each pic . 
  what exactly is linkis.com ? 
  i am fairly sure this post qualifies under  original news content on blogs is fine , but the largely copy-pasted stuff from earlier articles with a short line or paragraph of commentary is not . 
  this post is literally a photo with 1 sentence and a link to breitbart dot com . 
  op , why not link to the original story ? 
  can you translate the slogans in each pic , please ? 
  as of right now i can only say i like the last one , because the message is very welcoming and because i can understand it . 
  it is possible that i will like one of the previous ones more , if i know what message they are trying to convey . 
  even so , it bears no relevance to a graph showing prices of a different type of dwelling in other countries . 
  it does n't to me , tbh . 
  have all victims been identified already ? 
  * answer `` no '' : there is the possibility that bulgarians could have been at the club . 
  ( young ) people from ruse do go to bucharest to have fun since it is closer than , say varna . 
  it wo n't be good for plevneliev to keep quiet until it is revealed that there have been bulgarians who were wounded/died there , therefore the speech above . 
  * answer `` yes '' : if there were no bulgarians at the incident , plevneliev expresses deep grief in spite of that for the continuation of the good relations between the two nations . 
  it 's very simple . 
  at least that is how i see it . 
   bulgaria : average price of an apartment and not the average price of a house  bulgaria [ ... ] : estimates why include the country at all ? 
  well , if we take the current rate of climate change , we 'd be claimed by the black sea by then . 
  so , umm , yeah , you 're right . 
  and if the fertility and mortality rates remain the same as today , by 2100 the country 's population will be 1 938 808 . 
  [ source ] ( http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/dvd/ ) ( click the total population - both sexes . xls file , choose sheet ` no change ' ), 
  i assumed the second part ( 285 vs. 281 ) is on the report from 12 march 2014 , not today 's . 
  i could n't find the vote from 2014 on votewatch.eu so that led me to this assumption . 
  also it said that they voted today because of the lack of action by the eu institutions since the 2014 vote . 
  yup . . 
  they have ignored the countries/people on 3 out of the 4 peninsulas in europe . 
  even if you average out the number of internet users from the missing european countries to 50 % , you get about 130 million netizens . . 
  no worries , mate . 
  it seems to have been a left vs. right leaning groups , s&d vs. epp in particular . 
  it even says that the majority has been formed by centre ( alde ) and centre-left ( s&d , gue-ngl , greens/efa ) groups . 
  meps votes seem to have split exactly or close to 50/50 in several member states , more specifically the ones from bulgaria , croatia , cyprus , czech republic , hungary , latvia , malta , the netherlands and romania . 
  here you go http://www.votewatch.eu/en/term8-follow-up-to-the-european-parliament-resolution-of-12-march-2014-on-the-electronic-mass-surveillance-25.html, 
  really ? 
  a third of europe is ignored ?!, 
  also , this  the analysts for the reports on angola , bahrain , belarus , ecuador , egypt , ethiopia , the gambia , russia , rwanda , saudi arabia , thailand , tunisia , turkey , united arab emirates , vietnam and zimbabwe are independent internet researchers who have requested to remain anonymous . 
  is pretty much understandable . 
  every map is precious !, 
  \\ ^_^ i have not finished it yet , so it remains to be seen if there are areas where the no vote won/was close to winning . 
  aah , forgot that one . 
  thanks !, 
  i made one for the 2011 local elections , but decided not to post it yet as i 'm waiting for this years ' second round results so i can make a comparison . 
  i 'm currently working on one on the results of the referendum . 
  i guess that leaves the bordeaux colour for pf ( far right ) or is it something else ? 
  well , yeah , that 's just , like , your opinion , man . . 
  i do n't read into it , tbh . 
  i use it as a collectivity of news sources in english whenever i need to find a story or something pertaining to the refugee crisis , rather than a news agency or something like that . 
  to me the site basically reposts news rather than report on them . 
  no worries , mate . 
  this site collects all stories since the beginning of the refugees crisis here , you can use it for future reference , it 's great : http://bulgaria.bordermonitoring.eu/, 
  your memory serves you right . 
  [ * the cabinet , at its october 16 meeting [ 2013 ] , had decided to build a 30km-long barrier fence on the border with elhovo in the areas where it was easiest for illegal migrants to cross into bulgaria from turkey . 
  * ] ( http://www.sofiaglobe.com/2013/10/16/bulgarias-cabinet-to-hold-special-meeting-on-refugee-issue/ ) exactly 2 years ago , on october 24 , 2013 , [ the bulgarian army started building the fence at the border with turkey . 
  ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/154891/bulgarian+army+builds+border+fence+with+turkey ), 
  those are their numbers on the ballot paper ( s ) , which voters are called upon by the poster to cross out in the sunday election .
