  one number for mayor of municipality , one number for mayor of a settlement with 40 < permanent residents and one number for the preferential vote . 
  the first two are usually the same , but they are on separate ballot papers . 
   she speaks firmly and clearly supposedly this is how everyone whose native language is/who has learned bulgarian should speak -- as close as textbook bulgarian as possible . 
  it 's [ here ] ( https://www.google.bg/maps/place/3525+%d0%93%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%86%d0%b0/@43.3300285,22.9363342,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4754d2e60bf3e311:0xa00a014cd0de9d0 ) , in the north-west . 
  the village is about 20-25km from the serbian border . 
  however , she does n't speak in a heavy accent , rather very clearly i 'd say . 
  yep , i do n't know how op missed the opportunity to add her . 
  [ in this video ] ( http://vbox7.com/play:b0126d6f8d ) she explains that this has been her hairdo for 45 years . 
  effin ' finally !, 
  i missed on the 30k one , but i 'm not missing this one !!, 
  i think it 'd be great if a sticky post is made . 
  if i did n't come to this thread i would n't have known . 
  also , it 'd be fair to the swiss since we have had such posts for almost all elections held this year so far . 
   if you have a valid residence permit from one of those schengen countries , it is equivalent to a visa http://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/entry-exit/non-eu-nationals/index_en.htm just flash your residence permit + plane tickets when asked for travel documents and you should be fine . 
  edit : here 's an idea . 
  when you arrive at the paris airport , line up at the eu passengers queue and when asked for docs , present your residence permit card . 
  if they send you to the non-eu crowd , politely apologise for the confusion and line up at the non-eu queue . 
  if they do accept your permit without asking for passport , feel free to book your return flight as the travel documents check would be the same . 
  thank you, 
  if you 're going to use a 158-page pdf file as a source , please note from which page are your numbers . 
  also , i would have made a map , but you left bulgaria out of your list . 
  you just need more experience to find out how to balance when you squat . 
  trust me on this . 
  `` arrival '' and `` departure '' do n't fit right as well , so would n't `` going up '' and `` coming down '' be better in that case or it 's too long in swedish to be displayed ? 
  forgive me for i do n't speak swedish , but does it really say `` not up '' ? 
  why is that ? 
  except for these :  tumours , aids , multiple sclerosis and child epilepsy have they released a list of diseases , whose prescribed treatment can include medical marijuana ?

  probably by end of this month or at the beginning of november . 
  hmm . . on this day in 927 , according to [ bulgarian wiki ] ( https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9f%d0%b5%d1%82%d1%8a%d1%80_i_%28%d0%91%d1%8a%d0%bb%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f%29 ) tsar peter i married princess [ irene lekapene ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irene_lekapene ) of byzantium .

  i read recently that the uk will be taking on a new approach as regards the way they 'll pick their representative for the 2016 edition . 
  also , there will be snippets of the `` big 5 `` s songs during the semi-finals to kinda introduce their songs to the audience at the same time as the other country-representative songs/singers . 
  so they might stand a better chance next year . 
  yup , we have those as well . 
  they are also split on formal and informal basis . . like :  \u0411\u044f\u0445\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 ?

  i 'm trying to make out if we have the same stuff in bulgarian , but i 'm unsure as to what it means to you . . 
  are n't the tenses in serbo-croatian 9 ? 
  in bulgarian , they are . 
  i thought it 's the same , just like greek . 
  these are the tenses in the bulgarian language : 1 . 
  present tense 2 . 
  past defined ( aorist ) tense 3 . 
  past imperfect ( unaorist ?? ), 
  tense 4 . 
  past undefined tense 5 . 
  future tense 7 . 
  future predefined tense 8 . 
  future tense in the past 9 . 
  future predefined tense in the past, 
  they 're out there , you just might not remember passing by them because they/you were minding their/your own business . 
  also , not all black people are very dark skinned , so you might have passed by such that are black , but light skinned and you just may have not noticed them . . 
  he just gave a short interview on another tv channel ( btv ) and this is what i could gather from it : * he said he took some kind of amphetamines . 
  * `` i was out of my skin there - a completely different person ! '', 
  and continued to say `` i 'm ashamed that i took that drug and i 'm even more ashamed that my family will see what i did there '' . 
  urgh , they need to work on those resources . .  / 9 . 
  ahmed iii ( politician ) was born in constanta , bulgaria in 1673 ...  bulgaria  1673 seriously ?

  my comment was related to what stormninjag said in the brackets . 
  i agree with his point that the listed cities are mostly in the western parts of europe . 
  just clarifying . . 
  actually , vienna seems to be the easternmost city out of all cities listed there . 
  stockholm is also geographically more to the east than prague . . 
  this is true . 
  belgian televoters also gave the polish entry 12 points . 
  just checked it on the eurovision app .
