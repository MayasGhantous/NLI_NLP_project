  it makes sense now . 
  sorry , i misread your comment there . 
  my aplogies !, 
  croatia and montenegro are learning italian as a 2nd language , not turkish , according to the map you posted . 
  turkish is not even on there . 
  that 's fine though as it is confusing at first because they used the same colour , but you have to take note of what the text next to the colours there says as well . 
  just a year ago / r/europe liked the [ trailer of the `` golden apple '' series ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rehr1p6asjm ) so much , its creators were invited to and held [ an ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3v19dv/we_are_dimitar_and_elena_from_studio_zmei_the/ ) on here , which [ was officially vetted ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3uwe2y/ama_with_studio_zmei_the_creators_of_the_golden/ ) by / r/europe 's mods . 
  back then studio zmei ( the creators ) had their [ kickstarter campaign ] ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/goldenapple/the-golden-apple-series/updates ) launched , which turned to be a success so far as to allow them to create the animated short film above . 
  this is the fruit of the support / r/europe and many other people around the world gave to studio zmei . 
  enjoy !, 
  and if you would like to see more of their work or where the `` golden apple '' series is at the moment , please feel free to visit https://goldenappleseries.com/ . 
  you will also be able to support them there as they have just launched their online shop !, 
  lastly , please do not hesitate to share this animated short with any anime/animations lover you know !, 
  bulgaria once again rules on having ` do n't know ' answers . 
  swear i need to email eurostat to check up on the ways the bulgarian branch is collecting data . 
  literally 31 % did not know how to answer the question whether transgender people should have their id reflect their inner identity . 
  a simple yes/no question . 
  that 's a 3rd of surveyors not answering that question , which definitely seems shady to me . 
  well , i was hoping it would be something like 20-26 \u2103 instead it 's been 12-22 \u2103 most of the time & anything below 17 \u2103 is cold to me . 
  i 'll be back to those tropical temps soon anyways , but thank you for your time, 
  sorry for the late response . 
  i prefer it too should there be a mild breeze , not effin cold wind . 
  for me the weather right now can be classified as autumn weather like in late sept or early october . 
  i was not ready for such a weather in the days of early august, 
  currently in amsterdam and people are saying this august seems to be colder than usual . 
  and i did not even bring a damn jacket meanwhile at home i 'm told it 's scorching hot . 
  wtf, 
  just wanted to say about 2.5 years ago i found reddit through a thread with a similar name on this very sub in a google search . 
  the sub barely had 35k subscribers , but look at us both now . 
  thanks guys !, 
  is there a way to actually check this ? 
  like an achievements ' page for the number of subscribers reached at some point ? 
  just curious . 
  finland , estonia , latvia , lithuania , ukraine , moldova , romania , bulgaria , greece , turkey , and cyprus , post photos or videos from the celebrations !, 
  here 's a [ photo from plovdiv ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pnmxgl2.jpg ) !, 
  local elections + referendum on e-voting are held today in bulgaria . 
  thought it 'd be good to have a thread about that here . 
  official site of the central electoral commission / cec / ( unfortunately , it is only in bulgarian ) : https://www.cik.bg/ feel free to contribute with your own explanations/stories/sources as regards the vote & referendum today . 
  -- ## updates : ** @ 7p . m. 
  : ** [ alpha research ] ( http://alpharesearch.bg/en.html ) agency has exit polls showing this : http://i.imgur.com/qljjdrf.png [ source in bulgarian ] ( http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2015/10/25/2636065_alfa_risurch_fandukova_pecheli_sofiia_s_60_v_plovdiv_-/ ) - @ 6:48 p.m. 
  voting activity has reached 46.5 % for the local elections and 35.3 % for the referendum . 
  - from 9:30 in the morning onwards hackers * allegedly from abroad * have tried to hack the websites of the cec , the ministry of the interior , the civil register and administrative service / cras in english or grao in bulgarian / and the ministry of foreign affairs . 
  it 's been found to be a dos attack . 
  [ source in bulgarian ] ( http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/bulgaria/mestni_izbori2015/2015/10/25/2636035_masirana_hakerska_ataka_sreshtu_durjavni_saitove_v/ ) - @ 3:30 p.m. 
  the voting threshold for the referendum has been passed - 20.5 % . 
  this means that the proposal , subject to the question in the referendum will be going to parliament . 
  -- here 's some key questions and their answers ( as translated by me from [ this article ] ( http://www.capital.bg/politika_i_ikonomika/bulgaria/2015/10/21/2632664_kak_da_glasuvame_na_mestnite_izbori_i_referenduma_v/ ) ) : ** how many ballot papers will be used for the vote ? 
  ** there will be 3 to 5 ballot papers at the voting stations . 
  the villages around the capital city sofia with more than 100 residents will be the ones who would have 5 ballot papers : - for mayor of the village , - for mayor of the respective district/region of the capital , - for mayor of sofia , - for city council members in the capital city council and - for the referendum . 
  ** how will the council members be voted in ? 
  ** for the first time in local elections voters will have the right to preferential vote in the list of city council members . 
  on the ballot paper voters will have to cross out the name of the party , for which they have decided to vote for , in the square to the left of the party name , and if they have a preference for a specific city council member , voters can cross out that candidate 's number in the circles to the right . 
  the names of the candidates for city council members will not be present on the ballot papers , so in order to vote for somebody , the voter would have to know their number beforehand . 
  voters have the right to cast only one preferential vote , i.e. 
  they can cross out only one of the numbers in circles on the city council ballot paper . 
  ** how will the preferential vote be counted ? 
  ** the so called municipal electoral quota ( meq ) or the votes , which a party needs to receive in order for a candidate of theirs to be chosen as a city council member , serves as a basis for the count of the preferential votes . 
  each municipality has a different quota as it depends on the number of eligible voters as well as on the electoral activity on the day of the vote . 
  the meq is calculated by dividing the number of actual votes , cast in the respective municipality , with the number of city council members . 
  7 % of this result are needed for the rearrangement of the list of city council members . 
  for example , on the previous local elections in sofia the actual votes were 460 950 . 
  the votes needed for the a city council member to be elected in office were 7 557 . 
  this means that for the rearrangement of the list of municipal council members 529 preferential votes would be needed . 
  another example : the municipality of karlovo had 23 753 actual votes while the meq was 720 votes . 
  if this result happens today , in order for the list of municipal council members to be rearranged , 102 preferential votes would be needed . 
  in the smaller municipalities , the number of preferential votes needed for the rearrangement of the list is exceptionally smaller . 
  it is harder to replace the leader of the list of council members through preferential votes because all ballot papers , which do not have a preferential vote , are counted for the first candidate in the list . 
  in practice the fight would be for the second and third place in the list . 
  ** how to vote and when would a ballot paper be deemed invalid ? 
  ** voters would have to either use \u2713 or x in the squares or circles on the ballot papers they are given . 
  any symbols , marks or other signs left on the ballot paper would make it invalid . 
  if the ballot paper for municipal council members has the party name crossed out and the circles of the preferential votes are not marked , the ballot paper is valid . 
  if there is a preferential vote marked , but no party has been crossed out , the ballot paper is deemed invalid . 
  ** will there be machine voting ? 
  ** yes , 50 voting stations in sofia will have machines to vote on . 
  they were available in the previous local elections , but this time the votes cast on them will be taken into account . 
  ** what would the question for the referendum be ? 
  ** `` do you support the possibility to vote electronically on elections and referendums ? '' ** who will be able to participate in the referendum today ? 
  ** 6 885 893 bulgaria residents/passport holders are eligible to participate in the referendum today , including those who are abroad . 
  there will be 312 voting stations opened in 45 countries . 
  most of the stations will be located ( as per tradition ) in the united states , spain and germany . 
  ** in which case would the referendum be valid ? 
  ** the proposal subject of the referendum will be adopted if it gathered more votes than the last parliamentary elections and if the `` yes '' crowd holds the majority in the results . 
  in the last parliamentary elections 3 500 585 people participated . 
  if the participants in the referendum are less than the number of participants in the last elections , but more than 20 % of all eligible voters participated and if more than 50 % of them have voted yes , then the proposal will be sent for review by parliament.the decision will be announced in a 3-month period . 
  ** when will the polls be closed ? 
  ** voting ends at 7p . m. 
  eet , but if there are still voters waiting at the voting stations , the polls ' closing time may be extended . 
  -- results will be announced little by little by cik once the voting day ends and the count of the votes starts . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rehr1p6asjm the series ' goal is to show the positive sides of the balkans to the world . 
  the makers have hinted that they will likely make a movie and a video game based on/inspired by the series afterwards ( depending on the success of the series ) . 
  the series will be voiced in bulgarian and in english . 
  so , how do you find it , / r/europe ? 
  does it look good or bad ? 
  does it have good potential to reach kids and adults all over the world ? 
  further information about the project and the characters you saw in the trailer can be found on their website : http://goldenappleseries.com/,
