  * * the percentage of msm , who have been ** verbally insulted ** : * over a quarter ( 27 % ) of msm in the total sample had been insulted in the last 12 months . 
  * * the percentage of msm , who have been ** punched , hit , kicked or beaten ** : * overall , one in 40 ( 2.5 % ) had been physically abused because of his sexuality in the last 12 months . 
  * the survey results document also includes some maps of other indices . 
  however , the quality is not that great . 
  i did not do these maps purely for my pleasure to see what portion of msm have suffered violence and abuse in europe . 
  i did it , because there is hardly any reliable data with sufficient sample size regarding this issue , specifically for msm . 
  nonetheless , i advise you to look at the data for a few of the countries with a grain of salt , because the respondents are not enough to form a good representative sample . 
  also , please , note that over the last 3 years since 2010 things have changed ( law-wise at least ) in some of the countries , so if and ever another survey of this kind pops up , we will be able to see the actual difference made . 
  for those interested about this topic , the european agency for human rights 's [ latest lgbt survey ] ( http://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/data-and-maps/survey-data-explorer-lgbt-survey-2012 ) also covers it , but their survey is about the lgbti people in the eu countries only . 
  if there are any subreddits that might appreciate an x-post , please , notify me by sending me a message . 
  or i could 've just googled the correct writing . 
   thank you for the advice , but i 'm on win 7 . . 
  i have to admit that i might have memorized it this way , so it sounds more exotic . 
  :d do n't mind me , please !, 
   is it more expensive than london/paris ? 
  according to [ this ] ( http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/oslo/london ) the cost of living in london is about the same as in oslo , [ whereas ] ( http://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/oslo/paris ) the cost of living in paris is 22 % cheaper than in oslo . 
  there is also [ this ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=united+kingdom&amp;country2=norway&amp;city1=london&amp;city2=oslo ) and [ this ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=france&amp;country2=norway&amp;city1=paris&amp;city2=oslo ) , which give a more detailed comparisons . 
  naah , just my own observations . . do n't quote me on them . 
   \u0219 = sh = ** \u0448 ** bow before my cyrillic , you vampire !! 1 !, 
  :d / s you know i could n't possibly type that kind of `` s '' , so thank you for pointing out the correct writing of the word !, 
  i ca n't say i am 100 % sure as i do n't speak either one , but i do remember that it was n't an `` e '' [ \u00e9 ] , more like an `` i '' , so that is why i wrote it like that . 
  the person , who helped me with the pronunciation , was protuguese and certainly not brazilian ( he ensured me ) , and i actually asked him to tell me how to say `` old town '' and he said `` sidaji velia '' ( cidade velha ) . 
  sorry if i offended you . . :( not my intention !, 
  bulgarian one is about the arrival of john travolta and robert de niro to shoot movie scenes in sofia . . 
  yeah , i noticed the same when i was in lisbon earlier this year . 
  they have lots of `` j '' [ zh ] and `` sh '' sounds ( romanians pronounce it the same and have it almost equally as mush as the portuguese ) . 
  for example , `` cidade '' is `` city '' and it 's pronounced `` sida ** j ** i '' ; coincidentally `` city '' in romanian is `` oras '' , pronounced `` orash '' . 
   top 3 of commissionners  ...  \u2116 3 kristalina georgieva  scored 9 / vp for budget , human resources proud moment right there . 
  `` win '' . . 
  i do the same , too !, 
  not in last place !, 
  thanks , romania !, 
  i think it should be [ like this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/pchnxba.png ) , to follow the blue-black-white colouring of their current flag . 
  ^ i ^ hate ^ when ^ bulgarian ^ names ^ are ^ literally ^ translated ^ in ^ english , ^ so ^ i ^ had ^ to ^ edit ^ the ^ title , ^ sorry . . [ here 's a picture of the statue of tsar samuil that will be erected in sofia ] ( http://imgur.com/zihxqub ) ( sorry for the shitty quality ) . 
  on 6th of october , 1014 c.e. , tsar samuil of bulgaria [ died of a heart attack ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samuel_of_bulgaria#disaster_at_kleidion ) at the site of his blinded soldiers , who came to him guided by one of every 100 men left one-eyed by the then emperor of byzantium basil ii . 
  tsar samuil is both a heroic and a tragic figure in bulgarian history and that is why a statue will be erected in sofia ( his birthplace ) . 
  another reason for that is also because [ the `` macedonians '' are pulling an `` alexander the great 2.0 '' on bulgaria ] ( https://translate.google.ro/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=mk&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https%3a%2f%2fmk.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2f%25d0%25a6%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580_%25d0%25a1%25d0%25b0%25d0%25bc%25d0%25be%25d0%25b8%25d0%25bb&amp;sandbox=1 ) by calling him a `` macedonian king '' and `` king of the medieval macedonian empire '' . 
  beside a monument in sofia , another counter-activity against the `` macedonian '' action is the [ possible renaming of blagoevgrad to samuilgrad or city of tsar samuil ] ( https://translate.google.ro/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.monitor.bg%2farticle%3fid%3d441150&amp;sandbox=1 ) . 
  leaves you to wonder if it ever gets boring on the balkans . . 
  right ? 
  to expand on our case , [ rumiana jeleva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rumiana_jeleva ) also wanted to be a commissioner for the energy policies , but got appointed for commissioner for international cooperation , humanitarian aid and crisis response . 
  it was inevitable that she would fail miserably in the ep hearing , because her incompetence laid on the fact that she was not flexible and that 's crucial for such a high and responsible job as a european commissioner . 
  kristalina georgieva came after that failure of an mp and took the job & i 'd say she is one of the very few politicians that bulgaria is proud of . 
  ( although , we are yet to see how she will do as commissioner for budget and human resources ) so , slovenians , do n't worry . 
  as / u/zaggybg said , sooner or later justice * will * be served . 
  [ here 's a link to all videos ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/ep-live/en/committees/search?start-date=&amp;end-date=&amp;start=10 ) of the hearings . 
  most recent ones include the hearing of alenka bratu\u0161ek . 
  i do not know why , but they crop every ep hearing in 3-4 videos , which is super unnecessary for the public . 
  i downloaded the videos of kristalina georgieva 's hearing , because i do n't have the necessary wmp plug-in , and i found it * way * more easier to switch from one video to the other by having them saved on my pc than to watch/hear her whole hearing on the website of the ep . 
   a lot of kids were there . 
  some of there highly scientific and though provoking questions : how do you poop in space ? 
  how do you pee in space ? 
  what do you do if you puke in space ? 
  i would like to know the answers , please !, 
  the cec announced the official end of the election day at 20:00 so i had to change the quote . 
   `` estimated price of oranges and tomatoes at 15 o'clock '' at least media was somewhat entertaining , ours was/is rushing down to not tell who they caught buying votes and which parties are doing it . 
  the circus is full on and i ca n't tell if i should laugh or cry . .

  done that . 
  but i 'm not saying that i love you . 
  thank you !, 
  op , where did you take the forecasts from ? 
  gallup , alfa research etc. ? 
  also , what do you mean by ` the attack started using far-left rhetoric ' ? 
  have i missed something ?

  hey , there !, 
  welcome to politics of bulgaria . 
  please , have a seat and watch the circus * . 
  ^ ^ * no ^ ^ guarantee ^ ^ it ^ ^ will ^ ^ be ^ ^ amusing ^ ^ ^ :(, 
  what i do is go to a website like [ this one ] ( http://www.glasovoditel.eu/glasovoditel.html ) that offers a test for your political preferences . 
  once you 're done with the query , choose the questions of greater importance * for you * and choose the parties of your usual preference ( i choose all to get a better picture ) . 
  then , once you get the results , go to the websites of the top-3 parties and check their political agenda of actions to tackle the issues concerned in the questions . 
  whichever of these 3 offers the most reasonable solutions * in your opinion * is the one for you . 
  i personally do n't think voting for small parties is a waste of my vote , because that is * my * choice and i do n't see how those small parties will ever get to implement their solutions to some of the issues , if i and everyone else turns their back to them . 
  also , if you 're sick of the big parties , how would you expect to see any change , if you do n't give a chance at all , ever , to the small parties that speak more reasonably to you ? 
  yeah , you are correct !, 
  thank you for point it out !, 
  i fixed it now :d,
