  sorry , i had to edit the title of the article for the submission , because the original sounds like we are going to vote in 2016 . 
  [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aromanians#names_and_classification ) might help . . 
  as far as my memory goes , i can point out exactly 2 cypriots , who are very active on this sub . 
  those are / u/walkereu , whose submissions are primarily in r/europe , and / u/meidei , who you can expect to see at the weekly news round-ups , doing it for cyprus news & events . 
  \\  implying the romans did n't establish the city under the name * civitas montanensium * in 2nd century c.e. 
  now , shoo , shoo , you troll !, 
  i must say i had doubts about her ep hearing , but then i read :  when meps from ukip tried to destabilise her , georgieva won applause from the audience . 
  one mep asked her how she would cut the `` enormous bureaucratic machine '' of the eu , which in his words was bigger than the british army . 
  `` i 'm worried for the british army '' , georgieva replied . 
  and i thought : `` damn , she knows her shit ! '', 
  [ montana ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montana,_bulgaria ) is the nearest city . 
  bravo , cyprus !, 
  and to the balkan countries , of course !, 
  nothing certain so far . 
  however , human error has been thrown around here and there in the tv interviews of local people . 
  most have confirmed that the people there were working on 250 bgn ( ~ 127 eur ) wage per month under 0 labour safety conditions . 
  here 's also an [ article from the irish independent ] ( http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/phil-hogan-wins-backing-for-eu-commissioner-post-30632701.html ) . 
  the comments there seem rather disapproving of this news . 
  so , irish redditors , what do you think ? 
  in a special news report on tv an hour ago confirmed 15 dead - 13 men and 2 women . 
  tomorrow was announced [ national day of mourning ] ( http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=163763 ) . 
   ** hungary **  ~ ~ get into an argument about hungarian history and keep mentioning that it is an eastern european nation . 
  keep mixing up budapest and bucharest and when corrected , insist that both cities are the same anyway . ~ ~ say that ** trianon is the best treaty in mankind history ** . 
  ftfy . 
  are you saying you want [ more ?

  let me make it up for you . 
  here 's [ # 3 on z rock radio 's ranking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rafmwxxfe6s ) . 
  / r/imaginarymaps, 
  have a great time then !, 
  experts say it 's not an actual island as it 's basically volcanic sand ( and other elements ) that floats on the surface of the ocean . 
  here 's a [ video report ] ( http://btvnews.bg/article/lifestyle/liubopitno/biznesmen-predlaga-na-balgarija-plavasht-ostrov-ot-pemza-v-tihija-okean.html ) by one of the tv news channels here that shows how it looks from above as well as its location . 
  i hope you 're not traveling by train . 
  erm , this is about serbia , not bulgaria , but oh well . . anyways , for everyone , who 's a bit shocked by / u/intromatt 's comment , he did an [ ama ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ilivein/comments/1wt4tr/hey_everyone_i_am_a_canadian_from_victoria_bc_who/ ) over at / r/ilivein a couple of months ago . 
  bulgaria can not into overseas territories . . ^ :(, 
   how to snore in seven languages  bulgarian : hurrrrr can confirm . 
  i 'm also glyoking as i 'm typing this . 
  your level of tolerance is higher than mine then . 
   my experience was rather unpleasant . . ^ :(, 
  i believe the european commission had already considered something in that direction . 
  it 's called the [ common consolidated corporate tax base ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_consolidated_corporate_tax_base ) , which is a set of common rules for determining the tax base of companies with operations in all or just a group of the eu member states . 
  the commissioner-designate pierre moscovici ( from france ) said in his [ answers to the ep questionnaire ( pdf !, 
  ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/about/juncker-commission/docs/2014-ep-hearings-reply-moscovici_en.pdf ) that he intends to bring the ccctb back into the spotlight . 
  ( see page 5 to read his answers about the eu and national tax policies ) his ep hearing will be on thursday morning and i 'm sure these things will be brought up . 
  you 've never flown with spanish , italian or portuguese people , have n't you ? 
  in that case , lucky you !, 
  edit : it seems spanish , italian and portuguese people just do n't realize how ** loud ** they are ** everywhere ** . 
  ok , i 'll look forward to your link , citing the law . 
   why other nations does n't follow it the refugees that get here in bg do n't want permanent residence permits , because it 's not their final destination and only wait until they get a refugee status so they could move to the wealthy countries . 
  at least that is what i hear on the news . . 
  so that is probably why the issuance of such permits in other countries does n't happen . 
  this is done to ease the work of the swedish institutions , correct ? 
  what is the difference between permanent residence permit and citizenship in sweden ? 
  when it 's from one latin alphabet ( with its own special/additional letters ) to another latin alphabet ( with its own special/additional letters ) it 's called [ transliteration ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transliteration ) . 
  example : energija ( croatian ) -  ener\u0123ija ( latvian ) . 
  when it 's cyrillic to latin it 's [ translit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/translit ) . 
  example : \u0415\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f ( bulgarian ) -  energija ( croatian ) . 
  however , both have to take into account the rules of the [ phonemic orthography ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phonemic_orthography ) . 
  they probably chose the wrong lenses . 
  op posted the source link down in the comments . 
  it seems eurostat just did n't have data for those indices and that 's why some countries appear and disappear in the graphs . . 
  yeah , helsinki and madrid are both 1cm off . . and university of turin looks like it moved to rome . 
  it 's the flag of [ republika srpska ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republika_srpska ) . 
  one would think the people at cern would know where sofia is located . . 
  guess not . 
   i do not understand why the wages are so low even the european commission [ does n't know ( ! pdf !, 
  ) ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2014/csr2014_bulgaria_en.pdf ) how the minimum wage is set here . 
  indeed . 
  yes . 
  it is a polish satiric drawing and i got it from * that one sub * , which no one should ever mention outside of it . 
  well , according to [ this website ] ( http://financialorbit.blogspot.com/2014/08/charts-today-s-targets-big-us-market.html ) , it 's tuition fees only , so i answered my own question . 
  you traitor !, 
  delete that smile there stat !, 
   a couple of months ago people freaked their shit over the hrw 's report on bulgaria and alleged beatings of illegal immigrants on the border . 
  months ? 
  i believe it was [ 2 weeks ago ] ( http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/09/18/bulgaria-new-evidence-syrians-forced-back-turkey ) . 
  seriously though , i was genuinely asking . . 
  better correct it before anyone else notices !, 
  :d and thank you for providing all that information !, 
  erm , i 'm pretty sure you coloured crete island not cyprus there . 
  what 's behind these figures ? 
  thank you . 
  [ luxembourg ] ( http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=earn_mw_cur&amp;lang=en ), 
  some countries are missing . . op , can we have the source link ( s ) , please ? 
  for what year/time frame is it ? 
  i do n't think i have ever chatted with another bulgarian , who transcribes '' \u044f '' as `` ja '' . 
  most would type it as `` ya '' or `` q '' ( and to a lesser extent `` ia '' ) since we use `` j '' for our '' \u0436 '' , when we type in latin script . 
  when we do that we call it writing in '' [ \u0428\u043b\u044c\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430 ] ( https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%a8%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%be%d0%ba%d0%b0%d0%b2%d0%b8%d1%86%d0%b0 ) '' ( or `` monkey script '' :d ) . 
  from the article :  several reports have observed that romania is making faster progress than bulgaria . 
  so , yes . 
  we might get in with croatia a few years after you , but that 's also debatable .
