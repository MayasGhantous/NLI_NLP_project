  german government to hinder potential profits for a german company ? 
  hm , i kinda doubt that will happen , but we 'll see , i guess . 
  i fully agree with your second paragraph . 
  the colour-blind will have a field day with this map . 
  ^ or ^ maybe ^ i ^ need ^ a ^ visit ^ to ^ the ^ ophthalmologist ? 
  you can add [ the netherlands , italy , france and germany ] ( http://www.south-stream-offshore.com/about-us/shareholders/ ) to the list of countries who want to sell bulgaria to our `` most orthodox christian '' and `` most slavic '' brothers from north asia . 
  well , yes , that one case does n't really have relevance to the other member states . 
  as for your second sentence , why do you think it will piss off everyone else ? 
  i 'm asking as i think we 're all in this together so if something does affect part of the `` us '' and if it is substantiated , the rest will probably support the affected part rather than the , say , `` bully '' ( although this is a solidarity-based view ) . 
  : i do n't like these terms as there 's quite the negativity in them . . 
  i can think of [ one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistic_issues_concerning_the_euro#bulgarian ) :  initially , the ecb and the european commission insisted that bulgaria change the name it uses for the currency from \u0415\u0412\u0420\u041e to \u0415\u0423\u0420\u041e , claiming the currency should have an official and standard spelling across the eu . 
  bulgaria on the other hand stated that it wants to take into account the different alphabet and the principle of phonetic orthography in the bulgarian language . 
  [ 9 ]  the issue was decisively resolved in favour of bulgaria at the 2007 eu summit in lisbon , allowing bulgaria to use the cyrillic spelling ** \u0435\u0432\u0440\u043e ** on all official eu documents .

   `` yes , they 're worrying that it could be a problem in their ** parliaments ** , '' the diplomat added . 
  has your parliament indicated something in connection to this ? 
  on our side , we currently do n't have a working parliament , just council of ministers , as we have an interim government , so i personally ca n't take this `` diplomat '' 's claims about us seriously . 
  another issue i find in this article is :  '' [ ... ] and ceta will bring exactly that , '' said marcin bosacki , poland 's ambassador to canada . 
  so they approached poland 's ambassador to canada to comment on the topic , but do n't do the same with the romanian and bulgarian ambassadors to canada ?

  is it just me or does iceland seem to be almost as big as poland on this map ? 
  also , op , can we have a source , please ?
