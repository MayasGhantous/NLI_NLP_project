   macedonian dialect of bulgarian please , note how it is a * dialect * , not a language . 
  and yes , i agree that the glagolitic alphabet is the first slavic alphabet , but the ohrid school did not use the glagolitic alphabet , they used the cyrillic one , which , as i have already pointed out , was created in preslav . 
  thank you for your warm words !, 
  very much appreciated !, 
  yes , uhm . .

  [ the first cyrillic script was created in the preslav literary school ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_cyrillic_alphabet ) . 
  both schools together then translated various books , starting with the bible ( for the ohrid school see [ here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clement_of_ohrid#legacy ) ) . 
  we 're just having a discussion . 
   as there was no croatia at the time i was born . 
  [ are you sure ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_republic_of_croatia ) ? 
  how is it not in contradiction ?

  i have already stated the truth about all this in [ another comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2h4l5p/macedonians_dont_want_to_be_called_slavs/ckpiiiq ) . 
  translation :  macedonia is considered the cradle of slavic literacy and culture , and the city of ohrid as the jerusalem of the slavic orthodoxy . 
  ^ [ citation ^ needed ] the first slavic alphabet was created namely in macedonia , and the first codification of the old church slavonic languages was made . 
  [ nope ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ohrid_literary_school ) and [ nope ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_church_slavonic ) :  the school was established in ohrid in 886 by saint clement of ohrid ** on the order of [ boris i of bulgaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_i_of_bulgaria ) ** simultaneously or shortly after the establishment of the [ preslav literary school ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/preslav_literary_school ) . 
   initially old church slavonic was written with the [ glagolitic alphabet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_alphabet#origins_of_the_glagolitic_characters ) , but later glagolitic was replaced by cyrillic , [ 7 ] which was developed in the first bulgarian empire by a decree of boris i of bulgaria in the 9th century .
