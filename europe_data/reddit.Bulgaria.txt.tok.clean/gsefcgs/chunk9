  as for the ` well made ' , i 'd give it 8/10 for similarity ( politburo , restrictions on hot water , food and supplies for some of the participants etc. ) . 
  we also have [ x factor bulgaria ] ( http://xfactor.novatv.bg/ ) and [ the voice of bulgaria ] ( http://glasatnabulgaria.btv.bg/ ) .

  thank you !, 
  can any person seek asylum for being discriminated in their home country or not ? 
  if yes , what type of discrimination ? 
  genuinly interested . 
  you knew beforehand that this is from bulgarian national television , did n't you ? 
  bulgarian mythology is a mixture of thracian , slavic and bulgar myths and the focus is basically on forests , rivers , soil and fire . 
  the only thing i can think of is the mythical creature `` yura '' , which is a spirit living in the shallow coastal waters , barely mentioned in the bulgarian mythical tales . 
  no sea or ocean stories , sorry . . 
  oh , you did !, 
  sorry , i totally did n't notice !, 
  i 'll look up the fees for bulgaria and will let you know !, 
  just one small detail : are we talking public or private university tuition fees ? 
  [ article ] ( http://www.vesti.bg/razvlechenia/lyubopitno/krasiva-bylgarska-uchitelka-obira-ovaciite-v-internet-6022727#.vbsaw_-ofwy.facebook ) ( in bulgarian ) whilst everyone is talking about the scottish referendum , on the other side of europe , media decided to draw our attention to a 28 years old teacher over internet fame . 
   photo of a beautiful bulgarian teacher , leading her class of first-grade pupils to their room , stole the show and the hungry eyes of users in the social networks . 
   the image was published in the popular website for funny pictures [ 9gag ] ( http://9gag.com/gag/aavdgb2 ) . 
   because of the great interest to the image , whose description reads : `` just a first grade teacher at the first day of school in bulgaria '' , the site decided to share it on their page in the social network [ facebook ] ( https://www.facebook.com/9gag/photos/a.109041001839.105995.21785951839/10152698832101840/?type=1&amp;relevant_count=1 ) . 
   after only 8 hours the image gathered over 230,100 likes , 9822 shares and 7609 comments . 
   `` i doubt the fathers will not be missing at the parents-teacher meetings '' , some of the users commented jokingly . 
   `` welcome to bulgaria '' , proudly commented some of our countrymen on the network , while people from all corners of the world explained how they are currently booking their one-way tickets to come live here . 
   according to the comments of other users , the father in the background is not taking a picture of his child on its first day of school , rather of the beautiful teacher , because `` his pov is perfect '' . 
   a boy from kenya thinks the bulgarian woman is `` the natural version of kim kardashian '' . 
  his opinion quickly gathered followers . 
   others are happy the teacher is not teaching in high school , because nobody would listen to what she 's saying . 
   `` i want to be a bulgarian '' , one of the most popular comments by men says . 
   what about us ? 
  we can only rejoice at the fact that there are foreigners who say those words . 
  i have no comment . 
   global funding would be another option . 
  now , lets reverse this . 
  what is an option for funding , if it does n't have a budget ? 
   i 'm not aware of any such projects i am not aware , as well , but from what i 've read creative europe is a fairly new program of the eu , so we may hear soon . . 
  i 'm seeing it as sort of a copy of the [ erasmus ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/erasmus-plus/index_en.htm program ) program , but instead of focusing on education , it 's on culture . 
  seeing as it 's * another * option of funding the creative sector aside from national level , of course it needs to have a budget . 
  also , some projects are eu-wide . 
  for example , a joint project by universities of arts across the eu could be successfully implemented thanks to this option of funding , whereas they could struggle to do so if they relied on national funding ( if there is such on national level ) . 
  this is why this exists in my opinion - so everyone could work together to produce and/or preserve culture/cultural projects . 
   i plain do not think the eu should have any competence in this area why ? 
  actors , producers , directors etc. 
  all pay taxes . 
  creative europe 's total budget is 1.46 billion eur , which is about 0.15 % of the total eu budget for 2014-2020 . 
  some struggle , why should n't they have the possibility to get eu funding for some of their projects ? 
  i was wondering the same thing about bulgaria !, 
  thank you !, 
  one of the sub-programs of [ creative europe ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/creative-europe/index_en.htm ) already covers film-making , i think . 
  so , swiss german ? 
  off the top of my head : 1 .

  song gets almost banned in 1944 by the bulgarian communist party for not conforming to communists ' narrative/goal to create a macedonian nation , but the lyrics are changed and it focuses on other battles .

  hm , i expected a story about how you had a terrible experience there that scarred you for life . 
  guess not . 
  i ca n't see how any of that should hold you from a short visit or a vacation there . 
  in bulgaria we have a saying `` hate the government , not the country '' , meaning that just because the people in power are complete idiots , does n't mean that the regular people are just the same and that the country would n't give you at least a decent tourist experience . 
  every country has been through shit and greece does not make an exception . 
  why hate them for that ?!, 
  greek people are very good at partying and , if you can , i seriously recommend you to go to any tavern in greece to see how that goes . 
  i understand your point , but keep in mind that residents ' experience ! = visitors ' experience . 
  for you , it may have lost its charm , but visitors might fall in love with the city . 
  if i may ask , why ? 
  oh , gosh , where do i start ?!, 
  ~ ~ solun ~ ~ [ thessaloniki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thessaloniki ) , although an industrial city , has a lot to offer . 
  from [ churches ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_the_holy_apostles_%28thessaloniki%29#mediaviewer/file:church_of_the_twelve_apostles,_thessaloniki,_full.jpg ) from byzantine times / with byzantine-inspired architecture to museums , like the [ museum of byzantine culture ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/museum_of_byzantine_culture ) and , for those who are fans of modern art , there 's the [ macedonian museum of contemporary art ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/macedonian_museum_of_contemporary_art ) i recommend visiting . 
  the city harboured a large jewish community up until wwii , so there is a [ jewish museum ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jewish_museum_of_thessaloniki ) that would open your eyes as to how they lived through the centuries . 
  for young people and the lgbt people , [ mykonos island ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mykonos ) has quite the [ charm ] ( http://www.travelsupermarket.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/mykonos.jpg ) . 
  another gay-friendly place is the town of [ malia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/malia,_crete ) on crete island , which is more [ laid-back ] ( http://i60.tinypic.com/2nhojo1.jpg ) and with a not as vibrant night life than mykonos . 
  mykonos is pretty much the ibiza of greece . 
   ok , that 'd be all . 
  lol this reminds me of a bulgarian song from the 90s where it was sung `` white mercedes is chasing me in life and it always follows me '' . 
  it 's a crappy song . 
  damn you !, 
  that map needs some work though . 
  some points are nameless and some unavailable routes , such as dimitrovgrad ( not mentioned on map ) -  svilengrad , need to be in a dotted line . 
  [ this one ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/bulgaria_railroads_map_bg.svg/1280px-bulgaria_railroads_map_bg.svg.png ) is better imo .
