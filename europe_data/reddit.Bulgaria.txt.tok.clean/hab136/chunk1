why do you think you 'd use less data ? 
  because i 'm busy swimming , lying on the beach , walking through museums , experiencing the local cuisine , or whatever else i went to the place to do ? 
   versus at home where i 'm trying to keep up with email from work , chat with people to make plans , browsing the web while waiting for the metro , etc. 
  on holiday i tend to have everyone that i need to talk to right next to me , so no need for communication devices . 
   you 'll probably also rely more on navigation features and look up other information because you are not familiar with the city . 
  from my last two trips to berlin and rome ( when data was so expensive we just shut it off ) , we just wandered a lot . 
    and you 'll probably send more photos if you are on holiday . 
  i tend not to post pictures during my holiday . 
  of course , i 'm only describing my own usage ; i was n't trying to generalize for everyone . 
  some people ( like my girlfriend ) have to immediately post pictures of everything they do to facebook . 
  that has n't passed yet . 
  that 's not law yet , so not something we can count on . 
  i voted to give myself a 200-year $ 10 million loan at 0 % interest , but this now requires the approval of the bank . 
  i use 200-400 mb a month , depending on how much time i stay away from wifi . 
  at $ 0.20 / mb , that would be $ 40 - 80/month . 
  that 's cheaper than a lot of hotel wifi prices . 
  for a week away , assuming i did n't change my usage at all , that 'd only be $ 10 - 20 . 
  that 's low enough that i 'd leave my data on , especially since i probably would change my usage and use data a lot less . 
  they 're done , though . 
  2014 was the last reduction planned . 
  same reason we use qwerty keyboards instead of dvorak or other layouts - [ network effects ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/network_effect ) . 
  ( yes , i know about azerty and other variations , i 'm lumping them in with qwerty ), 
   i managed to clip the edge of the number of emigrants to ireland by accident , how do you emigrate to ireland by accident ? 
  go visit and forget to come back ? 
  a british pension goes a long , long , long , long way in bulgaria . 
  per [ this site ] ( http://www.nsi.bg/bg/content/3223/%d0%b3%d0%be%d0%b4%d0%b8%d1%88%d0%bd%d0%b8-%d0%b4%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%bd%d0%b8 ) , average total household income in bulgaria was about 436 euro/month in 2012 . 
  average total individual income was about 184 euro/month . 
  this is total income , not just salary . 
  per [ this site ] ( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pensioners-incomes-series-201011 ) , average british pensions are 1799 euro per month !, 
  retiring in a country where your * individual * pension is over 4 times the average * household * income is fairly attractive , especially if you retire as a couple and have 8 times the normal household income . 
  you can go from struggling to get by in the uk to never again worrying about money . 
   especially after the state has invested in them and their education . 
  does the state pay for their education ? 
  if so , are the doctors not required to work a few years in romania in exchange for the education ? 
  the trophy is more rain . 
  i read it , expecting a literal bloody nose . 
   but the fault here lies at the doorway of the british government not the echr . 
  the ec has a whole [ blog dedicated to refuting uk media `` mistakes '' ] ( http://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ecintheuk/ ) . 
  i agree ; 25-34 is not `` young adult '' , it 's just `` adult '' . 
  woohoo , bulgaria 's # 1 with $ 0.08 per kwh !, 
  here 's another site with the same info , but with exact numbers instead of pretty charts : http://www.energy.eu/#domestic-elec, 
   it would also be perfect if i would n't get only french results if i 'm just visiting france . 
  http://google.com/ncr ( for `` no country redirect '' ), 
   but here in north america , for the vast majority of people they are simply not practical . 
  the vast majority of north americans live in a city and rarely drive more than 100 km away from it . 
  they 'd be fine with evs . 
  the vast majority of the * land * of north american is sparsely populated and the people living in those sparsely populated places would not be happy with current evs . 
  hydrogen both leaks through its containers and corrodes them at the same time . 
  it 's also low density - you 'd need huge tanks to match gas car range . 
  hydrogen also currently sucks for the environment : '' [ as of 2014 , 95 % of hydrogen is made from methane ] ( http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/08/05/3467115/tesla-toyota-hydrogen-cars-batteries/ ) '' ( natural gas ) . 
  producing hydrogen from water ( electrolysis ) can be done , but it 's expensive and inefficient . 
  it makes more sense to just keep the electricity as electricity instead of turning it into hydrogen . 
   an electric car only produces less co2 than a fossile one if you run it with electricity that comes out of solar/wind/nuclear energy . 
  there 's two pollution issues : 1 . greenhouse gases ( co2 ) 2 . health problems from filthy air ( particulates , nox , co , so2 , others ) by moving the pollution source from the car to the power plant , you clean up the air in the city and contain all the pollution in a few spots ( power plants ) which are usually far from people . 
  having a few sources makes it easier to monitor , fix , and regulate - and eventually replace with cleaner options , which will then fix the greenhouse gases . 
  electric cars on their own do not solve everything - the power plants also need to be changed . 
  economics will eventually take care of that , as the price of producing renewables plummets . 
   does not put load on the grid electric cars mostly charge at night , when the grid is empty . 
  for charging during the day , that 's why one of musk 's other businesses is solar , and home power storage . 
   and can be produced decentralizedly ( say , at an offshore windfarm ) . 
  the offshore windfarm produces electricity , and you * can * store the energy of that electricity in hydrogen . . but it 's easier to just keep it as electricity . 
  electric generation can also be produced decentrally - aside from utility-scale production , every home can install solar panels , and a battery to smooth out the demand . 
  hydrogen is terrible as an energy storage medium . 
  the density is terrible , so you need huge tanks . 
  it leaks through every container unless you liquefy it ( at \u2212 252 c ) , which has its own problems . 
  moreover , the cheapest way to make it has been to burn natural gas , a fact that has not been lost on current fossil fuel providers . 
  the all-inclusive resorts on the seaside are nice . 
   or speaking about deploying missiles there . 
  you know , for defence , of course . 
  well , not mexico , but close enough : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cuban_missile_crisis cuba is 90 miles ( 145 km ) from the us . 
  i did n't imply that . 
  xenophobia is fear of foreigners . 
  nationalists are n't necessarily * afraid * of foreigners ; they just believe themselves better than foreigners . 
  because it 's usually not just `` we 're great '' ; it 's `` we 're better than everyone else '' which leads to `` our neighbor nation is inferior , and we deserve what they have more than they do '' and `` anyone who we do n't identify as a national is inferior '' , even if they 're third-generation citizens . 
  this all leads to bad things , like when the [ u.s. rounded up u.s. citizens during ww2 and put them into prison camps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internment_of_japanese_americans ) simply because they were of japanese descent ( not `` american '' enough , despite being born and raised in the u.s. ) humans love to divide themselves into `` us '' vs `` them '' , and it gets real easy to justify action against `` them '' . 
  if people are convinced that `` us '' includes their neighbor states ( for example identifying as a european instead of just identifying as a national of your country ) then it makes no sense to attack or steal from or envy another part of `` us '' . 
  some people go further as see `` us '' as all humans ( humanitarians ) ; others see only their family as `` us '' ( tribal nations ) or only themselves ( egotists ) . 
  simply put , nationalism enables aggression , even against your own state 's people . 
  right - the state does n't know whether he 's speaking the truth , so why fine him ? 
  if someone thinks he 's lying , then have a trial and determine whether or not he is . 
  innocence is presumed for the person he 's speaking about ; why is innocence not presumed for the person speaking ? 
   naming a person as `` he did it '' , until the person is proven guilty , has to be a crime . 
  this is defamation ( libel , slander ) - but only if it 's not true . 
  telling the truth should not be illegal . 
   no i did n't . 
    `` those polls are incredibly dubious considering how the votes turned out in individual states . '', 
  the national polls are dubious . . and you contrast that with the individual states , which implies that they 're not dubious . 
  dubious for what ? 
  for accurately portraying national opinion . 
  if you meant to say something different , then you 're welcome to retract that and say something else . 
   in the us it 's close 30 years . 
  so 7 years is maybe a quarter of a generation at most . 
  you 're right , i had old data . 
  it used to be about 20 , now it 's high 20s in the us . 
  average age of first child is 26 . 
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generation#familial_generation * http://www.ancestry.co.uk/cs/learning/howlongisgeneration * http://www.babycenter.com/0_surprising-facts-about-birth-in-the-united-states_1372273.bc there 's also apparently several definitions for `` generation '' - time between your birth and the birth of your first child vs `` social '' generation , for example . 
  so i 'll concede it may only be a quarter generation . 
  the point remains that 7 years of old people died and 7 years of new 18-year-olds started voted . . and that 's a lot of people . 
  about [ 2.5 million people die per year in the us ] ( http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm ) , so 7 years would be about 17.5 million people , or 5.4 % of the population nationwide . 
  california has about 12.1 % of the population , and presumably an average number of births/deaths , so 2.1 million people died in the past 7 years , or about 5.4 % of california 's population ( 38.8 million ) .
