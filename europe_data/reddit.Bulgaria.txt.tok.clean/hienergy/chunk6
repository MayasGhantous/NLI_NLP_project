  all options required either changes to the constitution or annexation . 
  there was not a single option for status quo . 
  none . 
  hardly a referendum when you do n't give people an option to vote for status quo , would n't you agree ? 
  occupation by an aggressive foreign military force aside , of course . 
   the right of people to self-determination is a cardinal principle in modern international law . 
  it is !, 
  it is recognized under the charter of the united nations specifically !, 
  why did n't russia follow international law procedures and decided to annex it illegally instead ? 
   if you think it is illegal , then kosovo shall be part of serbia and syria intact . 
  in kosovo , there was an attempted genocide . 
  a little different than ukraine , would n't you agree ? 
  russia supported an illigatimate dictator who violated human rights , exterminated the opposition ** and released islamic terrorists who formed isis ** . 
   well , russia will never return crimea never say never , 
   not exactly , they train and support rebels , some say even direct them . 
  why not admit , i don ` t know really , it seems pretty legal , although morally questionable . 
  nope , not legal at all . 
  annexing territories and waging illegal wars is definitely not `` pretty legal '' . 
  `` morally questinable '' is putting it lightly . 
  especially in the 21st century , especially in europe and the doorstep of the eu . 
   yeah but us initially supported `` moderate '' rebels . 
  isis was further development . 
  isis would not have developed without assad 's help . 
  the moderate rebels were a better alternative than assad , however none of them remain today ( unfortunately ) . 
   depends on your logic , according to putin , there are plenty of reasons to support those guys . 
  yes , the reasons being that ukraine should be rightfully russian , should not be a sovereign country and should not choose the eu over russia . 
  none of these are legitimate reasons , hence he has to face the consequences . 
  i hope we manage to sanction the russian economy out of existence since russia does not seem to have learned its lessons from the cold war . 
   you have any proof they are not ? 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/syrias-assad-moves-to-allay-fury-after-security-forces-fire-on-protesters/2011/03/26/affozddb_story.html ) . 
  what about you ? 
   ukranians are killing each other mostly , russia is supplying weapons and intel . 
  like us and turkey in syria . 
  russia is also sending soldiers ~ ~ on vacation ~ ~ to murder ukranians but does n't have the balls and honesty to admit it . 
  also , the situations are hardly comparable , since there is no `` islamic state of ukraine and crimea '' or something . 
  russia has no reason to be in ukraine . 
   aha , yes . 
  no way they were telling lies . 
  you have any proof they are lying ? 
   i don ` t know , iraq has several hundred thousands to million plus casualties . 
  crimea had one guy dead . 
  maybe it was better to annex it ? 
  and you conveniently left out the thousands of people killed in ukraine . 
   isis is originally from iraq , not syria . 
  how on earth assas could create it ? 
  he had a secular state initially . 
  more like us created it by removing saddam . 
  read the article . 
  assad realesed the jihadists who founded isis from prison . 
   true , but if you consider russia a barbarian state for this matter , then eu should be a barbarian state too . 
  it does exactly the same on regular basis . 
  where is the difference ? 
  when was the last time the eu annexed the territory of another country ? 
  when did the eu start a war that it denies participating in ? 
   european sanctions are way more important than american sanctions . 
  not necessarily . 
  the reduction of ravenue from trade is as much due to the sanction as it is due to the failing russian economy . 
  american companies have billions of lost ravenue as well , take exxon mobil who were about to start extremely expensive drilling in russia worth multiple billions of dollars before the sanctions were introduced . 
   well , you have barbarians at the gates because of us/eu actions in libya . 
  you are missing the part where russian-backed assad [ released the jihadists who created isis ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/assad-syria-devil-endgame-putin-obama/407635/ ) . 
  isis would not exist if it were n't for assad . 
   russia is a threat to ukraine , yes . 
  but how it is a threat to eu ? 
  yes , it has started a war in europe , attacked ukraine for becoming pro-eu and continuing negotiations with the eu . 
  russia also meddles in elections around the eu and tries to destabilize the union , openly claiming that the eu and its values are its enemies . 
  you bet we have barbarians at the gates . 
   because if there are rules , they should be applied to everybody . 
  there are rules and there are also priorities . 
  these priorities dictate that the most dangerous regimes should be sanctioned first . 
  would n't you agree that it would be foolish to sanction countries that pose little to no threat while we have barbarians at the gates ? 
  no need to read it again since you failed to point out how the eu introduced more sanctions that the us . 
  i read it , and it does not say that the eu introduced more sanctions , but that it has greater loss of ravenue . 
  that does not indicate that it has placed more severe sanctions , just that it had more trade with russia in the first place . 
  this is due to russia 's counter-sanctions , not due to eu sanctions . 
  why do you keep bringing up turkey ? 
  i am not opposed to never introducing sanctions to them , since they have n't started a war in europe , which is a far greater concern for the ** european ** union . 
  it does n't say so in the article that the supported south stream specifically . 
   sorry , i assume people on reddit are able to perform simple google searchs . 
  i assume they can read too , yet you did n't provide any evidence of the eu enacting * more * ** sanctions ** . 
  do you know what a sanction is ? 
  and where does it say germany supported south stream specifically ? 
  europe needs to prioritize the threats towards it . 
  right now , the biggest threat is the barbaric state that starts wars in europe itself and deliberately attacks out democracies . 
  hence , sanctioning russia is a far more important priority than sanctioning turkey , which so far has n't done anything on the level of russia 's crimes . 
   this idea that russia founded isis and overthrew assad ( or contributed greatly to either ) has to be among the most stupid things i have ever read on this sub . 
  [ educate yourself then ] ( https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/assad-syria-devil-endgame-putin-obama/407635/ ) . 
  russia 's interest in the region is to prevent qatar from building a pipeline through syria that would compete with their gas pipileines in europe . 
  this is why they need assad so badly and why they keep supporting him . 
  as for the creation of isis and how assad and putin gave rise to it , just read the article i provided or the numerous other ones on the subject . 
  isis would not exist if assad did not release the radicals who created it from prison . 
   we are talking turkey now . 
  with russia is all clear . 
  but supporting rebels and de facto controlling part of syria with official turkish army is no different from ukraine . 
  why not sanction them ? 
  again , because they have n't annexed other countries ' territories , they have n't started an illegal war they deny participating in and they have n't been attacking our democracies . 
  controlling parts of ex-isis territories is not the same as invading ukraine . 
  also , as i mentioned , turkey has to guts to acknowledge it participates in a war against isis , unlike the cowardly russia that denies any involvement in ukraine ( only russia is capable of such an obvious hypocritical lie ) . 
   eu has set up sanctions against russia that are many times more important than us sanctions vs russia .

   they won ` t do it officially , but they already control it .
