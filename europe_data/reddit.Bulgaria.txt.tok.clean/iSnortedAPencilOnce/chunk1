austerity equals recovery . 
  see it 's better already !, 
  let 's have ourselves a good ol' fashioned market economy , that still meets the demands of its modern population !, 
   now you lost me . 
  you argue against sanctions on russia due to possible gas-related actions by putin and part of the problem is the existing contract ? 
  that makes no sense . 
  none . 
   if contracts are kept it is the best case scenario anyway . 
  how does that not make any sense . 
  2022 is the year specified in poland 's contract when it is no longer obligated to obey gazprom . 
  until then it is to meet standard annual supply of about 10 billion cubic metres . 
  so tell me , if for the next 8 years poland is under contract to annually receive gas from putin ( while its price is also adjusted based on the gas market in europe ) , how is it not tied the possible sanctions ? 
   state controlled gas prices ... may not change did you know that the word `` gullible '' is not in the oxford english dictionary ? 
  ugh i mean of course they 'll help . 
  in the event of a continent-wide crysis , all our european hearts will start beating in tandem and we will march the streets . 
  logistically spreading gas while shouting the slogan of the french revolution `` libert\u00e9 , \u00e9galit\u00e9 , fraternit\u00e9 '' . 
  equally distributed gas for all , with equal costs , supplied forever , because reserves are magical , they never end . 
  were you born yesterday :d :d, 
  * you said that poland is about to get 100 % independent of russian gas . 
  i said that the best case scenario for that to happen is in 8 years , or does poland have a magical contract erasing machine too ? 
  * i only have data in english up until 2006 , so i didnt imagine that in 8 years poland switched from 95,4 % use of solid fuels , to heating its entire population with domestic gas . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.res-h-policy.eu/res-h_policy_market-report-pl_\\ ( d3 \\ ) _ english.pdf ) `` in 2006 , the use of hard coal was almost 1200 pj i.e. 
  approximately 65 % of the entire energy of all fuels used in those sub-sectors ( production of electric energy and heat ) . 
  lignite made up 29 % of the energy . 
  despite the significant share of solid fuels ( over 95 % ) in the total energy related fuel use in production of electric energy and heat , a slow decreasing trend can be noticed since the late 1990s ( from app . 
  98.1 % in 1998 till 95.4 % in 2006 ) poland 's industry needs 43 % of all heat generated , so that 's not counting construction , agriculture and transport . 
  * supply is not going to be cut of and the prices will be arguably stable . 
  but i think you 're intentionally ignoring the projected difference in prices and the expected reception by the public . 
  can latvia introduce an alternative for when that gas in its reserves eventually runs out ? 
  then develop the planning and infrastructure in time before the mass riots ? 
   about to get in 8 years at best  independent heating 38 million people burning coal  competent politicians radoslaw sikorski : '' ... the lng terminal may not be profitable but at least it will fly a polish flag ''  russia stops selling gas to europe ; eu without russian gas that will never happen and no one is implying that it will . 
  but putin has shown that he can manipulate the price and quantity at will . 
   russia ca n't give two shits about the eu . 
  30 % of its exports go to china and germany . 
  germany right now is n't going to let europe go a second without russian gas . 
  when it has covered its own ass in a few years with alternatives to russian imported gas , germany is suddenly going to jump up , say it 's had enough with russia , and proceed to immediately rip every other eu country 's contract with gazprom . 
   `` hey china , we heard about your gdp , population , and consumption growth . 
  sure would be a shame if that production demand was n't able to meet that consumption requirement . '', 
   `` but ... ''  `` no buts , or no contract at all . '', 
  well i can admit when i 've been proven wrong . 
  i did n't know about estonia 's success in oil shale . 
  still does n't change the fact that gas is n't used for just heating though . 
  9.1 % is gas and 72 % is coal . 
  can you guess where that coal comes from and whose company it is ? 
  edit : i 'm wrong . 
  [ i think you 're not too up to date with the issue . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/search?btng=1&amp;pws=0&amp;q=russia+china+gas+deal&amp;gws_rd=ssl ), 
  and i 'm trying to make the point that you and maybe some other people might handle the cold , but all this bloodshed up until now is going to look incredibly insignificant , once you see the new prices of everything and their impact on millions of people . 
  last time i looked around countries like bulgaria , belarus , macedonia , serbia and montenegro do n't have bucketloads of money lying around . 
  of course no one wants to be dependent on russia , but this whole thread is full of people basically saying that europe can go on without putin 's gas , when in reality that is not the case, 
  when they settled hundreds of years ago , every home had a fireplace and a place to get wood from . 
  in 2014 now , houses and panel blocks , which are the predominant places where people live in ee , the alternatives to central heating are electric heaters , which are inefficient at heating anything beyond one room . 
  i 'm saying this as someone who has actually had to go by several winters with just a coat and an electric heater . 
  do you think ceausescu ever had to get a family of 9 through a winter with just coats ? 
  do you think he ever had to explain to a child that it 's cold and there is n't enough food , because the electricity bill is 4 figures long every month , and that if it 's not paid , then the electricity gets cut off ? 
  well you and me then might have grown up in an entirely different eastern europe . 
  i 'm ignoring that fact that you think that somehow everybody in ee has access to alternatives , that are not going to ruin their lives . 
  you 're basically saying that for eu to grow balls it 's going to have to endanger a big part of its population , without having a safe alternative ready . 
  i was n't trying to make the point that just power stations are going to suffer . 
  gas prices related to transportation are going to skyrocket . 
  every country has its reserves , but they can mostly last months . 
  norway and algeria ca n't make up for all of gazprom . 
  i partly agree on your second point , but i do n't have the time now to state my reserves . 
  edit # 3 : itt : * guys , seriously , fuck putin . 
  * *** i 've *** * had enough . 
  * *** we *** * should * *** all *** * do something . 
  what * *** we all *** * need to do first , is still * *** not *** * settle for higher prices in exchange for a secure source of energy imports . 
  c'mon let 's start screaming * *** sanctions !, 
  *** * and * *** military intervention !, 
  *** * sure , the outcome is gon na be tough for * ** some ** , * but do n't worry * , *** my *** * country can handle it . 
  * ~ ~ normally i 'm not the one to jump in in defense of politicians , but i think you 're missing the big picture . 
  before you shower me with downvotes , consider how strong putin 's grasp is over parts of the eu . ~ ~ [ ~ ~ here 's the graphic on the dependence of russian gas ~ ~ ] ( http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2014/03/russian%20gas%20europe%20reliance.jpg ) ~ ~ even ignoring all those countries below 50 % , a disturbance in the imports ( price or quantity ) from russia is going to be ** devastating ** . 
  in fact , the only event that could probably cause more ** civilian ** casualties , in one winter , would be an all out war . ~ ~ * ~ ~ estonia 100 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ finland 100 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ latvia 100 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ lithuania 100 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ slovakia 98 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ bulgaria 92 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ czech republic 77.6 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ greece 76 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ hungary 60 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ republic of macedonia 100 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ belarus 98 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ serbia & montenegro 87 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ ukraine 66 % ~ ~ * ~ ~ turkey 64 % ~ ~ ~ ~ people are n't just going to have a `` colder winter '' . 
  they 're going to have the coldest winter in their lives and i can assure you this is going to have a severe impact on tens of milions of people . ~ ~ ~ ~ edit : people gas is not used just directly for heating . 
  what do you think is going to happen with manufacturing and transportation in these countries ? 
  again i 'm not even defending putin . 
  i would 've been glad if his plane was the one to get shot down . 
  but you ca n't just go and shove your dick in gazprom 's face if you ca n't deal with the consequences . ~ ~ ~ ~ edit # 2 : here 's some more magical new information for you all . 
  europe also uses a lot of coal . 
  i 'm not even going to bother trying to explain how much , where it mostly comes from , to what ( whom ) it is tied to and so on . 
  bulgaria is completely wrong , but i 'm so happy it 's mentioned in a post that i do n't even care . 
  rumor has it that members were selected from an advanced tournament of tic-tac-toe . 
  poland simply produces a lot of energy . 
  should n't be surprising since it has about twice the population and almost 8 times the area of the netherlands . 
  having larger area i suppose statistically improves your chance of finding suitable locations to set up renewables , which would actually pay off ( excluding russia because of climate ) . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_in_poland http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_in_the_netherlands, 
  tell me , do brits receive a magical source of income when they settle in a remote bulgarian village ? 
  edit : of course i did n't take into account the staggering difference in pensions . 
  i 'm imagining all the villages that were abandoned by people to go find work in the cities , now filled with brits instead . 
  honestly , i see nothing wrong with a rural british minority . 
  although it will be interesting to see how they react when they realise why people actually left those places ... 
  that 's a terrible solution . 
  it might have worked for estonia , although i 've never personally heard how the public accepted it . 
  what i can say with complete certainty is that if you lay off so many people at once , and then not provide an alternative for * all * of them , you 're gon na have a lot more problems than when you did in the beginning . 
  no available mechanism exists that can change this . 
  the change has to be universal , i.e. 
  in every single person in the country . 
  so many people fail to get this . 
  it is clear that all this civil unrest is terribly bad for us economically , with all the extra spending on the government 's side and not to mention the conclusion the rest of the world seems to be making concerning our reasoning . 
  but the point should be clear to us and that 's whats important .
