  even if we have to go bankrupt , it will still be worth it to just once shove it so far up their asses , that in the future they actually start to think twice before trying to manipulate us in petty ways and not prioritize our needs first . 
  and a tl ; dr for all those unwilling to commit a few minutes : this year bulgaria has seen the most intense national uprising in decades . 
  protests started in february and you can read more about them here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_against_the_borisov_cabinet . 
  the most shocking events in the protests were the series of self-immolations by desperate citizens https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_bulgarian_self-immolations . 
  the resignation of the borisov cabinet led to preliminary elections which resulted in a `` hung parliament '' . 
  more on that here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_parliamentary_election,_2013 . 
  public outrage reached its height after the appointment of delyan peevski , ** a very controversial ** political figure , as the head of dans - the bulgarian state security agency . 
  after the constitutional court allowed peevski to return to parliament , students occupied the sofia university , being followed several days later by universities accross the country . 
  more on that here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protests_against_the_oresharski_cabinet in more recent news , the socialist and * centrist * parties bsp and dps are shipping people from around the country by the busload to form counter-protests in favor on the current government .

  you 're making it too easy . 
  the problem with the dispute is that by maintaining their current stance on the matter ( not just the name ) , they 're sparkling very big controversies among academics regarding historical inaccuracies , which macedonians refer to as facts . 
  in bulgaria it is the turkish party pandering to them for years for their votes . 
  i 'll be very impressed if someone manages to dig up something that looks like an academic paper with another explanation . 
  some people have a hard time believing this . 
  if you are retired and do n't have a job or a family to take care of you , you pretty much barely have enough to eat . 
  people were really sad when he renounced his bulgarian citizenship . 
  but i am happy for him because he would have never made the best of his talents if he had n't left . 
  there are so many legends in sport who did not want to go further and stayed behind . 
  and i thought it was ancient aliens . 
  huh ... 
  long words make brain hurt . 
  me no like !, 
  no , you just somehow become a reckless driver and your chances of being in a car accident increase exponentially . 
  you are now on a watch list . 
  so one hour of working gets you a loaf of bread and a bus ticket ? 
  i think there 's an archive from / int / somewhere with all of them . 
  countries with bigger user bases have more variations . 
  2036 is right around the corner : , 
  it was supposed to be a joke and i suspect i 've spent much less time looking into the issue than you have . 
  thanks for the resources , i 'll check them out . 
  yeah , deaths by getting tangled up in a mosquito net rose by a million percent . 
  not to mention all those dangerous toilets people do n't know how to use and keep falling into . 
  twenty years `` africans bitching about chinese neo-colonialism '', 
  when i was in germany lots of people had really shitty routers that were ruining their speed . 
  hooking up to the modem directly got you 20 , but going through the router reduced it to 10 . 
  wow , that 's huge compared to sofia !, 
  mine is 60sq , 1 bedroom for 250euro/m and pretty far from the city center . 
  average for something decent is 200euro/m . 
  always thought that athens was expensive . 
  very impressed . 
  same reason why you do n't hear your friends talking about it . 
  they think it 's not important . 
  very surprisingly , people forget these things . 
  just talk to your average person about the early stages of the conflict , before isis and russia started playing major roles in it . 
  they say one of the blasts was his body bursting out of the mausoleum and hurling itself at the grand national assembly building . 
  that 's understandable . 
  it 's the same here . 
  we 've been doing this eu dance a couple of years now and people still think commission and parliament are two words for the same thing . 
  do n't worry , people will start trusting the commission a lot less when you join and see how it works . 
  those who keep up with the trend will benefit . 
  those that refuse to adapt will not . 
  the replies under this comment are gon na be interesting . 
   red bull first they drop people from the stratosphere and now this ? 
  [ we 're both kinda wrong . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/euro_banknotes#statistics ) looks like there are about 15 countries that print them . 
  still , there 's costs to the state . 
  state 's central bank has to report to ecb for oversight and cover transporting fresh new euro bills from the printing country 's central bank . 
  i 'm pretty sure they have to get from a to b in an armored vehicle , then be accounted for and then distributed to local banks , etc. 
  yeah , we save on conversion fees when making transactions . 
  but then there will be new costs with having euro bills imported because we ca n't print them here . 
  no one in their right mind will ever remove the peg , but i guess they said the same about britain leaving the eu . 
  they were indeed , not arguing with you . 
  i am only making a point about building up industry . 
  almost everything built at that time has now been abandoned , demolished , or sold off . 
  i do know that . 
  it was exactly because of technology from east germany and czechia that weaker states could catch up . 
  comecon nearly abolished intellectual property rights in 1949 . 
  this is what i refer to as ** acceleration ** of industrial development . 
  not trying to disprove anything else that has been said so far , but people here give them credit for contributing to the acceleration of industrial development in bulgaria . 
  we were never in cccp though, 
  i like how people in turkey are taught that they 're all high ranking government officials , while in bulgaria and romania we 're taught they were all slaves lol . 
  most unbiased sources show that slaves/officials were rare ends of both spectrums and the majority were just soldiers . 
  we are doing ** salty ** now . . why have n't you been paying attention ? 
  where do you guys find all these witches to burn each year ? 
  were n't we supposed to refer to the czech republic as czechia now by their request ? 
  guys , the title is a link to the thread that happened over at / r/iama . 
  thanks for clarifying that . 
  i was n't even going to click it before i read your comment . 
  yeah , i read your comment a second time and edited mine . 
  dealing with sales people all day here as well . 
  love it when i get calls regarding how they imagine some metrics should be interpreted and how statistics fails to recognize their potential . 
  i think their head of marketing was equally pleased with both of them, 
  i think there is a misunderstanding on my part regarding different forms of headscarves . 
  this is what my grandma wears : http://novinar.bg/data/2010-04-10/20100407_0118.jpg, 
  my grandma puts one on when shes in the garden and her hair gets messy . 
  she 's done that for 50 years . 
  guess we 'll have to buy her a government approved extra christian hair net \u00ae, 
  as far as coke , every country has the same stuff . 
  you 'll know exactly when you 've hit the jackpot when you do line and it does n't leave a pharmacy smell in your nostrils . 
  there 's nothing about this image that i do n't love http://i.imgur.com/w2byebt.png, 
  sure you can , but you will need a plan . 
  first step ... what are you gon na do with all the mexicans ? 
  i 'm 1.60 and going to maastricht for me was like stepping into narnia . 
  dutch girls also were n't super into me wanting to climb up them btw, 
  stay here , russia will be coming to us soon : ^ ), 
  meanwhile , bulgaria is actually trying to get there, 
  touch\u00e9, 
  i completely agree with you . 
  restoring these buildings , which some are already at least a hundred years old , would have been a beautiful sight .
