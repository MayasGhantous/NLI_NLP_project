  it will be great . 
  just think about is all i 'm saying , ok ? 
   there has been a little discussion on time to time that we should make finlandia for our national hymn . 
  you definitely should . 
  finlandia is one of the best pieces of classical music i 've listened . 
  that and sibelius ' 4th symphony . 
  clearly you 've never had the dubious honour of reading the garbage most of the bulgarian media spews on a daily basis . 
  as far as i know the third energy package is applied on onshore infrastructure . 
  blackmailed ? 
  south stream was in direct violation of the eu 's third energy package . 
  meaning that companies building pipes on eu territory no longer have monopoly on said pipes . 
  gazprom being the unique and special snowflake that it is , was of course against said rule and instead forced a new law via our idiotic socialist government that tried to change the status of the pipes to some bullshit . 
  the whole thing was corrupt . 
  it was 4 + billion euros we do n't have for 500 km of pipes in bulgaria , for what ? 
  the promise that maybe sometime in 10 years we would perhaps get transit fees on the condition that the pipe 's capacity was over 50 % ? 
  right , yeah , shrinking consumption of natural gas combined with russia 's lack of technological ability to transport said gas totally guarantees that our local useful idiots would have to scramble for even dumber and more moronic ideas as to how to blame the us and eu and nato and whatever for every stupid decision they themselves make . 
  fuck that . 
  putin cancelling south stream was the best thing that happened to this country in recent years . 
  about time  . 
  the us should definitely consider sending more tanks over here just to troll the crap out of our local pro-russian traitors . 
  from a maple tree i think . 
  took my son out for a walk and some pigeon chasing , then he tried to eat a leaf . 
  it was glorious . 
  come to plovdiv , you 'll love our no wind feels-like-you 're - standing-in-an-oven summers . 
  we share a lot of history , a lot of culture , sibiu is beautiful . 
  romania has a strong it sector , is fighting corruption , sibiu is beautiful , i like the people , the carpathian mountains , the castles , the habsburg architecture and it is close enough i can drive back to bulgaria to visit relatives . 
  mostly because i do n't want my son growing up in a country content with nepotism , corruption and a ruling elite supportive of the status quo . 
  also i believe i mentioned that sibiu is beautiful . 
  as someone who is considering moving to romania - nah . 
  you guys are doing fine . 
  just keep jailing the corrupt assholes and as u/glennznl said in another 10 years or so and all those issues will be resolved . 
  why ? 
  did the us also capture an estonian security officer on estonian soil and then sentenced him in their home courts on fake charges ? 
  also you do know that we do n't have a land border with the us , right ? 
  furthermore most of the eu countries are part of nato and thus allies . 
  on the economic side we would lose a lot more by cutting trade with the us than russia , since most of the us 's exports are manufactured goods , whereas the only thing we get from russia are raw materials , which can be bought elsewhere . 
  thanks for the link . 
  will give it a look . 
  of course . 
  ice wall guarded by the night watch ... errrm ... nato is what i meant . 
  it 's things like these that make me wish we would cut all diplomatic and economical relations with russia and build a giant fucking wall on the land borders . 
  as soon as they reset their calendar to dear leader 's age . 
  russia is fast on track on reaching north korea levels of autocratic idiocy . 
  bulgarian football has been garbage for a long time . 
  that is assuming the us considers russia as a potential or valid rival at all . 
  which , judging by russia 's gdp , i would say is highly improbable . 
  he is tied with barekov , who is , as we all know levski 2.0 . 
  did n't they disintegrate , i have n't been following recent events as much ? 
  even before that i would hardly call them a party at all . 
  their platform was nonexistent , just random bullshit proclamations and barekov describing himself as the new levski . 
  so umm ... 
  i guess i would say their alignment leans more towards oligarchic idiots rather than the conventional left-right political spectrum . 
  thanks for reminding me of that interview btw . 
  recently i did n't have much reason to facepalm at anything other than posts from r/niceguys , now i feel is a good time to relive some nostalgia starting from that and then moving into `` sometime win , sometime lun '' territory . 
  from left to right : ** socialists ** - the communists after rebranding themselves in 1990 . 
  second biggest party , though rapidly declining in number . 
  a highly corrupt , economically incompetent and feudal group with a strong tendency to do whatever the russians say . 
  ** abv ** - sixth biggest party . 
  same as above ** gerb ** - center-right . 
  biggest and current ruling party formed by our former communist dictator 's bodyguard . 
  corrupt , populist , lacking in any strong opinions . 
  our glorious pm has an ego the size of the country , has expressed admiration for orban and putin , but in reality will do whatever merkel and company say ( and thank god for that ) . 
  sort of pro eu and nato . 
  ** reformist bloc ** - a loose coalition of right and center parties . 
  fourth biggest party and a minority member of the government . 
  not as corrupt , anti-communists who are pro eu and nato . 
  ** dps ** - pretend liberals . 
  third biggest party . 
  former communists , now turned oligarchs , they own most of the media in bulgaria . 
  they buy most of the gypsy vote here . 
  ** patriotic front ** - a coalition of two nationalist parties . 
  fifth biggest party . 
  minority member of the government . 
  kind of two faced , with one side being pro eu and nato while the other is a russophilic circle jerk . 
  ** ataka ** - russian nationalist party masquerading as a bulgarian nationalist party . 
  smallest party in parlament , has neo-nazi tendencies . 
  financed by russia with an impressively xenophobic attitude to to whatever russia says . 
  can confirm . 
  a few years back i parked and locked my bike on a fence 5m from my university 15 minutes later it was gone . 
  psh ... we recently replaced guard dogs with polar bears . 
  greece is so far south it can practically into nordic . 
  that would explain all the penguins in my backyard . 
  out of all the social media sites which popped out in the last 10 years twitter is the one i find most perplexing . 
  you have a 140 char limit and ca n't string a decent sentence together . 
  and then there is this hashtag bullshit . 
  i mean , what is the appeal ? 
  oh well i 've been thinking of buying a leica laser ruler for a while . 
  i guess now is a good time to do it . 
  here , have an upvote you statist kiwi you . 
  i would hazzard to guess the weapons were intended to be delivered to the [ free syrian army ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_syrian_army ), 
  i do n't think he really cares about facts . 
  considering that , based on data from 2014 , bulgarian exports to russia were about 2.5 % of our total export income of which only a fraction is composed of agricultural products , i would say the effect of the russian imposed embargo on us has minimal to no effect . 
  our biggest export partner is naturaly the other eu countries with a combined total of over 60 % followed by turkey with around 8.6 % our local communist and pseudo-nationalists tend to inflate how important russia is to bulgaria when in reality excluding our reliance on gas there really is n't that much going on in terms of trade . 
  because we are totally the ones responsible for them starting a war against ukraine , the rouble losing half its value and their travel agencies going bankrupt . 
  thank you turkey for delicious kebap and efes beer and for all the great moments i had in istanbul , izmir and mersin . 
  thank you greece for delicious kebap ... umm . . gyros . 
  oh and for the lovely islands , good resorts and cultural heritage . 
  i hope you guys will get back on your feet soon . 
  thank you romania for the way you 've been clamping down on corruption recently . 
  can you send a few thousand of your prosecuters down here ?
