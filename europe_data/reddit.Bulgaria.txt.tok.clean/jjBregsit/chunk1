  no english sources for that . 
  basically commies wanted to control every aspect and decided to assimilate romas into bulgarians , by splitting them from turks . 
  this went on after 1962 and they were pretty successful in splitting them , but failed integrating them . 
  so romas remained the same just switchted religions a lot and were pretty atheistic . 
  besides we have like 3 groups of romas one is christian , the second muslim and the third whatever they feel like . 
  no they did n't . 
  i grew up in a city that had about 10-15 % roma population . 
  they were either completely atheist or christian , usually anarchic . 
  they started brainwashing them 20 years ago by telling them that a roma has to be muslim , to get votes . 
  / u/isnortedapencilonce is completely right for the roma here . 
  it is like you people have no grasp what communism did here . 
  for the first years they forbid every kind of religion . 
  sure people did n't throw them away but in the end when they reinstated religion people were very secular/atheist . 
  even our local muslims are nothing like the muslim of the middle east . 
  not because of some made up secularism but because the commies beat every single religion into the ground for a good quarter of the century . 
  edit : and just for the sake of it it is n't a `` turkish '' party . 
  it was a russian/turkish party formed of the ex soviet agents of turkish decent . 
  now after the recent clash between them they have split the party . 
  russian tried to control all sides of the parliament here : the socialist ( bsp ) , the nationalists ( ataka ) , and the minority vote ( drf ) . 
  on the last one they also had to cooperate with turkey . 
  just following western example : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swiss_minaret_referendum,_2009 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_ban_on_face_covering http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/622037/switzerland-votes-burqa-ban-fine-muslim-women burkas are not native to the muslim population here . 
  they are very recent with the rise of the saudi sponsorships of the local imams .

  you are making a demagogic argument of the type `` i have heard this many years ago '' . 
  i cant verify what the grandfathers of some kids said 35 years ago . 
  and i actually gave you the benefit of the doubt . 
  so i am going to repeat myself . 
  if you are correct . 
  and if as you said they `` died out without passing on their movement '' . 
  does n't this make the law obsolete now ? 
  should it be removed ? 
  or are germans a nation never to be trusted again ? 
  even if we assume that all of that is factual and not fiction :  their voices were simply banished from the public discourse so that they would die out without passing on their movement to a new generation . 
  so the law is obsolete ? 
  and if so it should be removed now ? 
  this is blatant fear-mongering . 
  the reason for the calmness in de was n't the bullshit anti free speech laws . 
  the reason was education of nazi atrocities , the immense blood spilled and the in group shaming of racist rhetoric . 
   or up to 5 even the possibility of it happening is baffling to me . 
   also , it is not about politically correctness . 
  the criminal offence is to incite hatred . 
  it is very much about correctness . 
  we can see how it is used and it definitely is used to reinforce it . 
   but if you do it in a forum where you know people are open for your suggestion , are willingly to suck everything up to fuel their believes , to help their minds to go to action , than it is incitment . 
  and that is what he did . 
  so a huge portion of the muslims should be in jail for promoting jihad and hatred towards germans ? 
  why are n't they there ? 
  this is the issue with laws like this , they are used for policing only a certain type of speech that is inconvenient to the current government . 
  tbh at the moment , it is calmer here . 
  under : promoted stories : how russia defeats nato . 
  does europe need a new warsaw pact . 
  and some gold from one of the authors : essential reading for the apocalypse what kind of site is that ? 
  i have and it really depends . 
  knifes and brass knuckles are ubiquitous around the disco clubs here . 
  getting into a fight with someone having one of those and taking even one hit can be life changing . 
  martial arts as they are right now are mainly for sports , real fights are nothing like the 1vs1 they teach you there . 
   i stand corrected , the source says balkans , not bulgaria . 
  still , your claim that the muslim expulsion happened decades later than the post at hand ( 1876 ) is painfully incorrect . 
  are you really going to deny the happenings in the turco-russian war in 1876 ? 
  i never made such claim . 
  you are confusing me with / u/szkwarek . 
  bulgarians never committed atrocities against the turkish population during the russian-turkish war . 
  even the glorified harmanli massacre which according to both sides looks like : `` based on the russian version of the events , upon approaching the column , the russian forces were shot at by turks hiding behind carts . 
  during the turks ' flight , some of them encountered and burnt down the christian village devraliy . 
  based on the turkish version of the events , the column was attacked by russian troops . 
  the column broke up and dispersed , the able-bodied portion of the caravan fled toward the mountains , the old , the sick and the very young who were left behind perished in the freezing weather . '', 
  was committed allegedly by russians . 
  also when he says decades i believe he points to the revival process of the commies , which while being actual oppression is not a massacre . 
   again , i never denied that massacres did n't occur . 
  i 'm just saying at the same time , bulgarians also massacred/forced to relocate the muslim civilian population . 
  again , i 'm referring to the war i 've mentioned before . 
  as a matter of fact , my great grandparents are bulgarian turkish immigrants that were forced to relocate . 
  relocations yes i believe there were . 
  every war leads to those , but massacres committed by bulgarian opulchenie were nonexistent . 
  at that time we lived with muslims for about 500 years , everybody had at least known muslim people ( there were also quite a few bulgarian muslims - pomaks ) . 
  the hate was at the ruling elite predominantly ( which ofc were turks ) . 
   and there is , i cited them . 
  you can check them all , the 're freely available in the form of e-books so you can check them and see if i 'm bullshitting or not . 
  i do n't see sources of the massacres , while i have even provided pictures ? 
  the two books you linked are to known revisionist that have produced almost nothing but pro islamic books . 
  anton is actually a known anti-bulgarian writer ( i think the commies mistreated his family ) which has an islamic studies degree . 
   while there must 've been coercion - no doubt - the coercion was limited . 
  scholars agree that a great extent of the islamization process was in fact voluntary - you had whole families converting due to reasons such as prestige . 
  here is an example : what scholars ? 
  known pro islamic western scholars and muslims . 
  there is not a single christian country at the balkans that is saying people were thrilled about getting their child abducted . 
  janissaries were very oftenly used to burn down rebellions in their own cities of origin as a test and they were n't allowed to reconnect with their families . 
  do you honestly believe mothers were giving their children willingly especially at that young age ? 
  the bulk of the muslim population was created in the first 100 years as a good strategy of keeping the food producing lands stable and under ottoman control . 
  and you can very much see it from the map i linked : dobrudja and trakija ( huge flat lands with fertile soil even today ) have a high muslim population , while mountain regions ( even with huge populations like sofia ) have a very low muslim population simply because they are not needed to the empire . 
  this was a great strategy by the turkish administration . 
  if it was really a natural push you would expect it to occur evenly across the country . 
   so what exactly in my post do you think is false ? 
  i admit that i 've written bulgaria instead of the balkans - i 've fixed that now . 
  but otherwise , all my points remain and are i believe valid . 
  see , i 'm again saying that i recognize all the wrong doings of the ottoman empire . 
  all i 'm expecting of you is to recognize the wrong doings of bulgarians too . 
  which is admirable , admitting mistakes . 
  what do you want me to recognize ?
