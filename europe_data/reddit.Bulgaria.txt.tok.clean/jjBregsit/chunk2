  that there were murdered turks by bulgarians during the 1878 war ? 
  of course there were . 
  but there were no systematic massacres of turkish population ordered by military officials . 
  for the entirety of the balkans 750\u043a displaced and 200000 killed ( including soldiers ) seems a little too high but plausible . 
  the balkans had a combined population 8 millions . 
  while i never took the time to investigate the number of turks in greece and serbia i highly doubt the half of 1,5 millions estimate ( even by your own sources it is said that it is the highest estimate - range is 100k to 750k ) . 
  i can agree with that happening , 750k displaced for the liberation of 3 different countries and 2 followup wars is def not impossible . 
  the issue with arguing about displaced and population is that the ottoman made no population counts at that time . 
  the first count occured after the war so everything about total populations at this time before the war is a guessing game . 
   and about the turkish history books - why exactly do you think they would make english turkish books ? 
  doubt they exist . 
  either way , there is n't massive propaganda like you seem to imply . 
  the fall of the ottomans is n't something that we went into in detail , it 's mostly the turkish war of independence following ww1 that had a big part in our curriculum . 
  i do n't imply anything i just want to read how we are portrayed there . 
  i get the impression that for bulgarians it is mentioned that we have turk roots relating to the proto-bulgarians and we were predominantly accepting islam on our own . 
  i would also guess that the rebellions in bulgaria were not exactly numbered ? 
  i would presume the talk is mainly about the late 1800s uprisings being related to the russian aggression against the ottomans . 
  here is a decent list with our uprisings : https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%d0%9a%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b5%d0%b3%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f:%d0%91%d1%8a%d0%bb%d0%b3%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8_%d0%b2%d1%8a%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d1%81%d1%80%d0%b5%d1%89%d1%83_%d0%9e%d1%81%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b0%d1%82%d0%b0_%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%bf%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%8f for example turks and muslims are not portrayed as inherently bad people in our books ( while we still learn of the poets of that period and their poems of `` fighting against the oppressive ruler '' . 
  it was actually quite normal when i was growing up to have at least one turkish kid in class and to be honest i have never felt resentment towards them growing up and learning about it . 
  but then again i grew up in one of the regions that are today said to have a big turkish population ) . 
  the ottomans are portrayed as conquerors and there is emphasis on the blood tax . 
  we actually are not taught a lot of the stara zagora massacres at school , just that it happened and numbers with a few pictures . 
  batak is in the focus however , but it is acknowledged that it was ordered by turkish generals while actually committed by bashibozuk ( unregular ) and not regular turkish army . 
  i actually do n't like the word slavery for that period , we have a special word that vazov coined here that i believe represents it justly , it just does n't have an english alternative '' \u0438\u0433\u043e '' ( some translators will still turn it to slavery but it is n't ) . 
  overall about the slavery our books seem to be factual as long as i have checked them . 
  the commies were lying about the period between the 1878 and 1945 since those years were where we had a western `` king '' and were very much against russia . 
  the war of 1885 with the serbs was very much provoked by the russians , since then our relationships soured tremendiosly . 
  we fought in both ww1 and ww2 against them ( ww1 with the ottomans on our side ) . 
  if that does n't prove that our relationships with them sucked at that time i do n't know what does . 
  so i should look at my russian books about the period and see what they say , since they were both against the ottomans and us . 
  edit : here is a very good source of the end of the second balkan war and some of the aftermaths . 
  http://www.promacedonia.org/bmark/lm_tr/lm_tr_3a.htm unfortunately it is directly taken from an old book from 1913 and is in some form of old bulgarian ( i doubt google translate would work ) : \u0420\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0463 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0463\u0437\u044a 1913 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u041b . \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0447\u044a, 
  i promised myself i wo n't get triggered by the revisionism of the ottoman empire in the last 20 years but i see these numbers every single time . 
  [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_turks ) is the wiki page for the bulgarian-turk , that we here consider as propaganda ( meaning we believe it is embellished and over estimated a lot it contains all your sources and numbers ) . 
  here is just one example of their lies : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/bulgaria_%28ethnic%29_1892.jpg this image is used with the text : `` ethnic map of bulgaria according to the census results from 1892 ( pink denotes regions with bulgarian and turkish population ) '' . 
  it seems to imply that all pink zones are predominantly turkish , but when you do the math on them the turkish population in all of bulgaria is equal to 170,500 people ( an independent german source , which is even used for your own propaganda ) . 
  this is done 14 years after our independence war in which you and the wiki page claim 1,5 million muslims were displaced and 200000 killed . 
  now lets go back to the media : during the war and during the april 's uprising ( which pretty much made the west aware of our plight ) there were 2 extremely famous massacres : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batak_massacre https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=de&amp;sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bgnow.eu%2fnews.php%3fcat%3d2%26cp%3d0%26newsid%3d38998 https://anonybulgaria.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/1004065_407246226062820_1748631202_n.jpg?w=700&amp;h=439 ( it reads : memories from stara zagora ; 1877-1902 by the monument of colonel kalitina ; bones from the massacre ) these two events were blown all over europe and reported on by all foreign media . 
  without them the west would have not allowed russia to intervene . 
  and i want you to look at the numbers : around 5000 killed at batak and around 14000 at stara zagora . 
  now go back to the german map and see that this is close to 15 % for batak and about 30 % for stara zagora . 
  imagine removing 200000 civil turkish population , the uproar of the west would be tremendious . 
  and this is a time when britain was in good relationships with the ottomans . 
  if there were literally slaughters of muslims during the war there would be notable sources before the last 20-25 years when all of this revisionist bullshit started . 
  the commies had propaganda majorly about 1000s and simeon . 
  they saw that as the highest point of our history and wanted it to sound way grander than it was . 
  they made him to be some kind of glorious conqueror of byzantium in those times ( which is a huge over estimation ) . 
  but they did n't need to lie about the turksh slavery , simply because it is exactly as the guy above you said . 
  hell even our most renown national hero [ levski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vasil_levski ) ( who was executed by the turks ) was for creating a country where both christians and muslims can live . 
  there was no genocide and systematic slaughter of turkish population during the uprising . 
  they killed a lot of army , they killed a lot of the governing elite . 
  even today you can still see that most of the same territories in central dobrudja and south bulgaria that had a lot of turkish people still have majority of turkish population . 
  edit : i am actually really curious to read an english version of the current turkish history books for 5th and 8th grade . 
  do you have a link to such or a place where i can buy them ? 
  i am relaying to the fact that they managed to write 120 pages about a 19 year old . 
  what is there so much write about ? 
  i highly doubt it was a `` thoughts and feelings about everything on facebook , twitter etc '' . 
  i have never heard of such practice here with the socialistic youth when i was young . 
  nobody collected so many information about them even if it was written by the kids . 
  are those 120 pages of pledges of some kind of allegiance ? 
  at least here everyone was required to write positive and report to the party representatives . 
  was it different in germany ? 
  how is that even possible ? 
  as it should be . 
  it is very easy for people in power to demand policing of laws , while for the average joe he would have to go trough a hefty and expensive court system . 
   between poland and lithuania . 
  russia go home !, 
  the first thing to do would be for nato to blockade the kaliningrad port . 
  i ca n't even . 
   they could be bribed to give up citizenship and move to another country though is n't that what hitler did before ww2 ? 
  edit : i do n't know why i am being downvoted since this is what happened : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haavara_agreement, 
  the cat is already out of the bag but here are my 10 cents as much as nobody wants them : loosening the restrictions on work permits and travel for bg and ro managed to transfer a lot of our work force to the west . 
  however as of recently i have noticed most of my educated friends are back home . 
  the ones working less technical jobs remain still in the west . 
  also a huge load of our gypsies went to sweden to beg for money creating `` begging mafia '' and sending huge loads of cash back to their families here ( which is good for us ? ) . 
  what should have been done a few years ago was a gradually allow our citizens to work in eu countries that have relatively close gdp per capita as us . 
  for example no restrictions on romanians and bulgarians working in each others country ( which we almost have right now and i have almost exclusively good relationships working with romanians here ) . 
  then as our gdp per capita start to close to some european nations we should have been allowed to freely work/travel there . 
  the way things are right now we lost a huge chunk of our populations ( and are still losing ) . 
  the main positive outcome of this free flow was that us and ro have probably the best relationships we have had for the last 100 years . 
  we will see how things progress . 
  tbh as stupid as it is to dox yourself on some random internet forum , he did follow through . 
  what specific new laws are breaking this european directive ? 
  it seems to be related to human rights . 
  what law did the government pass ? 
  what discrimination specifically is going on there ? 
   no one even uttered a word of complain about the previous government routinely ignoring the constitutional tribunal rulings . 
  can you give some examples ? 
  i honestly do n't know . 
  i guess you are right . 
  but can you really blame me ? 
  in his later comments he said we should be thankful to the ottomans for not slaughtering us completely and just conquering us . 
  if that is not a reason to get angry i do n't know what is . 
  anyway i agree this is against the rules . 
  i will stop . 
   you 're from bulgaria , a nation and empire that was founded by turks and converted to christianity . 
  do n't try educate me on my history , i know it quite well . 
  there is no clear consensus of the proto bulgariasn whether they were hunic or turko-altaic , but it is most likely they were at least descendants to turks . 
  all that there is consensus is that they lived on the eastern side of the black sea where they had formed a `` country '' . 
  at the balkans they formed an alliance with the local slavic tribes and together defeated the byzantians to form the nation today known as bulgaria .
