  but not really relevant to the statistic . 
  31 % are left for that . 
  how is it not relevant ? 
  mrf was sponsored by russia and turkey until the recent developments . 
  now they have split the party . 
  from this moment mrf will remain as russian backed and mestan ( former leader ) will [ create ] ( http://pik.bg/%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80%d1%86%d0%b8%d1%8f-%d1%81%d0%bf%d0%be%d0%bd%d1%81%d0%be%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%b0-%d0%bf%d0%b0%d1%80%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%8f%d1%82%d0%b0-%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b0%d0%bd-%d1%81-20-%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%b8%d0%be%d0%bd%d0%b0-%d0%b4%d0%be%d0%bb%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b0-news486765.html ) a new party backed by turkey . 
  the same way some of our local parties are sponsored by turkey . 
  it should be considered but it is n't .

  what is going on here . 
  for the last half an year i have been actually thinking this refugee crisis is a blessing in disguise . 
  europe will come out stronger from it . 
  you sound like a rabid anarchist . 
  it is not the fault of the dog if a stupid father is bringing his 3 year old child on foot doing illegal actions . 
  is the image of lawlessness what europe wants to project ? 
  where all regular migration processes are ignored and people are simply allowed to storm in ? 
  what is the point in having them ? 
  how will you feel if you migrate legally and then in 1 year watch as the full shit hole of greedy idiots decide to simply hop the fence ignore all of the rules you played by and worked your ass to pass , and get special treatment ? 
  oh , piss off . 
  their parents should n't be so stupid to illegally cross borders and put their kids in danger . 
  this is the age of 0 personal responsibility . 
  no u, 
   and very little white . 
  should n't progressives/socialists not shame based on race ? 
  balkans are relatively diverse , although most people are pretty slavic . 
  but it 's not like i can convince you of that without showing you around . 
   which is why they must feel super embarassed when even the poorest refugees absolutely reject the idea of staying there . 
  no we do n't . 
  we do n't live to prove to the west that we are some kind of moral authority . 
  we just want to be left alone for once in the past 600 years . 
  besides what sane refugee is going to want to stay here with no government handouts , population that very much dislikes them and a language that is neither close to theirs , nor to english . 
  especially when you consider the extreme handouts offered by the progressive west . 
  your shaming does n't work here man . 
  go back to your nice bubble and stay out of our job . 
  we might have 99 problems but a refugee ai n't one . 
  nope . 
  we just have 0 white guilt . 
  especially the balkans . 
  also people are pretty patriotic around here . 
  even most of the hippies . 
  bleeding hearts are for those that can afford them . 
  the balkans ca n't . 
   i was talking about possible solutions and not what you might consider the most plausible solution . 
  the world has a funny way of not reacting as you might expect it to do . 
  example ? 
  yes , some phd in social sciences would be perfect !, 
  do you claim that this will not happen ? 
  irrelevant !, 
  we are talking about what should be done , and trying to make it possible !, 
  do you claim that it will not work ? 
  hmm , interesting , though i would disagree . 
  there are other countries as examples , you could take look there and , perhaps , try and reproduce what you need . 
  this sounds so smug . 
  do you read after you type something ? 
   do you claim that this will not happen ? 
  irrelevant !, 
  people actually talk like this ? 
   most ter rorists do know a valuable skill . 
  shit , some of them finished or were studying in universities of the uk . 
  if you consider studying in universities does not offer a valuable skill , ok , we disagree . 
  putting words in my mouth with the last sentence . 
  my point was obviously towards those that are not but you make a good argument . 
  if they are educated what more can you teach them ? 
  they sure have a decent understanding of the laws and morals of the society they live in . 
  most of the officers in the nazi army were very intelligent ( past 120 iq some even 140 + ) . 
  how can you reason with an intelligent man that has come to a realization of that sort ? 
  you are going to get him in an argument that he had n't had before ? 
  have you spoken to a truly devout mulsim ? 
  that believes the koran is as is and should be taken literally ? 
  i 've had the displeasure . 
  he always had an answer to justify his belief . 
   really ? 
  in an article concerning uk government and uk islamic terroists ? 
  do uks criminals wear union-jack bandanas ? 
  and why us ? 
  why did n't you mention the mentality of drug offenders in northern albania ? 
  would n't that be equally relevant ? 
  there are other countries as examples , you could take look there and , perhaps , try and reproduce what you need . 
  because it is very relevant . 
  if a group of people develop a different cultural and ethical norm they can justify a lot . 
  for example msulims do n't view some crimes ( like sex with sub 16 girls ) like the west . 
  would you think they would condemn someone that marries a 12 year old girl , or would they condemn the government for throwing him in jail for that ? 
  it is exactly the same . 
  crime and evil are relative to culture . 
   but , in this specific case , probably you are right . 
  you are not a terrorist and you know a skill and you have never been convicted ( i suppose ) and yet you are so close-minded concerning education , law and political change , that i can not expect anything from trying to deal with terrorists . 
  again you sound smug . 
  if you think education is the cure to the worlds problems you have to meet people out of your bubble . 
  people are not inherently good gems waiting to be polished by education , and then simply put in the right way . 
  you are delusional . 
  and who do you think is going to go there and try to educate them ? 
  some ph.d. in social science ? 
   creates the idea of `` some bimbo put there to educate them '' is the reason why `` education in prison '' should be done ( and be taken ) no it is n't . 
  and i do take education in prisons seriously just not the kind you think of . 
  they should be taught a valuable skill - carpentry , welding , plumbing during their time so they can find a job once they are out if they prove they deserve the education . 
  you ca n't simply put a recidivist in a classroom , tell him not all muslim beliefs are good and expect him to say `` hey , i have been blind '' . 
  edit :  i would respect a guy who does not end up with me inside again . 
  there is literally a whole fucking system in american ghettos of the so called street credit for people going to prison . 
  the more you spend there the more you are perceived as superior . 
  you are simply ignorant to human nature .
