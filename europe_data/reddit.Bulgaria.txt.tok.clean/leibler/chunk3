  `` hey guys , wan na go to dublin for new years ? '' . 
  5 minutes later we had a flight and hotel booked . 
  yeah , beat that mum , i dare you . 
  on the subject of racism , being from eastern europe , i do n't really pay much attention to it - not like we do n't have plenty of neo nazis walking around . 
  here , they are practically harmless to europeans . 
  so the experience these guys had in vienna would n't bother me at all - seen it way too many times . 
  i do n't agree with it but it 's a common occurrence . 
  i 've been to 24 of the eu member states and i 've never felt unsafe or insecure . 
  with a grain of salt here because these days i 'd be scared to go to the uk for a few obvious reasons . 
  edit : typo . 
  can confirm but bare in mind that hating the capital is a common thing : french people hate paris , germans hate berlin and so on . 
  several weeks ago i was in varna and while i 'm a very kind and polite driver ( giving way , pedestrians are top priority and so on ) , i was shocked how arrogant drivers became when they saw my `` cb '' plates ( to those that are confused c , ca and cb are licence plates from sofia ), 
  it all boils down to walls .

  absolutely , they are all lovely . 
  i was in portugal with my girlfriend and we rented a car but the navigation was shit and we got lost in a village in the middle of nowhere . 
  we asked some guy which looked promising if he spoke english : `` no . 
  stop ! '', 
  then he pulled out his phone and called some friend of his who did and put it on speaker . 
  i was actually a bit uncomfortable , seeing how helpful they were for no reason . 
  we have that word too but i feel like it 's less commonly used ( among younger people at least ) . 
  oh i 'm pretty happy with that word to be honest . 
  i 'm pretty sure macedonians would come up with a different word for beer if we were to start using it . 
  in my 29 years on this planet and 25 of those in bulgaria , i have n't heard the word `` pivo '' once in real life . 
  a fairly recent craft beer came out that contains the word in it 's name but that does n't count .

  run ~ ~ forest ~ ~ eddie , run . 
  chasing someone in high heels is impressive . 
  on the surface maybe . 
  blow away the few dust particles and it becomes a very different story . 
  the people feel unrepresented and whether the rest like it or not , they do have a point . 
  uk is perhaps the place where this is most obvious - few of them voted tories , even fewer voted leave . 
  i did want the uk to leave because , much like many other pro-eu people , i was sick of the attitude . 
  honestly - there is a blog section in the eu 's website for fact checking dedicated entirely to the british press . 
  the fact that this is a necessity says more than enough . 
  those who are protesting now have their entire lives ahead of them and they are vastly unrepresented . 
  the simple fact is the people who voted to stay are those who will live with the consequences of this vote the longest . 
  what 's more a large portion of the voters had no idea what they were voting for - in favour/against immigration , in favour/against cameron , in favour/against brown people entering the uk and the list can go on forever . 
  it does beg the question - how many people really knew what they were voting for ? 
  both leave and remain . 
  as a spectator it is fun to watch but on a fundamental level i understand this protest completely . 
  noooooooooooo !, 
  one of the few people who understood the real situation in the world and contradicted the whole `` omg we are so miserable , everything is going to shit , the middle ages were so much better '' . 
  let 's hope ola continues his legacy :(, 
  ehem ... my flat loan adds up to 90k atm . 
  i can only imagine what would happen if i do n't pay my mortgage a single month .

  [ to be fair , you 're successfully screwing your economy rather well without the help of the eu ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wa50ct8.png ), 
  and i just got [ this mail ] ( http://imgur.com/bmzgkbn ) from ryanair , that 's some good marketing right there . 
  yeah , well there are already switzerland , lichtenstein , luxembourg and ireland for that purpose . 
  that 's a big competition . 
  if it makes you feel better , seems like may does n't give a flying fuck about anyone in the uk . 
  either that or she 's completely retarded .

  weird , 4 pro , iirc , wo n't even take off under a certain temperature . 
  drone ? 
  if so , what kind ? 
  i mean djis are popular and i 'm willing to bet at least phantom 3 cause there is no fish eye effect but somehow flying in those temperatures does n't seem like a great idea to say the least . 
  so how ? 
  in short : nothing good . 
  forex traders must be having such a fun time right now , one way or another . 
  [ and a few minutes later this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/d9cf1cp.gif ), 
  you do n't know where the sausages came from i presume . 
  [ well well well ] ( https://youtu.be/1xusob6pazc?t=154 ), 
  let 's face it , the ~ ~ austria ~ ~ * australia * sign is a bit confusing . 
  overexaggerated . 
  here 's the simple math : my first job after graduating from university paid 700 $ / month dead . 
  which may not sound like a lot , especially considering that my rent was 250 a month , bills not included . 
  even so , i lived in a wonderful area , lived a nice life , could afford going out 2-3 times a month . 
  after gaining some experience and making a name for myself , things got dramatically better . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that for the average uni graduate , moving abroad makes little sense , other than collecting some life experience . 
  so it only makes sense for the true cream of the crop , where we 're talking 6 figures a year ( not so much for the money but rather to feed their ego ) . 
  i 've worked in 3 large companies so far and in the past 6 years the number of people that have left to look for a better life abroad is still a single digit . 
  that said , if i were to move abroad i 'd most likely look into germany - not that far from home , people are friendly and astonishingly down to earth , i 'd love to learn german , finding beer is easier than finding water . 
  i approve . 
  i 've tried mountain biking in winter and it 's the most fun i 've ever had . 
  that said , wearing a diaper is not an very bad idea . 
  well the capital was doomstadt which has the german suffix so by a distant relation austro-hungarian empire ? 
  nope , latveria is what you are thinking of which , according to the comics is somewhere between serbia , romania and hungary . 
  [ these two probably ] ( http://imgur.com/a/3ooa8 ) . 
  in all seriousness all pictures i 've taken in the last few years were done with a smartphone ( i know , i know ) . 
  it was n't until october when i decided to buy a dslr . 
  but i have n't been using it much due to too much work . 
  funny cause i 've blown over 2k $ on the camera , lenses , filters and whatnot and i 've barely made 80 photos so far . 
  [ yup ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdqbrm4w4sk ), 
  but the center of dresden is gorgeous .
