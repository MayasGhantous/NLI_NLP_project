being able to enter a country with a passport does not necessarily mean that you get the right to work there . 
   it was turkey that spearheaded the destruction of syria . 
  and france and the uk had no role in that ? 
  i remember watching a tv report in the beginning of the uprising , and the province of hatay was swarming with intelligence officials from those countries . 
  australia actually has visa free travel with all eu member states , so it will not be affected by this . 
  what a lovely song . 
   thereafter that israel is a zionist state is zionism not the founding ideology of the state of israel ? 
  yes , but if the state becomes more involved with the church , they could unwittingly increase the influence of the church on the state . 
  it is either arabic or latin . 
  i wonder what the native turkish word would have been for republic . 
  is that really the official name for hovercraft in turkish ? 
  sometimes you just have to pick your poison . 
  military mission gets attacked with guns . 
  is that not rather common ? 
  how is that news ? 
  better than having an isis supporter . 
   if we can say there 's a european normalized culture but there is no such thing . 
  sarkozy - the man who is mostly responsible for the utter mess that is now libya after a misguided attempt to export `` democracy '' - gives us his opinions about yet another country . 
  solar panels do not operate at 100 % efficiency . 
  the operating efficiency is typically around 10 % . 
  if you need 1 % of energy that falls on earth , that means you would have to cover 10 % of the surface of the planet with solar panels in order to capture that amount of energy . 
  solar energy alone would not be enough to power our civilization , though . 
  if we were to rely only on solar energy we would have to scale back our living standards significantly as they correlate closely with energy consumption . 
  his bombing clearly made it worse . 
   the very , very long period of storage needed much of that `` waste '' could actually be used as fuel in newer generation nuclear reactors . 
  the reason why so much of that `` waste '' is discarded , and not reused is because we have not updated nuclear reactor designs significantly since the 1960s when weinberg came up with the pressurized water reactor which remains the dominant reactor design to date . 
  imagine al qaeda supporters being allowed to pitch tents during the visit of a senior american official . 
  that 's how the pkk is seen in turkey . 
  a unified kurdish state never existed in history even before the establishment of the turkish republic . 
  despite all those risks you have mentioned , historically nuclear has been very safe . 
  if you look at the number of people killed per kwhr produced , nuclear ranks better than even solar and wind . 
  nuclear has only 90 deaths/trillionkwhr versus 440 and 150 for ( rooftop ) solar and wind respectively . 
  meanwhile the global everage for coal is 100,000 deaths per trillion kwhrs .

   gollum you mean smeagol . 
  it was argued in the turkish court that the pictures compared him to smeagol who was the good character , and not to gollum who was the evil one , and therefore did not amount to defamation . 
  that is the right way . 
  the only way to avoid massive co2 emissions and reduce global warming , is my shifting to non-carbon emitting source of energy . 
  nuclear , along with solar and wind , is one way of achieving that . 
  every time there is an atmosphere of good will between europe and turkey , this guy comes in with his recalcitrant speechces and poisons everything . 
  the turkish intervention in cyprus was legal under the treaty of guarantees of 1960 . 
   the republic of cyprus includes all cypriots . 
  if the greek cypriots administration was serious about representing all cypriots , at the very least it would follow the constitution of the republic that clearly requires the vice president to be turkish cypriot and reserves a certain number of seats in the house for turkish cypriot . 
  currently none of these provisions are respected . 
  the greek cypriot administration likes the rights that come with being considered the sole legal representative of the island , but avoids the responsibilities that come along with that status . 
   fyi , cyprus before invasion ( purple is turkish-cypriot enclaves ) i am sure greek nationalists would have preferred the turkish cypriots to be stuck in tiny enclaves and ghettos . 
  fortunately for the turkish cypriots , those days are long gone . 
  any viable solution would require a contiguous turkish cypriots components state with access to the sea . 
  greece which is west of turkey is in europe , ukraine which is north of turkey is in europe , armenia which is east of turkey is in europe , cyprus which is south of turkey is in europe . 
  however , somehow turkey is not in europe . 
  the issue with cyprus is quite simple . 
  turkey has no problem with recognizing the greek cypriot administration for what it is - a representative of the interest of the greek cypriots . 
  what turkey does not recognize are its claims to represent the turkish cypriots , and the whole island . 
   lesser bulgaria or western bulgaria calling macedonia that would be like calling denmark lesser sweden or western sweden, 
  is this the guy whose party was found to be involved in the massive spying scandal ? 
   even the most liberal or committed pluralist armenian would at this point not take anything less than a separation of nagorno-karabakh from azerbaijan and you would know that because ... ? 
  your veto does not really matter . 
  when the big powers in the eu want something , they usually find a way to do it . 
  / u/cametosaybla seems to be one of the most liberal turkish cypriots that i have ever come across , and you can not even agree with him . 
  i am just asking . 
  you said you were a turkish cypriot , so interested to hear your perspective . 
  you are not arguing in good faith . 
  you are misrepresenting , and avoid backing up your claims with evidence . 
  you are minimizing the ethnic cleansing of one side , while trying to extract maximum political dividend from the ethnic cleansing of the other . 
  and on top of that you are putting words in my mouth . 
  i never referred to greek cypriots as `` nasty '' . 
  that was your own statement . 
  but let me address as shortly as i can some of the more egregious errors in your statement above . 
   if you deliberately ignite a sectarian conflict by invasion and start committing massacres the inter-communal violence started long before any turkish soldier set foot on the island . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cypriot_intercommunal_violence  you can hardly expect cyprus to rule according to pluralist principles you can not have your cake and eat it too . 
  if you want to be treated as the sole legitimate government on the island , you need to act as one . 
  even more so when you are an eu member . 
   ethnically cleanse the island . 
  still no proof of this . 
  akritas plan eoka b nikos sampson threats , shootings and attempts of arson pushing people into tiny enclaves and ghettos, 
  the majority of turkish cypriots held property in the south before , right ? 
  are you able to reclaim your properties from the south ? 
  after the rejection of the annan plan , tony blair is reported to have said :  we must now act to end the isolation of northern cyprus . 
  that means lifting the sanctions on trade and travel . 
  that means also ensuring that eu funds currently available for dispersal are actually dispersed . 
  do you think if the isolation was lifted , that they drive for unification among turkish cypriots would be as strong ? 
  my impressions is that the desire for unification is driven mostly be people 's desire to escape the embargo and the accompanying economic difficulties . 
  you are repeating the talking points of president papadopolous , the late greek cypriot leader who called for the rejection of the unification plan . 
  he was a right wing nationalist , by the way . 
  unlike the right wing greek cypriot leader , the international opinion at the time was overwhelmingly in favor of the plan . 
  the eu , the un and virtually all member states expressed support for the deal . 
  wikipedia has a good summary here : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/annan_plan_for_cyprus#international_opinions the eu parliament even passed a resolution stating :  considers that this final document constitutes a historic compromise which would end one of the longest-running conflicts in europe and could serve as a shining example for handling equally difficult international issues ; considers that the final revised plan institutionalises a functional federal system of government which is able to ensure that a reunited cyprus can speak with one voice and fully play its role in the framework of the european institutions , and calls on all parties to fulfil their obligations with honesty and openness so much for your ridiculous assertion that cyprus would have no sovereignty under that plan . 
   separatism and ethnic cleansing should n't be ignored and the trnc should n't be treated like a sovereign and legal state when it is n't . 
  ethnic cleansing happened on both sides . 
  the republic of cyprus , whom the eu continues to regard as the legitimate authority , continues to ignore its own constitution , the founding document on which its own legitimacy is based , behaving effectively as a solely greek cypriot administration , while at the same time claiming to represent the entire island . 
  the constitutions drafted after the london and z\u00fcrich agreements , clearly requires that :  the constitution provided for under the agreements divided the cypriot people into two communities on the basis of ethnic origin . 
  the president had to be a greek-cypriot elected by the greek-cypriots , and ** the vice-president a turkish-cypriot elected by the turkish-cypriots ** . 
  the vice-president was granted the right of a final veto on laws passed by the house of representatives and on decisions of the council of ministers which was composed of ten ministers , three of whom ** had to be turkish-cypriots nominated by the vice-president ** . 
  in the house of representatives , the turkish cypriots were elected separately by their own community . 
  how many of those provisions are respected today ? 
  where is the turkish cypriot vice president , and where are the turkish cypriot members of the house of representatives ? 
  how many turkish cypriots who have also lost properties in the south have been allowed to reclaim them ? 
  on what basis has the republic of cyprus denied them their property rights ? 
   turkey not being allowed to continue an illegal occupation . 
  under the annan plan that the greeks rejected , the number of turkish soldiers would have been reduced to the symbolic 700 ( vs 900 mainland greek troops ) .
