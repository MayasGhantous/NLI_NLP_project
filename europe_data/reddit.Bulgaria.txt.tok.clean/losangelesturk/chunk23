  i find it hard to believe that he would let his party defend the interests of turkey . 
  and frankly what has dps ever done for the interests of the turkish minority in bulgaria ? 
  there are no turkish classes in school even in turkish majority cities like kardzhali , there has been no restoration of turkish names for towns that were changed under the communist regime ( such as momchilgrad which is called mastanli in turkish ) , no status for the turkish language in areas where there are turks , turkish can not even be used during election manifestations , really nothing . 
  at this pace even the kurds in turkey are getting more rights than us turks in bulgaria , whereas hungarians in romania are light years ahead . 
  city signs in turkey also show their population . 
  n\u00fcfus means population . 
   give them a finger and they 'll take a hand at least that 's the case with the muslim community in our country . 
  in the 80s bulgaria actually started something called the revival process , in which they essentially banned the turkish ethnicity , religion and culture , and attempted to forcefully assimilate all turks in the country . 
  people 's names were forcefully changed from turkish to bulgarian . 
  i do not see how there could be any comparison with the muslims in the netherlands , most of whom are probably recent immigrants . 
  muslims in bulgaria , on the other hand , are indigenous . 
  is there a reason for why they forced romania but did not do so for bulgaria ? 
  macedonia should be the next to join . 
  i think there are quite significant cultural differences between bulgaria and serbia . 
  first , the two countries had very different experiences during the cold war . 
  bulgaria fell on the soviet side of the iron curtain , whereas serbia was a part of yugoslavia that was neutral between the west and the soviet east . 
  also the violent breakup of yugoslavia ensured that nationalism and chauvinism are more widespread in serbia , than in bulgaria . 
   if the muslim community wants money for their religious activities , the state should provide for them . 
  full stop . 
  well , i agree with that , but in bulgaria the state has for the longest time ignored the needs of the muslim minority . 
  hardly any funds have been allocated for muslim places of worship or for the education of muslim religious figures . 
  had the bulgarian state actually met its responsibilities , there would have been no opportunity for foreign states to interfere . 
   unconstitutional by any reading of the bulgarian law the highest authority on the constitution , which is the constitutional court in bulgaria , already declared that dps as a party did not violate the constitution all the way back in 1992 . 
  so this argument about the constitutionality is really worn out . 
  and why should dps/mrf be considered unconstitutional in the first place , when other parties which are composed of 100 % ethnic bulgarians are never considered unconstitutional ? 
  the law can not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity , and if parties are banned because they are composed by a majority of ethnic turks , then parties that are composed by a majority of ethnic bulgarians should be banned as well . 
  the whole argument for banning dps/mrf is really an attempt to disenfranchise ethnic minorities in bulgaria and prevent them from having a meaningful voice in the governance of their country . 
  this is especially true because very few minorities participate in the other parties outside the dps , with the sole exception of perhaps the reformation block which has one or two turks in its midst . 
  as for dps being a conduit of turkish interests - frankly that is just propaganda . 
  after the downing the of the russian jet by turkey and the controversy that followed , it was clearly shown that the senior leadership of dps/mrf are subservient to state security and follow a heavily pro-russian agenda . 
  in fact , for all those years that it has existed , i can not think of a single positive thing that dps has done for the turkish minority . 
  i thought swiss referenda were binding . 
  the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
  i can understand both written and spoken equally well . 
  probably written slightly better than spoken . 
  what purpose does this really serve ? 
  does n't erdogan 's pr team realize that this only makes him look worse and worse in the eyes of europeans ? 
  or is that his objective ? 
  interesting , i can say i understand far more russian than say serbian or polish . 
  as for macedonian , i probably understand 95 % . 
  the holocaust is an undeniable historical fact that is extensively documented and there is clear systematically collected evidence for it . 
  not so much for the armenian genocide . 
  even the number that you quote is under dispute . 
  in 1912 , the armenian population in the six vilayets of the ottoman empire according to none other than the armenian patriarchate of constantinople was actually only 1.018 million . 
  it defies logic how 1.5 million could have been killed . 
  if that happens , 99 % of the political elite in bulgaria would be in prison . 
  the leadership of bsp recently laid some flowers to the monument of the late communist dictator , and even the pm borisov himself is on record condoning the communist regime of zhivkov . 
   1 +1 = 2 even that statement is not strictly speaking correct . 
  it all depends on the context . 
  in binary arithmetic , it is in fact the case that  1 + 1 = 0 where ' x + y ' is defined as ' ( x + y ) mod 2 ' . 
  if this law passes , then the first person they need to prosecute is their own president for denial of the algerian genocide . 
   commenting on remarks by french president francois hollande who has recently denied that his country committed genocide in algeria during the colonial period between 1830 and 1962 , minister of war veterans tayeb zaitoni told reporters : `` if france does not recognise its crimes in algeria today , it will do tomorrow . ''  `` we will carry the message of our victims from one generation to another and we 're proud of our ancestors , '' zaitouni added . 
   on tuesday , france 's canal + channel broadcasted a video in which hollande tells a french student of algerian origin : `` ** it was not genocide in algeria ** but a war which we recognise . ''  the student later interrupts the french president saying : `` no , but it was genocide , you killed algerians and tortured them . '' hollande replied : `` no , we did not want a genocide and did not want to kill the algerians . 
  indeed it was a very painful war and yes mass graves are being discovered till this day and we must recognise this , but definitely not genocide , because we did not want to kill all the people . '' source : https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20150424-algerian-minister-france-will-admit-to-its-crimes-in-algeria-sooner-or-later/, 
  spare me that nonsense about how great france is . 
  it has a terrible track record of facing up to its crimes , and constantly tries to white wash its history . 
  one example is how france has fought hard to conceal its own complicity in the rwandan genocide . 
  the new york times had extensive coverage of that here : [ claims of french complicity in rwanda 's genocide rekindle mutual resentment ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/world/africa/claims-of-french-complicity-in-rwandas-genocide-rekindle-mutual-resentment.html?_r=0 ) quoting the relevant part :  the acrimony between their political leaders centers on france 's role in the tragedy , which was thrust back into the open by sharp remarks from rwanda 's president , paul kagame , on the eve of somber ceremonies to mark the 1994 genocide . 
  france , he said , bore part of the responsibility for the carnage that killed more than 800,000 people , mostly members of the tutsi minority . 
   french political leaders responded defensively , canceling plans for the french justice minister to attend the commemoration and , in most cases , angrily denouncing mr. kagame 's assertions . 
  what might have been a moment to foster reconciliation between the two countries instead inflamed old resentments and illustrated how both nations still struggle to come to terms with the horrifying events two decades ago . 
  perhaps , you should face up to your own history first , rather than meddle in other country 's business . 
  you are so sure about what you are saying that you actually feel the need to imprison those that disagree with you . 
  that reeks of insecurity . 
  no , it is n't . 
  not gon na happen . 
  the senior leadership of the eu also supported the plan , as was the un . 
  i am sure they were all following a secret turkish agenda . 
  most of the world leaders declared at the time that the annan plan was a fair and balanced deal . 
  frankly , i doubt that the next plan would be any different . 
  to me that smacks of a european superiority complex . 
  the superior french parliament thinks that it has the right to dictate to other nations what happened in their history , and if the natives dare so much but disagree , then they are instantly banned , fined , and jailed . 
  how dare you disagree with what we say happened in your history ? 
  and when the french parliament says that `` 1 +1 = 3 '' we should all believe it ? 
  this reminds me of a case in the us where a local legislative council passed a law that `` pi = 3 '' to make things simpler and all the citizens were forced to follow it . 
  and what happens when it is the french parliament that is promoting false historical facts ? 
  do they have the sole monopoly on deciding what happened and what did not happen in history ? 
  does something become historical fact just because your parliament says so ? 
  truth can only be reached through open and free debate , not through restrictions on free speech . 
  actually some jewish historians have expressed the opinion that genocide/holocaust denial laws are harmful . 
  punishing free speech only turns the denier into a martyr in the eyes of his supporters , and further entrenches their positions . 
  these laws also undermine free speech and open academic discourse . 
  what if somebody does not deny entire genocide narrative , but disputes a certain detail or a small historical aspect , and say publishes an academic paper with their findings ? 
  if those findings disagree with the official position , would they by liable under this law ? 
  and are in a state of war with your closest ally . 
  so when there were accusations about how he is held by the `` shlifer '' , did the accusers actually imply these murders ? 
  that 's interesting . 
  i did not know he was actually linked to murders . 
  then how come countries like switzerland and sweden have cheap transfers to and from the eurozone even though they are outside ? 
  to be honest , it seems that bulgarian and romanian banks have the high fees primarily to fleece their customers and to make a quick profit off their backs . 
  i think it 's the other way around . 
  europe without the eu will sink into irrelevance . 
  it will just be a continent of squabbling small nation states that will be easy pray for rising superpowers like china . 
  yes , but sweden probably had no such clause in its accession treaty . 
  all the recent eu members on the other hand had an explicit clause obliging them to eventually join . 
  they can ony determine ** when ** to join , but not ** if ** they will join . 
  not really . 
  romania and bulgaria have declared readiness to veto it . 
  boris johnson 's career - the new jesus . 
  it is an international treaty obligation that can not be subject to a referendum .
