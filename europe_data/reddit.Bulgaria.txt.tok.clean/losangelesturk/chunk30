   my friend does n't identify as bulgarian or turkish . 
  he is a greek !, 
  and i see him as such too . 
  there is a distinction between ethnicity and citizenship . 
  he may be a greek citizen but that does not make him ethnically greek . 
  it 's hardly unique to you . 
  as an ethnic turk in bulgaria , i 've had to regularly deal with far more insulting posts . 
  although many websites have cleaned up their act now , there was a time when one would regularly come across statements like '' \u0446\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 / \u0442\u0443\u0440\u0446\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043f\u0443\u043d '' , which translates to `` gypsies/turks to soap '' in reference to how during ww2 jews were turned into soap by hitler . 
   because muslims and turks are not native to europe . 
  i beg to differ . 
  muslims and turks have been in europe since at least the 14th century . 
  that is longer than your own country has existed . 
  ps : in fact , [ volga bulgaria ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/volga_bulgaria ) and crimea have been muslim strongholds from even earlier than the 14th century , and those territories are considered a part of europe , which by its geographic definition spans up to the ural mountain . 
  been there , done that . 
  the hdp is already in parliament , and some of them act like spoke-persons for the pkk . 
   pomaks of thrace has n't your state policy always been to deny any links between the pomaks and turkey ? 
  how does turkey failing to meet its obligations to its minority entitle you to do the same , even more so when you are an eu member state ? 
  i mean pomaks are a completely separate issue , according to your official doctrine they are not even turkish . 
  in fact you do not recognize them as bulgarians , either . 
  why would that help ? 
  typically violence is employed when there is no legal avenue for doing politics . 
  but the mostly kurdish hdp is already in parliament even with the 10 % threshold . 
  or imagine having russia as a neighbor . 
  given that you have admitted you are a [ pkk sympathizer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4mxnjz/explosion_rocks_istanbul_district_near_bus_stop/d3zgmy0 ) , an organization that engages in terrorist activities against civilians in order achieve its political goals , i find it hard to sympathize with you . 
  besides you are engaging in false equivalence . 
  that some right-wing turks are posting that hashtag does not mean that the entire turkish nation supports it . 
  on the contrary , from what i have seen most turks go at great lengths to draw a distinction between ordinary kurds , and pkk terrorists . 
  let us not forget that kurds are represented and regular members of the turkish parliament . 
  but the pkk and its supporters must be crushed before they inflict any more damage . 
  i am sorry , but hate speech always rises after terrorist attacks . 
  not only in turkey , but europe too . 
  the responsible thing is to let the legal system deal with it . 
  in this case , twitter should ban this tag as it clearly constitutes hate speech . 
  it is obvious that this is for internal consumption . 
  erdogan is trying to shore up his nationalist credentials in order to attract more mhp voters . 
  it is easy to apologize , when the apology has no consequences . 
  will the us ever apologize for iraq and the hundreds of thousands of people that have died as a result of their decision to invade ? 
  i thought sanctions were going to stay for as long russia continues to occupy crimea . 
  serbia is not even a member of the eu . 
  worst of all , their foreign minister also participated in the spread of that lie . 
  would n't that be counter to freedom of speech ? 
  it is equivalent to the bulgarian ** \u044a ** if you know how to pronounce that . 
  unlikely . 
  turk bashing has turned into a national passtime in some eu parliaments . 
  we are getting used to it . 
   its strange though that iran have so bad relations with azerbaijian considering that between 15-30 million iranians are of primarily azeri descent . 
  that is exactly the reason why . 
  iran fears separatism from its own azeri region , and that is why it is so hostile to the country azerbaijan . 
  erdogan , for all his flaws , is the democratically elected president of turkey and derives his legitimacy from the people that voted for him . 
   `` members of other christian ethnic groups , particularly the aramaic/assyrian and chaldaean christians '' why are you only focusing on the christians ? 
  are the lives of people of other religions that have perished somehow less important ? 
  during the intial russian advance in the east of turkey during ww1 large swathes of muslim circassians , kurds and turks were also killed . 
  yes , let 's completely forget about the million or so azeri refugees . 
  i can not read arabic , but i know there are other similar images . 
  this one for example . 
  [ nsfw ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/lining_up_to_use_a_boy.jpg ), 
  too bad automation will probably render manual labor redundant in the near future . 
  it is turkish written in arabic letters . 
  you could probably write german in arabic letters too . 
  the ottoman empire was among the first to decriminalize homosexuality during the [ tanzimat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanzimat ) reforms in 1876 . 
  it is sad that today turkey is lagging so far behind in lgbt rights . 
  anybody who declares themselves turkish is turkish . 
  that 's the whole point of the famous motto `` ne mutlu t\u00fcrk\u00fcm diyene '' . 
  if somebody chooses to be turkish , then they are turkish by definition . 
  you have no right to tell them they are not . 
  what rights do kurds lack in turkey that let 's say minorities in eu member states in the region like say bulgaria or greece have ? 
  there is obviously a threat posed by the pkk , which is internationally recognized as a terror group , and the turkish security forces have been active against it , but the recent actions against the pkk have been really carefully geared to minimize civilian casualties , and geographically the actions were limited to specific locations where the terror group is active . 
  if you are dealing with a terror group , at some point you have to use force . 
  you can not expect turkey to just hand them roses in the vain hope that they will stop . 
  then how come turkey has been declared safe for all the syrians and other refugees that have been crossing the aegean ? 
  under your assumptions the migrant deal that the eu has made with turkey is illegal since according to you turkey is unsafe . 
  and let us not forget that what you call the kurdish region in turkey also houses a substantial number of refugees . 
  let me give a personal anecdote . 
  i have family that live in western europe , and prior to the parliamentary elections a lot of their turkish friends were erdogan and akp supporters . 
  after the way he dealt with davutoglu , many of them have grown disillusioned with erdogan to the point that they can not stand him anymore . 
  in the next elections , i think many akp supporters will shift to the mhp or not vote at all . 
  if this was a court case , and people were protesting the decision of a judge , i would understand why someone would get touchy about it . 
  but here we are talking about politicians trying to use a historical issue for their own agenda . 
  why does it come as a surprise that people are going to protest ? 
  they have every right to , as you do too . 
  you 'll have the unique once in a life time oportunity to see up close little green men . 
  and since when is it the job of parliaments to decide what constitutes a hisorical fact ? 
  parliaments are inherently political organizations , and people have every right to protest on what politicians do in parliaments . 
  in fact that is the whole point of representative democracy . 
  a lot of diasporas preserve their ethnic ties . 
  for example , you can regularly see armenians organize these kinds of protests in los angeles . 
  in fact , i came across one just recently during the azeri-armenian conflict - a lot of diaspora armenians had gathered in front of the azeri embassy with placards that read things like `` punish the azeris . 
  in terms of population the city of istanbul alone is larger than the whole of serbia . 
  apparently they also wanted to nuke istanbul a few months ago : http://www.fort-russ.com/2015/11/zhirinovsky-proposes-to-drop-nuclear.html, 
   we are not in war . 
  we are in a state of hybrid war . 
  so what kind of technology is it ? 
  it is not the thorium based molten salt reactor , is it ? 
  well , most of my relatives in turkey vote for the chp . 
  they are not fans of the islamists . 
   filled a building full of c4 in stockholm because there was a kurdish pr office there that was `` attacking terrorist operatives '' i was not aware of that incident . 
  i thought you were referring to this incident : http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/10/kurdish-activists-shot-dead-paris if they did indeed put c4 explosives in a bulding , then that is really batshit insane . 
  attacking terrorist operatives is now equivalent to a mini 9/11 ? 
  no civilians were hurt as these pkk operatives were taken down . 
  besides these act took place in paris , not in stockholm .
