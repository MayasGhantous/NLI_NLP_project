  i have heard ridiculous statements about strategic depth and davutoglu before , usually from nationalist bulgarians , but i have yet to see any concrete evidence to support such allegations . 
  as far as it pertains to cyprus , in the book davutoglu mostly focuses on the cyprus problem in the context of it being an obstacle to turkey 's eu candidacy and is seeking to formulate policies that will help the island reunify . 
  in fact , in comparison to previous governments , davutoglu 's government has been more forthcoming with respect to a solution . 
  to accuse him of seeking lebensraum in cyprus is quite ridiculous frankly . 
  the coup only failed because turkey decided to intervene . 
  had that not occurred , cyprus today would have been a province of greece , and the turkish cypriots would have been ... well ... history . 
  yes , i am sure you are the most appropriate person to speak on behalf of turkish cypriots , and what they want . 
  the irony of it all is that it was your side who voted for turkish troops to say . 
  had you accepted the annan peace plan the number of troops would have been reduced to a token of a few hundreds with prospects for the full militarization of the island . 
  my claim is not false . 
  if turkey sought to annex cyprus , it would have done so long ago , but it did not . 
  it is greek intransigence that is pushing turkish cypriots away , and that is precisely what akinci is implying . 
  akinci is probably one of the most liberal turkish-cypriot presidents that you will get as a counterpart . 
  if you ca n't even get along with him , then i wonder if you ever will get along with anybody at all . 
  it is not turks , the cases that i cited were heard before the echr . 
  when you try to illegally join another country against your own founding treaty and exterminate any inconvenient minorities in the process , you tend to face consequences as well . 
  the turkish intervention did not happen in a vacuum , it was a response to a milliary coup lead by eoka thugs such as samson that illegally took over government and tried to turn cyprus into another province of greece over the objections of its turkish population . 
  should there be no political consequences to that ? 
  if turkey intended to annex cyprus , it would have done that a long time ago . 
  that is not what turkey seeks . 
  the turkish objective in cyprus it to safeguard the interests of tcs and to prevent the island from unifying with greece ( enosis ) which seems to be the dream of many greek nationalists like yourself . 
  why do n't you read the pdf that you link . 
  among other things , the copenhagen criteria require :  respect for and protection of minorities the greek cypriot administration is effectively at war with the north , the current status quo is merely a cease fire . 
  how is it possible to guarantee minority rights under such conditions ? 
  turkish cypriots are denied some basic rights such as the right to their properties in the south pending a comprehensive solution and the right to stand in free and fair elections as documented in cases at the echr ( see aziz vs cyprus and sofi vs cyprus ) . 
   the capacity to effectively implement the rules , standards and policies that make up the body of eu law cyprus lacks the capacity to enforce the eu acquis in its territory . 
  that was the state of affairs when the eu decided to admit the south as the sole representative and thereby import that conflict into the union . 
  to this date , tc lack any democratic representation in that government and it can not claim to legitimately represent them and their interests . 
  admitting the south into the union was one giant exception the copenhagen criteria , and that mistake is about to blow up in eu 's face . 
  the eu promised to lift the blockade if tc accepted the annan plan , but it reneged on that promise . 
  the admission of the south as the sole representative of the island into the eu was a massive mistake by the eu - accepting a country which did not have a total control over its territory and was effectively at war with its other half and lacked the capability to enforce the eu acquis over the territory that it claimed was ridiculous . 
  it was in fact in direct violation of the copenhagen criteria . 
  crimea has a substantial tatar population that is facing persecution now under russian rule . 
  russians in crimea make up barely over half of the population . 
  then you have to deal with the consequences . 
  enforcing a crippling economic blockade while expecting the north to be independent of turkey is like wanting to have your cake and eat it too . 
  maintaining the current blockade will only push the north further into turkey 's orbit , and that will not serve the eu objective of integrating tcs into the european union . 
  northern cyprus is different from crimea in that crimea is annexed by russia , whereas the north is at least nominally an independent state that represents the interests of its citizens . 
  if the gcs reject this deal , the embargo will not last . 
  when you are under embargo and economic sanctions , you tend to grow dependent on the only country that provides relief . 
   russian airspace in crimea you mean ukrainian airspace illegally taken over by russia ? 
   its missiles were tested in the barents sea and where is ukraine supposed to carry such tests out ? 
  most of its coastline is occupied by russia . 
  albania did not annex kosovo like russia did in crimea . 
  full text : ** the sultan and the salesman ** ** turkey 's islamist president is embracing donald trump ** * but recep tayyip erdogan 's enthusiasm may not last long * in june , a few months after donald trump , then a candidate for the republican nomination , called for a ban on muslim immigration , turkey 's islamist leader objected . 
  president recep tayyip erdogan demanded that mr trump 's name be removed from trump towers in istanbul . 
  `` the ones who put that brand on their building should remove it immediately , '' he said . 
  mr erdogan appears to have changed his mind , both about the towers and about the man whose name appears on them . 
  although polls show that most turks would have preferred to see hillary clinton as america 's new president , mr trump 's election has been greeted in ankara with a mix of schadenfreude and hope . 
  `` we were suffering from [ american ] policies towards the middle east and turkey under the democrats and obama , '' says yasin aktay , a deputy chairman of the ruling justice and development ( ak ) party . 
  `` this opens a new page . '' the turkish president has been even more emphatic , calling protests against mr trump 's election in america and europe `` a disrespect to democracy '' . 
  flattery may have gotten mr trump somewhere : he reportedly told mr erdogan over the phone that his daughter , ivanka , admired him . 
  in any case , turkey is giving him the benefit of the doubt . 
  for months , its government has pressed america to extradite fethullah gulen , a pennsylvania-based preacher whom turkey accuses of orchestrating a coup attempt in july that claimed some 270 lives . 
  turkish officials now believe mr trump will be more responsive to such exhortations than mrs clinton would have been . 
  ( her campaign accepted donations from followers of mr gulen . ), 
  mr erdogan seems to think that the president-elect , a fellow populist who has expressed admiration for autocrats like vladimir putin , will look the other way as he locks up opponents and panders to his islamist base . 
  he is not slowing down . 
  earlier this month ak tabled a bill pardoning statutory rapists who marry their victims , before shelving it following a popular outcry . 
  had it passed , the law would have allowed as many as 3,000 convicted sex offenders to walk free . 
  that would have freed up room inside turkey 's teeming prisons for some of the 37,000 people , including soldiers , bureaucrats , academics , journalists and a dozen kurdish mps , who have been arrested for political reasons since the july 15th coup . 
  over 120,000 others , including nearly 16,000 last week alone , have been sacked or suspended from office for alleged links to mr gulen or the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) . 
  mr trump is expected to nag foreigners less about human rights than some american presidents have , though no one knows for sure . 
  that would suit turkey just fine . 
  mr erdogan respects western interests , but not western norms . 
  last week he suggested that turkey should join the shanghai cooperation organisation , a eurasian political , economic and military bloc that includes uzbekistan , russia and china , as an alternative to the european union . 
  he may not be bluffing . 
  relations with the eu are worse than at any point since it accepted turkey as a candidate for membership , almost two decades ago . 
  mr erdogan has called for a referendum on ending turkey 's application in 2017 . 
  he has proposed reinstating the death penalty , which would be incompatible with membership . 
  and he has , ridiculously , accused the west as a whole of siding with islamic state ( is ) . 
  his foreign minister recently bragged about refusing to answer phone calls from his german counterpart . 
  the eu 's patience is starting to fray . 
  last week the european parliament voted to recommend suspending turkey 's accession talks . 
  the vote is non-binding , and is unlikely to lead to anything : germany fears that a snubbed turkey might scrap its agreement to block human-smuggling across the aegean sea , allowing hundreds of thousands of migrants once again to flow into greece . 
  but with europe 's populist parties growing stronger , and mr erdogan mobilising public opinion against the west , a showdown will be hard to avert . 
  if turkey hopes to trade worsening relations with europe for a new friendship with mr trump , it will be disappointed . 
  the new president may be sympathetic to turkish concerns about mr gulen , but then again he may not . 
  and in any case , the cleric 's fate rests with america 's courts . 
  meanwhile , mr trump 's team wants to list the muslim brotherhood as a terror group , roll back the nuclear deal with iran , and continue arming the pkk 's syrian wing against is . 
  mr erdogan opposes all these measures vehemently . 
  moreover , the officials named so far to the incoming administration are no great fans of mr erdogan . 
  michael flynn , mr trump 's pick for national security adviser , penned an op-ed this month praising turkey as `` a source of stability '' , but turkish officials were troubled to find that a video shot on the night of the coup shows mr flynn cheering on the mutinous generals against mr erdogan 's government . 
  in a tweet posted on the same date , mr trump 's choice for the head of the cia , mike pompeo , called turkey an `` islamist dictatorship '' . 
  some in ankara are already growing disillusioned . 
  `` this sounds like a crusader discourse , '' says mr aktay . 
  the relationship between mr erdogan and mr trump has gotten off to a good start . 
  it may not last . 
  that tends to happen when you are under interenational embargo , and the only source of funds are from turkey . 
  you can not expect northern cyprus to be both emargoed and independent from turkey . 
  in that context , it is interesting that greece has actually been able to successfully force another country to change its flag . 
  the proper translation would be `` roman administration of southern cyprus '' . 
  in turkey it is customary to refer to greeks outside of greece as roman ( s ) / rum ( lar ) . 
  the greeks in greece are called ionian ( s ) / yunan ( lar ) . 
  it 's called the precautionary principle , you fools . 
  it is called hypernormalisation by adam curtis . 
  it was aired recently , but i can not recall the exact date . 
  the eastern rhodopes is rich in gold deposits . 
  in fact some mining companies are currently aggressively seeking conessions in the area . 
  i feel sad for the damage that they could cause to the enivronment .
