  turkey has more than enough as it is . 
   most want to go home when the war is over . 
  given the current escalation , that does n't look like it going to happen any time soon, 
  isis emerged in the political vacuum that was created by the us invasion of iraq . 
  no us invasion of iraq = no isis . 
  the link is quite clear . 
  can cryptographic protocols ensure anonymity though ? 
  i thought that was one of the remaining open questions . 
  even so the risk of theft is probably lower than 0.5 %, 
  you are excluding albania , but including serbia ? 
  that does not make any sense . 
  what kind of a person has cans\u0131z / lifeless for a surname ? 
  it is quite significant [ compared to previous years ] ( https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2015/11/2300.jpg ) . 
  it is a 10 fold increase compared to a decade ago . 
  compared to previous years , it is quite large . 
  [ washington post : a record number of americans are renouncing their citizenship ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/11/03/a-record-number-of-americans-are-renouncing-their-citizenship-whats-going-on-here/ ), 
  it is not limited to citizens only , fatca actually refers to `` us persons '' and includes residents and certain nonresidents who have links to the us . 
  for example , if you are a foreigner who is married to a us citizen , you may come under the provisions of fatca . 
  there are enough stories of [ `` accidental '' american ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3ws6fn/accidental_american_fatca/ ) that realize that fact only when they want to open a bank account in a foreign country . 
  it is one of the main reasons why a record number of people are [ renouncing their us citizenship ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_account_tax_compliance_act#renunciation_of_citizenship ) . 
  edit : and the bar is not that high . 
  it is [ $ 50k ] ( https://www.irs.gov/businesses/corporations/fatca-information-for-individuals ) which is how much individuals would make in western europe . 
   that 's blatantly not true on the contrary . 
  the united states is the only country in the world ( along with eritrea ) that has [ citizenship based taxation system ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/international_taxation#citizenship ) . 
  all other countries tax based on residence . 
  given how heavyhanded and inequitable american taxation is towards its own ex-pats , this demand is somewhat hypocritical . 
  in 2010 the us passed a law named fatca , and the [ the economist published a pretty good article about it ] ( http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21605907-americas-new-law-tax-compliance-heavy-handed-inequitable-and-hypocritical-fatcas-flaws ) :  america is the only large economy to tax its citizens on everything they earn anywhere in the world . 
  fatca 's purpose is to ensure that not a centime or rouble that a `` us person '' has stashed away goes undetected by the irs . 
  in a piece of extraterritoriality stunning even by washington 's standards , the new law requires banks , funds and other financial institutions around the world to report assets held by american clients or face a ruinous 30 % withholding tax . 
   ( ... )  most of these problems would melt away if america switched to the `` territorial '' system favoured by other advanced countries and taxed only those resident there , not all americans everywhere . 
  america should also embrace the oecd 's efforts , already backed by more than 50 countries , to create a truly multilateral system in which tax information on residents ' accounts and certain investments is shared annually . 
  for that to work , america would need to hand over data similar to those which it demands from others -- something it has hitherto appeared reluctant to do . 
  the financial superpower looks ever more a regulatory bully , setting rules it ignores itself . 
  could it be that the usa is opposed to the eu probe , because it would prefer to keep those tax revenues for itself ? 
  slovenia and croatia [ also have one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93slovenia_border_disputes ) . 
  the winter war with finland lasted for quite some time . 
  i guess finns should be grateful that the russians did n't have nukes back then . 
  the [ northeastern shore of the black sea ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/resettlement_of_circassians_into_ottoman_empire.jpg ) was inhabited by a people called circassians ( adige in their own language ) . 
  when the russian empire expanded into their territory , they wiped them out and almost erased them from the collective memory . 
  the russian historian berzhe bore witness to the state of the circassians as they awaited deportation on the black sea shore :  i shall never forget the overwhelming impression made on me by the mountaineers in nvorissiisk bay , where about seventeen thousand of them were gathered on the shore . 
  the late , inclement and cold time of the year , the almost complete absence of means of subsistence and the epidemic of typhus and smallpox , raging among them made their situation desperate . 
  and indeed , whose heart would not be touched on seeing , for example , the already stiff corpse of a young circassian woman lying in rags on the damp ground under the open sky with two infants , one struggling in his death throes while the other sought the assuage his hunger at his dead mother 's breast ? 
  and i saw not a few such scenes . 
  george ditson , the first american to visit circassia , in a book dedicated to prince vorontsov cites the russian ruler of the caucasus as saying :  these circassians are just like your american indians - as untamable and uncivilized ... and owing to their natural energy of character , extermination only would keep them quiet . 
  a good resource on the subject is a [ book by walter richmond ] ( http://rutgerspress.rutgers.edu/product/circassian-genocide,362.aspx ) . 
  denmark and canada also have [ a territorial dispute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hans_island ) . 
  the policy of appeasement did not work against hitler prior to ww2 , and it will not work against putin now . 
  if russia is allowed to get away with using a nuclear device in turkey in order `` to quickly end the war '' , then that would set a terrible precedent . 
  if there was a confrontation with poland , or with finland , what would prevent russia from employing the same strategy there ? 
  is syria really such a vital interest to russia that it would risk apocalypse over it ? 
  for what ? 
  so that assad can continue to be a dictator in his country ? 
  it is really sad that so few people in the west know about the circassian genocide . 
  if more people were aware of it , there would be more pressure on russia in cases like this . 
  if erdogan and putin succeed in destroying each other , that would be a net positive for the world and their respective countries . 
  the orange is erdogan 's party , and the red are the secularists . 
   us can not afford to have 2 nato members fighting each other what makes you think that greece and turkey are going to fight each other ? 
  if anything there are more prospects for cooperation than conflict . 
  especially with the renewed prospect for unification in cyprus . 
  they ca n't cut production because they need every last cent of foreign hard currency to prop up their dwindling reserves . 
  she is from [ kardzhali ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kardzhali ) . 
  the situation is pretty bad and people are exploited , but they put up with it because of the few employment opportunities in the region . 
  i think the issue is more of greece wanting to use the migrant flow as a political tool and leverage for its dealings with the rest of europe , perhaps even to punish germany for its stance during the eurocrisis . 
  given that there exists a landborder between turkey and the eu in thrace , one has to wonder why do the migrants cross throught the aegean . 
  given that the main reason macedonia is still not in nato , is because of naming conflict with greece , i wonder if this crisis will give a new impetus to macedonia 's membership in nato . 
   sanction the shit out of turkey that would be like cutting your nose off in order to spite your face . 
  why does everybody here assume that turkey is allowing these refugees through out of malice , rather of a genuine inability to deal with the problem of millions of these people flooding the country from across the border with syria ? 
  sanctioning the country would be like beating a dead horse . 
  turkey is already crumbling under the weight of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the influx of refugees . 
  if europe is serious about reducing the flow of these people it needs to help turkey , not sanction it . 
   can walk without drowning i guess you 've never heard of the [ darien gap ] ( http://www.darkroastedblend.com/2008/09/darien-gap-most-dangerous-absence-of.html ) . 
  if russia initiates hostilities in ukraine , while still engaged in syria , i think it will have bitten more than it can chew . 
  with the low oil prices their currency reserves will not last them for long . 
  is this irrational erratic behavior perhaps a sign that they are beginning to panic ? 
  what incentives does russia have to cooperate and take these people back ? 
  and what do they do with them ? 
  source ? 
  do n't you think they need to finish their `` job '' in syria , before being able to focus back on ukraine ? 
  my aunt works in one of those factories . 
  the invasion of cyprus was not illegal . 
  turkey was bound by the [ treaty of guarantee ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_guarantee_%281960%29 ) , which according to wikipedia :  article iv reserves the right of the guarantor powers to take action to re-establish the current state of affairs in cyprus , a provision which was used as justification for the turkish invasion of 1974 . 
  the treaty also allowed the uk to retain sovereignty over two military bases . 
  it was the military coup that attempted to annex the country to greece that triggered the invasion . 
  if you can blame turkey for anything it is that rather than restoring constitutional order , it chose to occupy half of the island . 
  but hey , the south had to pay a political price for trying to annex the island to greece and ethnically cleanse the turkish cypriots . 
  even in the balkans there are a lot of people that like turkey and want to be friends . 
  in the balkans there are a lot of russia lovers . 
  they are really loud in their anti-turkish rhetoric , but make no mistake they do not represent the majority . 
   where do you think isis sells all there oil ? 
  the biggest buyer of isis oil is the syrian regime . 
  this russian meme never gets old . 
  turkey supports isis only in the minds of the putinbots and the imbeciles who have bought into their propaganda . 
   finally , i hope future proves i 'm full of shit here . 
  that we slow down the mass migration , that countries stabalize on their own , start to prosper . 
  this . 
  turkey and the eu need to stabilize the situation in syria urgently to allow these people to stay in their country , and the rest to go back there . 
  to me it seems that russia is deliberately creating the most recent refugee flows through its bombardment of aleppo in order to punish the eu for the sanctions , and turkey for shooting down its jet . 
  it is their russian buddies that are causing this entire mess in the first place . 
  if it was not for them carpet bombing aleppo to help their friend assad , none of the most recent immigrants would feel the need to flee and press against the turkish border in their tens of thousands . 
  europe is not weak willed , it is just schizophrenic .
