not unless you come from a third world country and even they leave as soon as possible . 
  if you do n't have euroes , franks work for me - my bridge stretches from the us west coast all the way to spain !, 
  it a different situation in bulgaria though , as the country is becoming extremely segregated . 
  currently the ethnic bulgarians are moving into the larger cities ( sofia , plovdiv , varna , burgas ) , the gypsies tend to move into the small cities / large villages and the muslim population is either living in the southeastern part of the country or in historically pomak areas . 
  there are very few places that have a volatile mix of muslim/christians or gypsy/bulgarians . 
   forcing such change not to be cheeky ( i say as i am about to ) , but it 's not forced ... there was a referendum . 
  56 % of the population participated . 
  we have 90 parties , some of them with similar platforms that try to take votes from the disenfranchised voters of the other party . 
  the fracturing of parliament is a big thing . 
   i would n't even consider it as legitimate as the winning party will get power it did n't receive from the voters . 
  i think there is a struggle between representation and effectiveness when it comes to democracy . 
  you make it too effective and you 're looking at a one-party system that does not represent the people , you increase representation to a drastic degree and you ca n't have an effective government . 
  we were n't offered with the perfect solution , but it is something . 
  is this going to result in 2-3 party system in the future ? 
  probably , but we 're trying to deal with the immediate problem of a government , too fractured to work here . 
  as weird as it might sound , it 's probably for the best . 
  we 're kind of the anti-usa in this matter . 
  the u.s. has two parties that need to fracture in order to better represent the ideology of its people , while we have too many parties to form a cohesive government . 
  it 's at least something that could lead to an effective rule , instead of too many parties , all of which holding too few seats , all being too greedy to form a stable coalition . 
   although with mandatory fptp voting , which we also voted on in a retarded referendum today , they still win the fptp won with a supermajority ( 74.2 % yes ) , so it 's most likely going to happen - even if the referendum is not considered valid . 
  the vote was `` yes '' on the first past the post . 
  it won with a supermajority of 74.2 % `` yes '' . 
  christianity about eighteen hundred years before that ? 
  the whole fetishism towards the military-ordinate and non-material spartan lifestyle ? 
  `` apply '' means that you can `` apply '' his ideas . 
  you can not apply his ideas . 
  well , you can , but i mean , at what level of `` this is not true communism '' are we at ? 
  none of those things were original to marx , they were as old as dirt back in the day . 
   marx was a brilliant academic no . 
  `` brilliant academic '' means that you generate valuable ideas . 
  his ideas have a certain appeal on a basic level , but have been - and always will be - a colossal failure . 
  he 's an overrated fuck up . 
  bulgaria - the poorest nation in the e.u. 
  - has tripled it 's gdp since it left the soviet union . 
  sometimes i wonder what it could have been , had the soviets never came . 
  heh ... that rubik 's cube was quite the fight . 
  i think this has more to do with borisov acting like a whiny little bitch , than any of bsp 's efforts . 
  my post is in the hypothetical . 
  the situation is not comparable , ergo why i said `` does not ** feel ** '' . 
  however there is a rise in anti-eu sentiment caused by various elements ( combination of overregulation , immigration and overreach ) , brexit did not happen `` just because '' , nor did pvv win more seats than the previous elections `` just because '' . 
  lepen is a major factor that i do not want to see happen . 
  so there are enough people that ** feel ** negatively about the e.u. 
  their concerns must be addressed or we will see the pvv ( i hope i 'm not messing the party 's abbreviation ) win ever more seats next time around and even if lepen does not win ** now ** , should the issues of those that voted for her not be addressed , she 'd win next time . 
  for the sake of the european union , we should not draw hard lines and marginalize critics , at a times when we should have open discussion . 
  i 'm throwing my vote for `` new republic '' , do n't know if they 'll get in , but i do n't see it as a win-lose game . 
  i trust them the most ( or as much as i can anyway ) and i see a good representation for myself in them . 
  god speed !, 
  i 'm throwing my vote for them anyway . 
  this is not a game of winners and losers . 
  if they win - they win , if not i do n't see why i should vote for parties that do not represent me . 
  my point is that if the european union is to prevent it 's member states from being `` dominated '' by another power , than the e.u. 
  itself becoming an oppressive force is going to be counter productive . 
  and no , i 'm not going to give any nation or `` association '' which seeks to be a master moral authority . 
  would it matter if you 're a slave to beijing or brussels ? 
  because if person a does not feel like a freeman in his/her own country , than whatever the masters is waving an indian , american or `` eu '' flag is irrelevant . 
  triggered . 
  yes ... 25 % of the world gdp is in the united states . 
  twenty five . 
  to not understand how gargantuan this is you must have flunked either maths or economics . 
  maybe both . 
  [ also - news flash - europe exports more to the u.s. , than it imports . 
  ] ( https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0003.html ) if trade stops , the u.s. is going to suffer much less , than we will . 
  also , what 's with your fetishism of power projection ? 
  edit : hitting the downvote button does n't make you right . 
   we need to demand that the us enter into a bipartisan power-sharing agreement so ... you want to increase the military budget of the e.u. 
  to 3-4 % per nation ? 
   put sanctions do you have an iota of idea how massive the u.s. economy is ? 
   airstrikes yes , do an airstrike on the u.s.a. , i dare you . 
  you 've got it down pretty well , i 'd say the problem with your gf is that she probably does n't want to be convinced . 
  the big reason many bulgarians do not support a conversion to the euro is due to unequal exchange . 
  our economy is too small to take such a massive volatility , we are not going to exchange at the current 2 lev to 1 euro rate , but something much less favorable , not to mention a very likely price hike as people are trying to compensate for said volatility . 
  i 'm fine with second-speed europe , rushing into schengen or the eea is going to do more harm , than good . 
  this is important to remember , countries where inequality is lower are countries in which everyone is poor - no exception to this rule has ever existed . 
  if we assume that people are to be rewarded based on their merit - and you practice this long enough - discrepancies will emerge . 
  sure , there might be a banker a the city of london that makes more in a month , that you do in an year , but it 's very likely that you make more in an year , than some people do in a lifetime . 
  hope to see my country dark purple one day , might some rich fuck laughs at us poor fucks , as foreigners scramble to reach our land of inequality . 
  yes , god forbid we do n't do what the human rights violating dictator say . 
  what a shame it would be if we did something about glorious leader obtaining nuclear weapons . 
  i 've been warning people that the e.u. 
  will turn into the polish lebensraum , but did they believe me ? 
  noooooooooooo ... 
  is this photoshopped ? 
  the grass looks waaay too green . 
  from your mouth , to god 's ears . 
  too many old people , too few taxpayers . 
  also , everyone is getting concentrated in three cities ( sofia , plovdiv , varna ) so the total area of the country matters little . 
  it 's bad , but not that bad . 
  if you open your business and it does well , you 're not going to get some mafiozos trying to extort money or some sneaky government-backed monopoly closing you down . 
  if you work hard and do well for yourself , you 're not going to notice it . 
  if you 're using government services , it 's going to have lowered the quality of them . 
  and i am sure being told by teacher and advisers constantly that you must emigrate abroad does not help . 
   you are acting like the us government creates that military equipment and its technology they have a say in what technology is being sold and what information on technology is being shared . 
  if you think lockheed or northrop grumann is going to share u.s. military secrets you 're not being realistic . 
   germany already produces tanks on par with the us . 
  with all due respect , the leopard has only been deployed in afghanistan , the abrams has seen a decade of combat . 
   and europe already produces some of best rifles in the world many better than what the current us military uses . 
  based on an u.s. design ( the colt ) if i might add . 
  but this is true , h&k are some of the best rifles . 
   that 's why it 's a question of will in the eu and not capability . 
  only if you assume that u.s. companies would smuggle military secrets , behind the government 's back .
