  the french , german and americans have front roll , you can see junker on the second roll and the further from the center this goes the less relevant the figures . 
  feels like watching a trainwreck in slow motion , does n't it ? 
  it will be once russia joins the e.u. 
  montgomery was the best general of world war ii , suck it rommel . 
  edit : question for visiting americans - who was greater john `` black jack '' pershing or george marshall ? 
  would you be against the building of fountains , statues and arches ? 
  because i 'm willing to pay a bit more in taxes for it . 
  the longer i live the more i sympathize with the saying `` man does not live on bread alone . '', 
  that 's actually fair . 
   eu military ah yes , with the participation of a nation that has n't won a war for over a century , a nation that has n't surrendered in a major war for over two centuries ( napoleon surrendered and in ww1 french soldiers refused to obey orders to advance ( wtf ? 
  at least have as much integrity as the russians and do a full-bodied coup ) ) , the italians who were a liability to any ally they 've ever had , the spanish who 's principle opponent has been themselves ( hi catalonia ! ), 
  and everything east of germany that is rightfully ignored . 
  even without the language barrier this is going to be a clusterfuck . 
  god bless america . 
  unlike trump , bill clinton was actually impeached . 
  edit : and might i inquire about the reason for the downvotes ? 
  your displeasure does not change history . 
  say what you will about the nazi 's , but they were very good at imagery . 
  i unironically wish our governments were just as good . 
   trainee doctors from ireland and the uk are heading for central and eastern europe to study , lured by ** high standards ** and lower costs . 
  hahahahaha ... no . 
  they 're here because the u.k. recognizes the diplomas , there are no high standards here . 
  yes , but that does n't negate the fact that the 2nd amendment would do its job if needs be . 
  there 's no conceivable way for the u.s. government to win against it 's own population , if there is a massive insurgence . 
   bulgaria banning fracking must be easy when there 's nothing to frack . 
  one for his wife and one for merkel ? 
   i do n't think that would do us any favor , to be honest . 
  it wo n't win us any friends , it would absolutely destroy they e.u. 
  ability to wage foreign policy . 
  more importantly though are we going to play by the same rules or not ? 
  the rules are simple - do this and you get into these areas of cooperation . 
  i 'm not stupid - some animals are more equal than others - but this is going a bit far . 
  how much should we wait , when we have already fulfilled the obligations set forth by the e.u. ? 
   but yeah , we could say , `` we do n't cause trouble to you so you should give us what you owe us or the people in our countries will grow to be euroskeptic . 
  time to decide : in or out . '', 
  that 's bluffing and frankly if they plan to stuck us in limbo when it comes to the e.u. / shenghen - do they really care if we 're euroskeptic or not ? 
  we have been given the tools to flip the table , if we are cheated or abused ( not claiming abuse here , just giving an example ) . 
  i think we 're approaching the point where we should either flip the table or become that kid that always gets cheated out . 
  i 'm not an euroskeptic , i support further political and economical integration , but this must be done ( and should only be done ) with fair rules and fair play . 
  i have somewhat of an obsession of stock footage like that . 
  it 's fascinating , having these great and powerful men speak and wave and look at you from the past . 
  it 's more than the memory of them , but their voice and their features . 
  it 's fascinating . 
  is this considered interfering in their electoral process ? 
  yup , i 'm not seeing this spreading around the region , but it should . 
  i do n't think they 're big fans after that cruise missile strike in syria and then wanting to add additional sanctions ( ca n't remember if congress approved or not ) . 
  frankly , i 'm against the idea of a ubi , but if germany wants to give it a go - sure , go ahead . 
   the flag of dusty untermensch sofia over glorious varna the seventh circle of hell was made for people like you . 
  being impeached does not remove the president from office . 
  bill clinton was impeached during his term , he laughed it off and finished the rest of his eight years . 
  even if they eventually manage to do it to trump ( which is very doubtful ) , do n't expect anything to come off it . 
  trump being impeached would do nothing . 
  brexit is n't forever either , britain is the second largest contributing member . 
  even if the english were not a fan of the e.u. 
  and fought against its enlargement , the money they provided gave the european institutions leverage . 
  if at any point the brits decide to reverse gear , everyone in high position would jump on their side . 
  field-tested technology . 
  the abrams has been on battlefields since forever . 
  the only time the leopard 2 has been deployed was in the war in afghanistan ( i think ) . 
  so i 'm sure that the leopard is beautiful on paper , but i just trust technology that 's been in combat conditions for longer ( and has continuously been updated ) . 
  this is n't about the british who are abroad , but the foreigners who are in britain . 
  `` eu citizenship '' , would do them any good , the need some kind of a way to identify themselves in britain as non-citizens . 
  sounds about right , it 's not like they could have just left them there with nothing or gave them uk citizenship . 
  there is no '' / s '' here , if a join e.u. 
  army is built ( which i am for ) , you 're going to suddenly see a lot of nails for that brand new hammer . 
   scrap the one tech that has a good proven track record ? 
  i 'd take an abrams over a leopard any day of the week . 
  the increase in demand would require an increase in supply , which means you 'll get to see new factories open up - some of them will do so in eastern european / central states . 
  just because the weapons are designed by germans ( and germans alone - sorry france ) , does n't mean that they 'll be produced in germany alone . 
  yup , with the second-largest contributing member and only one of the three relevant ones , it means less gibs for eastern europe . 
  this will create a lot of turmoil in the e.u. , because most of the east - from my experience - see the e.u. 
  as a political tool , rather than an ideal . 
  i 'm not talking about any `` exits '' , but without gibs you 'll see poland , hungary and the rest be more willing to pull their foot down when they feel the need to . 
  the `` european coal and steel community '' does not an european union make . 
  if france and germany went at each other at that time , the rest of europe would n't have even cared , it would have in no way threaten peace on the continent , the way ww i and ww ii did . 
   peace on the european continent the e.u. 
  in it 's current form was created in the early 90 's . 
  before that the two previous world giants turned-irrelevant powers created a - was it a coal treaty ? 
  something like that . 
  given the position france and germany were in , if they had started fighting again , no one would have cared . 
  not even the british . 
   freedom to live and work across the e.u. 
  +1 , but i have reservations on whatever or not that had any positive effect for us in bulgaria . 
   the european single market still kind-of ambivilant about that . 
  made trade easier , but i can not help but feel that this is a franco-german trade protectionism scheme . 
  the czechs and poles were a big beneficiaries though ( from what i know , could be wrong ) . 
   protection of workers rights that was done long before the e.u. 
  was a thing and has been expanding for the last 200 years . 
   a european identity no one has ever been able to tell me what this is . 
   removing borders between states +1 and an additional +1 for the roaming ruling . 
   influence of europe in the world so far nothing has been done , but what i expect of the e.u. 
  to make sure europe is not irrelevant in a world of u.s.a. , china and india ( russia being touted as a superpower is a sad joke ) , not to make the e.u. 
  a global power . 
   support for deprived regions +1 , though i 'd love to seem them get a tougher stance and refuse handouts when they detect corruption . 
   higher standards for consumers hahahaha ... recently we got a study that shows same-brand products in the west are of higher quolity , than the east . 
   democratic values we 've had a democracy before the e.u. , we 'll have it after the e.u. 
   protection of the enviroment dunno on that one . 
   the euro currency +1 , but i 'm wary about accepting it . 
   in some camp ** wooden ** camp , with no electricity or internet . 
  where communication takes weeks / months .
