  you also have to actively forage . 
  yes , i 'm that spoiled . 
  if paradox could please hurry up and make a good classical antiquity / bronze age game , i 'd be grateful . 
  but we already have a [ navy jack . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/naval_jack_of_bulgaria.svg ), 
  if the color is white , i think the logo should default to the next color . 
  the stars just do n't look good on white . 
   it 's better to have a tech you can trust , especially in the army . 
  well . 
  i mean , i 'd take an abrams over a leopard every day of the week . 
  also , e.u. 
  countries are forking money for the f-35 . 
  it also cements our relationship with the u.s. as bff 's . 
  the u.s. congress will eat its hat , before letting anyone destroy their biggest military-industrial buyer . 
  because nato . 
  he 's right to fear us . 
  i thought serbia was the go-to nation to wreck for no apparent reason in europe . 
  why not just go u.s. tech ? 
  it 's superior anyway . 
  you sure you want to go in that discussion with that flag ? 
  yeah ... you do n't even have to pay us . 
  yeah , we now modern european values , no more stabby-stab , you have my * bulgarian * word for it !, 
   back stab everything we 've done to you , you 've had it coming . 
  ... huh . 
  different work environment then . 
  actually no , scratch that , i 'm just probably confusing our institutions of higher learning with yours . 
  ... you do not work in i.t. , do you ? 
   build a uniform european market so start-ups do n't have to abide to 27 different regulations yeah , french regulations are absurd . 
  he can keep 'em . 
  ... you do realize the the e.u. 
  is in fact the polish libensraum . 
  they 're not taking `` their stuff back '' - they 're taking everything !, 
  we had two massive empires , becoming major players in eastern european - central european politics . 
  now we 're surrounded by romania , greece and turkey , three nations each greater than our own , isolated into a small corner onto the balkans . 
  we have american bases on our soil and the russians dominate our sea . 
  in a way i find that calming , we 've been big , now we 're small and we shall be big again . 
  just give us about 600 years or so . 
  you 're saying it as if they need a reason . 
   interfering in us elections probably was n't done with a single goal in mind in fact , it was probably not done at all . 
  so does czechia and poland . 
  this is n't going to `` drag down '' the e.u. 
  economy , it is going to obliterate it with decades to recover . 
  you might actually see germany deposed from the position of powerplayer by italy or france in that case . 
  it 'd be ugly . 
  i dread the day when the german auto-industry goes bust . 
   we still have a much higher unemployment than romania that 's misleading . 
  there 's a difference between not having enough people to fill a factory , to plow a field or erect a building and high-end programmers and financial advisers . 
  most of the second category - despite getting wonderful salaries - move westwards for a level of pay they could never get in bulgaria . 
  considering our demographic collapse , i very much doubt it . 
  also - we need to sabotage anyone doing better than us . 
  that goes for every developing nation though . 
   romania  greece  no bulgaria god damn it , not again !, 
   skoda pity , it 's an awesome brand . 
   its certainly going to be interesting to see if all eu members that ignore the eu refugee policy will be sanctioned or otherwise punished . 
  hopefully not , i 'm ok with admitting some for humanitarian purposes , but if others do n't want to , it 's their right to choose . 
  `` freedom from slavery '' - immediately closed it after that one . 
  the uk abolished slavery centuries before the e.u. 
  was even a thing . 
  i enjoy comedy , i do not enjoy comedy based on misleading the viewer . 
  some changes in the headline ... 
  original title : `` eu warns 3 countries of legal action over refugee plan '' substituted with the opening paragraph for the sake of clarity : `` the european union warned the czech republic , hungary and poland on tuesday that they have 24 hours to start taking in refugees under an eu migrant sharing plan or face legal action . '', 
  abriavated - `` european union '' to `` e.u. 
  '' , `` the czech republic '' to `` czechia '' and `` an eu migrant sharing plan '' to `` a migrant sharing plan '', 
  changed the title a bit . 
  original : `` eu warns poland that it has 24 hours to start taking in refugees '' the first line of the article is ... `` the eu has issued a 24-hour warning to ** czech republic , hungary and poland ** saying that they have to start taking in refugees under an eu migrant-sharing plan . '', 
  so for the sake of better information ( most people will not read the article ) i added the czech republic and hungary in the title as well . 
  should n't there be anyone keeping integration in check ? 
   democracy is an illusion . 
  even kids here know that . 
  no , exit polls match estimates relatively closely . 
  there is some trikery going on , but we have honest elections . 
   and good luck trying to break it in as a new guy in the political scene , they will crush you if people even notice you . 
  the tzar did n't have a problem . 
  in the ppp table i put in a comment above you could actually see the numbers aligning ... bulgaria for 2010 was at 15,669 and for 2016 that was at 20,326 greece . . for 2010 was at 28,961 and for 2016 that was at 26,669 so we are getting close to parity , 5 years is a good estimate . 
   honestly , the eu is not even trying to help us fight the corruption even a little bit . 
  i think that 's up to us , not them . 
  it is a complicated issue - yes . 
  ... you did n't pass math class , did you ? 
  or has our educational system failed that hard ? 
  it 's better than being in ukraine , moldova , belarus or some other places , as clearly indicated by the numbers . 
  it 's also much worse than any developed nation you might think of . 
  i mean - they 're not the poorest nation in europe you know ? 
  i 've been thinking about making some kind of a contributing comment , but i 'm laughing so hard right now . 
  i 'm just going to leave this and laugh at whatever news rag this is . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita, 
  everyone knows it 's there to plug a budget hole , it has nothing to do with the environment . 
  never change sweden , never change . 
  saving this article for the next time some idiot is screaming about a tax union . 
  so if i see a picture of merkel with a hitler mustache and a message that the e.u. 
  is the forth reich , are depictions of the e.u. 
  flag and merkel considered hate symbols ? 
  why ** should ** there be consequences ? 
  they do n't want to accept refugees from africa or the middle east , it 's no unreasonable . 
  about time france joined the neo-liberal world !, 
  not to be rude , but i do n't trust any chart that has le pen economically on the right . 
  huh , so we 'll see what he does basically . 
  best of luck !, 
  i know he supports us joining the eurozone ... which is something i do n't know how to feel about . 
  other than that i do n't know his policies , other than not being le pen . 
  privatization or more social programs ?
