  edit : look , the man is going around screaming about how `` tough '' he is . 
  it did n't look good when trump did it , it does n't look good when macron does it . 
  and the british empire ... and the french one . 
  frankly this new global liberalism is a fairly new phenomenon that could turn horribly wrong . 
  this is n't to lambaste it , but more to point out that what the russians are doing has generally worked . 
  yes , one has to wonder why they have n't started killing themselves en mass . 
   the eu just need to invest more money on this backbone and we can be really relevant on the global stage with the rise of china and india the e.u. 
  could at best stay relevant and not be crushed by the rising powers . 
  that could contest the united states of america on the world stage is n't happening . 
  i just thought her speech was a justification of the inevitable rise to 2 % military spending as per nato 's request . 
  i would n't mind our military buying a few of those ... ... heard you guys also made good subs ? 
   this fact means that the global power balance has shifted away from the alliance of the west , which is a non-entity at this point . 
  the alliance between the united states of america and the e.u. 
  is stronger than the alliance between china and any of its allies , or russia and any of its allies . 
  in fact nato is as strong as it ever was , with [ nato support growing among all it 's members . 
  ] ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2017/05/23/natos-image-improves-on-both-sides-of-atlantic/ )  even if trump had said everything we wanted to hear , it is still trump - a fuckwit that can be relied upon to consider politics a form of business administration . 
  you do know trump is a very intelligent person right ? 
  media lambasts him all the time , but if he were as stupid , he would n't have beaten clinton , rolled past the republican candidates , had his 90 's comeback , succeeded as a tv personality or turned millions into billions . 
  you do n't get to where trump is by being stupid and the testimony to this is the many billionaires who 've lost it all and political candidates who 've never held his post . 
  calling the man `` fuckwit '' is fun , but it hardly makes your post appear serious . 
   merkel is right . 
  it is time to take matters back into our own hands , because the 70odd years of relying on outside forces for our security are over . 
  the e.u. 
  already has a [ defense clause ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_security_and_defence_policy ) . 
  doing more at this point means increasing the budget at this point . 
  which is probably why merkel was saying what she did - they need a justification . 
  if you think us / europe are going to have some kind of a cooling of relationship , you 're falling of political speech . 
   and in the face of a new russian nationalism , which has always been proselytizing and expansionist in its history , there is only one option to secure a future for our continent : rearmament and continuous integration . 
  i 'm willing to bet 5 euro that you 're not familiar with russian history or contemporary russian politics . 
   date is still wrong !, 
  date is right . 
  we call this - the trump effect !, 
  i think i made it clear that it 's an issue of refugees , not turkish aggression ? 
  my problem is that erdogan is blackmailing the e.u. 
  and `` i 'll release the refugees in europe '' is going to go through either greece or bulgaria . 
  if it comes to that we would need a major operation in order to either direct the flow or block the path . 
  but even without that we are having a problem of people just sneaking past the border . 
  it 's not about turkey deciding to restore the ottoman empire . 
  delete this !, 
  frankly i agree with the americans - this is embarrassing . 
   but what do you need the military for ? 
  in bulgaria 's case ? 
  we 're deployed at u.n. peace keeping missions and we need a stronger patrol on the border ( not the favorite state for refugees , but turkey is next door ) . 
  furthermore we do need a certain level of an army ready to go in case the americans or the french ( both of which are our allies ) want us to deploy somewhere . 
  heck , at 2 % we would n't even be hiring new personal , just improving infrastructure , resupplying munitions and updating the hardware ( the navy is in dire need of some new ships / submarines ) . 
  and yes , i am actually willing to pay a higher tax if need be . 
  i believe the military is like health insurance - you hope you never have to use it , but you have it just in case . 
  sometimes i wonder how the u.s. is capable of attracting such capable foreigners ( also included in this is kissinger ) , put them in such high positions and have them be so loyal to the united states of america . 
  may he rest in peace , god knows he 's done his good work on this good earth . 
  he lives in switzerland , do n't rub it in . 
  note : i just realize your pepsi is sold half-a-price to ours . 
  i 'd kill for some quality peanut butter . 
  also , best steaks money could buy . 
  [ but would you call that a proper investigation ? 
  ] ( http://edition.cnn.com/2017/05/26/politics/james-comey-fbi-investigation-fake-russian-intelligence/index.html ), 
   if there are no connections then what have they been investigating for over a year ? 
  was there ever a proper investigation ? 
  they 've been calling for one , but i 'm not aware of anyone actually doing it . 
  1 ) first of all just because you are allowed to testify does n't mean you actually have any testimonies to make . 
  2 ) it 's a ploy to excuse him from other illegal dealings . 
  from what i gathered the e.u. 
  wants a hard brexit as well , so i do n't know how salvageable the single market thing is , tbqh . 
  same shit over here as well . 
  it 's why i 've adopted the extreme stance that only taxpayers should be allowed to vote . 
  is there any place that it does n't ? 
  putin should have just been called a shit-stirrer and ignored . 
  throwing a tantrum is doing nothing . 
  but then again , if they were at least semi-competent they would n't be our politicians . 
  bush tried that as well , but georgia happened . 
  i think trump was aiming for better relationship with russia as well , but with the syrian conflict on-going it 's a problem . 
   considering how russia talks constantly about how they are encircled by the world [ yeah , i mean , wtf is their nation doing there ? 
  ] ( http://goudportal.nl/gp2_def/images/content/nato-bases-around-russia.jpg ), 
  i honest to god want to see a referendum about it . 
  it 'd probably be ignored ( as always ) , but i want to see it . 
  i 'm just somewhat bittered about not having a referendum on joining the e.u. 
  the government just signed on it and that was it . 
  now first of all - complete disclosure - i would have voted to join the e.u. , as would have the majority of bulgarians at the time ( and still ) . 
  joining the euro though ... it depends on the exchange rate . 
  i do classify them as greeks ( get ready to wage a war on that with some people though ) , but that does n't change the fact that this is a bulgarian achievement . 
  sure , they might have been born greek , but if they never `` emigrated '' to the bulgarian kingdom the glagolic alphabet would have had a stillbirth . 
  it 's like werner von braun . 
  german scientist running a program that is a continuation of a german program that made it so america is the first nation ( and so far only ) of on moon . 
  and this is quite the adequate comparison , since as von braun had many us scientists helping him , so did the two brothers had a lot of bulgarian scholars finalizing the product into what later became the cyrillic alphabet . 
  yes , they 're located in front of the national library . 
  jeez , we need to up our fish consumption numbers . 
  on second thought - tell it to farage . 
   bulgaria - cons : corruption / pros : small debt it 'd probably be a very unpopular move to do here . 
  most people believe adopting the euro would have a negative impact . 
  that being said , i would n't worry about corruption in this case . 
  we do n't mess around with our currency , nor do we cook books . 
  and it 'd sound just as elitist . 
  from the article you 've linked ...  an american defense official in military planning ** allegedly told ** the news and  trump ** may ** have `` compromised a vital source of information on the islamic state and possibly iran . '', 
  the first two lines of the article make every effort not to be hold accountable for what they report . 
  [ and that 's the tweet that follow from the one you 've linked . 
  ] ( https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/864438529472049152 ), 
  do these scandals need reporting though ? 
  has anything ever came out of them ? 
  because this thing 's been going since trump won the nomination . 
  the media covered for obama and bush when it comes to horrible things . 
  you 'd think they 'll try to rip trump if he ever did anything actually horrible , but will they ?
