  or will they bury it in clickbait articles that everyone will forget in two weeks ? 
  does trump ? 
  because that 's yet to be confirmed and they 've been going at this before he was elected . 
  be careful not to end up looking like a birther . 
  at this point - when it comes to trump - i equate `` anonymous sources '' with `` making stuff for clickbait '' . 
  that 's how you get a world war . 
  there 's never been a multipolar world that did n't end with a record body count . 
  and i prefer it 's the united states , rather than russia or china . 
  god bless america !, 
  is putin consider an european leader ? 
  no open boarders and no freedom of movement . 
  low birthrates and massive immigration . 
  ... can anyone explain to me what is happening in bulgaria ? 
  they could pull the american trick for young people - go to the army , serve two years , get free university education . 
   ee did n't show any gratitude for what she did , tho . 
  if by ee you mean eastern europe i do n't understand what they should show gratitude for in this case ? 
   because its simply not true . 
  these far-right demagogues need to be called out for their lies . 
  and how is this type of conduct helpful , it just looks like the reporter went in with his own biases and rolled with them ? 
  anyone on the right is going to look at this reporter the way sane people look at alex jones . 
   its the medias job to be the watchdog of our society . 
  a ) no , they 're supposed to report the truth . 
  and b ) there 's a difference between pointing out the difference between the facts / falsehoods behind a statement and being cheeky . 
  specifically in this case , the reporter does not give the reader the context in which the interviewee is wrong . 
   zeit online : since when do you actually believe this untruth yourself ? 
  all i 'm getting from this is that the zeit is a rag , i can not see a creditable news source formulate a question like that . 
  edit : the downvote button does n't make zeit 's conduct any more professional . 
  to everything else on the list ... napoleon did not die in battle , he surrendered . 
  also i believe that cardinal richelieu created the model of foreign policy we follow today . 
  our constitutions prohibits it . 
  if you expect me to start proudly wave the bulgarian flag and talk about how superior we are , you 'll be waiting for awhile . 
  my point is that if the two major leaders of the union do n't have it , you can very well expect the e.u. 
  as a whole not to bother . 
   ** these rights shall find their limits ** no , it does n't . 
   there has never been a bigger window of opportunity for fn than this year . 
  refugee crisis , eu trying to cope with brexit , the american government playing good-cop-bad-cop with the eu , terrorism and how is macron going to prevent resolve any of this ? 
  heck if by the next time britain brexits successfully , fn is going to be in an even better place . 
  so if every year the number of fn voters grow , what happens in 10 years ? 
  neither france , nor germany have the freedom of expression as a right . 
  asking of the e.u. 
  to hold itself to such standards is an absurd request . 
  ** especially ** his banking chums . 
   if they do n't we 're going to get a two-speed europe or a core-europe or whatever you want to call it , but i think it is a fact that the tensions within the european institutions need to be resolved in some way . 
  permanently limping along is not an option . 
  have to admit , i 'd be fine with this - probably best case scenario as far as i 'm concerned . 
  outside of the economical factors , there are just things i 'd rather never share with some of the citizens of western europe ( gun laws , sin taxes and hate speech limitations more precisely ) . 
   either european countries commit to european values or they do n't . 
  and what if they do n't ? 
   we 've way too long pretended that we can be some laissez-faire union where you can basically run an illiberal government and just pick and choose the economic benefits without any political commitment . 
  you have economies as powerful as luxemburg to those as poor as bulgaria , with everything from germany to greece in-between . 
  you ca n't really work with anything but a big brush . 
  a good example is actually poland . 
  yes they have refused to accept syrian refugees , do you know what they have accepted ? 
  ukrainian refugees - a lot of them . 
  it 's not a simple matter . 
   well , getting rid of the alt-right le pen is definitely a plus . 
  yeah , if macron turns into hollande v2 .0 you 're going to see le pen vs melenchon ( i hope i 'm not butchering the names here ) . 
  do n't take refuge in her losing the election . 
  i would n't be so fast to celebrate . 
  macron asks from tax harmonization and sanctions on poland , if he decides to press the issue we might see more troubles ahead . 
  to be fair , some people could prefer the front national economical policies to that of macron . 
  that does n't mean they 'll check the `` leave '' box on lepen 's referendum . 
  in a way i wonder what would happen to fn if you remove / they win the election , but lose the referendum , is there anything more to that party ? 
  why not - it 's a democratic vote ? 
  the rage this day is the middle east . 
  i say pick up the americans and fuck up iran . 
  100 % nothing could go wrong . 
  i went with google 's numbers as to not start a debate on that issue . 
  look , the median income in bulgaria is 1400 euro , a lot of people are working for less , with the minimum wage being 356 euro . 
  you put the tax levels of germany or france on us and it 's over , people would either lose too much of their income to live , you 'd have nullgaria in a month . 
  would n't even be a referendum , they 'd just set the national assembly on fire . 
  edit : and before someone says it - 1 ) this will `` trickle down '' and 2 ) it will open the gateways to further `` harmonization '' . 
  they do n't have to leave the e.u. 
  to elect le pen - she promised a referendum , not frexit . 
  even if she manages to get herself elected , i doubt the `` second round '' voters will vote leave . 
  even if she loses this one , i 'm actually certain that le pen is going to win next one . 
  frankly macron has antagonized the polish and irish , putting him on the eu table is going to accelerate eu resentment . 
  [ this is bill maher admitting they were defacing republicans for decades . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxkik7b0owc ) they 're doing the same thing with trump now . 
  i 'm willing to bet you money that in eight years , when president pence is elected , you 'll see all those people that are thrashing trump now say how he was `` secular and unreasonable and we miss him '' . 
  i do n't think it 's `` calm down '' more like `` got a briefed up on the situation '' . 
  most of the things we see actually took dacades to make and are legacy programs carrying on . 
  sometimes ( often ) things that are unpopular are good for the nation ( any nation ) , so many politicians just continue down the road , once they have to act , rather than talk . 
  [ wan na see something sad ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmnsp4qexnm ), 
  ... yes , in 100 days trump has toppled the war in iraq , hurricane katrina and the financial collapse of 2008 . 
  it 's just going to go the way of the muslim black box - a.k.a rebuild it and pretend nothing ever happened to it . 
  that 's just not a fair assessment of the e.u. 
  minor members are n't isolated , we all play an active part in this . 
  first - how did we got here ? 
  second - it does provide a better negotiating position for places like bulgaria or romania ( or poland ) , which are simply too small to matter in international policy . 
  personally there are things i dislike as well , but i 'm not at a stage where i want to topple the whole thing , because of them . 
  i 'm just answering your question - you do you . 
  personally i retreat into the delusion of bulgaria becoming a first world nation someday . 
  it makes the day easier , but i always cry in the mornings . 
  ( for those that did n't get it , that 's a joke ), 
  i actually find him pretty charismatic - as long as you do n't think about what he 's saying . 
  it 's probably better this way , as labor or anyone else would just muddy the waters during negotiations . 
  because you compare yourself to new york and not zimbabwe . 
  frankly , this whole map tells you very little .
