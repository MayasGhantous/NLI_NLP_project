  for example look at `` time not at work '' - does that include the `` paid vacation '' and `` maternity leave '' ? 
  because if it does , then that means that overall life in america might be more leasurly , when excluding those non-productive days . 
  also on the problem with maternity - if `` time not at work '' includes maternity leave , than the chart is pretty useless for about half the population , a.k.a it 's better to be a man in the u.s. , than in europe . 
  huh ... my bad on this one . 
   it 's clear that only macron has any semblance of understanding high-school level economics . 
  macron 's platform is to increase benefits and pump the government ( you can hear it in this debate as well - building new hospitals was one ) , while cutting taxes . 
  basically they 're both promising pixie dust . 
  just a reminder that whomever you vote for , many citizens in your nation are voting for the other person for their own reason . 
  though you might disagree , we should remember to be respectful . 
  for everyone wondering , i still have ptsd from the american election , please be nice to each other . 
  a lot ( most , vast majority ) of that money gets stolen . 
  furthermore , i think it 's insulting to say that without the e.u. 
  the eastern nations would be some kind of an eternal hell . 
  even serbia and moldova have had consistent gdp growth . 
  absolutely true , but would it have happened to the degree that it has ? 
  maybe , maybe not . 
  i 'm not saying that i want us out of the `` freedom of movement '' ( even though that 's the logical conclusion from my statement ) , just that i 'm bitter about it . 
  people were leaving en-mass even before we joined the e.u. 
   is this because young people are leaving their countries to work in western-europe ? 
  that and low birth-rates . 
   instead of bringing the countries closer together is n't the eu funding a brain-drain yeah , i have to admit i 've grown somewhat bitter and resentful of the `` free movement of people '' , because 1/3 of our working population has left the country and those of us that stayed are going to be stuck with a very grim bill . 
   essentially supports the corrupt ruling elite in these countries instead of fighting it ? 
  yes . 
  please stop giving us money , nothing of that `` trickles down '' and it just makes the corruption worse . 
  i do n't know what numbers they fudge in brussels but the on-ground reality is not good . 
   all those who remain are part of the system or unable to leave it ... wo n't it eventually implode by not being able to pay the pensions/bills without constant eu support ? 
   i hear many young people from central/eastern-europe who 'll likely never return because of the lack of opportunities and corruption ( not being able to get a job unless you join the system ) . 
  the estimates of the imf is that bulgaria will reach parity with the average of european nations ( not the top , but the average ) in standard of living around 2040 . 
  today many opportunities are created ( and have been since the fall of communism ) , since 1990 the average income of the bulgarian has increased 3x . 
  that being said i do not blame individually anyone who left . 
  bulgaria is still the poorest nation in the union , it 's hard to justify staying up to help lift up the country ( and yes , that does n't happen because of `` savior '' , that happens because many people work hard ) , when you can essentially move westwards and have the life you 'll have to wait 20-30 years for . 
  we also have this absolutely toxic mentality that if you have the skills you ** should ** move . 
  i 've been told both by my teachers , my principle and career advisers , that i should move to `` europe '' and get a good life . 
  there is also an additional factor to the demographic that could turn the situation from bad to worse , but that 's a different thing . 
  that being said - even with the people living - the situation is improving as of now , what that 'd mean in 30 years time is hard to assess . 
  taking the above in mind , it 's not said that all tales ** must ** have a good ending and this could turn into a very sore spot for those in the east . 
  i think immigration was on the table ? 
  did n't you blokes refuse to take refugees ? 
  greece calling banks `` tables '' explains so much . 
  on a related note - i 'm disappointing i did n't see `` macron '' on france . 
  . a few hundred thousand here and there do add up to a pretty heavy sum . 
  . a few hundred thousand here and there do add up to a pretty heavy sum . 
  i do n't think it 's just lobbies . 
  those companies employ a lot of people and bring a lot of money to the treasury . 
  if they suffer , a lot of people may find thmeslves unemployed and germany might suffer a gdp cut . 
  even funnier when one of them becomes president . 
  out of curiosity - who exactly belongs in the e.u ? 
  no matter how you look at it , the empire was bringing freedom to alderaan . 
   high skilled professionals do n't have this problem . 
  a computer programmer from poland is probably just as good as one from france , but not a lot cheaper . 
  they basically cost the same . 
  that 's an outright lie . 
  in bulgaria the it sector is booming , because companies are outsourcing more and more work to us . 
  i doubt it . 
  until recently there was n't the political will , but ... brexit did n't happen in isolation . 
  wielders also gained more seats in the dutch government than he used to have . 
  there are growing concerns with the european union which - whatever you like it or not - must be addressed . 
  even if macron wins , that does n't mean you wo n't get a fn victory next time around . 
  this is vital for the e.u. 
  as without france their budget is going to go to absolute hell , germany itself can not bankroll europe . 
  ukip is somewhat libertarian in many cases and has a bad reputation - deserving or not . 
  liberal democrats , from what i know , are not really all there on brexit . 
  now whatever your opinion on brexit might be , voters want a stable and strong leadership , which may has provided so far . 
  right now a lot of european companies are outsourcing to bulgaria , the sector is exploding . 
  on the good side - you 're going to be paid a lot relatively to most bulgarians , on the bad side it 's still bellow the minimum wage in some nations . 
   why should we buy anything bulgarian you buy anything bulgarian ? 
   if bulgaria is prioritizing bulgarian companies . 
  it 's not . 
  the bulgarian government is prioritizing bulgarian companies , that does n't mean private businesses would not prefer to have access to swedish / danish / french products . 
   for the free market to work it needs to be free , you can not have any country giving it 's own companies advantages . 
  so would that mean cutting off subsidies to green energy ? 
   bulgaria buys pens from france but france uses bulgarian builders to build their houses . 
  that 's not an equal exchange . 
  the money from those pens is going to france to pay for the french workers making pencils and in the pockets of french capitalists . 
  in the case of the workers those people are going to stay in france and spend their money on the french market . 
   in the end it 's a win win but some companies will have a hard time and others will thrive but that would be the case otherwise too . 
  yes , the problem is i do n't want my country to become outsource central where we 're the china of europe . 
   bulgaria is profiting a lot both socially and economically from the free marked , the schengen and eu . 
  i 'm not against the e.u. 
  or an isolationist , i just think that it 's good for a government to use local resources whenever possible . 
  i do n't think it 's a radical idea , especially considering the vast majority of consumption is done by private citizens . 
  he did push the reusable rockets envelop and is building the infrastructure for mass electric vehicles with tesla . 
  there 's massive hype with the guy , but he 's done a lot as well . 
  i 'm not arguing about cheaper prices , i 'm very well aware that it 'd be more expensive this way . 
  probably drive up corruption as well . 
   and what if every country did the same with germany only buying from germany and sweden only buying from sweden ? 
  why not ? 
  would n't be bad for the government to help local business whenever possible . 
   we need it for stability ( i would hate to go back to when all of europe was fighting with each other ) and because it drives the economy of all of europe . 
  if you think europe is going to start ww3 , because government used locally produced goods you 're out of your mind . 
  i do n't want all the revenue going to paris or berlin , our local governments helping our local communities is a good thing . 
  and no `` helping '' does n't only mean welfare . 
  not him ( obviously ) , but henry kissinger discusses this in his book `` diplomacy '' . 
  yeah , but that 's an ** if ** , i do n't think there 's an actual chance of it happening . 
  well , i mean if 50 + % of the french want to leave , should n't they ? 
  i 'm actually going to go with the 4 % . 
  lepen has promised a referendum , not a frexit - even if she 's elected that thing is n't going to pass . 
  painfully accurate , if talking about the union only , but if you 're to include russia , moldova , kosovo and albania ... it 'd still be accurate . 
  have an upvote , you made me laugh . 
  f-35  eurofighter , let 's not pretend the americans are n't the best in the business .
