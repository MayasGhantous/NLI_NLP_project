  they are richer than most of europe . 
  perhaps they can afford more non-staple foods ? 
   preferably break up the euro because some countries are simply too/not enough competitive . 
  good luck with that . 
  that seems excessive . 
  provided they are maintained well , they offer cheap and efficient housing . 
  if insulated and painted , they do n't look so bad either . 
  fractions looked quite ugly so i multiplied everything by 1000 to get more friendly-looking numbers . 
  for the us , there would be 244 dogs per 1000 people [ 1 ] , higher than in any eu country . 
  the figure for russia is just 65 dogs . 
  [ 2 ] only greece likes dogs less than russia :( i ca n't find a definitive figure for china at all . 
  [ 1 ] https://www.statista.com/statistics/198100/dogs-in-the-united-states-since-2000/ [ 2 ] https://www.statista.com/statistics/515543/dog-population-europe-russia/, 
  pretty shocking we were at 57.6 % in 2007 . 
  and then 41.1 % in 2008 . 
  i wish the pre-crisis rates of economic growth would return . 
  at 6-7 % year things were looking really good . 
  at 3 % it 's going to take forever to catch up :(, 
  when all media is pro-putin and alternative view points are not available , that will tend to happen . 
  plus , russia never developed a pluralistic political culture . 
  i do n't think putin would be that popular in a russia with functioning democratic institutions and independent media . 
  it does overlook a part of the gypsy ghetto but it 's pretty in winter . 
  russia is quite authoritarian . 
  there is close to 0 % chance of a peaceful transfer of power there until putin is alive . 
  their elections are a sham and opposition is actively suppressed . 
  media is entirely controlled by the government and oligarchs with connections to the government . 
  the duma is effectively a rubber-stamp institution . 
  indeed . 
  i do n't see any correlation between percentage of births outside of marriage and quality of life . 
  i seriously doubt the 4.6 m employed figure for romania ( population 19m ) , considering we have 3m with a population of 7m . 
  it 's very possible the methodology used is very different . 
  my money is on greece and croatia being more religious/conservative than bulgaria . 
  i think the former , looking at turkey 's score , 
   you are just contradicting yourself or you are trying the put blame on the ottomans especially . 
  to your logic being in sfry should be the largest influence on your education and literacy whilst as you can see in the map it is n't . 
  no , that would be your logic , as you mentioned that education is mostly determined by recent policies ( you gave an example with the 80s and the 90s ) . 
  as you can see , slovenia and macedonia , despite being part of yugoslavia throughout most of the 20th century ( including the 80s and 90s ) , and presumably subject to similar educational policies , are incredibly different in their average mathematical achievement . 
  therefore that largely refutes your claim that recent history is the main driver of educational achievement . 
  it is obviously not so , and there is a deeper background influence . 
  i attributed it to the ottomans , as the borders match so well , but , as i said , you are welcome to provide a different explanation . 
   you can explain croatia 's score just by the austrian influence and later austrian rule over croatia instead of other factors and their policies . 
  this is just ridiculous . 
  i do believe it affects the general mindset and culture of the population , which in turn affects the general economy and policy of the country . 
  i do not see how that is controversial . 
  one can see a [ similar phenomenon ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poland_a_and_b ) in poland , which can ultimately be traced to the historical territorial holdings of prussia and russia in modern poland . 
  it is not just about the educational policies , that 's the thing . 
  it 's the peoples ' general mindset , which changes much more slowly than policies and economies do . 
  now , i am no expert in the area , but i 'd welcome an explanation into why very low educational achievement in europe is confined exclusively within the territories of the former ottoman empire . 
  to me the correlation is just too large to disregard . 
  i doubt solely the educational policies of the 80s and 90s can explain this , as greece was on the `` western '' side of the iron curtain , and yet , it 's much closer to bulgaria 's score than , say , italy 's or spain 's . 
  same with the former yugoslavian states -- how come macedonia ( conquered by the ottomans ) scores so low , while slovenia ( not conquered ) is overachieving ? 
  no , of course i am not blaming them directly , but you ca n't deny the correlation . 
  also , 5 centuries under ottoman rule do n't just fade away in a century and a half . 
  south-eastern european culture is still very influenced by its ottoman past . 
  we have some very strong performers , that 's true . 
  but outside of the few `` elite '' schools , the average joe is basically a mathematical illiterate . 
  ottoman empire , not even once . 
  bulgaria is very polarized regarding russia and there 's a large russophile segment of the population ( you ca n't escape the cultural similarities between the two countries ) . 
  in my observations , most young and educated people do not share that view , and that 's who you would meet in reddit . 
  older people are massively pro-russia though , and there are many of them . 
  gypsies do have a higher birth rate but it 's far from 5 children per family . 
  we are pretty good at growth . 
  percentage growth is easier when you are starting from a lower base .

  the rent situation in romania sounds quite different . 
  you can get a decent one bedroom in sofia for 250 eur , a shit one for 200 . 
  the average net salary is about 500 eur , giving you 200-250 eur to play with after bills . 
  definitely not a lot , but quite survivable . 
  in varna , a one bedroom goes for 100-150 eur and the net average salary is about 350 eur . 
  that still gives you some disposable , although i would n't call it `` good '' living . 
  if you 're only making min . 
  wage , you got no choice but to stay with your parents . 
  i guess that 's why most people only leave their parents in their 30s ... 
  250 euros for a single-bedroom apartment seems high . 
  was that in bucharest ? 
  because salaries are much higher in bucharest ( i 'd imagine ) , making up for the higher cost of rent . 
  plus , romania has an [ insane home ownership rate ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/246355/home-ownership-rate-in-europe/ ) . 
  i 'd imagine most people already own a home , making renting less necessary than in the west . 
  [ energy is really not eu-priced ] ( https://www.sust-it.net/europe-energy-costs.php ) . 
  it is n't at the price level for the country either , but somewhere in between . 
  and yes , overall , life in the west is still better for the average person . 
  i never disputed that really , i was just trying to show that things are n't as bad in our home countries as they would seem in purely nominal terms . 
  a lot of your consumption is housing , services , and essentials , all of which scale very well to the price level of the country . 
  yes , cars and smartphones do not , but that 's a pretty small chunk of total consumption . 
  irredentism explains a lot of the choices bulgaria made in ww1 and ww2 . 
  the country that emerged after the unification of the principality with east rumelia possessed only a portion of the territory inhabited by ethnic bulgarians as proposed in the [ san stefano treaty ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_of_san_stefano#/media/file:bulgaria-sanstefano_-\\ ( 1878 \\ ) - bytodorbozhinov.png ) . 
  we sided with whomever promised the strongest territorial gains . 
  it was germany both times . 
  in contrast , romania already included pretty much all ethnic romanians after the treaty of trianon in 1920 , so there was no real drive for irredentism . 
   about gdp : first of all , that map is wrong . 
  secondly , it 's better nominal gdp per capita which is not distorted by inflation your map is a forecast for 2017 while his is for 2016 . 
  you ca n't compare the two . 
  also , gdp ppp is the only way to get a remotely accurate perception of effective income levels , and has nothing to do with inflation . 
  nominal gdp is nearly useless for comparisons . 
  a one bedroom apartment costs $ 250/mo in sofia and # 1500 in london . 
  all ppp means is that these price differences ( and others ) are taken into account . 
  please read the [ relevant wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/purchasing_power_parity ) . 
  why is thrace white on the map ? 
  no data ? 
  yes , i agree with you , for germany and most other developed countries progressive taxation makes more sense . 
  it 's not absurd .
