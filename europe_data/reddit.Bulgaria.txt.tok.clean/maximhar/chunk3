  it 's the same in bulgaria , and for similar reasons -- in a developing economy you do n't have a safe `` base '' of highly-paid workers you can tax . 
  you also have weaker institutions making tax collection harder at higher levels . 
  thirdly , both countries have pretty low levels of inequality and do n't really need to do wealth redistribution in huge amount . 
  the event has 1k `` going '' but from the looks of it it was closer to 200-300 . 
  the event was organised on facebook and the admins are bulgarian . 
  a few anticorruption parties also participated ( this photo is taken from `` da , bulgaria !, 
  '' - s facebook page ) . 
  unfortunately all comments containing links to facebook get autodeleted so i ca n't share it here :(, 
  eastern europe would still be poorer on average if communism never happened , but the gap would be far less stark . 
  for example , look at ireland , which had half the gdp/capita of the uk back then , and is way ahead now . 
  or scandinavia , which went from somewhat poor to very rich . 
  the protest took place today at 5 pm next to the romanian embassy in sofia .

  we have a few of those anticorruption parties . 
  they will be lucky if they get a combined 10 % share in the next elections , and probably none will pass the threshold , because in bulgaria populism wins the day , as most people do n't care about anyone else but themselves and their immediate family . 
   they should all be doing 4 % or more to converge with western europe and yet not a single one of them are . 
  well , what you really care about is gdp per capita which is growing faster as eastern countries have lower population growth . 
  it looks like the majority of eu eastern europe has managed to avoid it already . 
  let 's hope we do too . 
  i agree . 
  location is a big factor . 
  russia also has a powerful oligarchy which a big chunk of the gdp is funneled into . 
  ditto for productivity . 
  the vast majority of your consumption is not iphones . 
  a smartphone is a once-in-a-year buy , and that 's stretching it . 
  no definition is perfect . 
  productivity and income correlate strongly , but yeah , you 're right . 
  i do n't think russia is catching up to latvia in any meaningful way . 
  once you include inequality , they are much worse off still . 
  the average russian is poorer than the average latvian , even if the per capita figures point toward the opposite . 
  as you can see [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_income_equality#/media/file:2014_gini_index_world_map,_income_inequality_distribution_by_country_per_world_bank.svg ) latvia is much more equal than russia , which more than makes up for the small difference in the per capita gdp . 
  nominal gdp per capita is nearly useless for country-to-country comparison as it does n't take local prices into account . 
  therefore it does not at all reflect quality of life . 
  ppp is an adjustment that 's done according to the price to a whole basket of goods and services . 
  it has ( almost ) nothing to do with inflation ( which is roughly uniform across the eu anyway ) . 
  it means exactly that , if we define `` richness '' as local purchasing power . 
  if a romanian lived in south italy with their romanian income , yes , they would be poorer , but that is largely irrelevant for estimating the quality of life . 
  curiously , even though we 're the poster boys , we 've experienced a fairly robust growth nonetheless ( especially romania ) , in contrast with croatia which has pretty much stagnated . 
  i feel there are other factors in play here , not just corruption . 
  check out [ this article ] ( http://voxeu.org/article/how-rich-nations-benefit-eu-membership ) for a fairly thorough analysis . 
  it 's \u0432\u0430\u0434\u0430 , not \u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 , which means a small stream . 
  brook seemed like an appropriate translation . 
  should have mentioned i was n't aiming to be 100 % factual , i guess . 
  also , \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430 indeed comes from bulgarian and not russian and means `` pretty '' . 
  i checked this one :d, 
  they have a ridiculously tiny ( in a good way ) central government , which probably helps a lot . 
  a lot of power is delegated to the cantons . 
  also , no state healthcare -- it 's all private health insurance . 
  no , i was quoting the nominal gdp/capita for 2015 . 
  at ppp it 's lower , at about 39k , but i agree that it 's not very relevant . 
  [ source .

  i think we should encourage them to take education more seriously so their kids can grow up to become productive citizens . 
  we are never going to solve the vast wealth gap otherwise . 
  it looks they have rather [ harsh taxes ] ( http://www.worldwide-tax.com/slovenia/slovenia_tax.asp ) . 
  `` general government spending generally consists of central , state and local governments , and social security funds . '', 
  [ oecd ] ( https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-spending.htm ), 
  uks gdp per capita is not 45k ( was 41k in 2015 , but it will drop like a rock in 2016 because of the fall in the pound ) . 
  the gypsy minority - pretty much so . 
  but after the mating period is over they leave for western europe with their kids so all that sweet growth is wasted :(, 
  the bulgarian president has very limited powers . 
  i am sure he wants a bulgarian space program too . 
  indeed . 
  i 'm worried about the parliamentary elections later this year though - a bsp majority would be a disaster . 
  for one , poland mysteriously did n't get seriously affected by the great recession . 
  they did n't experience a single quarter of negative growth . 
  i still wonder * how * they managed it , but the result is that they retained their previous growth , while most other ee countries had 1-2 `` lost '' years . 
  in most of london , water is really hard ( as in , has a lot of mineral content ) . 
  this makes it taste bad , but it 's perfectly drinkable . 
  just ruins your washing machine , 
  do n't be silly . 
  how can there be weather in a place that 's not real ? 
  the author mentions on his facebook page that he uses dji phantom 4 pro . 
  does that help ? 
  i loved the idea , sadly [ my photoshop skills are n't exactly top notch ... ] ( https://s28.postimg.org/jotpku4rh/attack_on_sofia.png ), 
  spain and romania both speak romance languages , both are predominantly christian , both used to be part of the roman empire . 
  that 's quite a bit of things in common . 
  yup , [ they are quite beyond ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/russland_topo.png/1920px-russland_topo.png ) the caspian sea . 
  among bulgarians it 's popular to diss our country for everything , but highways are something we have been doing pretty well at . 
  we actually have more highways/person than poland ( 85km vs 112km per million ) , and a lot are in construction . 
  i do n't consider that too bad , taking into account the difficult terrain in many places . 
  sure , and their highways probably took more effort to build , too . 
  to be fair , it 's much harder to build highways in bulgaria . 
  like 50 % of the country is mountains . 
  poland is really flat , on the other hand . 
  edit , because downvotes , here is a comparison : [ poland ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/polska_relief.jpg ) , [ bulgaria ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/bulgarien_en.png ),

  i do n't think we have people who speak pure serbian as their first language , however , we have a bunch of areas in the west with the [ torlakian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torlakian_dialect ) dialect , which is between serbian and bulgarian . 
  as a bulgarian , it 's not hard to understand most south slavic languages , as well as russian . 
  speak , not so much . 
  keep in mind this study is based on self-reported fluency , so it 's to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  i am by no means denying the * possibility * , but : * romanian language back in the early middle ages was probably significantly different than modern romanian , and it 's hard to draw conclusions without looking at the version of romanian that existed back then . 
  modern romanian has been influenced by slavic and hungarian too much to definitively dismiss a slavic or hungarian source for `` cr\u0103ciun '' . 
  * it is just as possible that bulgarian received the word from one of the other romanised tribes in the bulgarian state , or byzantium , or even through knyaz boris ' brief flirtation with rome . 
  it 's hard to say . 
  edit : formatting . 
  i suppose it 's entirely possible that a large christian minority existed in romania since long before official christianisation took place . 
  but along that line of thought , the same phenomenon could have given rise to the latin-derived term for christmas in bulgaria . 
  the bulgarian state encompassed a diverse range of people , some of which , for example the thracians , were probably romanised to an extent .
