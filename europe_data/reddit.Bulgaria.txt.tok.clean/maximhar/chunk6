   not to mention they have a functioning anti-corruption agency which is just going to propel the shit out of them and their economy i agree that will help their future performance , but they were doing better back in 2005-2007 , when we had similar levels of corruption . 
  obviously it 's a complex problem . 
   also , we had a lot of room to grow . 
  in the 1990s we were third world level poor . 
  so were we . 
  we might have been better off right after 1990 , but we had a hyperinflation and a devastating recession in the mid 90s , wiping out any advantage we had over you . 
  i can see two clear differences , we are pegged to the euro , whereas you have control over your monetary policy , and we are under a lot of shady russian influence , which is not the case with you . 
  looks like you were growing faster even before the eu . 
  i have no idea how , i wish we knew your secret :(, 
  the data is misleading in a way . 
  it looks like you 're starting ~ 2 % behind bulgaria in 2005 , but then you take off in 2007 and 2008 , in the midst of the global recession . 
  seemed odd , so i checked population data , and indeed , it looks like you had a census or something in 2008 ( https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/romania-population.png?s=rom+sp.pop.totl&amp;v=201702141642v&amp;d1=20070101&amp;d2=20171231 ) , which dropped your population figure by 500k compared to 2007 . 
  if you were to correct for that drop for the previous years , your gdp/capita ends about 2 % higher , putting it roughly on par with bulgaria in 2005 . 
   but everything else like food and electronics is cheaper in germany with their astronomical wages . 
  not really . 
  electronics is pretty much the same , or minimally cheaper ( because germany is a larger market , and prices of electronics are in us$ ) . 
  food is definitely not cheaper , the fact that someone saw a chocolate bar on discount in german lidl does n't mean food is cheaper overall . 
  here , berlin and sofia [ compared ] ( https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=bulgaria&amp;country2=germany&amp;city1=sofia&amp;city2=berlin&amp;tracking=getdispatchcomparison ) . 
  note that berlin is considered relatively cheap by german standards . 
   i 'm talking about our wages , something really important for every day of our existence , but okay . 
  well , a bulgarian family can rent a 2 bedroom apartment in sofia for 300 eur , do you think such a flat would cost 300 eur in oslo ? 
  norwegians are still way richer , but their prices are way higher too . 
  you ca n't compare without taking prices as well as wages into account . 
   but not one country was 7 times richer than another country back there . 
  and not one is now , either . 
  norway is n't even in the eu , but their gdp/capita ppp is about 3 times ours , not 7 . 
   small business owners need locals to buy their services and bulgarians consumers are n't as wealthy . 
  it 's about stability and outlook too . 
  disposable income is growing fast , taxation is low and staying that way in the foreseeable future , and the labour market is more flexible . 
   at least in the shitty soviet union , every country was almost equally poor , you got ta give russia credit for this . 
  should have known you 're a troll . 
  tell me more about how bulgaria and the czech republic were equally poor back then . 
   the minimum wage in south fucking africa is 140 euro , here is 220 euro - slightly better . 
  comparing the richest country in africa with the poorest in the eu , and we still come out on top ? 
  what 's your argument exactly ? 
   honestly , the eu is not even trying to help us fight the corruption even a little bit . 
  greece is corrupt as fuck in some ways , tax evasion there is a national pastime . 
  nah , i agree , your standard of living is still higher , but the gap is closing every year and we 'll probably have parity in 5 years or so with the current trend . 
  if you 're a small business owner you 'd almost certainly be better off in bulgaria , too . 
  yet the russians are the largest immigrant community in bulgaria , whereas bulgarian migration to russia is nonexistent ... 
  quality of life is more than gdp/capita , although i agree , i do n't think we 've caught up to greece just yet . 
   rough translation : not only are the greek companies that are massively `` emigrating '' to neighboring bulgaria . 
  from a report by greek tv sky , we learn that more and more greeks are also interested in acquiring bulgarian citizenship . 
  * the migration of greek companies to bulgaria is a phenomenon well known in recent years . 
  but from a reportage on greek tv sky , it is also clear that greek citizens are already interested in acquiring bulgarian citizenship . 
  for more details , we contacted the greek journalist zoo katzjayanaki and the bulgarian lawyer boris harizanov . 
  * more and more greeks accept bulgarian citizenship or are considering such a move , according to the report of the greek tv sky . 
  according to the authors , their main motives are lower taxes and higher pay in bulgaria . 
  report editor zoo katzjayanaki tells that after thousands of greek companies have opened subsidiaries in recent years or have registered in bulgaria , journalists have recently found a similar trend among the greeks themselves . 
  the sky tv team has only 14 such cases in recent times and the report says more than 200 greek citizens are currently waiting for bulgarian citizenship . 
  it is not good for greece that its citizens , along with their companies and their capital , are withdrawing to bulgaria , said in this connection zoi katzayanaki , adding : `` we have been in an economic crisis for seven years . 
  during this time , 12,000 greek companies moved to bulgaria . 
  this trend definitely damages our economy . '', 
  ** `` in greece , survival is hard work '' ** asked how he assesses the standard and quality of life in southern bulgaria compared to northern greece , zoe katsjayanaki says : `` of course , in bulgaria the standard of living is higher . 
  the greeks who work there get more , because in greece taxes are 50 % and in bulgaria only 10 % . '', 
  did the people in greece get angry with those countrymen who are looking for a better life beyond the border ? 
  `` they are angry because of the situation in greece itself , but do not get angry at those who leave . 
  because it is logical : do you have to survive ? 
  and in greece , survival is hard work , `` says katzayanaki . 
  bulgarian lawyer boris harizanov works with greek companies registered in bulgaria . 
  according to him , the `` tidal wave '' we are currently seeing is easy to explain : `` because the business climate in greece is not good . 
  there seems to be a state against the business . 
  and whether he is going to be an entrepreneur or just a person who wants to stay in the country , including the pensioners - is profitable for them in bulgaria , because with a greek pension in our country one can live quite happy . '', 
  boris harizanov has law firms in sofia and petrich and an accountancy house in petrich . 
  he works mainly with small greek companies - in the areas of services , it , trade and transport . 
  harizanov and his colleagues help greek entrepreneurs to orient themselves in bulgaria and to adapt to the business rules in the country . 
  `` from the point of view of security : yes , they feel safe here because the bulgarian legislator has clearly outlined their rights and obligations in the country . 
  and the greek entrepreneur knows very well what he would pay as taxes in the next year or in a shorter period . 
  that is exactly what they lack in greece . '', 
  ** bulgaria benefits ** and what is the benefit for the bulgarian treasury from the presence of greek companies in the country ? 
  to that question , harizanov answers : `` i can tell you that our companies have millions of receipts , which are expressed not only in the payment of health insurance or pension benefits , but also from the dd and the distribution of the dividend , where also 5 % is taxed '' . 
  the authors of the sca report argue that - along with the greek companies - there are three groups of greek citizens : pensioners , employees and students . 
  many young greeks want to follow in bulgaria after their graduation to stay in the country - because they believe that there will be better chances for professional realization , said in the report of the greek tv sky . 
   was this thread not comparing london to all of bulgaria though ? 
  considering london is larger than bulgaria , that 's not a terribly flawed comparison . 
  i 'd say that in general london offers vastly more opportunities , perhaps just not in my specific area ( software development ) . 
  anyway , if you feel good in leicester , that is great . 
  you ca n't compare london to all of north america , the latter offers vastly more opportunities . 
  sadly yes , salaries are close to double in the us for example , but one ca n't just go to work in the us on a whim . 
  yes , but many of the well-paying tech jobs are located in london . 
  i have friends having a decent quality of life in west wales , on # 14k . 
   not talking about a lot of uneducated people that chose slavery life . 
  i think they are better being slaves in uk . 
  i agree , if you 're going to be picking strawberries , cleaning , working at a till , then the uk is the better choice for you , because you can save on rent by sharing a flat ( or even a room ) , and have money left over for food , and even be able to save up and go out every now and then . 
  but by a quality life i imagine having a decent flat to yourself , owning a car , being able to go out a couple times a week , and so on . 
  that 's quite difficult on # 25k or even # 30k in london . 
  on # 30k you have # 1970/mo left after taxes . 
  a 1 bedroom flat sets you back roughly # 1000 . 
  then you have council tax and bills , likely another # 150 or so . 
  # 300 for food , leaving you with # 520 . 
  you also need to pay for public transport , as it 's unlikely you 'd live close to work . 
  if you 're commuting zones 1-4 , that 's another # 200/mo . 
  leaving you with # 320 . 
  got student loans to pay off ? 
  own a car ? 
  you will have even less left over . 
  extortionate housing and transport costs . 
  used to study in the uk , but moved back to bulgaria after graduation . 
  i am only making about # 15k here , but salaries rise every year and almost everything excluding electronics and cars is way cheaper . 
  i get a higher quality of life than on # 25k in london ( that 's the starter salary i was offered there ) .
