  i believe we live on global community where everyone is free to express theirselves however they want . 
  i 'm not forcing anyone to learn bulgarian because noone is forcing me to learn english or spanish or german or russian . 
  i just like them and i think i can only benefit . 
  oh yeah , and bulgarian is official language in the european parliament so it 's not that bad . 
  and i really appreciate when foreigners try to learn bg . 
  it shows a true dedication and i respect that . 
  edit : by the way i read that some people think english is easy . 
  nope . 
  english is not easy , spanish is damn easy . 
  well if there 's one thing that all bulgarians are proud with , this is our history . 
  and our culture . 
  so we commemorate the many fallen soldiers fallen for the name and freedom of bulgaria . 
  on that day there are parades of batalions and machinery and people are reminded that if was n't for these brave unknown soldiers who gave their life , we would n't be here right now . 
  ask any bulgarian about the best historic moment of his country and he 'll probably say the fight at shipka peak , where bulgarian soldiers were outnumbered 10 times but did n't let the ottomans pass . 
  or the first balkan war when bulgaria used for the first time in the world a plane for bombing ( 1912 ) . 
  bulgaria is a country with a lot of national holidays - liberation day , labor day , army day , union day , independence day , national leaders day , education and culture day . 
  combine them with christmas , new year and easter and you have the answer why bulgarians are lazy ( despite the myth that you would hear that people are soooo hard-working ) . 
  love the pattern . 
  southern europe is still worst at something , this time it is unemployment rate . 
  and yes , i count bulgaria as a southern country sometimes ( mostly when it 's something bad ) . 
  the funny thing is spain , italy and greece are the worst but bulgarians still choose these countries for their first choice when we talk about emigration ( second choice are nl and b ) . 
  now come the f * on . 
  this is 21st century , you ca n't just march in a country and claim the territory . 
  i thought this ended back in 1944 . 
  damn russians and their blind faith . 
  care to share your opinion why they should n't ? 
  kompot but blended into juice . 
  actually bulgaria was so in debt to the ussr that the communist leaders back then officially proposed to the union to become the 16th soviet republic . 
  luckily the whole thing fell apart a year or two later in 1989 . 
  yes , they are more productive than i actually expected . 
  i honestly laughed at the first one . 
  yeah ... do n't count on that . 
  we 're closer to india and iran than russia . 
  you could just prepare some for yourself . 
  you need sweet fruits ( like peach for example ) , a lot of sugar and water . 
  you put about 3 cut peaches ( cubes or whatever ) , 7-9 spoons of sugar ( spoons for soup , not teaspoons ) and fill it up with water . 
  this must happen in glass jar with hermetized cap . 
  then you boil the shit out of it ( put the jar in water ) and when you are done , just wait to cool down and with the blender you can make some . 
  now we 're talking about eco and bio . 
  when people hear where i am from they immediately start to make fun of the way locals pronounce it . 
  it 's funny because i use it like intelligence filter . 
  without studying you 'll just waste your time . 
  toefl is passable but it is the degree that is important and you ca n't get high results if you do n't study hard for a couple of months . 
  of course depends where are you from and what uni are you applying for . 
  nope . 
  here on the media it 's a big deal but people actually do n't care because they think `` eu brought us nothing '' . 
  and they want bg to want the euroasian economic union with kazakhstan and russia . 
  yep . 
  here in bulgaria people do n't have many stereotypes about scandinavians ( finland and iceland included ) because they are very distant . 
  but here is known that they are rich and they are smart and they have everything working just fine . 
  a lot of them come as alcohol tourists in sunny beach and inject a lot of money in this shithole called resort . 
  but hey - the booze is cheap and the girls are easy here . 
  and my personal opinion is that if i knew any of the languages in the scandinavian countries i would love to be a part of scandinavian country ( sweden is my first choice ) . 
  have n't met scandinavians so do n't have opinions on people specifically . 
  yeah . 
  bulgaria scored worst position in eu and in it 's history . 
  at least it 's a pretty number : / and i am personally ofended in being at that place in my pov of proffesional journalist . 
  i know , right ? 
  roma/gypsy people are about 8-10 % of the population but still there is this thing that all our neighbours are bad and we are the best . 
  * like every balkan country . 
  the question is how are romanians viewed here . 
  and i give the stereotype . 
  from my pov ukrainian girls are easy , ukrainian boys are \u0434\u0435\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438 . 
  and they are in our country because of the eu passports . 
  a lot of stereotypes here . 
  i come from the border city rousse and romanians actually are quite welcome because of their touristy type . 
  i still ca n't erase the image how a male bought five lcd tvs back in 2007 and stacked them in the back of his [ old dacia ] ( http://auta5p.eu/katalog/dacia/dacia_1310_05.jpg ) . 
  ( not actual photo of stacking ) . 
  but still if you ask a bulgarian , he 'll probably say that romanians are gypsies and bad people ( and probably he never met a romanian but for sure asked his gypsy neighbour for a favor ) . 
  ** bulgaria ** * [ bulgarian journalists protested ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/159512/bulgarian+journalists+stage+solidarity+protest ) in front of the interior ministry 's headquarters in sofia , to show their solidarity for the second arson attack in six months on btv 's genka shikerova . 
  * the head of bulgarian state agency for national security ( dans ) vladimir pisanchev said the budget comission chief of sofia municipality was wiretaped . 
  * [ the ex conflict of interest comission chief filip zlatanov ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/159489/ex+conflict+of+interest+commission+chief+to+spend+3.5+years+in+prison ) will have to spend 3,5 years in prison because of `` very interesting notebook '' on his desk . 
  there was actually written who should zlatanov answer to when there are conflicts and the names were of some party leaders . 
  * parliament approved provisions favouring south stream gas pipeline though it is against eu regulations . 
  yeah , already discussed this [ here ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/21bwyl/swedes_are_the_sportiest_in_europe_while/ ) 5 days ago . 
  bulgaria raised 44 % to $ 3.6 in 5 years ( total of 7 in the eu ) . 
  and still here some people think that we do n't need eu and should ditch it and join our `` slavic brothers '' in the eurasian economic union . 
  some mps even said ( not officially ) that they would support that . 
  way to go , my fellow bulgarians ...  the lowest figures for memberships at a sport club are in romania ( 1 % ) , bulgaria ( 2 % ) ;  italy ( 3 % ) and bulgaria ( 2 % ) also have the fewest citizens who exercise or play sport regularly . 
  well this is the 21st century and everyone has the right to live wherever he wants and not be stopped by some formal boundaries . 
  since when croatia is 140 ? 
  last summer i was in dubrovnik and we were cruising from the serbian border with ~ 130 because 130 was the limit . 
  bulgaria . 
  because people pay money for this and there are smart enough people to grow beards and read passages from the bible . 
  it 's the same here . 
  i thought bulgaria ca n't get shittier . 
  thanks spiegel , now i know it can . 
  i do n't know about religion but you guys are doing good work with corruption . 
  it 's not about if the photographed material is interesting , it 's about how and where you distribute/share it . 
  so the salutation `` bro '' has different meaning now ... 
  people are scared when they meet new culture , new people , new life goals . 
  people are scared . 
  they have n't faced war , malnutrition and mass murders , rapes etc. 
  now they see it in the refugees ' eyes , it is written on their faces . 
  this is something unknown , eu citizens are unfamiliar with such a way of life ( if you can call it life ) , that 's why they are scared . 
  and also here in bulgaria locals think that along with the mothers and children proto-terrorists and rapers ( not rappers ) might come in the country since they have no documents to prove who they are ( so they might be just anyone ) . 
  he just gave an example , brat . 
  and it is n't even close , compared with the actual size of san marino , it 's like 5 san marinos between the actual country and the track . 
  people of san marino , what was it like in your country when formula 1 had a grand prix at imola ? 
  were there more tourists ?
