  was your country more famous back then ? 
  after all one of the greatest drivers died in your country . 
   you should post this in ** notmebutiknowsomeonewhoknowssomeone ** , you would get many more responses i imagine ftfy, 
  the guy because of whom reddit is kinda blocked in ru is the top tifu thread over at / r/tifu right now and the thread is even in the top 10 of all time of the sub . 
  for some britons romania and bulgaria apparently are a single country with two names . 
  that eu is deliberately making life worse along with the us so we should get the fuck away and get back with russia . 
  being placed as bulgarian among europeans is such a pride . 
  we are not a part of the archaic eastern bloc heavily influenced by the damn soviets or linked to the ottoman traditions . 
  my hometown is right across the border . 
  we always used to make fun of the poor ugly gypsy romanians who had nothing to eat ( literally , about 1981 ) . 
  then we laughed at them when they flocked in rousse to shop in kaufland and the tech stores . 
  now they are digging themselves out of the dirt . 
  too bad bulgarians are too near-sighted to see that romania is going ahead of us and still laugh about the same old jokes ( dacia-gypsy-gib bak klay ) . 
  actually the main reason for the forests to grow here is that there are not so many people in the rural places ( at least not as much as they were back * then * ) so there 's no one to actually get in the way of a forest to grow . 
  i choose my own country . 
  i am already used to with all the shit , why should i bother trying somewhere else to fit in with all the different shit ? 
   i never really understood people who go to clubs for their vacations . 
  we both know what kind of people go to clubs for their vacations here and we both know they are not a bit interested in the universe . 
  afaik they think the universe rotates around them . 
  soo reverse light polution ? 
  do n't worry . 
  our bike lanes are useless since if you have a bike that is more than 500 $ it will probably get stolen . 
  source : my fb feed filled with missing puppies or bikes . 
  you mean finland . 
  finland is n't real . 
  poor switzerland , not properly accepted anywhere :(, 
  you 're missing your flair , \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442 . 
  but if you close your eyes , does it almost feel like nothing chang . . oh not that bastille !, 
  kinda . 
  any other maps of other parts of the globe ? 
  moldova is so poor , they can not afford food thus they can not afford to be overweight . 
  well not really , because this is the border i was going after : http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/bulgaria_simeon_i_ ( 893-927 ) . svg/2000px-bulgaria _ simeon_i _ ( 893-927 ) . svg.png and i 'm not sure hungary would * gib bak * pest . 
  eh , close enough . 
  is this split ? 
  this totally looks like split . 
  on the map is [ hotel rodina \\ ( motherland \\ ) ] ( http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4014/4693412319_739977b37a_z.jpg ) 104 meters , but right now they are finishing [ capital fort ] ( http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm173/georgi_zhigalov/sl274508_zpscstqifgi.jpg ) at 125 meters . 
  poor eastern bloc , noone wants there . 
  i understand the participants at the baltimore riots are people who think something bad happened because the color of someone 's skin and they tend to play the racial/minority card for excuse to riot/protest/loot . 
  is n't this just another `` white cop-black victim '' case ? 
  like the one in ferguson ? 
  or like la in 1992 ? 
  yes , there is police brutality . 
  but why everyone is accenting what the color of the victim 's skin is ? 
  ca n't happen in bulgaria , not that massively . 
  once minorities start rioting police will use massive brutal force and will fuck them up big time . 
  riots can happen , but not by any of the minorities here ( gypsies , turks , refugees ) . 
  also the different countries in europe have more serious problems than the death of a single person so people would riot for proper education and healthcare and etc. 
  bulgarians used to smoke a lot . 
  about 65 % ( according to the national statistics institute ) . 
  now 35 % of bulgarians smoke more than a pack a day . 
  one of our primary exports in agriculture is tobacco . 
  but damn , the stigma is massive . 
  the law states that smoking is forbidden in closed areas . 
  but the law also states that a closed area is any place with 4 hard walls . 
  so now they just build `` aquariums '' for smokers with transparent pvc walls that are rolled up in sunny weather and rolled down when it 's cold . 
  a lot of people in the province/the poor parts of the country still smoke indoors but make self-made ashtrades from a glass and couple of ice blocks or a small vase or whatever . 
  since the law states that both the owner and the visitor should pay fines , bar owners just place these decorative vases and then in court tell that it was just for decoration and the visitor lighted a cigarette on his own . 
  the biggest problem in bulgaria is not applying the laws and that reflects in every aspect in the community , like the smoking problem - we have a law forbidding smoking indoors but the lack of applying it makes things not that good . 
  leisure , lol . 
  to clear everything up : ** tsar ** was the highest monarch title until the communists came . 
  so he was actively ruler ( well , with regents ) of bulgaria before 1944 . 
  one of the most successful pr campaigns of 2014 at our advertising agency was about the refugees from syria . 
  74 % of bulgarians do n't want refugees living in their neighbourhood and 64 % of bulgarians do n't want refugees living in bulgaria at all . 
  we did all we could to change this point of view but damn it 's hard since bulgarians are poor and uneducated and do n't know the difference between muslims , terrorists , refugees , skin-colored people etc. 
  it 's not that surprising with the british question since every student here dreams of going to uk because of various reasons . 
  because everything is just damn too simple and easy . 
  i was born in bulgaria , i was molded with challenges throughout my entire life , i would easily get bored in a country like usa . 
  when i was younger and our democracy was still single-digit-old some french people asked my sister ( while she was there ) if we had washing machines and ovens ... 
  but the most bizzare is that we have many bulls . 
  you know , because of bul-garia :|, 
  he did pretty well , you named your otopeni airport after him . 
  of course we do !!!!, 
  5 centuries of slavery !!!, 
  i live right across the border ( hometown is rousse ) and many times my parents told me that because of how romanians used to queueueue for hours in the communism they managed to pay their debts and that 's why they are having better progress than us . 
  i want to add something : at bnt ( bulgarian national television ) commercials are only allowed 6minutes per hour . 
  all the other ( non-state funded ) televisions get 20 minutes per hour . 
  also bnt can not have more than 2 minutes of advertising per commercial break . 
  so it 's mostly funded by the state . 
  side by side now , divided forever by bulgaria ^ ** gib ** ^ ** back ** ^ ** clay **, 
  better than the previous military alliance . 
  older people always used to tell us how in ww2 the german soldiers helped elders , played with kids and gave a hand for the housework in the houses they were sleeping . 
  both citizens and military understood that this is war and just have to wait until it blows over ( not the best use of words ) . 
  when the russians came they drank all the alcohol , destroyed many gardens for fruits and vegetables and ruined the newly paved roads by the germans with their tanks and etc. 
  when we joined nato the us army positioned some bases in southern bulgaria . 
  they redid the roads and always were polite in the local shops at the nearby villages . 
  we have the same politician here , some people even called him `` the bulgarian bismarck '' . 
  [ stefan stambolov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stefan_stambolov ) was the successor of our national hero and the apostle of freedom vasil levski in some revolutionary organisations . 
  then he was prime minister . 
  in his reign he opposed the monarch knyaz ferdinand for his pro-russian tendencies , unites the bulgarians in macedonia , borrows money from great britain and the austro-hungarian empire for improving the army , infrastructure and administration . 
  due to this just in 7 years 80 new factories are built around the country . 
  nowadays he is n't given as example because he opposed all pro-russians and cleared the army from russophiles . 
  but because of his authoritarian regime he loses control over the church and government . 
  he is assassinated in 1895 when he is attacked with pistol and yatagan ( special curved ottoman short sabre ) and now his monument is his head with massive cut . 
  he was known for always wearing bulletproof vest so that 's why the attackers attacked mostly his head . 
  of course we have buses , it 's just they are n't that big or yellow or systematized . 
  at the village where my grandfather is from , our neighbour had chavdar c-51 and used to drive the kids from our and the neighbouring villages to the county school . 
  then on his way back he got welfare food for the extremely poor ( people were already poor when i was younger ) . 
  when i was a student i used the public transport for 12 years . 
  as did all my classmates who lived more than 15 minutes walking distance away from school . 
  this made me check who is our representative in un .
