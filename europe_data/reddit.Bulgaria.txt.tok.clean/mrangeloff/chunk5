  never knew . 
  now i do . 
  that 's all i can attribute to this thread . 
  and still 43 % of the bulgarians want back the commie regime . 
  the sources are the telekoms and their sales departments . 
  and we both know how mobile phones are sold in bulgaria . 
  since all bulgarians studied russian in school until 1989 as a mandatory subject , it is not that hard for them to maintain a conversation . 
  and you should see how illiterate many russians are , they probably talk the same way , \u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0438 . 
  it 's funny because i probably do n't fall under this percentage because russian is my third language ( after bulgarian and english and before german and spanish ) .

  according to wiki , because blue is the colour of the dynasty that unified italy . 
  i guess it 's similar to the orange jerseys of netherlands . 
  some guy caught migrants on the bulgarian-turkish border , handcuffed them and yelled at them `` go back . 
  turkey .

  [ news source in english . 
  ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/173979/row+deepens+over+citizen%27s+arrests+of+migrants+in+bulgaria ) this is very controversial right now around the country because it 's not the first time someone who caught migrants arrested them without law and order , without police nearby or whatsoever . 
  the border patrols are on their full capacity but they ca n't keep up so citizens think it 's their duty to do the police 's job . 
  the problem - you ca n't handcuff someone just because you are stronger . 
  the deeper problem that bulgarian media does n't realize is that the police is not doing it 's job and the deepest problem is that the guys that shot these videos ( like i said it 's not the first time ) are former traffickers but now their `` business '' kinda went down the sink with so many policemen and media and people from the both sides of the border . 
  you win banitza and shopska salad on me when you come to sofia . 
  in bulgarian house is \u043a\u044a\u0449\u0430 alright . 
  i bet not many non-slavic foreigners ca n't say the letter \u044a nor the letter \u0449 and i do n't even want to think about combining them in a word next to each other . 
  you do know that wizz air has 25-30 $ one-way tickets to virtually all european countries , right ? 
  if you hate it somewhere , move . 
  you are not a tree .

  plevneliev 's official statement says : '' * i 'm deeply grieved of the news of the tragic incident that led to tens of victims and hundreds of wounded in a night club in bucharest . 
  iti s always hard to find words to represent the grief and empathy when young people are losing their lives . 
  bulgaria also lost several kids lives . 
  ^ 1 mr president , accept my sincere condolences for the bereavement and wishing fast recovery . 
  we are mourning with the people of romania and bow before the victims . 
  * '' ^ 1 - on december 21 , 2001 , 11 kids were trampled to death at a night club . 
  i talked with a former bouncer at the club recently and he told me the new bouncers ( he was n't working that night ) could n't manage the crowd and the kids in front were literally crushed .

  `` because we give a fuck '' is a slogan of \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0441 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043d . 
  20 is their number for sofia . 
  number 10 in their list is nikolay ivanov dobrev . 
  look at his shirt . 
   presumably most people are n't going to fly from europe to the us , never to return . 
  as an eastern-european , i can only say `` ha , watch me ! '', 
  this is the cheapest you can get in eu . 
  guys , our prime minister boyko borissov , who is serving his second mandate once told national tv that he does n't speak languages . 
  he only wants to hear `` congratulations '' / kongrachuleishans and he knows he did good work ( since a lot of comissars are coming here when he opens a new sector of a highway or a kindergarden or a factory or whatever with eu funds ) . 
  and i ca n't find the video , but vladimir putin went in the celebration room after the russian grand prix race ( it 's a special room where drivers prepare for the ceremony and have a second to themselves ) and asked the drivers ( hamilton , rosberg and bottas ? ), 
  ( i honestly forgot the proper words he said ) as in `` how fast are the cars actually/are the cars really fast '' . 
  in russian . 
  to the f1 drivers . 
  what ? 
  you okay , man ? 
  i 'm not saying to welcome them with folklore dancers , bread and butter and congratulatory citizenship with a flat in lyulin and bulgarrenault in the garage . 
  i 'm saying that it 's not just lack of funding or jobs or social benefits . 
  it 's also the lack of trust from the locals . 
  that 's why they are going to a place where people say `` welcome '' , not a place that says `` umri , mangal '' . 
  and how about `` because bulgarians do n't want them '' ? 
  here are two bright examples : first day of school , 2014 . 
  a municipality declines to accept 12 children refugees because the local parents `` do n't want their kids to study with gypsies '' . 
  funny thing is that a school here receives money/grant for every student registered and they still did n't want them . 
  a syrian family loaned properly a house in a nice peaceful village in south central bulgaria and then they got thrown out by the locals with screams `` talibans '' and `` mangals '' ( mangal is an offensive way to call the gypsies in bulgaria ) . 
  this guy is a joke . 
  he was fired in 2013 when the first wave hit us and we were totally unprepared for refugees and then suddenly they reinstated him back in jan 2015 without any competition at all . 
  edit : some clarification . 
  nope . 
  we have an election on sunday for president . 
  the first tour was led by a communist/fighter pilot followed by a communistic party secretary followed by a spy working against the bulgarian integrity followed by an oligarch who hands out cheap medicine and gas . 
  so no . 
  i am not glad i live in bulgaria and i 'm not glad that trump will go against russia because that will directly affect our pro-european policy in a pro-russian community . 
  i know it sounds schizophrenic . 
  it is . 
  this is photoshop . 
  you do n't have cat . 
  you do n't have even a potato . 
  soon you 'll die of malnourishment . 
  lucky you . 
  well it 's sunny and warm ... people do n't go to work that much ( check every stat about workforce and unemployment ) but they have to eat something so they tend to steal and not really abide the law . 
  so you must have police force to neutralize this . 
  whether in northern europe the criminals are cold and are just staying home . 
  wizzair flies from sofia to dubai .
