because slavic brothers !! 1 !, 
  slavic bullshit you mean ... stop with this delusional pan-slavism ... 
   i would honestly say that bulgaria shares a lot of similarities with all of its neighbors . 
  bulgaria shares a lot of bullshit with all of its neighbours . 
  we need the self-esteem boost , 
  every language is a macedonian dialect !, 
   in sofia i specially enjoyed a restaurant chain called something like `` bar & grill '' which we do n't have in spain . 
  as food there was like half the price we had in spain i remember eating mountains of food , ordering 2 desserts , etc. . . technically that is not bulgarian since i think it was american food but still , it was in sofia so it counts , does n't it ? 
  it 's called `` happy '' technically they have bulgarian cuisine but most of it is international cuisine . 
   btw , why do you add cucumber to everything ? 
  tarator soup was delicious . 
  it is like bulgarian gazpacho right ? 
  i miss that too . 
  i 'd like to make it at home but i do n't know the recipe . 
  cucumber to slavs is like potato to ireland or latvia , 
  ~ ~ btw do we have to do a secret cult handshake or something , when we meet on reddit :p ~ ~, 
  pls !, 
  yogurt stronk , makes you live 100 years !, 
  really , because i thought that the croats liked us and the serbs hated us ... and pls , every balkan country has gypsies , 
  yes great turnov is an amazing city , i love it as well !, 
  also very close to croatian , and we did steal folk music from yugoslavia . 
  indeed , although i wish we could brag less about the quality though , when i was in prague i loved the beer , and i am not even a beer person , i dislike beer , but czech beer , oh man ... 
  their stupidity , their redneck-iness , their dashcam videos , their amature porn . 
  i ca n't believe this , it must not be legit , we are a shit country . 
   the locals , however , basically called me idiot for coming here , told that they are savages , not worth visiting and that i should have certainly went somewhere else as basically anything is better than bulgaria they are right , we are a shit country and you should get out as soon as possible , before you get mugged or worse . 
  what ?!? 
  fancy meeting you here !, 
  hungar and bulgar stronk tribal steppe horsemen !!, 
  you like us ? 
  huh , honestly i 've always thought that we had a mutual hate going on ... 
  bulgaria : dragons forest fairies forest spirits giants, 
  nobody wants to come to bulgaria . 
  good . 
  russians are paranoid lunatics , why am i not surprised ... 
  cthulu , who will represent the elder ones ? 
  about ? 
  buddy , i am half-swede , i am well aware of the stereotypes ... 
  i am just trolling that person , it 's painfully obvious , also i am a half-swede myself , i was just trying to butthurt him/her with well known tired stereotypes : , 
  well not the social justice on tumblr , that one i am against , otherwise i am okay with the definition in this context . 
  i know what the index represents . 
  the thing is that `` social justice '' means a totally different thing on the internet , especially here on reddit and on tumblr , and my original post was ironic . 
  i think no such thing , i simply despise sjws . 
  yep , it sure is  edit : that coming from a swede is a compliment . 
  a country rampaging with political correctness and radical feminism ... i am actually glad we do n't have that here , and we are free to express what we think with the words we find most suitable . 
  beats me . 
  bulgar stronk !!!, 
  no it is not . 
  thank god bulgaria is not a sjw country !, 
  bulgaria . 
  sorry man , i guess i got butthurt . 
  wat i am half-swede-half-bulgarian and you are an arrogant asshole . 
  ** bulgaria ** * nothing . 
  i guess the hate between romanians and bulgarians is mutual then ... 
  eu brought nothing to our country . 
  who gives a shit ... 
  yeah , i know that , but why is the dutch embassy involved ? 
  what 's this about ? 
  i am just trying to explain why nothing is happening , 
  nothing ever happens in bulgaria dude , trust me on that . 
  this place is shit . 
  ** bulgaria ** * nothing . 
  what the hell are you talking about ? 
  i am glad we are not mentioned a lot , because when we are it 's usually by condescending western europeans and it 's always a bad thing !, 
  fuck you west europe , f u !, 
  ** bulgaria ** * absolutely ** nothing **, 
  i call bullshit on that sir !, 
  ** bulgaria ** * nothing still . 
  fuck you too . 
   in the eu 's poorest member state . 
  you . 
  well there are many gypsies here and many who hate them , sadly i am not surprised that things like that could happen . 
  ** bulgaria ** * nothing on the horizon . 
  i am so glad that we do n't speak that heathen language . 
  fuck english , and fuck the english . 
  ** bulgaria ** * nothing . 
  you call that something ? 
  political petty bickering and nothing else , that is nothing . 
  besides , you 're french , you do n't live here , what do you know ? 
  ** bulgaria ** * nothing happens in bulgaria , ever !, 
  have n't you guys learnt anything by now ? 
  ** bulgaria ** * still nothing . 
  ah a fellow neighbor with the same issues as mine ... 
  we get a lot of young people , brits , russians , germans and some scandinavians , and they mostly come here to drink and party . 
  that is rich coming from someone who does not work for less than 300 eu per month . 
  what would change ? 
  to quote south park , the choice is always between a douche and a turd ... 
  people are just tired , and more or less nihilistic . 
  they see no hope , they just want to get by . 
  reality , the politicians , mostly that , and i guess i am just apolitical . 
  bulgaria is the poorest eu member with rampaging crime and corruption , lots of riffraff . 
  nothing has changed in years , it only gets worse . 
  i do n't feel anything at all , only apathy , i am not voting on sunday , and so is the majority of bulgaria , i can guarantee that . 
  i feel nothing like that whatsoever . 
  ** bulgaria ** * still nothing . 
  flair up , and yes , you are right !, 
  do n't use heathen languages !, 
  shut up backstabber !, 
  ** bulgaria ** * nothing . 
  that we are poor rednecks , homophobes , genocidal maniacs and religious zealots . 
  fuck you western bastards !,
