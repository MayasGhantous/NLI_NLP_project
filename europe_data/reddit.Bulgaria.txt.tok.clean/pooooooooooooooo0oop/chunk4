  yes , debt relief usually means debt forgiveness . 
  nobody can stop greece from defaulting and paying whatever whenever they want . 
  apparently they do want another bailout . 
  when you ask for credit you are n't the one to set terms , you accept or do n't get credit . 
  what ?!, 
  you got 150 + billion for the program that expired ( the second package ) . 
  the negotiations to extend it failed , but it was running for years . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/assistance_eu_ms/greek_loan_facility/index_en.htm the mechanism of evaluation - payment seems good , but the initial tranche is usually the biggest and it is kind of an advance . 
  especially in the current situation it will precede any reforms , because it is imperative to open the banks and restart the economy . 
  they wo n't get * all * the money . 
  i 'm talking about giving out a loan . 
  i find it different from assuming greece 's debt commitments . 
  where should i look for such law ? 
  i ca n't believe a sovereign country ca n't decide who to give its money on its own . 
  if the ez ca n't vote on loans , germany and france can do it on their own as countries . 
  oh , i agree . 
  my argument was that the greek should be thankful they got a break , regardless of the creditor 's motivation . 
  it is . 
  sounds like a good indicator for government efficiency . 
  thanks !, 
  although i doubt it accounts tax evasion when estimating revenue . 
  i 'm really skeptical about them raising taxes again . 
  taxes are already high , it will only kill whoever ca n't switch to cash payments and the rest do n't declare income anyway . 
  okay , enlighten me about the disparities of both datasets . 
  why is there a crisis if they have 5 % surplus while their payments are 4 % ? 
  in real numbers , greece had a primary budget surplus of 1.9 bn euro for 2014 . 
  in real numbers that is ** nearly 1 % ** . 
  i 've read the definition for cyclical adjustment and it only reinforced my opinion that the imf graph is crap . 
  ** 5 % ** with whatever methodology is incorrect . 
  i 'm saying data relying on gdp estimates for an economy in free-fall is useless . 
  if they had a surplus above 5 % of gdp there would n't be a crisis , as [ their debt payments are bellow that ] ( http://knoema.com/oecdeo97jun/oecd-economic-outlook-no-97-june-2015?accesskey=usjdfue ) . 
  when data and reality disagree i choose to believe reality . 
  both graphs ca n't be taken at face value . 
  your graph reads `` of ** potential ** gdp '' . 
  the oecd data for 2015 ( and 2014 even ) also has to be with gdp projection . 
  the reasons do n't matter . 
  fact is they provided greece more time to sort its mess out . 
  who the hell hates on germany ?!, 
  i mean hate is a strong word for this situation . 
  `` i hate you for not giving me yet another 50 year loan to refinance my bugatti , that it just occurred to me , i ca n't pay off with a mcdonalds job '' ??? 
  whatever happens , there can be only gratitude for getting them this far . 
  nobody was obligated to help and talk for years . 
  poland , you 're drunk . 
   the luxury of being about increase their debt burden five-fold and still be able to borrow from the markets at low rates while greece could n't do that on the market , the ez stepped in and provided them 240bn euro . 
  so access to financing is n't the difference , it 's the execution . 
  my country is the poorest in the union and is quite small . 
  the eu economically is good because : 1 . 
  we are a net recipient from the eu budget . 
  read : germany is paying for building our highways . 
  there is a free movement of workers . 
  that means 700k bulgarians work and live in another eu country instead of sitting here on benefits . 
  those people send annually more money back in the country than the total sum of direct foreign investments . 
  we are a very corrupt country . 
  the eu funds are under eu supervision . 
  they are also used to pressure our government into passing some ( judicial ) reforms . 
  free trade . 
  more than 60 % of our trade is with the eu . 
  that means cheaper imports and competitive exports . 
  free movement of capitals and goods . 
  eu companies have easier time creating jobs for our cheap labor force . 
  we have access to all the universities in europe according to the country 's laws . 
  that made it much cheaper than being a foreigner . 
  they did n't force them !, 
  they gave them a choice when there was only the default . 
  and greece alone put itself in the difficult position to choose . 
  nobody forced it on them . 
  it is simply outrageous to put blame on the creditors who offered loans when nobody else was willing . 
  not russia , not china , not the usa - nobody . 
  there must be a reason for that , eh ? 
  ecb is giving loans to banks by common rules . 
  i do n't see why greece has to be an exception again . 
  i 'm not hating on greece . 
  i 'm a firm believer in the free market and these bailouts are a massive distortion of the market . 
  there are supposed to be consequences for both sides on a bad credit . 
  they have been given time ( 5 years ) and money (  240bn ) . 
  they 've been shown way more courtesy than cyprus or anybody else . 
  you can see here the ridiculously long terms and low interest rates they 've been given . 
  waaaaaay below the market ( when it existed ) . 
  this year was the last to be restructured and tsipras simply destroyed them at the finish line . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  greece borrowed to death . 
  then nobody on earth would lend them a penny more when the troika gave them more than 240bn in 5 years . 
  i am sickened that they are considering giving them even more money . 
  the greek government is like a junkie and their drug is money . 
  no , if you borrow way more than you can afford , you are at the mercy of your creditor . 
  happens to millions of people , no illuminati involved . 
  somersby and carling are all over our tv this year . 
  it seems they are on an eastern offensive . 
  oh , yes , the quotas are some commie bullshit . 
  and fair subsidies across the countries are so impossible that i 'd rather they remove them and lower taxes or introduce a food stamp scheme instead . 
  it 's so sweet how you have some faith in the justice system . 
  i wish we had a justice system . 
  you know , you are probably right about the law . 
  if you warn them you are n't paying cash they wo n't give you a receipt beforehand . 
  cash registers at supermarkets also print after you close them . 
  but at clubs and restaurants , if you are paying cash , they will give you a receipt and return after a couple of minutes for the money . 
  yeah , it also does n't have boats to move between the islands it does n't have . 
  it 's just math , dude . 
  even at 4 am at the club i get a receipt , read the sum and hand the money . 
  saves a lot of shouting over the bar .
