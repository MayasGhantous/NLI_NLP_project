  i would n't be surprised if the actual brexit does n't happen when push comes to shove . 
   `` the lads defended the honour of their country , '' russian media quoted mp igor lebedev , who is also on the executive committee of the football union . 
   the spokesman for russia 's powerful investigative committee went even further . 
   `` a normal man , as he should be , surprises them , '' tweeted vladimir markin , referring to european outrage at russian hooligans . 
  `` they 're used to seeing ` men ' at gay parades , '' he concluded . 
  nice , now we also have state sponsored hooliganism . 
  wow . 
  whoever thought that is a good idea !? 
  public housing is supposed to be a safety net for the poor , but from the article i gather that ordinary swedes can apply ? 
  hah , someone thought the tsa fondling you was n't invasive enough . 
  funny people those americans . 
  being indifferent and hating are not the same . 
  what do you dislike about poland that makes you anti-eu ? 
  how will it help germany if the eu dissolves ( you 'll save money and lose markets , it seems to even out , but actually you 'll lose exporting jobs and maybe gain some low qualified services jobs ) ? 
  i can confirm , our teachers earn nothing . 
  how come this building does n't have an underground level ? 
  do they just drop it in its new place , is n't the structure supposed to have at least some pillars dug into the ground ? 
  ummm ... sorry for asking , but why are there so many moroccans in ( western ) europe ? 
  are they getting working visas for unskilled jobs ?!, 
  are you just never deporting people ? 
  we have exactly the same trains :(, 
  italy has a larger economy than russia, 
  this map must be completely wrong . 
  ours should be telerik or imperia online , depending how you define `` internet company '' . 
  use latex gloves , detergent is not good for the skin and you are overdosing . 
  arrested , not murdered !, 
  progress !, 
  i ca n't agree with you on this one . 
  i see it more as a whistle-blowing on a national security threat that nobody does anything about and the step to a smearing campaign is quite large . 
  i will reiterate that this case is from december and the people in question did conflicting interviews . 
  being an old news and given that party 's usual voters , this will have zero effect on our election and whoever leaked it knows it very well . 
  it is for foreign consumption . 
  actually this is a story from 4 months ago and in the course of several conflicting public statements it became clear there is truth to it . 
  it is not just a smear campaign against our beloved former communist party . 
  and that is exactly the issue in bulgaria - we have a rebranded communist party ( ran the regime '44 - ' 89 ) that still keeps in line with russia , not a normal socialist party that just pursues left policies . 
  and when the russian spy goes in another country to push the agenda of a pro-russian party we have a reason to be concerned . 
  especially when the russian interests are at odds with our national interests , for example weak vs strong eu . 
  is this working https://t.co/fhrfaie2td, 
  this new party was created by the former chairman of an older turkish party [ dps ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/movement_for_rights_and_freedoms ) . 
  he was removed quite dramatically and at the time he even took temporary shelter in the turkish embassy because he feared for his life . 
  so as far as the turkish minority focus goes , they can be like denk , but knowing our history with dps , you probably never did or will have anything similar in the netherlands . 
  they are the [ epitome of corruption ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/151481/fbi+scandal+-+bulgaria%27s+ethnic+turks+long-time+leader+%27revenge%27 ) in bulgaria ( and do n't give a fuck , because will always have the turkish vote ) . 
  dost is a new party aimed at the turkish minority and endorsed by erdogan . 
  people were banned for being a threat to national security - creating anti-bulgarian attitudes in the regions with mixed population . 
  i 'm not following this incident and do n't know if they spoke at a party rally . 
  we have a general election on sunday . 
  are the amish any good at pickpocketing ? 
  oh , the hsbc again . 
  and to think we were so fixated on off-shore banking secrecy . 
  who are you so afraid of, 
  great beaches , food and riots . 
  maybe the question is understood differently . 
  as in `` divine entity '' , `` fate '' , `` karma '' , `` meaning of life '' . 
  or people there do n't differentiate between keeping traditions and being religious . 
  and you think you own us because you funded a highway ? 
  lol everybody in the east said the problem is economic illegal migrants , while you kept calling them refugees ... until the wave reached you . 
  come to bulgaria , corp tax is only 10 % and there is a very little chance of someone stealing [ your company ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fm.btvnovinite.bg%2farticle%2fkriminalno%2fizmamnik-otkradna-desetki-firmi-s-e-podpis.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) , its [ bank account ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2flegalworld.bg%2f35395.eto-kak-otkradnaha-10-mln-lv-ot-ubitiia-mandjukov.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) or [ the whole bank ] ( http://www.novinite.com/articles/165627/2014%3a+the+attack+on+bulgaria%27s+corpbank+leaves+everyone+a+loser ) , 
  what the fuck , state railways can have profits ?!, 
  we 've been subsidizing ours since forever . 
  there may be questionable practices by one ally that merit negotiations , but if it really is a nato base , open for use by all nato members , i 'd rather keep it . 
  as eu members are also nato members , the base is part of eu 's military capabilities and think we 're gon na need those in the future . 
  but why would we remove nato bases ? 
  i do n't think eu military needs downsizing especially now . 
   against turkey because they look darker than us this is quite stupid . 
  i 'm not sure how much are they us bases and not nato bases . 
  ramstein is called a us base , but houses all sorts of units . 
  it is the same as yours - you choose a party and a favored candidate . 
  it is unnecessarily huge . 
  last time we had 25 parties and here is our [ ballot ] ( http://pia-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/buletina.jpg ) . 
  you mark the party on the left and then on the right you can mark a preferred candidate . 
  the candidate names are not listed so the paper is only 1/4th of yours . 
  do n't you have exit polls , who 's winning ? 
  and what are we going to do with the 37 million people there who share erdogan 's mindset ? 
  no thanks . 
  ummm ... let me voice an unpopular opinion . 
  we are having an election in 2 weeks and as always people abroad will be able to vote and some politicians indeed do campaign there . 
  only they do it in [ conference rooms q&a style ] ( https://dabulgaria.bg/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hristo-ivanov-viena-960x480.jpg ) , not big open air demonstrations ( probably nobody would go ) . 
  there are * some * grounds for calling double standards , of course that does n't excuse the subsequent reaction . 
  i would like to laugh at turkey , but they are too fucking close !!, 
  `` by default '' my ass , you even contradict yourself in the next paragraph . 
  i 'm easily amused, 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=macaron&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj08kgto8nsahwhuhokhxryazcq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=810 ), 
  the pen bad , macaron good , that 's all i know about french politics \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) \\ _ / \u00af edit : and ham is gaining popularity , nice !, 
  but you are forgetting that they do n't need to fit a dozen of sensors and radios in this 3310 . 
  i do n't understand this logic . 
  so it could last 3 months , how is that not useful ?!, 
  it would also be something to improve on the feature phones from the last 10 years . 
  this 3310 is just a new plastic shell of something from 2006 . 
  i find that battery rather disappointing . 
  imagine if they put in the 3000mah that budget motorolas come with . 
  and any other chinese crap comes with at least 2200mah . 
  you monster, 
  we sure do :p, 
  sounds like some of our gypsy ghettos , so no big deal really . 
  it 's 23 % here .

  are you trying to tell me gypsies actually showed up in school to take the pisa test ? 
  true , i was being stupid . 
   in 1913 39 % of the population was jewish , in 2000 it was 0.3 % . 
  that 's for the city thessaloniki .
