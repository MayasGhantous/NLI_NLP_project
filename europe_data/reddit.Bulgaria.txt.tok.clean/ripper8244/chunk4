  we can easely say that britain is the unstable one while europe is like canada , there are not that many unstable policies here , believe it or not . 
  it 's your future that is uncertain at the moment . 
   north america is in a much better state . 
  higher standards of living , higher wages e.t.c. 
  higher cost of life , buying apartments costing half a million . 
  staying in debt for the rest of your life if you have an heath emergency or want good education . 
  you are an idiot . 
  he could have used it in more inportant places and earlier when his power grip was weak . 
  why now ? 
  he profits zero from this . 
  is it confirmed that the plane the plane dropped the serine gas ? 
  i am not doubting the atack but who had the serin in the first place . 
  how is it confirmed ? 
  why would someone winning the war use chemical weapons , which are bound to cause an autrage , just now . 
  not to mention the location is not even strategic . 
  not saying he did not do it but i ca n't see the line of thinking here . 
  yep , can confirm . 
  even turkey is closer to britain than iraq culturally . 
  by the way , we are arguing in 2 different topics together :d, 
  really ? 
  i 'd never assume someone from germany would be calling poland culturally backward . 
  because they are there for centuries , well integrated and do n't cause any problems . 
  that 's why i get pissed when people try telling ee is semi nazi or something . 
  we have close to 600 000 muslims , which account for a big portion of the population ( bigger than france i think ) . 
  mostly no problems , just one place which is , you have guessed it , saudi arabia funded . 
  to be fair , i never got how we are culturally closer to iraq for him . 
  i do n't think he ment it in the religious way . 
  probably that we are too conservative or something . 
  you never know with those kind of people and their senceless rhetoric . 
  but i guess you are right , no american would ever comment on ee matters . 
  they tend to not be informed about that region that much . 
  so brit confirmed . 
  found the ignorant brit/american ( guessing the first ) who has never been in iraq and eastern europe . 
  england left eu less than a week ago and fucking this happens . 
  everything is german and french , parrots . 
   ` can you say it in a sensible language ' i thought it 's `` can you say it in an understandable language '' . 
  german is hard :(, 
  i am group 1 since it 's the easiest, 
  i will be fair here and would like to emphisise on the fact that ** some ** of them do it . 
  it 's not entirely black and white . 
  specially for turkey , people notice it just now because the people in power made the bigots feel entitled . 
  sadly , it is just making a huge devide at the moment between eu and turkey . 
  the bad turks do n't hide it and the good are an exception . 
  here ** mangals ** are not allowed ( ** roma ** , ** gypsies ** etc. 
  garbage ) way to use all 3 words towards 1 group . 
  and of course he did n't even write it correctly . 
  \u041f\u0420\u041e\u0427\u0415\u0415 means moreover , what he wanted to say is \u041f\u0420\u041e\u0427\u0418\u0415 - etc. 
  but whatever . 
  wow , this does sound like zimbabwe 2.0 . 
  and last time they were burning books , now it 's entire schools ? 
  guess it is getting worse . 
  and , go figure , [ guy looks like a far cry dictator ] ( http://afrika54news.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/julius-malema.jpg ) . 
  i know this is not the place , but could you give me some insights on what 's happening there . 
  last i heard economy was going down and there were racial tensions . 
   she said talking super pleasant things about her city ( what is ok ) but the same time she talked that poland is hopeless . 
  i think they are taught from early age that turkey is the best and everyone is trying to pull it back . 
  i read a lot of similar comments about bulgaria from turks . 
  it 's kind of funny how some of them are living in an alternate reality . 
  do n't let it get to you , they are distancing themselves rather than other people . 
  i would like to visit your county one day if it makes you feel better :3, 
  i have a hard time believing they know what communism is . 
  and that flag looking thing better be not what i think it is . 
  i do not wish us being assotiated with these folks, 
   they liken it to isis rule in iraq and syria . 
  which it was nothing like . 
  no where did i say that . 
  we would n't be here if that was the case . 
  i read a lot of opinions that the empire was really tollerant and minorities had their own courts even !, 
  altho true , it does not indicate the whole truth and shadows what it actually was . 
  empires exist with brutal actions , ottoman empire is no different . 
   did they disenfranchise them and treat them as lesser people ? 
  absolutely ? 
  but slaves ? 
  hardly . 
  guess our diffinitions vary . 
  leaving it here . 
   the demonization of turks and ottomans by these people borders on outright racism we have a huge turkish minority , probably the biggest in the balkans even to this day . 
  they have a party representing them , news in turkish on the national tv and equal rights as any other citizen in bulgaria . 
  things may not be perfect but are far from bad . 
  no sane person is demonizing them . 
   but why do europeans discuss it with them then . 
  bulgaria has an legit reason to do it , no matter if you think it 's overexagerated or not . 
  if someone brings communism and how good it was , how we should be teaming with russia instead of the `` faggot loving west '' - then i will react the same way as this case . 
  it 's part of our history and it 's a concerning matter for me . 
  so i discuss that . 
   are you not opposed to double standards and hypocrisy ? 
  i am , as much as i know germans apolgized and are almost hating them selves generations after the genocide they did . 
  do n't think they are a good example for that . 
  if that 's not enough i do not know what it is . 
  do n't know about the others though . 
  russia never admited about killing it 's own people in the war , let alone someone else 's . 
  so there 's that . 
  do n't know the stance on spaniards , english , french and austrians . 
   none of these country acknowledge these crimes nor do they apologize . 
  do n't know about apologizing but it is well documented and covered in the big history books . 
  that 's on university level though , almost nothing about casualties in high school books - just the war , the pacts and the territorial gains/losses if i am not mistaking . 
  i remember reading about it and it was not watered down . 
  it stated that every nation wes on killing sprees without following any laws when it came to invasion . 
   if the police stopped the nationalists then i commend them and the government . 
  it was basially protests  escalation  stopped busses ( at that point police were called i think )  some people trying to cross by foot and trough the protests  confrontation between people protesting and people trying to cross the border  protestants harrasing people  police intervention and normal crossing of border .
