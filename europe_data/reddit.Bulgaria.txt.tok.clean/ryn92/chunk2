  which part is wrong ? 
  if i 'm wrong about something , i 'd like to know . 
  i 'm simply pointing out things that i 've discovered on my own in my free time out of curiosity . 
  people these days assume other people simply have an agenda i guess . 
  either way , if my knowledge about an event is not factually correct , i 'd like to know . 
  thanks in advance in case you decide to spend a minute or two to post a link ;p, 
  i said * just as * disgusting , not worse . 
  how is deliberately starting ww2 instead of simply agreeing to germany getting back the territories granted to poland at the end of ww2 not disgusting ? 
  the whole thing started like [ this ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=danzig+massacres&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ff88vywjao2vatsigdai&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0cayq_auoaq# ) : here 's more detailed info : http://www.wintersonnenwende.com/scriptorium/english/archives/articles/wrsynopsis.html the uk for example started bombing civilians first . 
  or what about the us throwing 2 nuclear bombs over japan ? 
  or the bombing of [ dresden ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=firebombing+of+dresden&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=gf88vbxzhsjrap7ggnab&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965#imgrc=iyh_ezwogzl4rm%253a%3bkzjhg_vp0nfunm%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.wordsmiththebook.com%252fwp-content%252fuploads%252f2015%252f01%252fbombing-of-dresden.gif%3bhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.wordsmiththebook.com%252fannihilation-dresden-bombing-raid%252f%3b500%3b298 ) by the uk ? 
  or the bombing of [ berlin ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=firebombing+of+dresden&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=gf88vbxzhsjrap7ggnab&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965#tbm=isch&amp;q=bombing+of+berlin ) when the war pretty much over ? 
  or what about the bombing of my country 's capital that was not a threat at all and was forced into collaborating with the germans but never participated in any major battle and was begging for peace ? 
  bombing of [ sofia ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=firebombing+of+dresden&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=gf88vbxzhsjrap7ggnab&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965#tbm=isch&amp;q=bombing+of+sofia ) again , i 'm not by any means saying the nazis are innocent . 
  i 'm saying the allies were just as bad . 
  i 'm not even getting into the fact that the west basically handed eastern europe and the baltics on a plate to stalin . 
  simply collaborating with that disgusting monster is enough for me to label the uk/us just as bad as the nazis . 
  if you want to further propagate post-ww2 historical propaganda - be my guest . 
  but neither were the nazis barbarians * until the war started * , neither was the west innocent of the utterly devastating consequences of that war . 
  edit : fixed ultra long link, 
  that is actually not true . 
  hitler thought every race/ethnicity should stick to their own country and he was actually quite respectful to people of color , unlike the british pm for example or roosevelt . 
  in the 30s jews were allowed to move to palestine with all their capital . 
  jewish generals served in the wehrmacht . 
  there was a cossack division led by a german general . 
  there was a muslim ss divison . 
  i 'm in no way trying to be apologetic - they nazis committed horrible crimes but today , 70 years later , we still do n't talk about the atrocities committed by the allies . 
  sadly , the uk and the us were just as disgusting as the nazis and for certain countries , quite worse . 
  that article pretty much sums up the reason why ww2 started in the first place despite hitler literally begging the british not to interfere in the way he 's handling the situation with poland which was committing a genocide against the ethnic german population at the time . 
  imagine what a world we 'd live in if countries stopped giving welfare to nationals of other countries . 
  what would a romanian ( or bulgarian for that matter ) do in freakin ' sweden if they do n't speak english or swedish ? 
  wake me up when the madness ends . 
  thanks . 
  occulus video streaming in a year or two ? 
  all the questions [ here ] ( http://www.oecd.org/pisa/test/ ) were kidergarden stuff . 
  dunno if things have changed but when i was in 9th grade i could take the british gsces in maths no problems . 
  we study quadratics in 7th to 8th grade here and trig in 9th . 
  i 'd rather think that people did n't care enough and simply scratched random answers to leave the classroom asap . 
  i used to do that with iq tests =d, 
  o_o really ? 
  my first thought while i was scrolling down and the pic appeared in my peripheral was a cut in half girl and tons of blood . 
  rorschach would be proud of me =d i like the blue bear with the bag the most =d edit ; i just realised that 's the kremlin and you 're talking about a different picture . 
  i 'm going to bed now , good night everyone - . -, 
  just a wild guess - some associate roma people with india ( presumably moved here by the ottomans ) . 
  that may have something to do with your observation . 
  i 've no idea how that myth started ( or if it 's a myth even ) but yeah , there you go . 
  lol . 
  rape per 100k sweden - 63.5 rape per 100k uk - 28 legit . 
  i know 2 guys in the uk - one works at a bank , the other one has a degree in physics but unfortunately i do n't know what exactly his job is . 
  i have a [ cae ] ( http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams/advanced/ ) as do both of them . 
  now tell me - do you think it 's possible that , you know , your country is actually flooded with eastern europeans but you do n't notice them because they 're so well integrated ? 
  according to our statistics institute , there are up to 100k bulgarians in the uk and probably 3-5x that amount in germany . 
  as a matter of fact , bulgarians are the second largest group of immigrant university students in germany from what i 've read on the web . 
  i ca n't hear germans complaining about it , can you ? 
  mr. farage should be complaining about the islamic courts and the stupid protectionism of mohammedanians instead of us imo . 
  recently i read about a mother sentences to prison for insulting islam . 
  what o0 ??? 
  do you even know where bulgaria and afghanistan are on the map ? 
  even if our border control did let them pass ( which i doubt -- our border guards tend to be dicks and threaten the syrians trying to get across , let alone pakistanis ) , there are like 5 other countries that they need to go through and on top of that bulgaria , romania and slovenia are not in schengen . 
  if you get illegals coming from the balkans , it 's not * only * our fault . 
  greece is starting to look like bulgaria lmao :d, 
  well , my best friend is a really cool guy but he 's one of these people who never had much interest in following social expectations . 
  his let 's call it a dream is building a house somewhere in the forest , growing his own stuff and living in peace . 
  i kind of want the same except i 'm into vfx / cgi so spending a few hundred $ $ to buy construction materials , building our own houses ( can ask engineering people on the internet for help i guess ? 
  ) , connecting to the internets and trying to do work there would be great . 
  i do n't buy too much into the idea of a libertarian country unfortunately . 
  i would n't mind giving away part of what i earn so that we can have roads , hospitals and schools . 
  now imagine if we could get educated redditors there - engineers , medical personnel , construction workers , lawyers , accountants , teachers and so on . 
  you 'd only need a few hundred people willing to make this their home . 
  sadly , i did n't see any of that . 
  people were just arguing over the official language and gay marriage ffs . 
  if that brings misunderstanding i do n't even want to imagine what a nightmare the logistics and the public spending decisions would be . 
  i was thinking of signing up - it 's right next to me after all and it 's a good chance to participate ( really participate ! ), 
  in the development of the country . 
  then i went through their forums and saw an absurd amount of croats and serbs fighting over what the official language should be when the obvious choice is english . 
  anyway , that 's not what discouraged me but the fact that these people had an agenda - sadly , it felt like their desires were driven by subtle nationalism . 
  same with the gay marriage topic - it felt like half the users were your typical balkan ' i am not a homophobe but ... ' . 
  if it was reddit doing that i would not think twice about it . 
  something 's telling me that these people will turn out to be assholes tho and i do n't think it ever happened that i thought someone 's an asshole and i was wrong . 
  will definitely be following the development of their country . 
  maybe they 'll give up and r/europe will claim the clay lol who knows, 
  vat across the eu is pretty similar from what i 've seen . 
  goes in the 18-24 % if i 'm not mistaken . 
  shaving off or adding a percent or two for each individual country wo n't really hurt the people that much i think ; o i 'm not an economist however so take that with a grain of salt ;p, 
   social scientists and government officials say there is no single cause for the phenomenon . 
  certainly the recent financial crisis and persistently high youth unemployment have played critical roles , as they have in other nations . 
  ehm no ? 
  i 'd simply rather not waste money on rent and help out my parents financially ? 
  not having a girlfriend/boyfriend means having 0 incentive to move out . 
  and half my friends my age are not in a relationship and/or never had a serious one , just one-night flings at a party . 
  i 'm not a euroskeptic - i 'd rather work to achieve something and hopefully have a say in how the future unfolds but i certainly agree with you here - money is being * wasted * . 
  i 'd go as far as saying the * majority * of the money is being wasted , at least based on my experience with bulgaria . 
  [ 800 000 euros for this logo ] ( http://devel.forumnews.bg/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8-%d0%b1%d1%80%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b4-%d0%bb%d0%be%d0%b3%d0%be-%d1%82%d1%83%d1%80%d0%b8%d0%b7%d1%8a%d0%bc.jpg ) sadly , the eu is n't much different . 
  wasted money on meaningless projects . 
  i 'd make them a better logo for free ffs . 
  a military occupation would be my choice . 
  not trying to fix their countries but literally occupying them until at least 2/3 of the population is literate and those countries can sustain themselves . 
  a marshall plan for africa if you will . 
  i really hope someone out there has the guts to do something that ` wrong ' . 
  i do n't understand why the us , eu , china and russia are not working on something along those lines * together * .
