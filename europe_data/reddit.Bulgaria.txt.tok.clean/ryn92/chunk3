  the issues with africa and the middle east are a threat to the entire world , not just the eu and the us . 
  well , it 's an insult and when insulting someone , you do n't need to be factually accurate . 
  [ allusion ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/allusion ), 
  i would n't mind living in bulgayria . 
  sadly , that 's not the case - . -, 
  i hereby proclaim you a balkan country . 
  there , now you 're balkan . 
  fuck you turkey !, 
  children were massacred too . 
  i associate family and icecream with children so my guess would be he 's making fun of the fact bulgarian kids were murdered there . 
  idd i do follow rt 's youtube channel . 
  western medias tend to serve the status quo . 
  wish i knew japanese or chinese tho, 
  no , it would n't . 
  i watched a video on facebook a few months ago - a highschool student took the recycle bin in the classroom and put it on the teacher 's head . 
  she got quite angry but he was just laughing at her and so was the rest of his class . 
  if you dig on vkontakte ( their facebook ) i 'm sure you 'll find hundreds of those , as well as plenty of other disgusting things . 
  i know for a fact i can present bulgaria as the most backwards , disgusting , racist , homophobic whorehouse in the world if i wanted to . 
  well , if there are enough people in europe who are deluded enough to think russia is all roses and putin is the personification of justice itself , let them see what russia really is - a shithole , a tad worse than the shitholes on the balkans . 
  that 's all russia is , really . 
  but they see moscow and saint petersberg instead . 
  and the russian society - oh , do n't get me started . 
  i regret learning russian because out of curiosity , i always end up watching some of their talk shows and reading some of their newspapers and dear god is the amount of stupid mindblowing . 
  all i 'm saying is let everyone see it . 
  you do n't need to lie at all . 
  i mean , my imagination is not good enough to produce a dystopia as ugly as what russia is today so all that we need to do is present it to our societies for what it is . 
  do it long enough and the argument ` western zionist zombie propaganda ' will finally be destroyed by truth itself . 
   the job description notes they should be former journalists or press officers and know their way around `` social media '' . 
  great . 
  those are the ones spreading the myths here . 
  cause modern journalism is so hard you need a degree to do a job as simple as the one advertised . 
  i 'd understand if they were looking for actual writers who can engage the audience but journalists ... ? 
  dear eu , that 's why russia is so much better than you at spreading bullshit . 
  i can imagine the next move would be pouring millions into companies doing social media advertisement which will again be extremely inefficient and a complete waste of money . 
  how about we start throwing poop back at the russians instead of hiring people to throw facts at that part of the population who do n't care about facts ? 
  you 're reading it the other way around =d, 
  maybe it 's due to ignorance but this guy is one of my favorite historical figures along with abe lincoln, 
  hurr durr me wants soviet onion bek bratstvo narodov nadezdnij oplod, 
  i know it has already been mentioned by other people who 've answered your post but i want to stress it too - the russians do like to spread that kind of crap to divide society . 
  i can imagine the baltic countries leaning toward the nordics is n't really what they 'd like . 
  same shit happens here , in bulgaria , where people used to lean towards the us and the united kingdom . 
  over the years , all sort of bullshit started appearing in the media . 
  i signed that for the lols =d, 
  from the comments :  i have an acquaintance in the macedonian government press office called golem kur . 
  he says this is a very nice and interesting article golem kur means big cock . 
  :  lmao, 
  social pressure . 
  try to say something anti-gay and see how it works out for you . 
  i 'm gay btw . 
  but if i had to choose between not having the right to marry and adopt and the crazy swedes , i 'm fine the way i am , thanks but no thanks , sweden . 
  lol the soviets freaking started ww2 together with hitler what are you talking about . 
  such a shame the us did n't drop the a-bombs on them rather than japan . 
  there were even british-american plans to continue the war once germany capitulates - but this time against the commies . 
  i 'm very much anti-russia for being a backwards country only capable of bringing misery upon its people . 
  we have a saying here tho - no one can do to you what you can do to yourself . 
  being at war does n't justify this vandalism . 
  if you want the statues removed - do it like civilised people . 
  a bunch of hooligans destroying public property with the blessing of the state ... shame on you , ukraine . 
  and shame on those police officers . 
  [ over 1000 bulgarian villages face permanent depopulation ] ( https://translate.google.bg/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.slivenpress.bg%2fnovini-bulgaria-bylgariq%2f15-bulgaria-bylgariq%2f13322-%25d0%259d%25d0%2590%25d0%2594-1000-%25d0%25a1%25d0%2595%25d0%259b%25d0%2590-%25d0%2592-%25d0%2591%25d0%25aa%25d0%259b%25d0%2593%25d0%2590%25d0%25a0%25d0%2598%25d0%25af-%25d0%259e%25d0%259f%25d0%25a3%25d0%25a1%25d0%25a2%25d0%25af%25d0%2592%25d0%2590%25d0%25a2-%25d0%25a2%25d0%25a0%25d0%2590%25d0%2599%25d0%259d%25d0%259e&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) funny thing is that western europeans buy property in the rural areas ; o it 's pretty cheap i guess and if you 're a retired brit , you 'd live like a king . 
  if i had a few hundred thousand spare , i 'd buy out all the property in a ghost town somewhere relatively close to a major city or maybe the black sea coast , make the place all nice and cozy and liveable and start selling the property . 
  then open my own shop and restaurant and stuff :  ez money, 
  dunno if that 's the case in western europe but football fans here are the scum of society . 
  all they do is beat people , destroy public property and turn the streets into a war zone . 
  luckily for the rest of the world , i 'm not into politics but if i were , my life 's goal would be to commit a genocide against them  . , 
  in a perfect world , i think high school education should be mandatory * and * government funded until you hit 21 . 
  and also there should be a class and an exam in justice and political theory or something along those lines that you need to pass to get your degree . 
  i also think government positions should not be granted based only on a vote . 
  rather , i think civil service ( as in people running ngos and finding ways to help the society ) experience * and * at least a master 's + bachelor 's degrees in both a humanitarian * and * a scientific field ( or vice-versa ) should be required to be allowed to participate in an election for a minister . 
  so , obviously , i 'm against parliament appointed government . 
  i think voting should be separate . 
  reason ? 
  the world is changing extremely fast and it bothers me that not only here , in tiny and corrupt bulgaria , the people in charge are ignorant , but everywhere . 
  if 50 years ago a phd was a big deal , now it 's not anymore . 
  young people are absurdly smart and well informed and they 're coming up with all sort of wonderful plans and ideas that make society a better place . 
  the governments , however , are stuck in the past . 
  i find the notion that the government has the moral right to redistribute said wealth laughable . 
  especially on such grounds . 
  unless you 're willing to argue that responsibility is somehow hereditary . 
  to top it off - yes , i do find it unreasonable . 
  i think it 's cultural . 
  just the way it is in europe . 
  if you check the us census data you 'll see that bulgarian immigrants for example earn just about the same as the average american while northern europeans earn 10-30 % more * on average * . 
  i 'm not heartless and i do think social issues need to be addressed but not by guilt tripping people . 
  appealing to their humanity may turn out to be a better option . 
  are you sure it 's his hand that you want to hold , mr. prime minister : < ? 
  haha =d you almost got me . 
  the effects of slave trade !, 
  nice one :d !, 
  why :( whyyyy :( ( ( (, 
  this is precisely why i said i 'm pissed off at the eu for * cooperating * with these people . 
  it 's just wrong . 
  however , i ca n't expect the eu to fix our issues for us . 
  if the bulgarian people ca n't spare 30 minutes of their lives once every 4 years to look for someone to vote for , then they deserve what they 've been getting . 
  so far we 've voted into power russian-backed criminals and local criminals . 
  nothing else . 
  whether it be the ` socialists ' or borisov 's mafia , we 're talking about criminals . 
  and bulgarians vote for them . 
  blame the west all you want but a westerner would generally tend * not * to vote for the mafia . 
  haha , bulgaria was anti-russian and thus - anti-entente .
