  russia , gb and france were allies . 
  sure britain was against russian interests on the balkans - namely , constantinople , but so was everyone else . 
  at some point , however , they got desperate enough to agree to russia getting constantinople . 
  you see , bulgaria fucked up big time . 
  we backstabbbed serbia and it was absolutely justified - i wo n't argue that . 
  but by doing that , we secured the prolonging of the war and in my humble opinion - the fall of tsarism in russia and the communist revolution . 
  you see , had we done what was right instead of what we wanted , the ottoman empire would 've fallen and with it - austro-hungary - which by the way could n't even win against the serbs . 
  what we did was we secured the balkans for the central powers . 
  had we won then it would 've been huge for us but by the time we joined the war , russia and serbia had annihilated the austro-hungarian army ; great britain was bombarding instanbul ; germany was fighting on 2 fronts and what 's most important - romania and greece were still fresh . 
  to put it mildly it was bulgaria and germany against the rest of the world . 
  and we knew knew that . 
  and we fucked up big time . 
  again , it 's my personal opinion but if you 're looking for someone to blame for the communist atrocities in eastern europe - bulgaria is a good candidate . 
  our interference prolonged the war far too much and gave lenin the opportunity to take russia . 
  for once our actions could 've changed the world and we fucked up . 
  and we fucked up not just our country but half the planet . 
  and it 's all on us . 
  had we acted decently instead of greedy as our neighbours did a few years ago , the world could 've been a very different place . 
  but we had a moron in charge . 
  and today , we keep electing morons . 
  the eu has nothing to do with that . 
  i 'm genuinely pissed off at them for * working * with those morons that we elect but in the end of the day , it 's not them to blame . 
  it 's not moral of them if you ask me but ... that 's the way it is . 
  ehm ... what does the eu have to do with bulgaria joining the austro-turko-germany in a war they were clearly losing ;d ? 
  the allies were offering half of macedonia and the european part of turkey yet we went with germany out of greed . 
  there 's that . 
  things are bad , i agree . 
  but if you 're looking for someone to blame for the current situation - take a look at your parents . 
  or if you 're older than 30 - just look in the mirror , 
  can anyone summarize the benefits and drawbacks of membership for me  ? 
  nah , they 're extremely impudent . 
  [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/delyan_peevski ) for example is known to be the sonny boy of a woman that holds a small media empire that does social engineering for certain countries ( read russia ) . 
  he was appointed head of the national security agency , lmao ;( ( ( we also got [ these guys ] ( http://www.fibank.bg/ ) destroying forests to illegally build ski resorts . 
  and people protest against that yet nothing changes . 
  similar situation at the black sea coastline . 
  the only thing worse than the government is the court , tho . 
  i do n't even want to get started because honestly , it 's just too shameful . 
  but we do know what they 've been doing . 
  we know enough to justify impaling them and displaying their rotting bodies @ independence square as a tourist attraction . 
  without * any * intention of devaluing romania 's achievement - damn , guys , you got extremely fortunate to get a bunch of responsible people in the judiciary system . 
  well they are pouring millions into my country for education , culture and tourism among other things . 
  every now and then volunteers come to help people in poor , remote regions - medical personnel or teachers . 
  i 'm not saying it 's having enough impact but they are . 
  and as much as i hate saying it , they 've done far more for bulgaria than the eu which seems to only care about gaining another market for their corporations . 
  anyway , i digress . 
  what i 'm trying to say is that the eu is a joke atm . 
  i love the idea of a federal union but right now , they only thing that guarantees my safety is the us . 
  and certainly not the corporate puppets in the council . 
  edit : typo - . -, 
  let 's hope uncle sam has a plan . 
  what if the central powers won ww1 . 
  where do i apply for lordship ? 
  yes , i went through her facebook page . 
  at first i assumed she was a model or an actress so i went through her facebook page but now that 3 of you have confirmed that she 's not famous due to her profession or family or whatever , i guess it makes sense that i could n't find much info . 
  would you mind translating some of the wisdom she 's shared with the lithuanian society :  ? 
  i find silly people fascinating : , 
  she 's really pretty , tho . 
  10/10 would bang . 
  and that 's coming from a gay guy . 
  who is she and why are you calling her an attention whore ;p ? 
  put it on a trajectory to moscow . 
  the russkies like to boast about their rockets - let 's see how good they actually are :  / j obviously, 
  ye , 3 national catastrophes for the sole purpose of liberating those lands and the people who live there . 
  tens of thousands of bulgarians died in those wars , billions in economical damage and you just say ` i 'm glad we fucked this up 'cause we might have had to deal with albania ' . 
  lovely . 
  the last time they had an issue with albania the bulgarian government donated 100 t55 tanks and 100 m30 howitzers . 
  and we 've got nothing against the macedonians - they 're our semi-retarded bros but we still love them . 
  but when it comes to diplomatic affairs or social issues you can clearly see the murican trail . 
  they also finance a few newspapers that selectively do or do n't criticise all sorts of issues depending on the political climate . 
  it 's just weird . 
  like a spy novel or something ... but i 'm not making it up . 
  http://www.americaforbulgaria.org/grants/view/2gwcxlqz -- that 's 1.5 million euros handed over to that media holding . 
  https://www.edx.org/ - watch course in hd ( ` cuz hd cool ) , learn material , emigrate to england , take english job and monnies , take english welfare -  profit . 
  i doubt any other balkan country would be admitted to the eu until the issues with organized crime in bulgaria are resolved . 
  romania seems to be doing pretty well but we 're frozen in the 2000 's when it comes to politics . 
  macedonia has the exact same issues as we do except our government is on a us leash . 
  the country is literally being run by the us ambassador lol . 
  so until things get to normal here , i would n't expect the eu to shoot themselves in the leg by admitting another country run by the mafia . 
  do n't you need a us credit card to pay for the service as well ? 
  when vplay.ro went down i mourned for a week :( and it 's basically unusable now ;( ( ( we are sorry but , this service is currently not available in your country ), 
  bulgaria . 
  but people are usually nice even if they do n't have a good opinion of the country . 
  however , if you talk with enough foreigners , at least one of them will be retarded and say something extremely offensive . 
  and it 's usually germans ;d to be honest many western europeans are far more courteous than a lot of people here tho . 
  you jelly yurop - i can pirate 3x faster than most of you : , 
  a german told me we 're all criminals  .  a swede told me we speak russian  .  a brit asked if we have universities over here  .  an american told me we eat rodents to survive  . , 
  [ or something that 's not older than my parents ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40tvsmln7la ) [ or this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teul6qrgbuq ) edit ; derped and posted wrong link tehee ;p, 
  hey !, 
  [ lions are cool ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/logo_of_ministry_of_defense_of_bulgaria.svg/2000px-logo_of_ministry_of_defense_of_bulgaria.svg.png ) !, 
  but yeah , i agree , that logo is really slick . 
  i love the sci-fi motifs mixed with the crown . 
  being into computer graphics , i 'm totally using that if i ever end up working on a sci-fi military game ;p, 
  i was about to say that us and hungary should consider changing the insignias and then i saw norway 's . 
  god are those ugly . 
  the french and the canadians appear to have a boner for barcodes . 
  denmark wins . 
  i could go on and talk about typical balkan food but i 'd rather focus on stuff that 's not a google search away :p [ meatballs in white sauce ] ( http://media.snimka.bg/6099/018452662.jpg ) [ roasted peppers with garlic ] ( http://www.bulgarian-kitchen.com/fullimg/11516/1.jpg ) -- this goes soooo well with meat :p [ kozunak ] ( http://www.bulgarian-kitchen.com/fullimg/5932/2.jpg ) -- this is basically a cake with fruits ( typically dried grapes ) and chocolate and people tend to buy it on christmas . 
  [ potato balls with onion and white cheese ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-orftleicwwq/vrghs-hxwji/aaaaaaaahzq/vwxjjtk3dte/s1600/p1010226-crop%2b%d1%84%d1%81.jpg ) -- sometimes those are made with red pepper or herbs and sour cream or whatever . 
  there are dozens of recipes . 
  the main point is the mashed potatoes that are then mixed with something else and fried .
