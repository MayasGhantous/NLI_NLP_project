  [ cake with walnuts , apples and honey ] ( https://favouriterecipess.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/apple-walnut-cake.jpg ) [ buzz syrop ] ( http://cookingtiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/%d0%a1%d0%b8%d1%80%d0%be%d0%bf-%d0%be%d1%82-%d0%b1%d1%8a%d0%b7.jpg ) -- so , i do n't know what the plant that we 've named [ buz ] ( http://www.monitor.bg/img/?id=112321&amp;sz=0&amp;cut=yes ) is called in english ;( . 
  other than that - you just gather the ` flowers ' , put them in water for 72h then remove them , add a shitton of sugar and that 's that . 
  you can ferment it or simply mix it with vodka , tho xd honestly , i could keep going until forever . 
  what people on this subreddit call ` balkan ' food is anything but balkan . 
  it 's simply a few turkish dishes that most people are familiar with and balkan countries have * so much more * to offer . 
  oh , we know . 
  turns out the japanese are digging it ;p also our folk music \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  damn turks even brought microbes to us / s, 
  well , it smells and tastes that way so ... xd, 
   four months pregnant , the wife , diana ramazanova , began making arrangements to leave syria and travel to frederikstad to give birth . 
   she made it as far as istanbul , the turkish capital . 
  there , on jan. 6 , she blew herself up in a suicide attack on a turkish police post , killing a police officer and her own unborn baby . 
  what the actual fuck !??? 
  i 've seen cows and sheep munch grass in the park if that counts =d seriously , tho - you can see squirrels and hedgehogs in my neighbourhood but it 's a rare sight . 
  i 've seen pictures of rabbits and whatnot coming from norway and it 's nowhere near that . 
  i would n't add sofia to that list . 
  not with the standard raised that high . 
  yeah , it 's very similar here . 
  i 've got 2 kindergardens , 3 schools , a clinic , 2 tennis courts , 3 football terrains , plenty of those small playgrounds for kids between the buildings , small shops ( some of them 24/7 ) , restaurants , a mall and like 5 supermarkets - all less than 5 minutes away by foot . 
  we also got an apartment in one of the new neighbourhoods and even tho the building is new and cool and pretty and in general the apartment feels larger , the streets turn into swamps in the spring/autumn , there 's no central heating ( which is somewhat ok considering electricity is not * that * expensive here ) but what 's worse is the materials used in general - you can literally hear the footsteps of your neighbours when it 's really quiet ( think 2am for example ) . 
  and if you want to get somewhere , your only options are a car or a long walk to the nearest bus stop . 
  commie buildings are very , very ugly tho . 
  that 's undeniable . 
  however , i think as people get wealthier here , they 'll most certainly invest in thermal isolation and that usually gives the buildings a better look . 
  the government here has been trying to get home owners to organize and decide on colors and stuff and isolate the entire building . 
  there 's an option where the eu pays 75 % of the whole thing . 
  sadly , people still do n't have the money for that ; / here 's how it * could * look , tho : http://pravatami.bg/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/www.monitor.jpg http://econ.bg/pictures/196521_300_225.jpg sure , it 's not amazing but i think it 's not ugly either  edit : i forgot to mention this but in case anyone 's curious how come the eu is paying 75 % of this yet people are generally not going for this option - after reading up on the issue , it turns out the government has contracts with certain construction companies and you can only choose one of them . 
  and of course , the price is way above what you 'd get from freelance workers and your own materials . 
  also , turns out you need to apply for a grant with a bank instead of getting the money directly which adds even more to the price . 
  long story short - eu project abused to milk the population . 
  sooo , what are we looking at here ? 
  historically , my favourite bulgarian would be [ simeon i of bulgaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/simeon_i_of_bulgaria ) . 
  many people associate him with the territorial expansion of the country but what 's more important is his and his father 's [ boris i of bulgaria ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_i_of_bulgaria ) contribution to the bulgarian culture . 
  under those 2 guys , bulgaria became the cultural center of the slavic world . 
  the cyrillic script and the [ old bulgarian language ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/old_church_slavonic ) ( old church slavonic ) became the de fact lingua franca of eastern europe and the balkans and our literature and works of art spread through the continent . 
  until certain kebap came in the 14th century , ofc . 
  =d  simeon was the bulgarian charlemagne , but he was better educated than our charles the great and much greater than him , for he laid down the foundations of literature that belonged to the people a random quote you can find under his wiki page ;p if we 're talking about events , that would be undeniably the [ unification ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bulgarian_unification ) which gave serbia a reason to attack us , leading to the [ serbo-bulgarian war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbo-bulgarian_war ) or as most people know it - the first time we gave serbia a boot in the ass . 
  as far as battles go - there 's the [ battle of doiran ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_doiran_%281917%29 ) against gb , french and greek soldiers , with general [ vladimir vazov ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vladimir_vazov ) being credited with the brilliant defense . 
  another one would be the [ battle of dobrich ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_dobrich ) against the russian empire and romania . 
  we have an inside joke here . 
  we win the battles and germans lose the wars . 
  it 's not far from the truth . 
  oh , so you were n't being passive-aggressive and i simply misunderstood the intent behind that link . 
  you 've got my apologies !, 
  well , if that 's the case then yeah , sure , you 're absolutely right - today , macedonia is a separate country and i doubt they 'd want a union with bulgaria . 
   independent sources in europe between 1878 and 1918 generally tended to view the slavic population of macedonia in two ways : as bulgarians and as macedonian slavs . 
  basically what i said . 
  and in addition you 're claiming it was ok for greece and serbia to fight for clay . 
  and to top it off you try to put us in the same cup . 
  well , we did n't massacre serbs and greeks for one so that 's that . 
  ( and yes , i am aware of certain individual accidents but it was n't a national policy to behave like a barbarian )  everyone goes to war for territorial gains that 's extremely offensive . 
  hopefully you realise why . 
  and do n't ever say it out loud in bulgaria or you might get your teeth scattered on the ground . 
  genuine friendly advice  anyway , there 's nothing to add really so i 'll just let this discussion go . 
  it 's ancient history anyway . 
  cheers !, 
  i 'd call you a dumb chimp but instead i 'll link to you their national anthem before the yugoslav serbs got to massacre them [ again ] ( https://translate.google.bg/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fbg.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2f%25d0%25a1%25d0%25ba%25d0%25be%25d0%25bf%25d1%2581%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b8_%25d0%25b2%25d0%25be%25d0%25b9%25d0%25bd%25d0%25b8%25d1%2588%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b8_%25d0%25b1%25d1%2583%25d0%25bd%25d1%2582&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) and [ again ] ( https://translate.google.bg/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=bg&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fbg.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2f%25d0%259c%25d0%25b0%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b5%25d0%25b4%25d0%25be%25d0%25bd%25d1%2581%25d0%25ba%25d0%25b0_%25d0%25b8%25d0%25bc%25d0%25b8%25d0%25b3%25d1%2580%25d0%25b0%25d1%2586%25d0%25b8%25d1%258f_%25d0%25b2_%25d0%2591%25d1%258a%25d0%25bb%25d0%25b3%25d0%25b0%25d1%2580%25d0%25b8%25d1%258f ) as promised , here 's their defacto national anthem 'till 1944 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2k4xuaczme which was later banned as bulgarophilic . 
  worth mentioning that the macedonian ` language ' was artificially created during those years between ww1 and the end of ww2 . 
  what you hear in that song is * pure * bulgarian . 
  / / seriously , tho ... why do you give your opinion on things that you know nothing about ? 
  i 'd understand if you asked but throwing those links in a passive-aggressive manner is just lowly . 
  worth mentioning that * every single * bulgarian revolutionary and major politician was [ russophobic ] ( https://translate.google.bg/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.extremecentrepoint.com%2farchives%2f335&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) europe literally did what the russian empire was hoping they would do - they alienated the bulgarian society . 
  utter incompetence . 
  and we see the same from them with ukraine today . 
  [ ethnic map balkans 19th century ] ( https://www.google.bg/search?q=ethnic+map+balkans+19th+century&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=965&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ei=ie4bvy3acy_jats0gfam&amp;ved=0cacq_auoaq ), 
  it genuinely pisses me off when people talk about land . 
  no , it was n't about land . 
  it was about 1/2 the bulgarian population that were living outside the borders of our country and massacred by our neighbors . 
  it was about land for you , for greece and for the serbs . 
  for us , it was about our people . 
  and thanks to that german douche and his british buddies , serbia got the leading role on the balkans in the following years . 
  today , the results are there for everyone to see  but yeah , he 's great . 
  i 'm sure the ukrainians think merkel is great as well , 
  \u043e .0 excuse for what ? 
  indeed , not to mention there are a couple of sieges missing here . 
  the list is ( probably ) way longer . 
  fun fact - the ottomans only gained entry to the balkans thanks to a huge earthquake that destroyed one of the greek fortresses in their way . 
  talk about luck ... 
   from the eur 1,000 per person that bulgaria receives from the eu as aid to improve the quality of life for the refugees , it now appears that even bgn 65 / eur 33 was too much money to reach the intended objective . 
  that !, 
  wtf . 
  i thought they are on our expense so ... well , we 're not a rich country so it would make sense that the government ca n't provide a good environment for them . 
  but 1k euros / person from the eu and only 3 meals a day and a shitty place to live ? 
  any bulgarian here who can explain to me how come 3x the average salary is not enough to provide for these guys ? 
  where does the money go ? 
  any official information ? 
  til irish teens are like bulgarian grannies, 
  ehm , it 's a tad more complicated . 
  you see , the soviets ( just like putin 's regime today ) were exceptionally good at dehumanizing the victims . 
  creating a hateful society and showing them * who * to hate is a very productive tactic . 
  that 's how violence against gay people can be justified . 
  it 's * just * them - faggots - and they 're nothing but * faggots * .
