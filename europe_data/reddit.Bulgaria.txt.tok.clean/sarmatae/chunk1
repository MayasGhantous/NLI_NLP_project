ukraine says a lot of things . 
  i would say that `` revival '' is the closest translation , but it also needs the historical context of the word used here . 
  also , no one cares about bulgaria . 
  i ca n't believe that mong got a seat in the real cabinet . 
  also , no one cares about us . 
  the eu is turning us in the storage space for middle eastern immigrants . 
  they do n't want to sit next to the turk . 
  being next to the turkish party has been a political suicide in the last 20 years . 
  would that be really worse than an union that only servers a few core member states as it does now ? 
  of course . 
  there might not be any eu left by then if we are lucky . 
  anyone else find it ironic how the heads of supposedly progressive and liberal university groups wear headscarfs . 
  our courts and prosecutors are still as shit as ever . 
  it 's interesting who is trying to gain from this ? 
  tsatsarov is with the peevski and they have nothing to gain from russia . 
  you mean when you try to play banker , fail and refuse to pay your debts ? 
  you mean when you siphon taxes via loopholes ? 
  you can see that the bear is missing it 's claws and most likely teeth . 
  the gypsies removed those from an early age and beat the animals . 
  it 's sad that we outlawed the practice as late as 1990s . 
  ancient greeks were nazis ? 
  it 's never going to happen . 
   bulgaria is a sovereign state which independently takes decisions related to its security and they ca n't be commented upon by high-ranking representatives of other states , mitov said in a statement . 
  except when mccain shows up to stop south stream . 
  we are such pathetic ass kissing shills . 
  so was greece when they went to war with turkey . 
  i see what the author did there . 
  because mccain and nuland would overthrow him and plunder the country 's resources . 
  he is right . 
  plus , the only security threat to us is the autocracy in the south east and usa is n't going to protect us from their nato friends . 
  http://www.novinite.com/articles/146529/bulgarian+govt+to+buy+third-hand+fighter+jets+from+portugal+-+report our politicians have it all figured out . 
  they will spend almost half a billion dollars that we need for other things to buy 3rd hand f-16s from portugal just to kiss ass . 
  the only option for borisov now is to play the eu parliament card and ask the reformists and kalfin ( former mep ) to support him for `` the sake of stability '' . 
  the reformists will look bad either way and there might be new elections in 2 months with less than 30 % voter turnout . 
  going to be interesting . 
   `` english should become the second language to be taught in schools , '' for english to become the second language russian would have to stop being the second language . 
  you see the problem ? 
  except i studied russian before english . 
  poroshenko is trying to repress the ethnic minorities in his country by imposing english on everyone . 
  what will happen with the ethnic hungarians or bulgarians in ukraine that want to learn another second language ? 
  there is a connection between countries ' educational spending and their level of english . 
  this guy is such a clown . 
  http://lowres.jantoo.com/politics-eastern_question-bulgarian-balkans-brittania-disraeli-99900726_low.jpg they were , unlike britain and france who were actively helping the ottoman genocides in the balkans . 
  also fuck our president , no one gives a shit what mr bean thinks . 
  what a steaming pile of bullshit . 
  what about the osama and the mujahideen in bosnia ? 
  i am too ashamed to say ... 
  i wonder what the reaction to this will be . 
  a couple of months ago people freaked their shit over the hrw 's report on bulgaria and alleged beatings of illegal immigrants on the border . 
  there was no evidence that our police had used excessive force and testimonies were proven false ( some claimed that they were tazed , but our police doesnt use tazers ) yet there were loads of accusations . 
  what now ? 
  well , if germans liked it than they should have put a ring on it . 
  britain did the same with hundreds of thousands of polish soldiers during the second world war . 
  many were `` encouraged '' to leave for canada and usa while most were send straight to stalin after the war . 
   a leader who bows down to the west the unipolar world of the 90s is dead . 
  deal with it . 
  vice are not real journalists , so their shorts are very hyperbolic . 
  this one shows the desperation of a few people and tries to paint the whole country with that brush . 
  it 's not very accurate . 
  a shitty article from a shitty magazine . 
  wasted my time opening the link . 
  it does n't change the fact that their claims and justification were outright lies . 
  more serbian civilians were killed by nato bombs than kosovars over the course of 4 years . 
  http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/29/local/me-27493 nato attacked serbia under the pretext of over 10 000 dead civilians buried in mass graves . 
  the real number was less than 600 many of whom were kla fighters . 
  the british and american lied to justify war just like they did in iraq . 
  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10413004/david-cameron-stance-on-eastern-european-workers-inspired-by-car-factory-visit.html he said that after visiting a car factory . 
  too many of the workers there were from eastern europe so britain has to say `` no !, 
  '' , because eastern europeans are scum . 
  for a 4 person household that pays for a car ( lease ) and a 2 bedroom apartment ( mortgage ) in the capitol you would need around 2000-2200 euro a month . 
  http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=97a_1397122630 i am not a shill like you . 
   ca n't uk citizens live , work and travel throughout the eu quite easily without applying for visas and having lots of hassles ? 
  that is not what the schengen agreement is . 
  schengen means removing borders completely and not requiring people to show their id cards/passports when crossing the border . 
  all soda used to be called schweppes . 
  there are more but i can remember them right now . 
  we call jackboots - kubinki ( \u043a\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0438 ) which derives from cuba for some reason . 
  we also call the sandals without the back part japanki ( \u0434\u0436\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438 ) which derives from japan for some reason ... 
  it 's not like the turks did n't hold back the balkans in the dark ages for 500 years . 
  of course people will remember the genocides and atrocities . 
  many of them were shot by sniper fire from behind . 
  from a opposition held hotel filled with right wing extremists . 
  the head of the prosecution responsible for the investigation is from svoboda ( right wing extremists ) and has been interfering with the investigation . 
  the same happened in odessa where the police is trying to cover up what happened . 
  ftfy, 
  [ than this ? 
  ] ( http://www.abc19.tv/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/388agty_ferguson_protest_mar_140819_16x9_608.jpg ) yes it is . 
   whether it is police violence bullshit . 
  i have yet to see police pointing shotguns at unarmed women and children . 
  will have to see how western ukraine will like the changes that will come when they become eu vassals . 
  much like here they probably just take the number of people registered as unemployed . 
  after 6 months here you stop getting money so people stop showing up to the unemployment bureau which artificially lowers the official unemployment rate . 
  so people are not allowed to point out repressions and police brutality ? 
  http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/two-wounded-ukrainian-anti-aircraft-gunners-blow-themselves-up-together-with-12-russian-paratroopers-362535.html the ukrainians are the ones resorting to suicide bombings . 
  they could hurt russia , but they * will * definitely hurt europe . 
  poroshenko is selling his assets via rothschild so there is that too . 
  running off to die for oligarchs and the imf is not just dumb . 
  it 's idiotic . 
  that news article did n't check who got the money and how they were used . 
  they just reported that the funds are available for opposition parties ** under the pretext of spreading democracy ** .
