  so you have the eu giving the opposition half a billion euro and the opposition organizing riots and throwing molotov cocktails . 
  now strain your lonely brain cell and connect the 2 dots . 
  http://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2014/08/27/2369477_dokumentut_obiavil_rusiia_za_zaplaha_predizvika/ the anti-russian text in the document were rejected . 
  the pm does n't want us to take a side and to be nato `` yes men '' . 
  eu gives 470 million to ukrainian opposition parties - fact eu claims money is for democracy - not fact if you ca n't wrap your head around than that is your own problem . 
   would be best is to advocate neutrality in these matters this is old news . 
  that document was removed from the defense ministry 's website yesterday , because it was `` rough draft '' . 
  in reality it was an attempt to suck up to nato during the wales summit . 
  the current caretaker prime minister said that the document is needlessly hostile and it 's not our job to assign blame and point fingers in this conflict . 
  he is right . 
  nord stream . 
   ** we ** used to rule the fucking world you are the one bragging about it . 
  yeah , killing millions of congolese , chopping their arms off and leaving the continent in perpetual state of war sounds like a riot . 
  http://www.thenation.com/blog/179057/seven-decades-nazi-collaboration-americas-dirty-little-ukraine-secret the eu and usa will fund anyone who is anti-russian even if they are right wing neo-nazies . 
  especially in ukraine and eastern europe . 
   we used to rule the fucking world only a hundred years ago everything was easy when you could commit genocide and no one would care , huh ? 
  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/nov/26/ukraine.usa they always claim that it 's for democracy and civil society , but in reality it 's used for regime change and funding radicals . 
  the source is there to show how much money was supplied to the opposition . 
  what they did with it and the results are evident . 
  that money was used to rile up people on social networks , organize bus trips and buy molotov cocktails . 
  http://www.euractiv.com/specialreport-eu-ukraine-relatio/ukraine-government-split-eu-demo-news-507594  the eu programme for 2011-2013 has a budget of $ 470 million for three years , mainly to bring the eu-ukraine association agreement into force . 
   `` we have a number of gentlemen , specialised in absorbing foreign grants , who stage such developments because a strong ukraine is not needed by anyone abroad , '' he said during a ceremony commemorating the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany . 
  than money was used to fund the unrest last november . 
   are you indicating that the us and eu are to blame for euromaiden ? 
  yes , i do . 
  the eu deal was n't good enough and one of the conditions was the release of tymoshenko . 
  the eu fucked up big time . 
  and there is nothing home grown when the main opposition parties are funded by the eu . 
  460 million euro in the last decade to be used against pro-russian parties . 
  why not wait until the smoke over the last regime change sponsored by the eu and us state department clears a bit before picking the next target for a color revolution ? 
  kazakhstan the greatest country in the world . 
  all the other countries are ran by little girls !, 
  yeah , right . 
  the fact that germany has spend the last 6 years undermining and punishing it 's biggest export markets while capitalizing from the weak euro has nothing to do with that . 
  better them than us . 
  if they call it federalization that they would be admitting defeat to the separatists , but it 's the same thing . 
  ] ( https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7435/11933083165_e690377702.jpg ), 
  there is only one reason that matters - ukraine is running out of money . 
  that is the problem !, 
  world 's largest exporter of potassium . 
  it 's from borat ... 
  according to euronews the price of pork in russia rose by 6 % . 
  hardly `` skyrocketing '' ... 
  probably not . 
  the people responsible for the death camps in belene and lovetch were not russians . 
  they were bulgarian communists . 
  i would also like it if the monuments are taken down and send back . 
  but what i do n't like is that someone decided that he should throw paint on the grave of soldiers just because he hates bsp . 
  the ussr declared war on us on september 5th and we surrendered on september 8th . 
  no resistance , no shots fire and no one killed . 
  the usa and britain bombed sofia for 3 years . 
  they killed 1400 civilians during their indiscriminate bombing missions . 
  http://sofiaglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mapsys-ifo-sofia-bombs-e1357919813646.jpg why do we have a monument of the american pilots that killed civilians ? 
  more suppliers means better prices and less shale gas . 
  less shale gas means less villagers getting beat up by romanian police . 
  the moscow times are actually correct . 
  http://i.imgur.com/q7trb0g.jpg this is the last act of vandalism that caused the russians to ask for better treatment . 
  couple of days ago someone threw a bucket of red paint on a monument that also houses the bones of soviet soldiers . 
  this is actually disgusting . 
   american superheroes are way cooler than stupid soviet propaganda the text under the first recolor was `` get with the times '' ( \u0412 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u043a \u0441 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e ) . 
  it criticizes both the old propaganda and the new one from the west . 
  the new heroes are every bit as fake as the old ones . 
  http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb11.htm easy there goebbles . 
  you do n't know what a comeback is . 
  so this is why fuku22us33hima has so much pent up anger , huh . 
   i could n't care less about the result either way . 
  i really want it to be over . 
  a lot of us feel the same about the brexit . 
   they are welcome to enjoy the benefits of west made me puke in my mouth a little . 
  [ kunda kuchka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gejx59nmtqo ), 
   was careful to obtain documents from the turkish government approving their removal from greece he never produced these documents . 
  he only had an alleged italian translation without any stamps nor signatures . 
  the translation of which allows him to sketch and measure the parthenon and take any ** loose stones ** . 
  he bribes the turks to allow him to remove marbles . 
  he also uses the marbles to decorate his home . 
  he was a thief . 
  the marbles belong in athens . 
  at least it 's not -1 %, 
   bulgaria is still not doing , and slipping back . 
  0.5 % growth compared to q1 , 1.6 % growth compared to q2 of 2013 . 
  80.2 k new jobs and 2.6 % increase on average wages this year . 
  is n't bad . 
  especially when you consider how much we lost from russian tourism decline . 
  oh , i have plenty of issues with the eu . 
  did you even read your own link ? 
  beh limits the foreign companies cez , e-on and energopro from exporting electricity meant for the local market . 
  the eu wants to allow these companies to do what they want with that electricity which will further increase the prices for local consumers . 
  that is not an argument in your favour . 
  the eu sucks . 
   it is bulgarian power companies who do it . 
  and it is bulgarian government that adds taxes . 
  http://www.businessinsider.com/europes-soaring-energy-prices-2013-11  `` the squeeze in real incomes has made customers and voters much more sensitive to the impact of rising utility bills , '' kemp writes . 
  `` and bills have risen so much for so long that increases are starting to spark public resistance . '', 
  utility prices are rising all over the eu , because of the green energy targets . 
  you have no fucking clue . 
  the energy bills are going up precisely because of eu green energy quotas and additional taxes . 
  `` additional factors '' is key . 
  they lost a lot of land during the crimean war when they wanted to free the balkans , but britain and france sided with the turks . 
   there was not a single time throughout a history of time when russia would do anything good to any other country without actually attempting to invade , occupy or otherwise harm it as a result of that aid . 
  russo-turkish war .
