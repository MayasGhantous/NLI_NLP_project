  sadly for romanians and bulgarians working hard does n't mean much when our productivity and pay is very low . 
  he is a well known self defeatist so it 's safe to assume that he means that we are lazy too . 
  apparently most germans are n't blinded by revanchism . 
   bulgarian tobacco company ** bulgartabac , one of corpbank 's prominent clients ** , also announced earlier this week it was taking its accounts out of the bank . 
  important line right here . 
  tsvetan vasilev who is the guy in charge of the bank is called `` putin 's guy '' . 
  he used to be very close to delyan peevski , but they had a falling out during the protests last year when both their names were tarnished . 
  vasilev started his own political project called bulgaria without censorship which got 10 % of the eu votes and 2 meps . 
  after that ** peevski , who owns bulgartabac , stopped servicing his bank credits worth a lot of money ** . 
  the two have been using the media and state prosecution to attack each other for over a week now . 
  they are linked to projects like south stream and other which did n't work out well for them recently . 
  it is speculated that some oligarchs want to bring the bank down in order to default on their credits . 
  other go as far as to suggest that some oligarchs want to bring down the whole monetary board that pegs our lev to the euro in order to escape their loans like they did in 1997 which was the time of the so called `` credit millionaires '' . 
  the situation is very murky , but at the core it 's a mafia war . 
  the americans refuse to regulate their financial sector while they want to deregulate european consumer protection and food safety . 
  the ttip is a terrible deal for europe . 
  that is enough , but the more information comes out the worse it looks . 
  and how well did picking the side of germany work out last time ? 
  as the ancient tibetan philosophy states `` do n't start none , wo n't be none . '', 
  i 'd rather spend more money on schools and hospitals , but i am weird like that . 
  so they want to expand the market for german and french arms even further by making countries buy their stuff ? 
   how many aircraft did bulgaria contribute to that cause again ? 
  luckily none . 
  killing for oil really is n't on our list of priorities . 
  also if you cared so much about the kurds why do n't you write to your congressmen to stop their lap dog from killing them in turkey ? 
  bulgaria and serbia are easy to bully while the first class eu countries can do what they want . 
  i did n't see any clues nor evidence . 
  only a few far fetched claims and conspiracy theories . 
  also a lot of attention shifting . 
  i would love for us to leave the pyramid scheme and warmongerers club . 
  you mean we do n't suck us dick cause we are revanchist russophobe little shits like you ( personally ) ? 
  the ussr did n't kill any bulgarian civilians . 
  they did n't fire any shots . 
  the invasion started on september 8th and ended on september 9th . 
  unlike the romanians we refused to declare war on russia and never sent soldiers to the eastern front despite hitler 's demands . 
  in the end of the day we even got to keep dobruja . 
  while since we have been `` allied '' with the warmongerers in washington dozens of our soldiers have been killed in iraq and afghanistan . 
  fuck you . 
   has participated in the war in yugoslavia and greece bull shit . 
  we did n't take part in the war on greece and yugoslavia . 
  the murder of over 1400 was part of the allied terrorism plan , just like the firebombings of japan and the destruction of dresden . 
  the ussr did n't kill nearly as many civilians as the allies . 
  http://euobserver.com/eu-elections/123199 you should get used to it since there are a lot of `` people like me '' that see the eu as the failure that it really is . 
  our country was bombed by usa and britain as well . 
  night runs focusing on civilians . 
  killing 1375 people in sofia alone . 
  a campaign of terror and indiscriminate killing for which neither has apologized yet . 
  people here still remember the black easter . 
  so you have no response ? 
  figures . 
   it is not an ally , it is a rich douchebag , you either pander to him or he starts bulling you , you are never equal , your interest do not matter . 
  ** post ww2 ** there is only america or `` evil '' . 
  none of your rants are post ww2 . 
  you are clueless . 
  you are wasting everyone 's time . 
  you need to be insane to deny the imperial aggression of the usa around the world since the end of ww2 . 
  ** the bay of pigs , vietnam war and the support for saddam hussein ** are just a few notable examples . 
  how well did that work out last time ? 
  oh right , they did n't provide shit . 
  it was israel that warned about attacks in feb 2012 and the bombing still happened 4 months later . 
  how is that worse than being an european ghetto that houses all of the unwanted refugees and gets shat on by british media every few months ? 
  when serbia was flooded the eu sprung into action after a few hours , but now 5 days after varna was flooded there has been 0 support anywhere . 
  yatsenyuk wants to block south stream so that his party 's gas firms can continue to steal gas while we continue to pay the 2nd highest gas price in europe and the commission do what he wants . 
  the eu and usa are full of shit . 
  we have never seen anything good from them . 
  so they should kindly fuck off . 
  without russian imperialism we would still be part of the ottoman empire and subjects to genocide like the kurds . 
  how about you come up with something relevant ? 
  i was annoyed with sikorski in the last few months , but now i think that he is the best politician in all of europe . 
  september 11th 1973 . 
  ** the cia helps augusto pinochet ** overthrow a democratically elected president who leans a bit too far to the left for the us tastes . 
  30 000 dissents were arrested and tortured while at least 3 000 were killed . 
  some were pregnant women drugged and then dropped in the amazon river from planes and helicopters . 
  lets not forget the contras or the guatemalan genocides also facilitated by the cia or the actions of the dea in columbia and mexico . 
   they are based near villages so mostly old people meet them and they are pleased . 
  they are whoring around and drinking . 
  they do n't pay rent for the bases they use . 
  they should just leave . 
  russia treated eastern europe better than the usa treated south america so there is that . 
  latest reports say that at least 10 people have died . 
  many still missing . 
  i like eastern europe . 
  all the nobodies that vocally trash talk their own home country . 
  it 's really annoying when you read local message boards or news comments to see the same type of a-holes spewing vitriol and hate from abroad . 
  they have made their choice and should shut up about it . 
  they know full well that they are second grade expats and they crawl back home every summer in order to pretend how great they are doing . 
  http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/country_focus/2013/pdf/cf_vol10_issue2_en.pdf bulgaria has had the fastest growing wages in all of europe in the last 5 years . 
  a lot of it of course due to the contraction of the grey economy , but still . 
  http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/05/07/uk-bulgaria-autos-idukkbn0dn0qi20140507 it 's it sector is growing and in demand of specialists . 
  it 's car parts manufacturing sector is growing very fast already making up 4.5 % of all exports . 
  your hatred clouds your judgement , so it 's pointless to talk to you any further . 
  and yet , here i stand . 
   hopelessly delusional stay still better than being bitter and spewing venom against your own country on the internet . 
  4 partiest at the moment . 
  * gerb who are supposed to be center right but are linked to oligarchs and suffocated small business during their term . 
  * the socialist who are former communists whith no clue how to run a country . 
  they keep taking loans to fund small increases in pensions , but are linked to oligarchs and the eu cut their funding for corruption suspicions . 
  * the rights and freedoms aka turkish party . 
  they have been in ruling coalitions from 1997 to 2009 . 
  during that time they turned their ethnic regions into strongholds .
