  people that do n't vote for them lose their jobs or cant sell their produce . 
  they are a criminal organization , not a party . 
  they have around 350 000 solid voters which is why they dont want high election participation . 
  * ataka who are far right by name only . 
  they are political corpses . 
  they have supported the current government for over a year and their voters dropped them for other populists . 
  the current government will fall next week . 
  if we are lucky there will be compulsory voting and barekov ( the new populist actor ) will lose his funding . 
  the least tainted party is the reformist bloc , but they are not that clean either . 
  there are a few reasons why the protests are picking up speed again . 
  * delyan peevsky who was the catalyst for the #danswithme protests was ** elected for european parliament as part of the turkish party ** which was a smack in the face to every normal person in the country . 
  * the election results were a sound defeat for the socialists which made them uneasy * the socialists decided to switch ministers around and demand bigger representation in the government which made the turkish party unhappy . 
  the turks threatened that they would leave the coalition . 
  * the socialists called the bluff and said that they want new elections and compulsory voting which would make the turkish party one of the worst performers since they have a solid but small voter base of illiterate and controlled constituencies . 
  * these `` power games '' pissed off a lot of people since they represent everything that is wrong with the oligarchic system which the protesters marched against . 
  * ** peevski was supposedly the target of attempted murder by his long time partner in crime tsvetan vasilev ** . 
  people believe that the whole thing is a circus act aimed to weaken vasilev who had a falling out with the turkish party and started his own project - barekov . 
  all of this motivated people to come out again . 
  the article has a point . 
  it 's really tiresome to see the eu institutions and media constantly trying to tarnish hungary and present it like some authoritarian hell hole , just because they dislike the elected majority . 
  good for austria . 
  too bad no one here has the courage to do the same when davutoglu visits demanding mosques and claiming that the 16th century was `` the best period '' for our and other balkan countries . 
  then it would be historically accurate . 
  him pissing is a bit crude . 
  they should instead have a statue of lenin taking money from the keiser to fund his `` people 's revolution '' . 
  nope . 
  the embassies of france and the netherlands are regular two story houses here . 
  have n't stolen any british jobs yet . 
   china made a much better/cheaper deal with russia !, 
  china has a lot of cheap alternatives . 
  we do n't . 
  http://www.novinite.com/articles/159077/bulgaria%27s+court+finds+13+imams+guilty there were 13 imams who were prosecuted for spreading religious hatred and being funded by salafist/wahhabi organizations from saudi arabia . 
  they got slaps on the wrists . 
  we 've had turks for the last 600 years and they still `` do n't feel appreciated '' nor speak the language . 
  it 's not germany 's fault . 
   ** romania ** shouldnt be in the european union you ca n't even name the correct country in question . 
  and other countries will veto the common gas market . 
   more like with lack of balls exactly . 
  the eu cut the funding for 4 programs and threatened to start punitive actions against bulgaria for building south stream + mccain came to `` talk about diversification '' and now the project is stopped . 
  instead of 380 $ we will continue to pay 500 $ + next time ukraine stops paying will blow it . 
  it 's a year too late for this . 
  the current government beat people and lied it 's way until the eu elections . 
  they borrowed a lot of money and screwed up a lot of projects . 
  the ethnic turks played the socialists like a fiddle and are now going to discard them . 
  all of the problems started with the appointment of peevski who is part of the dps . 
  the next elections will likely be just as inconclusive . 
  gerb will barely get over 30-35 % so they will need to form a coalition , but no one wants to work with them either . 
   at least they 're not meant to aggravate anybody that is the biggest problem of this subreddit . 
  every step away from the circle jerk will be viciously down voted . 
  this is why most people do n't bother, 
  the ngos operating here are full of shit . 
  they even wanted the release from prison of a repeat rapist , because `` he could n't get good enough treatment in prison '' . 
  http://www.bghelsinki.org/en/publications/obektiv/stoiko-stoikov/2011-08/counting-macedonians-bulgaria/ they also have all kings of stupid and worthless campaigns where they slander the country and launder money . 
  if these ngos are like the ones that operate here then good job . 
  dozens of pedestrians were hit by this cluster bomb . 
  most of the killed had nothing to do with the building . 
  get your head out of your ass and stop chewing washington 's bullshit . 
  the hit the park and street . 
  they killed 15 civilians . 
  they ca n't sanction france or germany , because they would fight back . 
  they can only push their rules on the weak members . 
  is this the onion ? 
  that plumbing money goes a long way . 
  i do n't see how them electing oligarchs will bring them closer to europe , but most of these articles are so biased that reading them is a waste of time . 
  every big politicians in the last 20 years deserves at least 5 years in jail and a lifetime ban from holding public office . 
  kostov for the shady privatisation , the king for the forests and national properties , dogan for tsankov kamuk , stanishev for everything and borisov for his deals as mayor of sofia . 
  sadly this is only the first instance and tsvetanov is likely to avoid prison by the end . 
  can we focus on the rest of his speech ? 
  this guy continues to block recovery efforts for southern europe and demands austerity . 
  he suggests that europe should lower it 's social and safety standards to compete with usa and china . 
  he wants to strip countries from their power to control their own budgets . 
  if he wants the anti-eu vote to stop growing he should shut the fuck up for a few years . 
   he russians want to restrict south stream for transport of russian gas only , which is against eu law . 
  that is why eu is opposing it . 
  the same was true for north stream , but it was build . 
  the commission is playing politics with russia while we continue pay the second most expensive gas in europe , because we pay transit fees to ukraine and romania . 
  we do n't want them as enemies , but they will never be our friends either . 
  especially with the shit the turkish minority party pulls here . 
  not going to happen when the turkish foreign minister calls for pan-ottomanism and their geography books claim lands from all of their neighbours . 
  they were n't . 
  your own wiki link says that they assimilated other cultures instead of spreading their own . 
  i suggest you follow op 's advice and learn more about the balkans . 
  what advances did the ottoman bring exactly ? 
  they held the balkans back for centuries . 
  why is that good exactly ? 
  turning ukraine hostile to russia which is it 's biggest trading partner will leave the country in an even bigger mess than it already is . 
  they wo n't be offered eu or nato membership either . 
  just empty promises . 
   22 % of the ep the ep is the weakest part of the eu institutions like the article clearly states + common sense . 
  the fact that junker and schaeuble have called for an eurozone parliament controlled by france and germany . 
  means that it will likely happen . 
  well , it looks like more and more politicians are openly talking about the `` two tier europe '' where a franco-german core will make most decisions while the rest just follows along and provides a source of cheap labor and markets . 
  small town next to the greek border . 
  most of the tourists are greek people that come to shop all kinds of stuff . 
  more and more every year . 
  half the advertisement signs are already in greek . 
  no thanks . 
   `` there is not one europe but two ... 
  in the euro zone , we must stop believing in the myth of equal rights between all members . '', 
  glad someone finally adimited what we already knew .
