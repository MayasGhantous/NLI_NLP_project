  the ones i voted for last time ca n't get their own shit together and make ` historic compromises ' every week or so , my opinion on the rest is also more negative than before . 
  although these are local elections so we 're voting mostly for individuals . 
   economy , tackling corruption , incentives for having children are my priorities too . 
  fair to who ? 
  the refugees ? 
  surely not , germany , germany !, 
  and all . 
  to the countries who will have to take them ? 
  no way , as they will be expensive and many of them have no documents and there is no way to know who they are . 
  the soviets were extremely brutal in afghanistan , it would have been no better . 
  yup , anyone who thinks the people who riot and protest will be happy when they are in germany is deluded . 
  they will just demand more . 
   the police have a duty to care for people until they do n't . 
  also the lies about the guy who forced his wife and child onto the rail tracks , with multiple sources blaming the police and manipulting the footage . 
   some will end up in bulgaria and romania that 's what i 'm afraid of . 
  at least we stopped taking anyone without documents as a refugee , and then we will be expected to take in unknown people who have never been screened again . 
  they will go back to germany as soon as possible , but it 's still not a good idea . 
  i 'd rather have russia as an occupying enemy than chechen mercenaries as allies . 
  but you have the problem that migrants are afraid to be registered in hungary as they may be forced to stay there . 
  economic left/right : -0.63 social libertarian/authoritarian : -2.56 about what i expected , as i consider myself a centrist and somewhat liberal . 
   while funding the construction of mosques all over europe , and elsewhere . 
  they also fund preaching a particular brand of islam that is a little intolerant toward others . 
   turn your country into a sweden really ? 
  then why the fuck are n't we welcoming all of them here , damn we 're dumb . 
   as tourists we 're pretty awful in general that 's quite interesting as people in the tourist business here love russians as they rarely complain about the shitty services many of them provide . 
  i 'm just wondering , those guys , whenever anyone tries to stop them on their way to germany , protest and are ready to riot . 
  if they like it there it 's all good , but what happens if they find germany/sweden not to be perfect ? 
  will they demand , protest again ? 
   5 bologna  the city therefore stands at number 7 in the list of most racist cities in europe . 
  most relevant media is actually not against refugees though . 
  and internet comments are usually / pol / tier anyway for many of the sites . 
  we still have thousands here , and a lot are still coming . 
  [ 6 % of refugees in bulgaria have more than primary education . 
  maybe you should tag this as nsfw . 
  such a horrible way to die . 
  crammed in a truck like you 're not even human , slowly suffocating . 
  the next step is little green men to help latvia join russia . 
  if you think the eu can do fine after the exit of its second largest economy you are delusional . 
  are you a terrorist then ? 
  and do n't say no , all terrorists say that . 
  falls for scam or is part of scam ? 
  yes , actually . 
  i understand that the person is afraid that he will be forced to leave because of gentrification , but the rest of article mostly consists of complaining about everything and everyone . 
  white people are white and spooky . 
  gues who else is white and spooky ? 
  you guessed right , it 's mr. skeltal . 
  doot doot sheeple !, 
  woo we win this !, 
  25 % decline from 1989 , 27 % further by 2050 . 
  i think the difference is that there the ruling elite never even pretended to lose their power . 
  is this some kind of a bot ? 
  maybe , but i 've also been drunk and i still have n't pissed on children for not being ` aryan ' . 
  [  altruistic intention ] ( http://www.bulgarianhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/%d1%81%d0%be%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b0%d0%bb%d0%b8%d1%81%d1%82%d0%b8%d1%87%d0%b5%d1%81%d0%ba%d0%b8-%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b3%d0%b5%d1%80%d0%b8.jpg ) those are all forced labor camps , 100 in bulgaria alone , nobody knows how many people were there as most were sent without a trial . 
  11 million , actually . 
  now fuck off . 
  when they were making a first agreement , some countries were against it because they thought they would be forced to do it again and again . 
  so the eu 's response is ... exactly what those countries feared ? 
  no it wo n't , the reason it was introduced in the first place was the constant posting about immigration . 
  i do n't think they 're talking about us , and we do have a lot of people coming and getting refugee status anyway . 
  damn , that 's brutal , how will norwegians live through it ? 
  really though , forests are cool . 
  the last time bulgaria had a life expectancy below 70 was 1962 so this data seems off . 
  most people like them , but they sadly are n't enforced well enough . 
  fuck , those are huge numbers , we have about 10000 asylum applications , 6000 are likely to be returned here from other eu countries , it 's not known well how many people are not not even registered . 
  and many countries have numbers that are many times larger . 
  honestly , borders wo n't stop this , there are too many people coming . 
  something needs to be done in their home countries but then again anything western countries do in the mena region seems to backfire . 
  russian gas pipes are bad unless they go directly to germany , it seems . 
  danube is also very low everywhere , forest fires in a bunch of countries , it 's a heavy summer for sure . 
  http://ime.bg/bg/articles/zabavya-li-se-vyzstanovyavaneto-na-pazara-na-truda/ there it is . 
  no graph though . 
  it 's still not rosy at all . 
  [ this ] ( http://ime.bg/var/images/lmq22015.png ) is net job creation , the increase is way slower than the decreases before it . 
  also all jobs were created in varna and sofia , everywhere else had a decrease in employment or it stayed the same . 
  yeah , we need context here . 
  not very likely as they 're all old . 
  it sounds like quite a big difference to me . 
  i have n't read a lot of his stuff , but yes , he was a good writer . 
  it was built strictly as a monument of an ideology so rational arguments about it are not possible . 
  such is life, 
  we have those too . 
  they truly are great to consume alcohol with . 
  is there any serious opposition ? 
  because i 'm seeing that the last one was won with 90 % turnout and 80 % for lukashenko . 
  damn , that sub is awesome  1300 years from now , rampaging hordes of sjws will be slaughtering unbelievers and creating a caliphate ... 
  wait , op is from russia and posted that reddit is blocked in russia . 
  what a time to be alive . 
  ( yeah yeah i know it 's very easy to bypass ), 
  honestly , all those conspiracy theories include russia as the solution so it makes me think where they come from . 
  the same thing was proposed here for kindergartens but it 's unlikely to pass as there 's no real demand for it . 
  we are extremely fucked when it comes to demographics , probably past the point of no return . 
  you white supremacists are so dumb you do n't even know how to racism . 
  seriously , you can get hundreds of upvotes if something racist is worded properly here . 
  oh we have a lot of people who think russia can do no wrong but you 'll never see them on reddit . 
  great job bleeding hearts , now make sure to keep giving money to crime bosses ( where most of the money goes , do you think beggars who have nothing can just move to sweden without someone helping them ? 
  ) , they create a lot of job for beggars and mansion builders . 
  roma people from the ghettos , all the time . 
  with their own as they do n't care that some redditor told them to abolish armies . 
  yes and people do that but you ca n't unhave children once they are born . 
  i did n't see it .
