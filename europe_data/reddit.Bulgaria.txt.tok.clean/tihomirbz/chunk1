[ relevant ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-3243137/the-world-s-largest-super-yacht-revealed-russian-billionaire-s-260m-mega-yacht-300ft-high-eight-floors-underwater-observation-room.html ), 
  `` refugees '', 
  you also have to take into account the difference in prices between countries . 
  you can barely survive with 700 pounds / euros in countries like the uk / germany , but live a very comfortable life in bulgaria with it . 
  take a look at [ this comparison ] ( http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=united+kingdom&amp;country2=bulgaria&amp;city1=london&amp;city2=sofia ) despite that , the standard of living is still worse in ee , which is why so many people have left their home countries for the west ( which also causes a gigantic brain drain in ee , but that 's a story for another time ) . 
  after the mess it stirred up in iraq and libya , i guess the west thought third time must be the charm . 
  learning how to say 5 words is not enough for holding a proper conversation . 
  ok , i walk in a shop , say bonjour , then what ? 
  i have to switch to english since that and bulgarian are the only languages i 'm fluent in . 
  i switch to english , but the shopping assistant does n't speak or refuses to speak english , what do we do then ? 
  never had any problems using only english when visited germany , but when in france people tend to have a noticeable condescending attitude towards english-speakers . 
   you are in france , speak the damn language at least a little when you go to russia do you speak russian with the locals ? 
  or if you visit china for a week , do you speak chinese there ? 
  you people act as if everyone around the world knows/has studied french and if they visit france they should be able to freely speak french . 
  the 19th century is over , english is the modern day world language , if the rest of the world can accept it so can you . 
  that 's a huge underestimate . 
  [ spain boasting an expat population of just over 1m uk citizens ] ( http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5cd640f6-9025-11e3-a776-00144feab7de.html ) [ the country breakdown says just over 1 million british people live in spain . 
  ] ( https://euobserver.com/social/123066 ) anyway , this was not the point of my comment . 
  i was just pointing out that schengen membership does not affect the eea-wide freedom of movement . 
   and they are right . 
  they do n't want poland 2.0 . 
  for example uk got over 1mln poles after poland joined freemovement including uk which is pure hypocrisy considering they want to give them refugeess . 
  this is completely irrelevant . 
  uk got so many poles because upon poland joining the eu it was just the uk and sweden that did n't impose any work restrictions . 
  which meant poles could only go to either of those countries to start work immediately . 
  bulgaria and romania waited until january 2014 to gain that right . 
  also , being part of the eu means we ( including them gypsies ) can freely travel between eu countries , they just need to show their id/passport at the border . 
  no restriction . 
  schengen is just about removing those border checks completely , but if 30 million bulgarians and romanians want to move to the uk they can do it right now and the fact that the countries are not part of schengen will not prevent them from doing that . 
  uk is also outside of schengen , but that does n't stop the brits flooding spain , 
  you 're not directly responsible for the arab spring , but definitely helped it develop further . 
  toppling saddam hussein destabilized iraq and allowed for multiple extremist groups to join the fight for power . 
  same story with qaddafi . 
  air strikes definitely helped those groups topple him and now the country is on the verge of collapse . 
  if you had it your way and you removed / helped remove assad from power in syria , now the whole country would have been in the hands of isis . 
  all those may be evil dictators , but they are 100 times better than isis in power . 
  you ca n't forcefully democratize nations . 
  no one asked the people here if they wanted the wars . 
  heck , no one even asked us if we wanted to be part of nato . 
  just because all our ruling `` elite '' are tiny puppets in the hands of dc and brussels , does n't mean we agree with the atrocities committed by your government . 
  also , i should note that i do n't blame the american people of what their governments have done in the past decade . 
  but saying that bulgaria , norway or albania are just as guilty of what 's been happening in the middle east as america is , does n't sound serious . 
  that being said , it 's obvious that nato is incapable of establishing peace in the middle east . 
  if they ca n't they may as well let the russians give it a try , it 's not like the situation can get any worse . 
  after the whole clusterfuck of a mess that the americans stirred up in the middle east , i do n't think they 're in the moral position to ask anything ... 
  all for it . 
  remember the [ good ol' days ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_bulgarian_empire ) ? 
  yep , pretty much all correct . 
  the only mistake was when he mentioned we were part of the soviet union . 
  we were a satellite state , but never part of the union . 
  it 's actually completely true ( from our bulgarian pov ) :d, 
  the collapse of the communist regimes in eastern europe had catastrophic consequences on the economy and welfare of people . 
  recently there was an article that my country ( bulgaria ) had finally reached the average standard of life of that in 1989 ( just before communism fell ) . 
  basically 26 years of one big nothing . 
  a whole generation 's lives wasted . 
  went to a georgian restaurant in london a couple of weeks . 
  dish names were completely unpronounceable , but also absolutely delicious . 
  10/10 would go again . 
  that being said , the only things i know are that you 've got a disputed region with russia which led to a short war a few years ago . 
  oh yeah , and your alphabet is unlike anything i 've ever seen before  greetings from a bulgarian living in the uk, 
  it 's true that ditching our alphabet in favour of the latin one would make quite a lot of things easier for both us and tourists , however cyrillic has been an integral part of our culture for more than 1000 years , and we value that a lot more . 
  i 'm sure the greeks feel the same way about their alphabet . 
  i do n't however think that we need everyone in the eu to learn 3 alphabets just because we and greece do n't use the latin . 
  it 's not likely that 500m people would all definitely visit bg and gr multiple times to need to know the alphabet , and if they ever do , they can learn the alphabet in a few hours , they 're not that difficult . 
  prices are on average 50-60 % higher in greece -  [ url = http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?country1=bulgaria&amp;country2=greece&amp;city1=sofia&amp;city2=athens]link[/url] , however salaries in greece are are 250 % + higher in comparison . 
  insulting people on forums will not pay your debts . 
  and maybe the fact that you have such a high debt is because you have lived well beyond your means for the past decades ? 
  you ca n't sustain a quality of life similar to that of uk or germany with your economy , but instead of living within your means you borrowed hundreds of billions . 
  it 's time to pay the bills . 
  austerity may seem severe , but it 's the only fair solution to the problem . 
  if i ca n't pay back my mortgage the bank would take away my house , not give me more free monies . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_european_countries_by_average_wage average wage in bulgaria : 356 eur ( net ) average wage in greece : 1004 eur ( net ) as a bulgarian i find it extremely difficult to feel sorry for the poor suffering greeks . 
  no disrespect but your current `` hardships '' seem laughable through our eyes . 
  when you owe 200,000 the bank owns you , when you owe 200 bilion you own the bank . 
  completely inadequate and literally counter-productive institutions . 
  the judiciary system is a joke , oligarchs and politicians ( usually the same people ) use the system to opress anyone who tries to go against the status quo . 
  truth is , the country and the people have quite a lot of money in the form of savings , but noone wants to risk and invest it , since in this country you never know what 's gon na happen . 
  all this is stopping investments ( both local and international ) and together with the financial crisis in the eu , the economy has n't moved an inch the past years . 
  it looks like bulgaria has flatlined . 
  rip :d, 
  and do what ? 
  fight for asad against isis ? 
  or fight with isis against asad ? 
  it did n't work out well in iraq . 
   there are plenty of uneducated and/or older bulgarians same in every country around europe , and again it 's those people who are the least tolerant towards both eu and non-eu migrants , including muslims . 
  however , even though the media is all loud and shouting , those people are nevertheless a minority . 
   due to the rising population of muslims , which looks set to overtake non-muslim bulgarians if the trend continues . 
  that 's a trend across all of europe , not just bulgaria . 
  in fact bulgaria is one of the least affected countries . 
  they definitely can coexist . 
  muslim turks and christian bulgarians have coexisted in bulgaria for hundreds of years and definitely bulgarian culture is still here , persevered through the centuries , even though it was close to extinction during the ottoman empire . 
  in modern days i see bulgarians and turkish live together in many cities , study together in universities , the turkish minority even have their own ethnic party in the parliament . 
  i bear no resentment towards my fellow countrymen whether christian or muslim , and the majority of young and well-educated people feel the same . 
  macedonia is n't joining until they settle the name dispute with greece , which is n't going to happen anytime soon ... 
  and if russia invades wales , should we just sit back , relax , and enjoy the show ? 
  bulgaria : - do n't tell them that they might not be 100 % native thracians . 
  this is pure bs . 
  no bulgarian with a little bit of common sense would ever claim that we are thracians ( let alone 100 % ) , lol, 
  mac : so toa bul : sas tova ( \u0441\u044a\u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 ) -  ` tva ' is an informal contraction mac : sekogash bul : vsyakoga ( \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0430 ) ,
