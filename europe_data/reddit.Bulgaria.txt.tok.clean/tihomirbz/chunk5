  british-ness is as much an artificial construct , as european is , yet seems to have worked alright for the uk for the past few centuries . 
  if english and scottish can be in the same union and feel `` british '' , i see no reason why german and spanish ca n't , and feel `` european '' . 
  it 's just another layer . 
  anyway , to answer your question from a bit of a different perspective . 
  i am bulgarian , feel bulgarian , but have lived in the uk for 4 + years now . 
  i do n't feel british or english in anyway , but going back to bulgaria i 'm starting to experience a larger and larger culture shock every time . 
  not british ( yet ) , but also not fully bulgarian as i once was - the only option left for me is indeed european . 
  in or out of the eu , you ca n't stop globalization , and the more peoples mix and interact and live together , the more national identities will fade away . 
  which makes the whole thing even better . 
  nothing like going 100km south and feeling the entirely different culture , language , history , yet part of the same union as you . 
  meanwhile in the us , 100km south and you 've gone from one cornfield to another . 
   i think that the uk should join efta so still free movement of people ? 
  switzerland is in efta , not eea , and they still have full free movement of people , plus they 're part of schengen ( which the uk is not ) . 
  i 'm curious what kind of a deal brexiters ** realistically ** want . 
  free movement of goods / no tariffs is a given , loads of countries have that with the eu , but there will be no access to the services common market with no free movement of people . 
  are people happy to wreck the financial industry in the uk , bringing so much of the uk 's gdp , just so that they get a couple of poles and romanians fewer in the country ? 
  if any ... ? 
  yeah , take that romania !, 
  we finally get to beat ya at some statistic !, 
  1885 never forget . 
  you 've been throwing the middle finger to the eu for decades now , with your constant opt-outs and special treatment request . 
  more recently , the middle finger was aimed directly at the people from southern or ( god forbid ) eastern europe , usually directly by the people you elected . 
  do n't act suprised if the continent is not too happy with you . 
  we did , until we got all the benefits , food vouchers , and free housing from the uk taxpayers . 
  now we live in the penthouses in the shard . 
  just as we are now competing for the same seven available flats in london . 
  which is just a response to the overwhelming anti-eu sentiment in r/ukinreallife, 
  does everyone in macedonia have a bulgarian passport ? 
  seems like every other macedonian i speak to already has one ... 
   are there that many macedonians of bulgarian heritage or is it just anyone from fyrom ? 
  according to bulgaria , all ethnic christian macedonians are of bulgarian heritage historically and thus anyone who wants gets a passport ( at least until recently ) . 
  those who suggest that after imposing restrictions the uk will be just as attractive as before , only it will be able to filter out only those that it wants , which is wrong . 
  restrictions will make the uk a lot less attractive destination to both highly qualified and unqualified workers . 
  you will see drop in polish plumbers or bulgarian cleaners wanting to come , but you will also see a significant drop in doctors , nurses , engineers wanting to come , due to the bureaucratic hell that the country will impose . 
  ok , first , all the links you posted describe the situation a few months ago - when the uk was an eu member , and indeed the economy was doing well . 
  the impact of the brexit however will definitely put an end to that ( or slow it down significantly ) . 
  you assume that the uk 's economy will continue to grow steadily as it used to do in the past months , ignoring the fact that post-brexit loss of investment and possible stagnation will have significantly worse effect on the job market than foreigners taking over locals ' jobs . 
  according to the imf , brexit may cause up to 5.5 % ** decrease ** in the country 's gdp . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/18/imf-says-brexit-would-trigger-uk-recession-eu-referendum ) . 
  i 'm not sure most brexiters realize this - leaving the eu and imposing restrictions on immigration will not magically free up jobs for the locals , there will be ** substantially ** fewer jobs available in the job market . 
  add to that the fact that the uk will not get access to the common market ( whether as member of the eea or not ) , if it imposes any restrictions on immigration , meaning you 'll have to quickly find alternative for your biggest export market ( was it 40 + percent ? ) . 
  finally , the whole process of leaving the eu , and then signing trade agreements with whoever will take years . 
  that 's years of uncertainty , years with little to no investment , and years of stagnating economy in the best case scenario . 
  by that time , the generation will already be lost . 
  and having almost 700,000 fewer jobs available in the market , due to the post-brexit collapse , will definitely help those 600,000 youths . 
  [ relevant ] ( https://twitter.com/jolyonmaugham/status/750618809703292928 ), 
  that 's assuming that such high numbers of eu migrants would still want to come to the uk . 
  people seem to forget that one of the reasons ( among many ) why so many eu migrants want ( ed ) to come to britain was because it was essentially unrestricted - you get on the plane , and you do n't even need a passport , id card was enough , and you 're free to work/study/whatever freely . 
  if visas / restrictions / points-based bureaucratic hell is introduced , most people would simply not bother . 
  if i can go to germany or netherlands freely , why bother going through all that to go especially to the uk ? 
  if i 'll have to wait months and fill tons of paperwork to get a work permit , i may as well apply to a country that 's actually worth the trouble ( e.g. 
  uk is not as special as many locals think , and if restrictions are applied it will become even less attractive , especially to those high-skilled workers you seem to still want . 
  technically , most of eastern europe , including bulgaria and romania , is still considered `` developing '' , as opposed to the `` developed '' western europe / north america / etc. 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/developing_country ) now , obviously you ca n't compare ee to ( most of ) africa or asia , overall the whole continent is more developed . 
  but still , there 's a very long way to go until ee can be considered on par with we . 
  [ unemployment levels across the eu ] ( http://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/ ) unemployment is roughly the same in ** most ** eu countries , it 's only when you get to france , the pigs , and a couple of other countries is where it gets noticeably higher . 
  people come to the uk for multiple reasons , not just lower unemploument rate / high wages . 
  they can get that from about 15 other eu countries . 
  english language has been by far the biggest attraction to the uk , as well as no red tape / restrictions . 
  add working visas , and most people simply would n't be bothered anymore , if i 'm gon na try and emigrate to a place which requires visas/permits , i may as well go to a country that 's worth going through the bureaucratic hell to . 
  uk definitely wo n't be top choice , especially for highly qualified people . 
  but we will at some point in the future ( maybe possibly ) . 
  kind of . 
  some hate russia ( e.g. 
  poland , the baltics ) , some love them ( serbia , belarus ) , and then you have countries with apparent schizophrenia where part of the population hates them and the other part loves them ( e.g. 
  bulgaria ) . 
   and ee is getting more than we got from the marshall plan and still i see the demand for yet more continously . 
  and demand will continue until the standards in both sides even out ( more or less ) . 
  you ca n't expect to be part of a union with so much freedoms between the countries , for people to be free to do essentially everything , and with such huge economic disparity . 
  it 's normal within a single country richer regions to provide economic assistance to the poorer ones , and that 's exactly what 's happening on an eu level . 
   the way i see it these things are not really connected to the eu though . 
  the eu did not force ee to privatize their state companies . 
  also a number of these happened before the ascension to the eu . 
  let me just say that i 'm not saying that the privatization was bad . 
  it was going to happen one way or another due to the transition to market economy . 
  i 'm just pointing out how much western europe profited from the privatizations in the east , something which people often forget when they start talking about how much money ee gets from the eu . 
   migration of bright people is also something that happens . 
  some of the brightest people here go to the us . 
  granted the eu makes it easier to move to western europe . 
  indeed , again i 'm not saying this as a bad thing , just stating the fact . 
  and yes , there was migration before the eu accession , but never on such massive scale . 
   as for a sum you are looking at $ 2 trillion and another 100 billion annually . 
  i think that spending was justified . 
  that was another part of germany a part of the same state . 
  why should western europe feel the same obligation as west germany felt to its brother in the east ? 
  you mentioned that the west wanted further integration , opposed by the east . 
  well there you have it - to have further integration , you will also have to support the poorer regions , the same way richer regions in germany support the poorer . 
  after all , we 're all part of the same union , right ? 
  i do n't think federal europe would ever happen , but if it does , what do you think should happen to west 's funding towards the east ? 
   the thing is should i really want `` allies '' though that mostly give demands while giving nothing back only pointing out that they are still poorer when it comes to participating in common tasks ? 
  think of the reaction of ee during the refugee crisis for example . 
  with the exception of the migrant crisis , i think the east has been integrating quite well . 
  most of the ee countries now either use the euro , or are on the path to adopting it . 
  same thing can not be said about every we country , think of denmark or the uk . 
  you mentioned that the east does n't want to support common tasks - then what do you think of the uk ? 
  with all their opt-outs and demands for special treatment , do you consider the uk a better ally than , say czech republic ? 
  if yes , is that just because the uk is bigger/stronger or do you genuinely believe they want the eu to succeed more than poland , czech republic , hungary ? 
  about the refugee crisis - it 's a more compex issue . 
  firstly people were accepting this as a normal thing due to the war , until merkel decided to publicly invite everyone to come to europe on her own , without any consultation with either the other countries or the eu itself . 
  look at the problems that greece and italy are facing due to the migrant crisis , are they less of an ally , even though they 're not from ee ?
