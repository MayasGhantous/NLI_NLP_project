we do n't have any hah , how pathetic . 
  we have a whole 80 tanks ... ... except they ca n't start because they do n't have accumulators ... 
   russian nazi shit -  working for fascist regime is a bit fucked up . 
  so much poison in one post and i 'm not even bugged anymore . 
  so , why the hell is norway having naval drills in the arctic with this `` fascist regime '' that you 're so angry at ? 
  i do n't know about you , but `` strong nato presence '' and `` strong poland '' seem mutually exclusive to me . 
  that 's just rooshun propaganda !, 
  would you care to explain yourself why you think that ? 
   accusing me of making up shit it 's kind of funny when you look at the rest of this thread and any other russia-related thread . 
  what `` what '' ? 
  did `` the secret tunnel to kill latvian babies '' sound too ridiculous , paranoid and out of this world ? 
  maybe . 
  i just tried to interpret whatever your media is probably blasting at you 24/7 ... 
   http://i.imgur.com/zveoj.jpg that 's you , right ? 
  because you still have n't told me all the stories about how russia is secretly building underground tunnels to kill latvian babies under everybody 's noses ... 
  please , by all means , tell me all about how russia is about to blitzkrieg all over poor little latvia , any moment now ... 
  and this just 9 hours after everyone made fun of the russian paranoia of a us invasion . 
  both are equally ridiculous ... 
  yeah , i wish ... 
  i 'd vote for farage and korwin-mikke if i could ... 
  why is it that whenever ** i ** link to wikipedia , i get laughed at ? 
  did n't read it correctly , i guess . 
  still , i 'm going to need some evidence of them being funded by the government , otherwise this is just stupid speculation like putin 's ~ ~ 20 ~ ~ ~ ~ 40 ~ ~ 70 billion dollars personal wealth . 
  and please , no `` proofs '' memes . 
  i 'm asking seriously . 
   they 're not a random biker group , they are funded by putin 's administration to act like a pr machine for the kremlin . 
  founded by putin 's administration in 1989 ? 
  and you honestly believe that the eu will magically lay down pipelines to iran and other places in the next 5 years , making gazprom agree to whatever stupid policy this `` energy union '' has in mind ? 
  yeah , call me when that happens ... 
  you 're free to believe that , i guess ... 
   disappearance of those who do n't submit and and actions done to discourage people from not submitting , how would you call it ? 
  that 's not terror , it 's oppression , two very different things . 
   you are still conveniently ignoring the fact that your statement regarding the ussr -  is wrong even by the standards of the current russian government and that says a lot about how wrong you are . 
  i 'm not `` conveniently '' ignoring anything . 
  are you telling me that there was n't a forced collectivization and everyone who disagreed with it was `` dealt '' with ? 
  because that 's basically what i said and you say that it 's wrong ... 
   yeah , i 'm sure that will cause erdogan to suddenly start hating transit money . 
  very funny , but you probably have no idea how deep that guy is lost in his neo-ottomanism fantasies ... 
  please , do n't be so naive as to think that russia would agree to one price for the whole eu . 
  there is just no way for that to happen , unless a second yeltsin comes to power or something . 
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/persian_pipeline -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nabucco_pipeline well , i wish them luck with those , especially with the second one . 
  i do n't think putting a dent in erdogan the magnificent 's ego with the armenian genocide declaration is going to win them any favors , so it 's just wishful thinking at best . 
   currently i am slightly confused regarding your perception of life in a totalitarian state ruled by terror totalitarian states do n't rule by terror , they rule with tight control over every aspect of life . 
  terror is what happened in katyn , volhynia and so on . 
   so i guess what you are implying is that all the people who were killed by ussr were such hardcore capitalists that they went into their death , just to preserve their property or are you saying that they deserved to die ? 
  -  you seem to think that terror exercised by the state is somehow lawful and reasonable . 
  i do n't think i want to continue this dialogue if i am going to have such outrageous words put into my mouth . 
  alright , but where will this union get gas from besides russia ? 
  i can make a `` union '' with my neighbor , but that is n't going to make cash start raining from the sky ... 
  well , something did change , actually . 
  communism divides by class , so you have your wealth and land collectivized and have your life threatened if you refuse . 
  nazism divides by race , and no matter how hard you try , you can not stop being an untermensch , and we all know what happens with the untermenschen ... 
   czech good one , but a link to the source is right there in the article . 
  [ here it is . 
  but they did . 
  it 's literally the second word in my comment . 
  when you say that you melt a piece of ice and then freeze the water again , you do n't just skip the first part ( melting it ) . 
  they liberated eastern and central europe from nazism but imposed communism on them later . 
  they defeated most of the german army - a very big part of it was crushed in the eastern front . 
  also , it was n't just `` the russians '' - there were many big nationalities ( at least 10 ) in the ukrainian fronts , for example . 
  any more questions ? 
   if you want to understand russia 's foreign policy , read fp april 1st was 28 days ago . 
  historical revisionism at its finest . 
  where do you people come from ? 
  oh , wait , this is reddit . 
  moving on ... 
  `` overland '' supply route ? 
  what is the retard who wrote this article smoking ? 
  are we just going to pretend that there are n't [ two more ] ( http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/ukraine/images/map-ukraine-regions.jpg ) regions between donetsk and crimea ? 
  not just this one comment . 
  i looked at your recent comment history - that 's why i think you 're just messing with my head . 
  man , i do n't know . 
  i find it hard to believe to find a pole like you , especially on reddit , of all places ... 
  are you a real pole ? 
   what made you ask ? 
  most of the the '' \u0431\u0435\u043b-\u0447\u044b\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043d\u0430-\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044b '' folks i 've talked with are really , how do i say , `` aggressive '' on the subject of anything soviet-related , so i have probably worked up a prejudice of some kind . 
  i noticed that your username was `` dontjustassume '' , but i decided to ask anyway ... 
  i noticed your flag and i wanted to ask you a question . 
  now , it may come off as a little aggressive , but would you ban victory day in belarus if it was up to you ? 
  limit immigration . 
  severely . 
  there , i said it . 
  i am ready for whatever is to come . 
  finally , something good to come out of that brothel . 
  five yuans . 
  what about you ? 
  aw , what a cute way to deal with your complexes , although it 's not the first time i see a pathetic , sad little person wishing instability to other countries . 
  big deal . 
  a serbian visit to moscow for victory day does n't generate nearly as much butthurt as the czech president 's visit . 
   ... and you guys make the people responsible for the massacre national heroes ... it just hurts . 
  well , they tried doing that in 2010 , i think , but it was met with harsh reactions from russian , polish and jewish organizations and communities and had to go back on it . 
  who knows , maybe they 'll try it again , amidst today 's geopolitical tensions , considering poroshenko 's pr team really likes screwing him over like it 's a fucking sport or something ... 
  tell me , what do ukrainian history books say about the massacres of poles in volhynia and eastern galicia ? 
   you made a deal with hitler [ ahem ... ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/german%e2%80%93polish_non-aggression_pact ), 
   you write such nonsense good to know that i 'll fit right in . 
  * `` if you do n't give your kid the anti-kurwa vaccine , there will be consequences !, 
  well , i 'd give my perspective , which is unimaginably different from yours , but i would n't want to have my inbox flooded by some types calling me `` stupid '' , `` archaic '' , `` romantic '' , or worse - that i want putin to dominate me ... 
   we can actually see your post history , you know that , right ? 
  of course i know you can . 
  now everyone can see my calls for russian tanks and communism to come back .
