i thought the joke was that the op link is bbc ? 
  i do n't have an answer for your question , but i really think you should n't be downvoted for asking it . 
  this is either a brilliant sarcastic remark or i do n't know . 
  let me introduce you to that little weird thing called ` edl ', 
  it will depend on which side of the iron curtain you were . 
  for people living in eastern europe it 's a memorable experience . 
  oh , where do i even begin , probably queueing . . queuing for everything . 
  supermarkets with empty shelves and huge queues when they finally stock on something useful - and i mean , basic stuff like bread , fruits , meat . 
  needing a permit to live in a city and everyone hoping and trying to obtain one for the capital . 
  being careful with your tv antenna , if it 's too big , you might be able to tune into the serbian tv , which was much more entertaining for everyone , but that the secret police will make you a suspect , because you could also be tuning to bbc and other dangerous western influence . 
  oranges , only in the end of december , again - huge queues for them , people queueing for hours , planting family members in different locations of the queue so they can get more than just one batch . 
  and then a neighbour recognizes you and there is a big scandal how you 're trying to cheat the system and get more than you deserve . 
  waiting for years for a car , wait no , for a permit to buy a car . 
  the truck drivers that were one of the few travelling abroad and bringing western made things in the country and how everyone envied them . 
  the medical staff that was working in lebanon , together with the truck drivers were the small portion of the population that had us dollars ( or any other western currency ) - and they would take you to the only store that was working with foreign currency , which you were n't usually allowed in . 
  they had kindersurprise - the chocolate eggs with a toy inside , probably the most valuable thing you could have as a kid . 
  i can probably go on for pages and pages . 
  on par - our former internal minister , who proposed a ` mandatory registration of criminals or people under investigation ' declined to sign the documents and tried to battle them in european court , when he was himself under investigation couple of months later . 
  oh man , it 's amazing , i 've seen it here in bulgaria , saw it in the media war before the real war in ukraine , same in turkey and romania ( the rosia montana protests ) . 
  always , without exception , the same rhetoric , same actions . 
  it 's not even funny anymore . 
  taxes or bribes ? 
  you know , they sometimes get confused by oficials ... 
  who is the government blaming for staging the protests and paying the protesters ? 
  a ) usa b ) soros c ) eu funds . . something second question , has there been already counter-protests , supporting the tax ? 
  just making sure that hungary are following the guidelines on how to deal with street unrest . 
  haha , this is brilliant , 
  p ** love ** div on 6th , well done \u043c\u0430\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 , well done . 
  because reasons !, 
  during the bulgarian protests last year , one of the government most loud supporters said literally `` self-organisation is impossible , of course they 're orchestrated by the jews '' . 
  this is awesome !, 
  i really think the right to die with dignity should be in the constitution . 
  the widely used police car in bulgaria is an old opel astra . 
  that cayenne thing might be a confiscated car put in use , but there are 1 or 2 of them , no more . 
  a year too late . 
  they 're eurogay !, 
  ( yes , i 'm not kidding , they 're using that word ), 
  why are the germans so affraid of nuclear power ? 
  they 're winning exactly where they want to - bulgaria for example , unfortunately . 
  a modern , post-erdogan turkey would be great for the eu , but you know that already . 
  i 'll accept the bucharest remark , the same way that sofia is much different to the rest of the country, 
  fyi : you 're being downvoted because you are right . 
  casual racism and discrimanation is quite common in bulgaria and the eastern european countries in general . 
  gypsy numbers seemed like something worth mentioning , really ? 
  haha  ) this is brilliant, 
   sic and vis recently have been replaced by other organizations and banks , but yeah , you 're right , the mafia is part of the fabric of the country and is running things . 
  i 'm sorry to spoil it for you , but sofia is nothing like the rest of the country . 
  those peaceful protests ? 
  they accomplished nothing , because the rest of the country did n't join , did n't feel represented at them at all . 
  sofia is beautiful thou , think you might enjoy this : http://vimeo.com/92939175, 
  your observation is spot on . 
  we 've been telling ourselves all these lies to make us feel better , some have actually started to believe them . 
  been to romania 2 times , once with a train once with a car . 
  once in bucharest , once in cluj . 
  the countryside - seems to be doing better than bulgaria . 
  southern romania and northern bulgaria ca n't be really told apart . 
  they are the same , same kind of people , same kind of problems . 
  my personal opinion , you 're doing way better then we are . 
  we have layers upon layers upon layers of corruption mate , you have no chance to catchup . 
  probably not . 
  most people that do n't follow the region will not understand the importance of that . 
  yep . 
  what most of us are saying right now . 
  yeah , that one is priceless . 
  the toilet rolls were used as a ` shield ' by a guy . 
  they confiscated them , no idea why and even threatened to arrest him , 
  bench was part of a barricade , to block off the street . 
  passive support for the protests has been measured between 80 % and 60 % by different research agencies ( even the pro-government ones , one of them run by the brother of the socialist party leader ca n't twist it to less then 60 % ) . 
   it 's essential that there are many protesters . 
  true . 
  also hard to happen after 5 months of protests and zero visible result . 
  the leader of bsp ( whos government we 're protesting against ) is also the leader of pes ( the european socialists party ) . 
  he is in coalition with a neo-nazi party ( called ` attack ' ) and probably many european left oriented people would n't be happy with such person leading their party . 
  so we 're hoping on internal pressure ( from us ) and outside pressure from the european union . 
  that 's why we need more people exposed to the news . 
  more info on the students protests , if someone is interested on : | | [ twitter #occupysu ] ( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23occupysu ) | | [ facebook #occupysu ] ( https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/occupysu ) | | *** | | [ twitter #\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441withme ] ( https://twitter.com/search?q=%23\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441withme ) | | [ facebook #\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441withme ] ( https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441withme ) | | *** [ al jazeera story ] ( http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201310281911-0023148 ) and [ euronews story ] ( http://www.euronews.com/2013/10/28/in-bulgaria-students-join-anti-government-protests-occupy-university-buildings/ ), 
  not at all . 
  that 's one of the main points of opponents of the ban : anyone , not just eu citizens can register a company and buy that land regardless . 
  we 're not up to the standards because of corruption on all government levels , most of them sucking on the eu funds that are supposed to help us raise our agriculture to a higher level . 
  do n't see how that would change anything . 
  most probably it will be overruled in the constitutional court , all parties involved will scream ` we wanted to , but see , big bad europe is forcing us to do it ' - supposedly keeping face for their retarded voters and nothing will change . 
  for a country that is trying ( supposedly ) very hard to get accepted in the schengen zone , yeah , it 's catastrophic . 
  it 's also against the eu contract we signed when joining , so either we 're in breach of the contract , therefore will need to pay huge penalties , or we need to arrange modification of the contract with each of the other 27 countries of the eu . 
  the supposedly pro-eu party voted against the eu law , the mafia party voted for it . 
  it 's just so ridiculous , so unbelievably ridiculous . 
  well , it does n't really help us very much , in terms of achieving our goals , but it does give me a nice feeling of satisfaction :-), 
  just it found it myself , but thanks for looking !, 
  do you have some twitter/facebook hashtag in use for the protests ? 
  now , where might have i seen this ? 
  hmm , did our mafia guys started exporting propaganda ideas ? 
  same here ( about the legality ) , but there were just too many people to even think of dispersing them with police force , so instead the police just guards the route of the protest . 
  peaceful is good . 
  keep it up !, 
  you have the full support of the #\u0414\u0410\u041d\u0421withme movement !, 
  good luck neighbors , i hope your protests are more successful than ours !, 
  for awhile , the / r/europe subreddit was pretty much flooded with posts about the protests ( reaching 5-6 per day ) and people just got tired of it . 
  the obvious lack of anything significant happening as we approach day 100 of the protests also does n't help . 
  ... because he could n't run for president, 
  shutup putin, 
  funny you should say that , we 've discussed it today at the rally .
