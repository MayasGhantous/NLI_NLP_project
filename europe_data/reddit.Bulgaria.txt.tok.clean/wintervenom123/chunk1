if you think that they did on behalf of their good will then you are deranged . 
  i 'm not saying other countries are different on the contrary i think pragmatism is a vital part of politics , i just dislike the facade that comes with it . 
   additional factors included russian hopes of recovering territorial losses suffered during the crimean war , re-establishing itself in the black sea , and supporting the political movement attempting to free balkan nations from the ottoman empire . 
   as a result of the war , russia succeeded in claiming several provinces in the caucasus , namely kars and batumi .

  young bulgarians do n't like communism !, 
  old people are the only ones who think that it was better before . 
  why insult character to prove a point . 
  you seem to have an agenda to expose agendas , do you hate yourself or are you excused ? 
  you have given only vague answers as if your opinion should be standard common sense . 
  the decision your democratically elected leaders make have consequences . 
  you said : and face ostracising from all of the european community ? 
  yeah right . 
  you do n't represent r/europe , you did n't answer the question and you seem to be hating on people who do not share the same opinion as you , how are you that which makes europe great , truth is you 're probably a bigger danger to eu values than any war refugees . 
  but are we threating them as humans should threat other humans . 
  well yes . 
  you have the right to an opinion but that does n't excuse from the consequences of that opinion,

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_greece yeah its all someone else 's fault . 
  also when a new government is elected it stops all projects from previous governments , then they get kicked out and the cycle repeats that way nothing gets done . 
  this one is my favourite  if you do n't want to become a minority in your own native kand you 're a racist . 
  soon it will be , `` who cares if your race/ethnic group goes extinct . 
  we are all people . '', 
   utter insanity , really . 
  i always thought people created because they wanted to share and got a kick out of creating , surely more people seeing your stuff is good for you and for business , more people will be talking to it more potential buyers . 
  you seem to have answered a different question , he did not ask should we use rebel groups to further our goals , he asked should we consider isis a state based on your view of western ideals . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/straw_man 1 . person 1 asserts proposition x. 
  2 . person 2 argues against superficially similar proposition y , falsely , as if an argument against y were an argument against x. edit : also your western values argument is just circular logic . 
  you proof something with something that requires proof by itself . 
  bombings have ? 
  airport security ? 
  extreme reactions to extreme actions is not helping . 
  what about 9/11 that worked great did n't it ? 
  actually by looking at why he made that statement , was against government snooping on peoples mail , we can kinda presume what kind of freedom he was talking about . 
  also its more of a problem of people taking the things said too literally or purposely misinterpreting them to suite their agenda . 
  no i was just addressing that both of em were just throwing claims with no backup . 
  obviously we have nukes , over 3000 planes , tanks , kinetics weapons etc . 
  just a simple source or graph for backup on either position would be nice . 
  not in a society where moral values are seen as the highest virtue and state education provides meaningful intellectual discussion that leads to a peaceful way of thinking instead of just pouring ideologies down kids throats . 
  you had a bombing last year . 
  we as a society are against any kind of extremism , you are advocating extremism with your post , clearly you are not a friend to our main values like liberty of thoughts , freedom of movement and in general higher moral values . 
  why should i join you and let the terrorist win . 
  you could have all the police in the world and it would still not stop the attacks . 
  no terror attacks have been prevented by extra airport security , more control is obviously not gon na solve this . 
  i do n't want soldiers on my street . 
  i am not prepared to sacrifice my freedom for extra false sense of security . 
  these terrorists were born in paris how the fuck is curbing immigration gon na affect this ? 
  fuck you for using a crysis to get more people into your way of thinking . 
  that 's isis tactics . 
  so just nuke the shit out of em ? 
  just kill civilians and destroy their houses with bombs , how is that not terror ? 
  you 're worse , way more fucked in the head than these terrorists are . 
  you not only want genocide , you want an army to do it for you as you watch and give orders from the side , you sociopath . 
  why do n't you join the army , then see how you fare in the field as you kill children in this `` do n't give shit about collateral damage '' world of yours . 
  fucking inconsiderate , hate proclaiming , useless dick . 
  claims with no backing from both sides . 
   the status of abkhazia is a central issue of the georgian -- abkhazian conflict . 
  the wider region formed part of the soviet union until 1991 . 
  as the soviet union began to disintegrate towards the end of the 1980s , ethnic tensions grew between the abkhaz and georgians over georgia 's moves towards independence . 
  this led to the 1992 -- 1993 war in abkhazia that resulted in a georgian military defeat , de facto independence of abkhazia and the mass exodus and ethnic cleansing of the georgian population from abkhazia . 
  in spite of the 1994 ceasefire agreement and years of negotiations , the status dispute has not been resolved , and despite the long-term presence of a united nations monitoring force and a commonwealth of independent states ( cis ) peacekeeping operation , the conflict has flared up on several occasions . 
  in august 2008 , the sides again fought during the south ossetia war , which was followed by the formal recognition of abkhazia by russia , the annulment of the 1994 ceasefire agreement and the termination of the un and osce missions . 
  [ 18 ] [ 19 ] on 28 august 2008 , the parliament of georgia passed a resolution declaring abkhazia a russian-occupied territory . 
  [ 20 ] [ 21 ] a major part of international community considers abkhazia to be occupied by the russian military . 
  [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] russia does not allow the european union monitoring mission ( eumm ) to enter abkhazia . 
  moving troops in its own territory isnt that the story of the yugoslav wars ? 
  quite similar but how is arming rebels , purposely increasing tensions and destroying relation considered ok by russia then , if you find similarities would n't deescalation be the right way to go about it aka not what we 're doing now . 
  also the point of the argument is that its a technicality just like yours . 
   the nation of yugoslavia was created in the aftermath of world war i , and was composed mostly of south slavic christians , but the nation also had a substantial muslim minority . 
  this nation lasted from 1918 to 1941 , when it was invaded by axis powers during world war ii , which provided support to the usta\u0161e ( founded 1929 ) , which conducted a genocidal campaign against serbs , jews and roma inside its territory . 
  in 1943 , the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia ( sfry ) was established under josip broz tito , who maintained a strongly authoritarian leadership that was non-aligned with either the united states or the soviet union during the cold war . 
  [ citation needed ]  in the 1980s , relations among the six republics of the sfry deteriorated . 
  slovenia and croatia desired greater autonomy within the yugoslav confederation , while serbia sought to strengthen federal authority . 
  as it became clearer that there was no solution agreeable to all parties , slovenia and croatia moved toward secession . 
  although tensions in yugoslavia had been mounting since the early 1980s , it was 1990 that proved decisive . 
  in the midst of economic hardship , yugoslavia was facing rising nationalism among its various ethnic groups .
