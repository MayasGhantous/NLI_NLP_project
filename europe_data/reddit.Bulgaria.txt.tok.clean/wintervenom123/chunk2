  by the early 1990s , there was no effective authority at the federal level . 
  the federal presidency consisted of the representatives of the six republics , two provinces , and the yugoslav people 's army ( jna ) . 
  the communist leadership was divided along national lines . 
   the representatives of vojvodina , kosovo and montenegro were replaced with loyalists of the president of serbia , slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 . 
  serbia secured four out of eight federal presidency votes [ 17 ] and was able to heavily influence decision-making at the federal level , since all the other yugoslav republics only had one vote . 
  while slovenia and croatia wanted to allow a multi-party system , serbia , led by milo\u0161evi\u0107 , demanded an even more centralized federation and serbia 's dominant role in it . 
  [ 18 ] at the 14th extraordinary congress of the league of communists of yugoslavia in january 1990 , the serbian-dominated assembly agreed to abolish the single-party system ; however , slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 , the head of the serbian party branch ( league of communists of serbia ) used his influence to block and vote-down all other proposals from the croatian and slovene party delegates . 
  this prompted the croatian and slovene delegations to walk out and thus the break-up of the party , [ 19 ] a symbolic event representing the end of `` brotherhood and unity '' . 
   upon croatia and slovenia declaring independence in 1991 , the yugoslav federal government attempted to forcibly halt the impending breakup of the country , with yugoslav prime minister ante markovi\u0107 declaring the secessions of slovenia and croatia to be illegal and contrary to the constitution of yugoslavia , and declared support for the yugoslav people 's army to secure the integral unity of yugoslavia . 
  yeah but if you 're gon na be a dick about it , then georgia was technically moving troops in its own territory so it did n't invade anybody . 
  again what was russia doing in an internal matters conflict , if the people of a province want to separate they should do it through a legislative process . 
  well do n't agree with you here . 
  the house of lords is the second chamber of the uk parliament so the opinion of one of its members actually does matter and does reflect on where the government stands . 
  role and work of the house of lords what does the house of lords do ? 
  the house of lords is the second chamber of the uk parliament . 
  it works with the house of commons to : make laws check and challenge the actions of the government , and provide a forum of independent expertise the house of lords chamber spends about 60 % of its time on legislation ; the other 40 % is spent on scrutiny -- questioning government and debating issues and policy . 
  committee work takes place outside the chamber . 
  how does the house of lords relate to parliament and government ? 
  the house of lords is often referred to as the ` upper house ' or ` second chamber ' . 
  both these terms illustrate that the lords is one of two parts of the uk parliament . 
  the political party which wins the most seats/places in a general election forms the government . 
  the government runs the country and is formed from the political party that wins most seats in the house of commons in a general election . 
  the government formulates policy and introduces legislation in parliament . 
  most senior members of the government are members of the house of commons but there are ministers , along with two cabinet members , in the house of lords . 
  the house of lords also contains many members of parliament who were in previous governments . 
  ** bullshit ** [ the comment ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=34&amp;v=q8pkbui6ipe ) the interviewer asked him what 's the plan on a free trade deal if the eu is not onboard with gibraltar being a part of that deal ( because its a freaking tax haven ) . 
  he responded with a xenophobic comment followed by some major bullshit ( even greater than yours ) of how they would send troops . 
  nowhere has spain said they will invade and god damn if we do n't want gibraltar to be part of the deal , sending troops on the island is n't gon na change our minds , its a stupid pointless response of a really pathetic man . 
   then you need to be mad at the journalist who brought up the hypothetical , and those who keep asking about it , not at the uk , the government or anyone else . 
  that said , your thesis that hypotheticals are n't comparable to identical hypotheticals is absolutely insane .

  also you have no understanding how the house of lords work , so shut the fuck up with your stupid goal post moving point that you keep repeating in this thread .

  mate i 've been looking at this thread and it seems that most people are telling you exactly that but you 're kinda not seeing it . 
  yes they know that 's not the uk government 's position ( the comment from the lord ) but one of the members from the house of lords ( which has a say about a lot of issues in the uk government ) made a stupid useless comment . 
  what the uk government should have said is . '', 
  yes if our territory or sovereignty is under attack we will respond but this is not the case here . '', 
  the whole point of this thread is that the lord-dude took the question in a stupid way . 
  spain will not and does not want to invade , so its not the same what if scenario . 
  yes if poland was attacking a fellow nato member every other nato member will go to war with them . 
  but this is a guy being asked about the economic future of an island and he responds with '' we 've dealt with other spanish speaking countries ( quite the xenophobic comment when you think about it , i mean saying spain argentina what 's the difference is an ignorant a comment as you can get ) who have disputed our overseas territory '' . 
  did one of spain 's government representatives state that they would use force to get the island ? 
  then what the fuck is up with that comment . 
  and sorry but no , this argument you give that any country should react the same way is cold era stupid . 
  eu member states are more than just friendly countries , we are economical , cultural and military allies , you can assume non aggression and willingness to talk . 
  it has had 39 crashesh in its 50 year history and while thats worse than the a320 it 's not some kind of mechanical death trap . 
  mate stop screaming an argument you heard other people use.you did not actually present any arguments to build straw mans around . 
  you made an anecdote , a barely coherent sentence about me equating 2 acts as terrorist , another useless statement where everyone with a brain thinks like you , and trying to insult . 
  you actually said nothing of substance and actually portrait my views in a extreme way much like a strawman argument . 
   much more than any terrorist attack has achieved recently . 
  short memory much or are you really comparing burning cars with killing people ? 
  this is taking my sentance , transforming it to sound like im equating the two , assuming that only bombings are acts of terrorism , and then burning it making it sound like you defeated my argument . 
  * this is a strawman *  fucking people thinking they need to sleep at night . 
  helicopters and planes flying throughout the night are happening for over two weeks now of course it is annoying . 
  you make it sound like they do it all night while it 's for a few different hours but not after 12 at night . 
  i 've offered an anecdote , countering your anecdote . 
   first you say people are whining without cause and are all stupid and now you argue that the protest the last few days are comparable to bombing and truck attacks ? 
  you are even arguing with yourself . 
  those are 2 separate statements that do not pose a contradiction to themselves . 
  are you 5 ? 
   everyone with a brain knew people would n't just chill . 
   so that makes blowing up cars 100 % justified . 
   stop building straw-mans . 
  so then why are you saying that nobody would be chill if you do n't think it makes their actions justifiable ? 
  do you just say sentences for no reason at all ? 
  to me it 's obvious you 're kinda begging the question . 
  maybe chose your words to be more cohesive  terrorism is a term used in its broadest sense to describe the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror or fear , in order to achieve a political , religious or ideological aim . 
  [ 1 ] it is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence against civilians or non-combatants source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrorism#types  civil disorder -- a form of collective violence interfering with the peace , security , and normal functioning of the community . 
   political terrorism -- violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community , or substantial segment of it , for political purposes . 
   limited political terrorism -- genuine political terrorism is characterized by a revolutionary approach ; limited political terrorism refers to `` acts of terrorism which are committed for ideological or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the state . '', 
  so by this definition what the protesters are doing is terrorism . 
  you are a hypocrite mate . 
  which makes the inconvenience argument even weaker . 
  what 's your point ? 
  hearing helicopters at night = = inconvenience . 
  burning cars , closing transport , making the city center unsafe = = major disruption of day to day life . 
  as a person living here the protests has caused a hugely disproportional disruption in day to day activities than anything that was done by police or security . 
  the only obvious disruption was helicopters making trial runs a few hours every night , the protests have closed down the entire town and burned thru entire neighborhoods worth of cars . 
  sometimes life give you an inconvenience it 's not the adult thing to have a tantrum that results in more damage than a terrorist attack, 
   fucking people thinking they need to sleep at night . 
  helicopters and planes flying throughout the night are happening for over two weeks now of course it is annoying . 
  it 's a minor inconvenience , we have no double glazing and i can sleep just fine . 
   short memory much or are you really comparing burning cars with killing people ? 
  i 'm comparing damage and disruption to civilian lives . 
  and hell a few people have now died , so yes i 'm comparing these clearly violent protest to terrorist acts . 
   not in a tightly build city like hamburg and especially not right next to a known left-scene stronghold . 
  hamburg was actually chosen because it had the needed infrastructure , which ever big town they chose was going to bitch about this , sorry but this is typical not in my backyard mentality . 
   everyone with a brain knew people would n't just chill . 
  so that makes blowing up cars 100 % justified . 
  you sound like a spoiled brat screaming muh helicopter sound . 
  well the arguments are shit , there 's one post saying `` we ca n't afford it '' , `` we hate xyz leader '' , `` hamburg is big '' , the you have just people saying it 's an anarchist group , which is not exactly an argument . 
  so yes i actually do think these people are stupid , the same way i think astrology people are stupid even though they have shitty arguments . 
  i do n't have to give someone courtesy just because they have a argument and we live in a democracy .
