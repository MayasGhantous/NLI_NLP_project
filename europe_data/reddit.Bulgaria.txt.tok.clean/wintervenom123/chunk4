  you trying to make your subjective choice in to law is wrong and removes the whole point of this being a subjective decision . 
  you are making a question in to an assertion . 
  same thing with weed laws . 
  you have the right to not take drugs , you do not have the right to remove my choice on whether i should take drugs . 
  or as a brit my put it : fack off and let me be ya facking caaaant, 
  some people do n't agree on vaccines and would love to stop government using their tax money on it . 
  fortunately objectivity and overall societal benefits  subjective feelings . 
  you may have moral obligations to war but your tax money still goes to maintaining military . 
  what if the fetus wants to die ? 
  is n't it a great moral issue that we were not asked whether we wanted to live in the first place ? 
  fetuses have no rights as they hold no passport or citizenship . 
  women depending on citizenship have a right to [ bodily integrity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bodily_integrity ) . 
   usually , citizenship is inherited . 
  very few countries actually practice location-based citizenship . 
  so my mum is german , my dad is british , i was born in austria but we currently reside in italy . 
  what am i ? 
  do i inherit my german or my british citizenship , do i gain an austrian citizenship as in the moment moment of my birth the only sovereign state available to issue identification documents is austrian . 
  or because every other moment of my life i 've been apart of the italian state , meaning that my education , livelihood , social identity and culture are owed to it , so should my citizenship resign there . 
  was i german or british before i was born , if abortion is illegal in one state , i travel to another to get an abortion , does the second state comply with the first because it has different rules or are we subject to the rules of the land . 
  even if citizenship is given to fetuses ( which it currently isnt cause you have no birth certificate or document giving you citizenship ) there is no right to life . 
   no , it has not . 
  there are new oaths who have been `` inspired '' by it . 
  the ban on abortions still is valid in the hippocratic oath ( which also forbid , for instance , surgery ) . 
  you missed my point entirely . 
  what i mean is that the oath is just a piece of paper ( text whatever ) and it has no divine moral value , not swearing by it , not following it has no consequence . 
  it has no authority as it has not stopped medical malpractice or atrocities from happening nor is it legally binding so that it can be used in such a manner . 
   there is a difference between prohibiting something and allowing something . 
  this makes no sense . 
  are you proposing doctors should use a whitelist instead of a blacklist for medical practices ? 
  that sounds very authoritarian to me . 
   but even the old hippocratic oath mentioned not performing abortions . 
  that 's just retarded i can as easily say that the new ones do not . 
  as of 1993 , only 14 percent of medical oaths prohibited euthanasia , and only 8 percent prohibited abortion . 
  source : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hippocratic_oath as for your other argument , i do not think there is a human right to live . 
  see this post : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lh1ck/wales_and_scotland_offer_free_abortions_to_women/djug15q/, 
   now this is a thin board . 
  it 's not since you gain citizenship in the place you are born , not the place you reside . 
   i am strictly talking medical ethics here ( the thing mostly defined by the hippocratic oath , which expressibly forbids abortions ) . 
  wtf are you on about ? 
  the oath has changed over the past 2000 years it has been around , it 's not some magic text that whispers the true path for a physician , it 's something we decide and treating it as a divine code is just weird , to me . 
  ** as of 1993 , only 14 percent of medical oaths prohibited euthanasia , and only 8 percent prohibited abortion . 
  **   providing poisonous drugs would certainly have been viewed as immoral by contemporary physicians if it resulted in murder ; however , the absolute ban described in the oath also forbids euthanasia . 
  several accounts of ancient physicians willingly assisting suicides have survived [ 11 ] . 
  multiple explanations for the prohibition of euthanasia in the oath have been proposed : it is possible that not all physicians swore the oath , or that the oath was seeking to prevent widely held concerns that physicians could be employed as political assassins [ 12 ] . 
  the oath 's prohibition of abortion is also not found in contemporary medical texts . 
  the hippocratic text on the nature of the child contains a description of an abortion , without any implication that it was morally wrong [ 13 ] , and descriptions of abortifacient medications are numerous in the ancient medical literature [ 14 ] . 
  while many christian versions of the hippocratic oath , particularly from the middle-ages , explicitly prohibited abortion , the prohibition is often omitted from many oaths taken in us medical schools today , though it remains controversial  as with scribonius largus , there seemed to be no question to soranus that the hippocratic oath prohibits abortion , although apparently not all doctors adhered to it strictly in his time . 
  according to soranus ' 1st or 2nd century ad work gynaecology , one party of medical practitioners banished all abortives as required by the hippocratic oath ; the other party -- to which he belonged -- was willing to prescribe abortions , but only for the sake of the mother 's health . 
   the hippocratic oath has been superseded as a document of professional ethics by more extensive , regularly updated ethical codes issued by national medical associations , such as the ama code of medical ethics ( first adopted in 1847 ) , and the british general medical council 's good medical practice . 
  these documents provide a comprehensive overview of the obligations and professional behaviour of a doctor to their patients and wider society . 
  doctors who violate these codes may be subjected to disciplinary proceedings , including the loss of their licence to practice medicine . 
  nonetheless , the length of these documents has made their distillations into shorter oaths an attractive proposition . 
  in light of this fact , several updates to the oath have been offered in modern times , [ 22 ] [ 23 ] some facetious . 
  [ 24 ] can you point where in the modern version of the oath or declaration of geneva you find a stance on abortion [ geneva ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/declaration_of_geneva ) oath : i swear to fulfill , to the best of my ability and judgment , this covenant : ... 
  i will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps i walk , and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow . 
  i will apply , for the benefit of the sick , all measures which are required , avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism . 
  i will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science , and that warmth , sympathy , and understanding may outweigh the surgeon 's knife or the chemist 's drug . 
  i will not be ashamed to say `` i know not , '' nor will i fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient 's recovery . 
  i will respect the privacy of my patients , for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know . 
  most especially must i tread with care in matters of life and death . 
  above all , i must not play at god . 
  i will remember that i do not treat a fever chart , a cancerous growth , but a sick human being , whose illness may affect the person 's family and economic stability . 
  my responsibility includes these related problems , if i am to care adequately for the sick . 
  i will prevent disease whenever i can but i will always look for a path to a cure for all diseases . 
  i will remember that i remain a member of society , with special obligations to all my fellow human beings , those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm . 
  if i do not violate this oath , may i enjoy life and art , respected while i live and remembered with affection thereafter . 
  may i always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may i long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help . 
   in a 1989 survey of 126 us medical schools , only three reported use of the original oath , while thirty-three used the declaration of geneva , sixty-seven used a modified hippocratic oath , four used the oath of maimonides , one used a covenant , eight used another oath , one used an unknown oath , and two did not use any kind of oath . 
  seven medical schools did not reply to the survey . 
  since when do we have a crippling moral duty to protect life or living creatures ? 
  we kill people all the time , destroy entire ecosystems , there is no such thing as a right to live . 
  so even if you think the fetus is a human being , that alone does not give it any rights . 
  and since it has not been granted any citizenship , meaning no state has ownership or oversight , nor can it articulate it 's desires , nor can it live on it 's own , it 's guardian makes decisions for it , based on personal choice rather than rights , which are protected and enforced by a state not a natural occurrence , as only a born person can have rights and there is no right to live anyway . 
  do n't we already do this when we let family decide whether a born living person should be pulled of life sustaining machines?in this example the person can no longer make conscious decisions , express desire or preference , and being a citizen ( or just simply being ) does not give him a right to live . 
  well here life support is big mamma and she can pull the plug anytime she wants . 
  since this is also a question of morality , by banning abortion you 're removing the only possible other answer making it more like a moral assertion , so the only way to keep both sides happy is to have abortion a choice . 
  nobody is making you have an abortion , nobody should make you not have an abortion . 
  [ plus us is at record unemployment ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/us_unemployment_measures.svg/720px-us_unemployment_measures.svg.png ) on every type of measure ( u1-u6 ) so the robots/chinese stealing jobs is overblown to say the least .

  [ this is a map ] ( https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/77697/width754/image-20150412-4058-y1b0iu.jpeg ) of the territorial water of eu ( blue ) , uk ( red ) , non-eu ( green ) . 
  norway actually has 3 agreements on managing fishing with the eu . 
  for example : the irish catch peaked at 407,000 tonnes in 1995 which gave ireland a 59 % share ; norway peaked at 459,000 tonnes in 2005 giving ireland a 31 % share and in 2010 ireland had a 60 % share with at 260,000 tonnes and norway was down to 135,000 . 
  [ example 2  ( https://www.fishupdate.com/scotland-and-norway-welcome-eu-fish-deal/ ) and you can read more [ here ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/international/agreements/norway ) now what i 'm trying to convey here is that it 's foolish to argue that anyone should have had exclusive use a 200 mile zone and every other country with a coastline the same entitlement . 
  because we overlap and only that but the fish themselves move quite a bit . 
  looking at the above map again . 
   although uk waters are extensive , as the map below shows , the fish stocks which live in our waters are by no means confined to them . 
  some , like mackerel , make extensive migrations and only pass through our waters for a short period . 
  others are more sedentary , like prawns which stay close to their burrows in muddy habitats . 
   many species live in different places either at different times of the year or in different phases of their life cycle . 
  in the case of north sea herring for example , most of the juveniles live in the south east corner around the german bight , whereas the adults tend to congregate around the shetland isles prior to spawning at various sites along the british coast . 
  north sea cod are found throughout the north sea but prefer spawning along the border between uk and norwegian waters . 
  so despite the uk having quite extensive waters , fish stocks do not respect political boundaries , and many are mobile at some stage in their life : these fish are exclusive to neither the uk , the eu , nor the bordering scandinavian states , but are a shared resource . 
  it would be a major undertaking to establish exactly which proportions of each fish stock would occupy any national waters . 
  these are also likely to change throughout the year , and from year to year . 
  the cfp was designed to manage the mobile fishing fleets that pursue these common , mobile resources . 
  also you need to consider the value of the fish being fished : for example , the [ uk gets ] ( https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/77698/width754/image-20150412-4090-18e0g7w.jpeg ) 84 % of the north sea haddock quota , 81 % of north sea monkfish quota and 98 % of west of scotland prawn quota ; but only 4 % of north sea sprat quota , 18 % of northern hake and 28 % of north sea plaice . 
  [  more than one fourth of the value of landings for the eu-28 in 2015 also came into spanish ports \\ ( 28 % or eur 2.0 billion \\ ) , reflecting the high value attached to its landings of species like tuna , hake , swordfish , squid and pilchards . 
  landings in italy had the next highest value \\ ( eur 0.9 billion \\ ) , followed by the united kingdom \\ ( eur 0.8 billion \\ ) and france \\ ( eur 0.8 billion \\ ) . 
  denmark only accounted for a relatively small share \\ ( 7 % in 2015 \\ ) of eu-28 landings in terms of value \\ ( eur 0.5 billion \\ ) . 
  the values of landings to ports in iceland \\ ( eur 1.0 billion \\ ) and norway \\ ( eur 2.0 billion \\ ) were closer to the values of france and spain respectively , reflecting the lower average price of the species landed in each of these countries .
