  cfp is calculated in the following way . 
   the cfp sets quotas for how much of each species can be caught in a certain ices statistical area or groups of areas on a yearly or two-yearly basis . 
  each country is given a quota based upon the total available ( total allowable catch , tac ) and their traditional share ( percentage ) . 
  tacs are fixed annually by the council of ministers . 
  they consider proposals drawn up by the european commission , which consults its own scientific advisers ( scientific , technical and economic committee of fisheries , stecf ) . 
  stecf generally provides its advice to the european commission taking account of the work conducted by the international council for the exploration of the sea ( ices ) . 
  the council of ministers furthermore ( when relevant ) takes account of the views of non-eu fishing nations and the advice coming directly from ices , which is independent of eu institutions . 
  after quotas are fixed by the council of ministers , each eu member state is responsible for policing its own quota . 
  countries distribute their quotas among fishermen using different systems . 
  so even if the uk leaves the cft ships fishing in uk waters will not change unless you allow free reign and no quotas or you make a new deal where you convince the eu block to lower its own landings for the sake of the uk ( not gon na happen as agreement is already quite fair in the eyes of the council of which uk is still part of ) . 
  cft is a good and fair deal for all parties . 
  do you think the deal is unfair ? 
  how would this move by the uk improve the deal ? 
  [ this is a map ] ( https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/77697/width754/image-20150412-4058-y1b0iu.jpeg ) of the territorial water of eu ( blue ) , uk ( red ) , non-eu ( green ) . 
  norway actually has 3 agreements on managing fishing with the eu . 
  for example : the irish catch peaked at 407,000 tonnes in 1995 which gave ireland a 59 % share ; norway peaked at 459,000 tonnes in 2005 giving ireland a 31 % share and in 2010 ireland had a 60 % share with at 260,000 tonnes and norway was down to 135,000 . 
  [ example 2  ( https://www.fishupdate.com/scotland-and-norway-welcome-eu-fish-deal/ ) and you can read more [ here ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/cfp/international/agreements/norway ) now what i 'm trying to convey here is that it 's foolish to argue that anyone should have had exclusive use a 200 mile zone and every other country with a coastline the same entitlement . 
  because we overlap and only that but the fish themselves move quite a bit . 
  looking at the above map again . 
   although uk waters are extensive , as the map below shows , the fish stocks which live in our waters are by no means confined to them . 
  some , like mackerel , make extensive migrations and only pass through our waters for a short period . 
  others are more sedentary , like prawns which stay close to their burrows in muddy habitats . 
   many species live in different places either at different times of the year or in different phases of their life cycle . 
  in the case of north sea herring for example , most of the juveniles live in the south east corner around the german bight , whereas the adults tend to congregate around the shetland isles prior to spawning at various sites along the british coast . 
  north sea cod are found throughout the north sea but prefer spawning along the border between uk and norwegian waters . 
  so despite the uk having quite extensive waters , fish stocks do not respect political boundaries , and many are mobile at some stage in their life : these fish are exclusive to neither the uk , the eu , nor the bordering scandinavian states , but are a shared resource . 
  it would be a major undertaking to establish exactly which proportions of each fish stock would occupy any national waters . 
  these are also likely to change throughout the year , and from year to year . 
  the cfp was designed to manage the mobile fishing fleets that pursue these common , mobile resources . 
  also you need to consider the value of the fish being fished : for example , the [ uk gets ] ( https://cdn.theconversation.com/files/77698/width754/image-20150412-4090-18e0g7w.jpeg ) 84 % of the north sea haddock quota , 81 % of north sea monkfish quota and 98 % of west of scotland prawn quota ; but only 4 % of north sea sprat quota , 18 % of northern hake and 28 % of north sea plaice . 
  [  more than one fourth of the value of landings for the eu-28 in 2015 also came into spanish ports \\ ( 28 % or eur 2.0 billion \\ ) , reflecting the high value attached to its landings of species like tuna , hake , swordfish , squid and pilchards . 
  landings in italy had the next highest value \\ ( eur 0.9 billion \\ ) , followed by the united kingdom \\ ( eur 0.8 billion \\ ) and france \\ ( eur 0.8 billion \\ ) . 
  denmark only accounted for a relatively small share \\ ( 7 % in 2015 \\ ) of eu-28 landings in terms of value \\ ( eur 0.5 billion \\ ) . 
  the values of landings to ports in iceland \\ ( eur 1.0 billion \\ ) and norway \\ ( eur 2.0 billion \\ ) were closer to the values of france and spain respectively , reflecting the lower average price of the species landed in each of these countries .

  cft is a good and fair deal for all parties . 
  so when people think you 're going to over-fish by leaving the cft , it 's because that 's the only option you actually gain . 
  why point a gun if you 're not gon na use it ? 
  so should germany/netherlands/belgium catch all the fish before they go to uk waters thereby disrupting their mating cycle , or should we divide a common area where we all fish matured fish ? 
  do you think these agreements where made just to fuck the uk?do you think what norway is doing is sustainable if everyone starts doing it again ? 
  need more straws for that straw man there buddy . 
  nah you 're just an idiot and never actually read the links , is n't weird how everyone read and understood them except for 3-4 people who keep repeating the same arguments without even at least reading the relevant information . 
  fish do not respect national borders , they migrate and live in different places . 
  i know it 's hard to grasp thru your thick pig skull but at least try . 
   in addition to this , the proposal to ban foreign vessels as some have advocated is likely to be incompatible with international law as many fishing rights stretch as far back as the middle ages . 
  calls for such a ban also do n't acknowledge that british boats also operate in other nations ' waters regularly to fish , sell at foreign ports and undergo vessel repairs . 
  the uk fishing industry itself opposes such a ban . 
  so your claim that the entire industry supports pulling out is unfounded . 
  first of it ; s not uk fish in the first place . 
   these figures include various fish which live beyond the boundaries of uk waters , such as arctic cod and west of ireland sole . 
  if one considers the 73 different fish stocks which live in uk waters , the total eu quota was 1,920,915 tonnes , of which 585,211 tonnes was allocated to the uk ( which also happens to be 30 % ) . 
  individual quota allocations differ according to stock , as figure one below shows . 
  for example , the uk gets 84 % of the north sea haddock quota , 81 % of north sea monkfish quota and 98 % of west of scotland prawn quota ; but only 4 % of north sea sprat quota , 18 % of northern hake and 28 % of north sea plaice . 
   although uk waters are extensive , as the map below shows , the fish stocks which live in our waters are by no means confined to them . 
  some , like mackerel , make extensive migrations and only pass through our waters for a short period . 
  others are more sedentary , like prawns which stay close to their burrows in muddy habitats . 
   there 's a good reason for non-british boats in our waters you may have read that foreign countries are in our waters and catching all the british fish . 
  while the whole concept of `` british fish '' is nonsensical to begin with , it 's worth exploring how quota is allocated between countries in the eu . 
   the allocation of quota between eu member states is largely determined by historic catch shares - the `` relative stability '' - of member states over a reference period ( 1973-78 ) just before the cfp was brought into force . 
  under this method , countries fishing in each other 's waters during the reference period continue to have the right to do so . 
  sing a reference period is at least as reasonable as any alternative method of determining national shares and is also applied when setting quotas with countries outside of the eu . 
   in addition to this , the proposal to ban foreign vessels as some have advocated is likely to be incompatible with international law as many fishing rights stretch as far back as the middle ages . 
  calls for such a ban also do n't acknowledge that british boats also operate in other nations ' waters regularly to fish , sell at foreign ports and undergo vessel repairs . 
  the uk fishing industry itself opposes such a ban . 
  second . 
   consider the controversial cornelis vrolijk , a dutch-owned 114-metre vessel that holds 23 % of total english fishing quota . 
  while the quota concentration is shocking , it is not a result of eu management ; the vessel is deemed english under uk law and any quota assigned and requirement to land a certain share of fish in the uk is therefore set by the uk government itself . 
   as small ports disappear and profits for the small-scale fleet decline despite large increases for the rest of the industry , all major parties in the last uk election promised to ensure more quota for low-impact and small-scale fishing . 
  here , the cfp may help to ensure that this promise is implemented . 
  while not stipulating what specific criteria are used , article 17 of the cfp stipulates that quota should be allocated according to `` transparent and objective criteria '' and greenpeace is currently taking the uk government to court for failing to implement this article which could bring tremendous economic and social benefits if implemented . 
  it 's not uk 's fish in the first place , that 's the point , nature does not respect borders .

  he has as much power as any other hedge fund , investing and speculating are part of a market economy , what exactly did he do apart from betting against currencies that seemed overvalued to him ? 
  this is completely legal and normal . 
  speculation and investment is not in any form illegal . 
  http://www.businessinsider.de/how-george-soros-broke-the-bank-of-thailand-2016-9?r=us&amp;ir=t  the asian financial crisis started as a localized currency and financial crisis in thailand , but tremors soon spread to other southeast asian countries -- including malaysia , indonesia and the philippines . 
  by the fall of 1997 , the contagion extended its reach to south korea , hong kong and china , the year after russia and brazil saw their economies enter a free-fall , japan fell into recession at the end of 1998 and the us financial system balked at the possible bankruptcy of the infamous long term capital management . 
   the asian crisis started in august 1997 , only a month after thai authorities abandoned the us dollar thai baht peg . 
  the baht had been pegged to the dollar for more than a decade , and the thai authorities had been encouraging banks and big corporates to borrow us dollars unhedged to fuel domestic lending for much of this period . 
  however , as the us dollar got stronger in the mid-90s , thailand 's trade and capital accounts deteriorated , firm 's found it difficult to meet dollar debt obligations and it became apparent the peg was unsustainable . 
   as soon as the peg was abandoned , it quickly became clear how bad the situation had deteriorated . 
  thai authorities left the peg on july 2 , 1997 , and by october 24 the free floating baht had depreciated by 60 % against the dollar . 
  thailand 's troubles triggered a wave of speculation against other asian currencies and over the same period the indonesian rupiah , malaysian ringgit , and philippine peso depreciated by 47 % , 35 % , and 34 % , respectively . 
   ** did soros start the crisis ? 
  ** according to sources who had knowledge of the quantum fund 's positioning at the time , soros bet just under $ 1 billion of his total war chest of $ 12 billion against the baht . 
  there 's plenty of speculation that because he placed such a large bet on baht , soros helped engineer the asian crisis via his political connections . 
  yet soros was n't the biggest single speculator to hold a position against the currency .
