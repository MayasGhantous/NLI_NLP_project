  it depends on what you consider a longer period , we 'll hardly have a month of straight below freezing point temperatures , but it 's expected to be low ( a bit above or below the freezing point ) . 
  this winter has been rather warm all over the europe though , it seems the real winter has come a bit late . 
  the snow freezing is quite common . 
  the only way for snow to melt relatively quickly is smog . 
  had it not been for the fire destroying a good deal of the city , chances are it would still be the capital . 
   yes , like in southern sweden . 
  it melts within a day or so since it 's never freezing temperatures on the ground . 
  i do n't know about sweden , but it does n't melt within a day . 
  it can be for a week or more even it is n't snowing anymore . 
  around 120 meters above sea level . 
  it 's right underneath [ medvednica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/medvednica ) . 
  interestingly , `` grozni '' translates to `` awful '' in croatian . 
  do n't know if that 's the case with russian . 
   streets are empty past 6 p.m. 
  there are no coffee shops . 
  even bars do n't operate except on the weekends , '' he said . 
  `` simply , this is the land of boredom and misery . 
  poor swedes . 
   his mother tounge is english and he struggles a bit with croatian [ at least milanovi\u0107 is pleased ] ( https://scontent-vie1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/12392013_488975081274766_8803966849149522765_n.jpg?oh=898a3a4f5e19bec0e3be5353f15b0699&amp;oe=57117db4 ), 
  yeah , slovenian language is hilarious . 
  i do n't think they should be translating the name of the `` party '' most to bridge . 
  in such case , it 's best to stick with original , especially since it does n't sound too bad in english . 
  home alone and the christmas carol hands down . 
  i feel angels are the least practical of the three , with spire being the most practical . 
  does n't seem like something that can balance all that well when put on top . 
  and they 're too flashy . 
  either a star or a spire . 
  the refugee crisis may have only faded in the media , the numbers however have n't , they are more or less constant . 
  she was n't speaking kajkavian . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2u29os/draw_your_own_map_of_europe_from_your_memory_only/ ) 's a thread from almost a year ago if anyone 's wondering how users fared back then . 
  i 'd guess so , it is a literary symbol . 
  however , it found its use in more or less everyday croatian . 
  how 's the situation in spain ? 
  not just soviet , we use it in croatia too . 
  in croatia , `` apolon '' is usually used to describe a very ripped male person , who could match the ideal of male physique . 
  i 've heard the first two , though usually the english one is used when someone acts like he does n't understand you . 
  and it could also be `` pretend to be chinese '' . 
  the third one i heard maybe once or twice , i had no idea it 's a nationality-related idiom . 
  never heard of the fourth one , i ca n't quite wrap my head around it . 
  from what does it stem ? 
  that old communist parliament in bulgaria ? 
  two more that come to mind : srpska/slovenska/balkanska posla ( serbian/slovenian/balkan jobs - shady/nonsensical stuff ) ima ih kak rusa/kineza . 
  ( there 's as many of them as there are russians/chinese . ), 
  other than that i dunno . 
  if it makes you feel any better , i 've never heard of it . 
   he basically answered : this is also your problem and not only ours , so f + ck you , ** we are not going to play the chinese wall for you and play buffer ** . 
  is n't that what they kinda did with the fences though ? 
  remembre 2008 !, 
  and 2012 !, 
  last time i checked ( maybe two days ago ) the statistic from ministry of internal affairs , the number was very close to 500 000 , it 's probably over that number now . 
  anyways , everyone knows dublin is dead , even our president said it yesterday . 
  some luck . 
  is the song supposed to be somehow connected to vara\u017edin ? 
  seems quite off to me , aside from some bits here and there . 
   to be fair - i 'd shut down my twitter accounts if i was falsely accused of something and it became very popular on the internet . 
  you would n't come forth with evidence denying the false accussations or at least publicly deny it ? 
  that 's unwise at very least . 
   how many times has one redditor slandered another redditor forcing them to shut down their reddit accounts regardless of the truth ? 
  that 's right , every day . 
  this is not comparable in the slightest . 
  we 're not talking about redditors here , and not about slander either . 
  the ministry of interior simply published a `` demanti '' ( denial ) where they detailed his stay and added a picture of his passport for additional reliability . 
   maybe croatia is right . 
  maybe this journalist is right . 
  one thing is for sure - these witch-hunting redditors have n't a fucking clue who is right . 
  i 've already pointed out the disconnect between his youtube videos and his story , it 's not shaping up for him . 
  i 've watched his videos on youtube before he took them down and there was no footage from either zagreb , slovenia , austria or germany . 
  the only footage shot in croatia was him in train , saying how he hid in toilets to avoid the police . 
  i 've checked his instagram too , and surprise , surprise - there were no photos either . 
  he just jumps straight from tovarnik to paris . 
  that 's a little weird if you 're trying to describe your great journey ? 
  also , the fact that he shut down both his twitter accounts and removed any activity from his youtube channel ( and the videos ) and that he was registered leaving croatia at zagreb airport is very telling . 
  he was linking to that twitter account on his youtube videos , you can check [ it ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5nkxuiyjg ) . 
  but this twitter account of yours seems legit as well , it will be interesting to see whether he will have any comments . 
  also , what i find interesting about his video is how he never showed any footage from either zagreb , slovenia , austria or germany , he jumped straight to paris from a train passing border crossing at tovarnik . 
  [ it seems he ( emile ghessen ) went off twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/geese12 ) . 
  and off facebook ( https://www.facebook.co/emile.ghessen/?fref=nf ) ca n't fully link it , automodertor removes it . 
  at least his [ instagram ] ( https://www.instagram.com/emileghessen/ ) and [ youtube channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucstxkriaajoow38yksl2mjw ) are up , i guess, 
  [ official site of ministry of interior , translated by google ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.mup.hr%2f225695.aspx&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  additionally , his documented point of entry was at railway border crossing tovarnik ( 23 november 2015 , 14:10 ) , but his exit point was zagreb airport pleso ( 24 november 2015 , 17:20 ) . 
  i do n't see how he could have gone through slovenia and austria via train . 
  maybe if he came back to zagreb via plane again .

  maybe if he came back to zagreb via plane again after his brunch in england , and then continued by train . 
  dubrovnik for the win , lol . 
  yeah , that and d\u017e / \u0111 , and ije/je . 
   your linguists do n't agree . 
  :p it 's okay , i do n't agree with them either . 
  :p tbh , it just gives headaches to most people , only linguists prolly care about it . 
  there 's really no difference . 
  you learn where to put each by reading . 
  does this map mean baroque art as in architecture , paintings , literature or what ? 
  but it 's ridiculous there 's nothing for croatia . 
  at least [ vara\u017edin ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vara%c5%bedin ) , considering it trully is a baroque city/town , sporting many baroque palaces and hosting baroque music festivals . 
  there are also baroque building in other croatian cities , and there are numerous baroque castles in zagorje countryside and slavonia . 
  as for literature , we had writers from all over croatia , which were usually grouped in 4 regional literature circles depending on their stlye : * kajkavian * : juraj habdeli\u0107 * dalmatia-dubrovnik * : ivan gunduli\u0107 , junije palmoti\u0107 , ivan buni\u0107 vu\u010di\u0107 , ignjat \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 , stijepo \u0110ur\u0111evi\u0107 , vladislav men\u010deti\u0107 , petar kaneveli\u0107 , * slavonian * : antun kani\u017eli\u0107 * ozalj * : petar zrinski , ana katarina zrinski , fran krsto frankopan , ivan belostenec , i prolly omitted some too , but i did n't want to delve too deep . 
  i 'll chime in with [ this video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc_rdjxxf8q ) as well . 
  [ not advent related , but still a nice video of winter in zagreb .
