  building it on other 's territory is undoubtedly the balkan way . 
  yes , it 's very real . 
  [ this ] ( http://www.tjedno.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mg_9336.jpg ) is how they usually look , but they [ color them ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/bf/72/bf729f2169e752616546b22927ea5755.jpg ) on different occassions . 
   you on the other hand just complain he 's staying true to the european values !, 
  they were so happy they were crying . 
   erjavec said that croatia was interpreting the course of the border `` as it suits it '' , asking slovenia that the border be determined in line with the borders of cadastral municipalities , whereas in the case of its border with serbia it wanted it to run along the middle of the danube river , which slovenia could not accept . 
  this is such utter bullshit and downright lying . 
  croatia wants the borders on danube to be determined by cadastral municipalities , whereas serbia wants it to be on the middle of danube . 
  currently , it is agreed upon both by serbia and croatia that the border is on the middle of the river until the issue gets resolved , because it 's more practical . 
  also , not all of the border is unclear as he puts it , the disputes are over savudrijska vala and sv . 
  gera ( which slovenia occupied in the 90 's ) . 
  it 's ridiculous . 
  they went over private property with that fence and ruined people 's crops . 
  c'mon , give them a break , they do n't even know where their borders are . 
  can you expect something more ? 
  no , it would n't . 
  the borders were pretty clear , it 's just that slovenia is sloppy enough not to care to actually follow them . 
  they put the fence into private property and actually ruined some guy 's crops . 
  there 's stuff like cadastral books or even google maps , if you 're not a complete moron , you 'd at least have a look there before putting the fence . 
  an interesting approach , some were talking about a posibillity of sdp and hdz forming the government of national unity , but nothing came out of it - it was just rumors . 
  seems most will try to force them together , it would help dissuade some people from voting for hdz or sdp , since a lot of them vote * contra * rather than * pro * party . 
  they also need manpower to change the constitution in order to follow through with some of their reforms . 
  new elections could bring even bigger support for most . 
  edit : [ karamarko refused the proposal ] ( http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/karamarko-ne-odustaje-od-fotelje-premijera-ne-zelimo-biti-u-vladi-s-nesposobnim-sdpom/855321.aspx ) , so we might be looking at new elections . 
  not a single mention of any other party even though it seems neither sdp nor hdz will be able to form the government without the support of the third largest . 
  and only 22 % of votes have been counted , with following results : hdz-ova koalicija 60 ( hdz-u su pribrojana 3 mandata iz dijaspore ) sdp-ova koalicija 55 most 19 ids 4 \u017divi zid 1 hdssb 2 bandi\u0107 2 but they did manage to shoehorn migrant crisis , despite it not being that relevant to the elections . 
  pretty crappy article , as was the earlier one from bbc . 
  so many of them [ missing in croatia ] ( http://www.ratebeer.com/breweries/croatia/0/53/ ) , if not more, 
  ah , what a wonderful day to play some [ super karamarko ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_525blshnas ), 
  you do realise those percentages come from a low turnout ? 
  you were visiting seaside ? 
  it 's a given bakeries , ice cream shops and restaurants might have similar menus - same could be said for most of europe . 
  hungary 's cool too !, 
  different folk songs , different historical backgrounds , different types of foods , etc. 
  balkans feels pretty foreign , and i do n't mean it in a negative way , just not `` compatible '' . 
   though , zizek got it mixed up - we were both in the austrian and hungarian part of the monarchy . 
  i 've already compared it to europe . 
  it 's somewhere in the middle . 
  it 's not perfect , but it 's definitely not as big as you make it up to be . 
   go find the wikipedia page about cigarettes per capita . 
  that will clarify things . 
  the numbers are exactly the same as on the map , what 's to clarify ? 
  so by :  yes , you are just like the rest of us . 
  you actually meant :  i mean croatia is in the balkan penisula . 
  okay , i guess you just struggle a bit with expressing yourself in english . 
  anyways , it 's partially in the peninsula and people do n't generally consider it as balkans ( it 's how it 's taught in schools ) . 
  some mention balkan influences ( turkey , serbia ) and that 's about it . 
  honestly , wikipedia can be edited by anyone . 
  that 's not really what i asked you to elaborate :  yes , you are just like the rest of us . 
   there 's nothing to discuss whatever floats your boat then i guess . 
   how so ? 
  because we did n't have too much to do with balkans throughout history and we do n't really fit in culturally ( if we are to speak of a balkan culture , people seem bent on it ) . 
  i 'd compare the case with slovenia . 
  croatia is usually mentioned just because of yugoslavia , which i think is wrong . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  because i wholeheartedly disagree . 
  what are you talking [ about ] ( http://jakubmarian.com/average-cigarette-consumption-per-capita-by-country-in-europe-map/ ) ? 
  cigarette consumption in croatia is not that big compared to other european countries , and , unlike us , we have healthcare that actually works and wo n't cost you a kidney for treating a cold . 
  also , croatia is not really balkan ... 
  why , we 're trying to find out if sweden is a virgin of course !, 
  also , croatians are more aggressive ( not saying that 's a bad thing - slovenian governments are really pussies ) in their foreign policy and hence the border is still not set to this day . 
  not really , it 's just that slovenians are [ too prone to machinations for anything to work ] ( http://vijesti.hrt.hr/293404/milanovic-i-celnici-stranaka-o-sudbini-arbitraznog-sporazuma-sa-slovenijom ) , even if it were an already shady enough arbitration . 
  also , it 's laughable to hear from slovenians anything about croatians being agressive in foreign policy when they esentially used eu/nato accession talks as a tool of blackmail . 
  it was as balkan as it can get . 
  no , it did n't . 
  i think every country should start preparing for a possibility of germany/austria closing the borders , they are uncooperative enough as is , and giving the rest the middlefinger . 
  2500 is not going to work unless we implement very strict border controls . 
  and at that point , we might as well build a fence , else it would be hard securing the borders when people are coming in droves . 
  no need for explaining , i 'm fully aware balkan/byzantium is usually flung as an insult , but your statement was still in big discordance with reality . 
  however , if you meant it as in a hyperbole/exaggeration ( as some idioms are ) , then it 's use is a bit more understandable . 
  i 'm not a fan of this , but hey - people use it like that . 
  negativity and the perception aside , i still do n't like using it because from some cultural standpoint ( traditions and etc. ), 
  it does n't really represent us ( croatians ) . 
  so you either get assigned some bs stereotype which is in fact incorrect , or you feel like odd one out . 
  there 's no winning . 
   what annoyed me the most is the `` face '' of that group . 
  extremely rude , to put it mildly , what 's - her-face . 
  if you have n't seen it , go dig out some videos where she was arguing with `` normal '' people . 
  it was really a great shame that the referendum passed . 
  completely unnecessary , it was a giant waste of money . 
  however , considering the passiveness/apathy/notcaring of croatians , i 'm hoping one of the governments could reverse the decision some time in the future ( and maybe even push for gay marriages ) . 
  there would be some uproar and grumbling , but nothing would happen . 
   i 'm mentioning it because the whole thing firmly put us firmly in the balkan . 
  i might be a tiny bit angry and bitter yeah , you are . 
  you 're not really informed either , which is stateggering considering the implied emotional investment on your side . 
  the referendum passed , but the turnout was 38 % . 
  it would fail had the government not tempered with the referendum laws prior to the eu accession referendum . 
  in the end , marriage was constitutionally defined as companionship between man and woman . 
  however , we do have civil unions which are basically like marriage , minus adopting the kids . 
  take a look at the [ map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/same_sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg/680px-same_sex_marriage_map_europe_detailed.svg.png ) , and see that `` this whole thing firmly putting us in the balkan '' is bullshit . 
  i 'm not quite sure what you meant by that , but i can guess . 
  if anything , the situation is most similar to central europe ( us and hungary even have the same `` color '' , we 're the only ones like that ) . 
  edit : i think slovenia should be dark blue on the map . 
  now , now , no fighting . 
  there 's syria for everyone !, 
  well , they tried to become one . 
  :p france is also interesting . 
  they worry about spain too . 
  i wonder whether they have geography in schools . 
  handball .
