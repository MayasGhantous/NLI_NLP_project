  those are in chakavian , you can tell by verb conjugation ( vzeo instead of vzel/zel and vu\u010dijo instead of vu\u010dil ) . 
  but it 's pretty similar to kajkavian too . 
   you say i am wrong , then you confirm everything i said . 
  i have no `` wishes '' i am just stating the obvious . 
  i did n't confirm everything you said , just read the post and do n't make stuff up . 
   and no there are no `` serbisms '' , that 's why i used quotation marks , cause i was quoting croatian linguists . 
  good , those croatian linguists are in the wrong . 
   that specific book by krleza was written in dialect so far removed from todays croatian that even croatians would have trouble understanding it and even in the days when it was published the book contained the vocabulary of less known words and phrases . 
  so that example is ridicolous . 
  it was written in a mix of kajkavian dialects , it 's easily understandable today to those who have a basic knowledge of kajkavian and it 's ** croatian ** whether you like it or not . 
  it 's not ridiculous , it 's an example . 
  you do n't get to shaft and ignore other parts of the language just because it does n't fit your view . 
   and it is petrica , not perica . 
  whatever ... 
  thank you . 
  i was unsure at that point , and after writting such a long post i could n't bring myself to google it . 
  corrected . 
  whew , you threw together a lot of bull . 
   ljudevit gaj and vuk karadzic worked together and at the same time on standardization of grammar and alphabet for croatian/serbian languages waaaaaay before yugoslavia . 
  in mid xix century . 
  why do you think both languages have 30 letters , same grammar and why croatian latin and serbian latin scripts are identical and why both are phonetic languages etc ? 
  this i already addressed in my original post and clarified it in my second . 
  i think i was pretty clear . 
   also croatian language had two-three purges , especially around wwi and wwi and recently in the '90s . 
  croatian had a few `` purges '' , but not like you think . 
  they were never about targetting `` serbisms '' ( are there really any ? 
  ) , but loanwords in general . 
  it 's a lot like french puritanism . 
  i 'll give you the wwii one , their agenda was pretty obvious and i would not put past them that their goal was to `` remove serb '' in every sense . 
  however , wwi was a load of crap , since it never happened . 
  indeed , there was a lot of new words introduced in that period ( say 1850s-1910s ) , but it was , again , just to remove loanwords from standard in general , primarily ** hungarian ** and ** german ** since there were loads of them . 
  no one had serbia in mind , but some had yugoslavia - which goes back to political tampering with languages due to agenda . 
  some words caught on , some did n't ( as always ) . 
  90 's was about reintroducing the words that fell out of use due to yugoslavia ( people had to adhere to the standard set by novosadski dogovor which was mentioned here already , and abberations were definitely not tolerated , hence i called it forced instead of voluntarily ) . 
  some were border cases , but the vast majority of it was just returning to the roots . 
   so in a sense two languages were more similar before wwii . 
  yes , and after . 
  wwii-era language was something else , but it still had roots in historical croatian language . 
   for example did you ever heard of miroslav krleza ? 
  of course . 
   the greatest croatian writer who ever lived ? 
  while he is no doubt a great writer , that 's debatable . 
  there 's a slew of great croatian writers and i 'm glad i ca n't pick one so easily . 
   maybe sounds familiar ? 
  maybe . 
   heard about his book `` hiljadu i jedna smrt '' from 1932 ? 
  yeah `` hiljadu i jedna smrt '' , not '' tisu\u0107u i jedna smrt '' what 's the point ? 
  you 're literally just trying to make a point going off by the title of the book . 
  that 's massive reaching and does you a disservice . 
  you also need to take into account his period of writting , during which there was a heavy push towards yugoslavian unity . 
  i doubt you ever read any of his works , but i did and there 's nothing too different from today 's croatian , except for a few details that are understandable when we take into account the times during which were his works created . 
  just check his `` balade petrice kerempuha '' and see if you still want to claim croatian and serbian are the same . 
  but since you were so eager to bring krle\u017ea up , i have to mention he was one of the academics who signed [ `` declaration about the name and position of croatian literaly language '' ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/deklaracija_o_nazivu_i_polo%c5%beaju_hrvatskog_knji%c5%beevnog_jezika ) , which was in direct opposition to [ novosadski sporazum ] ( https://sh.wikipedia.org/wiki/novosadski_dogovor ) . 
  so , he would very much disagree with you . 
   `` hiljadu '' would be considered `` serbism '' and you would get yelled at by your teacher if you used in croatia no , you would n't . 
  i 've known people who freely used `` hiljadu '' when talking to teachers of croatian language . 
  besides , `` hiljadu '' is a grecizam ( a loanword from greek language ) , not a `` serbism '' . 
  really , are there any serbisms ? 
   not to mention shit ton of new words that were invented recently by croatian linguists , just to be as different from serbian as possible . 
  again incorrect . 
  a lot of them were used before , and their date of creation was in 19th century . 
  google bogoslav \u0160ulek , adolfo veber tkal\u010devi\u0107 and their ilk . 
  `` bruh '' , i know my history just fine . 
  i do n't want to comment on your knowledge of serbian ( i do n't really care ) , but your knowledge about croatian history is frankly atrocious and it 's honestly downright insulting that you feel like you can coherently explain it , especially to a croatian . 
   we use both `` hleb '' and `` kruh '' , both `` vazduh '' and `` zrak '' , both `` sargarepa '' and `` mrkva '' etc. 
  bosnian and serbian went for language richness , while croatian went for language purity . 
  vazduh , sargareba and hleb were never used in croatia . 
  not in a day-to-day situations anyways , so there was no point to ever include it into standard . 
  on the other hand , mrkva , zrak and kruh all stem from praslavic and were always in use . 
   so in conclusion , no , yugoslavia did n't forcefully bring those two languages together , they already were pretty much the same . 
  it 's your conslusion based entirely on your faulty conjectures , which are again , i feel , based on your wishes . 
  the idea of yugoslavia ** and ** yugoslavia were the driving force behind bringing those two languages closer together . 
  there 's no denying it . 
  you can check the texts from before the pan-southslavic movements . 
  cool , that was just my little caveat . 
  it happened in a similar period , afterall their goal was to create an union of south slavic nations ( which later became known as yugoslavia ) , and one way of making it happen was to achieve cohesion through unified language . 
  it 's all politics in the end . 
  except both austria and germany were in the same geographical and cultural area as part of the holy roman empire and their national divergence came a lot latter . 
  you can say being of austrian nationality ( and ethnicity i guess , dunno whether they still consider themselves as ethnic germans ) really took hold after wwii . 
  they described themselves as ` deutsch ' as well . 
  on the other hand , croatia and serbia were well established since the middle ages . 
  what you linked is from 1954 , we already had second yugoslavia by then . 
  the languages were artificially made closer , purely because of politics . 
  so it 's always silly to me when people today 's perceived divergence chalk up to politics and brush it off because of that , when in reality it 's politics that got them ( the standards ) closer together . 
  not to mention it was mostly imposed through various institutions rather than voluntarily . 
  edit : i see you added 1850 as well which is correct ( 1854 still is n't ) , but the point still stands . 
  it was purely a political move . 
  can anyone clarify what falls and what does n't fall under local news ? 
  because a day or two ago i tried submitting [ this article ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pregnant-woman-loses-baby-racist-attack-kicked-in-stomach-a7253006.html ) and it was removed due to it being ` local news ' . 
  i do n't see how that 's different from this one , or any other that pops on / r/europe from time to time . 
  heh , you have a point there , it 's all about plausible deniability . 
  still though , i think snapchat gives a lot of people a fake sense of security/untouchability , which it absolutely does not . 
  it 's better than `` permanent '' messages , but an average joe is still a google search away from finding an easy way to circumvent snapchat 's `` advantages '' . 
  there are 3rd party tools that allow for saving ( and looking at ) pictures no matter what timer you put on , as long as it 's under 24 hours from when the picture was received afaik , and you wo n't even get a message they saved it . 
  you should still be careful despite thinking you took precautions , and not send something you would n't want ending up stored on someone 's phone unless you completely trust them . 
  you do n't remember his comments on / r/croatia ? 
  or on / r/europe about croats ? 
  just search through his history a bit . 
  to me it seems there 's some [ projecting going on ] ( https://web.archive.org/web/20160916072823/https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4lgxk3/eu_as_one_nation/d3ntsfr?context=3 ) . 
  someone has to elect those politicians ( so do we ) , and their international politics were pretty consistent for the last 20 years ( that i ca n't say for us ) .
