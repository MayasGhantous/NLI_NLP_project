  so , i reckon there 's support for this , you should just check slovenian news sites . 
  they have problems with what their politicians do domestically , not how they handle things internationally .

  til some church papers equals to whole nation , you 'd fit right in with the guardian journalism . 
  oh my , you indeed have your knickers in a twist . 
  no one denied that romania cooperates with v4 , lots of countries cooperate with them through that framework ( croatia too ) . 
  what i linked just had more relevance to the topic at hand since those are the words from the same person that prompted this whole post and discussion , and it explicitly mentioned an union inside an union . 
  besides , romania has that [ craiova group ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/craiova_group ) going on for it . 
   but hey , maybe that dodgy boomerang you call croatia is really special . 
  i wonder how did we survive before you joined eu to tell us what we can . 
  pray tell , i wonder myself as well - how did you ? 
  it was not really a suggestion but rather some joking , both of the comments you latched onto were in jest . 
  i thought your first comment was in jest as well but now i 'm not so sure . 
  regardless :  while you 're as out of it as we are ( if not even more ) [ actually ] ( http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-29/austria-populists-soften-eu-stance-as-brexit-shapes-campaigning ) , there 's a mention or two :  to gain more influence over eu policy , austria should form a `` union within the union '' together with slovenia , croatia , the czech republic and hungary , hofer said . 
  the alliance of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -- the benelux countries -- shows that small nations can increase their power if they cooperate , he said . 
   maybe it 's a good idea to cut short this cockiness . . because romania is arguably of higher strategic importance for v4 ( existing gas pipes , transport corridors , seaport ... ) and therefore probably has a higher chance of ever `` joining v4 '' than croatia . 
  i know you were just * butthurt * by his comments , but i still feel like i need to correct you on this one , because croatia was historically pretty important to austria/hungary/whateverthenamewasatthetime as the southern end of central europe with quite a nice access to adriatic sea . 
  pula was the main port for the navy and rijeka was a port of utmost importance to hungary ( which is why we had some not so nice things like ` rije\u010dka krpica ' ) . 
  today , it 's not that important due to negligence , trieste and koper stole a good chunk of its transport , but with proper care and investing it could be brought up to speed again to everyone 's benefit . 
  also , as far as energy supply goes , croatia has a better position to provide for central europe , since to the north we can cover most of central europe with very little pipe mileage and even easily connect it to the baltic lng terminals . 
  there were already talks and plans for krk lng terminal which would do this , and were encouraged by americans ( especially during the ukraine crisis ) in order to diversify european energy suppliers . 
  also , if you look up the historical inspiration of visegrad group , you 'll notice that charles i of hungary has also had the title of king of croatia , so we were there in the beginning . 
   hofer . 
   zeman built his campaign on slamming those filthy foreigners there 's your link . 
  what a trainwreck of an article . 
  it 's an ` opinion piece ' all right . 
  no , the red square was in power when we joined the eu and we also applied for membership during their governance ( in 2003 ) . 
  however , the negotiations were handled and brought to an end in 2011 by the blue square . 
  both parties had joining eu as their goal . 
  no , they 've been here since the 90 's , yellow and burgundy squares are new . 
  the purple one is a new political party , but it 's made of veteran politicians , so we ca n't really call it something new . 
   did any fellow croatians ? 
  no , that 's just sensationalistic bbc for you . 
  they had some bs ` article ' about these elections a few days ago as well , you can check it if you 're in for a wtf . 
  but [ unlike blizzard ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wrw3c2njee ) , i doubt they ever said it out loud .

  awful news , but france seems like a warzone lately . 
  or not , because at least you 'd know to avoid one , and these attacks happen relatively randomly so you ca n't really avoid , it 's just a matter of luck to not be there . 
  plus croatians have eu passports . 
  they started trouble hoping it would force the referee to stop and cancel the game , so czech republic would be handed a 3-0 win afterwards . 
  and of course , the inevitable fines for croatian fa .

  it 's not just legislation , it 's a mixture of everything :  we rank the countries on the basis of laws and policies that have a direct impact on the lgbti people 's human rights in under 6 categories : equality and non-discrimination ; family ; bias motivated speech/violence ; legal gender recognition ; freedom of assembly , association and expression ; and asylum . 
  if you wish to look for legislation , [ this index ] ( https://rainbow-europe.org/ ) has a good breakdown for each european country regarding lbgt rights . 
  our president [ managed to sneak into top 50 ] ( http://www.forbes.com/profile/kolinda-grabar-kitarovi263/?list=power-women ) as well . 
  croatia did n't , because it is n't a legal successor to independent state of croatia , but to [ socialist republic of croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_republic_of_croatia ) , which itself is legal successor to pre-wwii kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  unlike serbia , who in fact is the legal successor of 90 's yugoslavia . 
  besides , [ world war ii reparations to yugoslavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_war_ii_reparations_towards_yugoslavia ) were handled by germany . 
  took you long enough to mention wwii though . 
  honestly , that 's not even that much of a problem here . 
  what 's more concering is this :  serbia must first scrap its law on universal jurisdiction in war crimes cases committed in the former yugoslavia that 's like germany having a law on universal jurisdiction in war crime cases committed in the third reich . 
  i honestly do n't understand what eu is thinking here because it goes against their legislation , but it 's not like i was too hopeful about eu to begin with . 
  gajica is croatian tho . 
  these exact maps have been posted hundred times already , we do n't need a video of it as well . 
  i 've only ever saw it on reddit . 
  i do n't remember any isis inspired attacks . 
  actually the only islamic terrorist attack i recall in recent history is [ 1995 rijeka bombing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_rijeka_bombing ) . 
  maybe they wanted to put it in bosnia , but that 's some ** really ** shitty positioning then . 
  yeah , it 's not a big deal . 
  nothing to worry about . 
   the word spritzen means to splash . 
  it 's kinda the same in croatian --  \u0161pricati, 
  i 'll have you know it 's called ** gemi\u0161t ** and it 's a croatian national drink !, 
  austria lost the austro-prussian war and therefore prussia led the unification of germany . 
  austria was n't too happy about that ( they wanted to be the leader ) so they backed out . 
  familija can also be derogatory , hinting that it 's a family of troublemakers who stick together ( a mob ) . 
  it stems from not so legal * italian family bussinneses * . 
  just came here to say this , i do n't know where he got that from . 
  dru\u017eba and dru\u017eina have the same meaning in croatian tho , but unless he 's croatian i have no idea how he 'd mix them up . 
  because it is . 
   do males commit suicide twice as much in poland compared to germany or are females just less suicidal ? 
  none of that . 
  it 's just a male to female suicides ratio i.e. 
  how many men commit suicide for every woman 's suicide . 
  i 'll make up these numbers just to illustrate my point : male suicides / female suicides poland = 400 / 50 germany = 3 500 000 / 1 000 00 once again , i exaggerated some numbers just so it 's easier to understand , do n't take these numbers as facts . 
  from these you can see that germany males commit suicide a lot more than twice as much compared to poland . 
  you can also read into it as women being more suicidal since a bigger number of women out of the female ( or total if you wish ) population kill themselves . 
  so , the map is just what it says . 
  there 's not much beyond that and there 's no point in trying to read into it too much and come with conclusions like those two of yours .

  if i remember correctly , they rotate as well so they do n't accidentally miss a spot . 
  scots replaced jews as the stingy ones because jews being the butt of the joke was a bit inappropriate after wwii . 
  how else would you easily tow a mig through city ? 
  where are those from , and what was the occassion ? 
  but since we 're on the topic of nudity , i think it 's suitable to mention tomislav gotovac and his perfomance * `` le\u017eanje gol na asfaltu , ljubljenje asfalta ( zagreb , volim te ! ) '' * . 
  basically , it consisted of walking naked around the city centre , lying on the concrete and kissing it while shouting `` zagreb , i love you '' . 
  [ here ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=tomislav+gotovac+performans+volim+zagreb&amp;client=firefox-b&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1067&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjh5qsp4j_sahubpxqkhffwb0mq_auibigb ) are some pics ( nsfw , of course ) . 
  of course , there were more to come , such as [ these ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/ritam-grada/potpuno-goli-lezali-na-zagrebackom-cvjetnom-trgu-960801 ) from not so long ago . 
  they were returning the mig to base after the public military expo that was held that day on jarun . 
  what 's so difficult to comprehend about that ?
