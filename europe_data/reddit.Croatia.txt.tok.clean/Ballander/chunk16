  if one is a hooligan , it 's not much of a stretch to assume he 's a nazi . 
  people do profit off of that . 
  you use that as a compliment , not an insult . 
  5 more seats when ? 
  a [ video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvto0opuqwk ) from last year . 
  2016 never sleeps . 
  nah , you did n't . 
  i just wanted to add that we were with hungary for even longer . 
  we were in a personal union with hungarians for almost a millenium . 
  nah , its pejorative use extends to far more countries than croatia . 
  in some countries , it even has racist undertones as it 's used by racists completely ignorant of the perceived area . 
  it has nothing to do with being slavs , just not welcoming racists like kaplan who would trudge about ancient hatreds and engage in grade-a orientalism when they actually have no idea what they are talking about . 
  not having 2d waifus in 2017 smh, 
  i can get behind this map . 
  not really . 
  balkans are a very nebulous term and there is no clear definition , which is why there 's a few countries arguing whether they belong there or not . 
  some even argue it 's not a geographical term because it does n't meet criteria of what is a peninsula . 
  are you saying iraqis are incapable of runni ng their country ? 
  especially after they fought tooth and nails to retake mosul ? 
  wtf , fk off , they 're people too . 
  people she hurt . 
  just because she was a lackey , it does n't she did n't kill people . 
  iraqi police is certainly more qualified to conduct an investigation on their soil rather than germany . 
  germany does n't have jurisdiction over crimes commited in iraq . 
  what info ? 
  she was a lackey enforcing sharia law , not someone handling the logistics of terrorist operations . 
  she is no more of use than any other random terrorist would be , yet i do n't see people calling for getting them all here to provide info . 
   i mean , when an adult male terrorist in europe , say the uk or germany , kills people in a terror attack , do they get the death penalty ? 
  never . 
  they do n't get the death penalty because there is no death penalty in europe , unlike in iraq which this girl terrorised . 
  but rest assured many people would still cheer for handing out death penalties or worse to terrorists in europe . 
  plenty of people were pissed with breivik and how lenient his punishment is ( despite it being prison for life in practice ) . 
   running across a highway this is where i 'd draw the line . 
   how would one survive that ? 
  it 's a constant stream of oncoming vehicles at very high speed . 
  maybe it 's less crowded at 4 a.m. 
   anyone with internet can research their jolly habits of beheading people with a knife or burning them in a cage . 
  they actually post real well-shot execution video with a high production value as adverts . 
  they do that as how they present themselves . 
  they 're out and about with the extreme violence and if you 're willing to fly over 10 countries to join that , than you can go to hell . 
  actually , new york was created by dutch colonialists and was first called new amsterdam . 
  only after the british conquered it was it called new york after the duke of york . 
  he meant lowest approval for the decision to not take any . 
  bar the countries with significant we also have the highest percentage of people who would take them all in . 
  but those percentages are kind of low . 
  really fucking rich coming from someone whose country is leading in * negative opinion * of migrants . 
  whereas croatia is actually leading in * positive opinion * in cee . 
  slovakia ( and to that extent your government ) is participating in three seas initiative . 
  there is still a clear split here . 
  in such threads , there 's more of comments ( shitposts ) like his than some serious fights . 
  and acting like setting the record straight in a civil manner when some people dish out inaccurate info and even downright propaganda in some cases is some kind of a `` trainwreck '' or something hilarious worth grabbing popcorns over is disguisting . 
  some stuff is serious and shit happens exactly because people treat it like a meme . 
  namecalling and some low-blows happen , but not any more than on any other thread . 
  certainly not enough to warrant a few `` grabbing popcorns '' posts even before there any comments discussing the topic at hand . 
  shit , you should 've seen threads regarding germany and greece in 2015 . 
  such comments are both unoriginal , unfunny and do n't add anything to discussion . 
  rather take it into consideration and work on yourself . 
  no resumee will help if you 're a mindless parroting shitposter . 
  what an original comment , very funny and insightful as well . 
  yes , this round of sanctions was pushed by democrats . 
  she was n't . 
  savka dabcevic-kucar took office and was head of government in 1967 . 
  [ savka dabcevic kucar ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/savka_dab%c4%8devi%c4%87-ku%c4%8dar?wprov=sfla1 ) ( 1967 ) was actually our first female premier . 
  our current president is also a woman . 
  did you even bother with looking up croatia ? 
  in slovak , it 's * slovensko * for ** slovakia ** and * slovinsko * for ** slovenia ** . 
  now , that is next level . 
  it 'd be so funny if this was the case in more languages . 
  ca n't imagine the confusion it would produce given the current state of affairs . 
  this year , it 's coming home !, 
  at least they tryhard at doing commercials for super bowl . 
  it 's popular in croatia when we are winning . 
  hmm , like any other sport . 
  lufti\u0107 is diminutive and shorthand for luftmadrac . 
  it was an answer to the most recent [ uber protest ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/news/20757-uber-protest-taxis-block-roads-in-zagreb-split-and-dubrovnik ) in croatia . 
   dubrovnik taxi drivers are currently blocking the highway in direction from airport towards the city , as well in the reverse direction at alternate locations , protesting against uber , and the result is absolute chaos . 
  dubrovnik 's mayor mato frankovi\u0107 has issued a statement warning the taxi drivers to end their protest for the good of the city and its guests . 
  i really liked the zagreb picture , thought about posting it . 
  it was raining cats and dogs . 
  not even thunderstorms ? 
  we had those for the last few days . 
  volkswagen beetle has such an iconic design . 
  i even fancy the new models . 
  bmw isetta is also too cute . 
  here 's the quote from the [ article ] ( https://euobserver.com/energy/131605 ) :  hungarian pm viktor orban noted that nord stream ii has strategic implications . 
   if it 's built , russia can bypass ukraine , costing it billions a year in transit fees . 
  it can also cut gas supplies to former iron curtain states more easily . 
   nord stream ii `` is related to ukraine , and south stream , and double standards , '' orban told press . 
  he said it 's `` even more complicated than the migrant question , '' the summit 's main topic . 
   he said he wants to hear a `` reasonable argument why south stream is bad and north stream is acceptable . '' it 's a multi-layered problem . 
  that deal benefits no one but germany and russia . 
  so much about the famed solidarity . 
   how is that so hard to understand ? 
  money  everything ditch the condensending attitude , especially since your reply has nothing to do with my comment . 
  i said italy and hungary opposed it , i did n't say anything about their reasons . 
  the intention of sanctions is not to destroy their economy , but to apply pressure that can enact a change in russia 's policy . 
  going ahead with ns2 is opposite of that . 
  it 's because russia does n't just sell gas , it uses it as a geopolitical instrument . 
  it 's unethical to talk about solidarity because ns2 allows russia to have a stronger leverage on ee . 
  it 's not pure bussiness .
