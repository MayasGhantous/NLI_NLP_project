  mentality like this is why you do n't put all eggs into one basket . 
  ns2 will just make it easier to limit the supply of gas to ee without affecting trade and supplying of we . 
  poland is complaining because with ns2 russia can easily close the pipe for eastern europe without affecting their supply to western europe . 
  it gives russia a big strategical advantage and makes it much easier to bully ee countries . 
  then you know very little because even renzi and orban criticised ns2 and questioned its special treatment as opposed to south stream . 
  that phrase is just a figure of speech . 
  it was just looking for something to be outraged about . 
  lactose intolerant people know better than buying foods containing dairy products . 
  besides voting with your wallets , voicing criticisms and concerns is also a thing . 
  you need to point out why you would n't bother buying their product so they could work on that and hopefully win you over . 
  this case is also extremely anti-consumer as it actively misleads people . 
  they 're selling butter cookies with no butter in it . 
  it 's not just food industry . 
  detergents and , to lesser extent , other cleaning products are also notorious for this . 
  butter is by far the healthiest of the three , if you must pick . 
  but remember lower quality products for eastern markets is just a giant conspiracy !, 
  or it 's just adjusting to eastern taste buds not accustomed to butter in ** butter ** cookies . 
  it 's anyone 's guess . 
  it could just be pyromania or some other sadist disorder . 
  believing the fires were started unintentionally is n't too far fetched as it happens . 
  but this would definitely be the most severe case of it . 
  italy and sssr were totalitarian as well . 
  it would have made much more sense to group these three together rather than singling out germany and sssr separately . 
  singling out nazis from other authoritarian regimes is dumb because you 're making a new group for a single country , and it 's in essence subgroup of authoritarian regimes . 
  it would have made much more sense to group italy , germany and sssr into ** totalitarian ** regimes . 
  / u/andrijas provided a good answer , but this is the most important point / difference :  finally croatia , slovenia , bosnia , etc. . . were recognized as independent countries ( after they declared independence ) , so it could not have been a civil war as any military force on their soil was actually an invasion army . 
  there was no federal system when the war started . 
  countries were recognized and admitted to un . 
   finally croatia , slovenia , bosnia , etc. . . were recognized as independent countries ( after they declared independence ) , so it could not have been a civil war as any military force on their soil was actually an invasion army . 
  this ca n't be overstated . 
  eh , when their national motto is `` hrvat je tat '' ( croat is a thief ) i do n't hold much hope . 
  just remember the snide [ comments ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/globus/globus-komentari/zasto-slovenija-vodi-sovinisticki-rat-protiv-hrvatske-socijaldemokrati-su-im-postali-vodeca-nacionalisticka-stranka-gora-i-od-desnih-nacionalista/5846399/ ) from their vice-president of national council . 
  i ca n't imagine any politician in croatia uttering such chauvinistic nonsense . 
  especially not from none other but vice-president of sabor !, 
  you should check out their sites . 
  i believe he was mainly referencing this [ croatian banovina ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/banovina_hrvatska_kotari.jpg ) . 
  i 'd call him an illiterate troll first and foremost . 
  i just do n't think it 's relevant to point out he 's from serbia since you can find slovenians that hold such opinions or are chauvinistic pretty easily . 
  stall us how ? 
  will they send their mighty navy to the construction site ? 
  nothing will come out of this . 
  eu already granted 375 million euros and plans and studies were made . 
  bosnia 's late to the party . 
  they can drum up panic in their country and maybe score some political points internally , but it wo n't be anything significant internationally . 
  but he 's still slovenian , and i do n't doubt he 's from ljubljana . 
  and why do they expect to get it ? 
  only reason we ever agreed to that arbitration process was because slovenia blackmailed us . 
  they stopped the eu negotiations ( for 2 years ) until we agreed to arbitration . 
  luckily , slovenes were caught red-handed and that gave us grounds to terminate the process . 
  that was a one-off . 
  bih can always try their luck with international courts . 
  but they should know slovenes avoided that because they knew their case would n't fly there . 
  would you mind telling which website you used ? 
  it 's a clean map . 
  imagine the shock , croatia has border issues with every former-yugoslav neighbour . 
  just like slovenia . 
  to me it seems they probably just took hundreds and thousandths from the index , ignoring 0.8 . 
  and it 's older data . 
  that 's quite misleading . 
  i 'm not exactly sure how they approached it because it wildly differs from [ hdi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_development_index ) . 
  they probably just took hundreds and thousandths from the index , ignoring 0.8 . 
  that makes it quite misleading . 
  that 's all fine and dandy , and i do n't think anyone is excusing him . 
  what is not fine is using him , a single case - there was n't anyone else with him that could lead us to think it was organized , as some sort of proof of a trend in all of europe . 
  the only problem is you equating a drunkard with people , you just did that in this comment as well . 
  in your original comment , you somehow thought this ** person 's ** behaviour is indicative of europe . 
  who knows what was going through this ** person 's ** mind . 
  you do n't think there are drunkards on cultural festivals ? 
  because this one is one of the biggest of its kind in croatia . 
  tbh , you 're unabashedly ignorant . 
  croatia for the most part was part of austrian empire/habsburgh monarchy . 
  some parts of croatia and hungary were under ottoman occupation , but they were liberated in 1700s . 
  man , it 's a half-naked drunkard ripping a flag from pole , and others promptly reacted . 
  i do n't remember any incident like that , this is probably a first . 
  do you really want to use this man as an example of how people from slavonia think ? 
  a half-naked drunkard ripping a flag from a pole is indeed a great indication of big nazi/racist hatred circulating in europe !, 
   argumentum ad hominem , is now usually understood as a logical fallacy in which an argument is rebutted by attacking the character , motive , or other attribute of the person making the argument , or persons associated with the argument , rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself in what way did he personally attack you ? 
  do you know what ad-hominem is ? 
  it 's not that . 
   cars are more evil than clotges tho holy shit , they actually believe cars are evil . 
  some [ footage ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4b-s52yv7u ) of the test car . 
  a [ pic ] ( http://www.croatiaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cro.jpg ) . 
  both can be found inside the article . 
  a bit more detailed [ article ] ( http://www.osijek031.com/osijek.php?topic_id=68133 ) , but in croatian . 
  there 's a few more pictures of the vehicle itself there . 
  it will certainly help to get a better grasp of its looks if it 's not that clear from the above sources . 
  the design reminds me of [ pedalo ] ( http://www.njuskalo.hr/image-bigger/ostala-plovila/pedalina-capri-4-slika-63737524.jpg ) a lot . 
  i love the smell of hamburger in the morning !, 
  ah yes , g20 and cars - the hotbed of fascism !, 
  hamburg just picked the crown from split . 
  it looks like an urban warzone . 
  the first official meeting was a year ago in dubrovnik . 
  before that , it was known as adriatic-baltic initiative and was focused on securing energy independence for central europe ( lng on baltic sea , one in croatia and then connect them ) . 
  later it was expanded to bulgaria and romania since they were probably interested and it geopolitically made sense . 
  they were shafted when south stream did n't come to fruition . 
  so , a year ago first `` three sees initiative '' meeting was held . 
  i do n't know if greece is interested . 
  but turkey is quite a big and populous country bordering numerous countries , some of which are in war . 
  it also has an almost dictator like figurehead and very low freedoms ( namely of press and free speech i.e. 
  opposing the leadership ) .
