  it seems i was misunderstood . 
  did n't mean that the kid did it , just that he was trying to get credit for it in order to get some publicity . 
  the statutes of scotland and croatia ** today ** are not comparable ( uk is here , but there 's no yugoslavia ) , so unless you 're up for some nonsense banter , better not try to make a point out of it . 
  what would be a bit more interesting ( and comparable ) is whether you consider croatia from 1943-1990 ( as part of yugoslavia ) as a country . 
  that 's something you could compare today 's situation of scotland to . 
  croatia 's official language is croatian , so not comparable in a way you 'd like . 
  also , croatian is an official eu language . 
  not serbo-croatian or any other stuff people come up with , but croatian . 
  t-com incompetent as usual . 
  as far as kunanetw0rk is concerned , he just said it was his doing , there 's nothing else pointing to a hacker attack . 
  it 's probably just some kid trying to have his 5 minutes in the spotlight . 
  that 's the most recent stance . 
  source ? 
  cause croatia agreed to that , the map seems incorrect . 
  i 've replied to / u/pepperboon , but it might interest you as well . 
  i googled and found only [ this ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/vlada-ima-i-plan-c-ako-madari-zatvore-granicu-izbjeglice-ce-im-stizati-stihijski-1025789 ) , no mention anywhere else ( i 've watched the news too ) . 
  the part your media reffered to :  ** neslu\u017ebeno ** doznajemo da vlada ima rezervni plan i za to . 
  neslu\u017ebeno = unofficial did hungarian press state it 's unofficial ? 
  usually it 's important when covering news , especially when only one news outlet said it . 
  apart from that , the translation is fine . 
  source ? 
  because all i see is one news outlet claiming they got the info on alleged plan c from unofficial sources . 
  and that does n't mean much . 
  no one mentioned it . 
  i was just curious what was your definition . 
  why so ? 
  what would be your definition ? 
  2/10 not dank enough, 
  just look at all the border controls that were reintroduced inside schengen , even netherlands is considering it . 
   schengen is dead and not by croatia 's doing we 're not even in it , how could it be our doing ? 
  a nice little story , but it does n't have anything to do with my reply . 
  we would n't join it anyways , it 's dead now . 
  not at all , we have best relations with hungary out of all our neighbours ( not much of an achievement though ) . 
  he wo n't fish votes on that , actually a good chunk of people detest his attitude towards hungary . 
  one of the deminers died a few days ago , another one is seriously injured . 
   officials in croatia are now expecting that as many as 4,000 migrants might enter their country in the coming days [ as many as 7300 migrants already entered before noon . 
  ] ( http://www.mup.hr/219671.aspx ), 
  from the croatian ministry of internal affairs . 
  he was also yelling : `` i 'll kill you all '' . 
  i agree croatia being labeled stuff is not a problem considering how often and pointlessly these labels are used . 
  and what exaggerations are done , but you were talking about people and you 're most certainly wrong with this one :  people here will actually take that as a compliment no sane person will take it as a compliement . 
  no , they wo n't wtf ... 
  they probably think croatia and hungary are some places somewhere in asia , bordering turkey , and not almost in their backyard . 
  ah , i was unsure , so i went with better safe than sorry . 
  serious question ? 
  no we 're not , and tennis is not that big either . 
  we made it to the frontcover too , yay !, 
   mpassable fence in hungary , ** serbia ** is on the route you mean croatia ? 
  maybe , but it will be a lot more inconvenient than just passing through hungary . 
  the fence is not there yet . 
  but serbia is on their route , just like macedonia and others . 
  croatia is n't . 
  i find the stick laughable . 
  no one is arguing about selfies ffs , but the stick . 
  i did n't imply anything , i just pointed out that smartphones is not what 's odd in the picture , but the selfie stick . 
  it was your question . 
   and even if they did , so what ? 
  it 's weird that some people fleeing from a war would take something as frivolous and pointless as a selfie stick , i 'm sure there are much more important items to carry . 
  not smatphones , but selfie stick . 
  it 's not a necessity , and it 's probably the last thing someone running for his life would take . 
   a lack of variety in people what do you think by this ? 
  joe biden 's son na aparatih ? 
  it 's a fucking dumb comparison if you 're trying to win people over for your cause . 
  lol , this just shows how freely `` nazi '' is being thrown around these days . 
  you can call kajin a lot of things , but nazi is not one of them . 
  though he preached about `` muh multiculturalism '' for a long time , so you could call him a hypocrite considering his statement . 
  ah , i just know you 're waiting for me to hand you '' \\ '' over, 
  what an irrelevant load of bs . 
  the blue color is nicer anyways . 
  nicely done , though that 's not the colour of the dutch flag . 
  the colouring is nothing short of amazing . 
   in the first seven months of last year , 516 illegal entries into croatia from serbia were recorded , while this year that number was 118 which is a drop of 77 % . 
  the numbers were n't that big to begin with , but it 's still a big drop by percentage . 
   the police are monitoring the global situation and analysing any possible implications and are prepared for any possible threats so as to redirect human and technical resources , if necessary , according to the police statement . 
  supervision of the european union 's external borders has been intensified with maximum police efforts to protect the state border , particularly along possible transit routes used for illegal crossings and smuggling . 
  a `` croatian '' name . 
  niko can just as well be short from `` nikola '' which is used in a lot of slavic countries . 
  the port of their disembarkment will be determined later , but the 305 migrants that were rescued in the morning were taken to sicily . 
  interestingly enough , all of the comments on the article are from within 24 hours . 
  lol , some were late . 
  edit : it was posted in / r/mensrights a day ago, 
  yeah , they were secretive , but from the little hints it obvious he 's from serbia . 
  also , his outfit was never popular in croatia , but serbia had bunch of tracksuit gangsters in the 90s . 
  no , he was n't . 
  is this youtube ? 
  edit : originally , the comment just said `` first '' . 
  it was edited since then . 
  / r/europe mods though , i 've read this about them on several occassions and judging by their behaviour on some topics ( unexplained removing and nuking of threads ) it 's probably not too far from truth . 
   mods are people , too , you can talk to them if you 're thinking of mod mail , it 's kind of a no-no . 
  a good amount of people complained about them not responding to their questions . 
  paging both of you : / u/lalegatorbg , / u/mewkazami there you go . 
  sorry , i must have missed it . 
  i wo n't , do n't know about you . 
  lalagatorbg was just spreading misinformations/lies , which mewkazami `` combated '' with facts that can be easily checked . 
  there was no nosensical arguing on his part . 
  there 's a difference between nonsensical arguing and calling out on pure bullshit . 
  the first one was about slovenia some time ago ( more than a year ago ) and was in lieu of tourist advertisements . 
  the uk one was the first that acted as a joke . 
  there is always version 2.0 ( \u00b0 \u0296 \u00b0 ), 
   polish death camps triggerd .
