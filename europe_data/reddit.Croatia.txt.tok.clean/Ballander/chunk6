  apparently , it 's a witch-hunt orchestrated by bosniaks , croats and dutch opening multiple accounts to diss him , lol . 
  a better starting point would be [ this ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/37uf10/mod_post_announcing_some_more_new_moderators/crpxube ) . 
  dank memes ^ tm if you 'd be fine with a neonazi ( or a bigot in general ) as a moderator , then your sentiment is understandable . 
  otherwise it 's just hypocritical and biased . 
  why ? 
  just look at the modlist here . 
  unfortunately , this is becoming/r/european , there 's no point in talking about leaking . 
  this one is deleted as well . 
  for the amount of votes the party gets , it is heavily overrepresented when it comes to number of minister positions they get . 
  fwiw , we had 250 000 tourists from south korea last year , that 's a massive increase compared to just a few years ago . 
  they even opened a hostel in zagreb specifically geared towards koreans . 
   ( assuming `` khm '' means `` ahem '' ) you 're right !, 
  parese ? 
  thank you , sounds about right . 
   there is n't a single eastern european country that has a net surplus in contributions !, 
  khm , khm ... 
  as usual , we 're neither here nor there . 
  but i believe we 're in the net contributors , by a very small margin . 
  hehe , i did n't see it until now , but at least you got an answer . 
   so , is there no difference between `` y '' and `` i '' in slovak ? 
  that 's how i feel about \u010d / \u0107 , ije/je and d\u017e / \u0111 in croatian . 
  can confirm , it 's `` dansko pecivo '' in croatian . 
  it 's \u0161vedski stol ( swedish table ) in croatian as well , it might be like this everywhere . 
  thank you for the answer . 
  it is interchangeable in croatia , it 's just that `` ugarska '' could be considered an arhaism and is n't in use anymore . 
  but when talking about history ( history lessons ) , people will freely use ugarska and ma\u0111arska as synonims . 
  do you prefer `` ugarska '' ( hungary ) or `` ma\u0111arska '' ( magyaria ? ) ? 
  what 's the difference between the two ? 
  you see he 's literally dying here . 
  guess what [ this song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyhweu-qasg ) is about . 
   croatia - herzegovina not really . 
  if anything , it would bring the percentage down . 
  people in croatia are n't too fond of bosnian croats . 
  [ the marriage law is n't ignored though . 
  ] ( http://ilga.websiteprojects.com/sites/default/files/croatia_-_annual_review_2015.pdf ) i think it 's also all the other little things in the breakdown . 
  it seems there is no prioritizing . 
  edit : [ here 's by countries ] ( http://rainbow-europe.org/ ) if you 're interested in what exactly are they counting . 
  just click on the country and there should be a breakdown . 
  he 's joking , that 's just two drunks doing , hmmm , some things . 
   i ca n't believe that you are trying to excuse a statement like that . 
  indeed , the argument is over . 
  i ca n't believe i got in an argument with a far-right serb over a statement from a far-right politician . 
   i think it is a good translation , but `` certain '' can do as well , since it is also non particular actually and still referes to serbs in general , you know how our language works . 
  no , it does n't work like that . 
  these serbs = ovi srbi certain serbs = pojedini srbi the first refers to an entire ethnicity , while the second to some of them . 
  she did n't meant to characterize an ethnicity . 
   i did n't say they celebrated it because of ethnic cleansing quote from you : * while in croatia the actions which lead to ethnic cleansing of serbs are considered a victory and are celebrated . 
  * that means pretty much that . 
   i did n't build my ` narrative ' around that . 
  i 'll change it if you want . 
  there was n't any bias , i only translated what was said . 
  your narrative was based around an entire ethnicity , while she mentioned * pojedini * . 
  however , what i meant by narrative was your talk about this getting no coverage in croatia and that no one was convicted for crimes during operation storm etc. , which is all false . 
  having her say all serbs instead certain just helps you in representing croats as `` evil ustashas '' or some shit . 
  her talk was n't appropriate and she 's pretty controversial , but what could you expect from a far-right politician reacting to dubious statements from serbia . 
  i do n't know why you 're getting downvoted . 
  as of 2012 , [ 2380 persons were convicted for crimes during and after operation storm ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/zbog-zlocina-tijekom-oluje-i-nakon-nje-osudjeno-2380-osoba-479955 ) in croatia . 
  so the statemets made by serbian officials do n't really hold their ground . 
  the crimes are definitely looked into . 
   `` i 'm sick and tired of ** these ** serbs who are born in croatia , and they do n't care about croatia ( ah yes she identified them all , she is n't talking about a whole ethnicity at all ) . 
  they live at the expense of croatian citizens ( so she does n't consider them croatian citizens at all , and apparently croatians hand feed these serbs , they do n't work for their own bread at all ) , they traversed the world at the expense of croatia and they gave nothing back . 
  ( maybe the eu passport idk ) since when does * pojedini * translate to * these * ? 
  since never . 
  * pojedini * means * certain * and with that in mind the qoute looks different . 
  so no , she was n't talking about all the serbs in croatia , you just decided to twist/mistranslate her words to fit your narrative . 
  you built your narrative throughout your post upon this little , but significant mistranslation . 
  now , i do n't want to defend her , but your post reeks of malicious bias , from your input on how this statement was ignored in croatia to your listing of reasons why operation storm and others are celebrated as victory ( it 's because it meant the end of brutal 4 year war , not `` ethnic cleansing '' ) . 
  not at all . 
  you no ordnung ? 
  you can get cheap alcholic drinks from the market . 
  there 's also the combination of carbonated water and white wine , it 's called * gemi\u0161t * . 
  beer of course is widespread . 
  croatia has good wines , you could try looking for a winery . 
  that could , however , ramp up the price a bit . 
  croats from bosnia , plus the `` normal '' immigration ( people who get lost on their way to italy and some enthusiasts ) . 
  [ am i doing it right ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqlihraql7o ), 
   but there do exist a large population of russophiles ( mostly older ) i do n't know where you are getting this from . 
  croatia did n't really have much to do with russia in any time of history and their only link is that they 're both slavic . 
  so , croatians are indifferent , they are neither russophilic nor russophobic . 
  he was joking though . 
  edit : you may have been joking as well . 
  if you did , it flew over my head . 
  figured so since he was a politician . 
  did it pay off for them in czech republic ? 
  i 'm still not quite sure whether they 're for real . 
  it may be a publicity stunt . 
  in the end , someone will have to claim it , be it serbia or croatia after the border dispute is resolved . 
  `` have '' , i mean whatever country that will get this might leave them be , but i do n't know how probable that is . 
  ah , classic propaganda spinning , from a fascist to a defector . 
  there you go , a few pre-1943 quotes of his :  all men and all races are children of god ; all without distinction . 
  those who are gypsies , black , european , or aryan all have the same rights ( ... ) for this reason , the catholic church had always condemned , and continues to condemn , all injustice and all violence committed in the name of theories of class , race , or nationality . 
  it is not permissible to persecute gypsies or jews because they are thought to be an inferior race . 
   we affirm then that all peoples and races descend from god . 
  in fact , there exists but one race ... the members of this race can be white or black , they can be separated by oceans or live on the opposing poles , [ but ] they remain first and foremost the race created by god , according to the precepts of natural law and positive divine law as it is written in the hearts and minds of humans or revealed by jesus christ , the son of god , the sovereign of all peoples . 
  [ 47 ] from the linked article . 
  your assertion about 1943 holds no ground in facts . 
   aloysius stepinac , a guy who paraised the fascists in croatia during wwii . 
  [ there ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aloysius_stepinac ) you go . 
   * despite initially welcoming the independent state of croatia , stepinac subsequently condemned the nazi-aligned state 's atrocities against jews and serbs .
