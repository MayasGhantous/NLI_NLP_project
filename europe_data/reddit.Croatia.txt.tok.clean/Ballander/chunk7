  [ 5 ] he objected to the persecution of jews and nazi laws , helped jews and others to escape and criticized usta\u0161e atrocities in front of zagreb cathedral in 1943 . 
   handball ( close to 450k ) . 
  please , cut down on handball a bit . 
  said he from bosnia . 
  seriously , do n't speak in others ' name . 
  most of them are from zagreb , except this [ one ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/old-photos-same-locations-then-and-now-ognjen-ivanovic-croatia/?image_id=pula-arena__880.jpg ) and this [ one ] ( http://www.boredpanda.com/old-photos-same-locations-then-and-now-ognjen-ivanovic-croatia/?image_id=pula-forum__880.jpg ) . 
  i believe they 're both from pula . 
  i personally liked the stark contrast of this [ picture ] ( http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/trg-zima__880.jpg ) , the snowy blizzard of the past vs the sunny days of today . 
  lol , how did you get here ? 
   all the culture shocks when actually meeting americans i think it 's a bit of an exaggeration . 
  the biggest dividing factor would be their social system . 
  dok-ing is also developing electric cars named [ loox ] ( http://www.dok-ing.hr/products/automotive/loox ) . 
  these should be a bit more affordable to general public . 
   sdp = social democratic party huh , we got a party with the same name . 
  actually , they 're in charge now . 
   imo people in zagreb spoke kajkavian as the result of degermanization/pan-slavism started after national movements in 19 . century , together with anti-class movements in following century . 
  it 's not my opinion , kajkavian was always there . 
  germanization just came on top of it , pan-slavic people were more prone to shtokavian , but none of them were born shtokavians ( when we 're speaking of zagreb ) . 
  furthermore , even between pan-slavists there were disagreements about what dialect to choose and many opposed novoshtokavian . 
  this is incorrect . 
  kajkavian most definitely was not a * peasent * dialect . 
  it was spoken by everyone , and there were many noblemen ( zrinski for example , they even had * ozaljski knji\u017eevni krug * , which was on kajkavian ) . 
  ljudevit gaj first published his works on kajkavian , but then switched to shtokavian due to pan-slavism . 
  people in zagreb also spoke kajkavian , choosing herzegovinian shtokavian had more to do with pan-slavism . 
  now i want to try some , but it 's 3 a.m. - , -, 
  hm , i think \u0161trukli and fritule are something else . 
  we do have [ \u0161trudle ] ( http://i708.photobucket.com/albums/ww87/flavija/dsc02538_resize.jpg ) ( they can be with cheese , cherries , etc. 
  ) , but they are generally sweet ( the cherry one is kinda sour-sweet ) . 
  i tried it in southern germany . 
  it 's good , but i do prefer pizza ( heck , i prefer pizza to everything , haha ) .

  i was just joking . 
  no harm intended . 
  nice idea . 
  it would actually be interesting if / r/europe had more surveys ( and as sticky threads ) . 
  'cause we big , they irrelevant . 
  nice tips . 
  am i in danger if i 'd want to use flash while taking a few photos of them ? 
  i do n't know how * flash * sensitive they are . 
  but that whole episode with ustashas would have been avoided . 
  nah , slovenes ( yugos ) are really agressive and hostile . 
  the slovak did him a favour with this tip !, 
  we 're `` of '' ? 
  edit : haha , got it from other comments now . 
  we da great wall of china !, 
  it 's zagreb . 
  the scaffolding are here more than a decade now , i do n't honestly know what they 're doing . 
  but he was primarily talking about gotovina . 
  that was his point . 
   i guess it just gets filtered out at this point . 
   he kinda has a point . 
  could you be so kind to point out the point regarding gotovina ? 
  because after returning to croatia ( he was deemed innocent ) , he explicitly told people `` past is past and that we should look to future '' . 
  he secluded himself , got a fishing business going and never got involved in politics again . 
  he even helped out some illegal imigrants and gave them a job . 
  now , if all that makes him an ustasha/fascist . 
  well ... 
  even more hilarious are people comparing him to seselj . 
  no more gemi\u0161tek for you today !, 
  not a grand master plan , just hypocrisy and dishonesty . 
  it was just an example that could have been found on r/europe as well . 
  well , i tried to gauge the public opinion , somewhat . 
  obviously , people very fond of russia and anti-west are n't that few and far between . 
  i read some weird comments here as well , and that was n't coming from the samoserem/jedemslaninu/ramos trio . 
  i think it was from ` mrcavendish ' ( smthing like that ) , that one really baffled me . 
  i ca n't seem to find his account , but if it pops around here , i can try searching for the comment . 
  it was something along the lines of `` we got ta play pro-west to have approval for what comes next '' . 
  edit : i 'll have to correct myself , here 's the comment : https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2zmqp2/when_did_you_first_feel_european/cpkuhpb?context=3  smiri se bolan . 
  sad nam je vreme da cekamo u miri pa smiri se malo na r/europe  chill out , dude . 
  you sound like an extremist and the last thing we need is that europe thinks we 're still some small russian extremists . 
  there 's time for fighting and then there 's time for waiting in peace . 
  now is the time for waiting in peace , so chill out on r/europe . 
  would you also classify various commenters on different serbian sites as anti-serbs ? 
  what i 'm reading from him is exactly what i could 've read on b92 , which is supposed to be lefty . 
  some of them getting to reddit is n't a massive stretch of imagination , you ca n't downplay numbers of people with this sentiment . 
  however , this account probably is someone 's double . 
  napoleon also united italy , i 'd say both of these backfired for them . 
  damn , we were doing good . 
  :p fun fact , there 's sort of a [ statue ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/granica_ilirskih_pokrajina_zagreb.jpg/800px-granica_ilirskih_pokrajina_zagreb.jpg ) in zagreb that represents the borders between french ( illiryian province ) and austrian empire in that time . 
  pls , no yugos allowed . 
  if it makes you feel any better , i consider all of it turkish food . 
  hm , ordering from us is a mild annoyance , plus you got ta account for customs and pdv ( vat ) - i got ta agree on that . 
  where do you usually order from ? 
  i presume it 's the board games you order . 
   close contact of the whole upper body , basically rubbing nips - vs - light cheek-to-cheek touch . 
  but you 're wearing clothes so there 's no skin contact :p i 'm really not fond of hugs as well , it 's more of a `` if you insist thing '' . 
   a good internet connection , easily available boardgames , having no problems with international shipping ... and people actually respecting red lights . 
  never had a problem with what you listed . 
  where do you live ? 
  internet is `` just fine '' at worst in zagreb , perhaps you should check with your internet provider and look into the available options , and what infrastructure your building supports . 
  most international sites ship normally , i did n't have too many problems . 
  as for red lights , apart from some senile geezers ( they really stand out ) and assholes , they are pretty much respected . 
  granted , if there 's no traffic , people will cross it regardless . 
  as for board games , i do n't know if you 've heard of [ carta magica ] ( http://www.cartamagica.hr/ ) . 
  they 're relatively close to the centre . 
  you can get various board games in toy shops , but i figure this is what you 're looking for . 
  they also have magic tournaments , game nights and else what you 'd expect from a local game shop . 
  you should pay it a visit if that 's what you 're into . 
  so excessive . 
  what 's wrong with a handshake , or a hug ?
