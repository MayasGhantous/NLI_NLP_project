  most of the times you just nod at your friends and greet , hug maybe if you have n't seen them in a while and you 're really close . 
  ethnicity ! = nationality was what you were looking for , which he emphasized . 
   us was settled by western europeans not just western europeans , a sizeable amount of croatians ( for croatian standards ) emigrated to both of americas throughtout history as well . 
  but i did n't really want to dig into history much as croatia also had a long tradition of being in multinational european states . 
  i was more talking about younger generations and what came after croatian independence , america sort of left a mark and we 're a lot more exposed to american culture than some european , whatever people think it is . 
  nah , honestly , some history aside , i think a great chunk of croatians might be and feel closer to americans than europeans , especially considering how much of their stuff gets here . 
  granted some croatians will feel closer to europe and there 's a sizeable amount of just not caring . 
  he said good music . 
  they 're good . 
  there 's a lot of interesting stuff , i just realised i forgot elemental , tbf , dino dvornik , hladno pivo , ... pfft . 
  haha , i thought of adding it to the list , but i figured it would be an overload . 
  it 's great that there are lyrics on english too . 
  i like sigur ros from iceland , especially [ this track ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc6zxsdyxm8 ) and that album where they named their songs by number . 
  they did a good job on got !,

  perfect as it is , maybe we could get in that box on uk 's side , but that 's about it . 
  shush , or we 'll make a deal with italians !, 
  come to think of it , i wonder how people would react if someone posted wermacht songs here . 
  i doubt it would get to 20 upvotes and stay here for long . 
  i do n't , and i know plenty of people not caring for it . 
  luckily , we got only like 2 songs on this cancer list . 
  as soon as we ship off all the immigrants to you , we 're gone . 
  no , the other 140 millions of russians are thrilled that the slave/capita is so low . 
   i 'm not saying i expect everyone in croatia ( or in split ) to do things like that , but clearly some people really have some issues when it comes to anything ( perceived as ) serbian , which is what i do n't understand . 
  i simply can not fathom how anyone can see a serbian ( which it was n't , but let 's pretend it was . . ) shirt as something provocative in any way . 
  split is a bit rough around the edges , and like i said , you can be a croatian from zagreb in order to get a beating there , if you run into hooligans . 
  why can they perceive it as provocative ? 
  because they were probably drunk/drugged , which lowers their ability of rational thinking even lower . 
   hooligans in the football sense ? 
  no , they exist . 
  but your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we do n't tend to see in most other countries . 
  of course there are football rivalries here and sometimes a bunch of f.c. 
  copenhagen fans will get into a fight with br\u00f8ndby if fans or whatever . 
  look up videos of danish fans from poland-ukraine euro etc. 
  if you want to see what our fans are usually like . 
  they 're drinking , singing , partying and making a fool of themselves . 
  there 's a reason they 're called ` roligans ' and not hooligans . 
  ` rolig ' means calm in danish . 
  not calm in the `` we 're quiet '' sense , but in the peaceful sense . 
  `` my part of the world '' ... you 're free to try any extremist thing you think you can get away with in croatia , i assure you you wo n't have a nice time . 
   they 'll get banned from the stadiums , fined , potentially jailed and `` everyone '' will distance themselves from it . 
  the club , the fanclub , the `` fa '' etc. 
  it 's not an accepted thing at all . 
  even if both sides essentially agree to fight . 
  you think it 's accepted in croatia ? 
  wow , i wonder what kool-aid they feed you with in denmark . 
  reading between the lines , your perception of croatia was as it 's a religous , wildwest-like warzone . 
  wtf ? 
   but your part of the world is pretty darn infamous for ultras taking things to extremes we do n't tend to see in most other countries . 
  we do n't ? 
  what about the dutch trashing italian works of art ? 
  books have been written about the uk . 
  this is just generalizing and sweeping your problems under the rug . 
  the grass is not greener than in croatia . 
   it 's not just the picture though . 
  it 's news , it 's travel warnings , horrific pictures of someone of one nationality who 's been beatedn ( or worse ) by people of another nationality , it 's traveler stories , it 's comment sections on various sites i do n't know where you 're getting all this stuff from . 
  especially since most of it can be forged/faked ( you 'd be surprised how often i can come across mental gymnastics ) . 
  tourists who come here usually thoroughly enjoy it and crime rates are rather low , croatia is a very safe country . 
  lay off the youtube and site comments , in general . 
   well yeah , but that 's not where i saw it . 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/10/croatian-girl-kisses-serb_n_2839945.html lol , wow , i must admit i thought a tiny bit higher of huffington post , but this is just tabloid material at absolute worst . 
  they base their story around a picture and reddit user , without any further looking into it and trying to have some credible sources . 
  it 's basically like you saw it on reddit . 
  this is worrying because who knows what crap they could run on their site if they 're going to only go by the words of reddit users . 
  in this case , nothing bad happened other than bolstering of some stereotypes between foreigners . 
  i find english articles about croatia generally of poor quality , and often scarce and misleading . 
  for example , when there was the referendum about gay marriage ban , which was fairly covered , a lot of these sites were saying that 65 % of croatians voted for banning of gay marriage . 
  however , 65 % of those who went to vote voted for banning , and only 38 % of voter base went voting . 
  but of course this gets no mention . 
  this can be called propaganda since it wrongfully asserts that 65 % of croatians are against gays/gay marriages , while in reality the referendum would n't even pass if it were n't for the stupid goverment meddling with the referendum law before the eu referendum . 
  i also remember reading an economist article on croatian elections , where they used derogatory nicknames for the candidates ( which were used by common people in croatia ) , which is just a huge low for a media . 
  also , a lot of the articles can be very biased and filled with personal agenda rather than dealing with facts . 
  croatia does n't get reported on often , and when they do such crap job when they finally do report on it , i do n't know what to say . 
   no , i may have some media created assumptions , but how am i to get rid of them if not by asking the people who actually live there ? 
  if anyone can destroy the false assumptions and stereotypes surely it has to be the people in the region ? 
  drop the ` region ' and replace with ` croatia ' and i 'll agree , but otherwise no . 
  i always hated this collectivism regarding ex-yugoslavia , since it simply can not be under the same denominator . 
  there 's a reason it did n't work , the differences are there . 
  why should anyone from serbia or macedonia speak in my name or represent me in any way ? 
  unfortunately , it happens too many times . 
  something you may not be aware of , and that contributed to the dissolution of yugoslavia a lot was the economic factor . 
  slovenia and croatia had to give substantial money to the underdeveloped parts of yugoslavia ( the rest of it ) during the times of both yugoslavias and this is what annoyed most people . 
   while i find the crazies . . well , crazy . . 
  it does n't mean understanding where they 're coming from ca n't be interesting . 
  they can be coming from their personal problems and frustrations . 
   even if it 's in bosnia it does n't really change anything though it does , since i do n't want to deal with stereotypes about bosnia . 
  the ones about croatia are enough for me , thanks . 
   my view is n't distorted . 
  i do n't have a view . 
  some of the things you said sounded like straight out of polandball , you 're gon na have to forgive me , but there 's more than enough people forming their opinion of croatia based on some scarce stereotypes and having to go through them is rather annoying , which is why i may have sounded hostile . 
   the year of people wanting sharia law in europe , the year of isis , the year of boko haram , the year of people hanging gay people , the year of people preventing stem cell research , the year of people banning gay marriage because god says it 's `` ew ! '', 
  none of which ( aside from maybe banning gay marriage ) is happening `` down there '' . 
   so the recent topic about a tourist getting attacked because he worse a ( non-serbian ) eagle on his shirt is nonsense ? 
  or the fact that the police said it was his own fault for wearing it . . ? 
  could you link me this ? 
  there 's a difference between incidents ( and their frequency ) and general feeling . 
  for example , one could say a lot about norway if we 're gon na only look at breivik , but that would be utter bullshit , do n't you agree ? 
   i 'm not just blaming croatia though . 
  i was n't under impression that you were blaming croatia .
