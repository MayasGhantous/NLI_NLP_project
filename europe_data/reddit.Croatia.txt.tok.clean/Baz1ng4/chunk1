vazam can also be used . 
  it 's just for people apparently . 
  both words are in vocative . 
  and vocative is usually separated with a comma . 
  well , grammatical gender is not the same as the `` real '' one ( social construct ) , neither should it be equated with sex . 
  nouns that end with - chen or - lein are neuter nouns . 
  ** it 's endings that usually determine grammatical gender of nouns , not their referent . 
  ** m\u00e4dchen is a diminutive word form from magd ( which is of same origin as english maiden ) , and that word is in feminine . 
  in croatian there are also nouns that are masculine ( or even neuter ) , but they refer to a female person ( because of the endings/suffixes ) . 
  a child is usually neuter - even thought there is also a masculine noun - although it obviously has sex . 
  funny thing , in croatian a `` dead man '' is grammatically alive . 
  well , there are rules to determine the genders of nouns . 
  there are exceptions , of course , but a lot of these words are usually those you use often . 
  so english with correct pronunciation ? 
  does n/a stand for ` not antiseptic ' ? 
   balkan peninsula  [ here ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/balkan_topo_en.jpg ) how does that look like a peninsula ? 
   also the random `` e `` s in front of words starting with `` s '' ( estone ) . 
  he calls it spanglish . 
   i find this linguistic characteristic amazing . 
  adding an ` e ' before an 's ' applies to - i believe - all romance languages ( i know that it applies to spanish and french for sure ) . 
  the cause for this lies in the [ sonority ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sonority_hierarchy ) of sounds . 
  the `` rule/goal '' is to start each syllable with the least sonorous sound ( usually consonants ) , or with a vowel ( cause they have most sonority ) . 
  since 's ' is more sonorous than ` t ' , it break this pattern . 
  therefore , an 's ' was added to create a new syllable to follow this pattern consistently . 
  exactly that . 
  well , you know : christ , sins , sacrifice , resurrection , and all that . 
  i 'll use ipa transcription : \u017drt [ \u0292r\u0329t\u032a ] / \u017er\u0107 [ \u0292r\u0329t\u0361\u0255 ] . 
  here you can here each sound individually if you do n't know what these symbol represent : [ \u017e - \u0292 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:voiced_palato-alveolar_sibilant.ogg ) this is like french j , or g ( e/i ) , or like g in english word genre , s in vision ... [ r - r\u0329 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:alveolar_trill.ogg ) this is similar to spanish trill , it 's just that it 's syllabic , meaning that although a consonant , it has properties of a vowel . 
  [ \u0107 - t\u0361\u0255 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:voiceless_alveolo-palatal_affricate.ogg ) you sort of get this sound in english when you `` blend '' t and y together : whatya . 
  it 's like a softer version of english ` ch ' . 
  i think the closest sound you can find in french is the pronunciation of the name thierry . 
  [ t - t\u032a ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:voiceless_dental_stop.ogg ) this is pretty much straightforward , but it 's like french t , not english or german since it 's produced with upper teeth . 
  hope this helps . 
  yes , and therefore the ` sacrifice ' . 
  even altar is referred to as ' \u017ertvenik ' , the place where priest offers the sacrifice . 
  edit : i forgot to mention that i 'd found in some literary works older word form \u017ertje ( = \u017er\u0107e ) for \u017ertva . 
  that 's way i assumed that was the origin . 
  the croatian expatriate community in italy , so called [ molise croats ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molise_croats ) , have their own word ( s ) for wine : [ \u017ert / \u017er\u0107 ] ( https://hr.wiktionary.org/wiki/vino ) . 
  i am not 100 % sure about the etymology , but i would link this word to croatian/old church slavic word ' \u017ertva ' , meaning sacrifice . 
  it 's just a shame these words are n't in common usage . 
   a fellow dotes-playing linguist croatian that 's your tag now . 
   to me , the finnish [ \u028b ] ( as in that recording of vati ) sounds approx . 
  ** as much ** ** like ** [ v ] as it does [ w ] . 
  of course . 
  i 'm just saying it could maybe be easier to explain [ \u028b ] through [ v ] to someone who does n't know how to pronounce this approximant , but it 's much harder with [ w ] . 
  while i agree with you that ` vat ' is inaccurate way of transcribing with typical finish pronunciation in regard , i think that for english speakers ` vat ' just means mispronounced what ( be it with v or \u028b ) . 
  well , to me it sounds as [ \u028b ] as i am `` born '' with that sound . 
  :d or it sounds like a weakly ( mis ) pronounced [ v ] . 
  i meant , if you have to explain someone how to pronounce [ \u028b ] , would n't you say it 's similar to [ v ] , but only tongue is little bit lower , and there is less force in pronouncing it , or would you say , pronounce it like [ w ] , but with no velarization , lips should n't be rounded ... 
  these are pronounced by same person , i would say that [ w ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:voiced_labio-velar_approximant.ogg ) is way off . 
  [ \u028b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:labiodental_approximant.ogg ) is much closer to [ v ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:voiced_labiodental_fricative.ogg ) . 
  but this difference in perception ( of you and me ) could be explain with different language . 
  in croatian dialects [ v ] exists and replaces [ \u028b ] ( so in a way i 'm used to hearing it ) , while i do n't think i ever heard [ w ] used ( it 's completely foreign sound to me ) . 
  i hear it as [ \u028bati ] . 
  i 'm not sure about the ` a ' though . 
  it probably is n't central . 
  truth be told , there is no best way to transcribe [ \u028b ] in english with english . 
  that 's why i always hate those * english random syllables * transcriptions of foreign words/sounds . 
  theoretically w would be suitable replacement , but only when [ \u028b ] is followed by an already labialized vowel , like u , or o. 
  otherwise , to my ear [ \u028b ] is much more `` closer '' to [ v ] than [ w ] - but that could be 'cause ( standard ) croatian does n't have [ v ] or [ w ] , only [ \u028b ] . 
  edit : we also need to take into consideration the fact that if an english speaking person hears ` what ' mispronounced - be it as [ \u028bat ] or [ vat ] - one will always write it as vat , not as what ( or wat ) , as the latter would imply the correct pronunciation of w , which [ v ] or [ \u028b ] are n't . 
  it 's not , but i do n't think you can expect someone to use this symbol [ \u028b ] for labiodental approximant . 
  and i doubt average person is able to consistently recognize difference in pronunciation between [ \u028b ] and [ v ] . 
  plus , languages rarely have both sounds as phonemes , i know only of dutch , so using v instead of \u028b is rather convenient for `` loose '' phonetic transcription . 
  that is something you should ask them , not me . 
  guys , sorry about that . 
  but they do n't live here !, 
  it does n't matter even if you have someone left behind . 
  and as a result we get guys like [ \u017deljko glasnovi\u0107 ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017deljko_glasnovi\u0107 ) , who was elected by diaspora , in the parliament , and his contribution was to insult students who wanted transparency from the university . 
  diaspora voting is also the reason why we have all this drama about erdo\u011fan . 
  edit : if i were to migrate , i would be the first to deny myself the right to vote for a country i do n't live anymore in . 
  they ca n't be the same colour as we are . 
  it is the same . 
  it 's just that when i read * latin * , i though of the alphabet not the language , which was confusing at first . 
  we have that verb as well . 
  ( u ) pamtiti = to remember . 
   slavic cognates often come to mean completely different things ; another fun example is that the croatian word `` ponos '' means diarrhea in russian . 
  lol . 
  polish would be pami\u0119\u0107 . 
  the meaning is changed , but the root mi\u0119\u0107 is from praslav . 
  m\u0119t\u044c which comes from the same word as english mind . 
  yea , i checked that . 
  [ apparently it is derived from mut . 
   which has obvious cognates with english ( for-stand ) or even more obvious one  under-stand . 
  it says that german equivalent , or at least in high german , is/would be * gimunt * . 
  as far as my knowledge of ( standard ) german goes , this word does not exists . 
  it is however possible that in some german dialect the aforementioned is indeed preserved . 
  and i can write the same sentence in croatian using the * same * words . 
  i 've adjusted it a little bit to use cognates , so it sound a bit odd . 
  u ** moj ** oj pa ** met ** i po ** znav ** ao sam ** sto ** tinu ** nov ** ih ** no\u0107 ** i. 
  a little bit of explanation : pamet is from praslav . 
  \\* pa-m\u0119t\u044c ; \u0119 is a nasal sound from a front vowel and a nasal consonant . 
  pa - means * fake * , * quasi * , so the word originally meant something like stupid , crazy , or the opposite of reason ( mind ) . 
  z is originally from g ; \\* gnati < ie . 
  co - ** gno ** scere ) . 
  no\u0107 is from praslavic * notj\u044c < ie . 
  letters that are not bolded are either preffixes , derivation or declension suffixes . 
  west actually . 
  i read that today in alemko gluhak 's etymological dictionary . 
  and belorussians are west of russians , so it does make sense .
