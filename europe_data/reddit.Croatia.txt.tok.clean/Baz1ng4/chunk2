  i believe that in ` prosinac ' it is actually the meaning under d for [ pro- ] ( http://hjp.znanje.hr/index.php?show=search_by_id&amp;id=dl9nxhc%3d&amp;keyword=pro ) :  proces kroz koji \u0161to prolazi u punom opsegu radnje , zavr\u0161nost radnje and in that sense ` prosinac ' would refer to ** becoming ** grayish/ashen-like/light bluish/white . 
  at least that is what i think as it snows ( or at least it used to ) and everything becomes white/blue . 
  yes , but it is how korean/chinese/japanese would be if written in latin script , so it is n't really based on a particular language . 
  in some part it does rely on english , for instance , ch is pronounced like you would in english [ t\u0283 ] and not like in french or german , but then again x in chinese is something closer to [ \u0292 ] . 
  yes , it would be much clearer as to how to pronounce if everything was done with ipa notation , but unfortunately only few would actually understand it , i believe . 
  that 's the origin of the greating : bolan ne bio !, 
  yes , but i could n't find that verb in skok 's etymological dictionary and he has an impressive and quite extensive list of croatian words , be it dialectal or archaic . 
  [ brezen ] ( https://hr.wiktionary.org/wiki/brezen ) existed in croatian as well . 
  it 's just that o\u017eujak was much more common and therefore chosen as standard name . 
  russia is not in eu . 
  this is about countries that are already part of ** european union ** . 
  not about every country in ** europe ** . 
  it 's the first time i heard of this etymology . 
  i think this is incorrect because in some dialects there were other form attested , such as [ ` la\u017eak ' , ` l\u017eujak ' , or ` la\u017eujak ' ] ( https://hr.wiktionary.org/wiki/o\u017eujak ) , and each of this forms points to the word for lie . 
  explanation of croatian name for march : the word * o\u017eujak * [ ipa pronunciation : o\u031e\u0292uja\u0308k ] is derived from older form l\u044a\u017euj\u044ck\u044a . 
  the root of this word is word l\u044a\u017e\u044c , which in contemporary croatian is * la\u017e * , and it means * a lie * . 
  it 's because the third month can be quite tricky . 
  it can snow , it can appear warm and sunny , and then suddenly it turns to rain , so people named it * a treacherous month * . 
  i do n't believe he was ethnic croat . 
  his ethnicity is serbian as the majority of evidence points to that , even though you can never be 100 % sure with that , and he had american citizenship . 
  he was born in croatia though , which was part of austrian empire at that time . 
  and i also believe that he can be celebrated by croatians as well - even though he was a serb - for what he did , not for what stood on his birth certificate . 
  we should be more inclusive , not exclusive . 
  he di n't choose the place of his birth , and he did not choose to whom he would be born . 
  if that little tool ( :p ) you posted is used for woodwork ( i 've no idea honestly ) , then it is the same . 
  and it 's not surprising since romanian word is borrowed from some slavic language . 
  [ and that tool on the left is tesla in croatian . 
  yea , of course . 
  same as ketchup . 
  yes , but in latin and/or greek . 
  you go hungary . 
  people rarely appreciate translation of words and adjusting it to one 's language over simple borrowing ... 
  your remarks stands . 
  i was n't trying to prove you wrong . 
  mention of dislike was to explain the change in the meaning and it has nothing to do with todays relationship between people or nation and dislike with each other . 
  the word is not from yesterday ... 
  if [ skok ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_skok ) is right , then both words ( tuka/tukan and \u0107urka / \u0107uran ) are of the same origin . 
  in his etymological dictionary he derives it from tur\u010din ( turk ) - it also corresponds with the english name for the animal - and it also explains the reason why tuka can be used as a derogatory word ( meaning stupid person , mostly used for females ) - while puran/pura or purica can not - because slavs did n't show love for turks ( ottomans ) in the past . 
  it was supposed to be y , i think at least . 
  maybe it was a mix up 'cause american keyboard has y after t . but then w is also missing . 
  yea , you 're right , i did n't even check the year of his birth , i just assumed it was during a-u . 
  ups . 
  well , austro-hungarian then . 
  there was no austria at that time , unless you want to irritate hungarians . 
  not exactly . 
  in english you use pronoun ` they ' for gender neutrality . 
  in croatian pronoun ` on ' is referring to a noun * du\u0161manin * , not to a male person . 
  croatian nouns have grammatical gender , a feature modern english does not utilize anymore - that 's why ` he ' only refers to men . 
  as can be seen in the previous sentence , theword * enemy * is in singular , therefore this grammatical discrepancy - between enemy ( sg . ), 
  and they ( pl . ), 
  - has to be build semantically and with context , which is here given . 
  yea , i remember the same thing when i learned the russian . 
  they do n't use verb ` to have ' ( imati/imeti ) , but rather a phrase ' y menya est + g ' . 
  the same expression is understand in the same way in croatian ( is it same for slovenian ? 
  ) , but it does sound a bit `` poetic '' . 
  well , not much different from this . 
  continental part would be central europe , and the coastal is southern . 
  many croatian themselves will point the * cultural * differences between continental and coastal croatians . 
  they do have horse archers . 
  makes sense actually . 
  both are/were amazing riders and title ` khan ' sounds similar to ` khal ' . 
  croatia centre and south-centre . 
  case closed !, 
  no need for new maps, 
  this is almost exactly how i view the europe . 
  some countries simply ca n't be just ` eastern ' , ` southern ' , ` western ' ... 
  proto-slavic and latin are cognate , and also english word wit came from the same word making word witness ( which is also the meaning of greek histor - `` the one who saw knows , so can testify '' ) . 
  similarly we have svjedok ( s-v\u011bd-ok ) `` the one with knowledge '' . 
  yea , probably true as it is same in croatian . 
  in croatian word for chemistry is ` lu\u010dba ' which is from verb ` lu\u010diti ' which basically means to separate or to discern . 
  well , it 's not a coincidence . 
  ` saga ' comes from a verb which means ` to talk ' , ` to say ' ( german ` sagen ' and english ` say ' are of the same origin ) . 
  same way our word for history ` povijest ' is derived from ( \u010dakavian ) ` povidati ' which means to talk . 
  what 's even better is that germanic words for talking/saying is related to the words for seeing . 
  same as in croatian [ povijest < v ** \u011b ** d ( znanje ) ~ v ** i ** d ( sight ) ] , and in greek : histor `` the one who knows and/or sees '' . 
  wtf is kozovperstk ?

  there is always an option of returning that piece of land they do n't know what to do with so that the bridge does n't have to be build , and the problem is solved . 
  what was the joke ? 
  it can . 
  and it was . 
  it was written with special type of cyrillic called bosan\u010dica / arvatica/western cyrillic/croatian script ... 
  croatians call it ' \u010dudnovati kljuna\u0161 ' ( not kljunar ) which translates to english something as peculiar beak mammal . 
  what if he puts the car in the swimming pool and fills the car with water and then opens the door , and then he repeats it until pool is full and car is washed ? 
  that 's madness . 
  and there 's also glavomet ( glava = \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432a ) . 
  but rukomet is fine , right ? 
   lest it catch ~ ~ es ~ ~ you lest is a special conjunction , it requires subjunctive .
