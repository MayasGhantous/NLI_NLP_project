it refers to sex , though , not to war . 
  the op is now deeply disappointed as he probably imagined we all heard that song , went completely nuts and that is how the war started . 
  really prophetic song was this [ song by ekv ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusthfwzjps ) : par godina za nas / [ only a few years left for us ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/samo_par_godina_za_nas ) . 
  did they mean yugoslavia will die in a few years , or were they talking about themselves ? 
  most of the band members died within a decade . 
  the [ one remaining guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sr\u0111an_todorovi\u0107 ) from that clip lived to star in the `` serbian movie '' . 
  i had several clashes with this guy in the past and i noticed his name in several other conflicts with southern europeans . 
  he is from denmark , one of the most tolerant and polite countries on the planet and he 's probably one of the least tolerant people on reddit . 
  quick profiling creates a picture where he 's blond , has goatee , works in a sausage factory and he 's aries in horoscope . 
   every parade that was organized ended up bloody and should be avoided until and if people change eventually . 
  at least we got a surprisingly good movie about belgrade parades : [ parade ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1784575/ ), 
  as you , in croatia we have this `` starting point '' , the brutto that 's almost pontless because i get the netto and the employer pays the second brutto . 
  my `` official '' pay goes like this - kuna and euro : ( i ) bruto 1 ... ... ... ... . . 8.100,00 ( 1065,79 $ ) ( a ) health insurance 15,5 % ... . 1.255,50 ( 165,20 $ ) ( b ) unemployment insurance 1,7 % ... . 137,70 ( 18,12 $ ) ( ii ) bruto 2 . . ( i + a + b ) ... . 9.493,20 ( 1249,11 $ ) ( c ) retirement 15 % + 5 % ... ... 1.620,00 ( 213,16 $ ) ( d ) taxes ... ... ... ... ... 925,20 ( 121,73 $ ) neto payment ... ( i - c - d ) ... . 5.696,00 ( 749,47 $ ) tl ; dr - my company wastes 1249,11 $ so i can get 749,47 $ . 
  if anyone asks , i just say `` five and a half '' , but then again , a lot of people in croatia get another part on top of their pay , what can be considered as the `` gray area '' economy . 
  let 's say in my situatation it would amount to extra 400 $ or so . 
   damn yugoslavia - why did you split ? 
  you asked the question and he answered to you . 
   says the romanian ? 
  that was you so he answered to that question . 
   takes one to know one see ? 
  but the real truth is revelaed in this chart : [ italy is far from romania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fwc3sjb.png ), 
  there is collective amnesia about the reasons why complete serbian population left occupied territory in a single day and went to serbia . 
  it was n't result of fighting but a decision made by serbian leaders . 
  to this day i ca n't understand their logic and why they did it . 
  at some point later they all realized it was a bad move so now they pretend as if all those unfortunate people left because somehow our soldiers managed to go door to door and force them to leave * in a single day !, 
  * internet was not as widespread in august of 1995 , i just had it since december of 1994 so i ca n't find a single archive of croatian or serbian newspapers from that time on the internet but i am sure public libraries in belgrade have all the records we need . 
  can someone in serbia please go to a public library and find newspapers from august 13th and 27th , 1995 . 
  the leader of croatian serbs had press conferences in belgrade where he explained ** why ** he and his aides decided to evacuate the people and how he came to that decision . 
  he allegedly showed documents with the decision signed by him and other people , dated august 4th or 5th , 1995 . 
  i have these events referenced in a book , but i do n't have access to the actual source for these claims - serbian newspapers from the time and just looking at papers * ve\u0107ernje novosti * and * politika * from these dates should clear these matters a bit . 
  please , can someone look up in * ve\u0107ernje novosti * and * politika * and report if there was a press conference on aug 27 , 1995 held by milan marti\u0107 . 
  you should look for this :  `` odluka o evakuaciji stanovni\u0161tva iz op\u0161tina knin , benkovac , obrovac , drni\u0161 i gra\u010dac '' , signed by milan marti\u0107 interesting link i found ( in serbian ) : [ povodom 19 godina od `` oluje '' ] ( http://blog.b92.net/text/24512/povodom-19-godina-od-oluje/ ) and in the end i just want to state that personaly i was always sorry that these people had to leave , as i felt for all refugies on this planet . 
  leaving your home and everything is like dying in part . 
  til - [ diana budisavljevi\u0107 ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diana_budisavljevi\u0107 ) worked together with the zagreb archdiocese branch of the caritas and in that way made it possible for several thousands of children to be placed with families in zagreb and rural communities . 
  out of 15,536 children that diana budisavljevi\u0107 saved , 3,254 children died during the rescue or immediately after leaving the camp , exhausted by torture , hunger and disease , while more than 12,000 rescued children survived the war . 
  they are related but not directly . 
  anyway , she is now making a documentary about diana . 
  working title is diana 's list . 
  not very original , but it describes the biggest rescue of children from concentration camps during ww2 so the name probably came almost naturally . 
  translation : [ `` diana 's list '' is the story of the best people in the worst of times ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww.novilist.hr%2fscena%2ffilm%2fdianina-lista-je-prica-o-najboljim-ljudima-u-najgorim-vremenima&amp;edit-text= ), 
  my god !, 
  more than 25 years have passed since we had this circus called antibureaucratic revolution and later even [ yogurt revolution ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfnxy9b6kpu ) . 
  this is how the balkan shit started . 
  unfortunately the audio is in serbian so many people would not understand . 
  back then , milo\u0161evi\u0107 started small : ** serbia is in a bad position and serbs are threatened by vojvodina and kosovo . 
  ** once he had those places secured , slovenia and croatia became major target . 
  and then the war started . 
  twenty years ago internet was not as widespread as it is today . 
  otherwise , serbian soldiers would post similar images - even though serbia was never officially involved in wars in croatia and bosnia . 
  there were big organized units from serbia as we could see on serbian tv about drafts and recruiting in belgrade , novi sad and other serbian cities . 
  and then , there were weekend warriors or [ tourist warriors ] ( http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/tourist-warriors.29.html?news_id=11951 ) from te testimony of general mile novakovic . 
  edit - the general 's testimony was just typical - `` we just happened to be there , no one sent us , and yugoslav army was sending me paychecks for four years even though they had no idea where i was . '', 
  the witness : the salary was deposited to my account . 
  judge moloto : by whom ? 
  that 's -- my question is : by whom ? 
  who was the authority who was paying you ? 
  who was your boss ? 
  who was your employer ? 
  the witness : my employer was still , as far as salary is concerned , the army of yugoslavia . 
  judge moloto : okay . 
  and after -- after august 1992 you continued to be paid by the army of yugoslavia ; no longer the jna this time , but now the vj ? 
  the witness : that is correct , your honour . 
  judge moloto : thanks . 
  mr. lukic : q. 
  other than issuing your salary , was the army of yugoslavia in any other way your employer ? 
  the witness : a. 
  no , not in any other way . 
  are you sure ? 
  [ they were almost everywhere , but not here ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/viking_expansion ), 
  vikings never reached balkans so we ca n't really hate nordic nations . 
  [ tito sent johnny cash to kill him  ] ( http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/29e9ax/til_that_johnny_cash_while_working_as_an_air/ ), 
  serbs like to display gavrilo princip as a hero and a great patriot : he just had to kill the archduke to liberate his people , but history is a bitch . 
  exactly 20 years later , serbian king alexander was killed in marseilles by macedonian and croatian nationalists and sure , serbs now could recognize terrorists and not freedom fighters in that case . 
  unfortunately , one of the organizers of that assassination was protected by mussolini and later brought to occupied croatia and placed as a president of the puppet fascist regime . 
  clear example of what happens when you put terrorists tu run countries and a warning people should never glorify acts of terror . 
   the historical `` backstabbers '' ... ah , seen this twice today : [ le petit journal ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xbrgzcy.jpg ), 
  pretty much , first thing i noticed big ben is missing - does that mean interrail does not cover uk ? 
  on our national tv it was pointed out that around 70 of contestants were injured and asked for medical assistance in the local hospital . 
  if i remember correctly , 6 ukrainians and 5 russians are among them as their battle was rather fearsome . 
  edit - the video : [ botn 2014 : 21-21 russia vs. ukraine ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgk2crt-jnq ), 
  ok , like i said we need real information about it . 
  [ for example , mpri ] ( http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-isenberg/mpri-couldnt-read-minds-l_b_688000.html ) . 
  they went to croatia in january of ' 95 , started a course for 40 people in april and operation storm was in august . 
  if they are so good how come they ca n't repeat the same thing in iraq , ukraine or anywhere else ? 
   ... in april of '95 ... we had one class of about 40 who had graduated in july from the , from the overall course . 
  and the concept that one could go there , or go anywhere , no matter how brilliant your instruction may be , and turn an army around in a month , no , no serious military analyst would ever dream that anyone could do that . 
   expulsion of krajina serbs from croatia definitely one of the biggest skeletons in both our countries ' closets . 
  never really explained who ordered those people to go and why . 
  i saw something else - brasil has border with almost all other countries on the continent . 
  q : what two countries in south america do not border brazil ? 
   when you had to wait in long lines to maybe get bread . 
  when was that ? 
  maybe in 1946 , just after the war with all the infrastructure destroyed ? 
  as a kid in the eighties i remember waiting in line with my mom to buy lego bricks and then a bit later for a pineapple . 
  between 1981 and 1985 there was shortage with imported stuff like oil/gas , detergents , chocolate and coffee and similar goods . 
  most people just went to austria or italy to buy whatever they needed . 
  it was n't all bread and butter , honey and milk but the way i see it for the average guy life in the seventies or eighties was better . 
  on the other hand , yugoslavia was politically unstable . 
  as slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 took power in serbia everything turned upside down and cohesive powers just collapsed . 
  there was n't much keeping nations together any more .
