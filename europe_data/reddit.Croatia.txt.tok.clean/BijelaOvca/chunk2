  looking long term , separate ways may be the better option but first each country needs to find its way into prosperity . 
  belgrade ? 
  i mean , it 's obvious : east of belgium . 
  belgrade , the capitol of belarus . 
  how can you say that ? 
  [ italinan help was invaluable ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_invasion_of_france ) :  on 20 june , the italian campaign began and , by the 21 june , troops of the italian royal army had crossed the french border . 
  the italian forces attacking through the french riviera advanced only about 5 mi ( 8.0 km ) and were stopped in the vicinity of the town of menton . 
  so , putin is literally hitler : 1 .

  man i completely understand your point of view , but it really is a bit naive , like saying that jews could have done something different to appease nazis . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 came to power and put his plans in motion before other republics started working on independence . 
  no matter what others did he wanted his prey : to stay in power as communism collapsed so he used serbian nationalism for that . 
  this is why he went to war with almost everyone else in ex-yu . 
  other than that , sure croatia could have done many things differently . 
  unfortunately no one comes innocent out of the war . 
  for example , we are now run mostly by war profiteers , all sorts of criminals and bastards . 
  your point being what ? 
  they are all the same ? 
  like dresden ? 
  incendiary bombs on hamburg ? 
  incendiary bombs on tokio ? 
  hundereds of thousends of dead in a single night . 
  mass rapes in berlin by the soviets . 
  are they all the same ? 
  next time you see someone talking about nazies make sure you also point out all the other things that went on in the war . 
  are churchill , roosevelt and stalin war criminals and does that justify all the things hitler did ? 
  tl ; dr - serbs knew in 1990 what will croatia do in 1995 . 
   ukraine 's `` fascism . '' when serbs attacked croatia 25 years ago they used the same rhetoric . 
  oh , do n't say that . 
  on many occasions during our war , because of the stuff i saw on tv or for personal reasons , i was fantasizing about someone bombing you . 
  on the day when nato started bombing serbia i was cheerful for a minute but then i realized a lot of innocent people would lose their lives or suffer other damages . 
  i remember becoming very sad after a while . 
  tl ; dr - bombing someone inflicts bad time on innocent people , idiots would remain idiots even after bombing . 
  edit - a bit . 
   ... whenever i hear a word like ` raus ' or ` schnell ' i ca n't help but think of nazis . 
  great !, 
  once they get help from syrian rebels everything will be fine . 
   stop like this : [ sotp ] ( https://www.google.com/search?q=sotp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=x ) ? 
  [ this is filmed ] ( http://youtu.be/sphtb-67cuo?t=6m ) in the part of croatia only a few miles from slovenia , most of the trees look pretty damaged . 
  six minutes into the video you can see the driver going out and clearing up the fallen branches from the road . 
  after 50 000 km you ca n't call it a virgin , that 's for sure . 
  i knew our brothers from serbia must be somewhere near . 
  the real winter is coming our way so we should prepare for the blazing shitstorm . 
  border of east germany is not visible . 
  please fix the map . 
  translation : all of the serbia is on reddit . 
  they 're communists . 
   cat i started with the same word . 
  next thing - `` girl '' and it gave me back the word `` girl '' for slovenia . 
  i think they say `` dekla '' or `` dekle '' or something . 
  so sorry for my ignorance . 
  i must admit that i have n't seen a mosque in serbia , but then again i was there only a few times . 
  recently i saw a text about how most traces of ottomans have been destroyed in serbia , but now it seems that was written by some idiot or worse . 
  anyway , deepest apologies . 
  i wo n't delete that post above - should remind me in the future to check things before i write something . 
  so you get a lot of downvotes . 
  but , where are the mosques in serbia ? 
  five hundred years of ottoman rule and no mosques . 
  in bosnia and macedonia there are lots of them , but in serbia they do n't exist . 
  is n't it strange ? 
  only place that look `` normal & safe '' to me were around la defense . 
  everything else was very frustrating even during the day . 
   are you fucking high dude ? 
  paris is worse than the croatian war ? 
  in absolute terms no , but if you expect one thing and experience something entirely different , then yes . 
  on top of that , paris is still there , our war is over . 
  ... and waiters never giving you back the exact amount ... 
   i honestly get more culture shock going to see my parents in america i suppose they 're not in new york because i really felt almost at home over there . 
  ca n't say things were the same , but combination of similarites and differences in ny felt rather good . 
  if i ever move from croatia i hope it 'll be new york . 
  well , i can dream ... 
  which brings me to the question why do n't we have you more often in / r/croatia ? 
  it would be nice to see your comments and perspective . 
  especially now when things suddenly feel a bit different that just a few months before as we have those christian fundamentalists , all kinds of right wingers and even fascists crawling out from under the rocks . 
  heard lately that vienna is n't what it was before . 
  now you say salzburg . 
  that 's really depressing . 
  i 'm from croatia and i 've been to most ex-yu places , then in italy , austria , germany , greece and france . 
  paris was total shock to me . 
  at one side those monumental , beautifull buildings , palaces and parks , on the other side , distractions , beggars - excusez moi pour vous deranger - all day long . 
  on the street , in the sub , everywhere . 
  money , cigarettes , anything . 
  the paris was living hell to me . 
  and i was participating in our war , you know - uniform , ak-47 , three days at home , three days at the front line , then no home for a month during the summer of 1995 , ... 
  but nothing could prepare me for paris .

  excellent . 
  so you 'd better all just stay where you are , no need to come over here ever again . 
  really looks like unsolvable problem . 
  i remember reading this article and thinking there 's something wrong with the author , but as the time goes by , i can see his point : http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/924795/posts, 
   this is why we ca n't have nice things like yugoslavia . 
  ...  i was in yugoslavia . 
  it was in 1950 , in zagreb , in a brigade of workers . 
  so , i feel grat sympathy for president tito and the yugoslav peoples . 
   you are now in kampuchea as friends .
