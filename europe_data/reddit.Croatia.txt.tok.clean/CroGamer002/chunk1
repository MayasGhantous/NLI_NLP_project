we 'd mock and judge that peasant . 
  well demagogue dictator that supports terrorism should be able to recognize his own kind . 
  op , you do realize this is number 1 subreddit in hating roma people ? 
  i 've read `` poppies '' as `` puppies '' . 
  that nearly made me spit my drink . 
  likely some obscure extremist group you have . 
  do n't be silly , illuminati is a false flag created by barrack osama . 
  you 'll join us as well !, 
   just physically ** impossible ** . 
  ftfy, 
  yeah , no . 
  malaysia is not doing that . 
  this is / r/conspiracy level article . 
  til ukraine more progressive then sweden . 
  well , he was not allowed to vote as he refused to remove his mask . 
  well he did said educated people . 
  even romans were barbarians to them . 
  then greeks become romans . 
  i like how they think eu is a state . 
  yeah , about that cold war ... 
  [ ah ] ( http://www.hercegovina.info/img/repository/2010/05/medium/bbb-bojkotiraju-13-svibnja-a-upitan-i-boban.jpg ) [ the ] ( http://zurnal.ba/upload/images/arhiva/slike/dogadjaji/din2.jpg ) [ memories ] ( http://depo.ba/media/pictures/2010/05/12/4f6589618a975613ba7fb767da134968.jpg ) . 
   people are really disappointed with sdp and specially with milanovi\u0107 and his ministers . 
  that would be an understatement . 
  also none of the ministers milanovi\u0107 have started with are even in parliament anymore and new ministers are even worse while heavily apologetic and defensive . 
  you 're my neighbors . 
  i hate neighbors . 
  twas a joke , just like the map . 
  i did this several months ago on / r/croatia . 
  [ it has n't changed since ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0tmgy7o.png ) . 
   ** un ** surprisingly because his voters were mostly uneducated folks ftfy, 
  only if you help us get super fast and cheap internet . 
  may ukraine have the same soon . 
  finally that goddamn corrupt populist is going down . 
  no contest . 
  traitor that give away shit-ton of territory to italy , voluntarily started holocaust , turned country economy solely to support german war machine , he was a totalitarian cunt and the worst of all he was a mussolini 's bitch . 
  pretty sure it 's more about macedonians stealing greek history and identity . 
  wrong one !, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_serbian_krajina http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republika_srpska this ones . 
   for instance , european parliament says release estonian citizen not eu citizen . 
  it 's still not `` one of us '' but rather every nation is seen as separate . 
  eu is not a country , so the fuck are you talking about ? 
  as well us and canada can invade through arctic . 
  and due to that belarus would not allow russia to use it as a highway to invade poland directly . 
  if they are used , nato will bomb the living fuck out of belarus and be used as a battlefront in nato 's counteroffensive . 
  what a mess . 
  and where 's russia ? 
  what map ? 
  pretty much . 
  yeah , effect put in makes it fake as fuck . 
  first off , imperial germany during ww1 sent every damn possible radical and revolutionary to imperial russia to cause disorder . 
  communists were just one of those . 
  every other country that become communist ( but cuba , yugoslavia and china ) become communist due to ussr `` liberating '' them from nazi occupation/nazi puppet regime . 
  those communist countries were far more far-right fascist then resembling anything left-wing . 
  and in eastern europe , communist mostly means pro-russian imperialist . 
   minor pro-russian meetings here . 
  ... anymore that 's one way to say about that . 
  it will be much better to start a new thread , as this thread reached it 's prime . 
  my guess is it 's because many other sites link to their articles , so if they change url those links will become broken so they lose extra hits . 
  likely . 
  i 've seen russia today not changing url , after changing their title from pure propaganda to actual truth ( as well as rest of the text ) . 
  ... what ? 
  i have n't moved to germany !, 
  ... yet ... 
  sometimes jokes just do n't work for being fully out of place or being inappropriate . 
  hard lesson i learned the hard way . 
  as in , by loss of reddit karma . 
  so kebab blood it is . 
  oh wait , i did n't notice the typo . 
  ... you did n't heard anyone yelling , capiche ? 
  ** nikola tesla pure croat !, 
  stinking serb steal our history . 
  worse then macedonians , you stinking serbs . 
  may you be thousands years more under kebab rule . 
  that 's hardly a new weapon . 
  then how do you post here ? 
  magic ? 
  kebab blood ? 
  because it 's unrelated . 
  nah , it 's obvious they pulled a prank on new employee !, 
  oh wow , that mistake is miles away from simple brainfart . 
  shhhhhhhhhh !, 
  nobody has to know that , my silly neighbor . 
  well , even the bbc employees can make silly mistakes on occasion . 
  i think it 's more of an editor of website derped and put article in wrong category by accident . 
  yep , but url still says africa . 
  which they ca n't fix that without fully removing the article and reposting it on proper category . 
  you are using domain from uk , though . 
  www.bbc.co.uk i 'm just using this one . 
  for bbc , balkans are only ex-yugoslav republics . 
  we 're not being exploited by foreign corporations , so i guess not . 
  [ proof ] ( http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27460450 ) . 
  in case you do not know , bbc categorizes news by continent where the news happen ( usa & canada , uk and middle east have their own sections ) . 
  this surprised and made me laugh a bit . 
  to see set of images from serbia and bosnia under the news category from africa , instead of europe , is a bizarre mistake to see from bbc . 
   reports : `` vladamir putin so upset by eurovision boo 's he is pulling out of ukraine '' that would be the most hilarious thing to read in history books . 
  more due to lack of interest and heavy negative criticism on eurovision , then austerity . 
  basically , people here do n't give to shits for eurovision anymore so it 's a waste of money for tv stations to take part of it . 
  except france needed months to properly mobilize and it 's entire military doctrine was defensive after versailles treaty . 
  and even if they had offensive ability , it required to go through neutral belgium as germany had serious fortifications along french border , even if not on same scale as french had on own side . 
  and amphibious invasion directly into germany was out of the question .
