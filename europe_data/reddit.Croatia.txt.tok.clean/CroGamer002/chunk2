  neither the uk nor france had capability , resources , technology nor logistics to do normandy style invasion on germany . 
  only realistic time france could have invaded germany directly , was if they and uk resisted and not allowed czechoslovakia to be annexed . 
  they 'd still need time to mobilize , but germany would be nearly as powerful as it was with poland and it would have required to go through czechoslovakian massive fortifications on mountainous region . 
  loss of czechoslovakia was the point ww2 was inevitable and belgium going neutral made french 's realistic chances at resistance almost impossible in it 's major political disarray and population 's unwillingness to repeat ww1 . 
  not really , france was still utterly demoralized since ww1 's massive casualties and destruction . 
  as well it was fully divided , as they had their own communist and fascist factions and in verge to fall into civil war too . 
  france was fucked and unwilling to repeat ww1 , hence quick surrender . 
  well that and belgium going neutral , completely destroying french defensive plans on properly dealing with germany . 
  well when you get invaded by 2 different super powers on 2 different fronts in span of few weeks and without any other external support , i think people should cut poland some slack . 
  then again , france got the worst of it by getting reputation of white flag waving surrendering monkeys , just for their quick defeat in ww2 despite having the most successful military history . 
  so why am i surprised ? 
   whatever happens , it will be over in a month , after new elections russia ca n't villify kiev as some sort of a nazi den and goverment gains legitimacy . 
  lol , that 's not gon na stop russian propaganda machine, 
  what the hell did the west do wrong , besides being inept to stand up against russian properly ? 
  is it just me , or numbers even lower on russian support from last large survey made from there ? 
   ya we have the historical reputation that where weak poland was pretty darn powerful through most of it 's history . 
  i would n't say germany is scarred , but too obsessed with economy . 
  nobody would like to be in dark alleyway with svoboda party member , but another svoboda party member . 
  holy shit , i thought they only steal greek history . 
  while putting golden statues of historic people they 're stealing from greece is hell of a lot more important then taking care of your students , for macedon government . 
  hmh , no ? 
  sadly , incompetence is not a crime . 
  as much as we wanted it to be . 
  sdp is too damn incompetent to create mafia like hdz did , as much as they try to be . 
  nah , croatian government is n't paying any attention to situation in crimea . 
  would have be nice , if it was . 
  my guess is mods become inactive for more then 2 months , which allows moderation to be removed and given to someone else . 
   germany does n't have a constitutional ban . 
  oh , then i was misinformed on that part . 
  i apologize . 
  so i can still laugh at serbia to feel better and superior . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ still ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ weeps ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ corner ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ today 's ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ban . 
  half of eu members have this sort of constitutional ban . 
  not just eastern bloc , but also germany , italy and hungary . 
  though they do have registered civil unions and croatian socialist-liberal parliament coalition majority promised to implement it in following days . 
  giant embarrassment !, 
  and that 's to say at least . 
  you tried and failed last 3 times . 
  no more !, 
  sadly , croats ai n't no cheap labor . 
  oh and , good luck with getting through our bureaucracy . 
  then go smarter voter and become that smart leader for smart voters to vote . 
  funny , i can see original image but not mirrored one . 
  you 're sick . 
  yes , send them to their possible tortures or deaths . 
  more like if you treat people like animals , they wo n't be respectful to you on any level . 
  macedonian and hungarian authorities acted very aggressively and inhumane against refugees from day one , no wonder refugees reacted the way they did later on . 
   if germany had won all that , i dont believe they would have keep any of it ftfy, 
  probably not . 
  i do n't think berlusconi will be welcomed in ukraine ever again . 
   for millennia this continent has been populated by ** our race ** i 'm sorry , but how do you not see that as full stormfront statement ? 
   if donald trump becomes president if he becomes a us president , then nobody on earth is safe . 
  flame war !, 
  i guess they 're traitors to him ? 
  because they knew that croats and slovenes would rebel if they had done that and serbia was in no position to quell the rebellion as they suffered massive losses in ww1 ( 17 % to 28 % of their population was killed through military operations and famine , mostly men ) and serbia itself needed to get rebuild . 
  instead , they went with long term political domination in kingdom of yugoslavia by making serbs overwhelmingly on high military positions , serbinization of education system , centralizing all power in belgrade and etc. 
  around late 19th and early 20th century , croatian and slovenian elite wanted to form a yugoslav confederation similar to switzerland 's model . 
  serbian elite , on another hand , wanted a greater serbia . 
  because serb minority thought independent croatia will be ruled by facist nazis that will kill or deport them all , because propaganda . 
  i 'm simplifying it , but in general that had happen . 
  holy shit , someone finally agrees with me on that . 
  what did he do ? 
  while you 're at it , only reason anti-gay marriage referendum in croatia succeed is because we have no minimal requirement for voter turnout . 
  we used to have 50 % +1 voter turnout requirement for referendums , but was removed right before referendum on joining eu . 
  because , shockingly , eu referendum had a low voter turnout . 
  a forced union that collapsed once an only person capable to keep forced union alive had died . 
  you missed my joke by a mile . 
  the most important question is , does new zealand exist here ? 
  and you can only blame usa for that !, 
  you assume that 's us exclusive . 
  at this point , even isis is a better alternative then assad . 
  at very least , isis pushes for meritocracy over nepotism and majority of civilian population is not oppressed or does n't feel oppressed as many in isis occupied territories ( as well in big chunk of fsa controlled territory ) approve of sharia laws . 
  so bizarrely enough , isis would be better then assad 's regime for syria . 
  and that 's just messed up , when you consider how fucked up isis is and their failed state would never damn work in modern world . 
  i think the revolution and then a military coup had already devastated egyptian tourism . 
  except for the fact the main motivation for majority of wars in history had happen over economical gains for state , political elite and for an average citizen . 
  croatia has been selling a lot of arms to iraq and iraqi kurdistan , especially after mosul fallen to isis . 
  with that , isis considers croatia to be directly involved in fight against them . 
  hence why they capture our citizen and tragically executed him as a message . 
  if it is n't hard to do , then it would have been done ages ago . 
  assad caused the whole war with his refusal to enact any economical and anti-corruption reforms while violently suppressing protesters and he was harboring a lot of al qaeda and jama'at al-tawhid wal-jihad ( original insurgent group that formed isis ) members so they can have a safe base to attack us troops in iraq . 
  so hell no , assad is the problem that syria has to fix to end the war and stabilize . 
   i 'd say its more likely that eu would disintegrate , unfortunately . 
  well eu is not a single state and countries can leave without facing military response nor economical isolation from world . 
  hey !, 
  we 're not twins !, 
   bigot : `` a person who is intolerant towards those holding different opinions . '', 
  [ because i wanted to avoid the word racism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bigotry ) . 
  * the concept of bigotry can have slightly different meanings in american and british english . 
  * * in british english it refers to a state of mind where a person is obstinately , irrationally , or unfairly intolerant of ideas , opinions , or beliefs that differ from their own , and intolerant of the people who hold them . 
  * * in american english , the term can be used similarly ; * *** however , it can also be used to refer to intolerance towards a group of people in general based on their group characteristics such as race , religion , national origin , gender , disability , sexual orientation , and socioeconomic status . 
  i nearly forgot that / r/europe is full of bigots . 
   while shouting allahu akbar what the fuck this has to do with anything ? 
  ** edit *** # 1 * wow , did i hit the nerve for a lot of bigots yesterday ? 
  ooh , was n't aware of that . 
  us troops are already training ukrainian troops since april . 
  like , i do n't know how reuters is so late on this news . 
  bolsheviks who were also russians , you know . 
  russia formed ussr . 
   eu has been the best political development in europe since the fall of the roman empire because roman empire 's genocidal conquests and being in turmoil of many civil wars was a good thing , apparently .
