oh yes . 
  it is a relic from tu\u0111man 's ( 1st president ) rule . 
  basically free points for hdz . 
  interesting how emmigrants feel so patriotic that they left their country and still influence the politics . 
  how can anyone in their right mind support an idea so despicable and tyrannical as an eu army ? 
  is it ? 
   you realize we have dialects in most of europe right ? 
  can you pinpoint exactly which part of my comment implied that ? 
  or just admit you 're making a strawman argument . 
  the groups that can understand each other to a fairly high or medium degree are : 1 . 
  bulgarian , macedonian , serbian , croatian , slovenian , bosnian 2 . 
  czech , slovak , polish 3 . 
  russian , ukrainian , belarussian now , if you had n't noticed - these are seperate and independent languages . 
  not dialects of the same slavic language . 
  not something you can put into your neat little boxes to form a monotone grey mass . 
  these languages , in spite of fairly high mutual intelligibility , have substantial differences in all layers of language which allow to recognize them as independent languages . 
  apart from that , every one of them has an established written standard and a literature of its own - and possesses the status of an official language in respective countries . 
  you could say german and dutch are dialects of one another , or italian , spanish and portugese are just dialects of one another . 
  but they are not . 
   you 're just butthurt and ca n't get over history . 
  yeah , ironic you say that in a sub that bans discussion about the armenian genocide , holocaust and holodomor . 
  https://youtu.be/1fasn9oygdw he is an embarrassment . 
  would be funny if it were not sad seeing a high official so drunk and lacking self control . 
  edit : meant to reply / u/stevenfries, 
  they 're not the same language . 
  they are similar and mutually intelligible , but not the same . 
  and what is wrong about not '' `` admitting '' '' that they 're the same ? 
  even if that is nationalistic , is that bad ? 
   juncker is just trolling , even if he might not call it that . 
  it 's a pretty good troll as well , because some people seem quite triggered . 
  heheh , just like donald over the pond , right ? 
  i guess it is . 
  i have a macedonian keyboard on my phone because the serbian one is in latin ... do n't know what these are : \u0403 \u040c \u040f, 
  i 'll take the bait . 
  in the picture you can clearly see the muscles around his eyes are clearly contracted . 
  that would indicate a sincere smile . 
  but since this picture shows two people from high echelon of politics , i would guess that the smiles are more of a courtesy and politeness , rather than being genuinely happy . 
  taking this in account , we can not know how he actually feels and your original comment is just your projection of your political views with an unhealthy dose of melodrama . 
  as i said , delusional . 
  kajkavski , a croatian dialect :  nigdar je nie videl \u017eute\u0161ega cveta \u010cakavski , a croatian dialect :  nigdi nije vidija \u017eutijeg cvita croatian standard language :  nigdje nije vidio \u017eu\u0107eg cvijeta serbian standar language :  nigde nije video \u017eu\u0107eg cveta , or even better , \u043d\u0438\u0433\u0434\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e \u0436\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0433 \u0446\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 yeah ... it really is the same ... except even some croats ca n't understand each other . 
   literally nothing yeah , about that ... 
  the romanticism some people live in ... 
  the same can be said for the us government . 
  what do you think about obama ? 
  just like winston churchill . 
  not wanting a federation and more centralisation . 
  wanting diversity of nations and the perservation of national identity . 
  that means being ** blinded ** by `` local '' problems and russian propaganda . 
  delusional . 
  it was a ( bad ) joke , but i did n't know this . 
  thanks , til, 
  the clue is in the name . 
  wrong !, 
   croatia  nikola tesla i 'm just waiting for the shitshow . 
  do you pay taxes in the country you live in ? 
  if yes , then vote . 
  you probably do n't pay taxes to other country/countries so why would you have a say in their politics ? 
  coming from a croatian whose diaspora consistently votes for a right wing party that 's been running my country in the ground since independence . 
  yeah , i 'd rather 60000 people lose their jobs than those pesky reds getting hands on it . 
  hmm , maybe one reason would be his agreement on the idea that the south slavs are scum and inferior to the rest of europeans ? 
  op , could you post the source for the numbers ? 
  thanks . 
  now you 've moved the goal posts . 
  you said that he implied that same sex couples ca n't be `` true '' families . 
  now you 're stating that he said that divorces skyrocket if same sex marriages are allowed and that the society will break down . 
  that is not what he said . 
  you 're making things up . 
  as for the shitty assertion : https://carm.org/statistics-homosexual-promiscuity http://www.josephnicolosi.com/an-open-secret-the-truth-about/, 
  no , it does not . 
  you 're looking for something that is n't there . 
  nowhere did he ( _ heavily _ ) imply that same sex couples ca n't be `` true '' families . 
  industrialisation and modernisation which created a need for a mobile and flexible individual , someone who is not bound by 20 relatives and can freely move from town to town in search for a job caused a different , smaller type of family called the nucleus family . 
  furthermore , the concept of marriage and family lose their traditional meaning , as heads of families can not arrange marriages and the individual is free to choose a partner based on romantic feelings . 
  that caused a skyrocket in divorces . 
  that 's a quick explanation of the paragraph you quoted . 
  nothing to do with same sex marriages , as they come in the picture much later . 
  i can source it if you 'd like . 
  edit : words, 
  i ca n't find it . 
  can you quote him ? 
  castells has some good work on the decline of marriage and how it reflects on the society in general . 
  also , why is more than half of your comment about `` family '' when the user you are replying to is talking about `` marriage '' ? 
  he even stated that marriage and family are not seen as one anymore . 
  using that logic france and uk started ww2 . 
   to the uninitiated , za dom spremni ( zds ) is an ustasha chant that 's even illegal in croatia . 
  wrong . 
  you clearly do have a point here and i think that in most of your other comments you are well educated and eloquent , but by god why are you so cringy . 
  i get a weird sort of physical feeling of shame and revolt while reading your comments either here or on r/croatia, 
  i base my opinions on comics , too, 
  yeah , it 's been upon * us * since we started to exist , and it has been upon our planet the moment it was created . 
   and we study that fucking table where on the right you find the negative things fascists did and on the left the positive ( like pensions reform , etc ) . 
  this is a real problem , i think . 
  why do you think this is a problem ? 
  you can only find one explanation * because * you do , in fact , possess a pea brain . 
  that pea brain of yours allows for very patterned and one dimensional explanations such as : i keep replying and arguing against the implication of the aforementioned quote * because * i do n't understand it ; or 28 % of gay men in us have more than 1000 ( one thousand ) sexual partners and that 's actually completely normal and natural because a celebrity said so ; etc. 
  had you transcended into my realm of thinking you 'd realise that fry is , whether you like to admit it or not , implying that homosexuality is ( morally ) ok because other species do it too . 
  if that is not the case then what is even the point of quoting fry ? 
  why not quote trump 's `` i like kfc '' or whatever and be done with it ? 
  well , because quoting someone is used to back up your stance or argument . 
  no one ( except religious extremists et al. ),
