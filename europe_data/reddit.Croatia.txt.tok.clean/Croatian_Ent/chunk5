  ** i can make the same argument about murder . 
  ** i could , in theory , grab a knife and kill the next person i come across . 
  yet i am not in prison . 
  why ? 
  because i did not murder anyone . 
  if you want to tie marriage and procreation so closely together you need to make it law . 
  if you want children , you have to marry and if you want to marry , you must have children . 
  as long as this does n't apply , everyone should have the right to marriage . 
  no , you ca n't make the same argument about murder . 
  my english is not so good to translate `` deliktna sposobnost '' from croatian but it means `` the ability to pay the price for your crimes '' bascially . 
  so , a severely mentally retarded person will not be punished for a crime . 
  same for marriage . 
  a mentally retarded person can not get married . 
  however , straight couples can by definition have children . 
  they can get married and have children , they can have children without getting married , they can get married and not have children and they may not get married and not have children . 
   by your logic , if you do n't plan on getting children , you should n't have the right to have sex . 
  what makes you say that this is my logic ? 
  i never said or implied that . 
  having sex and getting married is optional . 
   and i never claimed they will . 
  you on the other hand claimed that same sex marriage will hinder the growth of mankind . 
  i said it will either hinder or have no impact at all . 
  and i asked if it 's a gamble that we 're willing to take just for a gesture . 
   this entire thread is about germany passing the law . 
  you are arguing about this being a bad thing in this very thread . 
  my bad . 
  i should 've pointed out that i am talking about gay marriage in general , not just in context to germany . 
   men do n't carry the child in their belly and men also do n't give birth to it . 
  a lot of people come to a similar conclusion regarding gay marriages . 
  gay couples are inherently unable to procreate , why would they have a right to the institution of marriage ? 
  considering the fact no one has contested my claims of marriage and procreation being strongly interwined , i 'll go ahead and presume we agree on it . 
   i quoted the whole thing but to be honest , only the first word of it matters . 
  _ technically _ . 
  it 's possible in _ theory _ but if you 'd know anything about germany you would know that this will never happen . 
    this will never happen yeah , that 's how a lot of bad stuff happened . 
  it is a loophole and it is exploitable . 
  found this gem though :  in 2005 , brian kalt , a professor at michigan state university , published an article `` the perfect crime '' describing how no crimes committed in the idaho portion of yellowstone national park would be constitutionally prosecutable because of these constitutional clauses . 
  an excerpt from prof. kalt 's article is below : `` say that you are in the idaho portion of yellowstone , and you decide to spice up your vacation by going on a crime spree . 
  you make some moonshine , you poach some wildlife , you strangle some people and steal their picnic baskets . 
  you are arrested , arraigned in the park , and bound over for trial in cheyenne , wyoming before a jury drawn from the cheyenne area . 
  but article iii , section 2 plainly requires that the trial be held in idaho , the state in which the crime was committed . 
  perhaps if you fuss convincingly enough about it , the case would be sent to idaho . 
  but the sixth amendment then requires that the jury be from the state ( idaho ) and the district ( wyoming ) in which the crime was committed . 
  in other words , the jury would have to be drawn from the idaho portion of yellowstone national park , which , according to the 2000 census , has a population of precisely zero . '', 
   thus , there would be no eligible jury that could convict you for the serious crimes that you have committed , and you could not be constitutionally prosecuted for crimes committed in the approximately 50 square miles of yellowstone national park located in idaho . 
   people wo n't stop making babies because gay people can get married . 
  and straight people wo n't suddenly become gay because that 's not how it works . 
  neither will gay people start making babies ? 
  then what 's the point ? 
  well , it goes both ways . 
   we have paid maternity leave for men in germany so your example is invalid for your argument . 
   you have to be 25 or above to adopt a child in germany . 
  other than that there are no age restrictions for adoption . 
  so again your example does n't work in this case . 
  first of all , believe it or not germany is not the center of the universe . 
  secondly , men do not have maternity leave . 
  they have parental leave . 
  thirdly , to my understanding , there are inequalities in parental leave :  mothers are entitled to full pay during the six weeks before , and eight weeks after , the birth , known as `` mother protection time '' . 
  men do not have full pay six weeks before the child is born , nor eight weeks after . 
  in response to the maximum age for adoption in germany , the practice heavily restricts adoption to people over 40 years of age . 
  and again , germany is not the alfa and omega ( for you though , it may very well be ) , because in croatia , the maximum age is 39 ( adopted child can not be over 18 , the adopters can not be under 21 , and the age difference must be 18 years ; 21 +18 = 39 ) edit : this is just lack of empathy and reason on behalf of german lawmakers . 
  technically , a 90 year old couple can adopt a new born baby , they die in 1 year , the baby can be adopted over and over again until it reaches 18 years of age . 
  by that time , the child would have had 36 foster parents . 
  how would that reflect on the child 's mental health ? 
  peak german efficiency . 
  we really should model our laws after german laws . 
  ca n't argue with that . 
   it exists , and has existed for many other reasons . 
  yes . 
  the main one is procreation . 
   definitions are ours to change . 
  yes . 
  does n't mean we always should . 
   and by that stupid logic , infertile people should not be allowed to marry and all marriages where the woman has gone through menopause and any existing children are adults , should be dissolved . 
  now you go back and read my comment again . 
  read it twice . 
  then come back and read the following : i said that by definition a man and a woman can always procreate . 
  ** by definition ** . 
  by definition , they have the organs which are necessary for procreation . 
  ** by definition ** . 
  infertility is not understood by definition . 
  it is an exception . 
  a worm in an apple is not , by definition , an apple . 
   please explain how exactly are we doing the opposite ? 
  marriage is central to procreation . 
  procreation is only available to heterosexual couples . 
  by giving marriage to non-heterosexual couples , we are nullifying the last atoms of meaning and importance left in the institution of marriage . 
  if there is no same sex marriage , it goes neither here nor there for procreation . 
  if there is same sex marriage , it either hinders procreation or makes no impact at all . 
  making a gamble like that for a symbolic gesture is an incredibly vapid thing to do . 
  edit : bolded words for dum dums, 
  you ** literally ** have the entirety of human knowledge under your fingertips . 
  i wo n't compensate for your laziness . 
  your posting history coincides with your points . 
   tldr : the only thing important in life is popping out babies showing high reading comprehension and a wish to make a meaningful contribution to the discussion . 
   i assume you are practicing what you preach and doing your duty to mankind by making lots of babies , instead of sitting around and getting stoned while playing video games . 
  first of all , the username is a reminder to myself . 
  changed my habits bit by bit . 
  and yes . 
  i will do my part when the time comes .
