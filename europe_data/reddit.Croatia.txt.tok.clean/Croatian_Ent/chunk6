  hopefully 2-3 offsprings spring up . 
   the funny thing is people like you who harp on about same sex marriage being wrong because of `` procreation '' would shit a brick if you accidentally got a girl pregnant . 
  the funny thing is people like you who harp on about prejudice and assumptions and then go on reddit and do exactly those things . 
  yeah , i would shit a brick if i , as you conveniently put it , ** accidently ** got a girl pregneant . 
  is that hypocritical or wrong ? 
  i do not get where you 're coming from . 
  maybe another non sequitur like the rest of your ramblings . 
  edit : you mentioned in one of your comments that r/europe mods banned 2-3 of your accounts . 
  so this is an alt account you use to post on a sub that has banned you ? 
  does that warrant a site-wide ban ? 
  i have a screencap, 
   the difference is that the word `` maternity '' by definition excludes men . 
  now you 're entering a very grey area . 
  by your logic , `` woman '' excludes `` man '' , so what you are stating is that men can not become women and vice versa . 
  is that transphobia ? 
   marriage is a binding contract between spouses , and it 's definition is flexible enough to include gay people . 
  so why should n't we let them do what they want ? 
  there is * no * discernable downside . 
  marriage , from a societal viewpoint , began and continuted to exist only to control , regulate and preserve the obligations and responsibilities of procreation - by definition . 
  a man and a woman can , by definition , procreate . 
  a man and a man or a woman and a woman can only masturbate in company and can not procreate . 
  there is absolutely zero benefit for the society as a whole to make a symbolic gesture towards 2-3 % of the population . 
  any sane and apolitical logician can tell you that . 
  furthermore , it would be more beneficial for everyone ( including lgtb ) to make a symbolic gesture ( the literal bare minimum ) of promoting procreation , because once a society stops procreating it is in a state of extinction . 
  meaning no more gay , straight , bi , lesbian or any kind of human . 
   if you want to desperately cling to the vestiges of a `` traditional '' time rather than accept progress in your country , then the future will not have much else in store for you . 
  sadly , `` progress '' has become a platitude to be thrown around in discussion in order to shame or vilify the other party . 
  you ca n't seem to grasp that without procreation there will be no future . 
  instead of encouraging people to procreate , even symbolically , we do the opposite . 
  is that progress ? 
  perhaps followers of scientism prefer having test tube gub gub babies . 
  a lot of users posted sources and links . 
  if you had a genuine curiousity and really wanted to leave your bubble i could n't have been able to write this reply because you 'd be reading the materials you were given . 
  instead , you are shitposting , refusing to read up on whatever the `` right wingers '' believe , patronizing etc ad nauseam . 
  enjoying your smugness tbh , bye . 
   should men have paid maternity leave ? 
  misandry . 
   should very old people be able to adopt children ? 
  seems like a summary of your thoughts . 
  spare me the prejudiced assumptions . 
  using wikipedia as a source ... 
   not wanting the institution of marriage extended to homosexuals = homophobia keep it rational r/europe, 
  but it was her turn, 
   vox this is my go-to site not just for quality journalism and unbiased reporting , but for philosophy as well !,

  ## q u a l i t y c o n t e n t, 
  http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/27/angela-merkel-caught-on-hot-mic-pressing-facebook-ceo-over-anti-immigrant-posts.html feel free to do some googling yourself, 
   no i am not and i do not think posts critical of terrorism should be removed if they remakn somewhat reasonable . 
  that 's what the op was referring to . 
  remember the new year 's eve in germany in 2016 ? 
  koln ? 
  when actual victims were fined/arrested for identifying the criminals ? 
  when police officers were censored ? 
  zuccbook has a history of removing even posts that are moderate in criticising immigration . 
  maybe a dum dum would write a comment like you did . 
  in case you 're not just baiting or being deliberately obtuse , the op is talking about critical facebook posts about terrorism . 
  as i understand , the `` recruitment posts '' do not come after an attack . 
  what we see after attacks are valid criticisms of immigration laws and immigrants themselves . 
  go back to r/politics, 
  are n't posts visible only after previous ascent from the mods ? 
  one of the mods recently showed screenshots from the interface even mentioning certain keywords which certainly stop the post from showing up without approval . 
  he said `` holocaust '' was one , i 'm guessing `` jihad '' is there as well . 
  are you not doing your job , or is there some mistruths going around ( either here or in the other mod 's comment ) ? 
  okay ... should nato send soldiers to die over there ? 
  not going to watch the entire thing . 
  give me a time stamp, 
  and my first comment was refering to your editorialized title ( wonder why mods do n't take this down , like they do with a lot of other `` editoralized '' titled posts ) , stating that they are simply `` europeans '' . 
  holding a few pieces of paper in their hands will never make them `` european '' , unless they ** fully ** integrate ( even then it is contentious ) . 
  at least in my eyes and everyone else who holds even a tiniest bit of respect for their homeland and the way of their ancestors . 
  this is the worst timeline . 
  you 're most likely pretending to be a dum-dum , or maybe not . 
  either way i 'm not going to debate you . 
  instead , i 'll c/p a comment from this thread by / u/fikifik  `` that person is european '' can plausibly mean at least three different things : \u2022 that person is a citizen of a european country . 
  \u2022 that person is a member of one of the native european ethnic groups . 
  \u2022 that person is culturally european . 
  they are all orthogonal concepts , you can be any of those without being the other . 
  however , people , such as yourself , would like to abolish the latter two , and insist that only the first exists . 
  anyone who talks about the latter two will be constantly questioned , nitpicked at and harangued in an attempt to obfuscate . 
  if i show you an article that says the sun is blue , does it make it true ? 
  it 's called `` populism '' . 
  but this is the right kind , so le upboats to the left, 
  how is he bullying us ? 
  yeah , but do a referendum for it !, 
  `` europeans '' ? 
  if we get a shot of mutti merkel 's multikulti medicine , i 'm signing up for bbb . 
  helping africa to develop and industrialize will help stop global warming ? 
  is this a sick joke ? 
  the amazon rainforest , among other carbon dioxide absorbers is our only hope for an effective , palpable and certain change in the near future . 
  installing solar panels in africa or helping them industrialize is a money siphon as well us shooting ourselves in the leg . 
  he 's goddamn right . 
  we want gibsmedats in order to keep russia as it is . 
  sad state of being . 
  no , no ... 
  i am happy to let them live in their habitat . 
  just not around my house , really . 
  how would you solve it ? 
  that 's fine .
