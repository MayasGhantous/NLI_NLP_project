  i recognize the human nature which can be flawed at times . 
  nevertheless , humans do have an eye for spotting patterns so , personally i 'd factor that in and act accordingly . 
  you walk in the forest ? 
  get yourself some high boots and a stick , or just avoid the snakes . 
  if an arbitrary category is the tendency to kill or injure then you must be objectively correct . 
  i 'm glad you have had a pleasant experience , / u/jewcunt . 
  you are a simpler man ? 
  me see snake . 
  me not know if bad . 
  me not care . 
  me avoid snake anyway . 
  you 're putting words in my mouth . 
  why would i want to get rid of snakes at all ? 
  even venomous ones ? 
  if they 're living in their forest and do not threaten me , i do not see a problem with their existence . 
  you 're projecting . 
  it 's showing . 
  if you read my comment again you can ** clearly ** see that a minority of snakes are venomous . 
   a question commonly asked by those who are concerned about just how many poisonous snakes there are out there is : what percentage of the snake population is considered to be venomous ? 
  this is a somewhat tricky question due to the fact that it is believed that not all varieties of venomous snakes have been discovered yet . 
  to date , however , it is known that 600 species , or twenty five percent of all snake species are poisonous . 
  while not all of these poisonous snakes can be lumped together in to a single family , there are a number of individual species within each family that prove to be venomous . 
  in the section below we will cover a number of these snakes . 
  a white supremacist roleplaying as someone else most likely, 
  i am a simple man . 
  i know a minority of snakes are venomous . 
  i go to forest . 
  i see snake . 
  i do not come near to see if it is venomous . 
  i avoid it completely . 
  redundancy 4 : the part of a message that can be eliminated without loss of essential information, 
  oh it 's facebook ... nevermind . 
  those people wo n't post sources for homophobic claims such as that there 's more homosexuals in traditionalist regions ( implying that homosexuality is learned , and not genetic ), 
  bosniak muslims are a meme . 
  they regularly drink alcohol and eat pork . 
  although , recently extremism is rising in bih . 
  who posted the second comment ? 
  can you link me to it please, 
  is macron going to put a stop to the deforestation of the amazon rainforest in order to help control the climate change which will in turn save the only planet we 've got or throw money at african villagers and keep his fingers crossed ? 
  thanks for the downvotes kind strangers :-) you really brought up good points and are n't doing the climate change deniers a favour ... good on you :-) ) ), 
  he shook trump 's hand harder than trump shook his . 
  i guess that makes macron a `` badass '' , possibly even a good politician !, 
  yeah , i 'd actually like to see this system implemented in the entire eu !, 
  whoa , that so controversial !, 
  anyone else agree with this so we can ostracize and downvote them ? 
  ** big ** change . 
  i really hope it gets banned . 
  i need the salt from croatian news sites ' comment sections my god, 
  this right here is peak european values . 
  look no further , people . 
  whatever happens , as long as it fucks up russia and saudi arabia , is good . 
  what a good person you must be . 
  do n't talk to me anymore . 
   right people/nations what the fuck does that mean ? 
  who has the explicit right to get rich ? 
  and what i meant to say is , it is not certain that people who do get rich off of new energy will be better/good or wo n't use their wealth money for terror/bad things or anything like that which makes them richer as a consequence . 
   my enemies i wish i could live in a movie, 
  yeah because renewable energy will make everything different !, 
  it 's not like some people will monetise it and try to create monopolies or something , right ? 
  there wo n't be any rich people who made their wealth off of energy !, 
  you are skeptical about political neutral moderation ? 
  or freedom of speech ? 
  there must be misunderstandment because you ca n't be serious . 
   by looking at them and seeing if i like them or not . 
   revoke the ban on tabloid newspapers such as the sun or the express . 
  remove the eu flair for the banner . 
   so there can be a eurosceptic in the mod team my candidate . 
  ! remindme 1826 days, 
  also , hdz is now in charge of all three branches of power . 
  the last time that happened we were in for a ride . 
  it 's because he hates 4chan because someone told him it 's bad because people can say whatever they want to say over there , and the things people * want * to say are not the same things these secluded bug chasing weaklings read on their `` news '', 
  now i understand why they say people become like children the older they get . 
  looks like juncker is a few years away from a uterus . 
  remove this !!!!!!!!!!, 
  it goes against r/europe 's preferred candidate !, 
  how about you post le pen as voldemort instead ? 
  by `` incompetent '' i mean old style conservatives whose only difference to leftists are mostly ideological . 
  it 's the same coin ( ties with bankers , globalists , etc ) . 
  only recently has identity politics and nationalism taken place and trump/le pen are just riding the wave . 
  possibly , future politicians will be those who in some way , started the wave . 
  english is not my native language , so i ca n't put my thoughts into words as good as i would like to . 
  stopping/reducing immigration does n't really fix the problem . 
  in cca . 
  20 years , will france still be france if it 's majority of population are africans/arabs ? 
  more drastic measures should be made , ** maybe ** . 
  i agree with your third paragraph . 
  but from my experience right wing parties do have a much closer relationship with nepotism and corruption ( at least in croatia , but in other countries too if i am not mistaken . 
  or perhaps the msm does n't cover left 's corruption as much ), 
  seeing what has happened after trump and brexit , and the fact that le pen 's family is in the party leadership ( open doors to nepotism ) i 'd say that 's incompetence . 
  even though i share some views and would naturally lean towards them , i doubt they 'd get my vote . 
  after all , trump conned the us ... one day he says he 's a nationalist , the other he 's a globalist . 
  `` drain the swamp '' and then `` i am israel 's greatest ally '' . 
  perhaps in a decade or so , the incompetent ones will politically die out and new and young people come . 
  what do you mean ? 
   vice i mean , it 's not like they are the epitome of objective journalism ... a step away from buzzfeed, 
  the former is in some way linked to nihilism . 
  i bet my life on it . 
  the latter is a byproduct of tradition and somewhat conservative culture . 
  i was talking about far-left/right groups being violent . 
  you seem to reject the idea of the far-left being violent .
