  have you seen what is `` antifa '' doing in the us ? 
  what about antifa in germany in the 20th century ? 
  your bias is showing . 
   intellectuals til i am an intellectual if i do not understand economy . 
  or far-left . 
  any `` far '' movement . 
  edit : not far east movement tho, 
  yugoslavia was visited by [ leonid brezhnev ] ( http://imgur.com/a/wpnkl ) . 
  all of the traffic in zagreb had been stopped . 
  my grandparents were in a tram , waiting for more than 30 minutes . 
  suddenly my grandfather turned to my grandmother and said , in a normal speaking voice , `` why do we have to miss our appointments for a hairy monkey '' or something like that . 
  the driver had heard him , left the tram and called the cops . 
  my grandfather was imprisoned for a week and was fined a hefty sum . 
  good times , no ? 
  haha an anonymous board with unlimited free speech wow haha dark side of the internet amirite ? 
  check out the rules of this sub, 
  reading the second part made me feel so uneasy . 
  i had to pause and go for a smoke . 
  the sad things is most people not only in this sub , but in europe are so short-sighted and blisfully unaware of the possibilites . 
  if you state these kinds of thoughts publicly or on reddit you will be called names and labeled racist , nazi et al. 
  aristotle said `` tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of a dying society '' . 
  can you tell me where you got that paragraph from ? 
  they see what they want to see, 
  try harder . 
  you 're becoming stale . 
  your perseverance is outstanding !, 
  love your comment history . 
  / u/foreurope , the `` victim on duty '' of r/europe . 
  / u/wxsted said that * acts * of islamic `` extremism '' are banned , rather than just being a follower of islamic `` extremism '' . 
  acts of ie are usually murders , and murders and banned in civilized countries by default ( meaning not by lex specialis , or any religious law ), 
  this time i posted a reliable article in the english language , as a mod requested . 
  probably a translation error . 
  i really do n't think he meant women will be ** forced ** to wear hijabs . 
  the sad thing is , it 's not an unimaginable question anymore . 
  if someone has a better version please do post it . 
  muh revisionism, 
  radical centrist haha, 
   alt-right `` everyone who sees through my bullshit is a neo nazi !, 
  waaaah waaah it 's just terminology ! '', 
  really cool how you failed to defend your cocky statement ( youre in for a shock xddddd ) and resorted to ad hominem attacks . 
  heheheheheheh i base my political worldview in popular culture references : --------- d le pen is voldemort and macron is harry potter, 
  wait . 
  i 'm confused . 
  you said if someone judges by ethnicity they are a racist . 
  but a racist discriminates by race , not ethnicity . 
  and now you say race * does n't exist * ? 
  can you make up your mind ? 
  maybe stop reading buzzfeed and similar ideology peddling shitty sites . 
  next you will tell me gender does n't exist . 
  who wouldve thunk, 
  ethnicity = race oh man , you have some reading to do . 
  did you remove your comment ? 
   you really think the croats who left and now live in vibrant , exciting cities elsewhere want to come back ? 
  who needs the reality check ? 
  i think i can imagine your worldview when you use common buzzwords as `` vibrant '' . 
   and did n't your country recently bring back some expat croat from canada to fix everything ? 
  how did that work out ? 
  yes . 
  our president is a higher official from nato and a member of a masonic order as stated by her colleague and friend on national television . 
  our prime minister is a bruxelle 's pawn . 
  those are their qualifications . 
  and look how great they 're doing  is n't your diaspora pretty right-leaning anyway ? 
  i thought they all voted to ban gay marriage . 
  that sort of religious bigotry is a terrible way to entice intelligent , creative people to your country . 
  no wonder so many bright young people are leaving . 
  i 'm all for stopping the diaspora from voting . 
  and you talk like an idiot if you thinm that young bright intelligent creative people are leaving because of a referendum to not let gay people get `` married '' but rather have a civil union . 
  notice how i said you sound like an idiot , i did n't call you an idiot because that would be breaking the sub rules . 
   let 's go back to the beginning though . 
  croatia is a mess because of your populist , nationalist , right-winger tudjman thought it would be a good idea to give all the countries wealth to 100 ( 200 ? ), 
  yeah . 
  now you want to double-down on populism and nationalism by closing your borders . 
  good luck with that . 
  the right will just fleece you again . 
  closing borders = populism and nationalism . 
  you 're so bright . 
  all in all , you comment had too much strawmen for me to engage in a conversation . 
  do your research and then ask me to talk to you . 
  just looked it up , marine said banning abortion is not a part of her plan . 
  can you stop pulling stuff out of your ass and actually offer examples to back your point or do you submit to me ? 
  little boy, 
   former soviet country you triggered me for insulting my neighbours . 
  really ? 
  could you link me some sources ? 
  i did n't see or hear anything about mlp or fn fighting against women 's rights .

  what two rich entities are you talking about ? 
  would be more fun if they were ordered by a drunkard from eu to contradict the decision made by representatives of people . 
  i sincerely wish you a good night and do n't forget to drink water . 
  and do n't over-eat tomorrow .
