well there 's this [ lng terminal ] ( http://www.lng.hr/en/ ) that 's apparently going to be built , but knowing all the bureaucratic bs you have to go through here to built something this large it probably wo n't be done for another 20 years . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_croatia_ ( 925 % e2 % 80 % 931102 ), 
  there is a considerable amount of resentment and hate towards serbs , but that is understandable . 
  it 's gon na take a few generations for that to stop and disappear , but enough about that . 
  i live in split , which is a very conservative city . 
  i have never heard anyone , in real life or on the internet , seriously hate bosniaks , slovenes , montenegrins , hungarians or italians . 
  in fact most of the people from those nations are tourists who bring money here , and i really have no idea where or why they would be hated in croatia . 
  you 're making it sound as if croatia is some extremely xenophobic country , yet a large part of the country 's income comes from tourism and every year i read a bunch of compliments from tourists about how nice the locals are to them . 
  other than some extremist fools and hooligans that hate serbs , none of these other nationalities are hated in croatia . 
  i have no idea where you got this from . 
  too bad the majority of the population in these countries are stuck in the last century . 
  incompetent or corrupt politicans know this and they abuse it to gain power , and after that they barely do anything to change or improve the situation . 
  our countries are the prime example why democracy is flawed , but unfortunately there is n't a better alternative . 
  both of those operations were against republika srpska not serbian krajina , during operation storm the croatian army liberated areas under the control of serbian krajina . 
  your president is a declared chetnik leader who collaborated with a known war criminal , and your prime minister called for murder of muslim civilians and you 're telling us what 's shameful ? 
  whataboutism is the act of pointing out hypocrisy , without refuting the opponent 's original argument . 
  i did n't need to refute it because / u/bsarkezi996 already has . 
  what we were talking about was the legality of croatia 's secession from yugoslavia , and the legality of serbian krajina 's secession from croatia . 
  but like i said i 'm tired of the arguing which is why i sha n't continue replying . 
  you know , i spent a good 30 minutes searching wikipedia and other sites for a good reply but then i realised i was wasting time arguing with a person i do n't know about a topic that 's been over for 20 years . 
  during this search i remembered kosovo . 
  if serbs are so good , honorable and innocent , why do n't you show us evil , nazi , ustashe croats who did n't want to recognize serbian krajina how its done and recognize kosovo as a independant country ? 
  i did n't think so . 
  anyway , farewell good sir . 
  it was fun arguing . 
  [ the yugoslav constitution of 1974 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_yugoslav_constitution ) allowed any of the republics to secede freely . 
  `` yugoslavia is defined as a federal republic of equal nations and nationalities , freely united on the principle of brotherhood and unity in achieving specific and common interest , with the right of nations to self-determination up to secession '' also , not to mention the fact that croatia and slovenia offered to keep yugoslavia alive by reorganizing it from a federation to a confederation , but the other countries refused . 
  ca n't say i would mind getting the band back together , 
  it 's some sort of traditional hat worn in the town of sinj ( and its surroundings ) . 
  when asked why he wore it he said : `` i brought it in honor of the people of sinj who chose me '' i suppose it 's sort of nice of him to show gratitude , but it was just so comically out of place . 
  [ why wear those , when you can wear this ... ] ( http://puu.sh/o3zfa/d1eab0b92f.jpg ), 
  the president of croatia is actually working on something like this . 
  [ i made a seperate post so more people could discuss it .

  on second thought , ` egy korona k\u00e9t nemzet ' , right ? 
  we can share all the clay !, 
  ^ just ^ no ^ magyarization ^ pls, 
   having been to ~ ~ burgenland ~ ~ gradi\u0161\u0107e , can confirm . 
  rightful ~ ~ magyar ~ ~ croat clay . 
  ftfy :-) . 
  hehe well it is from memory , and with a small country like this there 's only so many things you can learn in geography without repeating the same stuff every few years . 
  sure !, 
  - the three lion heads represent [ dalmatia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalmatia ) - the one with a marten and a six pointed star ( morning star ) represents [ slavonia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavonia ) - the middle two represent transylvania and hungary . 
  - the two headed eagle represents the [ city of fiume ( rijeka ) ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rijeka ) , which was an important port city and it was heavily contested by italians , hungarians and croats . 
  - the checkerboard represents [ croatia proper . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia_proper ), 
  ah , my mistake i thought the parliament was built earlier . 
  well , i certainly would n't mind some kind of new austro-hungarian state union :-) although i do n't know about the one nation part , i mean even [ jobbik ] ( http://hellodelsomogy.hu/2015/11/22/egy-korona-ket-nemzet/ ) recognizes the two nations . 
  yes , i know the history . 
  also later on the croatian-hungarian settlement happened and croatian lands got some autonomy . 
  i was just saying it feels pretty nice to have your national symbols on that beautiful building . 
  i especially love how [ 4 out of 6 ] ( http://puu.sh/lwdqc/1db85ce920.png ) coat of arms above the entrance are croatian . 
  it kind of makes up for how plain ours is . 
   not to mention serbia was not even involved in bosnia . 
  [ \u0160e\u0161elj says otherwise .

  hey i wanted to ask someone who lives in austria about the [ schwarz-gelbe allianz . 
  ] ( http://sga.monarchisten.org/ ) how are they seen in public ? 
  are they well known ? 
  were they part of the last elections ? 
  there 's actually a party in austria who wants to restore the habsburg monarchy . 
  [ the gold-black alliance . 
  ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fsga.monarchisten.org%2f&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ), 
  calm down lol . 
  i meant something like [ this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_greater_austria ), 
  well , i was n't really being serious , but i meant something more like [ this . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_of_greater_austria ) . 
  ehhh ... no , thanks . 
  if we have to rebuild a federation , i would n't mind austria-hungary . 
  hungary is a good ally too , however the relations are a bit strained lately , mostly because of our ridiculous goverment . 
   also did n't britain recognize croatia early on too ? 
  well ... ` helmut kohl requested immediate recognition of croatia in the bundestag on 4 september 1991 . 
  germany was criticized , mostly by united kingdom , france and the netherlands , that its rapid recognition of croatia would aggravate finding peace settlement . ', 
  ' on 10 october 1991 , two days after the croatian parliament confirmed the declaration of independence , the eec decided to postpone any decision to recognize croatia for two months . 
  german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher later wrote that the eec decided to recognize croatian independence in two months if the war had not ended by then . 
  with the war still ongoing when the deadline expired , germany presented its decision to recognize croatia as its `` policy and duty '' . 
  german position was fully supported by italy and denmark . 
  france and the uk attempted to prevent german recognition of croatia by drafting a united nations resolution requesting that no country take unilateral actions which might cause the situation in yugoslavia to get worse . ', 
  [ source . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93germany_relations ), 
  i would say germany . 
  germany was the first big western country to immediately take a stand and support croatia 's independence in the 90 's . 
  they were one of the strongest advocates of the croatian accession to nato and the european union . 
  also worth noting , there are n't as many people here resenting germanys immigrant policy due to the fact that germany accepted lots of croat refugees during the yugoslav wars , as well as economic immigrants later . 
   it was dying even before ww1 [ not really . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/3q56w7/was_austriahungary_in_decline_preww1/ ), 
  that one is very biased . 
  it was made by a canadian serb . 
  if you 're really interested , bbcs `` the death of yugoslavia '' series is much better . 
  you are clearly very ignorant of this topic . 
  the fact is that the serb krajina occupied 1/3 of the territory of croatia . 
  in april 1991 the population of that territory was 52 % serbs and after ethnic cleansing by july 1992 it had 88 % serbs . 
  calling this disgusting act `` self-determination '' is fucking ridiculous . 
  it is literally no different than croatia today annexing all of bosnia with the help of bosnian croats and then calling it `` self-determination '' since it would have around 55 % croats , and then after that commiting ethnic cleansing for a few years until it has 80 % + croats . 
  finally here 's a quote from a president of the serb krajina milan babi\u0107 that he said on trial :  i come before this tribunal with a deep sense of shame and remorse . 
  i have allowed myself to take part in the worst kind of persecution of people simply because they were croats and not serbs .
