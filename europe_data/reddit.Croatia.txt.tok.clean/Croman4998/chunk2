  the regret that makes me feel , the pain that i have to live with the rest of my life . 
  i ask my brothers , croats , to forgive their serb brothers . 
  i beg for my serbian people to put the past behind them and to turn to the future where good , compassion and justice will , in some way , lessen the results of evil in which i participated . 
  well to be fair i would n't call hdz-most government the same as the one where sanader had free reign to fuck the country up . 
  the 2015 government collapsed because thats what karamarko tried to do and now his political career is dead . 
  though i agree hdz still has far more power than it should, 
  i think it will . 
  unlike karamarko who was possibly corrupt with mol , and wanted to assume full control which most and ore\u0161kovi\u0107 did n't allow so the government collapsed , plenkovi\u0107 is a diplomat and spent a lot of time in the eu parliament so i doubt he is corrupt . 
  his closest associates are quite fresh faces like mari\u0107 , maleti\u0107 , stier ... 
  well the quote does n't exactly point out if ah won or lost , it just says that franz joseph thought he would lose . 
  anyway he died in 1916 before it was known that ah would lose ww1 so that would n't work either . 
  i do n't think that 's what he meant . 
  invading serbia is n't exactly an uprising . 
  he was probably refering to the [ herzegovina uprising ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herzegovina_uprising_ ( 1875 % e2 % 80 % 9377 ) or the [ austro-hungarian campaign in bosnia and herzegovina in 1878 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-hungarian_campaign_in_bosnia_and_herzegovina_in_1878 ) or the [ bosnian crisis ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_crisis ) . 
  one of those sounds more likely than ww1 . 
  based on the 1910 austrian census , in dalmatia 610 000 people spoke serbo-croatian and only 18 000 spoke italian and in istria 41.6 % spoke serbo-croatian and 13.7 % spoke slovene while 36.5 % spoke italian . 
  saying that the whole area down to montenegro being majority italian speaking is just wrong . 
  source : [ 1 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_dalmatia#1910 ) , [ 2 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istria#demographic_history ), 
  yeah because a president , whose position is way more expensive than a monarch , is much better . 
  wasting taxpayer money and manipulating the nation every 4/5 years for a practically symbolic position . 
  and do n't tell me how it 's `` unfair '' that one family has power and their offspring gets to rule because of their ancestors . 
  is it fair that some people are born in shitty slums and they have to live their life in poverty , while some get born so rich that even if they wanted to spend all their money they could n't ? 
  no it is n't because life is n't fair and it never will be . 
  objectively a constitutional monarch is better than a president , but people are subjective and they would rather throw away money so they could pat themselves on the back about how democratic they are and how anyone can be president even though that is not true . 
  only rich people , people with rich sponsors , or people who are in top of political parties and closely follow their program can become one which automatically excludes the majority of population . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_wine read up . 
  hey could you annex croatia too ? 
  we could use some western european leadership for a few decades . 
  thanks for the info , 
  terrible news . 
  hopefully the remains of kaiser karl i. 
  wo n't be damaged . 
  [ well we are the only other major catholics in the balkans and we love you guys < 3 ] ( http://puu.sh/qtnqp/76d645ddd6.jpg ), 
  here 's a [ comment ] ( http://puu.sh/qpqjz/bcb6a862ed.png ) i saved from last year explaining it . 
  well your government is a bit hypocritical seeing as they had no problem rehabilitating dra\u017ea mihailovi\u0107 who himself wanted to [ work with stepinac ] ( https://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/dra%c5%beino_pismo_stepincu ) against communists . 
  if he is a war criminal like you 're saying then should n't dra\u017ea mihajlovi\u0107 also be considered one for this ? 
  i mean the same people tried dra\u017ea and stepinac yet dra\u017eas is considered political and untrue , but stepinac ' is 100 % true ? 
  can you explain that logic ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amiel_shomrony https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/miroslav_%c5%a0alom_freiberger look at the reactions for his trial : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aloysius_stepinac#reactions even winston churchill himself said that the process was purely political and there was no justice there . 
  now years later the serbian fm is comparing the rehabilitation of stepinac to rehabilitation of hitler thereby practically shitting all over churchills words . 
  this whole serbian attack on stepinac is purely political bullshit that is meant to make it seem like croats are worshiping some nazi bloodthirsty fascist . 
   all men and all races are children of god ; all without distinction . 
  those who are gypsies , black , european , or aryan all have the same rights ( ... ) for this reason , the catholic church had always condemned , and continues to condemn , all injustice and all violence committed in the name of theories of class , race , or nationality . 
  it is not permissible to persecute gypsies or jews because they are thought to be an inferior race . 
   i consider it my bishop 's responsibility to raise my voice and to say that this is not permitted according to catholic teaching , which is why i ask that you ( ante paveli\u0107 ) undertake the most urgent measures on the entire territory of the independent state of croatia , so that not a single serb is killed unless it is shown that he committed a crime warranting death . 
  otherwise , we will not be able to count on the blessing of heaven , without which we must perish . 
  wow what an asshole , literally just as bad as hitler !, 
  the `` un-conviction '' refers to the fact that he was convicted by a communist show trial . 
  hitler killed himself before any trial could occur . 
  you should educate yourself before posting stupid comments like this . 
  split , croatia [ the prettiest building ] ( http://imgur.com/5ffy7gz ) - saint domnius cathedral . 
  it was originally a mausoleum for the roman emperor diocletian , who was one of the last roman emperors to persecute christians . 
  it was built in the 4th century . 
  ~ ~ later in 1100 christians made it into a church and built the belltower . ~ ~ actually it was turned into a church in the 7th century . 
  the belltower was constructed in 1100 . 
  [ the ugliest ] ( http://imgur.com/914qoly ) - i thought about putting a commie block since there 's lots of them here , but instead i decided to go for something more recent . 
  this is a sports/entertainment arena that was built for the 2009 handball championship . 
  now it looks pretty ugly as it 's supposed to be , but the fact that money ran out and it still is n't finished and looks like [ this ] ( http://imgur.com/a/rjw6d ) on one side makes it so much worse . 
  edit : typos/grammar, 
  the question is who are the greatest people of your country not your nation . 
  lost soul here . 
  please take us back , everything went wrong after we left . 
  we also had german speaking kings for almost 400 years and we were on germanys side in ww1 . 
  relations with italy are fine now , but they spent most of the 20th century trying to annex our coast so people do n't really consider them as great friends . 
  charles i of hungary was also the croatian king and not to mention that a croat baron paul \u0160ubi\u0107 convinced him to claim the throne of hungary . 
  if he did n't become the king hungary might not 've even participated on that meeting . 
  i read somewhere that croatia was offered a membership in v4 early on , but our dumbass government declined it . 
  edit : also forgot to mention that there we were ruled by 3 jagellion kings and one of them was also a king of poland and the same time ( w\u0142adys\u0142aw iii . 
  croats , italians and austrians are the same people divided by language . 
  serbs , romanians and bulgarians are the same people divided by language . 
  bosniaks , albanians and turks are the same people divided by language . 
   what does serbia have to do with all of this . 
  gavrilo was a yugoslav nationalist and a native to bosnia . 
  because gavrilo was a stupid idealist kid who thought the assassination would lead to freedom and equality for south slavs , but got used as a tool by the nationalist black hand which was a group that knew very well what franz ferdinand political ideas were and they knew they would get in the way of greater serbia and serbian domination of other peoples in the region . 
   reading all of the declarations from zagreb and split in 1918 about the unification of south slavs into one state ( not serbia ! , but a mutual kingdom ) makes me think otherwise . 
  this was only after the war had been going on for 4 years , people were starving and tired of war and they blamed austria for it . 
  [ here read about the reactions to the assassination and the resulting anti-serb pogoroms , riots and lootings . 
  ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/franjo_ferdinand#reakcije_na_sarajevski_atentat_u_trojednoj_kraljevini_hrvatske.2c_slavonije_i_dalmacije )  also , the black hand , which princip was a member of , had serbian , croat and muslim members and affiliates . 
  nobel prize wining croat ivo andric to name one . 
  princip was n't a member of the black hand and neither was ivo andri\u0107 . 
  they were members of young bosnia which was a group of people who believed what princip believed . 
  you have to understand the difference between the black hand and young bosnia . 
  the black hand was a serb nationalist organization that wanted to destroy austria so they would be able to annex areas they considered to be serbian ( some with ethnic serbs , some with bosniaks/croats ) which were in austria . 
  it also had the support of the serbian government . 
  the young bosnia was a group of idealist pro-yugoslav students who wanted a yugoslav state free of any monarchs ( habsburg or kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 ) with freedom and equality for all south slavs . 
  franz ferdinand did n't like slavs , but he also really did n't like hungarians who he believed had too much power in the country . 
  to counter that he was ready to give autonomy to the southern slavs , presumably the capital of this autonomous south slav region would be zagreb because he was a hardcore catholic , and croats were for the most part loyal to the habsburgs . 
  he was also the only person at the top of austria who was heavily against war with serbia because he knew of its ties to russia . 
  the black hand did n't like this as their goal was to expand serbian territory and domination . 
  so what do they do ? 
  they find idealistic students with radical ideas in the young bosnia group , they convince them that assassinating franz ferdinand will lead to freedom , and they give them the weapons to do it . 
   slim ... we ai n't gots no money for dat shiet brah . 
  presidential elections cost more than keeping a monarch . 
  as for royal residences , they 're still a cultural good so the upkeep money does n't really depend on whether it 's a republic or a monarchy . 
  there was also the carevka , which was the [ croatian translation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/translations_of_gott_erhalte_franz_den_kaiser#croatian ) of the austro-hungarian [ ` gott erhalte franz den kaiser ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06643umejzg&amp;ab_channel=monomah1389 ) , although i do n't know if it was ever used officialy . 
  tykzz asked about croat vs serb rivalry that left2die mentioned and the first and ** only ** thing you say is :  austrians / / hungarians used to flame the conflict between serbs and croats ie divide an conquer centuries ago , and some of the mofos fell for it . '', 
  to someone who does n't know about this topic like tykzz this implies that austria/hungary are the main reason it happened and grew into what it is which is misinformation . 
  so i decided to point out historical facts not `` whine '' . 
   why do n't you go to a library and read some books , go through archives carefully . 
  why do n't you actually list which books you think i need to read instead of this lame deflection ?
