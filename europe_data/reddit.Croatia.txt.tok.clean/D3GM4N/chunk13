   no trumpists are there really that many `` trumpists '' in sweden ? 
  what is the exact position of nyheter idag ? 
  i do n't think that `` saving the ** global ** environment '' works this way . 
  but it simply is a country :d, 
  had to doublecheck if this post is from u/crnaruka . 
  bombing cities and villages is exactly that . 
   nothing justifies terrorist actions in discriminately targeting civilian population this is true . 
  but the answer to terror attacks should not be attacking the civil population just because they and the pkk belong to the same ethnic group . 
  i do n't think that you can compare the damage of a terror arrack to the damage a military can cause . 
  both are horrible but miles away in terms of casualties . 
   ca n't believe people are being sympathetic to terrorist . 
  i do n't all i say is that the turks only see the positives on their side . 
  the fact that their army fucks up kurd cities and villages to `` fight terrorism '' does not matter as much when they think about `` pros '' and `` cons '', 
  for you maybe ... 
  the only people who really pay for this mess are the kurds . 
  u/emmel said :  the way i see it turkey is at least as guilty in this conflict . 
  which is true . 
  these terror groups do n't pop out without any reason . 
  turkey should think about what caused the problem in the first place . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i support abortion in the first couple of weeks or when the health of the mother is in danger . 
  everything after these couple of weeks is killing though . 
  i would be patient with this statement . 
  there is a a living baby `` inside someone else 's body '' after ~ 8 weeks . 
  it would also be okay to kill the child just before the birth by your logic . 
  losing 3 times in a row was not enough i guess : i, 
  the turkish army is n't innocent either when it comes to dealing with kurds . 
   those countries were already better off . 
  poland for example was in a horrible state before the eu . 
   sony a7s ii ... not with the average in serbia . 
  croats of course . 
  wtf ?!? 
  why is he the catholic nazi . 
  we are as catholic as poland :(, 
  let 's be like makedonia and claim every bit of italian history as our own . 
  we will begin by renaming our country to republic of venice . 
  what i mean to say is that there would still be a reason to have children even if you are selfish . 
  i personally believe that the best thing you can achieve is to raise your children . 
  children change everything as soon as they are born and a part of your life . 
  but you are wasting your one chance by being completely useless to everyone else . 
  are you not interested in being remembered by at least a couple of generations . 
  idk ... 
  it is really concerning that this stupid cunt is able to get this many votes . 
  more or less . 
  i went to a catholic private school in vienna and the only religious stuff was that we had a cross in every room and that some of the teachers where nunn 's . 
  i ca n't really complain tbh . 
  this is as sad as it is awesome : /, 
  d\u00f6ner kebap was invented in germany . 
  i 'm not even shure if the inventor was a turk . 
  they just want to be as glorious as croatia . 
  we did it !, 
   but should n't a ** good ** politician put their country over their career ? 
  ftfy, 
  every idiot was able to see what the pro-brexit parties did tbh . 
  the weak pro-eu parties and the horrible media did the rest . 
  usa = superpower with a retarded leader russia = `` superpower '' with a retarded leader finland = ? 
  bosniaks want to have their own language . 
  i do . 
  we wanted to be like big brother germany so bad !, 
  bosnia is bro < 3, 
  no problem . 
  call hungary and gib money . 
  could someone ban this guy ? 
  he constantly tries to provoke people . 
  accept they are not . 
  they are the most advanced military power in the world . 
  to compare them to china is an insult . 
  you do n't have to like the usa but do n't make things up . 
  i take this for granted tbh . 
  free movement should be absolutely normal in any modern country . 
  and thats why we call you bromenia !, 
  i like you . 
  here take this < 3, 
  [ yeah !,

  we always managed to hold the front against the turks and poland saved austrias ass during the 2nd siege of vienna . 
  we used to like them before you guys turned them into angry turks . 
  remember me and poland the next time you try to bully europe !, 
  we are not serbia . 
  if we say that we remove `` fucking kebap pig scum shit dirt '' from our territory ... we mean it . 
  thanks yankee , 
  not at all . 
  what i say is that believing in god alone does not mean that you are a religious person . 
  but he caused the current political situation . 
  for example : i know many people who would say that they believe in some kind of god and thats it . 
  they do n't go to church . 
  they have nothing to do with other religious institutions and so on . 
  you do n't need to be religious to believe in god though . 
  we will call it ze `` fl\u00fcchtlingsschreck '' . 
  the guys on the right must be a couple of foreigners . 
  ca n't hear you . 
  fuck that . 
  they are not even allowed to drink alcohol . 
  slavic countries ( + / - serbia and russia ) usually get along with each other . 
  great times for us buddy , 
  since we use to point this out wherever it is possible : the necktie . 
   if his referendum succeeds do you think he will fail ? 
  we got your back buddies :d, 
  i have never seen such a person on this sub tbh . 
  it is not a double standard if most of the people who lived during ( or even fought in ) the war are still alive and think that they did nothing wrong and deserve to be independent .
