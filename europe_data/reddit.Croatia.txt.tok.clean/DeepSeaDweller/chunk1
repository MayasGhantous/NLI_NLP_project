lots of components of banned or restricted substances are naturally consumed or produced by the body , the problem is quantity and concentration . 
  edit : and timing/context of circulation within the body . 
  i see , thanks . 
  catholic christmas . 
  orthodox christmas is in early january . 
  edit : i stand corrected . 
  and i guess i forgot about protestants . 
  borders must be defined at accession , he might be thinking of that . 
  for example , a condition of our accession was to settle our border dispute with slovenia ( which we agreed to send to arbitration ) . 
  a condition of serbia 's accession is to relinquish all claims to kosovo . 
  germany was comparatively far stronger economically at the time than romania currently is and it cost them a lot . 
  they 're still feeling some effects of all the investment into east germany after reunification with some wage issues in the west . 
  but wrestling bears and hiking shirtless through siberia cures all ailments with pure testosterone and russian soul . 
  world leaders hate him !, 
  they are n't doing anything about it , they 're just making excuses for stupid behavior they already engage in . 
  this does n't really follow what other posts are mentioning and is just in the city i 'm from but we have road signs at the same intersections that will point one way for * trst * ( trieste in croatian ) and * trsat * , a city district . 
  what about judaism ? 
  it 's a pretty well-known phrase worldwide and is used by leftists and anarchists in music and protests . 
  same with [ `` death to fascism , freedom to the people '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/death_to_fascism,_freedom_to_the_people ) which comes from the yugoslav partisans . 
  unlikely considering the timeline of slavic history . 
  except for the macedonians , they were there way before anyone else . 
  what are north serbian catholics ? 
  are they anything like jewish ugandans ? 
  the plural is only if you 're naming the currency . 
  in practice , it 's ` number ' * eura * . 
  a mock agglutinative language . 
  airplane gestures against manchester united , chants of `` murderers '' against liverpool , hissing against spurs ( a favorite of fringe elements within west ham and chelsea support ) . 
  those that resort to them are in the extreme minority , but they still exist . 
  the [ leading croat politician during that period ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stjepan_radi%c4%87 ) was shot and killed * in a parliament session * by a serbian politician from montenegro . 
  banovinas were rigged , essentially [ gerrymandered ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gerrymandering ) , to guarantee serb majorities in each , that is , until the compromise which created a croatian banovina on the eve of wwii . 
  none of that excuses what was done , but these are things that sparked such extremist beliefs . 
  also , the usta\u0161a were not a well-supported group when their regime was set up by the axis nations . 
  what ensued also generated a very large insurgency , even among ethnic croats . 
  there are some absolutely vile english chants and other supporter actions , even today . 
  you probably have n't seen/heard them ... 
  remove the spotlight from what ? 
  it was an unsurprisingly hostile , yet manageable , crowd until a stupid provocation and even stupider overreaction on the albanian players ' part . 
  right , because dietitian and fitness trainer are among the health minister 's job responsibilities . 
  others have said she has proven to be quite competent in her prior position . 
  if she can help prevent ebola coming to belgium and positively affect medical education , research , practice , whatever during her stint , i hope you 'll be able to excuse her weight . 
  you forgot the scariest one of all , the dreaded [ propuh ] ( http://zablogreb.blogspot.com/2012/12/propuh-or-great-cultural-chasm-between.html ) . 
  whoop , there it is . 
  as / u/martelfirst mentioned , if borders were redrawn in which enclaves and isolated groups are inevitable , a potential solution would be guarantees of rights for ethnic minorities and perhaps some other measures to pacify these groups . 
  i 'm just not sure if any of the states in the area are capable of sticking with such promises ( because the right inevitably wins and holds parliament every so often ) . 
   i have also not mentioned any sort of joining with serbia in any of my comments . 
  this entire discussion started with a post that asked why secession should or should not happen . 
  i was running on the assumption of rs to serbia vs. status quo . 
   except that the crimes did not really change demographics to the point where it 's totally different than the one in the past . 
  sure there are some areas that are completely deprived of one ethnicity or the other but overall situation did not change a lot . 
  yes , i 'm sure the green areas in the 1991 map you linked that are now in the rs are still full of bosniaks that would love to join serbia . 
  just in theory if a larger port were to be built in scandinavia to handle arctic traffic , it would be way north , more likely on the mainland , and in a relatively flat area . 
  narvik would be a tremendous pain to build proper infrastructure to and nordkap is on what looks like a very rugged island . 
  i do n't mean this as an inflammatory post , but in the eyes of many bosniaks secession validates the ethnic cleansing committed against them during the war . 
  it is true that a lot of the current rs was previously a serb-majority area but there were a lot of bosniaks forced out of those areas as well . 
  i 'm not really sure where i stand myself , it 's none of my business so i try not to concern myself with it . 
  while i can see that dissolution is the pragmatic approach ( though it does n't promise any improvement for any of the territories ) , there 's a lot of history that should n't be ignored . 
  more likely somewhere like alta where rail and better road links would be easier to establish . 
  [ tru dat ] ( http://weknowmemes.com/generator/uploads/generated/g135975877593782965.jpg ), 
  inbreds  jews , ` mirite ? 
  there is nothing nicer than one of these early in the morning . 
  it 's near impossible to miss . 
  it was briefly a [ free state ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_state_of_fiume ) after wwi and then [ split along the middle ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/granica_izme\u0111u_rijeke_i_su\u0161aka_1937.jpg ) between italy and yugoslavia . 
  the [ former border ] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/granica_su\u0161ak_rijeka_1925.jpg ) is [ a few blocks away ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=rijeka,+croatia&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=45.32658,14.448395&amp;spn=0.004941,0.009645&amp;sll=38.804821,-77.236966&amp;sspn=2.786557,4.938354&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=rijeka,+primorje-gorski+kotar+county+%c5%beupanija,+croatia&amp;z=17&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=45.326614,14.448281&amp;panoid=hpsmdwntsslfdegutysk1w&amp;cbp=12,175.77,,0,11.54 ) from where i stay when i visit . 
  well , the radical catholic and radical orthodox christians are n't helping any either . 
  it depends on where you go . 
  most tourist-heavy areas did n't see any fighting ( big exception is dubrovnik ) . 
  areas in the dalmatian hinterland and slavonia still have scars . 
  vukovar has retained its shelled water tower as a monument . 
  hungary 's only port was fiume/rijeka , which went on to grow even further in the post-wwii period ( interwar period was n't fun ) . 
  it then declined after independence due to not being able to shift markets and due to the malicious systematic dismemberment of its primary shipping line . 
  orban ca n't be any worse than milanovic . 
  to be fair , if they wanted to get into politics they had to enter the communist party . 
  the border with slovenia is about 25 minutes away and italy is about an hour away . 
  during yugoslavia , people would go to trieste to do their shopping because they had far more western goods . 
  fun fact : people from all over yugoslavia would do this but cars with local license plates were less likely to be checked when re-entering the country so proximity was an advantage for multiple reasons . 
  vaccines are generally prophylactic ( preventative ) . 
  they can be used as treatments but i do n't see how it would be useful in this case . 
  should europe start ` worrying ? ', 
  slavic languages take it a step further which is why russian can be so difficult for english speakers . 
  on the other hand , speaking croatian ( and the other close languages ) has made polish relatively easy for me to pick up in the limited time i 've spent on it . 
  yeah , i took french for a while and the spelling and pronunciation can be wonky but it seems to follow some rules or trends ( as silly as they can be ) . 
  english approaches absurdity , especially with * ( ou ) gh * . 
  it depends on which language ( s ) the learner already knows . 
  also , english spelling is atrocious . 
  and let 's keep in mind that we 're discussing ukrainians learning language ( s ) . 
  i 'm inclined to believe it 's easier for them to pick up russian than english . 
  and what part of what i said is revisionism ? 
  i have absolutely no sympathy for anyone who supported the usta\u0161a regime but i 'm tired of those who like to equate croats with it and the ideas it espoused and choose to ignore our contribution to the anti-fascist effort . 
  serbs cry foul every time a someone plays the serbs = milo\u0161evi\u0107 , karad\u017ei\u0107 , mladi\u0107 , nedi\u0107 , etc. , etc. 
  card and with reason . 
  i do n't understand how this is any different . 
  the first anti-fascist detachment in europe was started in croatia and croats accounted for the largest fraction of the partisans for a significant part of the war . 
  also , let 's not ignore the candid relationship the \u010cetniks had with occupying forces . 
  hungary and russia experienced communism very differently . 
  it * is * surprising . 
  a former kgb agent in a ( far ) right party in a country where the left and communism are vilified ? 
  that 's not very typical .
