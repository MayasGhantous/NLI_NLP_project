  that 's true , i had n't really considered those factors . 
  i still think , perhaps hope , that they are aware enough of the peril they put themselves in for the chance to seek a better life and opportunity for themselves . 
  i would be more inclined to call them desperate , not stupid . 
  agreed , though the character changes a bit with the croatian-montenegrin border due to demographics ( some changes occurred in the most recent war , but nothing compared to most other areas that underwent them in the same period ) . 
  it is rich and i do agree that we should cherish it , but i 'm not a fan of dividing it . 
  croatian has slowly been bastardized over the last 20 years in order to make it ` more croatian ' and less serbian or serbo-croatian . 
  * \u0160etali\u0161te * is now * \u0161etnica * , we almost got crap like * vrtolet * and * zrakomlat * , and countless others . 
  perhaps some of the words that are coming back into usage were popular in some other era , but they were/are artificially re-introduced for political reasons . 
  i know what it is , i have roots in the area . 
  i just do n't think it 's worthy of a new letter among all of the various dialects that the area has in which none has demanded a new letter . 
  \u0106 is sometimes pronounced in a completely different way in the kvarner area yet there is no novel letter for it . 
  * ^ ^ ^ and ^ ^ ^ i ^ ^ ^ did n't ^ ^ ^ downvote ^ ^ ^ your ^ ^ ^ previous ^ ^ ^ post . 
   montenegrin latin is based on serbo-croatian latin , with the addition of the two letters \u015a and \u0179 , to replace the digraphs sj and zj [ montenegrin alphabet ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montenegrin_alphabet ), 
  there 's a difference between sounds and letters existing in language . 
  there is no letter in english for ` th ' but the sound exists anyway . 
  i just think it 's silly to add letters to accommodate dialectic differences in pronunciation . 
  to add to this , montenegrins have for a long time been stereotyped as lazy . 
  the two letters they have introduced are just lazy versions of \u0161 and \u017e . 
  it is a noticeable part of some of their speech , but it 's quite silly to add two completely new letters for it . 
  then again , i should n't be one to talk , croatia has had some moronic additions over the last 20-odd years . 
  i would say it is only a cultural difference when you reach the divide between coastal and upland montenegro . 
  in 1918 , this was the de facto line between the greens ( pro-independence ) and whites ( pro-union ) during the short-lived conflict over the question of union with serbia . 
  coastal montenegro is heavily italian-influenced and , excuse the biased term , more cultured . 
  upland montenegro for a long time operated under extremely patriarchal clan politics . 
  it is a rough and rugged terrain that produces rough and rugged people . 
  however , with improving infrastructural links , a lot of these differences have been blurred by the movement of people . 
  having said that , i think the divorce of serbia and montenegro was more of a political decision than a cultural one . 
  except balkan slavs are divided by religion , script , and historical spheres of influence - three critical factors in the development of culture . 
  certain single countries have quite drastic changes in culture . 
  there 's a significant difference between the coastal and the continental in croatia , the coastal and the upland in montenegro , vojvodina and the the far south of serbia . 
  why ? 
  because they 've been held by different empires who have left their own cultural contributions behind . 
  venice and italy along the adriatic coast , austria-hungary in the northern continental areas , the ottomans in the southern continental areas . 
  and i can understand just about as much polish as i can bulgarian and that 's if i 'm reading it . 
  with speech it 's even less . 
  bosnia and herzegovina is run by dozens of nutjobs who hold it in a political stalemate over every issue . 
  * mirna bosna * peace in/peaceful bosnia means ` done deal ' or ` everyone 's happy . ', 
  \u010ce\u0161ki ... why are you asking me ? 
   most of them are not only tall but large , as well ( probably same with all ex-yugo countries ) . 
  the [ dinaric alps ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dinaric_alps ) which run through albania , bosnia-herzegovina , croatia , kosovo , macedonia , montenegro , serbia , and briefly slovenia produce , on average , the tallest people on earth . 
  definitely not the former , not sure if the latter is true either . 
  not entirely sure why water polo has been brought up at all . 
  \u010ce\u0161ka then it gets kinda weird with people and objects . 
  i mean . . 
  i do n't understand any of this . 
  * great music - yugo rock of the 70s and 80s ( bijelo dugme , plavi orkestar , zabranjeno pu\u0161enje ) , sevdalinke , * not * [ herzegovinian ganga ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2hfpypattg ) music * self-deprecating humor - mujo i haso jokes ; in the movie no man 's land , a guy in a trench during the war is reading the newspaper and says ` oh man , you should see the shit happening in rwanda . ', 
  * great food - best grill on the planet : \u010devapi / \u010devap\u010di\u0107i , pljeskavica - burek , of course , although they can be purists about it and will refer to each variety by its own name - * burek * will only refer to a burek with mince meat , * sirnica * ( or * pita * ? 
  i ca n't remember ) is a burek with cheese , * zeljanica * is burek with spinach - personally i just refer to them as burek with * ingredient * * [ `` bosnian pyramids '' ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bosnian_pyramids ) - not really pyramids , as far as i 'm concerned * bosnian muslims have historically been quite liberal as far as muslim rules go . 
  most notably , they drink alcohol ( rakija is their second god ) . 
  only recently have influences from more strict and radical muslim areas crept into the country , mostly from saudia arabia , a financier of a number of religious building projects in the country . 
  * the nature is beautiful , it 's just not yet completely safe to explore . 
  having said that , i 'm annoyed by the ` make sure not to wander off the beaten path or you 'll hit a minefield ' comments that i see on reddit a lot . 
  they 're not * everywhere * . 
  * pretty women and they 're all ready to be better wives and mothers by the age of 18 than many others at 50 . 
  fact . 
   one of the big losers of the yugoslav wars ( srebrenica comes to mind ) who was n't a big loser ? 
  independence aside , pre-war populations and industry were ravaged and have yet to recover . 
  perhaps slovenia but their involvement in the war was a week long . 
  research is funded by grants , not tuition fees . 
  western flame can not into handling superior russian gas . 
  depends on how you look at it . 
  one thing 's for sure , albanians did not build christian orthodox places of worship or monasteries . 
  in croatia i believe it is required by law to put an ad in the paper for a position . 
  the thing is , it is often `` known '' who will get a job before the position is officially open . 
  then sometimes the employer will place the ad in an obscure paper that is printed and read in some other part of the country . 
  i 've only heard horror stories about the job application process in croatia , if you can even say there is one with a straight face . 
  starbucks , apparently . 
  anecdotally , i 'm sure croatia is very high on the cafes per capita list , but i 've heard from quite a few people that they wish they had a starbucks and that they always go there when they see one in another country . 
  i live in the us where there 's a starbucks on every corner and i long for a cafe with an outdoor terrace where they do n't implicitly tell you to piss off if you have n't ordered any food . 
  burek and cevapi , of course . 
  northern italy is still quite central european-y . 
  while i 'm sure the south consumes a decent amount of beer , it is heavily wine-producing . 
  and as i have only discovered relatively recently , inexpensive good stuff . 
  trader joe 's is a godsend . 
  the quality beers like o\u017eujsko and karlova\u010dko cost about 80-90 cents for 0,5 l if you buy the glass bottles . 
  i 'd say that 's pretty cheap . 
  i was having a hard time trying to think of a bad beer in croatia , never seen this one . 
  granted , i live abroad and spend a limited amount of time at home . 
   i rather like their logo , thougho . 
  it must be good then . 
  if a bear gets its hands ( or in this case mouth ) on you , rabies is the least of your worries . 
  ** croatia ** * a croatia airlines plane made an emergency landing in zurich after its front landing gear would not come down . 
  the pilots are being praised for their calm and composure during the ordeal in which nobody was injured . 
  the plane seems to have sustained only minor damage . 
  a personal anecdote , croatia airlines pilots have some of the softest landings i 've ever experienced , so i was n't too surprised about how well they handled this . 
  * a football match was marred by violence last night . 
  it started when the away supporters started throwing flares , rocks , and seats into the adjacent section which is a `` family-friendly '' stand in which no organized supporters/ultras sit . 
  the police then proceeded to clear the family-friendly stand with dogs and tear gas , which prompted the home supporters to try to make their way over from the opposite end . 
  they were met with another cordon of police and a fight broke out there . 
  the visiting team was later pelted with bottles and wine glasses by a wedding party that was taking place at their hotel . 
  altogether it 's a huge mess and stadium security is once again a hot topic . 
  stadia are generally quite safe in croatia and incidents are rare ( they happen moreso outside of the grounds between the ultras and are limited to some punches until the police arrive ) . 
  i 'm biased ( i 'm from the the city that hosted the match and support the home club ) , but it all started with a few morons among the visiting support who thought it 'd be fun to hurt ordinary people . 
  * the same city in which the football mess happened was flooded by a ridiculous amount of rain today . 
  in hindsight , too bad it did n't rain out the match . 
  as part of the same storm , pula ( lolromanianslol ) witnessed a few water spouts . 
  * conflicting reports have come out over the rumor that the minister of finance is being investigated by a foreign agency ( possibly italian ? ), 
  over accepting bribes . 
  [ it 's not ugly at all , the parade ended without incident . ],
