  yugoslavia had plenty of spots in more developed areas of the country to choose from to build bases with access to the mediterranean . 
  thessaloniki was a non-greek-majority city until the population exchanges with turkey in the 1920s which brought masses of greeks over from western anatolia , so there was definitely a claim at one point , far before the post-wwii macedonian identity-building project of the yugoslav communist authorities . 
  it was also the location of the founding of vmro , an anti-ottoman ( later anti-serbian and anti-greek ) slavic ( bulgarian , really ) independence movement before the city 's demographic changes . 
  and the ancient kingdom proper did feature territory that is now in fyrom . 
  maybe one day when/if i make it down there . 
  it was my grandfather 's oldest brother ( by at least a decade , maybe 15 years ) so i know the last name to look for and it is n't a local one . 
  * they also make pretty good burek * ohrid is beautiful and i 'd like to visit it * ethnic/cultural/historical ambiguity , to put it lightly * vmro was a terrorist organization that operated in macedonia during the interwar period , participated in the assassination of king alexander of yugoslavia in marseille * vardar is historically the country 's best football club and is named after the country 's largest river * albanian insurgency in the northwest ( near/around tetovo ) in the first few years of the new millennium , officially resolved but some tensions still persist * macedonian tourists get a hard time when they go to greece for vacation , if i rememember correctly i 've read that they are n't particularly hospitable to greeks either * i have distant family there ( that moved there after wwii ) whose names i do not know and have never met, 
  current macedonia is a country predominantly inhabited by slavs . 
  slavs did n't arrive in the area until several centuries ad whereas the kingdom of macedonia existed quite a few centuries bc . 
  they adopted the name of the region ( which persisted with usage going in and out of fashion ) but take it a bit far when trying to claim the history of a civilization that they could n't possibly have been a part of . 
  the kingdom was not entirely within modern greek borders . 
  the territory of the kingdom ( pre-alexander the great ) creeps into current macedonia 's and bulgaria 's territories . 
  you did n't already know this ? 
  we do n't call it poljska for nothing . 
  is n't this sort of already happening in hungary ? 
  croatia should be split between coastal and non-coastal areas . 
  i find the protests annoying , but i can see where they 're coming from . 
  there are people among the serbian minority in vukovar that participated in efforts to flatten it 20-odd years ago . 
  on the other hand , they 're hardly bilingual signs , more like just the same words ( not * always * the same , but certainly not a foreign language to a croat ) in a different script . 
  if istria was able to introduce truly bilingual signs ( with italian ) after what italy did there , they should be able to do it too . 
  175cm , which is pretty lame considering i have roots in the dinaric alps which are said to produce , on average , the tallest people in the world . 
  d'oh , there goes a third of my knowledge about latvia . 
  the capital is riga , ~ ~ alexander hleb ~ ~ , and world-renowned for its perceived lack of potatoes . 
  ** croatia ** tourist season is winding down , so a large part of the country is sort of boned ( and soon to be deserted ) until next june . 
  the government seems to have finally given in to eu demands ( and public opinion ) and will extradite a former yugoslav and croatian intelligence operative to germany to stand trial for a murder of a croat dissident in the 80s . 
  apparently the entire country watched this match and reacted just about like [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=audnsp4owpi ) to a stoppage time goal that ensured an aggregate win over a heavily favored stuttgart and a spot in the europa league group stage for a club outside of the top two ( polarizing ) clubs for the first time . 
  i know i did ... 
  because we 're doing so well and our government can afford it ( / s ) , we sent two firefighting planes over there . 
  hope they can help get that stuff under control . 
  for a while italy took the cake every weekend as far as depressing/wtf news goes , but poland 's driving figures in recent weeks have taken the lead . 
  we have a section in newspapers here , * crna kronika * , which is essentially a list of fatal accidents and other events from the day before and i thought it was terrible until i started seeing poland 's reports on here . 
  on the other hand , you 're a much larger country and we might be just about the same if our numbers are extrapolated to match your population . 
  not the worst place to make an emergency landing , 
  best reason of all . 
  please excuse my previous post , it was a bit of a perplexing concept to grasp out of context . 
  ... why ? 
  if i may ask . 
  what is probably still one of the most enduring series from the area is na\u0161e malo misto , which translates as ` our little village ' . 
  the show takes place in an unnamed dalmatian village during the late interwar period , through world war ii , and into the immediate post-war period . 
  the show chronicles the lives of several people in the village . 
  these also seem to all be on youtube , so [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlck5ouv86m ) are the first seven episodes . 
  this show was produced in serbia and takes place mostly in belgrade , but it was made in yugoslavia so ... 
  i 'm posting it anyway . 
  [ grlom u jagode ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grlom_u_jagode ) which translates directly as ' [ with ] throat into strawberries [ fields ? ] . 
  it 's a phrase that means doing something without thinking it through first . 
  the original series consisted of 10 ~ 45-minute episodes , each chronicling a year between 1960 and 1969 centering around the main character and his group of friends but with some references to historical events of the time ( often as the episodes closed ) . 
  it seems that the full episodes are all on youtube , here 's the [ first ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5cg93uw24c ) one . 
  this show also has the most nostalgic song i 've ever heard , i both love and hate it at the same time . 
  finally , another from the yugoslav period , [ top lista nadrealista ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/top_lista_nadrealista ) which translates to the surrealists ' top list . 
  this was a comedy show that consisted of skits that poked fun at a variety of topics , often including the regime of the time . 
  my favorite , which is most likely lost in translation , is the skit in which some guys in a village are trying to `` set a record '' in hrklju\u0161 , a silly made-up sport - [ link ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j71fe0g3880 ) . 
  i ca n't even begin to explain the humor in this ... 
  it sounds like baby talk . 
  if they spoke english it would be 201 . :p, 
  i do n't know much other than what has already been said , but the universe must be quite sadistic to place mount ararat in turkey and in clear view of lots of armenians . 
  also , lando calrissian is not armenian . 
  well , yours maybe , but i 've spoken to many others that seriously express that sentiment . 
  why do people always complain about living expenses ? 
  people who live in those areas are paid accordingly . 
  ** rijeka ** the self-propelled torpedo . 
  i do n't know much about him other than his title , but i apologies again if they are in order . 
  sorry for the late reply . 
  yes , three old grandmothers , though i 'm inclined to say * nonice * can also just mean old women . 
  i think you 've figured out that it comes from the italian * nona * for grandmother . 
  we also have * nono * for grandfather . 
  these are exclusive to the coast , i do n't use them though . 
  * od osme do polna * is from eight to noon , so you got the gist of that as well , i would say . 
  the entire poem is about three old women taking time out ( a lot , judging by the above line ) of their morning routine ( most likely going to the market ) to gossip about anyone and everything . 
  then , when the bells ring for noon , one has to go home and the remaining two stay and gossip about her . 
  it 's written in the local chakavian dialect . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gridayeacws&amp;feature=player_detailpage&amp;t=340 ) it is read partially in a propaganda-ish documentary from another time . 
  i think it is finished a bit later in the video . 
  ** croatia ** houses depend on what part of the country you 're in . 
  i can only really speak for the area i 'm from . 
  i 'm from rijeka which features a mish-mash of various architectural styles of the different states that have held the city . 
  the buildings that survived wwii in the center are of the type you 'd find in any larger central european city which makes sense considering they were built during austrian , hungarian , and italian administration . 
  there 's a river canyon that stretches north from the center which features terraced almost-villas on both sides - they 're small apartment buildings now . 
  [ this ] ( http://croatia.hr/images/t900x600-14606/croatia_news_rijeka_001.jpg ) picture shows a bit of all of these . 
  the post-wwii/socialist/communist period saw a lot of reconstruction and development of the city which included the building of hundreds of soviet-style apartment buildings . 
  however , given the uneven terrain , they are not arranged into blocs but are sprinkled haphazardly throughout . 
  they come in tall ( 10-15 + stories ) and short ( 5-6 stories max ) variants with the short variant often coming in long chains of connected buildings . 
  [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wvvt5.jpg ) sort of the shows how they 're tossed about . 
  there are also single-family homes sprinkled about , particularly in the outer suburbs . 
  there are also lots of unfinished houses in those areas and in suburban/non-urban areas across the country . 
  finally , some more modern buildings have been built in the last 10-15 years but they 're a very small minority . 
  smaller , touristy coastal towns feature large , often bright pastel-colored houses , featuring several small apartments that are rented out to tourists during the summer . 
  ambulanta - infirmary/first aid clinic to call an ambulance , you call * hitna pomo\u0107 * which translates to emergency services . 
  often it is shortened to * hitna * . 
  regions !, 
  what do you know about silesia ? 
  western belarus was once eastern poland , the dictatorship , bate borisov , and that 's about it . 
  ordinary citizens getting the shaft for what their government is doing , what 's new ? 
  then again , i would n't expect anything less from the mongoloids of the golden dawn . 
  bread is full of carbohydrates and , unless fortified with other ingredients , is nutritionally poor . 
  it can also be eaten for days without getting full . 
  this is n't to say i do n't eat it , but there 's certainly a guilt if i pig out on it . 
  it is n't unhealthy , per se , but it 's easy to get carried away with it which is where it creeps into unhealthiness . 
  and * everything * is available in the us , so you ca n't really say anything sucks . 
  there 's just a premium on better things most of the time , be it time or money . 
  most people tend to settle on the easier option and eat complete crap .
