  we 've all seen the passing remarks of `` turkey is not european '' when an article about turkey is posted in / r/europe and this is supposed to be a relatively left-leaning website . 
  whether or not turkey would merit entry based on its efforts to adhere to regulations for accession would be entirely trivial to those people . 
  i hope not . 
  ugh , jagoda means strawberry in croatian . 
  just when i thought i was starting to figure some things out ... 
  it 's a bit hard to find something distinctly * ours * since we 've borrowed so many foods from our previous overlords , but here we go . 
  [ fritule ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritule ) originating in the coastal areas , they 're now pretty common throughout croatia . 
  traditionally they 're made during easter and christmas time but i 'll take them whenever !, 
  the best is made using [ these spiky little bastards ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scorpaena_scrofa ) . 
  i remember picking them out of nets a few times and pricking myself ( they apparently have a bit of venom in them too ) but they were worth it when caught in sufficient quantity to prepare the stew . 
  i can into relevance !, 
  also , * milja * = 1000 . 
  i 'm not really following you . 
  what i was getting at was that given how homophobia has been even trendier than usual over the last month or so , i would have expected a large showing from that bloc at today 's event . 
  pretty much . 
  the amendment would n't change the enforcement of any laws , it would just do exactly what you said there - make it harder for marriage equality in the future . 
  ironic considering the recent petition to define marriage in the constitution . 
  let 's put it this way , there 's more of a commotion caused by an anti- * < insert liberal change here  * rally or by hajduk split getting an unfavorable match result than by anything that actually affects people 's lives . 
  this match took place in a city with a muslim majority in the `` federal '' part of the country , not in republika srpska . 
  also , bosniak ( bo\u0161njak ) refers specifically to bosnian muslims . 
  serbs in bosnia are referred to as bosnian serbs . 
  finally , while i 'm not sure to what degree bosnian serbs support the bosnian national team , they absolutely will not support it when it 's playing against serbia . 
  i do n't know how to cross-post , so i just put it here the old-fashioned way . 
  i also put it over in / r/soccer . 
  uh ... we have dumpsters . 
  it 'll be a few of the rolling ones in a row and will draw from maybe 10-20 buildings of various sizes . 
  large apartment buildings will often have their own set . 
  pretty much all of the leaders of the independence movements that led to the dissolution of yugoslavia are considered disgraceful figures by their countries ' mainstreams . 
  because a russian is reading it . 
  it 's just a really long list of amino acids . 
  we already have a very good and painstakingly built set of highways . 
  unfortunately , the next project on the ledger is a bridge that 'll remove the need to pass through bosnia-herzegovina to reach the southern-most parts of the country . 
  i say unfortunately because that will serve far fewer mo/to ( u ) rists than some planned projects up north . 
  granted , it does become more important with croatia joining the eu and avoiding a border security mess with all of that , but less expensive alternatives have been suggested only to be scoffed at . 
  we 'll just take your disposable income then . 
  come in , the water 's great !, 
  i think the greeks did it first . 
  i live in the states , homemade is the only bread we have at home . 
  i 'm going to have to find recipes for some of the delicious looking things i 've seen here though . 
  i 'm full as i 'm looking through them and it 's making me want some . 
  romania can not into balkans . 
  turkish footballer . 
  quite good in his own right . 
  it 's a similar last name so the confusion is understandable . 
  i was going to mention that border as well as czech/slovak and perhaps portuguese/spanish ( i 'm not particularly well informed on that matter , but i know native portuguese speakers pick up spanish very easily ) . 
  i concede all of those points ( thanks for the lesson !, 
  ) , but i do n't think mutual intelligibility or a gradient/continuum of change is a reason to discount setting a delineation between languages . 
  if that were the case , half of the language borders on the map should n't exist . 
  it may not be the best drawn map , but it could at least be consistent then . 
  i suppose that 's true , but only to a certain extent . 
  i would say that is definitely the case along the part of the border formed by the kupa and in zagorje . 
  i do n't really see that being the case along slovene-chakavian borders though . 
  i 'm not bothered by that grouping . 
  i 'm more bothered by being grouped with you germanophile pseudo-slav alpmonkeys :p and with bulgarian , which is clearly a separate language . 
  maybe i 'm just partly colorblind , but i honestly see no distinction between any of the south slav languages whereas western and eastern slav languages are separately color-coded . 
  edit : after a second look , i see a slight difference between serbo-croatian and bulgarian , but only because of the area around ni\u0161 . 
  i suppose it 's possible that the dinstinction between slovene and serbo-croatian is not visible because it follows our common border perfectly . 
  italy : padova , venice slovenia : [ postojna cave ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/postojna_cave ) croatia : you 'll probably drive north and east of istria , but it is not too far of a deviation if you want to check out one of the many attractive towns it features ( pula , pore\u010d , rovinj , motovun , gro\u017enjan among others ) . 
  you 'll drive directly by opatija and rijeka , both of which you can `` check out '' quickly enough . 
  also , are you [ taking a ferry ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=prizna,+croatia+to+%c5%bdigljen,+croatia&amp;saddr=prizna,+croatia&amp;daddr=%c5%bdigljen,+croatia&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;ll=44.587411,14.961834&amp;spn=0.074453,0.154324&amp;sll=44.588389,14.977627&amp;sspn=0.074451,0.154324&amp;geocode=fcvrqaid9nlkacl5beh-9cpjrzego5xpcefk0w%3bfydupwidedtjacnlmtmtokpirzgcblw1z5kmvq&amp;oq=prizna,+croatia+to+zgiljen&amp;t=h&amp;z=13 ) or [ driving down to the bridge ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=pa%c5%a1ki+most,+mi%c5%a1kovci,+croatia&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf8&amp;sll=44.325553,15.257155&amp;sspn=0.009348,0.01929&amp;oq=paski+most&amp;t=h&amp;doflg=ptk&amp;hnear=pa%c5%a1ki+most,+23249,+mi%c5%a1kovci,+zadarska+%c5%beupanija,+croatia&amp;z=16 ) ? 
  if it 's the latter , zadar and nin ( give preference to zadar ) are n't too far out of your way . 
  in any case , you 'll also pass crikvenica , novi vinodolski , and senj on your way down . 
  these are all pretty popular summer destinations . 
  senj also has a bit of history to it . 
  oh god , someone else thought of him ( balaban ) too ? 
  after a quick check , i was n't aware he played in brugge . 
  for four years , no less . 
  [ told you ! ], 
  ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1e6b9e/most_scenic_train_ride/c9x8guh?context=3 ) i would love to have seen the reactions of people as they saw the train pass by . 
  croatia the national airline , croatia airlines , laid off 40 or so flight attendants for all taking the day off sick on the same day . 
  it was clearly some form of protest because the average is apparently six per day . 
  i do n't know much more about it than that , but it set off quite a bit of drama . 
  i * may * have read that they were re-instated by a court but i 'm not sure . 
  also , the victims of jasenovac , the wwii concentration camp run by the usta\u0161a regime in which a large * number of serbs were brutally killed , were commemorated in zagreb . 
  ( * ) - the figure is disputed and i have no desire to piss off either side here . 
  the mayor of split , the second largest city , and resident political clown thought it would be a good idea to arrive to the mayoral debate by yacht in the company of a band allegedly playing usta\u0161a songs . 
  he also spawned [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/fmndd5k.jpg ) semi-viral gem this week . 
  which brings me to the final newsworthy note and that is that local elections are next week . 
  these are elections for city and county/prefecture officials . 
  if the opposition make any headway , they 're guaranteed to call for early elections at the national level ( which they already sort of did after winning more seats in the european parliament in an election that 80 % or so of the country did n't vote in ) . 
  they 'll probably call for them even if they do n't make any headway . 
  not a first-hand account , but i 've heard good things about [ belgrade - bar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belgrade_-_bar_railway ) . 
  probably a bit out of your way though . 
  this subreddit and / r/mapporn have made me realize that i 'm most excited about joining the eu because we 'll finally be included on these maps . 
  croatia is intermittently planning on [ bridging ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peljesac_bridge ) an entire country 's coastline . 
  [ pretty sure it went to hell a few years earlier . ], 
  at least this is a territorial dispute . 
  they 're fighting over a * name * a few hundred kilometers to the south . 
  are you sure you 're interpreting that correctly ? 
  if there is a minimum seat requirement for a party , it should n't be a baseline but rather just a threshold . 
  meaning , if the serb vote wins eleven seats , they would receive eleven seats and would surpass the minimum of ten seats , not give them eleven seats on top of ten seats they are guaranteed by the constitution . 
  ( i 'm asking , not correcting . 
  you are clearly more informed . ), 
  i was going to chime in on this but did n't want to get downvoted into oblivion . 
  while it is quite a taboo to be nostalgic about communism , many really were better off during communism . 
  while the economic system was terribly planned and the state subsidized many sectors of it , people had jobs and put food on the table . 
  the city i 'm from had a port that had dozens of ships anchored in the bay waiting for their turn to dock whereas now we 're selling out to the chinese so they can modernize our infrastructure and use it to import their goods to europe because traffic is abysmal . 
  a lot of industry also crumbled as the previous system did . 
  i , along with many others , believe this to be down to malicious mismanagement in the kleptocracy that arose with independence . 
  there were downsides , of course , but it was n't as bad as what the nations that are covered in the survey went through .
