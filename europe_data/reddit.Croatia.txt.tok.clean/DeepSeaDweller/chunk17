  i 'm from rijeka , there 's still a small hungarian community but i ca n't really say i hear much about them other than the odd cultural event . 
  as far as tourists go , there are a bunch but i never hear much about them either other than numbers . 
  i did once see a massive pick-up truck ( i live in the us and it was bigger than what i usually see here ) with hungarian plates parked across three spots though so you 're all obviously inconsiderate americans in disguise . 
  to keep it short , backlash against the communist regime . 
  i 've heard good things about veljkovic too . 
  and liberland . 
  send them all there to see just how free it really is . 
  jebati means to fuck but swearing is so commonplace that people are desensitized to it and it 's not that inflammatory . 
  also , the `` severity '' of its derivatives depends on the prefix/meaning and context . 
  zajebati means to mess up ( zajeban means something/someone is in some way messed up ) or someone screwed someone else over and is n't that bad , odjebi means fuck off and is a bit more serious . 
  they were supposed to play dinamo in zagreb . 
  the security at the match refused to allow a fairly large number of hajduk supporters citing that they were on a list of people barred from entering . 
  the thing is that there was no such public ( / official police ) list but rather some sort of internal list of the home club ( who have had a terrible record with their own supporters in recent years , banning or detaining people for insulting club leadership ) . 
  at any rate , hajduk refused to play because not all of their supporters were allowed in , then went back to split and were received as if they had just won the league . 
  aside from where they already do ... trakoscan castle , nehaj fortress , pula , maybe motovun or even trsat . 
  an englishman in a croatian city for the interested . 
  also the site of the first high-speed photo . 
  he posts the same kind of drivel in this sub . 
  eh , i was just getting at the fact that children 's brains have far more plasticity than even young adults . 
  this does n't have as much to do with immediate recovery , but the fact that he 's still young means his brain could recover more in the long-run if any damage was done . 
  you need to separate fact from attitude . 
  nobody likes a person who has to come in and rain on what looks like an act towards reconciliation . 
  complaining about downvotes never helps either . 
  do n't all jewish males undergo circumcision ? 
   most people like her she won in an extremely tight election and given the political polarization in our country it 's difficult to win over those that did n't vote for you . 
  many like her but i would n't say most . 
  this is a stupid sentiment . 
  we can also all be painted with the same brush based on what has been done under this flag or one of its historical predecessors . 
  [ yes .

  kvarner is generally overlooked in favor of istria and dalmatia . 
  not that nobody goes there but there are fewer tourists . 
  maybe not in the 60s but those things arrived long before the end of communism . 
  it 's not entirely accurate but it 's not a sentiment to be dismissed . 
  low-hanging fruit and all that . 
  you only really need [ one guy ] ( http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/its-always-sunny-charlie-kelly-king-of-rats.jpg ) . 
  huh , til . 
  was n't montenegro ( ironically/surprisingly considering stereotypes ) also ahead of its time on women 's rights ? 
  i want to say that women 's voting/education/some other good thing happened in montenegro before anywhere else in europe . 
  i 'm not sure if i 've ever had sarajevsko . 
  * maybe * once , which is n't really enough to judge . 
  never tried them . 
  also , pilsner urquell ( czech ) . 
  it 's unfortunately among the most consumed beers in the world . 
  it 's cheap * and * it 's popular in a very populous country where beer-drinking is very common . 
  most beers ca n't say that . 
  is this current ? 
  i thought most had been cleared . 
  then again , this is a significantly better picture than others i have seen in which the former front lines were thick red bands . 
  leffe , chimay ( both belgian ) , budvar ( czech ) , paulaner ( german ) , nik\u0161i\u0107ko ( montenegrin ) , and la\u0161ko ( slovene ) as a quick rundown . 
  opinions on the death penalty aside , there are definitely more humane ways of imposing death on someone . 
  the death sentence is an unfortunate business but there 's no need for exaggeration . 
  imagine the most resilient dingleberry you 've ever had times 100 . 
  also the cradle of serbian culture . 
  slavonia has fantastic food but he is n't wrong in saying it is n't touristy . 
  in croatia children can not enroll in school/daycare if they are not vaccinated so it 's not exactly the state mandating vaccination but you pretty much need to do it anyway . 
  at least it is n't belosvetski jew gold . 
  of course it 's the balkans with the best removal . 
  bahaha , most wo n't understand this but this is brilliant . 
  eh , they sound bad but people went through those motions with a smirk on their face . 
  everyone knew how corny it was . 
  with several ongoing stories ( nsa , isis , russia and ukraine , ttip ) hogging this sub over the last months/year , anything different is a welcome addition imo . 
  i guess that 's true , it 's just odd to see it in use like that . 
  that 's an anachronism , nobody uses the term croatia to refer to a specific region within the country . 
  not to mention that it captures areas with significantly different stereotypes . 
  looking west across the sava , i believe . 
  the far bank looks like new belgrade . 
  what 's croatia within croatia ? 
  [ not quite ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_regency_of_carnaro ) . 
  do n't downvote him , it 's true . 
  the term used is * vlaj * . 
  it 's a term for people not from the coast but not necessarily as harsh as / u/kradem 's post makes it sound . 
  and that 's probably the entire report . 
  well , there 's probably also a back cover too . 
  :( i thought you had posted [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv_lxnyx0jq ) . 
  have n't you heard ? 
  they just opened a safe haven , liberland , right next door !, 
  it 's a molecular time bomb with a timer that is reset by applying gratuitous amounts of holy water to the forehead and obscene amounts of rakija to the bloodstream . 
  serbian chetniks collaborated with axis forces during wwii to fight against the partisans . 
  they even fought side-by-side with ustase forces in some operations and fled toward the northwest in columns together as the war was ending . 
  at its core , chetnik ideology is nationally or ethnically exclusive , something that is commonly equated with fascism . 
  edit : if people are going to downvote me , could they also provide a response to and reason for disagreement with my post ? 
  basically poland . 
  it 's also completely flat . 
  because i was curious , her parents were american and hungarian . 
  extremely poor oral hygene . 
  as if there 's a difference between a loan and a donation to a political party . 
  they both buy sway . 
  i ca n't say i expected anything better than that from you . 
  agnostics are as different from atheists as they are from `` believers . '', 
  josipovic identified as agnostic .

  because it 's a construct that has only existed for the last 20 years . 
  bosnia-herzegovina has been used to refer to the administrative unit covering the present day country since the late 19th/early 20th century . 
  yeah but zlatan ibrahimovic is rightfully bosnian clay . 
  it 's also easy to learn since all of the characters match up one-to-one . 
  still have to learn additional characters for bulgarian , ukrainian , russian , etc. 
  though .
