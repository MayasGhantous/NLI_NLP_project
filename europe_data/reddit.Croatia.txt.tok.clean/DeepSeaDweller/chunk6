  he was a leading military official in an offensive in which buildings were damaged and destroyed , yes . 
  this is what tends to happen during war . 
  however , he was acquitted of ordering his troops to commit war crimes ( which did happen , do n't think i 'm denying that ) . 
  i do n't see why this warrants a mention of his name , legal dealings , and honorary citizenship in a completely unrelated city . 
  the video could definitely use some more gypsies . 
  it 's a bit sad that they 're such a rarity nowadays . 
  there was also the peglica ( which / u/ajuc linked to as the maluch , which is probably the actual model name - who knew ) . 
  the yugo went through a bit of a rough patch in croatia in the 90 's . 
  with the war and the tensions that came with it , the fact that it was called yugo and was produced in serbia made it unpopular enough with some that they gave them up/vandalized them . 
  edit : re-hosted because photobucket . 
  some do , most do n't . 
  i 'm sure it 's a similar split to every other ex-yu country . 
  it 's also a regional thing , depending on who benefited and who suffered from partisan activity and the subsequent government . 
  rijeka and istria were liberated and re-incorporated by the partisans and did quite well for themselves under communist rule and it 's evident with still-active tito `` fan clubs '' and the like . 
  herzegovina and the dalmatian hinterland , a hotbed of usta\u0161a sentiment and areas that were purposely ignored and underdeveloped during the communist period - not so much . 
  the only exclusively croatian dessert i can think of is [ fritule ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fritule ) . 
  also , apparently we have the best ice cream in the world . 
   with another large bottle of union rookie mistake , should 've gone with la\u0161ko . 
  you actually claim those germanic mountain slavs ? 
  but they 're so ... * organized * . 
  ancestry is a big deal in the us . 
  it 's annoying , but people will say they 're three or four different ethnicities/nationalities simply based on where their ( great ) grandparents came from . 
  albania was never a part of yugoslavia . 
  poor guy won the wrong type of lottery . 
  it has been suggested that minority voters showed solidarity with the sexual minority/ies against the increasingly organized far right in croatia ( this initiative , the politicized war veterans in vukovar ) . 
  let 's not fool ourselves though , serbia proper is n't any more tolerant or `` safe '' for homosexuals than croatia . 
  in fact , i 'd say it 's probably worse . 
  they were only able to hold an impromptu gay pride parade because the scheduled event was banned due to safety concerns . 
  not to mention the last few years where there were more police guarding the parade ( and fighting off protesters ) than participants in the parades . 
  from what i have read and heard , serbs visit the northern coastal areas in far greater numbers than the southern/dalmatian coast . 
  being from rijeka , i 've been seeing increasing numbers of serbian license plates every year i 've visited . 
  your sentiment definitely is n't an uncommon one . 
  i ca n't comment on uncomfortable experiences though . 
  i 'm sorry you and/or your acquaintances have had to deal with them . 
  an unstoppable force meets an immovable object . 
  yes . 
  perhaps i should have specified . 
  my mistake .

  sorry , i did n't mean to nitpick . 
  :p thanks for the insight into their survival though . 
  i was never particularly interested in extremophile bacteria ( since they were always accompanied with a note that they live in very isolated environments like thermal vents , the bottom of the ocean , etc. ), 
  but it 's really cool to learn something about a mammal that comes close to that classification for at least part of the year . 
   kidneys work careful not to lose any precious nutrients with the urine making reindeer urine extra pure . 
  this is n't how kidneys work . 
  their function is to maintain concentrations of various substances in the blood ( and by extension , other body fluids ) , not prevent the loss of nutrients . 
  in some cases , it is necessary to expel nutrients if they 're too plentiful . 
  additionally , pure is n't really an appropriate adjective to describe urine . 
  it is either concentrated or diluted . 
  it 's depressing to read about/see the depopulation of croatian islands . 
  the old way of life there is dying out and the younger generations have flocked to the cities . 
  in the same vein , maritime traditions in general . 
  old hand-made ( / built ? ), 
  wooden boats being replaced by fiberglass speedboats , fewer and fewer of those ` old man and the sea ' types , old coastal towns sacrificing everything for tourism ( eyesore architecture , lots of noise ) . 
  it could be much * much * worse . 
  in my limited conversation with poles , i seem to get the sense that it 's pretty bad there . 
  and this may be true to an extent . 
  but you 've got it made compared to a lot of other countries . 
  * vodi\u010d u autobusu : ulazimo u sloveniju , sa desne strane mo\u017eete vidjeti ... jebiga , ulazimo u austriju ... * tourist guide in a bus : we are now entering slovenia , on your right you can see ... ah screw it , we are now entering austria . 
  if so , he should really invest in a vehicle with plexiglass windows while driving through serbia then . 
  [ postojna cave ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/postojna_cave ) [ bled ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bled ) [ piran ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piran ) looked nice from croatia , would check it out if given the chance .

  contrary to popular belief , serbs do n't melt when they get wet . 
  that 's a bit misleading considering what it 's being compared to ... 
  the gypsies live in much nicer houses , for one .

  south africa wins rugby tournaments to solve its problems . 
  sweden ... orders solutions from ikea ? 
  we have a bunch of words with no traditional vowels - r is technically considered a vowel in those cases . 
  of course it 's a valuable language to know , the problem is that the fact that the dutch speak it so well makes learning dutch that much less of a necessity , especially if they just change to english if they notice you 're having some difficulty in dutch . 
  maybe the dutch should learn english less .

  i 'm from there but i live in the states but i try to visit as often as i can . 
  it 's a nice city and i love it very dearly , but i have a hard time imagining why someone would move there from somewhere with so much more opportunity . 
  i 'm interested to know how you find living there and what you like to do there . 
  unfortunately , some are still stuck in 1941/1945 . 
  the government made it significantly easier to initiate and pass a referendum in order for the referendum on entering the eu to pass . 
  the right wing is now taking advantage of this but the government plans on closing loophole back up . 
  my hometown 's tree was so pitiful , a group of citizens ( a lot of them football supporters - they seemed to raise the initiative ) gathered their own decorations and went to decorate it themselves , only to be stopped by the police . 
  after a lot of public backlash , they were allowed to return the next day to finish decorating it . 
  to be fair , there is quite a difference between crimea and kaliningrad .
