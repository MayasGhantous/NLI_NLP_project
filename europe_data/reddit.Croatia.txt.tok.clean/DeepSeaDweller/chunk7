  so is murter , i believe . 
  maybe both . 
  it 's one between zadar and sibenik for sure or it might just be two islands connected by a bridge . 
  and to be pedantic , you can also access sveti marko on the krk bridge . 
  here 's some prosciutto to wipe away your tears with . 
  go to the [ krka national park ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krka_national_park ) , you can swim under the waterfalls in the first picture . 
  you 'll have plenty of company though . 
  and yes , the ban on swimming at plitvice is for conservation purposes . 
  the pools are formed by sediment ( i think ? ), 
  deposits by the water as it flows . 
  the deposits build over time forming little dams over which the water flows . 
  the ban is to protect the physical features from damage and to prevent any alterations to the chemical environment that has created and maintains the features . 
  rijeka traditionally is n't a big tourist destination . 
  for a long time , a lot was sacrificed ( nature , primarily ) for the advancement of local industry . 
  however , with most of the industry going into bankruptcy and falling into disrepair , the region has switched gears to tourism . 
  it 's nice to see / u/matt4077 call it authentic and i would agree . 
  a lot of the touristy areas `` suffer '' from trying very hard to please and cater to tourists . 
  lots of flashy ( imo gaudy ) buildings , people standing outside of their shops trying to get you to come in , lots of inaccessible and expensive content . 
  additionally , there are quite a few very nice more traditional tourist areas that are fairly easily accessed from rijeka . 
  opatija , the monte carlo of the austro-hungarian empire , is a few miles away . 
  any point in istria is within an hour 's drive . 
  postojna , slovenia , is about an hour and 15 minutes away . 
  quite a few northern adriatic islands are accessed via ferry/speedboat from the port . 
  gorski kotar ( the mountainous hinterland to the north-east ) is attempting to develop a tourist industry . 
  it 's a very sparsely developed area so the nature is incredible . 
  overall , rijeka itself is a nice city which offers some content ( probably not as much as a city of its size should ) and is centrally located as a transport hub close to a number of tourist destinations and areas . 
  / end plug, 
  well crap . 
  although barry white was anything but white . 
  you are no slav . 
  tuhobic - the one separating kvarner from gorski kotar . 
  although i like gorski kotar ... 
  built by germans . 
  transdniester/transinistria does not touch the danube . 
  well , the communism that eastern europe saw never really gave freedom a chance either . 
  we can all dream of the worker 's paradise marx described but that 's not what it came out as in the application of his ideas . 
  rosbif-free !, 
  want to invest in ~ ~ eastern poland ~ ~ croatia ? 
  do n't !, 
   first time i hear about pea beer . 
  not sure why he wants to go to the baltics to try it since there are plenty availabe in the us . 
  well , san stefano and triannon are still relatively fresh for bulgaria and hungary , respectively . 
  ... who 's driving ? 
  knew what it would be before clicking . 
  excellent film and one of the few ( in my experience ) with a proper english translation available . 
  highly recommended for a foreigner who wants to get an idea of what the war ( it takes place in bosnia , but it gives a good overview in general ) was like . 
  [ no man 's land ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/no_man's_land_ ( 2001_film ), 
  east adriatic is best adriatic !, 
  most beaches in croatia are `` free '' but you have to know what to expect . 
  we have very few , if any , sandy beaches . 
  the only time i 've stepped on sand at a beach in croatia was one where you enter the water on steps and the sea floor is sand . 
  what we do have is [ small rock beaches ] ( http://www.likecroatia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/plaze_brelaivoravliccropix.jpg ) ( some smaller , some a bit larger ) , [ rocky beaches ] ( http://lijepa-nasa.hr/prijava_pm/user_upload/2013/opcinakostrena/plaze/svezanj/foto_plaze.jpg ) with a few entrances ( either natural or man-made , a lot will also have man-made flat parts ) , or a [ combination ] ( http://www.croatiatravelinfo.com/wp-content/uploads//2012/12/91259b82642854f67a3f84519f96bb13.jpg ) of the two . 
  we 've already been through that series . 
  if someone has no knowledge of or does not like anything about the country in question , they do n't have to respond . 
  this is [ sveti stefan ] ( https://maps.google.com/maps?q=sveti+stefan,+montenegro&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.263463,18.885155&amp;spn=0.082703,0.154324&amp;sll=42.28277,18.844213&amp;sspn=0.041339,0.077162&amp;oq=sv&amp;t=h&amp;hnear=sveti+stefan,+montenegro&amp;z=13 ) , a bit south of budva . 
  and ugh , i cringe every time i see a beach with those chairs . 
  you have to pay to use them and they just get in the way of normal beach goers . 
  sometimes they pile them so densely there 's no room left for anyone else , [ like so ] ( http://medvejaonline.com/medveja_1bjpg.jpg ) . 
  they 're taller than you . 
  be jealous . 
  no , the latter just sounds odd . 
  nobody refers to slavs as slavians , why should yugoslavs be yugoslavians ? 
  granted , it 's already yugoslavia so putting an n at the end is less egregious than saying slavian . 
  not looking at the message of it , this article is terribly written . 
  it 's just full of buzz words in barely coherent sentences which have to be read several times to draw any meaning from them . 
  it 's incredibly frustrating to see articles like this written so poorly and by people whose area of expertise clearly lies elsewhere . 
  ^ ^ ^ it 's ^ ^ ^ also ^ ^ ^ yugoslav , ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ yugoslavian . 
  surprising , considering russia 's the one with the homosexual nazi group . 
  likely some hard drugs involved there too . 
  i like this one , though i can see them receiving a more limited response than the country series . 
   just so people do n't get the wrong idea of poland as a whole , there 's never been any anti-homosexual law in poland poland 's constitution defines marriage as being between a man and a woman . 
  unfortunately , croatia may possibly go the same way soon . 
  having said that , i do n't think that is grounds to brand an entire country as vicious homophobic hooligans , but it does establish some level of anti-homosexuality . 
  pro-tip : do n't buy bottled flat water , the local tap water is generally excellent . 
  jews are n't a particularly common target for the far right in croatia as they have never been a noticeable presence . 
  there were only 20,000 in croatia on the eve of wwii . 
  there is limited animosity due to various conspiracy theories about zionism and disagreement over israel 's foreign policy , but i would n't class that under antisemitism in the traditional sense of the word . 
  thanks for generalizing . 
  not sure if serious or not . 
  in any case , [ austro-prussian war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austro-prussian_war ) . 
  what about prussia vs. austria ? 
  that was pretty serious stuff . 
  got ta fight for every square inch of our clay . 
  ban potato ~ ~ seizures ~ ~ collectivization ? 
  brilliant move , latvia !, 
  why does it say peanuts at the beginning ? 
  ^ ^ ^ kikiriki ^ ^ ^ is ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ word ^ ^ ^ for ^ ^ ^ peanuts ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ bdsmfjhsjhd/yugo ^ ^ ^ language . 
  [ because . ], 
  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb-jzsyhwsc ), 
  ** croatia ** the behemoth antonov airplane came to zagreb to pick up a giant electrical transformer . 
  seeing the lines of people that came to see it , you 'd think the pope was coming . 
  oh , and we 're going to have a referendum on whether or not the constitution should define marriage as being between a man and a woman . 
  because there is currently no greater threat to croats and their livelihoods than homosexuals and their love . 
  edit : added country . 
   plus stronk most timezones clay, 
  i do n't know about that , i 'd place england above them . 
  french rap is fun to listen to though . 
  they 're both baby talk anyway . 
  well , there should have been one when serbia and montenegro separated but the latter could n't be bothered . 
  whoa now , guys , we 're not due for another war for a while .
