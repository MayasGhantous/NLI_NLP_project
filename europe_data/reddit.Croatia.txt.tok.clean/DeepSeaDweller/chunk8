  i think albania has suffered more from the legacy of its communist past than from its neighbors . 
  while serbia and macedonia have had armed conflicts with ethnic albanians , they have been with kosovar albanians , not albanians from albania proper ( there 's a difference ) . 
  they have n't had any glaring issues with the state of albania . 
  could you elaborate on the bit on albania ? 
  nice , did n't know that . 
  just went to see for myself and ...

  [ and an exclave ! ], 
  lots of people know all kinds of things about italy , so i 'll go more into croatia 's relationship with italy . 
  * they 've never beaten us in football since independence :p * italy has , through various periods and to various extents , held large parts of the eastern adriatic . 
  venice held a lot of it for a long time , italy proper held the far north ( istria , rijeka , and a few islands ) during the interwar period and occupied the rest during wwii . 
  a personal anecdote on this , my grandmother completed her secondary education in an italian school in occupied dalmatia . 
  * rijeka has several italian primary schools and one secondary school . 
  instruction , with presumably the exception of croatian language class , is exclusively in italian . 
  * all of istria has bilingual signs . 
  * the coast uses quite an extensive list of italian loanwords . 
  some are modified , some are just about the same . 
  * rijeka ( fiume at the time/in italian ) experienced fascism ( or perhaps proto-fascism ) at the hand of gabrielle d'annunzio before the rest of italy got mussolini . 
  [ wiki article ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/italian_regency_of_carnaro ) * while not particularly great , italian occupation was far less perilous than german occupation during wwii . 
  when italy surrendered in 1943 , the germans scrambled to fill the power vacuum in the east adriatic areas and established a far harsher regime . 
  deportations of suspected anti-fascists grew exponentially , counter-insurgency and reprisals on civilian populations became a reality , and industrial centers fell prey to indiscriminate allied bombings . 
  * there used to be a decent italian population , mostly in the cities . 
  now , not so much . 
  * we have similar foods along the coast . 
  not sure how much of this is italian influence and how much is just a mediterranean thing . 
  i think many do , but i think i 've seen other countries that do n't have this . 
  i have n't really handled too many foreign bills so it 's likely that i 'm wrong . 
  if it is really that common , my mistake . 
   smart , thoughtful , reasoned comments would be more appreciated , though . 
  quite . 
  we have animals and plants on coins in croatia . 
  animals on kuna ( the equivalent of euros , dollars , pounds , etc. ), 
  and plants on lipa ( the equivalent of cents ) . 
  it 's silly and not very prestigious ( relative to the coins of other countries ) , but i like them . 
  we also have bills of different colors . 
  [ bills ] ( http://blogs.r.ftdata.co.uk/beyond-brics/files/2012/08/136070175.jpg ) , [ coins ] ( http://0.tqn.com/d/coins/1/0/0/3/-/-/croatia_money_coins.jpg ), 
  i like to wait for the crust and then just pick it off and eat it like chips . 
  in the states , can confirm this feeling . 
  and a plain yogurt to go with it . 
  polenta with milk and/or sour cream in my neck of the woods . 
   something that did n't include forcing people into a state that failed little over half a dozen years earlier ? 
  such as ? 
  who would have led any other push ? 
  whose support would they have had ? 
  the partisans were overwhelmingly the largest force in the area and they facilitated the creation of the federation . 
  individual nationalist causes had no legitimacy having just pursued policies of genocide , ethnic cleansing , and xenophobia against ethnic minorities ( serbs , croats , albanians , and bosnian muslims were guilty of some or all of these ) . 
  additionally , i would n't say it was the same state . 
  efforts were taken to decentralize power relative to the kingdom , something that non-serb politicians and parties fought for during the interwar period . 
   and you think it was different in other parts of eastern europe ? 
  have you ever bothered checking what the literacy rates were in poland ? 
  at the end of austria-hungary , literacy rates in poland were below 10 % , whereas on the territory of slovenia and croatia they were 30-40 % . 
  should poles look with nostalgia at the soviet dominated communist era because it raised their literacy levels to western standards ? 
   do you think baltics had it better outside of cities ? 
  native populations had attrocious levels of literacy and no industry . 
  they should also be thankful for what sssr did to them !, 
   yet despite all that `` culture '' that krakow had , krakow 's county had a literacy rate lower than that of zagreb whereas the other nearby counties had a literacy level more than three times lower than the average for croatia . 
  and that 's in the `` progressive '' slesian part of the country . 
  i did n't know these figures , but i do n't think they 're particularly relevant . 
  maybe i was wrong about how far behind we were , but it does n't mean that tito 's yugoslavia and the eastern bloc did not educate the masses . 
  something that capitalists , fascists , democrats , what-have-you did not accomplish . 
  education is one of the positive legacies of the period , nobody denies this . 
  i will address this though ,  they were centers of culture , attracting central european foreigners ( germans , jews , hungarians ) in the same way ljubljana , zagreb , osijek , rijeka , etc. 
  attracted . 
  they were centers of culture as well as education ( i failed to mention this in my last post ) and attracted people from all over europe . 
  those cities you mentioned attracted people from their immediate rural areas , such as slavonia , zagorje , bosnia , gorski kotar , lika , herzegovina , dalmatia , etc. 
  they are incomparable . 
  i would n't say i have a misguided view of history , just clearly more inclined to give credit where credit is due rather than viewing the world as black and white . 
  i 'm responding to this because i feel this may be somewhat directed at me and those that have provided certain defenses of the period . 
  not too many people want a return of yugoslavia ( myself included ) , but they do recognize that there are elements of the period that can be appreciated and that it should n't be completely vilified as propaganda of the 90 's suggested . 
   well , he murderded thousands , and oppressed millions . 
  that he was better a murdered less than his contemporaries , does not make him a good guy . 
  well , many of the killings took place in the form of summary executions of axis soldiers and collaborators and were carried in the immediate aftermath of their capture . 
  they were done with the intent of payback for the crimes they committed as well as to prevent them from remaining active in the postwar period and posing a threat to the new state . 
  the usta\u0161e leadership of the war-time fascist puppet independent state of croatia started out as an underground organization that carried out terrorist attacks ( most notably the [ assassination of king alexander in marseille ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexander_i_of_yugoslavia#assassination ) during the interwar period and it 's not a stretch to believe they would have resumed such activities . 
  unfortunately , many innocents were caught in this dragnet and perished . 
  detentions began in 1948 when yugoslavia split from the soviet-dominated eastern bloc and were carried out against anybody that demonstrated signs of sympathizing with the soviet union . 
   also , that he only murded in the beginning ( mostly ) is because afterwards there were not that many more , and he had already shown what would happen . 
  the killings took place predominantly during the lawlessness of the end of wwii . 
   so , really , it does not make him a good guy , or an honorable guy . 
  he did not allow to much opposition , not at all . 
  no , but given what we know now , who came out of wwii in a good and honorable light ? 
  the soviets raped and pillaged eastern europe , the western allies bombed parts of germany and japan into the stone age . 
   of the eastern countries ddr had it best . 
  one do no see them honoring honecker , who had far , far less killed than tito . 
  do n't you think it would be weird giving mrs honecker a state funeral , generally reserved for adenauer and people like him ? 
  the ddr had the most pervasive secret police force the world has ever seen . 
  there were absolutely no freedoms , no freedom of movement , and their access to consumer goods was severely restricted and limited . 
  the ddr went from flying high during the later interwar period and first half of the war to being destroyed and dominated by the soviets in the following decades . 
   b ) besides , if i understand the economic side of it he took a lot of loans yugoslavia in no way could afford and thus laid the groundwork for later economic problems later on . 
  had he lived he would have had to face them too . 
  why would anyone honour that ? 
  yes , yugoslavia 's economy was heavily dependent on foreign loans and had difficulties in repaying them . 
  i believe they took loans to pay loans . 
  at any rate , yugoslavia was in a position in which they could get loans based on their geopolitical position in the cold war . 
  also , like i said , the average citizen did n't really feel the strain of this too often . 
  people had jobs and could put food on the table and splurge on luxuries every so often . 
   ok , i 'll stop calling him that , thanks . 
  but what did he call himself ? 
  i believe it was worker 's self-management ( * radni\u010dko samoupravljanje * ) . 
   he oppressed anyone who wanted an independent croatia etc ( and did n't he punish them for ustasja or however it is spelled ) the only case where an area was punished was , i believe , western herzegovina and the dalmatian hinterland . 
  these areas were largely ignored during development and to this day remain relatively underdeveloped .
