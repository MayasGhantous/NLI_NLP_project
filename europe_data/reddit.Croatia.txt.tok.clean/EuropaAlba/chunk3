  i just want to see the stridsvagn 103 compete in one of the biathlons . 
  my point was just the last thing . 
  in english , asian denotes racial membership instead of geographical membership . 
  for example , if i see a bunch of asian tourists doing something strange , since i do n't know if they 're chinese , japanese , korean , etc. 
  i 'd point them out not as asian but as yellow . 
  although i 'm curious now , how many races would you say exist , how do you divide and classify races ? 
  like continents racial classification depends on culture . 
  yes the races are white , black and yellow . 
  you would say that a chinese person or a vietnamese person is yellow , belongs to the yellow race . 
  it 's no different from saying that obama is black , or that trump is white . 
  i have a feeling that this problem is stemming from the american unwillingness to call people yellows ( since it does sound the same as blacks , pretty bad ) , so asian in the us specifies the race instead of the continent . 
  but knowing us states it not the same as knowing european countries , us is a single entity internationally , while europe is n't . 
  expecting somebody to know all the us states is equivalent to : expecting somebody to know all the russian oblasts , krains , republics , federal cities , etc. , expecting to know all the swiss cantons , all the german states . 
   it also does not help that our defense structures ( and even parties ) tend to have 5th column cells that come up with brilliant plans on how to get rid of conscription or to get rid of a separate border guard or any similar dismantling initiative ( they usually call it streamlining or restructuring ) . 
  and western european talking heads have been an `` inspiration '' in all of that . 
  i 've got to ask when you say 5th column , who is it exactly . 
  is is the russian parties or estonian ones ? 
  everything you said is true . 
  i was kinda ranting also , since all the time people from the baltics bitch how they need more nato protection . 
  but you have to admit they 're not doing all they can . 
  then again you can compare the baltics to us , we 're in a pretty similar situation and our military is doing way better , the only part that has real problems with us is our non-exsistent airforce , and the general lack of troops because we 're attempting to pull of a professional army with only 4 million people . 
  as seen during the last few years majority of european armies are in a , well shit state . 
  take stuff listed here with a grain of salt a lot of it is sourced from what i remember reading on / k / . 
  libya showed a general lack of logistic capabilities . 
  france one of the best equipped armies in europe and one that does most military operations abroad managed to run out of bombs ( dumb ones not smart ones , even us runs out of smart ones ) within a week and had to resort to concrete ones used for practice . 
  afaik french also have a nasty problem that they no longer manufacture bullets and the majority of the famas rifles in the french army , which uses first generation famas , is incompatible with standard nato rounds , so they have a shortage of bullets , the second generation is compatible but is so far only used by the french navy . 
  dutch army does n't have enough bullets to train their troops . 
  germans had the incident with the broom handles instead of machine guns , which germany having the biggest industry in eu should n't happen . 
  also the whole nh90 helicopter being bought by a bunch of eu navies and having problems handling salt due to corrosion . 
  and lets not get started on the baltic countries , which while individually small put together have about 6 million people which is enough to at least have an israeli level army , but have fuck all . 
  from what i can gather right now of wikipedia all three put together have 3 tanks and all are latvian but t-55s . 
  also lets not forget the problem that about a quarter of estonian and latvian population are russians , and from what i can gather from online sources , they 're serious russian nationalists . 
  also the fact that all three countries have a huge emigration of non-russian population . 
  russians have shown their work in syria , they 're logistics are capable enough of operating abroad at least in a limited sense ( not even close to the us , but then again they do n't have to be ) . 
  also keep in mind that russians have mandatory conscription ( and with ~ 150 million people that 's a lot of troops ) , also operate professional troops , and have stockpiles and stockpiles of military equipment . 
  the country has around 22000 tanks all together , most is in storage and of questionable state of being and the majority are t-72s , but still we are talking about a quarter of all the tanks on the planet . 
  europe does n't need a unified army , but it needs countries that actually try to have one . 
  france , uk , germany should actually invest money , maybe put back conscription , actually develop logistics and stockpiles of equipment that they can count on in case of war , bring back production even if subsidized . 
  baltics should stop complaining and start forming an army , if croatia , with our completely shit economy , can have 72 m-84s ( upgraded t-72s ) you ca n't tell me baltics ca n't manage more than 3 t-55s . 
  the only countries in europe that are actually trying are russia , norway , finland and poland . 
  reminds of the news headlines when napoleon escaped from elba .

   what ? 
  i have not heard a dumber thing in this subreddit ... 
  so if russia captures latvia tomorrow , latvians become `` native to russian federation '' ? 
  yes they would , look at the uk multiple native ethnicities not all of whom have joined willingly . 
  shit my own nation was oppressed for the major part of the 20th century , but independence has to be fought for , something that the latvians are unwilling to do . 
  latvians obviously do n't care about their nation , for one they did n't solve the 25 % + part of the population that 's russian , they 're emigrating en masse into western europe . 
  as i said elsewhere in this thread , both st. petersburg and moscow are within striking distance of srbms , mount some vx warheads on those . 
   that 's how you talk about animals - not people who have a misfortune of having their land captured by russia . 
  humans are animals . 
   so , just because they subjugated a majority of ossetians , they have a claim to subjugating all of them ? 
  never said that , learn to read . 
   i am not following your logic . 
  the south ossetians are neither russian citizens nor ethnic russians . 
  the russian federation is a multiethnic country , it 's not a russian nation state . 
  ossetians are an ethnicity native to the russian federation . 
  or do you think that all nations should have their nation states ? 
  should we carve up russia for the tens of nationalities native to it , ukraine for the rusyns , scandinavian countries for the sami , middle east for kurds , and us and canada for all the various native american nations living in them ? 
  well nothing so far was about expansion of influence , it was about retaining existing influence in face of expanding us influence . 
  abkhazia , south ossetia , donbass , they 're all to stop these countries from allying with the us . 
  with regards to baltics a threat exists , at least with estonia and latvia , due to the large russian population , and also the diminishing latvian/estonian population . 
  but they should 've cleaned the country in the 90s , any attempt now will legitimize russian intervention . 
  but the fact remains that eastern european countries ca n't count on the us , france , germany or uk , after all `` why die for tallinn '' . 
  the only surefire defence against russia are nuclear weapons , but considering that no country in eastern europe has the economy capable of developing or supporting nuclear weapons the best solution would be taking advantage of proximity of major russian population centers to the baltics and going the route of the middle eastern dictators . 
  nerve gas warheads mounted on srbms . 
  south ossetia has no russians , but it does have ossetians , and considering that the majority of ossetians live in north ossetia and are russian citizens , they claim they 're defending them . 
  russia has plenty of nationalities that are n't russians but are native to russia and exists almost solely within russia . 
  this whole attempt to go after legally owned swiss guns just gives credence to right-wing claims that the eu is trying to disarm the continent so that the muslims can take over . 
  that 's exactly why it 's meaningless . 
  country is filled with assault rifles , mortars , manpads , manpats , and various other weapons , all of which are already illegal . 
  but outside of going house to house and searching every backyard and field you wo n't be able to take them away . 
  it 's almost exactly the same thing as with the us , the pandora 's box has been opened and there is no closing it . 
  well russians are working on the s-500 which is supposed to have anti-icbm capability . 
  but i get what you 're saying . 
  iirc either britain or france , ca n't remember which , only really has one ballistic submarine out at sea , others are getting maintenance done on them or are docked or used for training . 
  if s-500 gets actual anti-icbm capabilities and you manage to knock out half the subs , they pretty much have no deterrent . 
  france at least still has nuclear capable bombers . 
  but the biggest problem i think is the fact that neither france nor uk have industrial capacity to maintain the same number of warheads and delivery systems that russia and us can . 
   not really , anti-icbm systems are n't really good enough to negate that many warheads . 
  france has somewhere around 300 warheads correct ? 
  if russians actually ** manage ** to make s-500 into an ** effective anti-icbm ** system , and ** it is a big if ** but still , they will negate your arsenal . 
   also with every development in anti-icbm systems there are counter developments in counter measures to the counter measures . 
  afaik none of them are being done by france , only russians and chinese are working on them , like the hypersonic gliders or quasi-ballistic missiles . 
  ebola is an extremely shitty biological weapon , for one it has an incubation period from only 2 days up to 21 , so you 're operatives wo n't be able to spread it far . 
  secondary it 's too deadly which causes it to burn itself out . 
  there 's a reason why there have n't been any wide ranging ebola epidemics before 2013 . 
  if it 's treatable and not seriously deadly , you nuke the shit out of the country that did it and then after a week have healthy population . 
  you know how they say that using nuclear weapons would cause a country to be ostracized globally , well using biological weapons would make you a legitimate target for nuclear weapons . 
  you can do it also in france but you have to be a bit closer , ca n't do it with icbms , but there are plenty of tactical weapons with sub-kiloton yields . 
  you 're overestimating the effectiveness of biological weapons and underestimating the development costs . 
  for one they could be extremely easy to stop by proper use of quarantine ( e.g. 
  '72 smallpox epidemic in yugoslavia ) . 
  second you 're saying 2 week incubation , how many disease have the proper incubation period that are also deadly enough ? 
  you 'll have to do a fair bit of development which is gon na take decades and cost you a lot of money . 
  third you 're operatives are gon na get caught by intelligence agencies . 
  biological agents have a shelf life , you 'll have to constantly smuggle fresh agents into the country which will raise suspicions . 
  and last your own population is certain to get infected and also die by millions . 
  there 's a reason most countries have given up on biological weapons , or have at least made their development an extreme non priority . 
  you do n't .
