  strike does not affect medical care for patients much . 
  * since publication of register of defenders ( in war of independence ) police raised 30 charges and are considering 1230 more . 
  they suspect that those person appeared on the list illegally through falsification of documents . 
  and except for usual `` we are unemployed and gdp is low '' that 's basically it . 
  slow week in croatia . 
  this is the problem . 
  it 's not us the people who changed the law and cheated eu , it 's our idiotic politicians . 
  in fact , this is one of the rare things that big majority of croatian people agree in , we should extradite the man . 
  no one have any clue what the fuck is wrong with our prime minister , everybody is saying do it , people , media , president ... and yet he is not doing it . 
  and there is not much i can do . 
  ( except for not voting for them next time . ), 
  so yeah , unless you meant `` one idiot who is in charge '' when you said `` you guys changed the law '' , you are exaggerating . 
  will send one from dubrovnik , croatia , pm me the address . 
  i do n't know about the others but i certainly did n't downvote you . 
  also , you can express your opinion regardless the downvotes . 
  those are just reddit points , who cares ? 
  it does n't matter what they could or could n't . 
  it 's a law that needs to be obeyed . 
  we discussed this few days ago on / r/croatia . 
  i am ** strongly ** against these protest . 
  i also live in war affected area and i would have 0 things against cyrillic if serbs were minority here . 
  that 's because we are no longer in war and i would expect to be treated equally in serbia if , for example , our official alphabet was something else . 
  this protest is mostly nationalistic and it should be treated like that . 
  what do those people think ? 
  that vukovar will suddenly become serbian town because of few cyrillic signs ? 
  i hope it 's 1 gbps per university . 
  i just started college here in dubrovnik and can also get up to 100/100 . 
  talked a little bit about it with person who is administrator of everything technology related and he said that we could even get up to 1 gbps , so i wanted to know do we just need new equipment or completely new link to carnet . 
  well , not that it would make a huge difference but it would be nice to surf the internet on 1 gbps speed . 
  also , my torrentleech ratio would be thankfull . 
  do you have any clue of when optics could be widely available in croatia ? 
  also , this carnet picture , does 1 gbps to , for example , dubrovnik means that all schools and universities can have that speed combined so that it adds up to 1 gbps ? 
  well it 's not like it 's something that citizens of croatia did n't want to happen and eu forced it on us . 
  majority of population was actually for extradition and politicians were against for reason known only to them . 
  to translate poll : * he should be prosecuted in croatia * he should be extradited to germany * i have no idea, 
  basically what politicians are saying : `` we can prosecute him in croatia . 
  why would we extradite him to germany ? 
  that would be like admitting that our juridical system is not good enough when in fact it is . '', 
  what is really the case ? 
  no one knows but rumors are that he knows too much . 
  severina is somewhat big star in croatia but mostly listened by little girls age 8 - 12 . 
  also , porn tape of her leaked on internet so that helped her to gain popularity among older population . 
  coming from narrowest part of croatia ( some 1 km from sea to border ) this does n't bother me slightest . 
  we have sea , beaches and just over the hill is the greatest lamb meat money can buy . 
  here 's photo of the area . 
  just over the hill is bosnia . 
  i knew it you would deliver !, 
  summoning / u/bezbojnicul to make a nice map including all the data listed . 
  classic example of sensationalism , while google did say something along those lines , context is really important . 
  read this article , probably the only one looking at the whole situation objectively . 
  same here , also 0 meters of bike lanes does n't help it at all . 
  i live in touristy place and i swear that in 90 % percent of almost accidents on the road i check the plates and it 's italian . 
  of course , anecdotal evidence but still ... 
  though it could be that i expect it to be italian so i only notice it when it is . 
  but why visit zagreb now ? 
  during summer when there is too much heat and too little people . 
  imho during summer it 's better to visit one of many cities on croatian coast and then in fall or spring visit zagreb . 
  there are few people in dubrovnik that are starting to be vocal about having dubrovnik republic again . 
  i mean , i know it 's probably not good idea for us but man , if they do n't build that bridge and highway in near future i can only see more people joining the movement . 
  large portion of countries have one main official government profile . 
  but it 's true , some of them have few and some of them have politicians that are more influential on twitter than official profiles . 
  this one . 
  from where i gathered data there was none on bosnia . 
  thought about it but did n't do it , do n't know why . 
  maybe i will do it again that way since it 's just an easy fix to change colors . 
  in this case because as far as i know bosnia does n't have official government twitter account . 
  sorry , no data for iceland . 
  official twitter profiles of governments and if country does n't have it then official profile of ministry of foreign affairs . 
  yes , made by me using data from [ here ] ( http://twiplomacy.com/ ) . 
  i used ~ ~ twits ~ ~ tweets per day from official country government accounts or if that was not available from official accounts of ministry of foreign affairs . 
  my first infographic map so there might be some mistakes . 
  just for example , caffe bars , restaurants etc. 
  compared to june last year had shown 59 % more turnover as a result of fiscalisation , and total turnover from all services went up almost about 20 % . 
  those are some huge numbers . 
  yup , there is 100 % recycling of plastic bottles . 
  there is a joke that if you threw your bottle in the air , someone will take it before it hits the floor . 
   it can be used in any context you would like . 
  ah , i see , thanks for explaining . 
  i knew there is a reason why i upvoted you [ 20 times so far ] ( http://i.imgur.com/1pswpyp.png ) . 
  ok , as a croatian i am in the eu but not yet in schengen area but i still can move freely across europe . 
  can someone explain to me what will be different when one day when we eventually join schengen ? 
  this prescription thing is also being applied in croatia as of last year . 
  very useful . 
  man , if you are ever in croatia , just do n't say it 's capital is belgrade . 
  even though i agree that average croat is nationalist , i would say average croat redditor is not . 
  the wind is probably [ bura ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bura_\\ ( wind \\ ) ) . 
  waiting for 2cellos , they are the greatest . 
  edit : too short !, 
  ** croatia ** * ** we are entering eu ** * merkel is not coming to parteeey . 
  no , really , that 's the only news around here . 
  yes it is . 
  edit : july, 
  if it 's on monday ( as it usually is ) , it got to be croatia !, 
  that 's the day we are entering eu . 
  here is a great and thorough read for you and anybody interested in corruption in croatia and how thing are indeed getting better . 
  i mean , jailing pm should be sign enough that no one is untouchable . 
  how expensive is it ? 
  as dalmatin i have to disagree , we are not lazy we are just in state of `` fjaka '' . 
  fjaka is psychophysical state of striving for nothing . 
  it 's common mistake to replace fjaka with laziness .
