  the greatest `` whores '' in all history have been men . 
  do n't forget that . 
  some of the earliest myths/stories/gods / paintings/symbols/engravings about `` sacrifice '' and `` resurrection '' were about goddesses and not male gods , so hence why you never `` saw '' anything before . 
  besides even ancient greek myths and legends and art have this concept over and over again in stories , later on represented in european art paintings . 
  '' `` it is certain , that , however much the male element had proclaimed itself ... by the days of the minoan civilization ( 3000 -- 1100 bc ) , the religion still continued to manifest the matriarchal period of social progress . 
  clearly the goddess was supreme . . '' -- sir arthur evans . 
  the collapse of the fertility goddess concluded roughly after the fall of the roman empire via the succession of judeo-christianity in the fourth century ad , of which reform then included the systematization for the ransacking and closure of all temples throughout europe and the middle east on an unprecedented scale . 
  to many early cultures prior to this climax however , her reverence outside of the supernatural domain initially stemmed far back into prehistory through the astronomical and cyclic thanksgivings of all organic lifeforms on earth , and thus became agronomically regarded as very towering figure in antiquity . 
  much like today , this methodology of the heavens derived itself downwards from the exploration for the source of life , and revolved purely around the glorification of birth , death and rebirth , or as seen divergent to the preternatural , or unnatural realm of literal necromantic revival of the flesh . 
  as in the words of elaine pagels : `` other religions celebrated the cycles of birth and death ; christianity insists in the one unique historical moment where this cycle is reversed , and that a dead man literally came back to life '' . 
  despite this vampire transformation act , her eminence inside creationism was often foremost with her figure solemnly being accredited exclusively as providing new birth always to objects that had seemed dead . 
  analogous words like ` womb ' , ` tomb ' , ` resurrection ' , ` regeneration ' , ` renewal , ` procreation ' , ` origination ' , ` genesis ' , ` birth ' , ` rebirth ' , ` conception ' and so forth all still have their deepest origins with her fertility cults . 
  as promulgated by sigmund freud , `` our current organized system is reproduced from mother nature , with the observation of these great astronomical regulations giving man not only the model for the introduction of order into his own life , but the very first clues about how to do it . '', 
  multitudes of people in antiquity regarded her as the queen of heaven , alongside that of a mother earth incorporating all the physical elements from which everything was produced . 
  in rome , writers such as apuleius adjudged her simply as the mother of the gods . 
  to the philosopher plotinus , she was the image of creation itself . 
  [ historians such as diodorus siculus noted that she even held greater power than the king in egypt . 
  '' ] ( http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/biblianazar/esp_biblianazar_33.htm ) '' <  the fish of pisces represented by the 12th sign of the zodiac , encapsulated with two crescent moons , one waxing , one waning , is but one of the most oldest symbols used by early christians to identify themselves with the new king of the gods , as distinguished by the `` fisher of men '' . 
  the apostles peter , james , andrew and john all were additionally portrayed as fishermen . 
  in the 2nd century , one of the early christian fathers tertullian wrote accordingly of this saying : `` but we , the christians , are little fishes after the type of our great fish jesus christ , born in the water '' . 
  popular hymns later referred to jesus as `` the little fish which the virgin caught in the fountain '' . 
  in greek though , the fish became known as `` icthys '' , which too was later nominated as the icon of jesus in hebrew afterwards used as an acrostic from the greek `` iesous christos theou hyios soter '' or `` jesus christ , of god the sun/son , saviour '' . 
  this ichthys , fish of the water , also became known as the offspring sun of the ancient sea and moon goddess which had long been a central figure to much early mythologies revolving around the zodiac when jupiter entered into aries the ram through pisces . 
  this fish symbol virtually attached itself to an array of ancient moon deities due to this lunary orb governing the sea and tides , as according to pliny , along for which the enquiry of the heavens too became a profession held down exclusively by women who promulgated the changes of seasons and the harvest , such as designing calendars , predicting eclipses and forecasting the future . 
  even at one of the most important and oldest sanctuaries in greece , `` delphos/delphi '' also meant `` whale '' and `` womb '' , from where the pythia ( pythoness ) oracle received her prophesies and where the greeks consulted preceding a major operation . 
  plutarch , a famed priest at delphi recounted that after the sun god apollo defeated python and presided over delphi for 9 months , that the shrine was afterwards then appointed back to the maenads of dionysus for preparation of rebirth . 
  in the eleusinian mysteries of the goddess demeter , initiation further included a baptism in seawater signifying rebirth , with a greeting to the rising of the new moon after three nights of dark skies taking place . 
  the roman writer apuleius even related that the goddess aphrodite salacia was the fish swarming womb that carried the reincarnated sun god palaemon , just as empedocles conjured water as manifesting the tears of the goddess persophone . 
  in india , it was vritas and danu , or in persia , it became the goddess anahita who governed the waters . 
  in babylonia , it was the solar tale of the fish goddess derceto/atargatis with the god oannes/joannes , including also nammu and tiamat . 
  in the biblical tale , like jesus born from mary , or maria , from where marine , or where water comes from became rendered through oannes/jonah , who allegorically did the same exploit inside the womb/tomb of the world 's largest sea mammal . '', 
  `` many , perhaps most , pagan religions in the mediterranean area had a major seasonal day of religious celebration at or following the spring equinox . 
  cybele , the phrygian fertility goddess , had a consort , attis , who was believed to have been born via a virgin birth . 
  attis was believed to have died and been resurrected each year during the period mar-22 to mar-25 . 
  gerald l. berry , author of `` religions of the world , '' wrote : `` about 200 b.c. 
  mystery cults began to appear in rome just as they had earlier in greece . 
  most notable was the cybele cult centered on vatican hill ... associated with the cybele cult was that of her lover , attis ( the older tammuz , osiris , dionysus , or orpheus under a new name ) . 
  he was a god of ever-reviving vegetation . 
  born of a virgin , he died and was reborn annually . 
  the festival began as a day of blood on black friday and culminated after three days in a day of rejoicing over the resurrection . '', 
  3 wherever christian worship of jesus and pagan worship of attis were active in the same geographical area in ancient times , christians : '' ... used to celebrate the death and resurrection of jesus on the same date ; and pagans and christians used to quarrel bitterly about which of their gods was the true prototype and which the imitation . '', 
  many religious historians and liberal theologians believe that the death and resurrection legends were first associated with attis , many centuries before the birth of jesus . 
  they were simply grafted onto stories of jesus ' life in order to make christian theology more acceptable to pagans . 
  others suggest that many of the events in jesus ' life that were recorded in the gospels were lifted from the life of krishna , the second person of the hindu trinity , or were taken from the life of horus , an egyptian god . 
  ancient christians had an alternative explanation ; they claimed that satan had created counterfeit deities in advance of the coming of christ in order to confuse humanity . 
  4 modern-day christians generally regard the attis and horus legends as being a pagan myths of little value with no connection to jesus . 
  [ they regard jesus ' death and resurrection account as being true , and unrelated to the earlier tradition .

  horses are usually used for treatment therapy of children with special needs , autism , down syndrome etc since the horse and the kid kind of have to depend and understand one another , it helps the kid with balance . 
  the movements of the horse help with the rider 's muscle tones , decreases spasms , relaxes , de-stresses , and the kids learn to walk and balance better because they can comprehend the horse 's movements and balance during therapy . 
  the therapy is usually free in croatia , and sponsored by the government , ngos , donations etc for quite a few conditions/genetic disorders etc. 
  while i am unaware of any actual medical studies , some people do report that horse riding or jogging or running can kind of help the kidney stones to pass since your body is moving around/bouncing around . 
  the kidney stones get `` jiggled '' about i guess . 
  never heard that anyone stole a horse because of kidney stones before though . 
  lmao he could have just asked for a couple of rides . 
  if you 're into male dominators , just sign up for military service and you 'll never be asked to think with your own head again . 
  sure , you 're supposed to call the authority sir instead of daddy , but honestly , what 's the difference ? 
  i 'd stay away from religious leaders , i heard they like their followers younger ... 
  wait , is ordering people around or killing people and sending kids to idiotic wars not good ? 
  color me surprised . 
  then again i do enjoy it immensely when peeps shit themselves over the fact that we still have streets named after this or that communist daddyo . 
  like they did n't suck the socialist parties ' toes when they were in power and looked the other way . 
  such heroism to yap about it now . 
  lmao, 
  the what now ? 
  did you mean `` vrag '' ? 
  yeshua ( hebrew , to rescue , to deliver ) -- yehoshuah ( hebrew ) -- iesous ( koine greek ) -- iesus ( latin ) -- jesus ( english ) early psychology ? 
  these theories are older than `` jesus '' , let alone psychology in europe . 
  sighs , ah well , the sheep are sheep for a reason . 
  yeshua in hebrew is a verbal derivative from `` to rescue '' , `` to deliver '' . 
  `` yeshua ( \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 , with vowel pointing \u05d9\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7 -- y\u0113\u0161\u016b\u0103 ` in hebrew ) was a common alternative form of the name \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05bb\u05c1\u05e2\u05b7 ( `` yehoshuah '' -- joshua ) in later books of the hebrew bible and among jews of the second temple period . 
  the name corresponds to the greek spelling iesous , from which , through the latin iesus , comes the english spelling jesus . '', 
  `` yod he vau he '' is n't a name . 
  meh , whatever . 
  wait til you hear about other monotheistic religions ... bring back the pagans , at least they knew how to party !, 
  i see . 
  yeah , there are many , many cray cray names out there . 
  well , have faith in yourselves and everything is possible with or without a `` name . '', 
  then just leave the name since it 's stuck and do n't doubt it . 
  best of luck and rock on !,
