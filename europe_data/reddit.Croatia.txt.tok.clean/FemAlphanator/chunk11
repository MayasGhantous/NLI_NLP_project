  iesous christos or `` savior anointed ( by god ) . '', 
  eh , there are so many theories by now , and i 've forgotten most of the `` sunday school '' teachings , and it 's kind of all confusing to be honest . 
  look , personally and relatively objectively , i take the scriptures as partially mistranslated , chopped up and edited so many times that maybe some of it will never be understood completely . 
  on the other hand , there are some theories that `` jesus christ '' is actually every person in a way in a spiritual sense , a part of our conscious mind that can `` save us '' with faith and the immaculate ( emmanuel ? 
  heh or god is within you ) conception is the unconscious mind of every person so some of the deeper understanding of these scriptures is ; virgin mary ( unconscious mind , the `` holy spirit '' ( one whole interconnected with all that is ) or the collective unconscious ) , jesus ( a new consciousness , transformation through symbolic death and symbolic resurrection or simply changing your `` mindset '' and letting go of the `` ego '' in part ) , and `` god '' ( individual conscious mind making choices in life , the giver and the taker , the judge and the judged ) . 
  basically , when the `` savior '' says `` you are the light of the world '' and `` ask and you shall receive etc '' the message could be interpreted as `` look , you human trolls , you create your own individual reality and this is the `` gift '' of life and the secret of living given by the `` higher power '' or perhaps as some believe the `` all-mother/all-father '' of creation or universe or whoever or whatever is beyond our current understanding . 
  so life is a `` give and receive '' game in a way , and what you give to the world , you receive in turn , what you think and feel as true becomes your reality , whenever you forgive someone their debts your debts in turn shall be forgiven no matter if you have no idea how because `` my ways are past finding out '' etc etc. 
  hence why the kind of extreme altruism of `` pray for your enemies and forgive them etc '' because there are no outside enemies technically speaking until you yourself return their anger/fear/hatred and become your own enemy by conscious choice . 
  we live in a `` reality '' that reflects or mirrors us . 
  so imagine if you were some sort of all-powerful deity and were creating the universe ... what do you make all creation out of ? 
  well , you make everything out of your own self ( or own image , imagination , cloth ) and thus you become everyone and everything in different shape , form , and are truly omnipresent and know and see everything in a way . 
  so you give individuals free choice as a way of ultimate love and forgiveness because no matter what one does they must return to `` creator '' one way or another , because there is no `` outer deity '' since you 're part of the creator and creation . 
  do n't you usually have to make a name for a company and/or product or service as simple and direct in meaning and explanation and representation of the product and/or service and what it does so that even the most obtuse consumer ( s ) can get the direct marketing message hint within the brand name/product name/service name ? 
  romania the pwetty !, 
  which corruption , the one from the bottom of the pyramid or the top ? 
  what you resist , persists . 
  you 've got to be kidding me . 
  so many confused lost sheep , so little time . 
  the name/word/title `` jesus '' comes from the greek iesous , and means `` saviour '',

  beautiful !, 
  ca n't wait to go !, 
  i do n't care for your linguistic ignorance , i am pointing out your ignorance of history . 
  let 's go back to the root and origin shall we now ... `` allat , also spelled allatu , alilat , all\u0101t , and al-l\u0101t ( arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u062a pronounced [ \u00e6l\u02c8l\u00e6\u02d0t ] ) is the name of a goddess worshipped in pre-islamic arabia . 
  together with man\u0101t and al - ` uzz\u00e1 , she was one of the three chief goddesses of mecca . '', 
  `` what is the meaning of ilah ? 
  \u02beil\u0101h ( arabic : \u0625\u0644\u0647 ; plural : \u0622\u0644\u0647\u0629 \u02be\u0101lihah ) is an arabic term meaning `` deity '' or `` god '' . 
  the feminine is \u02beil\u0101hah ( \u0625\u0644\u0627\u0647\u0629 , meaning `` goddess '' ) ; with the article , it appears as al-\u02beil\u0101hah \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0644\u0627\u0647\u0629 . 
  it appears in the name of the monotheistic god of islam as al-l\u0101h , translated , that is , `` the god '' . '', 
  `` asherah is a semitic mother goddess , wife and consort of the ugaritic el . 
  many modern scholars of ancient israelite mythology suggest , in part based on jeremiah 's claim that she is the queen of heaven , she was the wife or consort to the warrior god/sky god , yahweh . '', 
  funny how some of those female goddesses across cultures , went from being an all-mother usually creating the life ( light ) through parthenogenesis to being a consort ... http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230618862 then again ... `` the idea of a single male deity is unique to our modern era . 
  in all the ancient cultures , the elohim was a male and female . 
  in egypt it was osiris ( masculine ) and isis ( feminine ) . 
  in canaan it was el and elat ( also known as asherah ) . 
  to the greeks it was zeus and hera . 
  to the romans it was jupiter and juno . 
  to the germans it was odin and frigg . 
  i am not necessarily trying to make the claim that the elohim of the bible are a god and goddess , just that the attributes of elohim are both masculine and feminine . '', 
  belarus is stunning , what the hell are you yapping about ? 
  belarusophobia on the rise !, 
  allat = goddess of the underworld in pagan history of pre-islamic arabia , kind of similar to allah would n't you say ? 
  basically it 's all traced back to pagan cults , the same way as judaism and christianity are . 
  did you know that the earliest myths about sacrifice and resurrection had a female goddess not a male one ? 
  hehehe, 
  ah yes , the solar-lunar-saturnalia cults everyone worships as male cloud deities . 
  top lulz . 
  not sure if humanity deserves anything else but their illusions .

  actually native americans ( indians which is a name derived from columbus ' shitty spanish where wrote that they were made in god ( en/in dios = indios ) people when he came across the natives , or tainos , or the names of sepcific tribes sioux , cherokee etc ) are n't exactly native to america ... http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-clovis-point-and-the-discovery-of-americas-first-culture-3825828/ `` who are the clovis people ? 
  the clovis culture is a prehistoric native american culture that first appears in the archaeological record of north america around 13,500 years ago , at the end of the last ice age . 
  the culture is named for artifacts found near clovis , new mexico , where the first evidence of this tool complex was excavated in 1932 . 
  what is the clovis theory ? 
  since the mid 20th century , the standard theory among archaeologists has been that the clovis people were the first inhabitants of the americas . 
  the primary support of the theory was that no solid evidence of pre-clovis human inhabitation has been found . 
  ( well actually ... more evidence has come up http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070223-first-americans.html ) who were the original inhabitants of north america ? 
  the question of who colonized the americas , and when , has long been hotly debated . 
  traditionally , native americans are believed to have descended from northeast asia , arriving over a land bridge between siberia and alaska some 12,000 years ago and then migrating across north and south america . '', 
  yes , we can !, 
  i worked when i was actually 15 and not `` born on january 1st 19xx but have no papers '' and the world did n't stop turning . 
  yeah , why blame migrants ... 
  when they harass a woman , it 's just cultural misunderstanding or sexual emergency . 
  when they stab or steal or bomb , it 's because someone did n't pet their balls enough ... look sweetie , if they 're willing to `` fight '' against food , steal , beat up each other then maybe they could have stayed in their cultures and fight for their own people instead . 
  you 're a moral relativist , not cultural . 
  stealing , harassing , protesting food , refusing to shake a female teacher 's hand , setting some camps on fire ( previous incidents ) is n't culture , it 's lack of culture . 
  good think it 's not racist to deny an individual 's personal responsibility and agency ... oh wait !,

  `` the spanish word for whore , puta , derives from the latin term for a well , but the latin term for grave , literally `` a hole in the earth , '' is puticuli , meaning womb of rebirth . 
  these terms for whore were not derogatory . 
  the latin term had its root in the vedic , an early sanskrit language , wherein the word puta is defined as pure and holy . 
  the cave , the pit , the hole , and the bottomless black lake were metaphors for the great goddess , she who is unnameable , that darkness primordial from which all life ( light ) is born . 
  she is the everything and the nothing -- hole-y , holy , wholly . '',
