  `` the exact origin and meaning of the ethnonym hrvat ( proto-slavic * x\u044arv\u00e1t\u044a [ 3 ] [ 4 ] ) is not known and still subject to scientific dispute . 
  it is believed , that the word might not be of native slavic lexical stock , but a borrowing . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] common theories from the 20th century derive it from an iranian origin , [ 7 ] the root word being a third-century scytho-sarmatian form attested in the tanais tablets as \u03a7\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03ac\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 ( khoro\u00e1thos , alternate forms comprise khor\u00f3atos and khoro\u00faathos ) . 
  [ 2 ] this form was used to substantiate the derivation of proto-slavic * x\u044arvat\u044a from the old persian xaraxwat - , attested by the old iranian toponym harahvait - , the native name of arachosia . 
  [ 4 ] `` arachosia '' is the latinized form of ancient greek \u1f08\u03c1\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ( arachos\u00ed\u0101 ) ; in old persian inscriptions , the region is referred to as harahuvati\u0161 ( harauvatii\u0161a ) . 
  [ 8 ] in indo-iranian it actually means `` one that pours into ponds '' , which derives from the name of the mythological sarasvati river . 
  [ 9 ] however , although the somewhat suggestive similarity , the connection to the name of arachosia is etymologically incorrect . 
  [ 9 ] the first etymological thesis about the name of the croats stems from constantine porphyrogennetos ( tenth century ) , who connected the different names of the croats , \u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7\u03c1\u03c9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 and \u03a7\u03c1\u03c9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 ( belokhrobatoi and khrobatoi ) , with the greek word \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1 ( kh\u1e53ra , `` land '' ) : `` croats in slavic language means those who have many lands '' . 
  in the 13th century , thomas the archdeacon considered that it was connected with the name of inhabitants of the krk isle , which he gave as curetes , curibantes . 
  in the 17th century , juraj ratkaj found a reflexion of the verb hrvati ( se ) `` to wrestle '' in the name . 
  [ 10 ] in the 19th century , many different propositions were given , in order to interpret the croatian ethnonym : josef dobrovsk\u00fd believed it to be linked to the root * hrev `` tree '' , whereas johann kaspar zeuss linked it to * haru `` sword '' ; s. mikucki connected it with old-indian \u0161arv - `` strike '' ; pavel jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik derived it from xr\u044ab\u044at\u044a , xrib\u044at\u044a , xrib\u044a `` ridge , highlanders '' , whereas f. miklo\u0161i\u010d from hr\u044av ( hr\u016dv ) `` dance '' ; \u0110 . dani\u010di\u0107 considered its root to be * sar - `` guard , protect '' ; l. geitler considered that the lithuanian words \u0161\u00e1rvas `` armor '' and \u0161arv\u00faotas `` cuirassier '' were related to the ethnonym ; fyodor a. braun saw the german harfada ( harva\u00f0a fj\u00f6llum from hervarar saga ok hei\u00f0reks ) , which would be the german name of the carpathian mountains , as the origin of an intermediate form harvata ; also rudolf much connected it with a proto-germanic word hruvat - `` horned '' , or -- as z. go\u0142\u0105b proposed -- `` warriors clad with horn-armour '' , as a self-designation . 
  [ 11 ] the 20th century gave rise to many new interpretations of the origin of the name of the croats : a. i. sobolevski derived it from the iranian words hu - `` good '' , ravah - `` space , freedom '' and suffix - at - ; g. a. ilyinsky derived it from * kher - `` cut '' , as seen in the greek word k\u00e1rkharos `` sharp '' , kharah `` tough , sharp '' , and xorbr\u044a `` brave '' ; hermann hirt saw a connection with the name of a germanic tribe harudes ( \u03a7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 ) ; a. bruckner linked it with slovak charbati se `` to oppose '' or via sk\u044arv - / x\u044arv - to the lithuanian \u0161\u00e1rvas `` armor '' ; k. o\u0161tir considered valid the connection with an unspecified thraco-illyrian word x\u044arvata - `` hill '' ; max vasmer first considered it as a loanword from old-iranian , haurvat\u0101 `` shepherd '' ( avestan haurvaiti means `` pasturage '' ) , later also from old-iranian hu-urvatha - `` friend '' ( also accepted by n. 
  [ 10 ] zupani\u010d additionally proposed lezgian origin from xhurava ( community ) and plural suffix - th , meaning `` municipalities , communities '' . 
  [ 12 ] m. budimir saw in the name a reflexion of indo-european * skwos `` gray , grayish '' , which in lithuanian gave \u0161irvas ; s. k. saka\u010d linked it with the avestan name harahvait\u012b , which once signified the southwestern part of modern afghanistan , the province arachosia . 
  [ 3 ] g. vernadsky considered a connection to the chorasm\u00ed from khwarezm , [ 13 ] while f. dvornik a link to the krevatades or krevatas located in the caucasus mentioned in the de ceremoniis ( tenth century ) . 
  [ 13 ] v. miller saw in the croatian name the iranian hvar - `` sun '' and va - `` bed '' , while p. tedesco had a similar interpretation from iranian huravant `` sunny '' ; o. kronsteiner derived it from tatar-bashkir * chr `` free '' and * vata `` to fight , to wage war '' . 
  [ 3 ] from the iranian theses the most accepted is the derivation by oleg trubachyov from * xar-va ( n ) t ( feminine , rich in women , ruled by women ) , which derives from the etymology of sarmatians name , [ 14 ] [ 7 ] the indo-aryan * sar-ma ( n ) t `` feminine '' , in both indo-iranian adjective suffix - ma ( n ) t/wa ( n ) t , and indo-aryan and the indo-iranian * sar - `` woman '' , which in iranian gives * har - . 
  [ 14 ] according to radoslav kati\u010di\u0107 this thesis does n't entirely abide with the croatian ethnonym , as the original form was hr\u044avate not h\u044arvate , [ 15 ] and the vowel `` a '' in the desired iranian harvat - is short , while in slavic hr\u044avate it is long . 
  [ 16 ] kati\u010di\u0107 concluded that of all the etymological considerations the iranian is at least unlikely . 
  [ 16 ] [ 17 ] the medieval latin name `` cro\u0101tia '' is derived from north-west slavic xrovat - , by liquid metathesis from common slavic * xorvat - , from proto-slavic , i. e. iranian , * xarw\u0101t - . 
  [ 18 ] the croatian ethnonym hrvat in the kajkavian dialect also comes in the form horvat , while in the chakavian dialect in the form harvat .
