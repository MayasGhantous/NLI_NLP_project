well , they 're not soviet apartment blocks , are they ? 
   they 're just socialist . 
  we ( yugoslavia ) were strong enough to remain independent of sssr , even though we were socialist . 
  honestly i like socialist architecture . 
  made to last , unlike the glass buildings we do now ... 
  but at the moment the country is mostly going to shit . 
  tourism is one of our economic pillars which is nice but pathetic , since we used to actually do important stuff back then ... 
  how well did we mask the fact that everything is falling apart ? 
  my city had a sewer system more than 1300 years ago . 
  we officially abolished slavery around that time as well . 
  honestly nothing in america can compare . 
  you might have some stuff that 's a couple of years old but here it 's ** common ** to find structures built in the ancient times thousands of years ago . 
  or the balkans ... 
  that sounds incredibly fun brate, 
  got any sources on that ? 
  did n't learn about that on my history class . 
  even if it 's true , i would n't care , because muslim society was the center of advancement of science , mathematics , and philosophy during much of the middle ages ( while they were dominant on the pyrenean ) . 
  they also got along with the jews quite well . 
  besides , most abrahamic religions have incredibly violent scriptures , but they do n't have to condition the behavior of their followers . 
  militant atheists and american creationists are the ones who do most of the literal interpreting anyway , and neither group is especially violent . 
  what ? 
  yeah , i wo n't , because i do n't see a point in it . 
  it 's meaningless . 
  in fact , i 've only ever read about tumblr when someone tried to attack general social justice concepts . 
  so i just expose people who do it as being full of it - tumblr is n't significant , no matter how many thousands of times you blame it for all our ills , but gay rights activists getting beaten up do . 
  it 's very ironic that you link me to a subreddit whose main purpose is to present a small group of spoiled brats as the representatives of people fighting for social justice . 
  people saying obnoxious things will never stop existing . 
  get over it . 
  they 're not important in any way . 
  i 've actually never even been to tumblr except when reading some technical article , so do n't pretend that those people are significant to anyone ... 
   the first group has done trememdous good in this world and has fought long and hard to gain equality for women , gays etc and the second group is a made-up caricature . 
  it does n't exist anywhere except in the minds of those who oppose social justice . 
  it 's basic propaganda : if you repeat something a 1000 times it becomes truth . 
  i mean , did n't you know that the perverted gay rights advocates are ruining the economy and are basically communists ? 
  you 're in sweden so you probably did n't , but in eastern europe / balkans - you can definitely feel the general sentiment , especially when gay rights advocates get beaten up to death in broad daylight and constitutions are getting rewritten left and right to exclude gays . 
  that 's just one example , you can see many others in certain subreddits like / r/worldnews . 
  nowadays you can see people being attacked for speaking about social justice and calling out racists - so much that people are afraid of being labeled ` social justice warriors ' . 
  but it 's all made up by extreme right groups . 
  their unambiguously articulated agenda is making racism , sexism , etc - the norm , so that they can push their political goals more freely . 
  i consider yugoslavia to have been quite successful , and communism * not * being the primary reason for the dissolution . 
  the main yugoslavian problems was that creating a south-slav nationality was a failed project and the internal national tensions brought about its end - not economic policy . 
  we could 've just as well split peacefully , in fact , there * were * peace talks , and ** many ** occasions that could 've stopped the fighting . 
  but the reasons the war was so destructive are very complicated and not at all related to communism . 
  yes , the war played a huge part . 
  it was terrible and very destructive , both socially and economically . 
  but it 's now been more than two decades and we 've experienced recovery after the war . 
  the current miserable situation is due to abysmal post-war politics and * badly done * privatization . 
  it was not in the interest of the people , the workers - who 've built this country during communism - but in the interest of about 200 rich families ( with prominent names being todorich and tedeschi , they 're getting international attention as well ) . 
  i 'm sure serbia and others have had their equivalents . 
  as i 've said before - i am not a communist . 
  i supported the national liberation movement and believed in a liberal ( classical european definition , not the us one ) democracy . 
  but the ruling parties have ruined our countries , destroyed our industries , sold off everything of value , and robbed us all - without any hyperbole . 
  my only argument is that communism is not automatically a spawn of hell - because it worked for a long time for us , all the while we were relatively free ( and ** much ** more prosperous ) , and without massacres like in the ussr - which are to be attributed to a ruthless dictatorship and centralization - not the defining elements of communism . 
  i 'm not sure what you 're trying to say . 
  the thing is - my only point is that communism is n't comparable to nazism at all . 
  these revisionists are actually saying it is * worse * - and honestly , that is quite frightening . 
  i 'm not arguing for communism , saying that it 's a better system - i 'm just trying to clear up their misconceptions . 
  i do not consider myself communist - but i lived in a communist regime and i know that it can be better than what they describe ( i.e. 
  no mass-killings , starvation , with freedom , etc ) . 
  the examples of mao and stalin regime were terrible , but not because of the idea of communism . 
  i lived under it . 
  i lived in yugoslavia , i still live in one of its constituent countries . 
  we were much more prosperous and , well , relevant , during communism . 
  and it was definitely not comparable to a nazi regime . 
  the reasons yugoslavia fell apart are complex and a totally different discussion . 
  they 're removed from wwii which happened half a century before the split . 
  regardless , nationalist struggles are hardly oppression on any level , compared to nazi or some communist crimes . 
  the partisans and yugoslav communists did not oppress . 
  again with the emotional arguments . 
  i do n't argue that these things did n't happen - i argue that their cause was not the political idea of communism , but rather absolute dictatorial power of a single person ( which is nothing marx originally envisioned ) , terrible policies ( embodied in mao 's cultural revolution and the greap leap forward ) , and my argument is strengthened also by the fact that yugoslavia was doing much better than it constituent countries are doing today , participated in liberating europe , never committed these atrocities , and its citizens were free to go and move wherever they wanted . 
  and i 'd say we were ** more ** communist than the ussr or mao 's china . 
  nazism on the other hand has extermination and genocide at its core . 
  the purpose , the intent , was power and destruction - which is not true of communism . 
   get your head out of your asshole , i 'm not disputing that the yugoslav partisans existed , i 'm disputing that they fought for `` freedom '' . 
  well then you 're factually wrong since they 've liberated our lands from the nazis who were slaughtering and using us as slaves . 
  they could 've been liberals for all i care but they did fight for freedom and every european should thank them . 
  your argument is based on emotion and not fact . 
  every army commits crimes , that 's why they 're called armies . 
  you 're from the usa - for example , so you should know quite well ( and yet i do n't go around screaming at you because of the crimes your military and secret services have committed in an attempt to draw an emotional reaction ) . 
  i do not deny that there is blood on the partisan 's hands ( for example - musolini 's - but of innocents as well ) . 
  i oppose equating of a liberating army - the partisans - who are the reason i am free today - with scum like nazis or stalinists . 
  communism is a political idea that is not connected to those deaths at all . 
  the deaths were cause primarily because of famine and poor conditions - you could argue that * those * were caused by poor ( communist ) policies , which is true - but to compare it to systematic extermination is incredibly dishonest . 
   communism was far worse than nazism in many aspects !, 
  i ca n't believe what i 'm reading . 
  this is like distilled historical revisionism . 
  communism as an idea is not in any way connected to the atrocities committed by those regimes . 
  yugoslavia was more communist than any of those and yet we were the most effective liberation and resistance movement in europe . 
  and the vast majority of those deaths were due to famine , and not systematic extermination . 
   sorry , tito 's partisans are part of the reason europe is free today ? 
  yes , they were literally [ the most effective resistance movement in europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans ) . 
  holy shit reddit is filled with historical revisionists . 
   is that why his yugoslavia dissolved so amicably , since everyone was so free ? 
  it fell apart because of nationalism . 
  and that is n't relevant to the resistance movement . 
  communism is not comparable to nazism . 
  communists such as tito 's partisans are one of the reasons why europe is free today . 
  if someone is starting this - ping me , i can code, 
  you only get freedom if you 're rich enough to afford it . 
  hehe , just kidding ,
