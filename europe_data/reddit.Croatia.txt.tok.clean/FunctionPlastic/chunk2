  good , good * counting clueless tourist money *, 
   you have a lovely land . 
  thanks . 
   halfway between slavic and italian right ? 
  bibbity bobbity , pizza , comrade , da . 
   you were very competent militarily in the breakup of yugoslavia . 
  t-thanks , nato . 
  you what m8, 
  undoubtedly so , sir . 
  * tightens tie and continues scribbling with [ pencil ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavoljub_eduard_penkala ) *, 
  i came here to protest that zagreb is n't a more important intersection . 
  it should be , since croatia connects the mediterranean , ce , and se !, 
  well given that our countries ( croatia , serbia , bih ) have very recently suffered a devastating bloody war because of nationalistic ambitions , yes , i care about great serbia , which is along with great croatia , mind you - the embodiment of nationalism . 
  i could n't give a shit about russia , sorry . 
  oh man that 's fucked up . 
   no same sex marriage we actually managed to pull a fast one on that and introduce civil unions which cover everything except adoption . 
  basically the entire right wing is absolutely furious because now gays have almost the exact same rights as everyone else , and that would 've never happened if not for them !, 
  thanks for the tip , we 're working on it . 
  cementing everything we can asap , of course . 
  oh man , i always have sympathy for us poor , oppressed , white straight males . 
  when will all these `` women '' , `` gays '' , and `` brown people '' finally stop taking our rights away and colonizing our land ?!, 
  oh the things i have to endure from this left wing dictatorship !, 
   velika srbija man i wonder why anyone would be serbophobic around here, 
  croatian here . 
  i doubt anyone even knows we exist . 
  seriously , how * do * you perceive us ? 
  edit : apparently our tourist propaganda bureau is quite efficient . 
  yes , you mindless drones , come spend your cash in droves , muahahah !, 
  jk , i do really like my country 's landscape and attractions . 
  it 's great because there 's so much geographical variety . 
  do come here . 
  what 's interesting in that ? 
  did n't it happen like 200 years ago with benjamin disraeli ? 
  so there 's some extremist organization that claims to be leftist and attacks tourists and sends bullets . 
  quite strange i 'd say , and distasteful . 
  meanwhile , some time a go a right-wing extremist killed like 70 children and other people . 
  neo-nazi gangs that perform executions * are an actual thing * , while this is the first time i hear about `` leftist extremists '' outside the context of universities and smug students . 
  lets not even talk about all the other right wing extremism in europe , like raiding of roma villages in hungary , or leftist poets - uh i mean violent lingo-terrorists - get executed in greece in broad daylight . 
  oh and there are countries in which extreme right parties form a very strong portion of parliaments , and go on to suggest that jews should be ` on a list ' and protest the world jewish congress . 
  your claim that someone is trying to make the right wing extremists look bad in comparison to leftist ones is completely out of touch is reality . 
  they already look worse than any obscure group of `` leftist extremists '' you take , and actually form a very strong political platform in europe right now . 
  ah the old leftist conspiracy to destroy us all . 
  you people sound ridiculous . 
  have you even read any of it ? 
  like , \u010cehov , or dostojevski , or tolstoy ? 
  they deal with intellectuals and citizenry , not the peasantry ( although they do touch upon the city-village relationship like many other realists ), 
  i do n't want to support a system which relies on intellectual property and locking down of knowledge ( plants ' genomes in this case ) . 
  if the research behind these products was scientific - that is , available to all - then i would most likely support it . 
  i try to live by these principles when it comes to software , i 'll live by then when it comes to plants much quicker . 
  oh , yeah , totally . 
  i get the freedom to say ` fuck the serbs ' or something while todori\u0107 gets the freedom to own croatia ( and now slovenia ) neat arrangement totally worth giving up the country for 10/10 would go to war for again, 
  such beauty i also like giant factories , especially if they look all rugged and stuff however since capitalism was introduced we lost all our factories haha, 
  i was saying that i * liked * communist/socialist architecture . 
  i honestly prefer socialist architecture ... 
  i feel so out of place when i visit places like the us which have none ( and have even bigger differences from europe like no squares ) . 
  probably because i grew up surrounded by it . 
   i 'd rather have another war * unlocks pi\u0161tolj *, 
  same with communism , except much more frequent in eastern europe . 
  i really want to show that to a friend of mine !, 
  he 's not even * from * the uk but he likes ukip because nationalism ( ? ), 
  and `` eu bad '' . 
   it 's closer to `` fucking deluded '' . 
  i 'd say * intentionally misled * is much more accurate . 
  the middle one in bosnia is the center of one of the greatest yugoslav works of literature - [ na drini \u0106uprija ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_bridge_on_the_drina ) ( the bridge on the drina ) by [ ivo andri\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivo_andri%c4%87 ) ( a serbian/croatian writer ) , for which he was awarded the nobel prize . 
  the novel spans about 500 years and shows how amazing historical events are related to the bridge , how it brings people together , i really recommend you get a version on your language / english and read it !, 
   oh , no luxury house , no luxury food , no free money ? 
  you can not seriously believe this . 
  glorious !, 
  we have twice as many as serbia !, 
  they lied to us, 
  this makes so little sense, 
  yeah that game is inspired by slavic mythology right ? 
  glagoljica was probably used by non-croat slavs at some point as well . 
  it 's a spectrum but pretty much every country is capitalist with varying degrees of state intervention . 
  private ownership of the means of production = capitalism, 
  this seems like an incredible waste of resources . 
  none of that addresses what i said . 
  so the next time you 're wondering how hitler was elected , just remember this comment and 100 more like it every day . 
  your body is constantly battling various infections , and low temperatures mean less energy is devoted to the immune system . 
  sorry to burst the contrarian circlejerk . 
   a real champion of humanism , free speech and democracy yeah stalin was not a liberal and no one pretends he was . 
  this is a strawman purely of your own making . 
  nope . 
  was the main reason nazis were defeated . 
  stop relativizing history . 
  this is bullshit . 
  the mrp is not some kind of buddies ' declaration . 
  the ussr was trying to get western powers to realize the danger of nazi germany and attack * for years * before that pact was introduced . 
  ussr has the moral high ground in the context of ww2 . 
   according to statistics however austria ranks at about place 3 worldwide in safety . 
  outraging , right ? 
  they 're willing to go as far as to fake these statistics to keep destroying the west !!, 
  mzt is a rather fringe line that is quite deviate from accepted mlm theories though . 
  you can find crazies in almost any movement . 
  great opinion man 8/b8 would downvote again, 
  [ maosim ] ( http://massalijn.nl/theory/marxism-leninism-maoism-basic-course/#chapter5 ) , shorthand for marxism-leninism-maoism , is an extension of ml . 
  ( legit ) marxist-leninists are n't idealists , they 're the exact opposite . 
  and i said it could n't . 
  because it 's not possible . 
  i wish i bookmarked an article by a historian explaining how legitimate revisionism happens all the time in academia , where they refine their knowledge of the death toll , causes , etc. , and that 's a completely accepted practice .
