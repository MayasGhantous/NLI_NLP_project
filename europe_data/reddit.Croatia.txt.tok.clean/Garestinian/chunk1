in croatia pale lagers rarely have below 4 % , most commonly 4.5-5 % . 
  in bars/pubs they usually cost # 1-1 .2 ( half a litre ) . 
  most dark lagers are stronger , upwards to 8 % . 
  more expensive/rare brands only sold in pubs are around # 2 or even more . 
  what is the average abv of beers most commonly sold ? 
  yup . 
  male : zlatan , zlatko female : zlata , zlatka , zlatica common se slavic names . 
  yup , spring or autumn . 
  in spring everything is blooming , in autumn you have nice colours . 
  summer is the most boring of seasons , imo . 
  [ autumn ] ( http://www.putopis.hr/galerija/plitvice%20jesen/plitvice-jesen1.jpg ), 
  i should 've been more clear . 
  i have nothing against translations , but they should n't be done word-by-word . 
  it 's usually best to translate the gist of the lyrics , while making the meter work . 
  for example , croatian translation of `` ode to joy '' is quite close to the original ( not in all lines ) , but still makes the best use of poetics in croatian language . 
  it 's quite well done , in my opinion . 
  but what 's wrong with original german text ? 
  why translate everything ? 
  these people are the lucky ones who have the monies to go to yurop . 
  several millions of ( poorer ) refugees are stuck in turkey and lebanon and will never have the chance to go to sweet sweet germoney . 
  taking only those refugees in is a non-solution and very hypocritical . 
  i agree totally with you on that , europe is a mess right now . 
  you ca n't have open borders and not a common immigration policy at the same time . 
  oh come on ... 
  yes , there is an end in sight , but these people need to be processed . 
  yes , most of them are refugees , but some might be pure economic migrants , or even worse - isis terrorists . 
  now , i do n't think us would treat issue of potential terrorists entering country lightly . 
  the only difference is in types of drinks ... nothern cultures drink more hard liqour , mediterranean ones drink more wine ( which makes sense because it 's hard to produce wine in scandinavia ) . 
  exactly . 
  croatia has 44-47 % , not 34 % as stated in the graph . 
  source ( national forest service ) : http://portal.hrsume.hr/index.php/en/forests/general/forests-in-croatia  total area of forests and forest land in croatia amounts to 2 , 688 . 
  687 ha which is 47 % of its total land area . 
  out of that , 2 , 106 . 
  917 ha is state-owned , whereas 581 770 ha are privately owned . 
  vast majority of state-owned forests is managed by hrvatske \u0161ume ( 2 , 018.987 ha ) . 
  this source : https://www.cbd.int/countries/profile/default.shtml?country=hr ( soruce for wikipedia ) says 44 % , which is similar to forest service data . 
  but even more importantly , croatia has a region of dense contiguous forests with thriving wolf , bear and lynx population . 
  interesting , forests in croatia have gone up few percentage points since the 90 's . 
  croatian coast is a lot bigger than mallorca . 
  i 'm sure you can find lots of places without much annoying tourists . 
  and st. marko church is not a cathedral . 
  but is n't he elected through parliament ? 
  no , it 's not presidential just because prime minister has `` president '' in the title . 
  spain is parliamentary monarchy . 
  usa is prime example of presidential system . 
  and then brits blew half of it away . 
  yeah , the problem is i have a really large display , and therefore only a top part of the picture was visible ( it sort of `` zooms '' the picture in if you make your browser window larger ) , making it a lot harder to recognize . 
  i first thought ... pfft , of course it 's always italy for the first banner , i wonder when will be croatia 's turn ... then i looked at the picture a bit better ... 
  and it 's purely natural !, 
  unless they want to drive it to a special destination ... ahem , 9/11 , ahem . 
  original is by nena only . 
  90 's remake in half-english is with kim wilde . 
  i ca n't decide which version is better , both are great . 
  similar in croatia : * nisam toliko bogat da kupujem jeftino * ( i 'm not that rich to buy cheap ), 
  we could build a gibraltar dam, 
  you are thinking of venice , italy, 
  if i 'm speaking shtokavian ( on which croatian and serbian standards are based ) . 
  my native kajkavian ( which should be classified as a separate language imo ) ? 
  not so much . 
  except for \u010cakavian and kajkavian . 
  it 's * svetlo * in kajkavian . 
  chakavian is * svitlo * . 
  ( actually it 's a question of ekavian/ikavian/ijekavian `` jat '' reflex ), 
  interesting . 
  croatia is having more rainwater than ever . 
  it 's definitely getting hotter , but also more wet . 
  in slovenian they say * rde\u010da * for red and * rumena * for yellow ( which confuses me a lot , because in croatian `` rumen '' means `` of reddish/pinkish colour '' ) . 
  in croatian * stol * is a table , and * stolica/stolac * is a chair or stool ( * stolec * in kajkavian ) . 
  * stoli\u0107 * is a little table ( * stolek * in kajkavian ) , and * stol\u010di\u0107 * is a little chair ( * stol\u010dek * in kajkavian ) . 
  yes , choose shtokavian because sleazing with the serbs / / just my opinion i accept standard croatian shtokavian as croatian official language , but i will never accept that kajkavian is a `` dialect '' of this language . 
  kajkavian is a language spoken by croatians , as is chakavian or shtokavian . 
  but that does n't mean it 's a dialect of `` croatian language '' ( that does n't really exist ) . 
  deal with it . 
  yeah , linguistics is totes `` science '' . 
  that 's like , your opinion , man . 
  first learn english properly , then we can discuss about what 's croatian and what is n't . 
  and the language is n't croatian , it 's a dialect of serbian !, 
   but in northern part it takes same strmoglavil form . 
  that 's no croatian , it 's kajkavian !, 
  yes , that 's it , not hou\u0161t\u00ed ( gusti\u0161 , which comes from gust ( dense ) ) . 
  my mistake . 
  interestingly , `` dub '' is now archaic in croatian , for oak we use another old-slavic word instead - hrast ( ~ ~ hou\u0161t\u00ed ~ ~ chr\u00e1st ) . 
  '' \u0160uma '' comes from '' \u0161um '' ( white noise ) , a sound leaves make on windy days . 
  '' \u0160um '' is , of course , onomatopoeic word . 
  another ( archaic ) word is `` dubrava '' , from old-slavic `` dub '' ( oak ) . 
  this word is still present in many toponyms , including dubrovnik . 
  [ checks out ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/croatia_topo.jpg ), 
  but how on earth is iceland bigger ? 
  is every icelander a redditor ? 
  and croatians in ireland !, 
  no , we move to ireland instead . 
  just look at their spectrographs . 
  [ white led spectrum ] ( http://openluna.org/wiki/images/6/63/warm_vs_cool_white.jpg ) : see that blue ( near uv ) spike ? 
  that 's very bad for nightlife ( and humans who are sleeping at night ) as it makes our brains think it 's daytime , makes us awake and messes with our internal clock . 
  [ hps spectrum ] ( http://www.hidhut.com/images/600hps%20lamp.jpg ) : much better , almost no blue light makes it great for nighttime as it does n't awaken us as much . 
  but still provides good visibility and colour . 
  lps lamps pollute the least ( only two narrow wavelengths of yellow ) and are efficient because our eyes are most sensitive at [ yellow-greens ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/eyesensitivity.svg/669px-eyesensitivity.svg.png ) . 
  but are too much of a tradeoff because everything appears in shades of yellow , discerning colors is nearly impossible . 
  led 's pollute more than hps lamps shown in the picture . 
  and therefore i wash hands before i hold my winkie .
