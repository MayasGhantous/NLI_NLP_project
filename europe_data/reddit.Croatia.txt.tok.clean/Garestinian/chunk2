  no , i want these : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/img_8248_leipzig_hbf.jpg and i believe those are lcd-s . 
  but abortion also has no effect on life of pro-lifers . 
  interesting that my country ( croatia ) is still pro-abortion even though it is now ( at least declaratively ) very catholic . 
  and same for all other ex-yugoslavian countries . 
  i 'm talking about signs that display train departure/arrival info . 
  i wish we had something like what you in germany have . 
  ( lcd signs for a start , instead of shitty led ones ), 
  it 's not only the radius that 's important , but also superelevation ( cant ) of a track in a curve that cancels out centrifugal forces ( directs them to the ground ) . 
  radius + superelevation = design speed . 
  of course , there is a safety factor , but anything 20-30 km/h over design speed is a gamble . 
  yup , i agree . 
  quite strange . 
  yup , forgot to mention that it was sharp for hsl . 
  yup , there is a sharp curve . 
  probably the safety systems were shut off because of testing , or malfunctioned . 
  it 's very unlikely that all the breaking systems failed . 
  you know one is a master of english pronounciation if tree/three/free all sound different . 
  i swear my condo tower was shaking for at least 10 seconds . 
  it was definitely felt in zagreb , croatia on higher floors . 
  more of a swaying than shaking . 
  it was felt even here in zagreb , croatia . 
  nice swaying on the 8th floor . 
  actually , it 's marten ( [ coat of arms of slavonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coat_of_arms_of_croatia ) ), 
  mostly bih and dalmatian hinterland . 
  there 's bullfighting in dalmatia ( regions near bih ) too !, 
  a recent popular croatian romantic comedy [ `` sonja i bik '' ( sonja and the bull ) ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2249542/ ) revolves around love between a guy who has a bullfighting bull and an animal-rights activist . 
  well , the grandma thing kinda happened here in zagreb . 
  doors on new trams have rubber around them , and if you insert cane it wo n't signal that the door is n't fully closed . 
  there is nothing wrong regarding height of the platform in relation to trains . 
  the fuck-up is not adjusting for entrances to the ( lower ) station building . 
  probably a case of `` not my job '' . 
  til ... was n't that a federal law ? 
  how ? 
  the old greeks were philosophers , the new greeks are putting it into practice . 
  napoleon was 1.68 m. 
  that was taller than average at the time . 
  yes , about half : http://www.norskolje.museum.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/3266_ee988172a7e14799adccfc973143b96b.jpg ( more than a half in terms of weight ) the bottom-half is submerged in the op 's picture . 
  there is no picture where the full height is visible , because they submerged the bottom half before building the top half . 
  i especially like the contrast of raw concrete , greenery and blue sky . 
  and clean shapes and volumes . 
  admiration of brutalism is definitely something of an acquired taste . 
  kettles draw power in range of 1000-3000 w. water is a hard substance to heat ( more than 4000 jules needed to raise 1 kg of water by 1 kelvin ) . 
  let 's say you want to bring 1 litre of water ( approx . 
  1kg ) from room temp ( 20 c ) to boil . 
  you need 4185 j * 80 = 335 kj of energy . 
  that 's 93 watt/hours of energy . 
  that is , a heater with power of 93 watts will need one hour to boil the water . 
  if you want it done in one minute , you need your heater to have power of 89 * 60 = 5580 watts !, 
  pc power supplies can nowadays be rated as high as 1000w or more , but on average computer draws 50-150 w ( unless you are crunching numbers at 100 % the whole time ) . 
  fortunately , austrians are keeping their country bear-free by shooting every bear from croatia and slovenia that dares to cross the border . 
  / s proud to be a citizen of a country where bear , wolf and lynx are protected and thriving . 
  nothing wrong , we have almost shared some of our own vast wealth . 
  to be the only non-western eu country that was a net giver , that would 've been something / s, 
  drvoaluminijski are the most expensive type of window . 
  wood inside , aluminium outside . 
  continental croatia is culturally close to austria . 
  coastal region should be under `` southern europe '' . 
  yup, 
   seems really nice and futuristic how about eyugo ? 
  or iyugo ? 
  the dot denotes that the result is a float ( or a double ) , not an integer . 
  when you divide int by a float you get a float . 
  so the same thing as in croatia : '' \u017eivotno partnerstvo '' . 
  but almost anyone is unoficially calling it `` brak '' ( marriage ) . 
  but 50 % of generating capacity belongs to croatia , that 's the whole point . 
  slovenia ca n't count on that capacity as it ca n't regulate it . 
  this is an agreement between republic of slovenia and republic of croatia , and is much stronger than owning some shares . 
  you do n't have a nuclear share of 50 % , only 25 % . 
  no , you do n't uderstand . 
  slovenia is not exporting power to croatia , it 's croatia 's power all along because croatia owns half of the plant , half of the staff is croatian , croatia will need to take care of half of the waste etc. 
  it was built as a joint venture between sr slovenia and sr croatia . 
  kr\u0161ko is closer to zagreb than it is to ljubljana , and it 's directly connected to croatian grid with 2x400 kv power line . 
  we are obliged to take it when kr\u0161ko will be decomissioned ( or pay someone else for disposal and storage ) . 
  as of now , all the waste is still stored at kr\u0161ko . 
   but a new plant is about to be built . 
  again with russian technology . 
  i 'm not saying that 's bad though . 
  as long as it 's not rbmk ... 
  you are missing croatia . 
  kr\u0161ko plant is 50/50 co-owned by slovenia and croatia . 
  half of the energy goes to croatia . 
  not only reddit maniacs , forum.hr is one of the biggest forums on the internet . 
  so is good to know cyrillic . 
  you do n't need to learn it , of course ( like you do n't need to do anything at all in life other than die ) . 
  but it does n't hurt if you know it . 
  to be able to read cyrillic , duh . 
  why have you learned english if you could live without knowing it ? 
  and transliteration ( or learning a latin/cyrillic alphabet ) is a very complicated process . 
  for the record , half of the stuff in serbia is written in latin alphabet . 
  incorrect . 
  geographical centre of croatia is in bosnia . 
  so bih is the closest foreign country in all directions !, 
  if you consider straight lines from the coast , you could hit montenegro , albania and libya from prevlaka and greece from punta planka ( and from many islands ) . 
  and of course , slovenija from savudrija . 
  edit : ** and even egypt from medulin !, 
  ** there is a straight line from medulin to egypt , not crossing over any land !, 
  ( if my google earth line tool is correct . 
  distance : 1779 km . 
  i 'd say 1/3 of gulf of piran and no military shenanigans in `` junction '' area . 
  deal .
