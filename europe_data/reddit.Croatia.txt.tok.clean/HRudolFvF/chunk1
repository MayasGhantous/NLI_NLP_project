we are waiting for your complete rehabilitation of dra\u017ea mihailovi\u0107 and nedi\u0107 , and then is our turn ... 
  just 2 things : 1 . 
  so do n't teach us about collaboration with hitler ... 2 . 
  chetnics and nedi\u0107 cooperated with ndh , especially nedi\u0107 on * project emigration * of serbs from ndh . 
  first tell our far right wing parties that croats are slavs , not goths . 
  `` only fool laugh of everything . '', 
  ffs , who finds hebdo 's work funny ? 
  so did far-right . 
  always knew that communists and fascists have much in common . 
  ou yes ... 
  there is a big difference between vu\u010di\u0107 and his buddies in thirdyugoslava and them now . 
  sorry , completety forgot about that ... 
  neither unesco ... 
  but like i said , serbia for rsk situation ( and it 's police and military forces ) had pretty different opinion . 
  ** just noticing . 
  i 'm not saying who is right and who is not . 
  kosovo is recognised by half of world ( not from most of the states who have their own problems with secessionist regions ) unlike rsk ( which even russia did n't recognise ) , but i do n't recall that you had that political stance back then . 
  balkans . 
  the only place in the world where the leaders before the start negotiate how to wage war . 
  * god * , what we have done wrong to you ... 
  another serbian nationalist ** disguised ** with eu flair . 
  montenegro is multiethnic state ? 
  ** checkmate . 
  i 'm just replying . 
  not all croats are * antiserb * from birth . 
  btw . 
  are serbs on kosovo in danger ? 
  how much interethnic intolerance is there ? 
  are there parts of kosovo in which serbs definitely ca n't go or will be attacked ? 
  and here * apologies * were mocked by most of the croats and croatian media . 
  not welcomed with enthusiasm . 
  and croats initiated escalation of the tensions in croatia . 
  and muslims in bih . 
  * poor * serbia . 
  just dont ... beacause of minority in croatia like you , lot of people draw equal sign between croats and fascists . 
  you are not helping your country by doing this . 
  nah ... we were just watching how our president was digging her own political grave . 
  it was unlaughable . 
  who leads in presidential polls ? 
  i know . 
   i was a little bit sarcastic . 
  but the fact is that they ( even on national television ) prays you as allies and someone who is always on their side . 
  that is always rightfull one , ofc . 
  when greek , serbian `` ortodox brother '' , says that it must hear serbian hart . 
  diplomacy saves lifes . 
  war takes it . 
  and only one spark is enough ... 
  both croatia and ukraine know that very well . 
  we need more talk , more diplomacy with russia . 
  war is n't so romantic like in movies or exciting like in wot , dod , moh . 
  by surnames ( last name ) . 
  also , language is slightly different and accent . 
  nothing more then funny looks or some light insults from individuals . 
  nothing more then than . 
  on croatian thread minority of replies are from serbs and most of them said `` yes , but not in some extreme scenarios '' . 
  on serbian thread there only 1 real reply . 
  in all others they are either calling me bad names or `` explaining me '' how my country is pathologicly obsessed with hate against serbia throughout centuries , which is quite interesting because i did n't aks them that and maybe we can use psychiatric metod of projection in that case ( `` i do n't hate you , you hate me '' problems ) . 
  or maybe discriminated against , disadvantaged in some ways compared to croats ? 
  how do you see minor fascist elements in croatian society ? 
  have you ever felt afraid or ashamed because of yours nationality ? 
  `` halo '' or `` molim '' ( please ) . 
  in istria some people use italian word `` pronto '' . 
  not us . 
  we just got here ( after 15 years of strugle ) !, 
  in percentage , how many people vote ( from number of them who have right to vote ) ? 
  same in ** croatia ** . 
  but what is the difference between a nationalist and `` regular '' patriot ? 
  do n't you think that lot of todays nationalists trough spreading love and proud on their own origin , openly reduce the value of origin and culture of other nations ( * national minorities * ) in their own country ? 
  then how to make difference between nationalist and fascist ? 
  & nbsp ; for me term * nationalist * has bad connotation . 
  for example , in croatia : here they constant rise in the heavens , our culture and language . 
  and if someone opose to them ? 
  he is a ** serb ** . 
  so , serb is an insult . 
  being a serb in croatia makes you less valuable ? 
  very similar thing is in serbia , just oposite ( ofc ) . 
  not to mention other countries ... slovenia , hungary , albania . 
  greece and it 's `` new dawn '' party . 
  are they fascists or nationalists ? 
  ** to my country ... ** balkans mentality itself and serbia encouraged with russian pat on the back . 
  i do n't say that serbs are our threat but politics is bitch . 
  ** europe . 
  ** brexit and growth of antieu movements ; terrorism . 
  ** world . 
  ok , but lot of today 's european nationalists openly spread xenophobia and flirt with fascism , but still does n't want to be compared with it . 
  `` i love my own , not hate other 's '' they like to say , buy is it like that ... ? 
  marija is the most popular name in croatia . 
  for decades . 
  and all in same neighborhood ... ? 
  and holding white persian cat in lap ? 
  yes , they counquered it for venice . 
  before that it was croatian . 
  i meant `` smart '' in a way that they can see what is good and what 's not so good . 
  did n't put in question his inteligence . 
  i think in croatia schools teaches quite negative about crusaders . 
  robbers , murderers and rapist . 
  even helped venice to conquer one of our towns : zadar . 
  so no , nothing romantic about them . 
  glad to see that all of this accounts are ( were ) downvotes magnets . 
  there are still normal and smart people ...
