  very beautiful . 
  beautiful nature , hills and mountains , woods , lakes . 
  did n't met lot of slovenians , but those who are know are ok people and the girls are very pretty . 
  most western , advanced and most organized country from all other exyu countries definitely . 
  deadliest : & nbsp ; [ crna udovica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/latrodectus_tredecimguttatus ) [ sme\u0111i pauk samotnjak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mediterranean_recluse_spider ), 
  how does slovenia see croats ? 
  i did n't mean to offend you . 
  someone on / r/croatia called him that , after his constant insults , and i picked it up . 
  what does it truly means ? 
   tigr one more fact that all croats were n't fascist butchers , like your countryman '' \u010defur '' says . 
   monts after the uprising in slovenia . 
  on the 27 . . aptil 1941 the antiimperial front was founded it was a meeting . 
  `` sastanak '' we would say . 
  not armed rebellion . 
  now i even checked on wiki , just to be 100 % , and even serbian wikipedia says that it was 1st armed antifa rebellion . 
  or now you wan na say that croats took over serbian wikipedia too ... ? 
   your croatian propaganda does not let you see past your own borders ro k ow who was truly first to resist the german beast . 
  wrong again . 
  todays cro medias avoid to talk about antifa and partisans . 
  it 's taboo topic . 
  sadly . 
   and while you and your paveli\u0107 were licking their boots we were fighting . . said by you ... ** more than 250 thousand croats fought in nob . 
  ** some of them were my ancestors and i am proud on them . 
  unfortunately there is minority who wants to minimize it 's achievements , but `` pucanj u prazno '' we would say on balkans . 
  nob , croatian nob , and nov will not be forgotten . 
   and than croatia proceded slaughtering thousands of inocents while not alowing the displaced to return to this day . . ok , give me examples ? 
  examples of systematic killing of serbs ? 
   i was talking about today . 
  how they would rule . . you first bring up words `` rf and prc have vetos '' . 
  and just before that `` unsc would rule against croatia if it went to them '' . 
  ( your train of thought is difficult to track ; even for you ) . 
  so why they did not consider this case ? 
  if its `` cleansing '' ? 
  they ruled on bunch of other genocides . 
  usa would rule against it 's own 90 's politics ? 
  ofc , probably you do not admit right to usa on veto ; only china and russia counts . 
  third reich and italy ** < ** slavko kvaternik ? 
  seriously ? 
  this debate is coming to it 's end . 
  where to start ? 
  & nbsp ; my opinion is that croatia is full of scandals , but most of the time people do n't realise it . 
  last example : for last christmas croatian president shared boxes of sweets ( most of them made in croatia ) to children . 
  few days after that someone ( maybe parents ; idk for sure ) noticed that 1 chocolate bar in box is made in serbia . 
  our president gave official apology to those children and their parents for that . 
  i mean , so what ? 
  ** it 's fuckin chocolate bar !, 
  ** people in serbia buy croatian products . 
  we in croatia buy serbian products . 
  personally i am huge fan of theirs `` smoki '' , for which i think is the best of its kind on croatian market , and `` pionir '' sweets , who has very good mentol candy which is good for winters and cough . 
  ofc , after that official serbia responded and our president grabar-kitarovi\u0107 , continued to dig herself up more and more . 
  there are also more other examples . 
  ** the biggest ** was probably when hdz party ( croatian democratic union ) and it 's officials ( including former prime minister dr. sanader ) were charged for corruption and stealing hundreds of millions of kunas . 
   makinga country of someone elses land is takong it 's not invading ... and i ask you again : who created ndh ? 
  sure was n't ustashe . 
   tell me the date , surely you know . 
  as a communist you should knew that already ... prvi partizanski odred , 22.06.1941 . 
  in woods of brezovica , near sisak . 
  little less than 100 partisans . 
  not sure how much of them survived war ( i can check that in books , if you want ) but my relative was one of the luckiest who did . 
  after that other partisan units started to creating . 
  that was the 1st antifascist partisan unit in the croatia and yugoslavia . 
  you can hate , you can mock and offend , but you can not change that truth . 
  member of that unit was also one of the highest ranking generals in modern day republic of croatia . 
   germany not in the swcurety council also you forget china and russia have veto . 
  my bad , i mixed up toughts . 
  all international intelligence agencies knew for military operation `` oluja '' . 
  they all knew were notified or knew by themself . 
  before `` oluja '' , in july , tu\u0111man issued an ultimatum to the serbian authorities in knin : beginning of serious negotiations on the opening of the railway zagreb-knin-split , stopping the the serbian advance on biha\u010d , beginning of serious negotiations on the return of the krajina under the control of croatian . 
  even before that , `` plan z4 '' was proposed to rsk . 
  serbs could have their own state in our state , full autonomy . 
  croatia did n't like it , but un and the world wanted that plan to pass , so it was on the table . 
  knin declined both propositions . 
  after all that croatia had usa and german support ( not sure for uk ) for military solution and operation started . 
  days before start , serbs knew for it . 
  they anounced it on their television . 
  rsk highest ranking officials sent their familys to serbia . 
  lot of ordinary people started to flee . 
  rsk 's soldiers were fleeing . 
  where `` etni\u010dko \u010di\u0161\u0107enje '' in that ? 
  also serbia ( or sr yugoslavia ) did n't do shit for krajina and those serbs . 
  ** nothing . 
  ** veto for what ? 
  aproving our operation ? 
  did n't know that unsc needs to aprove everys countries military operation ... come on , be smart . 
  and do n't mix up todays russia and china , and then ? 
  russia had their own serious problems and china did n't care a thing about situatian on balkans ( also was much less stronger than today ) . 
  the most important thing is : rsk was not internationally recognized . 
  not * even * from russia or china, 
  i believe most croats would say aleksandar i. kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 . 
  but from my side of view it 's debatable . 
   do even know definition of tension ? 
  you really like those small flags . 
  answer me first , what 's your definition of tension , and than i will answer your question . 
   they took `` took '' or was implanted in ndh by it 's creators ? 
  be reasonable ... ndh did n't invade any countries you claim . 
  reich would not allow it . 
   that is wrong . . what date did the so called croatian resistance start ? 
  before that one in slovenia , thats for sure . 
   never ruled on it . 
  if it went to the securety council they surely will not rule in croatias favor .
