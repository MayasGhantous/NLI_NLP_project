  1 . there is no t of tensions . 
  are borders are final . 
  much less then rs presure for secession and uniting with serbia . 
  also , rs is supporting croats to create new entity , but our politicians are n't sure is that a good idea . 
  wtf ? 
  those were regular , ordinary police for carrying only pistols , badly guided from ministry of internal affairs . 
  they were disarmed and kindly sent back home . 
  were are you taking all those wrong informations ? 
  from krajinaforce or dnevno.rs kinds of sites . 
  please , be reasonable and read what are you talking/writing . 
  ** edit : ** can you see that your comments are magnets for bad karma ? 
  does n't that ring you any bell ? 
  maybe that you have completely wrong and narrow-minded view ? 
  ofc . 
  any scientific proofs to back up this theory ? 
  i think that will be one of the most peaceful territory sell in the world . 
  we will just continue working in tourism , chilling during winters and our territorial ( and teran ) dispute will automatically vanish . 
  ou ... , our man . 
  from which part of croatia is he ? 
  do you know to play some instrument like guitar and sing ? 
  that would be easiest way to earn money , belive me . 
  and the least illegal way to earn money . 
  gig ? 
  it depends what do you want ? 
  antic history , nature , sea adventure , water park amusement or just chill by the sea ... 
  most of people knows english very well , people are friendly ( we are western , most liberal part of country ) , prices are lower then in greece , spain or italy . 
  we use kunas which you can buy across all of the country . 
  crime ratings are low and also cops from other countries come to work in out region during summer together with our police because of lot of foreign tourists , so they can feel as home . 
  istrias 's history legacy is very rich and you can enjoy in the world 's second most preserved roman amphitheater in pula , old city of pore\u010d , smallest city on the world hum and other antics remains . 
  we have waterparks , beautiful nature , boat trips , few islands , and even safari animals on islands called brijuni . 
  what do you want to see/enjoy in during holiday ? 
  if you have any type of questions feel free to ask . 
  i can tell you for croatia . 
  language is barrier because croatian is foundation for every job , every team work . 
  you know only english or ? 
  also it depends which skills you possess . 
  in the summer most of the jobs you can find are in tourism . 
  and ofc , i presume that you will work `` on black '' which means without permit ... ? 
  only one foreign language . 
  mostly english and german ; italian by the coast . 
  but most schools are enforcing students to learn at least 2 foreign languages , so in a few years hopefully situation will change on better . 
  spanish and russian are more and more popular as secondary foreign languages . 
  which countries ? 
  and what 's your education if i may ask ? 
  and were you ever been in croatia ; in which regions ? 
   erm his actions and doctrine . . eli5 .

  please try to use more accurate english . 
  i do n't have degree in cryptography . 
  i am talking about timeline after fall of kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  also , how can we be occupiers in our own countriy ? 
  i said `` occupying forces '' ( third reich , italy ) `` and it 's servents '' ( ustashe , chetnicks ) . 
  comunist party of croatia lifted uprise not only before slovenian cp , but first on in whole yugoslavia . 
  check dates if you ca n't belive it . 
   exactly , not in italy or german ocupied lands , but in the croatian state ofc , on croatian teritory ( and thank you for recognizing efforts of croatian communists ) , that 's my point , but it was puppet state divided on german and italian interest zones with theirs constant military presents . 
  do i need to include crayons and drawings in my answers ? 
   ndh invades slovenia serbia and bosnia . 
  do you hear yourself ? 
  slovenia was part of third reich . 
  how could ndh attacked it ? 
  serbia was under direct control of reich with so weak state army which was affraid to leave cities were was stationed . 
  how could ndh attacked it ? 
  and with who to fight ? 
  bosnia was automaticly included in ndh by german and italian creators . 
  do you really think that ustashe had any influence on that decision ? 
  please do n't give them that credits . 
  their today follower will be proud . 
   noone mentioned rsk the fact remained you genocidal manoaxs desplaced thousanda from the krajina area and refuze to alowe them to retuen you do realize that rsk is official name ( or it was ) for krajina ? 
  nobody is denying them right to return . 
  croatian goverments even rebuilds theirs houses but the fact remains that those regions are empty ( croats left in begining of war , serbs at the end ) and the poverty is high . 
  where to return ? 
   local selfmanagment socialism was much better than this fewdal system we have now tested where ? 
  in yugoslavia ?

  teachers insistin in discriminationg minorety students . 
  the constant opression the city of vukovar has faced from the croation owerlords ... 
  conducted by extreme-right politicians , war veterans and peoples who lost a lot in war . 
  not justified act but understandable . 
  with incapable goverment who was affraid to do something about it . 
  teachers discriminates students ? 
  opression of city vukovar ? 
  never heard for it . 
   why did the police not beat them into a blody pulpe ? 
  because modern society does n't work like that . 
   where are the reoarations ? 
  on paper , yes . 
  just like german conc.camps were beautifull paradise on red cross videos . 
   `` za dom spremi '' at the glorification of the oluja genocide when i said ** us ** , i meant people mentioned in my last reply . 
  do ** not ** put me in same bascet with fascists . 
  and again ... was used by minority . 
  neither politicians , neither our armed forces or police used that battlecry . 
   no shit . 
  who wouldnt hate murderers , rapists , teafs , genocidal maniacs , nazis ... 
  same things that western europe says about all balkans . 
  and yes , for slovenia too , do not kid yourself . 
  you are imbued by hate and i feel sorry for you . 
  it takes a lot of energy . 
  `` he who hates , shining calls new evils '' .
