  i too would have plenty of reasons to hate serbs but i do n't give myself that right . 
  i have decided to take other way . 
  ** edit : ** btw . 
  also , spent beautifull times with even more beautifull girl from slovenia in netherland . 
  [ serious ] flair . 
  off topic : in what relations is romania with it 's neighbouring countries ? 
  but i wont beacuse i am familiar with situation in croatia , but not in serbia . 
  also croatia is not in bad relations with neighbouring countries , except serbia . 
  ok , tensions with slovenia are a bit high but when we #finally resolve question of savudrijska vala things will calm down . 
   i have actualy.met people from macedonia . . they in fact do lpve serbia . 
  you see i met few of them too . 
  and read something about their history . 
  serbian historical denying of macedonian culture did n't do much good to their relations . 
  only one thing is curently bring them together : albanians . 
  - `` enemy of my enemy is my friend . '', 
   rrepublika srpska is an internationaly recognozed political enthety and a crutial part of bosnia . 
  to which president is refused visa for usa . 
  and key word is `` enthety '' . 
  which means only one part of a country which you repeatedly `` decreasing '' . 
  it 's name is bosnia ** and hercegovina ** . 
  also , serbs are not bih . 
  croats , muslims and serbs are bih . 
  1 of 3 will can not be 3 . 
   and if i remembre correctly serbia didnt run a train with armed man into hungary . 
  what are you saying that croatia invaded hungary ? 
   both were genocidal maniacs supporded by the croats . 
  and you know that dr. tu\u0111man was `` genocidal maniac '' how ? 
  i am not his big fan , beacuse of other things , and would like to hear you explanation . 
   stop doing it than . 
  seriously , how old are you ? 
  are we discusing or throwing random childish sentences ? 
   we killed our nazis an threw them down pits . 
  antifascist battle against the occupying forces and it 's servents in croatia began before slovenian one . 
  i know that very well beacuse my relative was member of that partisan unit . 
  i am not minimazing slovenian antifa battle but that 's the fact . 
  before that our comunists ( and i belive yours too in slo ) were performing multiple diversion in cities across ndh ( i recommend you series `` nepokoreni grad '' which shows it very well ) . 
  like is ' t not the fact that all croats were ustashe and all serbs and slovenias antifascist . 
  history is not black or white . 
  and no , nobody deserves to end in pit no matter who certian i am that my cause is right and others wrong . 
  that makes you better than the other side . 
   oh but you do . 
  the ndh denial is stron in . 
  may i remind you that you havent payed reparations to this day . 
  you also keep policies and spirit of it alive by debying serbs the right to ther krajina ... 
  it is strong but does not and will not prevail . 
  reparations to who ? 
  ourself ? 
  ndh did n't invade any country . 
  seriously , you in debate about ndh you bring out rsk these ? 
  `` country '' with no historical basis and not a single internatioln recognition . 
  true . 
  but * democracy is the worst form of government on earth except for all the rest what does it mean . 
  *  how about the constant discrimination minoreties face in your country to the point they can not even use their own language ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  probably serbian issue , but which one ? 
   i saw it on tv where was the poloce to beat the shit out of that so called church ? 
  must admit i do n't understand fully this statement . 
  police were there beacause it was ** rally in the center of the capital ** . 
  by our laws , police always monitors or at least give you permision to rally . 
   face it pall you people are nazi sypmathozers from the get go . 
  wrong . 
  it 's like i say `` all serbs are chetnics , all germans are nazis '' or `` all slovenians are bjelogardejci '' . 
  generalising is only one more step to hatred . 
  subject of my last `` stru\u010dni rad '' ( i do n't know how to translate it ; is more than regular seminar , but under scientific work ) in law school were children concentration camps in ndh . 
  my grandfather was non-commisioned officer in jna , and other relatives were in partisan movement . 
  some of them wore title `` prvoborac '' . 
  i think you know what it means . 
  also , i know lot of young people who opose extreme-right politics . 
  not because their political orientation is similar to mine , it 's because they can see the difference between good and potential evil ( if we are talking about current situation ) . 
  what then makes us `` nazi symphatizers '' ? 
  you have something against croats . 
  * it can be seen from an airplane * and i am sorry about that , because sloveans are frequent and welcomed tourist in the croatian region from which i came from . 
  serbia has great relations with only serbian part of bih , so we can rule that ~ ~ country ~ ~ out . 
  macedonia ? 
  do you know anything about macedonian history ? 
  ever met someone from there ? 
  ~ ~ loves serbia ~ ~ hungary is protecting it 's own borders , not aiding serbia . 
  be reasonable . 
  same situation in croatia . 
  but it 's not situation like in baltic states were if you say something positive about stalin people look you differently ( in bad way ) . 
   paveli\u0107 was a military man . 
  you , however voted for dr. tu\u0111man what dr. tu\u0111man had to do with paveli\u0107 ? 
   defaced by croats constantly . 
  you are talking like 4 million croats are going around croatia and destroying exyu named streets and statues . 
  come on man ... 
  the stuff you say is dangerous and toxic . 
  it 's like that you have something against croats . 
  yes there are regions and cities ( victims of war ) which removed exyu street and square names , but for example in istria most of the names and statues are intact . 
  in center of pore\u010d there is still statue of partizan joakim rakovac and mayor 's office is still in streets that holds the name of marshal tito . 
   and that you take responsibility for your crimes . 
  in croatia we have saying : `` prvo po\u010disti u svom dvori\u0161tu . '', 
  you know what it means . 
  our people are opening eyes and facing the truth about horrors that ndh and ustashe commited and we do n't need anyone from outside to remind us on that all the time . 
  ustashe are my shame , not yours so leave it to me . 
  yes , there is minority that are refusing to see to truth about ndh and praise it as `` expression of the centuries-old struggle of the croatian people for freedom '' , but which countries do n't have fascists ? 
  even slovenia had and has them now , however small she is . 
  democracy and freedom of speech has it flaws and can be bitch  recent memorial plate to fascism ceremony in jasenovac . 
  the so-called `` orthodox church of croatia '' rally in zagreb , to name just the recent ones . 
  do you know how many people came the that ortodox christmas rally ? 
  not even a houndred .
