when poland and ex-czechoslovakia says `` no '' to germany . 
  [ according to this i am a left wing authoritarian/nationalist . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bq2j8ue.jpg ) wonder how it would have turned out if it was a proper political quiz . 
  i got left authoritarian lol, 
  wow the croatian news television actually used ** that ** clip with the part about the reffugee throwing his wife on the tracks clearly visible ** and ** commented themselves how the police tried to stop them . 
  well seems at least our journalism ai n't shit . 
   but one picture of a small child pulls at our hearts and compels our nature to do something well it sure did n't compel me to anything , it 's another one of those thousands of people dying , and suddenly i should care about it more than any of those other people ? 
  because it is the largest influential slavic country who is currently upholding a necessary balance of power in europe ... 
   you will hardly find a bigger rusophobe than me . 
  and no , i do n't `` just oppose russia 's politics '' , i actually have a strong distaste for russian people 's mentality , nation , history and most things coming from there . 
  sad thing hearing that from a fellow south-slav . 
  you have a funny script . 
  would actually really like to hear someone talk georgian once , tell me how is the caucasus with tourism ? 
  they are probably implying because he went into the forest and a tick bit him because they usually are far more numerous in forests . 
   tfw balkans is too poor for any immigrants to want to say in it, 
  merkel be like : somebody think of the banks, 
  europe ** yes **, 
  titoism was not communism . 
  there are more and more people who are claiming that tito was a criminal . 
  well after some time the anglican church became the predominant . 
  where in croatia is communist symbolism popular ? 
  there are only a few statues and memorials left in istria and some other abandoned things . 
  for a short while . 
  it is better that they get mad for a short while and forget about it , then constantly being reminded about it . 
  are you too stupid to fucking realize that causing hate between balkan peoples is generally ** a bad thing ? 
  ** is it so hard to realize that saying something like that will exactly do nothing else but cause hate ? 
  ** fuck ** does n't incite genocide , za dom has a much much heavier connotation behind itself . 
  well a lot of people claim to believe in god , though if they actually do is up to question . 
  that is mostly because the croatian identity is solely romancatholic , there can not be a protestant croat , and that is why people usually identify themselves as strong believets , to differentiate themselves from bosnians and serbs even though there are many other differences . 
  the serbs on the other hand are not too bothered with that so they do n't really care that much other than nationalists . 
  i was implying the church representatves with my remark . 
  also , za poglavnika is still used , and a lot of people i have personally met ( from both dalmatia , slavonia , zagreb too ) ** outright ** claim to be usta\u0161e , even though they look like and behave like normal people !, 
  fascist symbolism is * way * too popular in our country and should be dealt with . 
   the super jew what ? 
  they also said that * za dom - spremni !, 
  * ( for the homeland - ready ! ), 
  can be a `` double sided '' greeting , that it can also express just `` patriotism '' . 
  please . 
  the greeting is often accompanied by `` za poglavnika ! '', 
  ( `` for the ( head ) leader ! '' ), 
  which is literally like saying on german `` f\u00fcr den f\u00fchrer ! '' . 
  there is only hate and fascist symbolism in these greetings and they should be outlawed , and yes i know that that would be against freedom of speech , but it is a necessary thing to do . 
  on another topic in my opinion the church should at this point be trialed for enticing ethnical violence . 
  i seriously ca n't believe what our church is stating at this point , nor can i believe what the orthodox one is saying too ( a week or more ago a representative of the orthodox church in dalmatia stated that `` serbs too did war crimes , but to a lesser extent ! '' ) . 
  i ca n't remember a single moment these churches , other than in the fucking middle ages , helped our people . 
  ** croatia : ** alright so first of all i have to say that there are , if we ignore smaller ideological differences , 4 types of people in this country : 1 . 
  ultranationalists ( of which there are a lot ) 2 . 
  average people 3 . 
  yugo-nostalgics/critics of the ww2 state 4 . 
  other the first and the forelast obviously have major ideological differences , while the middle is balanced . 
  so let 's get to the questions , we 'll cover the first 3 . 
   years which really matter ( e.g. 
  if the invasion of poland kicks it off , or czechoslovakia , or operation barbarossa to the surrender of japan or surrender of germany ) : ? 
  april 10th , 1941 - establishment of the ndh ( independent state of croatia , nazi puppet state ) may 15th , 1945 - end of ww2 in yugoslavia , partisans won , bleiburg happening  noun associated with the warfare period ( e.g. 
  shelter , fear , patriotism , survival ) : ? 
  noun associated with the end of the war ( e.g. 
  victory , defeat , subjugation , happiness ) : ? 
  ** wartime : ** ultranationalists : patriotism , independence , etc. . . average people : survival , bad time in history yugonostalgics/critics of the ww2 state : disgust , criminal state , genocide , slaughter ** end of war : ** ultranationalists : defeat , shame average : mixed feelings yugonostalgics/critics of the ww2 state : victory , glory , triumph etc. . .  the role of your country in the war ( e.g. 
  pulling power , battlefield , punching bag ) : ? 
  the independent state of croatia was basically a nazi puppet state that undeniably had a certain degree of autonomy during ww2 . 
  basically once the kingdom of yugoslavia was destroyed , the most popular croatian party declined to work with the nazists ( that party was hitlers proposal ) so mussolini 's proposal ( the fascist ustashe organization , basically terrorists that had connections to mussolinis italy ) was accepted and ante paveli\u0107 was installed as the leader of the state . 
  the state functioned as a major source of raw materials for germany 's war engine , cooperated on the red front , and fought in the balkans against the partisans . 
   the perception of your country-men who fought within the wehrmacht or waffen-ss ( e.g. 
  i do not remember a case of them actually being straight up interviewed , because most of them were killed at bleiburg and really if you revealed yourself to be one in yugoslavia you would n't end up well . 
  according to ultranationalists they were patriotic fighters and upheld the ethnical purity of croatia . 
  according to average people there would be mixed-negative feelings for them . 
  yn/cotww2s would say that those fighters were traitors and deserved what they got at bleiburg . 
   the role of national partisans within your country ( e.g. 
  miniscule , patriotic , necessary ) : ? 
  they basically fought against the nazi puppet state ( so basically serbs , croats etc. 
  vs serbs , croats , etc. ), 
  and sought to restore yugoslavia in a socialist spirit . 
  according to ultranationalists ... ah you basically get it . 
  average people are neutral-good towards em . 
  ** bleiburg : ** basically in austria in bleiburg lots of ustashe were caught by partisans and basically killed because of their former crimes . 
  the problem is that 1 . many of these soldiers were not actually soldiers but regular people and even students dressed in ustashe atire and 2 . that still did n't give the partisans the right to do that . 
  ** personal thoughts : ** first of all each and every one of you who revere the ndh as a true croatian state should take a serious look at our history . 
  this state was undoubtly genocidal , and that to that level that german officers had to tell * us * to calm down with the killing . 
  let me just remind everyone of the 1/3rd policy towards serbs , of jasenovac , of srborez and so on . 
  we got off `` lucky '' ( if you could call it a sick joke like that ) that we were trialed like being a puppet state and not having to actually pay as the germans did , and that we were integrated into yugoslavia so we were n't partitioned like germany . 
  this war , and the criminal organization that led it in the balkans was definitely something horrible not only because of violations of human rights , but because of our relations with other balkan nations too . 
  this war not only scratched but tore apart the wounds from ww1 and reignited serbo-croatian hate . 
  i can only praise the partisans ( especially those from sisak and dalmatia , also istria ) which fought against this terror regime , who took up arms against the nazis and sided with their brothers with whom they were only 15 or so years beforehand at war . 
  also concerning bleiburg , if anyone wants i can photocopy parts of the diary my grandfathers brother wrote , which basically tells the story of how they were picked up in highschool by the ustashe and led towards germany , obviously being caught in bleiburg , ** but being freed by a partisan officer once he realized they were just kids . 
  seems its fencing season !, 
  kids drink from like sometimes year 13 . 
  lots of adults do but not a lot usually . 
  on the other hand everything under 25 is drink as much rakija/vodka ( vodka is popular here too ) until you can be happy and fuck around . 
  wine is considered more a buffer/soft drink if anything . 
  legally you have to be 18 i think to drink and it is apparently illegal to do it in public but noone cares . 
  we usually do it in secluded places outside or at someones place . 
  i like how / r/europe is all like `` deport immigrants '' until a country does something against them , and then gets shit on . 
  honestly why not use the script if i know it ? 
  it 's also a minor act of defiance against nationalists in my country for how big a faggots they are . 
  dude i am talking about currently . 
  yugoslavia was great . 
  if they are economic immigrants they fucked themselves over by staying anywhere in the balkans . 
  this ai n't a good idea . 
  not really iron courtain nor cold war nato , but it 's still bad . 
  we sadly have a very nationalist majority .
