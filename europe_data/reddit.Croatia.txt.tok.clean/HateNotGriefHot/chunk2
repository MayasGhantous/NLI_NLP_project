  i am aware of sd , but the damage is already done . 
  economic immigration is going to work out * so , so bad * for sweden . 
  no , it should worry about ** immigration . 
  languages i know : ** serbo-croatian , english , german ** how foreign languages sound : ** italian : ** sounds great , i would define it as very dramatic and melodic . 
  we usually screw around with it in croatia because lots of italians come to dalmatia and you meet them often . 
  ** french : ** sounds smooth but also harsh at points , smug but also kind . 
  not really one of my favourites . 
  ** portugese : ** spanish with harsher sounds . 
  ** dutch : ** literally a combination between english and german with harsh vocals mixed in . 
  sounds ok , kind of funny actually . 
  ** danish : ** uggghh this language is absolutely annoying it sounds like a hello kitty version of swedish . 
  ** swedish : ** for some reason sounds like a chain of ings and ungs to me . 
  language also seems very childish . 
  ** norwegian : ** swedish but more serious swedish . 
  ** finnish : ** sounds the same like hungarian . 
  ** hungarian : ** it sounds as if everyone was baby talking very fast . 
  a lot of shs and hard k 's . 
  ** czech and slovak : ** sound the same , mystic in a normal conversation for me because you can recognize some words . 
  sometimes even sentences pop up that are completely understandable but then it all just derails . 
  ** polish : ** sounds great , strong and maybe even understandable if i tried really hard . 
  spierdalajj ** ukrainian , russian : ** at times sounds very familiar , and at other times sounds japanese . 
  sounds badass and melodic . 
  ** romanian : ** slavic person trying to talk italian . 
  ** greek : ** sounds slightly demonic to me . 
  words are somehow heavy but still give a distinct tempo . 
  ** albanian : ** ??!? 
  funny croatian , idk . 
  ** bulgarian : ** sounds kind of like ukrainian . 
  a little more closer to south slavic languages . 
  tfw albanians and macedonians finally have a common enemy . 
  i would say the 15th may of 1945 when serbs , croats , bosnians , slovenes , montenegrins and macedonians beat together hand in hand one of the strongest enemies europe faced ( in our land ) . 
  first sentence over picture under headline . 
  on our news they showed a clip where a man is literally saying ; `` look the macedonians used tear gas against us !, 
  the macedonian police ! '', 
  well yes and they have the right to do that , you are literally flooding their country illegally . 
   about 90 % of them roma yeah good luck losing them . 
  hide behind hungary as a magnet , have a bad standard of living , have shitloads of red tape , let nazis do what they want to . 
  hide behind hungary as a magnet , have a bad standard of living , have shitloads of red tape , let nazis do what they want to . 
  i think serbia would dissagree . 
  joooooj jaaaaooooo, 
  thanks for holding the power balance in the world !, 
  i just asked because the wording of * permanent german military bases in poland * had a quite ironic tone to it . 
  why ? 
  we all drowned because we did n't * speak up * against the war . 
  tu\u0111man , milo\u0161evi\u0107 and co were fucking psychotic , just people did n't want to say anything . 
  this war was purely caused by nationalism that these fucks enticed and if it was on me they would all hang . 
  `` small extremist minority '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_ibibvdr-w&amp;t=1m13s it 's always the `` minority '' . 
  if we were n't nationalists we would have spoken up against the war on both siides but we did n't . 
  well not all of your guys were clean ... let 's not ignore that the chetniks cooperate with the usta\u0161e . 
  and later when that one man died everything turned to shit because of nationalism . 
  the partisans that fought during ww2 ( serbs , croats , slovenes , bosnians , montenegrins , macedonians ) against the nazi occupation and that founded a country based on brotherhood and unity were the true heroes . 
  just that yugoslavia was not a dictatorship . 
  yes , it was a one party state , but still a much better country than the fake democracies we live in right now . 
  jenna like in jam right ? 
  we glorify it sadly , in many peoples eyes the independent state of croatia was the true croatian state because of its extent and ethnical purity . 
  i fuck with you not . 
  ante paveli\u0107 is still adored by people and many still think that alojzije stepinac is innocent . 
  what is actually the most ironic thing is that later in the war ustashe worked hand in hand with chetniks ( serbian troops , who they actually wanted to kill ) as to fight against the partisans . 
  the chetniks are still glorified by part of the populace in serbia . 
  thankfully some people , but not a lot of them , * do * consider the partisans , who were probably the most rightful fighting force the balkans had , the actual heroes of the war . 
  that is mostly by people who * do n't * want to cook war . 
  vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj burns our flag , we chant ubij ubij srbina , ahh good times . 
  that is just vojislav for you . 
  i would be honestly surprised if he * did n't * burn our flag before one of our holidays . 
  the are a bunch of fucking idiots , they decided to do this during one of our most nationalistic holidays . 
   who gets the reward aaaand you just revealed your mentality . 
  who said that ethnical cleansing is a reward ? 
  i can only conclude from the context that you are implying that the serbs slaughtered in ww2 were the `` reward '' . 
  do you think serb and croat families are seperate ? 
  they were often intertwined , especially before ww2 , and those deaths did n't come as joy to anyone except fascist rulers . 
  imho it would n't come to this war if ; 1 . 
  the memorandum was n't published , 2 . 
  you let us just secede . 
  just that they partly returned , the other part did n't because they lived through war . 
  would a german keep living in france after the franco-prussian war ? 
  just the problem is that croatia can not be at fault for ww2 crimes due to croatia being a puppet state . 
  if you think it through you might just realize that the `` independent '' state of croatia was n't so independent . 
  also borders are borders , we played by the rules , you did n't . 
  yes just that noone is promoting it since it was basically propagated mostly during ww2 under occupation . 
  unlike you who let \u0160e\u0161elj speak on your main square . 
  no but they also had an autonomous entity as per sfry administratve distribution . 
  you did n't and you tried to illegally attain one . 
  7 million serbians were not concentrated in kosovo . 
  also kosovo was already an autonomous entity if you recall . 
  yes but you see there are a million albanians in kosovo . 
  a million . 
  and the memorandum of the serbian academy published that basically claimed that serbia goes all the way to karlovac is * totally * not at fault . 
  well they do . 
  just they declared a new country for themselves within our country . 
  that does not mean equal . 
   that is the official version  the jna soldiers as is the version that the `` jna '' led this war . 
  this was the serbian army that was leading the war , not jna , you just used their weapons , almost all of them , and you left none to us . 
  this war was n't fair from the beginning , but we defended ourselves , and while you keep chanting no\u017e \u017eica srebrenica we will claim we did nothing wrong ( and we did not ) . 
  at the start of the war serbian minoriies set up barricades and declared a new entity ( rsk - republika srpska krajina ) within the borders that the sfry promised us . 
  it was literally lost territory and i do not know how else you should call it . 
  that is because you can not control certain elements in war . 
  remember that in every war prisoners are released too to fight on the fronts , and i doubt we did n't do it . 
  the difference is that oluja was not targeted at ethnic cleansing and our whole wars intent was never ethnic cleansing . 
  relating to rsk . 
  also why is our side being pounded so much for each crime that has been commited in the whole war , while ignoring the serbian side that literally massacred vukovar , shelled dubrovnik and so on and so on ?
