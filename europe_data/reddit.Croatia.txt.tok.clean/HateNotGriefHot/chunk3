  this operation was clean . 
  the reason these serbs relocated is because a military conflict was on-going , and combined with the fearmongering from your side `` usta\u0161e will kill us '' and so on , these people fled . 
  the croatian army had a right , as has every army , to restore our territory which lost with the krajina . 
  yep well actually serbo-croatian since it 's the same word in both languages , just here it is written on cyrillic . 
  it 's good but you 've still got accent , also you skipped the `` i '' at the beginning . 
  what bunch of idiots . 
  if they want to join a right wing paramilitary then join the azov battalion . 
  these right sector scrubs are nothing but corrupt too . 
  this is so wrong . 
  historically ? 
  yes . 
  currently ? 
  we used to be a force to be reckoned with while autonomous , even making the venetians pay us so they could safely trade in the adriatic , and even helping the serbs with the bulgarians out . 
  under hungarian rule we too accomplished great things , like for example protecting alongside hungary europe from the ottomans for cca 400 years and being the first county named antemurale christianitatis . 
  not to forget nikola tesla was raised and ** schooled ** too in our country ( yes he was of serb descent it 's shared history ) . 
  currently while independent we managed to accomplish , well , nothing really special outside of robbing our country . 
  brussels , coming from zagreb i was seriously horrified how the ghettos and everything that is not the center looks . 
  hehe, 
  this is gold . 
  ok then . 
  our tourist season starts somewhere around spring , i personally have apartments booked already in may . 
  this due to the tourist season . 
  wait for dec/jan and then we will see . 
  why was this guy throwing stuff at the police anyways ? 
  backstory ? 
  really ? 
  do you have some pictures maybe ? 
  [ just wait until croatia starts using glagoljica again . 
  tako je, 
  you 've got it wrong . 
  after five year they receive it for free if they used it for legal purposes , if they did illegal stuff the russian government will confiscate it . 
  yes the are , because the long term effects of what they did affected far more people in much worse ways . 
  not if those citizens did not leave the russia or the us . 
  these murdered people were mainly fascists or thieves that left yugoslavia as to not be prosecuted . 
  first of all stop taking a moral highground by indicating fallacies . 
  you are talking about a subject that you have bo idea about . 
  many people still have nostalgic feelings about tito and yugoslavia even in croatia . 
  you know what ? 
  yes it 's ok they slaughtered those people . 
  the only sad thing is that they did n't slaughter milo\u0161evi\u0107 , tu\u0111man and all the other fuckwits that screwed everything up too . 
  yes , if they were n't fucking dissidents , they would n't have to be killed . 
  what would happen in germany after ww2 if someone started yelling heil hitler again ? 
  also what massacres are you talking about ? 
  the west did n't massacre us haha , yes ww2 did cause genocide but that did not contribute to the hatred as much as the earlier preset factors . 
  they divided us by religion , spheres of influence and other ways during the years , put us up against eachother and basically caused all of this hatred . 
  on the topic of yugoslavia , you have to differentiate what the jna was ( at the time of the war ) - not a yugoslav army , but a serbian army , that was led by one of the fuckwits i mentioned earlier and many more i did n't mention .

  at one point his small , but heroic , unit managed to destroy an entire battalion of 60 tanks and armored vehicles of the serb army . 
  the battle of vukovar would later go into history as an important battle , due to it being a pyrrhic victory for serb forces and due to it delaying their armies until we could muster weapons .

  if those are dead croats they fucked themselves over . 
  udba had agents stationed at train stations that would yell '' \u017divio ante paveli\u0107 ! '', 
  and `` za dom spremni !, 
  '' , which were outright fascist greetings and those who answered to them would be eliminated . 
  if we just did this more intensely ( on both sides !, 
  ) , the 90 's shit would have happened . 
  what the yugoslav government did is nothing to all the genocide that is directly the wests fault in our region . 
  also note that tito himself was a croat . 
  it 's is kind of ironic is n't it ? 
  the western countries , former imperialists , now have to take buttloads of immigrants while my poor country takes a minimal amount . 
  fuck it 's good to be poor . 
  croatia has an ongoing arbitrage with slovenia over the gulf of piran . 
  recently audio files were leaked ( it was the serbian intelligence services who actually discovered these files ) which revealed that the slovenian side of the arbitrage has influenced judges and probably already made the deal how the gulf of piran will be divided ... 
  in the conversation it can be heard that `` the slovenian side will most definetely receive 2/3rds of the gulf of piran , if not more '' . 
  the judge also apparently told slovenian representatives to not stress themselves as much in court , because the matter has already been decided upon . 
  if anyone needs help with the translation ( this is the google translate function since i found nothing on english speaking news portals ) just ask away .

  no shit the amount of hungarians flocking over here to our coast is endless . 
  then certain nations would be disregarded as for example mine . 
  fuck that . 
  the rules go for everyone , or noone . 
  i like my city how it is . 
  i 'm just joking . 
  good luck from croatia catalonia !, 
  if you ever need a paramilitary to defend you from great-spanish aggression call us !, 
  it seems nobody heard here for the ljubljanska banka affair , so let me bring you up to date . 
  ljubljanska banka was one of the best banks in former yugoslavia . 
  when the war started , instead of allowing the citizens to take their savings ( ** 130,000 of them ** ) , they closed down and never repailed the bills . 
  end . 
  ** two words : ljubljanska banka ** *** dvije rije\u010ci : ljubljanska banka ***,

  you think greece is bad ? 
  they atleast * tried * doing something . 
  we are in * debt to greece * . 
  fyi dubrovnik was not a venetian port city ... 
  it was a free market republic ( google ragusa ) , that often times competed with the venetians . 
  this is wrong haha . 
  croatians in * favor of losing independence * ? 
  haha no .
