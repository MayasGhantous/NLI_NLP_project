slavic languages = drinking buddies for life , endless comical miscommunication , grammar fights . 
  it 's the usual pseudo-intellectualism , and west europeans like someone under them and not on more equal level with them so they can have a pet project , feel better about themselves , practice their `` humanitarianism '' ( egoism , messiah complex , narcissism ) and israel is more developed than palestine is , or the products of muslim incest marriages ever will be so it 's popular to be `` champion '' for the current `` underdog '' no matter what . 
  west europe has a fetish for being humanitarian and dragging around war orphans , starved kids , unwashed hoards across borders without documenting or checking their `` papers '' so they can be applauded as `` noble , '' `` kind , '' `` altruistic '' , `` morally superior '' and whatnot . 
  pro tip : in life , always stay away from such `` war and tragedy parasites '' people . 
  oh do n't worry , there is plenty of apologist for muslim terrorism in west europe as well ( oh , wait it 's not muslim , it 's oppressed peoples that did n't get enough `` respect '' ) , as we all know islam has nothing to do with muslims or islam for that matter . 
  basically , nobody actually cares about palestine ( it 's fake , all of it ) , or israel for that matter . 
  it 's about seeming `` revolutionary '' among your buddies , `` cool '' in front of the chicks , and `` intellectual '' because you can parrot what you saw on tv or in one or two biased documentaries or what the flower children and lennon said about `` peace and orgies and luv luv . '', 
  personally , am not on either side of this eternal ballad since i do n't see either side actually caring about their own people and children at this point . 
  what will be will be .

  you 're kind of melancholic like turnips . 
  when the ex prime minister ivo sanader was released from prison we had the sarcastic `` daddy 's coming home '' and making fun of him and his patronizing remarks , political mafia , judicial system , other celebs and corruption . 
  it went viral .

  i 'll kiss ya germany . 
  god knows , maybe you need it . 
  ehehehe , kissinator, 
  i sense something troubles finland ... come on over here so we can smooch therapy you . 
  that 's foreplay . 
  when your family is particularity happy with you or you 're sick in bed ; smooch on the forehead . 
  your close friends do n't kiss you because they 're sick and tired of seeing you every day anyways . 
  your family members kiss you twice on the cheeks your female neighbors/grannies kiss you once or twice on the cheeks your distant cousins hug you to death and try to kill you with food offerings your male friends shake hands or give a male nod from afar your elders and authority figures judge your entire existence , until you pass their shit-tests and then you get a pat , or kiss on one cheek or congratulations or head nod with a `` when i was your age , we made our own shoes '' when meeting your girl friends after two days of not seeing them : screech and hug attacks no time for kisses when meeting someone new ; usually just handshakes and meeting gestures and words , once or twice kisses depending on circumstances and the spiritual esoteric vibe the other persons are giving out holidays ; time to smooch and hope the gifts are expensive, 
  scotland over here is filed under `` does n't stink , nor does it smell good '' so basically nobody knows much nor cares much about your political/social/economic circumstances and/or situation . 
  why do n't you go to a library and read some books , go through archives carefully . 
  this is n't about `` ko nas ( bre ) zavadi '' , you idiot . 
  it 's just some vital facts about historic relations between wee lil cros and wee lil serbs . 
  like i give much of a shit about either side 's eternal whine . 
  never said it was solely austrians/hungarian 's fault , they just knew how to stir shit up to their own benefits as much as and whenever possible and/or additionally flame it as much as possible . 
  ah well , karma 's a bitch . 
  since pavelic 's wife was part jewish , i always wonder how dinnertime went over at their house ... their daughter gave an interview about him and her mother before her death in madrid , she said he had to do ( racial laws were a condition made by the germans ) what he did for the `` greater good '' of keeping the country out of nazi clutches , and communists , and made up the `` honorary arians '' title to save some of the jews . 
  germans did whine when the laws were not enforced . 
  shrugs, 
  too many of you , we trust karma will do her job . 
  austrians / / hungarians used to flame the conflict between serbs and croats ie divide an conquer centuries ago , and some of the mofos fell for it . 
  yeah , croatia number one !!!,

  well , okay , it was n't the same as in ussr of course , and some of the historians and political theorists call the form of yugoslav socialism as `` titoism '' , and the hard-core theorist do n't see yugoslavia as `` socialist '' and others were yammering how `` yugoslavia was an advanced socialist post-revolutionary country '' . 
  sighs , it 's the usual wankathon , you could go on about this til kingdom come . 
  in economic sense , we had to move towards a mix of capitalism and socialism , open market , and also politically we went the `` non-aligned '' path so we were unique snowflakes in many ways . 
  but certain influences are n't domination so ... ehehehe , yugoslavia versus soviet union 1:0 . 
  well ... the exchange of `` socialism '' theories and practices are kind of an impact . 
  butthurt butthurt butthurt at least we have friends . 
  oooooohhhhhh, 
  * headdesk * why do n't you go to your beloved usa and enjoy the `` freedumb '' over there , eh ? 
  cause times have changed ... a lot . 
  and now we have eussr . 
  times really do change . 
  really ? 
  not even on street markets ? 
  some have it from family members , some moved from ussr to here , some worked or lived there , ties to ex soviet countries , military stuff , some traded with bulgarian street markets etc. 
  i guess collectors still earn money on it as well . 
  i think one of the biggest street markets with ussr and even nazi crapiola i ever saw was in sofia , bulgaria . 
  you need to know the right people , perhaps . 
  lulz . 
  i am not a west euro nor do i identify with them , there 's no amount of eu propaganda to make me `` feel '' differently . 
  my country did n't colonize anyone so `` y' all '' is unnecessary .
