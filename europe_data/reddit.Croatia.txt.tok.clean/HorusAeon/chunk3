  marija juric zagorka ( 1873 - 1957 ) ; first female journalist , pissed off the male journalists , novelist , i think she even wrote one of the longest literary works ever on the planet ( must check , and not sure if it was officially recognized ) , urged people to speak croatian during hungarization and germanization in croatia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyarization . 
  you can see her statue in zagreb or ask at the tourist board for a tour of the mystic secrets of past times in zagreb told via marija 's works ( centered around history , witch-hunts and socio-political and religious issues of the times ) and actors http://www.tajnegrica.hr/index.php?lang=en she refused work at a hungarian newspaper even though some of the croatian newspapers offices at first did n't want her . 
  she was a very popular novelist despite some issues and lack of support . 
  she ran away from her husband so her family disowned her , in case people wonder why she was working back then ... lel . 
  she was backed up during her journalist work by some of religious leaders and other male colleagues , especially since she would n't shut up about croatian patriotism . 
  she did sign her work with pseuds for quite some time tho , and some of the male journalists were jealous her work was so popular and wide spread . 
  she did receive recognition for her work from hungarian journalists association tho , and not croatians . 
  a german publisher urged her to start writing for women , but she refused to publish it in german language so she published a journal for women herself . 
  she dropped the first journal since her co-female-journalist thought women would want to read house related stuff , and started another one called `` croatian women '' and focused on `` croatian political issues '' , feminism , female rights , croatian history which the female subscribers preferred than the household baloney . 
  the `` croatian women '' also reported on how the croatian women went to protest the khuen-h\u00e9derv\u00e1ry 's visit , and croatian peasant women that put a croatian flag on a hungarian train ... unfortunatly , when the ustashe 's regime ( nazi occupation ) came to power the journal was banned and marija tried to commit suicide ( drank poison ) but was found in her apartment on time . 
  while the ustashe wanted her to write for them , she screwed them over several times since she refused to give her manuscripts , write anything new and beneficial to them , and showed them a work based on ridiculing the german absolutism in croatia . 
  they kept sending her officers to `` persuade '' to write this and not that , change this and stop saying that , but she kept trolling them until the ustashe regime was taken down . 
  she was living in poverty at the time so her readers use to send her gifts and some money so she could survive . 
  she died in abject poverty , most of the publishers screwing her over for royalties . 
  many more ... just thought of her today . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marija_juri%c4%87_zagorka `` kamen na cesti ( a stone on the road ) - an autobiographical novel detailing the author 's early life . 
  the main themes are the authors own undying patriotism is which she finds the comfort and reason to overcome all tragedies and obstacles in her life . 
  the novel deals with the themes of marriage , family abuse , discrimination and love , where the author concludes that her greatest love and devotion goes to her croatian country for which she was prepared to sacrifice her wealth , good name , career offers and life , yet sees croatia 's freedom as her greatest joy and treasure .

  i dunno , we might get bored and you know rest of europe loves to start shit with or without us .

  those fucking bastards !, 
  this one is funnier ... `` picokijada [ pits\u0254kijada ] is a traditional cultural-tourist manifestation that has been held since 1968 at the end of june in the podravina town of \u0110ur\u0111evac in croatia . 
  the event lasts three days , and the main event is legenda o picokima [ l\u025b\u0261\u025b\u014bda \u0254 pits\u0254kima ] ( legend of the rooster ) , a remembrance of the defense of the people of the town \u0110ur\u0111evac from the turks under the title . 
  `` picokijada - legenda o picokima '' . 
  legenda o picokima is set in the time of the attack of the turkish army on the old town \u0110ur\u0111evac . 
  as ulama-beg encountered unexpected resistance and failed to defeat the defenders of \u0110ur\u0111evac with an army , he decided on a long siege with the goal of starving the army and the people that hid inside . 
  the legend says that in the surrounded fortress the food had vanished . 
  all that was left was one small rooster ( picok [ pits\u0254k ] ) . 
  this could not feed the people , so an old woman suggested to the captain of the town that the rooster should be put in a cannon and shot into the turkish camp . 
  thinking that there was plenty of food in the fortress , ulama-beg ended the siege and left the battlefield . 
  as a curse , ulama-beg calls the people of \u0110ur\u0111evac picoki [ pits\u0254ki ] , or `` roosters '' . 
  [ 1 ] at the end of this scene he says in croatian : '' a vi tamo , pernati junaci , \u0161to picekima bojeve bijete , ime picoka dovijeka nosili !, 
  picokima vas djeca zvala , a unuci va\u0161i ostat \u0107e picoki ! '' ( english : '' and you there , feathered heroes , that fight battles with roosters , shall always carry the name roosters !, 
  your children shall call you roosters , and your grandchildren will stay roosters ! '' ) . 
  the display of legenda o picokima is under the protection of the republic of croatia ministry of culture as the first intangible cultural heritage of republic of croatia , as well as being the biggest tourist attraction of podravina . '', 
  i see ... well ... coughs , it will get better . 
  it 's looking up in ship building , food production , robotic mine manufacturing , metal industry ... fuck it , we even have hybrid/electric cars production . 
  stop the whine and excuses , time to put on the big slavic pants and do the impossible !, 
  slava !, 
  you got ta go out and live a little . 
  hmm , the all-mother myths , triple goddess ( good , neutral , bad ) , triple god . 
  also , all folk tale fusion work done by ivana brlic mazuranic , and also marija juric zagorka 's novels ( secret of the bloody bridge ) which do cross-over into the mythos , esoterics of folk history , myths , and socio-political times of the past . 
  `` a seminal collection of short stories by the acclaimed children 's author ivana brli\u0107-ma\u017eurani\u0107 originally published in 1916 in zagreb by the matica hrvatska publishing house . 
  the collection is considered her masterpiece and it features a series of newly written fairy tales heavily inspired by motifs taken from ancient slavic mythology of pre-christian croatia . 
  due to this way of combining original fantasy plots with folk mythology , brli\u0107-ma\u017eurani\u0107 's writing style has been compared by literary critics to hans christian andersen and j. r. r. tolkien . 
  indeed , the 1922 english translation by f.s. 
  copeland was published in london by george allen & unwin , the same company which would go onto publish tolkien 's the hobbit and lord of the rings trilogy .
