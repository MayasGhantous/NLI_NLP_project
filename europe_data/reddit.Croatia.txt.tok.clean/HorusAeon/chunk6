  croatia is in a peacekeeping mission , peace support for nato , isaf military support and honestly most of our soldiers just say they feel really bad for the people over there so they go back even though the first time they got there they were like `` what a sand-dump/undeveloped/poor / dangerous etc '' .

  i live in croatia , our waiters can be rude as fuck and i love 'em for it . 
  ahahaha so true about drinking beer for hours without pressure .

  tell the rude waiter next time in belgrade to bring you the complaint book and/or ask for the boss/manager when in europe .

  `` a waiter should serve food ; not become your friend . '', 
  edit ; i just realized sensitive folk on this site come and misinterpret everything , so just for the record , i was a waiter and i left people in peace when they were eating , talking , drinking etc.

  minimum wages in croatia averaged 388.81 eur/month from 2008 until 2016 , reaching an all time high of 414.45 eur/month in december of 2016 and a record low of 372.35 eur/month in june of 2013 . 
  minimum wages in croatia is reported by the eurostat . '', 
  http://www.tradingeconomics.com/croatia/minimum-wages i am personally against minimum wage laws because they lead to higher unemployment , outlaws freaking jobs for crying out loud , and expansions of black market and gray market labour/services etc. 
  i hate to break it to you ; but we would n't have anyone to laugh at without america so we all love you ... well , when we 're not face-palming that is . 
  i 've protected my house with garlic so i am not worried . 
  both are hilarious , and completely irrelevant , it 's the ficus position anyways . 
  hmmm , how to fix the system ... well , maybe you all need a new system . 
  is n't it enough that humans have ruined one planet ? 
  i mean , seriously !? 
  hehehe, 
  i always saw croatia having good similar ties with poland ... but you 're right , hungary too even tho they hate us ... ahahahaha, 
  poland or russia or czech republic or slovakia or belarus ... but my croatia is the best and would not move . 
  shine bright like a diamond and exit eu . 
  druid naked tushes and hips that do n't lie were not what even the romans feared ... http://21stcenturywire.com/2014/10/12/ancient-druids-why-were-the-romans-so-afraid-of-them/, 
  yeah , in croatia we all want to separate from our government . 
  alas , the parasites are stuck to us . 
  then again , we have the anti-eu peeps as well . 
  freedom !!!!, 
  poor croatia , always in yunions .

  the street ones are making more money, 
  yes , it 's racist and offensive to the other non-middle eastern asians . 
  they 're very sensitive in the us . 
  similar happening in west europe , pray it never reaches us in the central , east , south-east ... imagine , all our humor gone down the drain over snowflakes snowflaking and being hypocrites . 
  * shudders * * prays to mary *, 
  they got some good detective series , but besides that and only fools and horses , i do n't really care about the uk or brexit .

  mayo , tomatoes , green salad , garlic , butter . 
  and britain is reaping what they had sown and what they sow these days . 
  also note that indians sold their own backbones long before the brits came over , and afterwards . 
  that caste system is n't british . 
  lel the same for muslim cultures , they will never know any progress or peace due to their past and present butchering and inhuman practices . 
  i am not judging , the `` peoples '' judged themselves . 
  such is the cycle/spiral of history . 
  meanwhile , no mass sexual harassment on new year 's in hungary , or eastern european countries ... thank fuck , we 're `` waycist '' . 
  lel everything is relevant , past and present and future are tied for an eternity . 
  well , lets see there was the ottoman empire butchering and enslavement for centuries ... oh , we just `` love '' the muslims . 
  all cultures are equal , a little bit of first cousin marriage , incest babies with severe defects , fgm , stoning , acid throwing , gang raping , sexual assaults at concerts , streets , malls , holidays , and bombing is just a cultural thing the rest of us do n't comprehend the richness of the cultural enrichment . 
  well , actually ... http://www.newenglishreview.org/norman_berdichevsky/the_myth_of_the_golden_age_of_tolerance_in_medieval_muslim_spain/ `` the muslims did not constitute anywhere near a majority of the population that numbered approximately 7 million christians and jews at the time of the first conquest in 711-716 . 
  by the beginning of the tenth century it has been estimated that the muslim population of berbers , arabs and muladies ( christians who had converted to islam ) was approximately 2.8 million out of a total of more than 7 million .
