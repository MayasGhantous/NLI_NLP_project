  frankly i 'm not sure since other people mentioned it as well . 
  you can always come tonight and see what happens . 
  even if it 's taken , you can get something else . 
  after this session ends and things stabilize a bit , we 'll create some sort of excel table where we can see who 's playing what . 
  we have n't even talked about random new world , so i guess we 're going with the same world as this one . 
   uh i 'm not sure what 's left ... 
  there 's a lot of players in already ( i think there 's a limit of 32 ? 
  ) , but most of the hre is empty ( except saxony , hamburg , brandenburg , austria ) . 
  ** denmark ** is free but sweden is a human too , you could possibly go ** scotland ** but england 's scary , basically nothing is taken in india and indonesia , etc. 
  you can always try to join tonight , look at the map , see what 's free and pick something . 
  well you can always just use ctrl+f for your desired nation and see what 's available . 
  noone 's taken naples so far . 
  but you 're right , we probably should 've made a googledocs excel table or something . 
  not very much probably . 
  oooh right , did n't even see that . 
  well we 're still missing aragon , so you could pick that if a player who 's going to play all 4 hours wo n't ( noone reserved it so far ) . 
  it 's close to morocco anyways . 
  we need a mediterranean power to balance the italians like genoa etc. 
  i do n't know . 
  you can just ctrl+f florence and see who said it first . 
  you can also agree amongst each other if you can . 
  sure , morocco is free . 
  unfortunately it has . 
  currently italians are genoa , florence , savoy , venice . 
  will you take aragon ? 
  it 's still available . 
  alright , looks like the only other nation we need to have the most important ones filled is aragon , so if anyone wants it please take it . 
  well i mean nothing prevents you from getting a good defensive alliance and just going tall and trading in the mediterranean . 
  suits yourself though in any case . 
  if you do n't know what to pick , we still need an aragon . 
  plus you have a naples pu so you could go into italy if you want . 
  it was taken just 15 minutes ago : / https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/47rl8d/reuropes_eu4_campaign_no2_round_1_coming_soon/d0fpq26, 
  well dakarans started with florence ended up being the strongest nation in the game . 
  however , he had a lot of circumstances on his side ( ottomans ganked , austria fell apart , he had big allies ) . 
  it 's doable , you just need to be careful not to get too much aggressive expansion in italy . 
  you need good allies , maybe get a deal with austria that you help italy stay in hre and he lets you have italian lands or something like that . 
  yeah , stuff has changed a bit . 
  now you have estates ( in a separate tab ) , basically burghers , nobility and clergy . 
  you have to keep them in check ( keep them loyal and below 80 % influence ) . 
  if they get too influential you 'll have a terrible time . 
  other than that big change , i 'm not sure what else is different . 
  when did you last play ? 
  did forts cost maintenance back then/could you move through enemy forts ? 
  if you 're planning on playing regularly ( because it sucks having a major nation played by ai ) , i 'd recommend picking lithuania ( or poland if you 're sure noone will go lithuania , so you can get the polish lithuanian commonwealth ) . 
  my ottomans are looking for a defensiveish ally in that area so we could work together and i could help you survive against muscowy/teutonic order/brandenburg who are probably going to be allied . 
  you 'll get the ropes quite quickly . 
  when we started the last mp game , i knew nothing about the estates and i did quite well nonetheless . 
  yeah , you can just take timurids and immediately release persia and play as it . 
  you should n't have much trouble getting independence since you 'll be at least as big as the ai timurids . 
  plus my ottomans might help you get independence if we can get a nice agreement between us . 
  should be next week at the same time . 
  oh man , that 's so cool . 
  i 'm sorry this game 's at this time , i 've always wanted to do a proper ck2 multiplayer ... 
  does it work well with a large number of players ? 
  is there a thread for that game ? 
  i might want to watch if from afar . 
  i think i will stick with them since others have claimed my alternatives , sorry . 
  most probably not , we already had such players and they had no issues, 
  ok well your download sucks , but your upload is same as mine and i have not had problems . 
  as long as nothing else like downloads or others in your house is using the net , you might be fine . 
  no , only the host 's dlcs are important and dakarans has them all . 
  what is your download/upload ? 
  guys , we need a strong austria , aragon , burgundy , portugal to have some balance in europe . 
  if you 're gon na be a regular player , think about taking some of those . 
  yeah , for some weird reason i do n't mind taking ottomans that much , but i could never bring myself to play a blobbing serbia ... xd, 
  well we need regular players on the bigger nations , and it 's not there 's no challenge . 
  even though i was among the biggest last game , i was constantly threatened from a lot of sides . 
  if you picked lithuania i do n't really think you could ever relax completely , despite how strong you 'd be . 
  come on , i was hoping to have you as a reliable ally . 
  it 's not too late to pick , pick france or lithuania :p, 
  i 'm picking ottomans for myself as i think they 're pretty important for game balance . 
  last game they got destroyed and that caused a huge power vacuum . 
  i might trade them for something else later but right now i 'm sticking with them . 
  it 's about the right to procreation , and it is different than incest because here you would forbid them children in general , but with incest you are just forbidding it with relatives .

  yeah , imo 4 hours would be cool . 
  ideally , i 'd want it to be in the european afternoon , for example 16:00 -20:00 gmt +1 , but i understand if that does n't suit people ( does it ? ) . 
  if not , we could still do something like 19:00 -23:00 gmt +1 , or 20:00 -00:00 gmt +1, 
  okay so we 're gon na be starting a new game since this one 's over . 
  more or less the consensus is that we want to start the new one next week already . 
  i hope everyone 'll join , including arathian who wanted to have a month long break . 
  i 've created a temporary subreddit where we 'll discuss setting up some ground rules so that we wo n't have the weird situations like mega alliances etc. 
  for example limiting the number of human-human allies . 
  the link is here : https://www.reddit.com/r/euro4rules/ we should agree upon the rules until sometime thursday , so we can figure everything out in time . 
  i 'm fine with both 4 and 5 hours , but i think we should start at least an hour sooner . 
  if you ask me , the best choice would be sundays late afternoon/evening , so we 're done by 23:00 gmt +1 . 
  i 'm saying this because some of us like to go out on friday/saturday , and/or are employed and have to go to work monday morning . 
  because of this game , i could n't go out for drinks with people on saturdays for 3 months . 
  it 's a challenge alright , with -3 stability , rebels up the wazoo , bankrupted , etc. 
   the last player drove it into the ground a bit when he refused to surrender in a war . 
  but hey , all power to you if you manage to get it back up and running . 
  just be prepared to face greedy neighbours , you 're probably gon na lose some stuff if you do n't play your cards very well . 
  lithuania player has quit but quite a bit of it was eaten by hungary and russia after he did that , so i 'm not sure how survivable it is . 
  i think the japan player also quit ( but am not sure ) , you could take it , but it 'll be tough to expand . 
  hindustan is still good , although it has no chance against italy anymore . 
  yeah , it 's kind of tough basically . 
  apart from maybe some colonial nation , i ca n't think of any viable choices at this point . 
  you might be able to save prussia , but in my opinion it 's a fool 's errand at this point . 
  well if new provinces are being added ( and it seems they are by the dev diary ) , then it 's almost certain savegames wo n't be backwards compatible .
