  i have a thing i need to be at today , but i 'll do my utmost to get back home by 7 pm gmt . 
  if i 'm late , i hope the guy who takes france will give it back at the 8:30 rehost , but no hard feelings if he does n't , of course . 
  okay , this was great imo . 
  see you all next week !, 
  let 's have voice next time , too . 
  france shall rise again !, 
  awesome , i 'll definitely join you guys . 
  i 've sent you a friend invite on steam . 
  i just hope i 'll really get to play and not desync or something ... :( i 'd even like to play as croatia if whoever plays hungary wants to release it ... d :, 
  it 'd be quite interesting to see a per capita version as well . 
  i mean that 's basically ireland legally stealing other countries ' taxes . 
  i never heard of it . 
  point taken , thanks for the clarification . 
  what do you mean it goes to orban , how so ? 
  paying interest on bonds is called taking on debt , all capitalist countries do it , and it 's a good choice when the investments the money is used for generate growth bigger than the interest rate . 
  my point is n't that those chinese people are good or bad , it 's that they have nothing to do with immigration on a massive scale which is what we 're talking about here . 
  such immigration is a problem because people who immigrate are often uneducated and wo n't fit into society culturally or economically within a reasonable time frame . 
  i doubt there 'd be such a problem with chinese people . 
  also , i am not from hungary , see my flag . 
  the ones who have 400000 euros are better for the country , yes . 
  not to mention that i have never heard of chinese people blowing themselves up . 
  thousands of their tourists come to my country and we have no complaints about them . 
  congrats on your citizenship !, 
  you 're right , thanks for the correction . 
  hm i might 've been wrong , but i could 've sworn it was in the 900s the kingdom was formed , but fair point , the duchies were there before . 
  technically croatia 's existed in one way or another since the 10th century ( bunch of duchies , independent kingdom , kingdom under personal union , `` kingdom of slovenes , croats and serbians '' , republic within first yugoslavia , then second yugoslavia ) , but i get what you mean . 
  aliens are scheduled to invade right about then . 
  thanks , it 's nice to be here , despite the current problems eu 's having , 
  at some point in history ? 
  it never stopped being croatian territory ( except for a short time when knin was held by venice a few hundred years ago ) . 
  stop pretending like yugoslavia was a unitary state . 
  whatever , you or whoever else , the point is what i said - that you 're supporting a wrong view , not your nationality . 
  croatia does not pretend it was a saint through its history , we 've apologized for the stuff from ww2 ( not to mention that during ww2 there was essentially a civil war as a lot of croatians were in the partizans ) , and we 've prosecuted a lot of individual crimes commited during our war of independence . 
  as for crap like ethnic cleansing , you can check that weak argument at the door . 
  i should not have even started discussing this with you as i doubt anything will come of it , but i simply ca n't let you spread fallacious views in here without challenging them . 
  that 's like if a swedish city with a majority immigrant population wanted to secede from sweden . 
  there 's more to statehood than being the majority , croatia existed within yugoslavia and that was part of its territory all the while , decisions of countries within yugoslavia was even legal in the yugoslavian constitution - just accept that the serbian politicians ( and those who supported them ) were the main dicks in the situation . 
  if you want to get along with your neighbours , you should rid yourselves of these myths that somehow you guys are the victims , although you 've started a whole set of wars . 
  we can probably forgive what happened and move on as a collective , provided you do n't constantly deny your crimes . 
  and do n't give me that shit about ww2 , `` they did it 50 years ago '' does in no way excuse your actions . 
  you should look towards germany as a shining beacon of what a country that was wrong in a war should do . 
  nobody sane today would hold ww2 against germany , and they did worse things than serbia . 
  could you be more obtuse ? 
  i 'm not really angry , i 'm just venting a bit because frankly it 's ridiculous how much attention this stuff gets . 
  you 're right that i could 've been polite , i 'm just kind of tired of being polite every time there 's a `` let 's talk about how people in the balkans are inferior and uncivilized '' thread . 
  get real here , people have already tried to explain to you and you 're just pigheadedly refusing to understand . 
  you 're ridiculous and you know nothing . 
  i do n't see how he governed croatia for 15 years which is what / u/a _ nest_of_nope said . 
  also , tell me how he was an ** ultra ** nationalist , what would that exactly mean for you ? 
  i 'm not saying he was a saint and i mostly do n't give a crap , but the claim that we were governed by ultranationalist for 15 years is completely untrue . 
  how are they perceived ? 
  we mostly do n't give a shit . 
  that 's how i perceive them , we have more important problems than talking about bullshit that happened 70 years ago . 
  the only thing that pisses me off are these articles by `` experts '' on history , but who are in no way experts on what croatian society looks like today . 
  i do n't owe you or anyone a nice handholding explanation every bloody time you shit on my society . 
  we 've tried to explain to you , and you just obtusely ignored what / u/civnewbie was trying to tell you . 
  you stick with whatever you want , read all that sensationalist stuff for all i care , you 're the one who 's going to be misinformed . 
  i 'll focus on the things in the year 2016 . 
  now go away . 
  the point is that there are far right people everywhere , the foreign media just likes to have a massive fucking circlejerk about it happening over here and pat themselves on the back . 
  the truth is , almost nobody gives a shit about that stuff and i find it very insulting to have us criticized constantly for something that 's false information . 
  at least we 're on the same side in this subthread . 
  piss off you arrogant cunt . 
  please , what ultranationalists governed croatia ? 
  give me a break with all this `` everyone 's equally guilty '' bullshit . 
  it 's like saying that just because of dresden the allies and nazis were the same . 
  feel free to whine about the nazi comparison and miss the point . 
  i agree , people in this area are normal people and this is not a zoo , so shove your smug arrogant attitude . 
  he is the one who mentioned it , no need to derail the discussion since it is irrelevant . 
  not at all the same thing due to how those languages developed , aka american branched out of english , and germans and austrians being basically the same people at one point . 
  do n't force an analogy to make your point . 
  i figured something like that was the case , i was just joking a bit . 
  see , we spell it ne seri , we are basically martians . 
  it might be very similar , and linguistically possibly the same language - i do n't know , i 'm not a linguist - but it is most assuredly not the exact same thing in regards to vocabulary , some pronunciations/accents , certain rules of grammar like word ordering , etc. 
  no matter how much people like to try to troll us with these statements that were for a long time a symbol of an attempted genocide of our culture ... 
  cunt alert . 
  other things you might want to look at are : * the percentage of your monthly earnings that goes to rent * how much absolute money you have after ** basic ** life expenses ( hint , in the parts of europe i mentioned , for many people this is 0 ) . 
  why ? 
  because things like cars , electronics and vacations cost the same everywhere . 
  * how much actual things you can buy monthly after basic expenses ( basically the previous point adjusted for costs of services like restaurants etc. ), 
  average rent in croatia 's capital should be around 300 euros , and an average paycheck is 668 euros ( of course though , people can live with their partner/family/roommates ) . 
  food is more expensive . 
  computers are just as expensive . 
  cars are just as expensive . 
  vacations are just as expensive . 
  music lessons ? 
  forget about it . 
  now to be fair , i 'm not trying to make this a contest on who has it harder , i 'm just trying to provide perspective . 
  i 'm not saying you guys should n't strive to enable everyone in your country to live a good life - i do agree that in a good world children * would * have access to stuff like sports , excursions , art , activities , etc. 
  the only thing cheaper in the east and southeast of europe is rent and restaurants ( and we call them luxuries here ) . 
  utilities and food , for example , are more expensive in croatia than in germany . 
  too many times i see this stuff about relative costs of life on this sub , it 's much much less than you think . 
  i do n't know if it causes you guilt or something to know you 're much more well off , but them 's the facts . 
  precisely , in parliament . 
  because they are more than a joke over there , i mean some of them are in the government . 
  can you imagine the shitstorm if the situation was like that in croatia ? 
  i can hardly imagine the headlines , not to mention how much the international community would shit on us , and that time rightfully unlike now . 
  unlike some mainstream ( ! ), 
  politicians in serbia who are former chetniks , and contrary to your brainwashing tabloids , such things are on the fringe of the fringe here . 
  we do n't hate you , and if we hated you it would n't have been because we 're jealous of how great you are .
