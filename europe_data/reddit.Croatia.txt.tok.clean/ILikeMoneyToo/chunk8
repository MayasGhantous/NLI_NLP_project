  had to agree to the arbitration before being allowed into the eu . 
  basically exortion for territory , kind of . 
  croatia wanted to resolve the matter by using international law , but slovenia knew they 'd lose because they have no legal standing . 
  see guys , this is why i do n't like the whole `` it 's all the same language '' thing . 
  while technically it 's mostly true , it just always smells of this hegemonistic kind of denial of our own right to be who we are . 
  do n't worry about it , i think that to anyone paying attention it was pretty clear you were joking . 
  yeah , not by a long shot . 
  just because it 's now trendy to hate on turkey 's recent descend into ( maybe too harsh a word ) fanaticism , does n't mean you can just compare it to the ottoman empire . 
  i do n't see religiously motivated wars , people being forced to convert , expulsions of people , or christians and muslims paying different taxes , etc. 
  you 're just talking out of your ass . 
  yeah sure , children taken into slavery , forced religious conversion , no big deal , same as any empire ever ... oh wait . 
  the difference is that the terms under which the eu is designed to function have mutual immigration in mind , and when it comes to refugees , we 're seeing illegal crossing of borders en masse , with no documents , so that 's a false equivalence you 've got there and i 'm kind of sick of this being repeated around reddit as an attempt to showcase eastern hypocrisy when such a thing does n't truly exist as far as people have tried to make me see it . 
  oh yeah , i agree with you . 
  i do n't care about petty stuff like that greeting , nor do i have a need to think or talk about such distant past . 
  but since the question keeps being opened , i 'm just saying that i know why both sides feel the way they do and kind of wish people from both those idiotic camps would give it a rest and shut up . 
  they 're annoying and they 're both wrong to one or another degree . 
  i 'm referring to the `` moderate '' people on both sides of that discussion , not people who actually believe in fascism or communism ( aka idiots ) . 
  as for the whole question of history etc. , i have personal beliefs that affect my opinions like anyone else , but i do think that i can separate my ego from most things , and view things more or less objectively . 
  or at the very least be able to empathize ( read : understand , but not always agree ) with all sides of touchy issues , so i have no problem recognizing that it 's a good thing the allies won , while also acknowledging their warcrimes ( with emphasis on those against civilians ) , especially that of the russians where the crimes were state sponsored instead of crimes of individuals . 
  if anyone here 's listened to dan carlin 's `` ghosts of the ostfront '' podcast , basically i like his interpretation of the conflict which is weaved through the events he talks about . 
  as for the realpolitik thing , well sure , i think what germany did after wwii was good both on the morality level , as well as the political level because after performing such evils , being humble and changing ( as a nation , honestly i do n't believe individuals who commit atrocities can fundamentally change or at least should n't ever be given influence again ) is the only way to move on , and i could name examples of countries and conflicts which did not follow their good example . 
  so therefore , i agree with you that , were our country 's leadership and people smart , they 'd give it a freaking rest and stop obsessing about that bullshit . 
  and i think most people are doing that , but you 've got the clickbait media combined with a toxic culture of self-hatred in our country , and that 's a mixture that provides a lot of drama and international embarrassment for us . 
  i just ask please do n't interpret anything that i say as justifying fascists in any way as that 's not my intention . 
  i agree that we as a country have abysmal pr . 
  however , partisans did commit war crimes and i do n't think we should ignore that . 
  admitting their wrongdoings does n't mean they 're just as bad as nazi sympathisers ( i certainly do n't equate them ) , but i think the only civilized thing to do is not to idolize them either . 
  let 's just be satisfied that the nazis did n't win . 
  i do understand the people who felt that independence was a worthy goal , and it was , but the means also matter , and what the fascists did was beyond unacceptable . 
  i think everyone should be able to agree with the following : the fascists were the worst in the whole sad story and their crimes should not be justified by real or imaginary goals , partisans had a good goal but were n't saints and there was definitely scum among them ( not on the scale of russians in wwii but still ) , independence would 've been cool but we got there in the end through a righteous manner so let 's count our blessings , etc. 
  to your third point , there was indeed a puppet fascist regime in croatia , they definitely did evil stuff ( though it 's disputable who was more evil but eh ) . 
  however , a lot of croatians were also part of the resistance , so it was more of a civil war situation during wwii , though it might be fair to say that the pro nazi side was more official . 
  hey again folks , on the 27th of february at [ 7 pm gmt ] ( http://time.is/gmt ) we start our ** new eu4 campaign ** after finishing the last one . 
  the game , unlike last time , will last 4 hours per session because previously people said 5 hours was a bit much . 
  it 'll be ending at a more reasonable hour for most people which is a good thing . 
  anyways , you can drop off at any time before that . 
  no hard feelings !, 
  we only ask to please take a major nation only if you 're going to be sticking it out with us regularly , because major nations , at least at first , affect the balance of the game a lot and it 'll be more fun for everyone if they do n't get imploded by the ai . 
  * p.s. 
  no reason you ca n't become the most powerful starting from a minor nation - that actually happened in the last game . 
  * ** to join : ** [ this is / r/europe 's steam group ] ( http://steamcommunity.com/groups/europereddit ) . 
  it is open for anyone to join so you do n't even need an invitation . 
  there are two ways to join the actual game . 
  ** first way : ** once you are in , we can invite you , just remind us to in the steam group 's chat . 
  you can also directly join by clicking join game on someone already in the lobby that is also in the group chat . 
  ** second way : ** dakarans should be hosting , but you can send me ( the hound ) , arathian ( arathian ) or dakarans ( dakarans ) a friend invite and then you can join the game through us by : * entering eu4 and going into the multiplayer window ( if you were in single player , you need to restart eu4 ) * open your friends list where one of us is * click on that person 's profile * click join game button as pictured here [ friend profile ] ( http://i.imgur.com/oiyscji.png ) ** faq : ** * - do we use some sort of communication tool ? 
  * yes !, 
  for anything other than super secret plots ( for which we recommend eu4 's whisper functionality ) , we use teamspeak . 
  you do n't have to join it , but we strongly recommend it . 
  if you do n't know how to set it up , please ask . 
  the teamspeak server details are : address : 185.4.149.102:9152 room : eu4game password : europe ** - i did n't play last session/last week , can i join now ? 
  ** ** answer : ** absolutely !, 
  the usual rule is that you can also pick any nation unless someone played it previously , in which case , that someone has priority . 
  but if he is n't there when we play , you can take it for at least that session . 
  if an absentee going to be late to a session and do n't want to lose your nation please post in the weekly thread so we know you 'll be showing up . 
  if you give notice , you can miss ** one ** whole session and still have the right to your nation when you come back . 
  ** since this is a new game , we will be picking nations from scratch . 
  ** you can reserve a nation here in this thread , or you can simply pick what 's available when the game starts . 
  you can drop in at the last minute if you wish . 
  ** importantly ** - please choose one of the major nations only if you intend to show up every week . 
  ** - i can only join for 3 hours , not 4 , is that fine ? 
  ** ** answer : ** then join for 3 hours and leave before 4 . 
  that 's fine  ** - i came 10 minutes late and you have already started / i crashed / i got annexed and disconnected , what do ? 
  ** ** answer : ** we will be playing with a ton of people . 
  that means we unfortunately ca n't be restarting every time someone joins or disconnects . 
  we will be having 3 or so restarts total for everyone that came late or crashed to be able to rejoin , so it 's not the end of the world . 
  ** - i am bad at this game ** you are absolutely welcome !, 
  most of us were n't experienced players in the last game and we had a ton of fun with a lot of wars , plots , politics , etc. 
  ** - i have never played this game before ** you are also absolutely welcome but ... you probably wo n't enjoy this . 
  the game is super complicated and you wo n't understand most things and a 20-30 player game is usually a wild west mess so that would make it even harder to understand . 
  i would personally suggest skipping this week and trying the game in sp first - and then join us once you know at least some basics . 
  it is really fun !, 
  ** - my internet is trash , can i join anyway ? 
  ** ** answer : ** sure but ... your internet probably ca n't handle it if it 's really bad . 
  if you slow down the game too much , it 's not practical to participate . 
  however you can always try and see how it goes . 
   *************************** ** - rules ? 
  ** answer : last game we had only a surrender rule and no other rules which produced some weird situations , so we 've agreed to set up some basic ground rules : * ** we are limiting the number of player allies to 2 . 
  ** basically , what this means is that you can have at most 2 allies which are played by humans , but as many ai allies as you can get . 
  the reason for this is preventing unrealistically huge alliances which stifle the whole game because everyone 's too afraid to do anything . 
  we want to get a lot of smaller alliance blocks for greater diplomacy and tension !, 
  * ** if you 're in the top 6 score at the start of the session you 're limited to only 1 other top 6 score player as an ally . 
  ** these nations will be noted in a separate post in the thread before the start of each session . 
  for the first session they 'll stand as ( in no particular order ) : france , castille , austria , ottomans , england , lithuania ( or poland-lithuania if pu happens ) * ** after the first round , you are not allowed to pick a vassal or pu ( personal union ) of a player nation without the permission of that player . 
  ** you can pick one at the 1st round 's start though . 
  * ** you are allowed to play a player 's colonial nation ( i.e. 
  thirteen colonies in eastern america ) once those are created . 
  ** however , you are limited to two nations supporting your independence , and if you lose your independence war , you lose control of the colonial nation and it has to stay ai . 
  glory is there for those who seize the opportunity , but choose wisely !, 
  * ** try to be a sporting player . 
  ** this is more of a suggestion since this can hardly be enforced . 
  you are of course allowed ( and encouraged ) to declare war on whoever you think , and take what suits you and what you can conquer !, 
  do try and play fair ( ish ) at least , do n't deliberately gank people with like 5 separate alliances on your side , try not to gank someone completely at the very beginning of the game ( unless it 's like you 're castille and he 's navarra because that 's natural ) , etc. 
  feel free to plot and scheme with/against players though , it 's one of the most fun parts of the game !, 
  * ** no nation ruining . 
  ** if someone surrenders ( by saying ` i surrender ' in general chat ) , you have to offer them a peace deal at maximum 100 warscore . 
  taking more than 100 warscore per war is not allowed . 
  have fun !, 
  ** p.s. 
  feel free to ask any question regarding this mp game or eu4 in general in this thread or anywhere else .
