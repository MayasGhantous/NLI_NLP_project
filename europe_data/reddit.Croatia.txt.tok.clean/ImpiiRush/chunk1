bosnia is not a muslim country , christians are a majority . 
  violence and poverty there have nothing to do with religion . 
  region was already destabilized long before that . 
  croatian was called croatian back then too . 
  but in schools it was usually called `` croatian or serbian '' . 
  how did they manage to kill so many civilians ? 
  i mean , it 's not like they did it on purpose , right ? 
  plus they had endless resources and best available technology , yet the `` collateral damage '' was so high !, 
  if anyone else did something comparable it would undoubtedly be described as war crime . 
   why is it then whenever this issue about the wars is brought up , i never hear about slovenia ? 
  why did they stay out of it ? 
  slovenia did n't have homogeneous serbian communities , and it was never intended to be part of greater serbia . 
  that 's odd , because fla\u0161a is not even a serbian word and is also used in northern croatia . 
  we have something similar to # 2 : if grandma was a man , she would be called du\u0161ko - ( da je baba mu\u0161ko - zvala bi se du\u0161ko ), 
  1 and 4 are slightly different in croatian - praviti se englez - pretending to be english - gleda ko tele u \u0161arena vrata - staring like a calf at the colorful ( speckled ) door, 
  we have that in croatian as well . 
  \u0160pansko selo ( selo = village ) . 
  when i was in elementary school we had a physics teacher who often used that saying , and it always confused me because i lived in a suburb of zagreb called \u0160pansko so i asumed it was a joke about that neighborhood being a backwards village . 
  dispute is not about language , it 's about cyrillic script !, 
  you 're wrong . 
  croatia is both , as much as it pains me to admit it . 
  you wanted to know how is croatia central europe so i gave you an answer . 
  and we have n't become westernized , we were westernized , but now we 've became balkanized , sadly . 
  does this looks like albania to you ?!, 
  - [ vara\u017edin ] ( https://youtu.be/9n4ezkwv0yg ) - [ zagreb ] ( https://youtu.be/2xteau9q9t4 ) - [ samobor ] ( https://youtu.be/jensyycwu0o ), 
  perhaps , but i do n't think other divisions are necessarily antiquated . 
  5o years of cold war does n't erase 1000 years of history . 
  it 's silly to claim that czechia has more in common with azerbaijan than with germany , or that slovenia has more in common with moldova and russia than with austria . 
  it 's not anymore , but it used to be a quite obvious difference : - sarajevo : https://youtu.be/qew23bex13k - zagreb : https://youtu.be/jr6kpwbm6gg?t=6s, 
  what do greece and portugal have in common ? 
  is n't that something like half a glass of beer ? 
   however , propaganda exist in every war , on every sides , like you can see in this pretty funny example . 
  what 's funny is how easy it is to fool people when they want to be fooled : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nj8yuytlmk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=33m36s malagurski is a lying piece of shit, 
  i mentioned those cases because they demonstrate a clear pattern . 
  serbian leadership convinced it 's people that croats and bosniaks were the devil , they spoon fed them the doctrine of `` armed people '' saying that the army is the people , and people are the army , and they ordered them to retreat together with the army before the enemy even reached them . 
   sure you could just crush the rebel army like most regimes do . 
  but no , you had to kill/expel civilians . 
  can you give me a positive example of this ? 
   also , do you really , by your heart and mind , believe that 250 000 ** civilians just `` fled '' by their own free will , although they had behind their backs 130 000 soldiers of croatian army which , almost literally , killed all of that who remained . 
  they also fled sarajevo in winter of ' 95 / '96 in the exact same way . 
  their leaders them to leave so they loaded up their trucks and tractors , looted and burned houses and building , even dug up their dead , and left for serb controlled parts of bosnia even though there were no croatian soldiers in sight . 
  the same thing happened in western slavonia in november '91 after otkos 10 and in may '95 after operation flash and in march of '91 in eastern slavonia after all the fear mongering following the pakrac clash . 
  it 's the exact same modus operandi . 
  edit : found the video from sarajevo evacuation - https://youtu.be/qvrea7omuus, 
  brijuni transcripts confirm that the goal was to avoid civilian casualties . 
   `` to inflict such blows that the serbs will [ for ] all practical purposes disappear '' . 
  you 're quoting out of context . 
  the sentence continuous : '' , and that what we ca n't take at once must capitulate within a few days '' . 
  army capitulates ; he 's talking about the serbian army . 
  a few moments later he also says that their goal is to deal such blows that serbian forces can no longer recover and are forced to capitulate . 
  this is an unedited audio recording of that meeting : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0fbzkgmezm&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m14s and this is how the serbian media lies to you : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvsoiymw6wu&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18s not only did they deliberately cut the quote ( and added ominous music ) , but they also spliced the background audio to cover up the cut !, 
   `` human rights should be guaranteed publicly while at the same time , serbs should be shown a way out of krajina '' ... `` so in that way , to give them a road , while ostensibly guaranteeing them civil rights ' . 
  this is not an actual quote from tu\u0111man , but a misleading interpretation of words exchanged between minister of defense and president . 
  \u0160u\u0161ak is suggesting dropping flyers from a plane to increase the confusion among serbs . 
  tu\u0111man is using the word `` tobo\u017ee '' as buzz word ( po\u0161tapalica ) . 
  he 's saying that they should guarantee them alleged/supposed civil rights . 
  worst thing about it is that this is just the beginning . 
  in croatia , the poorer parts are often the safest and most welcoming !, 
  probably because we do n't have ghettos and street gangs . 
  cunts indeed . 
  many books have been written about their scummy behavior during the 90 's . 
  i would n't say germany armed croatia , and it certainly did n't donate any guns . 
  if there was any smuggling it was probably thanks to croatian diaspora there . 
  germany 's help is mostly seen in recognizing croatia and slovenia , but even that came in 1992 , after months of fierce combat . 
  they also sent humanitarian aid . 
  but only for male children , right ? 
  because cutting of your daughters clitoral hood would be barbaric . 
  what about medical professionals outside of america ? 
  most americans do it for non religious reasons and a common argument is that it looks better . 
  there are multiple types of female circumcision , some of them less destructive than standard male circumcision . 
  would you be willing to cut off your daughters clitoral hood because it looks nicer and is `` really not a big deal '' ? 
  sarajevo : https://youtu.be/qew23bex13k zagreb : https://youtu.be/jr6kpwbm6gg?t=6s can you tell a difference ? 
  btw , what about slovenes ? 
  are they also members of our happy club ? 
  they share the same origin as croats , they 're catholic , and slovenian is mutually intelligible with kaykavian croatian . 
  i would always use croatian in serbia , bosnia & herzegovina and montenegro . 
  in slovenia and macedonia i might switch to english , but it 's not likely . 
  in any case , i would never start a conversation in english , that would be weird and it could offend people . 
  i was in czechia once , and at first i tried using english when asking for directions and in stores , but i quickly realized that more people understand me when i speak croatian !, 
  unfortunately , having a normal conversation with czechs and slovaks is not possible without practice , but basic communication is surprisingly easy . 
  ( it 's also easy to unintentionally compliment their grandmas pussy and call their girlfriend a whore due to a long list of false friends :d ) in poland i would want to use english , but if i had no choice i could get by using croatian . 
  it would n't be pretty though . 
  bulgarian is pure gibberish to me . 
  in belarus , ukraine and russia i would n't bother using croatian . 
  it would just take too much time and effort . 
  if i wanted to make myself understood , i would have to repeat the same sentence using different words until i hit the right combination . 
  for example , the croatian word for clock/watch/hour is `` sat '' , but that word does n't exist in russian . 
  the second word for clock is `` ura '' or `` vura '' , which is of germanic origin ( i think ) , so that would n't work either . 
  the third word is '' \u010das '' and in croatian it means `` moment '' , but in serbian it still means watch/hour , and everyone in croatia would recognize it . 
  if you knew such things you could precisely chose the right words in a way that would make them understandable to every slavic speaker . 
  if you want to know more take a look at this constructed slavic language : http://www.slovio.com/, 
  in this short example i can understand most of it , but usually i can only follow about 60 % , and i often get completely lost . 
  i understand it better than slovakian but much worse than slovenian , which is interesting because macedonian vocabulary appears to be closer to croatian . 
  it sounds like a foreigner is attempting to speak croatian but is failing horribly . 
  the lack of grammatical case makes me think that the speaker is not very intelligent . 
  sorry if that sounds harsh . 
  of course he could . 
  why are you talking to a troll ? 
  `` kill !,
