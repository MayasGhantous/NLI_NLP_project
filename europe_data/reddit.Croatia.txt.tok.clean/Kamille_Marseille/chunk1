i live near slovenia and i have no complaints . 
  border regime is so relaxed , you do n't need a passport , you can cross the border with id card . 
  before when passport was needed if you would frequently cross the border your pasport would be filled with stamps and you would need to go to police station and pay for a new one and that was tedious . 
  til that cymru is the welsh word for wales . 
  i think croatia is marked with `` d - product not strictly according to the deffinition '' for cinema tickets prices because the price is not the same for everyone . 
  last year i used my student id for a dicount , [ ( 1 ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ylj618b.jpg?1 ) [ ( 2 ) ] ( http://i.imgur.com/juorcuc.jpg?1 ) so [ vat ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/croatia/sales-tax-rate ) on the price was 5 % instead 25 % . 
  24 hrk is 3.15 $ . 
  i think this is what is strange for eurostat . 
  and also in [ 2013 vat % was changed for cinema tickets ] ( http://www.novilist.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/linic-popustio-pdv-na-ulaznice-za-koncerte-deset-posto ) so this also complicates things for eurostat . 
  2014 and no montenegro , a country that is indipendent from 2006 and is [ widely recognized ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foreign_relations_of_montenegro#mediaviewer/file:montenegro_relations.png ) . 
  montenegro is a member of the un and is not on a map made by un . 
  because 100 $ is not the same in norway and in croatia . 
  when someone from norway visits croatia they say that everything here is cheaper then back home . 
  when someone from croatia visits norway they say how everything is so expensive over there . 
  for the same amount of money , for example 100 $ you could buy more food in a grocery store in croatia then you could in norway . 
  for better comparison you should use gdp with adjusted purchasing power . 
  game of thrones then ? 
  dubrovnik is ungrazed . 
  you will have a nice holiday in dubrovnik . 
  croatia did n't vote to criminalize gay marriage , croatia voted to have constitutional definition of marriage . 
  which is also retarded . 
  this means you are [ forbidden ] ( http://translate.google.hr/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=hr&amp;u=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/hrvatska/tabid/66/articletype/articleview/articleid/254834/default.aspx&amp;prev=/search%3fq%3dprotiv%2bmedija%2bkoji%2bkoriste%2btermin%2bgej%2bbrak%26client%3dubuntu%26hs%3d76x%26channel%3dfs ) to call gay marriage a merriage because by constituion only heterosexual merriage is merriage . 
  so equivalent term of gay marrige that is legal to use is [ civil union . 
  ] ( http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/croatia-registers-first-gay-civil-union-after-gay-marriage-ban070914 ) problem for anti-gay groups is that evryone calls civil unions gay marriage , which is forbidden , but there are no sanctions for calling it gay marriage . 
  [ on positive note , things are better then they used to be . 
  ] ( http://www.winq.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ilga-europe-1.png ), 
  also slovenia . 
  i used to live there for 2 years when i a kid during the war . 
  hr = hrvatska , croatia in croatian, 
  not if they go turkey --  greece --  italy --  austria and bypass bulgaria , serbia , hungary , and slovenia . 
  the title is ; new details about slavonian penis collector ` why did you report him , do you want this man to lose his job ? ', 
  [ if you have any doubts , i assure you the story is real . 
  i think only good things about slovenia . 
  i think slovena is 10 years ahead of us . 
  op this is for [ you ] ( http://www.egafd.com/ ) . 
  you are right , official speed limit is 130 km/h , but due to legal requirements for speed mesurment * de facto * speed limit is higher . 
  lawmakers were worried that speed mesurment is not 100 % accurate and to compensate errors in mesurament you can drive 10 km/h faster if the speed limit is under 100 km/h and 10 % faster if the speed limit over 100 km/h . 
  so when speed limit is 60 km/h you can drive 70 km/h and when the speed limit is 130 km/h you can drive 143 km/h . 
  this is how they got the 140 km/h speed limit . 
  [ morocco was rejected for the very same reason . 
  ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/morocco%e2%80%93european_union_relations#membership_application )  morocco applied to join the then-european communities on 20 july 1987 . 
  the application was rejected by community foreign ministers as they did not consider morocco to be a european country and hence could not join . 
  the rejection was expected as the king had sent feelers two years prior who received such a response . 
  [ no , they will be rejected like morocco .

  they use [ robots and heavy machinery ] ( http://www.dok-ing.hr/ ) to go first , but then humans must go and check everything one more time . 
  also robots and heavy machinery can not be used inside buildings , they are to big for forests , and they can not clear threnches , so humans have to do this job .

  this makes me sad . 
  they know better than that , all construction is prohibited , place is a national park and an unesco world heritage site . 
   bosnia and herzegovina for obvious reasons . 
  what are the obvious reasons ? 
  nah , [ horned viper ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vipera_ammodytes ) is the most dangerous animal in croatia . 
  unlike lynx this animal actally kills people regularly . 
   football fans of / r/europe - is it common for people in your country to have a favorite foreign team as well ? 
  it is very common . 
  more people in croatia follows foreign leagues then the croatian national league ( 1 . hnl ) . 
  i remember when i was in elementary school every tuesday kids would talk about tv show petica , nobody would talk about 1 . hnl . 
  petica was a tv show that would show all the goals and good goal attempts from top five european leagues . 
  people will cheer for every good foreign team that has croatian players . 
  but their favorite foreign team was one they picked as kids , usually that team was among the very best that year . 
  my friend started following football the same year ( 95 ' / 96 ' season ) fc juventus won champions league , juve was his favorite team ever since .

  -------------------------------------- ex president of republic of croatia ( rh ) stjepan mesi\u0107 apologized in 2003 . 
  [ here ] ( http://translate.google.hr/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=hr&amp;u=http://www.poslovni.hr/hrvatska/kronologija-predsjednickih-isprika-na-prostoru-bivse-jugoslavije-238902&amp;prev=search ) is the list of all apologies of all leaders of countries that came to existence after dissolution of yugoslavia . 
  user * crnaruka * is known troll who re-edits his comments , this is the [ comment ] ( http://i.imgur.com/tzjilgk.png?1 ) i have responded to , just in case he re-edits his comment again . 
   crnkovic-pavenka says he 's experienced just one life-threatening event in 13 years ' work at the sanctuary , when rescuing a german volunteer who had wandered into an enclosure and started serenading the bears by guitar . 
  the german was bitten but suffered no serious wounds , and the bear had to be shot to rescue crnkovic-pavenka . 
  wtf , why would you think serenading a bear is a good idea . 
  i think that map is wrong , you should go to the museum anyway . 
  who knows , maybe they are on public display . 
  [ apollo 11 ] ( http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_apollo11.html ) and [ 17 ] ( http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_goodwill.html ) moon rocks , the * goodwill moon rock * are in museum of yugoslav history in belgrade . 
  but can you realy visit them , according to map , moon rocks in serbia are [ * hidden in drawer and not displayed * ] ( http://i.imgur.com/elibgmf.png ) . 
  yugslavia received [ apollo 11 ] ( http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_apollo11.html ) and [ 17 ] ( http://www.collectspace.com/resources/moonrocks_goodwill.html ) moon rocks . 
  they are now in museum of yugoslav history in belgrade , serbia . 
  no , it wo n't . 
   goodwill moon rock [ 1 ] vs boring basic moon rock [ 2 ] then i guess the rock in zagreb is the * boring basic moon rock * . 
  because this was before croatia existed , flag of the * godwil moon rock * would be the flag of yugoslavia , so that artifact would be inherited by serbia . 
  if i remember correctly , there was no flag . 
  there was a grain of dust between 2 small sheets of glass and a magnifying glass over it , on the side there was a small plaque with description stating that this moon rock was brought to earth by crew of apollo ( i do n't know the number ) and that this was a gift from usa . 
  because croatia was part of [ yugoslavia ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslavia ) and the capital of yugoslavia was belgrade , maybe the flag is there . 
  there is one in zagreb . 
  i guess there must be one in belgrade also . 
  i do n't understand your question .
