damn krampus had some good , heavy , chains with which he rattled while st. nick stuffed boots with presents in other room ... or so i 've been told . 
  lol , trabant !, 
  that 's his default face though . 
  even if they did , they would n't leave - alive . 
  i think the same . 
  it\u0107s one thing to talk about something with your friends and giving an opinion to a poll and a whole other thing making a decision when reality checks in in a voting booth . 
  that 's why i do n't trust polls in these cases . 
  yeah , that was a bit of a poor word choice on my part . 
  exciting as in turbulent was what i meant . 
  we only know what various polls are telling us , which may or may not be true . 
  referendum alone is a spark for a lot of negativity though , on both sides . 
  ca n't wait thursday to see the outcome . 
  exciting times for scotland and uk , and eu . 
   they do n't want to stay with you we do n't know that - until thursday . 
  not really surprising to be honest . 
  that 's what 's bothering me the most . 
  meh reaction is the worst outcome . 
  germans and uk guys covered most of stuff we use already . 
  one other notable example would be digitron for pocket calculators , named after local company which made them first . 
  always thought it was a cool name . 
  manner alone saves the day . 
  mountains !, 
  not so much as istria . 
  on the other hand whole of king 's landing in game of thrones is shot in dubrovnik . 
  king 's landing is dubrovnik . 
  how could you not include [ bern ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bvtiues.jpg ) ? 
  dubrovnik city walls . 
  it runs around the old town and walls of ston ( around 7km in length , but rather boring  ), 
  well , sea makes everything better - that is true . 
  tbh some of these places , photos just do n't do them justice . 
  for example kornati . 
  you just have to see it in person . 
  it 's really beautiful . 
  i 'm not saying that just because i 'm from croatia . 
  there are more scenic places in the world . 
  dat se asia for example . . damn !, 
  in no particular order . 
  [ dubrovnik ] ( http://i.imgur.com/923trfs.jpg ) old city of dubrovnik , a unesco world heritage site . 
  most southern island of the larger islands in croatia . 
  [ krka ] ( http://i.imgur.com/czlhgpc.jpg ) krka national park , based around river krka . 
  [ pula amphitheater ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mvypn7l.jpg ) pula amphitheater , still around from roman times . 
  nowadays it 's used for concerts and a an annual film festival . 
  ** bonus 8th : ** 25 % value added tax combined with high unemployment many may more natural wonders . 
  this just barely scratches the surface and is mostly in southern part of croatia which people recognize the most . 
  ah , yes . 
  france and wolves !, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beast_of_g%c3%a9vaudan http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolves_of_paris http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolf_of_soissons http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolf_of_sarlat http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolves_of_p%c3%a9rigord see how many french incidents there are : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_fatal_wolf_attacks http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:map_of_wolf_attacks_on_humans_in_france_with_text.png edit : do n't go to france or you 'll get eaten by wolves !, 
  bonus is that ` the federation ' can sound both benign and ominous at the same time . 
  can you translate those ? 
  are they even the same title as in original , only translated ? 
  come here , over the border . 
  roads here are really good , toll is a bit on the expensive side though . 
  jesus christ , that video is insane !, 
  badminton is one of the toughest sports you can play out there recreationally . 
  shit is hard , yo . 
   poland too had `` allies '' when the ww2 started . 
  and that 's why nato got started after ww2 . 
  17.3.1948 . with treaty of brussels . 
   tell you more - nobody would do anything if russia attacked poland , the baltics , czech republic etc. 
  that 's just the reality . 
  not really : http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/nato_countries.htm attacking any of these countries would be a suicide mission for russia on many , many levels . 
  peaceful separation this time around !, 
  that 's the plan . 
  also , mass execution of privatization gang in advance of their crimes . 
  does n't feel complete without [ jahorina ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jahorina ) , [ \u0160ar mountains ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%c5%a0ar_mountains ) and especially [ prokletije ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prokletije ) . 
  also check out [ tara river canyon ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tara_river_canyon ) . 
  we 'd come , but we 're lazy . 
  so , maybe next week or something ? 
  * jean giraud moebius * french have awesome cartoons and strong animation history and culture, 
  there 's so much more to bosnia and herzegovina 's nature . 
  vrbas canyon , peru\u0107ica rainforest , jahorina and bjela\u0161nica mountains , vla\u0161i\u0107 mountain , etc. . a really long list of beautiful landscapes . 
  sachertorte is more than enough !, 
  the region as a whole is heavily into kn\u00f6dels , but austria is kind of known for kn\u00f6dels . 
  i watched a mid-week morning documentary about a month ago made in austria by orf i think - it was only about kn\u00f6dels and how it relates to their culinary identity . 
  true though , germkn\u00f6dels are mostly recognizable as a delicacy you get to eat while on skiing . 
  son , i am dissapoint you have n't mentioned germkn\u00f6dels . 
  speaking for croatia , we both like ` only fools and horses ' - so there 's that . 
  holy crap !, 
  terrifying . 
  rest in peace poor people . 
  right , nothing guarantees your data wo n't pass through us . 
  finally something we can represent europe in and be world champions while at it !, 
  as of 1st july , 2013. , exchange rate is 1 irish girl : 1 croatian girl . 
  tell us when and where the exchange will take place !, 
  damn those german shepherds !, 
  i had one , rest in peace , he regularly switched our tv channels to german ones in our house once he sneaked in . 
  it was his silent act of uprising . 
  nicely said , i 'll steal your words for possible future use . 
  that does n't sound very , ehm , scientific . 
  actual , credible , quotes are hard to find . 
  i do n't know why people downvote you though - it 's what you heard , does n't make it true or false , just that your source is n't credible . 
  i 'd love to see sources on those quotes  only quote i know that is related to this , and is of questionable source ( supposedly via telegram in 1936 ) : `` i am equally proud of my serbian origin and croatian fatherland . 
  long live all yugoslavs ! '' . 
  quote seems out of character for a man like that . 
  if you separate people by blood , then quite possibly yes . 
  i 'm quite sure my great grandparents were french - i do n't see myself as a french . 
  who knows where my ancestors before that were from , possibly from africa . 
  where does it stop ? 
  it 's a silly premise , in modern globalized world especially . 
  indeed , a guy with serbian heritage , born in today croatia , that was in serbia once for 3 hours or 3 days ( ca n't remember ) , schooled in croatia and austria - and before all , a guy that everything that he accomplished was made possible to him in us of a where he lived and worked most of his life .
