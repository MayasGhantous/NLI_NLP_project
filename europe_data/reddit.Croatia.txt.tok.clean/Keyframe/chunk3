  if i 've learned one thing when hanging out with italians then it 's that italians love their discount !, 
  croatia implemented fiscalization of receipts ~ 2 + years ago . 
  it 's a software solution : http://www.fiscalization.hr/en/fiscal-procedures/about-the-procedure the gist of it is that each receipt is registered with central tax office while it 's made ( there is some special case where if connection from point of sale to tax office is not working , then it has a slight delay ) . 
  you can check , for yourself , each and every receipt online at tax authority site if it 's valid . 
  there were ( is ) some lottery type of thing as well based on unique ids of receipts , so people were even more inclined to pick up their receipts ( they did before though ) . 
  suddenly , all of the catering service industry reports a 30 % + increase in revenue next year . 
  there were cases where people tried to game that system as well , but it did n't last for long . 
  basically , if people left their receipts after they left , some bar owners kept those receipts and tried to give them out to new customers ( if items on receipts matched ) . 
  around whom though ? 
  the people of greece or eu creditors ? 
  [ maybe both ? 
  or use steam back-end for a summer sale . 
  so , are we the chorus ? 
   the chorus in classical greek drama was a group of actors who described and commented upon the main action of a play with song , dance , and recitation . 
  well , no need for a finance minister if there 's no more finances . 
  seriously though , what kind of message is that from the government ? 
  we will take a stand right here , the people of greece !, 
  and then , if they ask us , we will resign ? 
  tbh quoted ^ 1 source says ` debt default or restructuring ' [ 1 ] http://www.nber.org/papers/w13946.pdf, 
  you do n't get rich by paying 2.2 $ / minute . 
  iceland has a population of a small ( ish ) city and is very specific . 
  hope for the best for greece !, 
  interesting times ahead . 
   an extra few billion wo n't be noticeable . 
  care to elaborate ? 
  i ca n't seem to find the reference and my french history is limited to high school and asterix . 
  that 's actually [ quite hilarious ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/flag_of_wallonia.svg ) when you think about it . 
  til, 
  why are you hating on cocoric\u00f3 ? 
   how come we only hear about coffees that cost 7 $ on stradun ? 
  have you been to dubrovnik ? 
  only place that 's expensive is stradun , and most expensive there is $ 7-8 for both coffee and coke . 
  have n't seen $ 7 coffee anywhere . 
  everywhere else , apart from stradun , prices are in normal range . 
  i 've even seen moderately normal prices on stradun itself too . 
  to get from stradun to normal is a 30 meter walk in either direction . 
  near the old city market are the lowest prices . 
  most expensive coffee ( since we 're using that as a measure of unit ) is not on stradun though - it 's in a coffee shop at the top of the cable car on sr\u0111 . 
  dubrovnik is affordable and full of local people that are n't rich , not even close . 
   everything in dubrovnik is overpriced . 
  not true at all . 
  most of people there live like everywhere else in croatia , same wages , same problems . 
  for example , if you go to almost any street next to stradun , you can get coffee for 7-10 kn ( cheaper than zagreb ) . 
  in fact , almost everywhere except stradun itself prices are lower than zg . 
  old city is a small part of dubrovnik too . 
  very pretty girls !, 
  there 's that . 
  tbh you pay for a card ( 180 kn i think ) that lets you into almost all city museums , city walls , and serves as a city bus ticket - all in one for a day . 
  there 's a multi-day pass as well . 
  not all that expensive then . 
  dubrovnik cable car , on the other hand , is a different story . 
  sacr\u00e9 blue !, 
  that 's , indeed , how spins work . 
  for example , imagine a scenario when wikileaks got out with material . 
  imagine if response from us government was something like : `` yes , some of those are indeed real '' , and not all . 
  i agree , because our history is all about conquering serbia . 
  considering your recent history , it would be a surprise if there were n't any interest . 
  tried some for croatia , here are the results : * maksim mrvica croatian rhapsody * croatia belongs to which continent ? 
  * croatia travel * why croatia to bosnia only a crowded sea ? 
  what historical reasons which ? 
  * croatia why not firing a single shot can be merged in russia ? 
  ( huh ? ), 
  * [ croatia impression ] croatia how , in croatia there is nothing fun to do ... clean water ... the coast long , cheap ... orange paradise ( ?? ), 
  * croatia why monopolized most of the former yugoslav coastline * why the serbs always croatia bullied seems legit, 
  there 's a bank holiday tomorrow though . 
  ^ i ^ know , ^ i ^ know, 
   so when 4 years later nato started bombing serbia it felt good for a moment , like they had it coming . 
   but the feeling lasted for maybe a minute . 
  i remember becoming rather sad as i knew that ordinary people would suffer and the real bastards will be safe . 
  exactly the same feeling , and i was in the military at the time ( conscription , yaay :( ) . 
   are you referring to this event ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zagreb_rocket_attacks i do n't know of other air attacks so this one pretty much fits . 
  it was the very first air raid siren we had . 
  i do n't know the exact date , but definitely second half of '91 or early ' 92 ... 
  i looked it up . 
  it was 14.09.1991 . 
  it was a common occurrence , though nothing major like in other cities that were actually attacked all the time ( like vukovar , osijek , dubrovnik , etc. ) . 
  of the most prominent attacks there was this one you 've mentioned ( i was actually rather close to where one hit , but that 's another story ) , then this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_banski_dvori and this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zagreb_tv_tower and several smaller ones , mainly during this : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_barracks there was also a sabotage in the military munition storage and the resulting cloud from the explosion could be seen from almost all of the city . 
  i remember one other anecdote from those early days . 
  my dad was a doctor and was on duty all the time during those early days ( he 's retired now ) . 
  during one of the air raids we were spending the night in the basement with other neighbours . 
  we were sleeping and so was my dad who was on duty before that for two days straight . 
  he woke up and went outside to see what 's going on . 
  it was the middle of the night . 
  we lived relatively close to two military establishments , which were by then in our hands . 
  and as he went out , there was this helicopter above our house ( our house and the neighbour 's one are joined , they share a wall . 
  i forgot the english term for that now ) . 
  that helicopter was shooting at one of the barracks that was maybe a kilometer or so from our house . 
  dad went back inside , in panic , stating that the enemy has some sort of new weapon and we 're as good as dead . 
  that weapon were tracer bullets ( it was night , after all ) . 
  we laughed at him and then with him ... while helicopter above us was shooting . 
  strange times . 
  there was this time also when i went , also at night , to our garden to catch some fresh air and i turned around and saw rocket flares above the same barracks . 
  as if they were just there - standing in the air . 
  i ca n't explain it . 
  good 15 minutes later or so there was a siren . 
  again . 
  over time people adjusted so much that most did n't even bother to go to shelters . 
  this was in zagreb , after all . 
  we saw very few of situations like these , unlike other parts of our country .
