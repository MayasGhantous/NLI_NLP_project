  for example , for id card , in croatia we say * osobna iskaznica * or just * osobna * . 
  in bosnia and serbia , they say * li\u010dna karta * . 
  we use * lako * for easy and simple . 
  * prosto * is on bosnian , * ne komplikovano * is on serbian . 
  i 've never heard anyone say * prosto * and * ne komplikovano * in croatia . 
  in croatian , * kino * .

  for example , * jedno , drugo , tre\u0107e * ( first , second , third ) . 
  that 's * ji\u01cen * on latinic alphabet so 4 letters also . 
  in croatian you can also say * lako * .

  yes !, 
  i still have asterix and obelix game for ps1 somewhere . 
  before `` removed '' tag , there was tag `` in 1994 ... '' . 
  only moderators can add tags which means that someone of moderators actually saw post and did n't removed it . 
  i do n't want to blame anyone and i do n't have nothing against moderators . 
   fact # 2 : slovenia is the smallest country , both by population ( 2 million ) and land area ( 20,273 km \u00b2 ; 7,827 sq mi ) , to have nuclear power . 
  we do n't have any nuclear power stations in our country so we share one with slovenia . 
  each country owns 50 % and gets 50 % energy from it . 
  ask anyone ... 
  ask anyone ... 
   what are the other differences , if i may ask ? 
  history , grammar , some words ... 
  i 've never heard for that either . 
  lol . 
  i guess i could try ... 
   so people started taking the piss out of them by coming up with ridiculous words like `` zrakoplovno mlataralo '' . 
  i never heard anyone say `` zrakoplovno mlataralo '' . 
  i 'm not telling them how to write . 
  i 'm just saying what i found on wikipedia . 
  i 'm not reading sites , articles , documents in cyrillic so i do n't need to know it . 
  if i need to read something in cyrillic , i 'm using google translate to transliterate it . 
  english is spoken literally everywhere and i 'm using it often . 
  it 's always good to know another language . 
  why would i learn cyrillic alphabet if we 're not using it ? 
  according to [ ustav republike srbije ] ( http://www.ustavni.sud.rs/page/view/sr-latn-cs/70-100028/ustav-republike-srbije ) , official language is serbian with cyrillic alphabet . 
  well , look at it this way - croatian is written in latinic alphabet , serbian in cyrillic . 
  that 's just one difference why every country has their own language and why they are separate languages . 
  both , american and british , write in latinic alphabet and they can understand each other when speaking and writing . 
  i can understand serbs when they are speaking , of course but i ca n't understand them if they write in cyrillic alphabet . 
  ` slava ' means ` fame ' in croatian as well .
