  well , sije\u010danj is 1st month in croatian . 
  croatian , bosnian and serbian are standards of serbo-croatian which was spoken in yugoslavia . 
  because yugoslavia does n't exist anymore , no one speaks serbo-croatian . 
  croatian , bosnian and serbian are recognized as three separated languages . 
  we 're special ... 
  most of croats can understand slovenian , especially people from northern croatia where [ kajkavian language ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kajkavian ) is spoken . 
  people from other regions of croatia can understand slovenian as well but a little harder and if they speak slowly . 
  there are a lot of words same or similar to croatian ones . 
  i can understand slovenian enough to watch movies and tv series on their television but i do n't speak slovenian . 
  i hope that they 'll make croatia second video . 
   though their new year 's special from a year ago was quite funny , so they could do it if they try hard enough . 
  i remember that . 
  it was really funny but episodes after not that much . 
  : / have you watched news bar prime time # 27 year review ? 
  it 's really funny . 
  prime time is better than montirani proces . 
  we have evening show , news bar prime time . 
  it 's on n1 every sunday at 20h and on youtube at 20:30 h. 
  someone needs to send them this . 
  the last part ( 4:44 ) .

  i did n't know there was a competition . 
  nice . 
  thanks for explanation . 
  do n't forget croatia . 
  and you 're complaining that you do n't have snow ... 
  last one was m5 .2 . 
  according to emsc it was felt in pazin and rijeka as well . 
  i remember last year when earthquakes m6 .1 and m6 .7 hit the italy , we felt them here as well . 
  hope everyone is safe . 
  you forgot pizza !, 
  awesome !, 
  prosinac is name for december in croatian . 
  same is in croatian . 
  :d http://meteoalarm.eu/index2.php?lang=en_uk&amp;day=1&amp;at=0&amp;country=hr, 
  maybe . 
  do n't complain . 
  -10 \u00b0 c is here . 
  in pdf , we trust tv , radio , written press , partially the internet but we do n't trust social networks . 
  slovenia does n't have trust in anything . 
  could you live in zadar then ? 
  here is video from yesterday . 
  :d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt2eigo38ue, 
  we have actually a lot of channels on tv due to geography of our country . 
  i can recieve all channels available in my region ( [ here is list of region and channels ] ( http://www.oiv.hr/broadcasting/tables/dtv_channel_hr.aspx ) ) and 24 channels from neighbouring countries . 
  great thing is that i can watch their channels without having problems with understanding . 
  also , they add subtitles on every tv programme ( except cartoons ) like we do so even if i did n't understand a word , i can still understand everything because there is english audio . 
  people on coast can watch italian tv and a lot of people can actually understand the language . 
   when portugal switched to dtt a lot of people also went crazy over it saying they would be forced to purchase set-top boxes/tvs/etc just to watch free tv and that the elderly would suffer from it . 
  same was in croatia but at least our goverment ( or national television ) sent vouchers to every household so we had discounts on these boxes . 
   fast forward a few years later and almost nobody cares about it anymore even though the service is actually shittier than before ( before , a loss of signal meant a little static on the tv but now a loss of signal means the image and sound gets all corrupted and pretty much unwatchable ) in croatia , a lot of people is mad because we do n't have any hd channels on dvb-t . slovenia , for example , has two hd channels . 
  the explanation for not having hd is that we do n't have space in dvb-t . slovenia uses same standard and has 6 channels on one multiplex of which are 2 hd but we can only have 4 sd . 
  a lot of people is actually watching sport on slovenian television because there is better picture or that sport is n't available on our tv . 
  people living on coast are mad for different reason ; they ca n't watch terrestrial tv or listen radio because of interference coming from italy . 
  instead they have to pay for iptv or cable tv . 
  however , recently is announced that italy agreed to reduce signal so there would n't be interference . 
  also , last year it was announced that we 're going to switch to dvb-t2 hevc in 2019 . so we will probably have to purchase new tvs or stb devices . 
  we do n't have dab and we can only dream about it . 
  i do n't know . 
  someone shoud create map for that . 
  i know who ca n't - this elevator . 
  i feel sorry for italy . 
  these two languages are similar ( due to geographical proximity ) , not the same because every have it 's own vocabulary , grammar , dialects and history . 
  merry christmas neighbours !, 
  the only thing i do n't understand is how `` corruption '' affects civil safety . 
  zagreb , croatia -- like zagreb 's other major eastern european counterparts , corruption drags the city down -- it ranked 79th . 
  dalmatian christmas tree looks exactly the same . 
  unfortunately they ca n't use tor because it 's blocked . 
  most of vpns are blocked too .

  so nothing new . 
  awesome !, 
  i do n't know , probably yesterday . 
  this is post from / r/croatia . 
  photos were uploaded by / u/kobilasuzi . 
  on news they said that there is approx . 
  150 books available on croatian . 
  there are approx . 
  150 books available on croatian . 
  there are also books that are available on english and several other languages . 
  books are available on several languages . 
  they also said that they are collaborating with best publishers . 
  i know croatian , bosnian , serbian and english . 
  also , i do n't speak but i can understand slovenian , macedonian , bulgarian and other slavic languages if they are spoken slowly . 
  for example , if i go to slovenia , i can talk on croatian and people will understand me and if they speak on slovenian , i can understand them . 
  people who live in istria and dalmatia can understand italian too . 
  i 'm still waiting snow . 
  even though we do n't speak slovenian , macedonian , bulgarian , polish , czech and other slavic languages , we can actually understand each other and hold basic conversation . 
  however , we would need to speak slowly but we could still understand each other . 
  we have elementary school ( osnovna \u0161kola ) which has 8 grades . 
  after that , students go to secondary school ( srednja \u0161kola ) and there are three types ( gymnasiums - gimnazije , vocational schools - strukovne \u0161kole and art schools - umjetni\u010dke \u0161kole ) . 
  gymnasiums are really hard so most of students select to go to vocational schools which are much easier . 
  after finishing gymnasium , students have to go to university . 
  on the other hand , students which have finished vocational school do n't have to go to university but they can if they want to .
