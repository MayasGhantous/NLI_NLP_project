  is n't that only for minorities who are in croatia ? 
  i do n't think that croats can learn serbian , bosnian and montenegrin . 
  and why learn these languages if we can understand them ? 
    in bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , montenegro , serbia and macedonia , latin is also a mandatory subject in all gymnasiums , just as ancient greek is , with latin , in a certain type of gymnasiums called classical gymnasiums ( klasi\u010dna gimnazija ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gymnasium_ ( school ) #former _ yugoslavia, 
  here in croatia , croatian and english are mandatory subjects . 
  in gymnasiums , latin is also mandatory subject . 
  students can also choose to learn german , french , italian and some other languages ( not sure which ) if they want . 
  also , public transport is ** free every weekend ** until 8.1.2017 . 
  free public transport starts every ** friday at 12:00 h ** and lasts until ** sunday at 0:00 h ** . 
  rides with funicular are free every day ( until 8.1.2017 . , of course ) . 
  enjoy your stay in zagreb . 
  i love reading comments . 
  there 's always drama . 
  i 've been waiting this episode . 
  thanks for letting me know . 
  i searched / r/europe and checked `` new '' section and article was n't there . 
  now i can see the article . 
  thanks again . 
  i believe it 's prohibited on croatian side also . 
  i thought that there are more episodes per season but now i see that there is only 10 episodes per season . 
  lol !, 
  i thought they 're gon na collapse . 
  that 's not a ** mobile network ** . 
  we 're talking about mobile internet here . 
  which mobile network ? 
  looks awesome !, 
  good job !, 
  i ca n't belive that data in canada is so expensive . 
   tethering has a 30gb cap per month there 's a catch . 
  that 's ok i guess . 
  i can barely use 1 gb of 2 gb data that i have . 
  is tethering enabled on network ? 
  same here in croatia . 
  however , hrvatski telekom ( croatian telecom ) has option that is called internet dan ( internet day ) which you can buy and have a really flat internet but only for a day so you have to reactivate it every 24 hours . 
  price is 2 $ and i think that only prepaid users can activate it . 
  ** question for people from countries with unlimited mobile internet : ** is it really flat or is it something like 5 gb with maximal speed and after that unlimited with 64 kb/s speed ? 
  daily news podcast from radio and tv on english language .

  croatian news sources on wiki page are outdated .

  why would n't they if they can ? 
  they published a picture recently of a little boat they have . 
   most people look forward to their holidays . 
  however , as newly released data from eurostat demonstrates , 1 in 3 europeans can not afford spending an annual one-week leave away from home . 
  this number was highest in romania where 66.6 percent of the general population can not afford domestic holidays or travels abroad . 
  croatia is in second place with 62.8 percent . 
  in norway however , most people can afford holidays away from home , while only 6 percent can not . 
  the swedes are in a similar position with around 8 percent being unable to afford one week off a year . 
   nevertheless , the proportion of those spending their holidays someplace else than home decreased in all eu member states except cyprus , denmark and greece which are not listed in the graphic .

   after the shock decision in the uk to leave the european union last year , groups in a number of other countries have upped their efforts to push for an exit , too . 
  pretty much any possible country + exit portmanteau has been touted at some point - nexit , frexit , even the not so catchy itexit . 
  one country though , despite a ( heavily disputed ) recommendation to the contrary , has shown little appetite for such a move : ireland . 
   uk think tank policy exchange argued in its 3 july 2017 report that `` ireland 's interests would be better served by opting out of formal membership of the eu , remaining in a customs union with the uk and negotiating free trade arrangements '' , arguing that it would be a `` dereliction of national duty '' not to evaluate all of the options available to the country , especially given its potential vulnerability in a post-brexit world . 
   a recent survey conducted for european movement ireland has though , highlighted the very large share of people in ireland that think the country should remain a part of the european union . 
  split by region , these figures range from 80 percent in leinster ( excluding dublin ) and an unequivocal 94 percent in munster .

   as highlighted by the latest edition of the european drug report , estonia is the country with the most drug-induced deaths per million population in europe . 
  at 103 , 82 above the eu average , only sweden comes close with 100 deaths . 
  at the other end of the scale , portugal , where drugs were decriminalised back in 2001 , had only 6 per million people . 
  looking outside of europe , estonia 's problems are pulled into sharp relief by the rate in the united states . 
  in 2016 , there were a staggering 185 deaths per million .

  i doubt it 's fake . 
  there are more pictures of fire in different angles . 
  someone shared this an hour ago on r/croatia . 
  situation is really tough . 
  according to article linked above , fire is getting close to split and detonations are heard . 
  firefighting planes are returned to base because of bura .
