ah the good old andreas, 
  you can replace it with any nation in the balkan and you will get the same result . 
  woo finally croatia is in the top 5 of something !, 
  invade iceland and literally kill yourself . 
  http://puu.sh/brzzd/c11c17ab9c.png great job britbongs, 
  american puppet state does what america wants . 
  english , german , czech and croatian this gives me a 99.99 % understanding of serbian , bosnian , slovak . 
  some understanding of slovene and polish and macedonian/bulgarian . 
  my mind is now blown sellotape was a brand ? 
  i at least call all thin clear adhesive tape that . 
  i guess you do n't live in slavonia where `` domace je domace '' ( homemade is homemade it has two meaning usually homegrown food is better but also that our slavonian or croatian food is just better and safer ) is a thing and people really do prefer to buy our food . 
  mostly because they have somone in the food industry . 
  nutella right because the company totally is n't called ferrero and is n't owned by nestle . 
  ulker is a part of y\u0131ld\u0131z holding . 
  probably a lot more mistakes this is just something i noticed right away . 
  well this is actually a problem for us or so analyst have said . 
  croatia here . 
  seems out mobility is very low so we ca n't find jobs and are very stationary . 
  becuase it 's usually better economically to live in your own house and earn less then to go work in another city and pay rent . 
  someone fucked up bad . 
  serbija : cevapi bosnia : bosnaian pot what the hell ... 
  nor will korea or japan and they seem to be doing well without it it seems . 
  we 're talking about literally austria here not the fear reaching borderlands of the empire that was on the hungarian less developed side . 
  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/dissolution_of_austria-hungary.png if you compare this picture with todays gdp per region http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/90/map_of_gdp_per_capita_in_the_eu_in_2007_%28nuts_3%29.png south western poland is one of the best parts of the country , czechs were the best out of the commies and obviously we have slovenia here . 
  hungarian parts did n't do so well and this includes us . 
  croatia is 99.99 % white naturally there is not going to be any non old white man in croatia and that wo n't be any different for centuries to come . 
  also old white females are actually the biggest anti-gay forces in croatia . 
  so please . 
  this old dude is pro gay http://metro-portal.hr/img/repository/2010/06/medium/josipovic_novinari_cx_gm.jpg while this middle aged white chick is anti gay http://lgbt.ba/site/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/zeljka.jpg, 
  global ? 
  so people in south america , africa and asia that do n't border russia somehow think less of it now ? 
  me too !, 
  but hey i like it the eu way not ruled by one big happy putin family that tells you what to think , what to do and who to trust . 
  would i love it . 
  yes a lot !, 
  but yugoslavia proved that such as system is really hard to maintain without a common culture and language . 
  because nationalism is always a stronger grouping in the bad economic times . 
  please do !, 
  i 'm slavonian for quite a few generations back . 
  our top three guesses for your english dialect ( think ) * 1 . 
  singaporean * 2 . 
  australian * 3 . 
  new zealandish our top three guesses for your native ( first ) language ( think ) * 1 . 
  romanian * 2 . 
  italian * 3 . 
  greek mfw not even close , also i speak 3 other languages croatian , czech and german . 
  jesus christ the symbolism . 
  first the picture is divided into west and east . 
  you have putin to the east two steps down from a red carpet symbolizing communism looking into the future . 
  to the west you have a frail queen going down from a red carpet that could symbolize a once mighty empire that also used red as one of it 's main colors . 
  then you have america and new zeland helping her down , both of these men are non-white and now rule once british colonies . 
  you have merkel and hollande plotting something while the the queen of denmark sort of tries to stick close to the west but she does n't really care . 
  what will my kids say if i do n't !, 
  well one fear mongering video thats no different that one video where muslims are killing white people in of allah wo n't convince me that this ttip is bad nor that every muslim alive is a terrorist . 
  so yeah tell me about the things i 'm really interested in . 
  will i get cheaper electronics and video games ? 
  will prices change ? 
  will some factories be force to close because of the competing cheaper prices and so forth . 
  whats going to be done about import from america whats going to be done about exports from europe to america will some factories make more money ? 
  i 'm not interested in dead chickens and red liquid being pumped into corn not only is that not how gmo works but it 's also retarded and it 's also fear mongering for the masses . 
  so please we 're not retarded . 
  let 's talk law and it 's effect not dead chickens and shit . 
  count me in . 
  i sure as hell ca n't . 
  i wonder will my house will raise in value as the sea levels do ? 
  valid question dismissed as idiotic because hurp durp it does n't meet your hurr durr `` standards '', 
  trust me . 
  roma or how they should really be called gypsies are bad . 
  you do n't know them if you have no real contact with them . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pddsydbvpu0 classic example . 
  she says : `` everyones registered at the unemployment office ( job exchange office ) , no one can find work . 
  as you can see . '', 
  reporter asks : `` what is your son by profession ? 
  ( job qualification/education/field of work ) '' roma mother says : `` by profession hes a roma just like me '', 
  you forget that rockets in the first place were 100 % a military technology until sputnik 1 changed things . 
  you could use them to send stuff to leo and actually radio it . 
  natraully first they used it for spy cameras and such . 
  but that evolved into everything you have today . 
  gps is still primarily a military technology . 
  us can cut it off to whoever it wants whenever . 
  development of glosnas and galileo and whatever china has in plans is basically a must these days . 
  i really respect putin even if we do n't agree geo politically on space . 
  he probably just wants it to show off . 
  i want it for the betterment of human kind . 
  whatever his goal is . 
  more money for space in my book is always a good thing, 
  it 's international . 
  i 'm croatian and i know france is white flag . 
  luxemburg , belgium and france . 
  countries that have either no military experience , no manpower or always white flag . 
  also a joke to the fact that europe always sits on it 's but and goes `` sanctions '' and then nothing ever happens or gets resolved . 
  no croatians politicans match my views . 
  gee who would have expected that . 
  well i watched it on rtl2 like 10 years ago . 
  so there should be some on youtube maybe ? 
  there was some usually fox , viva and rtl 2 . 
  no idea how it looks today i kind of stopped watching tv . 
  also googling for german anime . 
  well deutsch anime . 
  yeah i tried to learn hangul when i was playing the ro2 beta back in what 2006 or something .
