  can they said till 2050 when kosovo join the eu thats the question, 
  it was some year 200x i ca n't remember . 
  i was in belgium ( geel ) on a youth conference about water conservation and water in general . 
  so anyways we went to the eu parliament , we talked a bit there about it well not me the representatives i was like 13 or something . 
  so anyways i speak 4 languages ( english , german , czech and croatian ) . 
  so we had these panels each country presented their home products and such . 
  our teacher had the great idea to get us some local croatian folk clothes . 
  some of the other countries had the same idea . 
  i think a few of the baltic ones and hungary . 
  anyways so we 're dressed like this http://www.kud-preporod.com/slike/slavonija.jpg and i 'm talking to lots of people in different languages and having fun and then a very obvious english lady comes by and asks . 
  `` why do you people dress like this ? '', 
  `` do you dress like this every day ? '', 
  `` do n't you have normal clothes ? '', 
  so start explaining it 's just a folk dress and such . 
  and shes totally surprised that we have a normal country with a normal life . 
  yeah but thats like what 15-20 ( 2 ~ 3 $ ) kunas ... one big ketchup for 2 $ lasts months !, 
  i also like to eat cheese with ketchup and spring onions . 
  and by cheese i mean like emmentaler types and such . 
  http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-brij26fklya/ttuxppavf-i/aaaaaaaae1y/ld1ycvitz6w/s1600/dsc_3195.jpg yes i even put cheese on like this guy here . 
  i dont feel like it takes that much oil . 
  i do n't know ... 
  i usually store the oil and reuse it until it gets all discolored . 
  yes yes i know cancer and shit ... 
  much food was eaten yes yes, 
  sounds reasonable . 
  also easy . 
  anyone else eat fried cauliflower with yougurt . 
  i noticed czechs do it and we do it here too in croatia . 
  oh boy i ca n't imagine how uncomfortable that must be . 
  i 'm always get like this sort of cringey feeling when my grandfather starts wiping out all these eu is shit and a monster theories . 
  ahahaha how do you evne start this topic with your hairdresser, 
  they 're 80 years old and they only heard good things about it from their grandparents and parents . 
  sure, 
  obviously . 
  the new statues say so . 
  this really , it comes in disbelief . 
  i remember my old folks saying this will blow over in a few months , no one is this dumb , why would we wage war we 're all in this boat together . 
  and in my family at least they were thinking will blow over soon . 
  today they 're conflicted on who to blame . 
  they hate the obvious croatian propaganda , they hate the obvious srb propaganda , they do n't trust the west because reasons i do n't even know ... 
  it 's like they wan na blame someone and the outside is the easiest to blame because no one gets upset if you blame the third guy i guess ? 
  my grandfather is 100 % convinced it was the english they 're theiving scum who do n't work , only know how to steal , they 're the worst people on earth . 
  btw he loves germans , russians and anyone central european . 
  he hates england for reasons unknown and he for some reason equals england with the us and always says why did they need to leave their island , we had our lands here and we stays austro-hungary did n't go and colonize , enslave , rob half of the world . 
  they did . 
  i wish he could play eu4 maybe he 'd get some stuff ... 
  well i lived in a few places , up the hill here https://www.google.hr/maps/@49.058489,17.483396,3a,75y,121.9h,92.71t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1su8sxwdckna8ng7fb10vlnq!2e0?hl=en then in the commie blocks near the zimn\u00ed stadion and kaufland we changed a few apartments there . 
  this place https://www.google.hr/maps/place/zimn%c3%ad+stadion+uhersk%c3%a9+hradi%c5%a1t%c4%9b/@49.068638,17.474855,3a,75y,127.56h,96.79t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1ssr0bu3uiqkxnccsl6ww4da!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x04a735840bd9a540?hl=en man i remember were were up to our heads in water when the floods came so we had stuff deliverd by boat because it 's like a natural pool of sorts . 
  i wonder if that zahratske potreby place still works . 
  i have n't been back in like 5 years ... 
  anyone not currently in nato technically would be not first world . 
  so sweden , finland , austria , switzerland , serbia and so on ... 
  top kek, 
  funny thing yugoslavia , sweden , finland , austria and switzerland are all third world countries . 
  also ireland . 
  where do you see czech similarities with belarus and russia ? 
  honestly what do you consider western ? 
  like i 've been to villages in germany and austria . 
  they look very much alike the ones in the czech republic . 
  and i do n't mean the tourist trap bullshit . 
  i mean real remote villages where 90 year old people live and lament on how everything is different and austro-hungary / germany was the best . 
  as a person who as lived in the czech republic in uherske hradiste and here in croatia in osijek also a bit in germany passau i can tell you there terms really do n't mean a lot . 
  you are and will always be central european . 
  you like us have a distinct communist flavor that will vanish only when people born in the 2000s or maybe 2010s become leaders so in 30-40 years . 
  germany does n't have that . 
  they take everything a bit more seriously . 
  there is way less corruption and everything is well more serious from the attitude of getting a job to how well everything is organized . 
  german capitalism it seems works incredibly well . 
  i 'm gon na state the very obvious here but germany  czech  croatia now that being said you ca n't ever say you 're eastern europe or second world . 
  i lived in a city called hungarian castle/fortress and the architecture in most of the city center was this http://vseovinu.vachta.cz/webfiles/obrazky/uherske_hradiste.jpg but the surrounding parts where obviously this http://www.czechsoccernet.cz/obrazky/uhsize800x450/panoramauh.jpg good old commie blocks everywhere . 
  so basically you are a mix of good old central european culture of the old holy roman empire and these last 50 years of communism . 
  there will obviously be commie blocks . 
  but hey i 've seen commie blocks of literally the same type in sweeden and finland too so whatever . 
  you 're moving in a more forward western direction with everything but communism still lingers just like here . 
  in germany ( western germany ) naturally they have none of that . 
  they do in eastern germany but in bavaria it 's all very obviously well not touched by communism . 
  so if you ask me are you second world ? 
  i 'd say you 're as second world as eastern germany . 
  i also visited poland for example . 
  they in my opinion have had a much more severe form of communism and while i was there everything seems to be a bit more communist . 
  i guess they 're a very big country and development can only go so fast . 
  tl : dr you 're central european whatever that means . 
  ** i 'd rate you 1.5 world ** . 
  portugal and spain and italy are `` first world '' yet some part of these countries are worse then croatia i ca n't say you 're 2nd at all . 
  that amount of butthurt towards austria wow, 
  24 sata and b92 the clickbase websites . 
  if you ask me \u0160e\u0161elj and glava\u0161 should be banned from all forms of media . 
  but i guess no one can resist some good old stand up comedy . 
  serbia , bosnia ( herzegovinian croats ) , communists , communism , fascists , right-wing hdz last term , hungary if we go back 100 + years . 
  depends on whos in power . 
  all them 3 kiss serbs, 
  i like the city idea very much !, 
  yeah this really considering all the talk these days about anti euro shit i 'd think 70 % were against it not 41 % for it !, 
  honestly to me it 's like hes from north korea . 
  when a dictatorship loses all power of it 's surrounding countries they use the only thing they have and thats nukes to threaten people . 
  no no nooooooo, 
  look you need to take into account all these underdeveloped countries like afganistan or africa or syria are thousands of miles away from developed countries and they 're uneducated and poor . 
  they for a lack of a better words `` do n't know any better '' . 
  it 's like north korea were they tell everyone they live in paradise and show starving americans killing each other in cowboy movies . 
  you have a country with total population : 98.4 % literate , 53.1 % of the population uses the internet , everyone has more or less access to modern media at breack neck speeds .
