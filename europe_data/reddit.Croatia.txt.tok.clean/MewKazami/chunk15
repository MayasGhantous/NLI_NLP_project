  sounds to me more like we 're going to have some bread with something sweet, 
  i mean like milk , bread , candy and so on ... 
  what does that buy you ? 
  i find this really hilarious . 
  because people from the countries you 've been to say their food taste like shit compared to south europe . 
  so italy , spain , greece , croatia , serbia , bulgaria , romania and so on ... http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/04/06/article-2598319-1ce34e1800000578-448_634x286.jpg this basically . 
  the potato/beer/vodka people are always amazed at how sweet our fruits and vegetables are in the south . 
  also look at the sunshine hours map https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/europe_sunshine_hours_map.png i had a polish and german friend over and they were stunned how our cherries tasted so sweet . 
  so i have to say i 'm relay surprised . 
   as that language does n't exist that phrase is an oxymoron . 
  be that as it might . 
  there more difference between croatian \u0160tokavian vs kajkavian and \u010cakavian then there is between standard \u0160tokavian croatian and standard \u0160tokavian serbian . 
  msot common name in slovakia is horvat . 
  fishy if you ask me . 
  are you the hun ? 
  fuck yeah finally some sense . 
  we need nuclear it 's literally the only carbon free way that can cover for solar . 
  sounds like an average slavic grandmother haha, 
  interestingly yeah thats was the reason in most cases . 
  huge long cables run on the side of buildings . 
  i guess whats why bill gates so rich . 
  he invented windows !, 
  i do wonder if it 's like a austro-hungarian or slavic thing . 
  i lived in the czech republic and pr\u016fvan is handled the same as propuh here ... 
  for years as a kid we used to literally turn off everything electrical in our house when there was a storm . 
  because 15 years ago one of the neighbors got his bootleg antenna struck by lighting . 
  my mom always went the extras step saying . 
  you need to wait a few hours after you fucking faned you hair with a fan !, 
  because freshly faned hair is also somehow bad, 
  ahahahaa oh god yeah ... 
  fuck you 're right sorry !, 
  i tried to find it again but i could n't ... a video of some scandi teens with long wet hair going around playing in the snow for like 5 ~ 10 minutes . 
  and i always think wow they sure must have gotten meningitis . 
  yeah we got that one too ... 
  but someone told me it 's actually really good for the boys because of testicles and bad for the girls because of vagina ... at least when you 're a child . 
  i ca n't really remember why ... 
  these obviously happen because of the serbia chemtrails sprayed in the adriatic . 
  i wonder if other cultures have this too . 
  you got the flu - draft you got sick - obviously you were cold from the draft you got pink/red eye - draft you got an ear infection - drafts you body hurts today ? 
  - must be because you were in a drafty area yesterday . 
  honorable mentions . 
  do n't go out in the cold with wet hair instant meningitis !, 
  but mom meningitis is caused by bacteria . 
  shut your mouth mister . 
  do n't go outside without a jacket you 'll get sick !, 
  feeling cold means you 're going to get instantly sick !, 
  chamomile tea cures everything . 
  yes even cancer . 
  and here i am speaking perfect german sitting in my house in croatia not moving there ; _ ;, 
  this really it 's not like 20 % of them decided to go back . 
  it 's a few literally a few in a million . 
   repeated applications may result in a toxic buildup of chemicals such as arsenic , cadmium , and uranium in the soil . 
  these toxic chemicals can eventually make their way into your fruits and vegetables . 
  this is the problem . 
  heavy metal buildup that you body ca n't filter out and that increases cancer risk percentages . 
  yep they look like absolute dog shit , yet they taste way better then the all the store bought beefsteak ( thats the shape of it ) . 
  i really like grappolo tomatos or cherry ones but they 're also a lot more bitter . 
  thats again the shape as in they grow like grapes . 
  it 's not genetic modification that causes cancers . 
  why are people so retarded . 
  it 's the artificial fertilizers + pesticides that get absorbed into produce . 
  gm crops are totally fine jesus humanity has done gm for millennia via splicing and cross pollination . 
  just look at all our dogs they 're all fucking gm . 
  yep this really . 
  if you want to grow homegrown things best things to grow are sweet watery fruit and vegetables . 
  prepare for walls of text !!, 
  first to prove i know what i 'm talking about i also have agricultural grandparents . 
  and i help around here and there . 
  and we have a lot of different produce . 
  so i can compare a lot of it . 
  http://puu.sh/nalgl/184cb3bd7f.jpg - muh beans http://puu.sh/nalxj/62bee92c20.jpg - muh cauliflower http://puu.sh/nam6s/e01b6dbb71.jpg - muh tomatos http://puu.sh/nam63/841732f394.jpg - muh tomato sauce so basically heres the thing . 
  homemade stuff often has trade offs and it comes in three varieties * consistency of taste * labor / cost * quality theres also a thing of what you are growing . 
  honestly i do n't see much of a difference between homegrown salad , cauliflower , broccoli , carrots and radish ( they 're more about harvest time ) , parley , celery , basically all the vegetable non sweet stuff . 
  i also do n't see much of a difference when it comes to nuts , such as walnuts , almond and hazel . 
  what i do tend to see a difference in is the sweet watery fruit such as tomato , peaches , apples , watermelon and so on . . basically these fruit need an optimal sweetness to size ratio . 
  but mass industrial agriculture is mostly oriented on mass and volume . 
  so they let them get big but they taste like shit . 
  apples/tomatoes are a great example where you have these home grown shitty almost rotten looking apples like these here http://www.market.ba/slike/oglasi/sx_818722.3.jpg yet they 're sweet and tasty as fuck . 
  compare to the hollow tasteless perfect apples of the supermarkets http://namirnice.ba/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/jabuke-i-zubi.jpg so on the to point . 
  i 'd say if you 're growing things grow watery fruit theres the most difference . 
  also carrots/radish/parsley / celery/oregano/mint so basically aromatic and root vegetables are good to have in the garden and ready to take out . 
  since they grow year round really and they 're kept fresh by simply being in the ground . 
  ** tl ; dr for first part : grow your own fruit and aromatic/root vegetables . 
  ** now on to the meats and produce part . 
  i wo n't cover milk because honestly drink sterilized milk . 
  plus keeping cows/goats is a lot harder then pigs/chicken . 
  so keeping chicken ... 
  i honestly ca n't tell you if home grown eggs are all that better ... 
  they tends to be more yolk in homegrown eggs from what i can tell and thats about it . 
  when my grandmother brags about eggs she rarely ever says oh notice the taste difference no she says notice how yellow it is . 
  they 're so fresh and homemade ... on to meat taste . 
  fresh meat just like that i ca n't really tell the difference . 
  between my grandmothers chicken breast and the ones i buy in my supermarket . 
  but when it comes to salami and such things you can definitely tell it 's homemade . 
  same goes for say tomato sauce or similar things . 
  the problem with homemade produce such as yogurt , salami , tomato sauce , hell even cakes and pastry is well you 're never going to have consistent taste . 
  you might take the exact same measurements and do things exactly the same but usually these simply not as much control as they have in an industrial setting . 
  especially when it comes to things like temperature . 
  try as you might you 're never going to get that perfect mcdolands fries or that pizzeria pizza at home without a stone oven or a industrial frying machine ... 
  so on year my tomato sauce batch totally failed because we accidentally put in a bit too much salt .
