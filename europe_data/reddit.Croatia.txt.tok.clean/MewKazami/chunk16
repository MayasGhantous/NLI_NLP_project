  and these things happen ... ** tl ; dr second part . 
  the problem with making complicated products at home is control over quality , temperature and taste . 
  you simply do n't have the resources of a factory . 
  ** so to sum it all up home made is nice . 
  but it 's not as nice as everyone hypes it up to be . 
  then again i 'm from croatia and our supermarkets are stocked form local farmers not industrial giants . 
  so most of our produce is n't western style industrial farming . 
  we 're also at a really optimal latitude so naturally our tomatoes are sweeter then say polish/sweedish tomatoes . 
  everybody hates zemano, 
  damn thats a good one,

  how about a gypsie shoot out because of farts ? 
  at least it 's only 30 % try about 60 % in my city osijek .

  the problem with bosnia is that it 's basically highlands . 
  http://24sata.info/thumbnail.php?file=news/2013/juni/tajan12_683859253.jpg&amp;size=article_large https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/bosnia_and_herzegovina_topographic_map.svg/600px-bosnia_and_herzegovina_topographic_map.svg.png this is the geography of bosnia . 
  a lot of the country is like on 500m or up . 
  with lowlands in the north and south . 
  http://www.mappery.com/maps/bosnia-and-herzegovina-land-use-map.jpg the red areas usually traded with the serbs and the souther parts with dalmatia . 
  but really the ottoman empire had no real way to get there and had no interest in building infrastructure there . 
  http://media-2.web.britannica.com/eb-media/01/6201-004-805f3655.jpg look how incredibly mountainous the balkans are so i 'm guessing pre industrial age it was pretty much impossible to get there . 
  no trains or anything . 
  i wo n't speak for everyone because i do n't know everyone i 'll speak for the average . 
  this will be a long post so i 'll try to explain everything . 
  so there are yugoslav literacy rates pre-ww2 http://imgur.com/ig4eqam after ww2 when the kingdom was abolished and the federation of yugoslavia was made it was a train wreck of a country . 
  you had all sorts of people in all sorts of places . 
  you had illiterate generals now elites buying books by kilogram and color for their new houses to seem upper class . 
  1950 was probably the worst period . 
  huge unemployment , inflation , government seizing of private property . 
  1960 with a steadily improving education levels yugoslavia comes onto the world stage as china is now . 
  a developing prosperous country building vast infrastructure projects , exporting both to the west and east , booming industry , 1970 it was all still going strong , the economical and social structures tried to reform themselves into something more sustainable , it was probably the golden years . 
  with plenty of work for everyone and a lot of immigration due to a huge shift from a agrarian society to a industrial one . 
  so a lot of displacement of population . 
  also there was the oil crisis and shit started really hitting the fan there . 
  at first it was manageable but then dept just accumulated . 
  1980 between 1979 and 1985 the yugoslav dinar plunged from 15 to 1,370 to the u.s. dollar . 
  this says enough how hard the shit hit the dept fan . 
  inflation snowballed , unemployment snowballed . 
  old people look at the rosy days but in economical terms they were n't rosy at all . 
  yugoslavia was still by gdp per capita behind say czechoslovakia . 
  a bit better then hungary . 
  the problem was for a lot of old people after ww2 their life changed considerably . 
  you got electricity , education , infrastructure and basically by from 1950-1970 they got a real functioning country . 
  after this war in the 1990 they just saw all the progress destroyed . 
  horrid corruption , privatization , unfair or no return of old capital seized by the government and so on and on ... 
  so what regions profited the most from the fall of yugoslavia ? 
  slovenia got more or less untouched by the war , they had a huge industry that was well known so they could still sell to all sides of the war after the war . 
  dalmatia/istira aka tourism regions got a huge tourism boost and a government that focused on that . 
  they got huge infrastructure projects done . 
  they probably by far are better off . 
  what regions suffered the most ? 
  industrial regions and regions tied to industry . 
  industry was now forced to sell to a much lower consumer base , had access to way less resources and industry was a very valid target in the war . 
  plus there was the whole `` privatization '' thing . 
  farmers could n't sell their goods now , industry could buy goods or sell . 
  so in general i think the biggest losers are southern serbia and bosnia . 
  there regions needed investment capital to develop and it could have come form the more richer states . 
  instead because of the war no one form the west really wanted the regions and because of the russian / american polarization investment became even more complicated . 
  tl ; dr slovenians and costal people are better off everyone else not much ... 
  naturally people politically affiliated stole tons of got opportunities that would n't have presented themselves otherwise . 
  so these individuals got lucky or had the right or morally wrong set of skills to profit . 
  obviously it 's serbia . 
  we listen to their music , we know all their customs , our celebrities intermarry often , movie/tv stars often appear in each others shows , tons of stuff really . 
  it 's just that there was a war and some people are still pissy about it . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsltyuxxre4 how do you train a policeman in 40:1 situation ? 
  we needs a thousands of troops at the borders to do what you 're suggesting . 
  yes yes it is . 
  what would happen if i went to a border checkpoint between serbia and bulgaria and then just ran through it . 
  police men would come after me , they tackle me and cuff me later i 'd be charged a crime . 
  why are immigrants from afghanistan treated differently i do n't know . 
  actual solution would be to send troops to greece and secure it border . 
  taser and gas immigrants try to cross and then send them back . 
  i 'm pretttty sure we 're more talking about a north/south korea killing zone here . 
  holy why why are krofne everywhere like 1.5 kunas . 
  i 'm drowning in them help me i am addicted !, 
  holy fuck if this passes !, 
  rooting for you !, 
  it 's funny because it was on both sides . 
  this article seems to completely ignore the fact that opinions in visgrade and eeu are also extremely divided and tend to swerve towards immigration and refugee-acceptsism . 
  instead the author writes as if the whole of eeu is wholehearty anti-immigration from the middle east . 
  it should also be noted that many politicians in the western european countries have also failed to realize this . 
  thats because of the media . 
  slavs are seen more or less as equals it seems or at least they 're the bad commines or something , it 's okay to hate em ( yes romanians are slavs just like hungarians ) . 
  while gypsies , muslims and blacks from africa are n't by social standards or something ... 
  so for the sake of integrating them , minor offenses are ignored . 
  and the problem begins when more and more minor offenses are ignored .
