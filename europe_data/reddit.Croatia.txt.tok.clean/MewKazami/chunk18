  this . 
  free fuel forever or at least until they notice how much people are using superchargers for . 
  acceleration on par with million dollar cars . 
  insane fuel economy . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jjntuh5e-0 most of western and north europe is covered if you want to go any bigger distance . 
  i lost like a few fights to bosnia they were alliend to the uk and regularly visited south america for wars . 
  it was so crazy . 
  yeah i did that once . 
  then 38k spanish troops came . 
  and almost lost . 
  i played eu4 the whole fucking day just to notice i failed hard . 
  http://puu.sh/m7fex/4298b9cb67.png http://puu.sh/m7fx3/d76fbfb58f.jpg i needed to conquer both north and south america and i 'm very far from it ... next time i need to rethink my ideas . 
  can anyone tell me why one world government would be bad ? 
  is n't that what we should be aiming for ? 
  not separation and petty squabbling over nation states of the old ? 
  imagine you 're me and you watched german rtl from 1992 onwards . 
  home alone for 23 fucking years . 
  home alone . 
  sounds good to me . 
  one could say he puts a spin on things, 
  you did n't buy out . 
  grats !, 
  not really . 
  t-com or t-mobile or whatever you wan na call them is notorious for being corrupt with post communist governments from poland down to croatia . 
  they basically swept in during post communism and bought a lot of infrastructure for piss cheap . 
  then charged insane prices . 
  i 'll always remember i had flat rate internet from the start from 64 kbit to now 50 mbit on xnet now b.net . 
  meanwhile you had to pay for flat rate internet until like 2012 with t-com . 
  if anything they 're the comcast or verizon of the eastern europe . 
  and only until recently held huge near monopolies everywhere . 
  most of our government telecoms where/are t-owned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/t-hrvatski_telekom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deutsche_telekom https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/magyar_telekom honestly they 're shady as fuck . 
  all this butthurt over internet comments, 
  i 'll try to put this as softly as possible . 
  as a german/english/czech / croatian speaker danish sounds like someone took me and smashed me against a wall really hard until i got brain damage . 
  then i tried to speak but all these languages were mixed together https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-moy8vuebk, 
  norway . 
  cold . 
  rich . 
  sophisticated . 
  very little non-european immigrants . 
  its perfection !, 
  there is nothing better in life then being warm while the outside is cold . 
  it 's like i 'm reading about every diaspora ever from the balkans, 
  literally everyone in the middle east is depose a ruthless dictator . 
  isis too .

  sure everyone wants a corrupt free country right now . 
  but we 're slowly making progress towards just that . 
  well i myself found it really boring in my own community . 
  they never discuss the things i like or have the same hobbies . 
  thats why i gravitated to the internet . 
  now while in america and other big countries the communities themselves in the native language are big and you can find people to interact with . 
  in small countries i do n't think this is possible . 
  i speak 4 languages but mostly english nowdays because thats what we all agree to talk in so everyone can understand . 
  i think smaller countries inhabitants naturally tend to be more inclined to see whats it like in other places . 
  i 'm pretty sure you could correlate the statistics above with students studying abroad per million and get sort of the same numbers . 
  we 're still spending too much . 
  but you 're right it bounced back . 
  as in it got to 900 mil euros again ... back from 400 mil euros . 
  you know your country is great when it spends more on rnd then on roads . 
  if only croatian government could take note of that ... http://puu.sh/lnh85/4eaf3097d5.png look at this shit . 
  to be honest it is n't misleading . 
  if it 's a pension it 's out of the welfare fund . 
  that much is a given . 
  if it was named prime ministers pay after work . 
  then it 's misleading because you 'd think it 's not a pention and it 's coming from other sources such as the budget for his office . 
  every prime minister and cabinet members get that even here in croatia . 
  honestly income tax and insurance tax are just the same thing . 
  it 's just that income tax is free to be spend wherever while insurance tax must be spend on public health and safety . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/massacres_of_albanians_in_the_balkan_wars see this is called a massacre , warcrime , crime against humanity ? 
  a lot more people died back then . 
  wikipedia list it as a massacre and your own side does too . 
  genocide is a buzzword but it has strong connotations and should be reserved for events that have higer numbers , numbers that dwarf your countries population . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_bangladesh_genocide if this happened in kosovo there would be no kosovo . 
  or this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/armenian_genocide or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_genocide, 
  literally what genocide ? 
  i must live in bizaroworld where barricades , enclaves and 70k nato troops constitute a safe country . 
  i mean i know you albanians love your county but for fuck sake can you even see what you 're writing ?!, 
  it 's like saying north korea safest country in the world !, 
  nothing can happen to you there if you do n't disobey the government , do n't cross the border , do n't say a single bad world about the dear leader and so on ... 
  thats how it was in continental croatia now everyone has an ac, 
  its a pre global warming thing id say kind of like when chinese people come to wein and wonder why such a small country has such a glorious capital, 
  yeah i know how you feel i 'm from continental croatia . 
  since the 2000s started it 's all out of whack . 
  i remember being outside as a kid at noon in summer it was like 30 \u00b0 c the whole summer holiday . 
  i remember building snowforts and we had huge class battles before the christmas holidays in primary school ( 6/7-14 / 15 years old ) but basically i feel like the whole `` seasons '' thing shifted by a month into the future . 
  like real winter starts on january , instead of leaves going yellow mid-september they go yellow like mid-november . 
  i 'm mean it 's saint nicholaus today . 
  i do n't remember there being so much green on the trees http://puu.sh/llj4f/9f89b73138.jpg, 
  i for one welcome rain http://www.msdwt.k12.in.us/no/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sahara-desert-map.gif, 
  question is is that your christmas or ours . 
  thank you did n't know that, 
  honestly every army in the world except the us one is underfunded even the russian one . 
  why ? 
  because no one battles anyone except 3rd world sand countries and yugoslavia/argentina `` wars '' . 
  let 's think about it . 
  in the last 40 years so thats f-14 , f-15 , f-16 , f-18 , mig-29 , su-27 , su-24 , panavia tornado , mirage 2000 , sukhoi su-25 , a-10 warthhog so what countries did these planes fight in ? 
  iraq , iran , syria , israel , jordan , egypt , afganistan , sudan , libya , nigeria and other african nations i ca n't list . 
  literally all of these conflicts are muslim . 
  there literally 3 conflicts where muslims are n't present in the least 40 years .
