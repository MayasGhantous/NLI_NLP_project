  now correct me if i 'm wrong . 
  the falklands war and the serbo-croatian war and ukraine today . 
  but only the serbo-croatian war . 
  serbia - kosvo ( kosovo is muslim ) serbia - bosnia ( parts of bosnia are muslim ) russia - chechnya also muslim so why invest horrendous amounts of money into military when economies are the real hurt . 
  look at russia today they set back their economy by 25 % since 5 years ago because of ukraine . 
  why should european nations have huge armies ? 
  if russia attacks europe it 's mad with nukes no point . 
  european obviously wo n't be fighting between themselves they 're economically way too dependent . 
  so the only countries that are actually fighting are jews vs muslim in isreal and muslims vs muslims in africa/asia . 
  everything else is regional civil wars . 
  well it was in the media 2 years ago . 
  but the problem has been there for over 10 years . 
  defence cuts announced in march 2003 resulted in the decision to retire 90 tornados from luftwaffe service . 
  this led to a reduction in its tornado strength to four wings by september 2005 . 
  [ 136 ] [ 137 ] on 13 january 2004 , the then german defence minister peter struck announced further major changes to the german armed forces . 
  a major part of this announcement is the plan to cut the german fighter fleet from 426 in early 2004 to 265 by 2015 . 
  [ 138 ] the german tornado force is to be reduced to 85 , with the type expected to remain in service with the luftwaffe until 2020 . 
  [ 50 ] the aircraft being retained have been undergoing a service life extension programme . 
  [ 139 ] currently , the luftwaffe operates tornados with tactical wings taktisches luftwaffengeschwader 33 in cochem / b\u00fcchel , rhineland-palatinate and with taktisches luftwaffengeschwader 51 `` immelmann '' in jagel , schleswig-holstein . 
  aircrew training takes place at fliegerisches ausbildungszentrum der luftwaffe , based on holloman air force base in new mexico , us . 
  this was known for what 2 years now ... 
  nothing new for the people that follow it . 
  no croatia ... 
  leave it to the diaspora to be more `` insert nationality here '' . 
  it 's so hilarious how half of every serb , croat , bosnian , albanian i meet outside of their own country is 50 times more serb , croat , bosnian , albanian then anyone in these countries . 
  but i 've yet to hear of radical magyars , guess there a first time for everything . 
  probably because all the magyars i know all well integrated here in croatia . 
  my neighbor ( croat ) even married one . 
  sure there is especially economy and law and social science/languages not enough stem, 
  main problem with estonia is your language by far . 
  too obscure . 
  honestly begin whatever the fuck you wan na be in croatia does n't look good . 
  you can have 2 doctorates and they wo n't take you because you lack experience . 
  i 'm just saying both of them are democratically elected, 
  can we support the greeks too because turkey violated their airspace at least 1 a day this year . 
  putin was n't ? 
  last time i checked he was . 
  i 'm sure it wo n't because turkey violated greek airspace 2000 times this year alone . 
  well i was interested in the eu back when the czech republic was joining because i lived there . 
  so it came naturally to me to always know the number . 
  nah they 're to smart to say it 's that . 
  because they know the statistics . 
  let me prove my point like this . 
  i simply opened google and type in european refuge http://puu.sh/lbe5m/90f1a664ab.jpg what i see here is maps , a lot of people on boats , a lot of people on train and these are all neutral unemotional pictures for me . 
  crowded boats and trains are n't so special . 
  but then child crawling under fence , child being lifted over fence , child with father on train tracks , dead child on the beach , poor child and it 's family walk . 
  these are the emotional think of the children photos in the media . 
  this is n't about what you can be . 
  it 's about social behavior and norms . 
  even in japan where this is happening http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/06/22/national/social-issues/nearly-40-of-single-japanese-not-interested-in-romance-survey/#.vlmbj-kmz-w it 's not socially acceptable not to have a girlfriend or wife . 
  even if 40 % of the young population thinks `` meh i do n't ' give a fuck '' but society is n't made out of a minority it 's made up of everyone and traditions , cultural factors , religion etc. . . maybe 5 % of the total population has a gay tendency . 
  i do n't know where you live but i bet you that in each and every european country if you have n't had a girlfriend by 20 you 're pretty much a loser or odd guy in everyone eyes but the people who are single like you . 
  it 's funny how the media keep insisting these are females and children fleeing war when it 's really 75 % or something rounding it down young 18 ~ 30 men . 
  i 'm not blaming them but you know i guess i ca n't know ... 
  i 'd expect people to say 25-30 or something ... 
  but the question is straight forward so it can me misleading . 
  i was 27 just a few years ago ... so if you heard it 5 years ago and remembered it like that 28 would be like no ... 
  well to be honest for slovenia eu is still a fresh thing , you guys are in it since it was like 6 members not 28, 
   all numbers above ten are trivia . 
  really now ? 
  how many people aka how much population are/is there in lithuania , latvia , slovenia , slovakia , estonia , czech republic , croatia , serbia , bosnia , moldavia , malta , andora , luxemburg , norway , ireland , austria ... 
  they 're all sub 10 ... 
  i mean i can tell you accurately to about 1 ~ 2 million for baltic ones and like spot on for all the slavic ones . 
  is it ? 
  i mean if you 're a part of it it 's kind of ... obvious to me at least . 
  then i again i know a shitton of german states because of eu4 ... remembering as far back as like before the ascention of czech republic , slovakia and the others back in 2004 i knew the number ... 
  you know what i do n't get ... 
  i can fly from tuzla ( bosnia and herzegovina ) to stockholm ( skavska airport ) for fucking 15 $ https://wizzair.com/en-gb/timetable you can fly from prauge to rome for 30 $ you can fly form prauge to venice for fucking 600 k\u010d !, 
  why is n't there more of this ? 
  are they also honoring the ancient greek tradition of not paying depts ? 
  but seriously it 's pretty spooky . 
  honestly i fucking suck at our language . 
  no spell checking lol ... also fuck \u0107\u010d\u0111\u0161\u017e, 
  ovdje http://www.computeruniverse.net/ dobijam fore sa kineskih stranica iz eu warehousa .

  turkey is only nato when it comes to russia or china . 
  i do wonder why we do n't breed . 
  i get it my i 'm a geek fuck that wo n't leave his pc but there so many normal people out there . 
  why do n't they breed ? 
  they do not . 
  that much is very obvious .

  on the inside it 's a big contrast because of property issues .

  not some of these pictures are outdated from 4 years back . 
  most of the work is done . 
  was he triggered by something ? 
  i linked to both polls and sources of the said polls here in this thread a bit down . 
  but here you probably read this on replies .

  well facts are hard to come by if you do n't accept polls . 
  i 'm pretty sure having christmas a few days later let 's you assimilate a whole lot more then not having any religious holidays in common at all . 
  let 's not even talk about covering up females , not drinking alcohol and the other totally not barbaric but `` cultural '' things islam has ... 
  yes but why would you do that and get no money or risk getting deported because they have your passport and know you 're in the eu illegally ? 
  when you can pretend to be a refugee and get free welfare and maybe german citizenship down the line ? 
  are you joking ? 
  albanians , serbians , kosovars , albanians , persians ( iranians ) and many others are just let through .
