  makaze and \u0160kare really make no sense . 
  thats because they 're borrowed words from other languages . 
  menwhile no\u017eice make perfect sense it 's it 's sort of a `` mini knife '' or `` many knives '', 
  to je ono kada se pravi \u010cobanac . 
  but this is a perfect example . 
  he wrote something in english and you had no idea and it was simply a c instead of \u010c, 
  i speak both czech and croatian and i would say that figure is n't even 50 % try watching slovenian tv and you 'll see that you do n't understand nearly as much as you think you do . 
  simply because the vocabulary is different . 
  some words have no meanings or similarities to our own . 
  others have totally different meanings and make no sense and are rather really confusing . 
  so here is literally something from a can of monster energy on my table . 
  and its actually quite confusing . 
  you 're going to be in a moment fast somewhere alone ? 
  what ... it actually means it 's going to make you fast in a moment or ubraz \u0107e vas u trenutku . 
  now when you see the translation it 's `` ahh makes sense '' no , no it does n't and it wo n't if a slovene tells you this in real life you 're gon na look at him weirdly ... the fuck did he just say going somewhere fast alone ? 
  i think people are way off on these figures and we do n't nearly understand as much has we 'd like to think . 
  for example here my case . 
  i speak both czech and croatian . 
  let 's take this one . 
  polish . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upbgfwzvquk witam was - that i understand as `` i welcome you '' jestesmy w otoczeniu , kurwa , zamkowym - we are in `` something '' , bitch , castle . 
  something could mean many things but it sounds like okolini in croatian that means like surrounding now i would n't understand it written here but i got it once he said it ... widizimy tutaj dwoje ksiazat - we see here two `` something '' if i had to guess i 'd say two crosses but it turns out it 's princes . 
  i 'm walking up to one from `` soemthing '' and i ask good day , how is the mister/gentelman feeling ? 
  - this i would n't understand if he said it out loud . 
  but since i can read i can see good day , i 'm feeling great `` wspaniale '' - now i know it 's great but i have no idea how i do ... some sort of mix of czech vyborny and skv\u011ble . 
  then later in the video it says mowie cos , mowie cos - i 'd never guess from writing that hes actually saying basically czech `` mluvim neco '' and that means i 'm saying something . 
  polish generally is for me really hard . 
  i can understand the intention of what they 're saying but i have no idea what they 're actually saying . 
  i would say i understand barely 50 % of polish . 
  let 's czech our ruski . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zei0a7gkpu8 now here i have no subtitles so i ca n't actually confirm what is being said maybe some russian anon can check if i 'm right . 
  hes like i greet you , we 're going to be doing origami with our hands today . 
  `` something '' i 'm guessing table ? 
  najabumaga - no fucking idea what this is noznjice - scissors but again if someone said this to me without showing a snaping motion i 'd never guess it 's scissors because to me this literally sounds like `` small legs '' since thats `` no\u017eice '' in croatian and yet it 's n\u016f\u017eky in czech so i 'd eventually make the connection but if i only knew croatian it would take some time to guess it 's noz - knife and then adding something make is scissors . 
  then he says something that i ca n't make out yet it sounds like `` nu princ pir bajehole '' * note i 'm using slavic latin here not english or it would be `` bayehole '' again no idea what he said . 
  ah blyet i can guess because dota . 
  vstrojem djecki praznik i 'm gon na guess it 's we 're making childrens holiday/party . 
  zajebisi origami palpshice thats how it sounds . 
  no idea it 's maybe `` fucking origami into paper '' thats how it sounds . 
  vostrojem \u0160kolski praznik - we 're doing or more specifically we 're assembling childrens holiday/party nu \u010co kak ? 
  - so how is it ? 
  blaza mi krasna to blyet zapalit - my face is nice but damn it burns . 
  here see . 
  nie suka shit pita - no bitch shit gay man so yeah i woud n't say i get even 50 % of russian . 
  i can sort of get very basic stuff but here the vocabulary is simply too different . 
  with polish i at least have czech to fall back to to compare . 
  russian just has too many different words that i never heard and i ca n't make sense of . 
  i am positive that our country would simply cease to exist 20 days after publishment of this type of data . 
  i mean that cola is probably the same as our cheap shit . 
  ours costs 0.5 $ but fuck how do they make it so disgusting . 
  i can never drink the lowest brand of sodas . 
  they 're just not drinkable . 
  yeah but there no tensions really . 
  russia is currently in the conflict to test out new weapons and secure the/a mediterranean harbor . 
  it 's also a weapons selling campaign something it really needs . 
  us is there to spread it 's sphere of influence and because all of it 's big allies do n't want assad so saudis and turkey . 
  technically the us could n't give 2 shits about syria . 
  and in reality they do n't if they did they 'd be boots on the ground afghanistan or iraq style . 
  nothing , just like theres nothing wrong with the newspapers , the problem is people that use these mediums are old and well old . 
  if you asked my grandmother if syria could lead to ww3 she would say sure . 
  then again she 'd say that for every single conflict on earth . 
  and here i was thinking there would be no more wars in the balkans and these guys basically planned to go in and execute people . 
  the balkans ...

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw1qltdrr5u by our powers combined we are hapsburg !, 
  no but i do consider german , czech and english to be separate yes . 
  i would n't say smart . 
  i 'd say i speak 4 languages . 
  and since i learned most of them at a young age it was easy . 
  after 15 i tried learning french it was hell . 
  and now i 'm struggling with japanese for years . 
  aww jee wizz what am i going to do now ... 
  i speak 3 languages learning a 4th . 
  and i do n't mean i can sort of speak em i speak em fluently . 
  meanwhile these red guys are struggling with basic english . 
  because they never get to hear it . 
   croatia i 'm surprised as you i never even heard of it . 
  but we do make that sarma a whole lot more . 
  same here i never heard of it ... 
  pbs i 'm sold . 
  watching now . 
  diocletian not tesla hmm ... 
  so nothing changed ? 
  you 're sleeping in an airplane . 
  is a few hours more not worth 100 or 200 $ saved ? 
  plus dohas airports is stunning . 
  trip is 365 $ ( return trip ) via qatar or was in october . 
  airbnb house for 6 people was like 120 $ for 1 week . 
  kyoto house was like 80 $ for 3 days and then tokyo house was 80 $ for 3 days . 
  7 days railpass was 250 $ . 
  so thats about 900 $ . 
  and then you spend how much you want there on food . 
  and since japan is piss cheap and if you eat mostly kombini food or stuff like yoshinoya , matsuya , sukiya , coco curry and local ramen/soba/tempura restaurans a meal rarely costs about 600 yen or 5.3 $ you really have to order like big portions with tons of vegetables ... edit : i just went to qatar i could fly next week for 465 $ not that much more ... you just have to watch the prices on airline tickets ... 
  see the fact that it 's not huge yet it 's literally a senior developers or doctors salary here is why you got top spots . 
  shit i went to japan for 2 weeks and the whole trip cost me only 1000 $ germans could afford to go every year . 
  me every like 5 or so ... 
  probably because say people who do n't speak german go to work in some shabby german construction company as gastarbeiters and literally earn as much as croatian doctors or college educated people in general ... 
  so being 18 straight out of high school if you went to a non gymnasium one i 'm going to say that you 're gon na easily earn 1500 $ ~ 2000 $ a month doing say carpenters work or something similar . 
  let 's not forget the youth unemplyment in croatia is like 60 % and german statistics are more like 10 or 5 or something, 
  wow big company ca n't buy politics with cash oh no !,
