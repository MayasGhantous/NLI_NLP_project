  who called you ? 
  as if we 'd allow you in hah, 
  well that too but also stuff like saint nicolaus being accompanied by a devil like krampus / \u010cert . 
  food we eat stuff liek gulash , some form of meat in breadcrums like a schnitzel , we all call creeps palachinke/y/i and so on ... 
  while some hungarians do n't like hungary i think everyone can find czechs , slovaks , polaks and austrians highly agreeable . 
  i lived in the czech republic and visited polank and slovakia often . 
  i can tell you culturally we have tons in common ... 
  we 're doing it boys austro-hungary returns !, 
  if i 'm a student or unemployed i get free dental care in croatia . 
  do dentists really cost money in france ? 
  this is very far from poor . 
  http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/6f/28/6f28b9e68cf5c32a444abd6d8f117adc.jpg this is how real poverty looks like . 
  this is croatia were out pensioners ca n't feed themselves so they go through trash . 
  where they are 70-90 years olds and have to chop wood daily so they can heat their homes in winter . 
  where even with all of that they manage to save 10 $ to give to their grandchildren . 
  my grandmother earns a whole 20 $ a month from pensions . 
  shes 80 years old she keeps chickens and has a pretty big vegetable patch . 
  she worked her entire life on a farm and theres no end to it even in her 80 she still works , still tilts the vegetable patch and harvests the potatoes and so on ... 2 weeks ago i helped chop 10 cubic meters of wood they 're going to use to basically heat up 1 single kitchen the entire winter where they live , eat and sleep . 
  grandfather sleeps in another room with huge multi layer feather filled god knows how old quilt . 
  i wear the same clothes from 10 years ago . 
  my newest clothes are all from second hand shops . 
  wearing old clothes and heating or cooling a bit less is not hardship or poverty dude . 
  so what did you struggle with ? 
  what was hard ? 
  tell me . 
  wow thats quite the butthurt . 
  if you watch the video it 's sort of wow is that really such a big deal ? 
  actually this is a big lie . 
  because it 's very certain . 
  nobody is going to get a majority . 
  theres gon na be a big coalition and the economy is going to continue to recover veeeery slowly naturally everyone is going to say it 's their party that did it totally ignoring the record tourism this years caused by all our major tourist competitors getting bombed by isis . 
  nobody is going to get a majority . 
  we 're gon na have a shaky as fuck coalition that implodes in a year and we 're gon na get new votes again . 
  these god damn english immigrants !, 
  i ca n't find any tea in my stores anymore !, 
  not a single one about bad teeth . 
  pretty nice .

  how do you divide this into 3 states or even 2 ? 
  pretty sure it is n't even remotely in the interest of serbia to take them in economically . 
  it would be like western germany joining together with eastern germany . 
  except if the western germany was on the economical level of eastern germany and easter germany was on the economical level of albania . 
  where does it say that in the article ? 
  all it says is that the federal goverment said it 's not `` rechtlich bindend '' aka legally binding . 
  all i can read is that the judges and the government maybe do n't agree . 
  they took some quoutes saying `` that the federal government is n't the same opinion as the house of representatives is n't anything new . '', 
  and some spd guy then said `` we did n't meet the wishes of the turks . 
  but if that is now the bridge over which you can walk , it 's all right with me . '', 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrejotkhxlc yeeeahhh, 
  cheese, 
  no i know we lost with serbia thats like -10 but what about hungary , bosnia and slovenia ', 
  i 'll trade you 4 \u010devapi and 1 burek for our spy . 
  well it 's mostly because the big game consumers , american , canada , australia , uk , germany , france ca n't really find someone to agree with . 
  whos the good and who the bad guys ? 
  the conflicts way too convoluted to make a game out of because games have to have a good guy . 
  because the average retard needs everything spelled out for him . 
  press forward to move forward etc. . . 
  did we lose some reputation with our neighbors because of this ? 
  can someone remind me how they 're in nato again with these kinds of remarks ? 
  thats like germany saying to the us hey guys i think your special forces afghanistan are terrorists . 
  so when does this brexit happen then ? 
  i 've been hearing about it for months yet they have n't even begun the start of the exit . 
  well questionable . 
  germany is rich by itself and can afford to pay one of the most expensive electricity bills in the world . 
  so germans can actually afford to use solar pv or wind and pay for it . 
  germans pay 32.04 us cents per kwh thats huge compared to say hungaries 23.44 us cents per kwh bulgarians pay 13.38 us cents ... as you can see electricity costs 3 times as much in german then it does in bulgaria . 
  and bulgaria unlike germany has to use ac for most of the summer . 
  same goes for most souther nations where acs are mandatory in this crazy heat we 're getting these days 35 \u00b0 c. . . 
  but heres the thing . 
  take poland an emerging economy full of potential . 
  http://www.green-x.at/rs-potdb/4-2.jpg theres literally no wind in poland . 
  http://solargis.com/assets/graphic/free-map/dni/solargis-europe-dni-solar-resource-map-en.png there no sun in poland . 
  http://geni.org/globalenergy/library/renewable-energy-resources/europe/hydropower/europe_files/4-1-101.gif theres no rivers that support hydro in poland ( hydro is generally maxed out in europe anyways ) so what is poland supposed to do ? 
  pay 3 times as much for it compared to say portugal or greece or italy ? 
  use wind ? 
  theres no wind . 
  too bad the start cost is massive . 
  only high tech giant nations can actually compete in something like that . 
  germany/china/us being the prime examples of pv technology . 
  it ai n't the point if they 're arab or not . 
  they identify like that while nobody in sudan does . 
  they do n't want to be ruled by them . 
  they want their own non islamic/arab country . 
  croatia always topping the charts . 
  to think i lived in the czech republic !, 
  i would have never toped the charts there ... 
  i ca n't tell is that a lot or not in ireland ? 
  so basically nothing that someone else ca n't replace yes ? 
  are these even high paying jobs ? 
  because where i come from tech support and customer service is a low paying job with no education required ... 
  same with sales . 
  so that leaves finance jobs right ? 
  same ... 
  i lived in the cz for years and so did my father and he had a ton of friends there . 
  okay someone who knows . 
  what jobs does apple provide in ireland ? 
  yeah thats probably your reaction when your night clubs play ceca and co, 
  when i was in the cz a guy claimed you guys invented slivovice . 
  and my father simply said . 
  if you did why do you call your \u0160ljiva \u0160vestka ?
