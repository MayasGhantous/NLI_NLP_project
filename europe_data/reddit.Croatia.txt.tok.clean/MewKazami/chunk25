  define book . 
  i read like 3 of the free eu things we ordered here about the state of the eu . 
  is that a book ? 
  how thik does a book have to be to be classified a book ? 
  i read light novels like this . 
  https://www.bookdepository.com/spice-wolf-novel-v-8-isuna-hasekura/9780316245463 is this a book ? 
  wow it 's reaaaly impressive if it won over all of these . 
  especially the scar and arx 160, 
  well obviously . 
  also not germany norway and switzerland thats where the hdi be at . 
  i 'm talking about our local hungarians in croatia . 
  they do n't seem to care too much they 're here and not in hungary . 
  they 're all dual lingual and a lot of them have croatian names too . 
  100 % non biased source kek, 
  well it 's hard to say but in the case of kosovo serbia it 's that serbia considers kosovo it 's cradle so to say . 
  it 's littered with old ortodox monuments and for some time it was the `` center '' of serbian culture since one of their dynasties consider it their capital province . 
  now in the ottoman empire some albanians moved there . 
  now you ca n't really tell who was actually in the majority in the 19th century because everyone claims it 's their guys . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_kosovo#19th_century as you can see the numbers are all over the place . 
  but basically thats the story . 
  balkan conflicts are based on the fact that during the ottoman rules a lot of people moved elsewhere . 
  and when it fell apart everyone claimed territory was theirs based on the people living there . 
  albanians claimed kosovo serbians claimed bosnia . 
  croatians claimed bosnia . 
  etc. . . 
  it did n't help that serbs/croats/bosnians where orthodox/catholic/muslim ... and then in the yugoslav wars it was the same thing . 
  you had villages in croatia that were up to 100 % serbian . 
  but oddly enough you also had 100 % hungarians villages and you still have them in vojvodina ( serbia ) and slavonia ( croatia ) . 
  yet for some reason croats/serbs always want the territory where they live . 
  hungarians seem to be perfectly fine living outside of hungary but being hungarian . 
  you see the same things happening todaay in africa . 
  since african borders were n't made with ethnic states in mind but with colonial territories you have mass genocide and attempts to drive away one people from a territory away so you can claim it . 
  the most recent conflict of such is sudan . 
  sudanese arabs are 70 % of what is today sudan as you can guess they 're muslim . 
  meanwhile the state that broke away south sudan is mostly made of nilotic peoples that are christan or dinka religon . 
  so if a virus attacks the italian dna it automatically slides down the spiral of past ... doom, 
  a powerful american weapon : the spread of false stories, 
  romania = roms = gypsies = cigani the vast majority of people experiencing negative things about bulgarians/romanians is gypsie related . 
  http://tarekfatah.com/muslims-shouldnt-pray-to-for-victory-over-non-muslims-my-appeal-to-islamic-clerics-in-the-toronto-sun/  one of the reasons i avoid attending friday congregations at mosques is a specific ritual supplication uttered by imams at many mosques in canada and around the world , just prior to our formal friday community prayer , the juma\u2019a . 
  in the supplication , the cleric prays to allah for , among other things , to grant `` muslims victory over the ` qawm al-kafiroon , ''' the arabic phrase that lumps all non-muslims -- jews , hindus , christians , atheists , buddhists and sikhs -- into one derogatory category , the `` kuffar '' , or non-muslims . 
  this supplication is not obligatory . 
  not uttering this prayer would in no way adversely affect the holiness or solemnness of the collective community prayer . 
  i have long argued with my orthodox and conservative muslim friends and family that at least when living among non-muslims , we should avoid praying for their defeat at the hands of muslims . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf4mse3zany this is a muslim not some random storm fronter . 
  it 's not extreme to want extremist or islamism out of your country . 
  this is the secular `` muslim '' everyone keeps talking about . 
  yet nobody wants to hear them out . 
  they 're warning everyone . 
  yet they 're literally ignored look how they mock him in the canadian senate literally memeing him with `` not all muslims '' `` muslims are the best people i met bla bla '', 
  it is but they 're broke as fuck . 
  mikoyan , ilyushin , irkut , sukhoi , tupolev , and yakovlev are n't ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tupolev_tu-204#tu-204sm considering the world stage they 're basically the only real opposition to boeing/airbus together with embraer from brazil . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_jet_airliners list of literally all airliners used today . 
  look at how tiny it is . 
  sort by number built a sense of scale on how huge the market share of boeing/airbus is . 
  so can i got there i can get a flight for like 20 $ ? 
  i do n't get the airplane part . 
  they can design a fucking t-50 yet not an airliner ? 
  what the fuck, 
   the seaside is amazing http://kingofwallpapers.com/koper/koper-008.jpg yeaaah maybe to look at . 
  everything in koper is overfilled with that fucking sea weed ... 
  gib v5 we need in, 
  basically v4 + balts want it because they feel america has lost strength and russia is openly does shit with no repercussion except sanctions . 
  and now that tukey is going batshit insane nato is even more questionable ... so everybody wants an alliance . 
  and honestly i think we 'll see it because just about everyone these days speaks english as you can see here . 
  so as generations grow up with a common language and culture a more integrated european army is a possibility . 
  sorry i should have typed t3 trams . 
  i have no idea what city is actually the smallest . 
  overall trams are way less expensive compared to busses long term . 
  the prime example is that these old t3 are still used or refurbished while busses would literally rot away . 
  for example we have a law here in croatia that busses must be replaced every i think it 's 7 years ? 
  i 've seen at least 4 or 5 busses models come and go since the 90s but the trains and trams say the same . 
  we have the same trains for 50 years https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rolling_stock_of_the_croatian_railways american general electric locomotives from the 1972 still humming every night in my city . 
  same with the t3 see my post above . 
  refurbished and make to look nice but the motors are still the same . 
  we use them still . 
  well we made ours a bit more pretty but it 's still the same t3yu motor and everything basically a refurbished t3 . 
  it 's called the t3r.pv now and looks like this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_osijek https://puu.sh/qmnqc/71f89900e0.jpg or https://puu.sh/qmnro/206912cbd6.jpg or https://puu.sh/qmnrg/49ba26d0d3.jpg if you ca n't tell we love putting big advertisements on them . 
  technically we 're way to small of a city for a tram network but it 's been tradition for 150 years and people really like them ... 
  this germany city and osijek are by far the smallest cities to use trams https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/schwerin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osijek, 
  i mean i know it should be shocking to me that such a high profile company thats respected everywhere in the world does this kind of shit but it 's not . 
  we have our own scandals here with the hypo bank constantly bribing out politicians for a good 10 years ... 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc6qant506w this is a good one here . 
  germans , turks , bosnians , italians unite against gypsies in their neighborhood . 
  also this is exactly what everyones that has lived near gypsies is telling everyone else . 
  they 're a special kind of people ... 
  to be fair that 13 english ones in croatia is tourist asking for advice or what to do ... that happens pretty often . 
  maybe it 's a new media fad where they call lone wolf terrorist mentally ill people and disregard their motives as trivial . 
  but then they report on how he played umm ... 
  counter strike go or wow and want to ban that . 
  because video games are obviously here to blame not islamic indoctrination or islam . 
  the sad thing is thats probably going to happen . 
  and they 're gon na join before bosnia and serbia kek, 
  so many, 
  and how was this exactly in any way disproven ? 
  what ? 
  ca n't understand a simple sentence . 
  your world must be shits n giggles all day . 
  wow i was n't aware fucking reddit subreddits where just one person . 
  i mean everyone here is just me posting . 
  and the only other person on this subreddit is you .
