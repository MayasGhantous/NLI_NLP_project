  and i 'm like it wo n't . 
  old cities do n't need to build new buildings . 
  the old ones are perfectly fine can be retrofired for a fraction of the cost . 
  thanks for the waifus serbro, 
  empire wins again as expected, 
  i personally consider japan to be my closest ally thanks for the waifus, 
  fuck that i want austro-hungary vs serbia !, 
  last time i checked we saved western europe from muslims for say 700 years ? 
  9/10 empire when ; _ ; http://puu.sh/pqmbc/ba48050771.png, 
  obviously integration is genocide to dumb albanian shitposters . 
  wow you sure czechia should n't be actually called captain obvious ? 
  no fucking way are we 4 % when every major city now has both plastics and paper separately picked up . 
  this is probably like a 5 year old map or more ... 
  i really want to see a documentary on at least one of these crazy built in the middle of nowhere on a cliff castles . 
  how on earth did they dod it . 
  that had to take decades ... 
  yes eu a new soviet union . 
  sure ... 
  he sure made some well researched video . 
  i do n't think serbia had a marshal plan yet it lost 16.67 % to 27.78 % of it 's pop in ww1 and then some 6.63 to 10.97 in ww2 and they recovered . 
  yes . 
  you have their teritory in glass and they 'd cut your population by 50 % or more but losses in ww2 prove that you can recover from that within 50 years . 
  you 're saying this as if this is done by the flip of a finger and wo n't involve billions of traceable dollars , dozens of traceable agents and so on ... oh gee we just have to reach the point where everyone is sick and thats it . 
  nothing more . 
  easy pzy . 
  you 're telling me here that middle eastern countries , turkey , poland , romania posses technology to make these types of weapons ? 
  if russia did a first strike with tac nukes . 
  how would these agents leave their respective facilities ? 
  how would these facilities survive exactly ? 
  oh they 're deep down a mountain . 
  yeah and i 'm sure the fsb does n't know about them . 
  do you really think anyone except china , america , russia , advanced eu , south korea and japan have the technology to produce this ? 
  poland ? 
  romania ? 
  turkey . 
  please most middle eastern nations do n't manufacture their own fucking personal arms . 
  they 're all bought from america or russia or europe ... 
  they have no arms industry in the middle east . 
  the only country that has one is turkey because they 're the only nation that actually had experience with wars in the past . 
  real industrial wars and knows that having your own supply of equipment is the only way to survive an actual war . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biological_warfare#list_of_bw_institutions.2c_programs.2c_projects_and_sites_by_country look at iraq they had a bw division . 
  and what did they cook up ? 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/botulinum_toxin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anthrax https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aflatoxin none of these are the imaginary super duper viruses you pretend exist inside population centers right now to be spread by agents . 
  if it was 2 billion to 144 million russia would still win any war because none of the said countries have nukes . 
  look at israel 8 million people . 
  surounded by a mindblowing 403 million . 
  they 're on bad terms with all of them . 
  every country in this list here wants to see israel go . 
  yet surprise surprise they 're still there . 
  i wonder why . 
  could it be the nukes ? 
  it 's how christian you actually are, 
  technically one is . 
  http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/blogs/future-development/2015/02/11-poland-post-socialist-transition-piatkowski/chart_pdf1.jpg?la=en very possible . 
  well that was baraya at it 's multi cultural height . 
  after that wars followed and ethnic displacements of one kind or another . 
  all of these people lived together and then they were basically moved around so you get ops situation . 
  i 'm not quite sure why economies need to grow and grow and grow . 
  i mean i get form an economic standpoint . 
  but thats not sustainable . 
  the money for growing has to come from somewhere and it 's usually not the country it 's from . 
  a country only grows while in a development phase . 
  most non-communist european countries have long passed that cycle and are not in a cycle where basically they 're trying to keep the economy stable . 
  germany is obviously siphoning `` growth '' from other eu countries such as france , italy and the uk . 
  governments should focus on the well being of the people and their happiness not some artificial numbers that do n't indicate a lot . 
  the us is a great example of this where you basically killed the middle class to get `` better numbers '' oh look at all this growth . 
  sure apple is swimming in money but whats apple going to do with that money ? 
  invest in overseas manufacturing and rnd ? 
  high tech companies are a real shit deal when it comes to wealth redistribution . 
  since they 're usually made of low numbers of highly educated workers . 
  and tons of money gets siphoned off by stocks too ... america is basically the poor and the rich now . 
  at least in europe wealth is more equality distributed and you have social healthcare and school systems . 
  it 's almost as if we lived in a huge empire . 
  and it 's almost as if croatian baranya had the most diverse cultural background . 
  in 1910 , the population of southern ( present-day croatian ) part of baranja numbered 50,757 people , of whom : [ 3 ] 20,313 ( 40.0 % ) spoke the hungarian language 13,577 ( 26.7 % ) spoke the german language 6,194 ( 12.2 % ) spoke the serbian language ( * ) 1,888 ( 3.7 % ) spoke the croatian language ( * ) 58 spoke the slovak language 2 spoke the romanian language some 8,725 ( 17.2 % ) spoke other languages , in this case the \u0160okac language ( * ) ( * ) total number of speakers of south slavic languages ( serbian , croatian , and \u0160okac ) in croatian baranja can be estimated at around 15,000 ( 29.6 % ) . 
  corruption , mismanagement , incapable economist and politicians . 
  we have an unsustainable level of living . 
  the whole country is living above it 's standards and no one wants to make cuts , so we 're basically slowly sinking just like the greeks were 7 years ago . 
  but our ship is small and lenders are plentiful . 
  so we 're still sailing ... 
  there is two scenarios . 
  we 'll continue down this path of no progress and growth and simply slowly stagnate building up dept as we go . 
  or there is going to be another global crisis and we 're gon na sink quickly as the dept chains pull is down . 
  i am envious i wish we had at least positive growth ... 
  well that was just post soviet collapse i 'm sure a lot of firm were struggling at that time for financial reasons . 
  was n't that radar on the mig-31 something incredible ? 
  yeah by quite a bit . 
  i 'm looking at a website in serbia . 
  no idea how accurate it is . 
  424,81 $ for an 6700k in serbia . 
  http://www.pcberza.rs/detaljnije/modulus/68-4421/ 341.09 $ for an 6700k in croatia . 
  http://www.edigital.hr/intel/intel-core-i7-40ghz-lga1151-8mb-%28i7-6700k%29-box-procesor-p495431.html?bid=&amp;partner=10001 no idea what shops i should use for serbia . 
  i for one look forward to this . 
  seeing the marvels they produced in space and avionics . 
  they 're at cutting edge military technology yet everywhere else they 're unknown . 
  i always asked myself why they were so behind on just general consumer goods . 
  they have the know-how of a very educated work force . 
  but i guess 100 years of communism does n't go by just like that . 
  brands needs to be build , the mindset of the people too . 
  germany has some 100 years of brands , and know-how and they never stopped producing consumer goods .
