  prices did n't change for that .

  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw8dnstf3te oh shit you 're in bulgaria, 
  we have chain bakery http://www.mlinar.hr/en but it 's already outside of croatia so that probably does n't count ... 
  but yeah my country usually prefers to eat at local restaurants and small businesses over say mcdolands . 
  i 'll never understand how mcdolands ever survives here in croatia considering 1 $ gets you a cheeseburger and 2 $ gets you this guys 3 times the size hamburger https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihmb3hol9aq this also here in serbia https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mllqainhxwo you literally get 3 times the size for 1/3 of the price . 
  croatia dog - vau vau cat - mijau mijau cow - muuuuu horse - njihaaa donkey - iiiiii-aaaaa rooster - kukuriku chicken - kokodak ko ko sheep - bee / mee goat - bee / mee pig - rok rok duck - kva-kva pigeon - gooo-gooo frog - kva-kva / kre-kre, 
  so it 's not turk blood ; _ ;, 
  what about croats ? 
  are we ? 
  do n't worry former yugos love you . 
  we 'll fill you right up . 
  no but seriously since we entered the eu 12.185 croats left for ireland . 
  it might not seem like much at first but we 're about the same size as you guys . 
  personally i know like 10 + people that went there . 
  sounds familiar . 
  if i was n't so poor i 'd gold you . 
  so take this as a poor person gave me imaginary reddit gold . 
  america first . 
  germany second . 
  yeah i can agree with that order . 
  gay pride 101, 
  croatia when ; _ ;, 
  explain this to me . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/energy_in_croatia total installed capacity of generating objects built in croatia amounts to 3745 mw , 2079 mw of which is hydropower 's share , and 1666 mw comes from thermal power plants . 
  there are 25 hydroelectric power plants , most of which are located on the coast ( including the single pumped storage hydroelectric plant , rhe velebit ) , and 7 thermal power stations , 3 of which also generate heat for industry and heating in cities . 
  also , 338 mw is available from the co-owned kr\u0161ko nuclear power plant , and 210 mw from the privately owned plomin 2 thermal power plant . 
  [ 2 ] in 2009 , domestic production amounted to 12015 gwh , which was 67.9 % of total domestic demand . 
  remaining 32.1 % was covered through trade . 
  total consumption equaled 17697 gwh , a 1 % decrease from 2008 . 
  how in the world is renewable only 25 % on this map ? 
  when literally over a half of our electricity generation is by hydro ? 
  what are they counting here ? 
  is gas for cars/trucks/ships counted ? 
  i do n't understand at all ... 
  germany : w-w-we 're going solar i swear . 
  0 emissions guys !, 
  totally carbon free !, 
  meanwhile in france . 
  flat is never `` truly '' owned because you ca n't edit a lot of stuff . 
  but thats just my opinion . 
  i actually lived in the czech republic . 
  and lived in one of the commie flats in uherske hradiste . 
  my father wanted to move the kitchen to another spot but it simply could n't be done because of the piping . 
  literally everybody here owns a house , i always found it weird not to own something where you live . 
  it feel so incredibly limiting . 
  guess you 're playing some sort of mix of eco and tycoon in anno 2070, 
  oh boy thats one of the primary things i notice in high income economies . 
  you cities are almost always cleaner . 
  yeah but it slowly ramped up ... 
  i do n't remember it being this bad in say 2008, 
  yes , he actually became quite good with the sarcasm and shitalk in recent years . 
  so videos like this are worth the watch if you ask me . 
  ango media is in full clickbait mode since around 2015 but now that they lost two major political battles they 're going totally berserk . 
  i do n't even watch pewdiepie . 
  the reason i know what i know is because of the simple fact hes famous but https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgx2mj6ibs0, 
  welcome to the age of clickbait !, 
  ( well technically it 's been going on this whole year ), 
  all i can see is http://www.unpret.ro/files/oferte/45/e/vand-lel-detergent-automat-si-1010269.jpg, 
  same . 
  what an odd choice too . 
  at least give them \u0160tarks best wishes or something . 
  this is how retarded media/politics is now yes . 
  how about they report on quarterly gdp and how to make it better instead of this dogshit ? 
  how about we care for living standards and not `` free '' chocolate . 
  retarded . 
  thats the slavic world for gypsies . 
  in much of continental europe , romanies are known by names related to the greek term \u03c4\u03c3\u03b9\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 ( tsinganoi ) https://puu.sh/sfbl4/03067664b2.jpg  dissimilated form of earlier zingano , most likely from a greek term meaning `` untouchable '' i does make me wonder if this alludes to their indian origins of being basically untouchable outcastes of some hinduist system . 
  no they 're actually quite significant changes over even 30 years . 
  look at this one in peru https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3rez-mso54, 
  that 's the problem that used to be how the river looked like in 1946 i think see rivers arent static landmarks they shift, 
  we do . 
  well only hungary has it 's own decent airforce with decent planes . 
  everyone else is at mig 21 level, 
  before croats come here and post this . 
  http://orig02.deviantart.net/86c1/f/2015/038/6/7/alternative_coat_of_arms_of_croatia_by_fenn_o_manic-d8h0p04.png it 's the dalmatian coat of arms https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/coat_of_arms_of_croatia_and_dalmatia_1495.svg it 's not lions . 
   the most widely used version is azure , with three crowned golden leopards ' heads affront\u00e9s caboshed or , langued in gules ( three golden lion heads , facing front , with golden crowns and red tongues , on a blue shield ) , often crowned . 
  this variant dates from at least the very late 14th century , found on the great seal of king sigismund of luxembourg ( 1395-1437 ) . 
  the republic of venice in its great arms ( 18th century ) used a variant with the same charge , but on a gules ( red ) shield , with the tongues often gold rather than gules . 
  between 1815 and 1918 , the crowned variant of this coat of arms , with the azure shield , was used by the habsburg kingdom of dalmatia . 
  it was lions before . 
  now it 's leopards . 
   from a strictly heraldic point of view the charges on the arms are not lions but heraldic leopards . 
  the heraldic leopard differs from the real-life leopard ( panthera pardus ) . 
  it does not have any spots and often has a mane . 
  therefore , in heraldry , the leopard is generally similar , and is often referred to as a lion ( panthera leo ) . 
  the reason for this lies in the fact that in the middle ages leopards were thought to be a crossbreed between a lion and a pard, 
  well it 's more sorting then recycling . 
  helps them burn it really . 
  but yeah i guess it 's differs from place to place . 
  different special wards have different collection rules i guess too . 
  got ta love mobile phones autocorrect, 
  i went to japan and i have a friend living there . 
  they actually just recycle pet bottles , aluminim cans and glass bottles . 
  go to any kombini , 7/11 , sankasu , family markt , aeon , lawnson , seika and you get a free plastic bag for anything you get . 
  we had to carry a shitload of trash in our bags because there no trash bins anywhere .
