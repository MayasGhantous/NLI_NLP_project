  at home you need to separate trash into burnable non-burnable oversited bottles/cans also paper is sometimes left out as it 's own category http://jpninfo.com/9826 you 'd think wow look at japan they 're recycling everything . 
  wrong . 
  it all gets burned in so called `` fluidized bed combustion '' check more here . 
  http://www.env.go.jp/en/recycle/smcs/attach/swmrt.pdf there is literally a trash powerplant in shibuya in the middle of tokyo https://puu.sh/spufy/1beae578b7.jpg the problem is burnable trash is like paper trash we 'd recycle here in europe say you hate a simple sandwitch you got in a paper bag . 
  thats now burnable because it has food residue etc. . . 
  did it really translate like that to you ? 
  it 's actually `` seagull '' - `` galeb '' and well super seagull http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wy7z7lpaapo/s8ailby4pai/aaaaaaaaa6y/ogkzftgolpq/s1600/steven-seagull.jpg first one is `` northern goshawk '' - `` jastreb '' second oneis `` eagle '' - `` orao '', 
  it 's kind of funny i know both are just flying things that shoot stuff and electronics are way more imporant today . 
  but the f-16 are basically 40 years old now .

  kind of blows ones mind ... 
  you mean i posted before the edit ? 
  he man, 
   all the chancellors of the spd served for 20 years pretty sure not a single on served 20 years . 
  better reword that . 
  why ca n't the subsidize gas ? 
  not fucking coal . 
  at least pick the lesser of the 2 evils . 
  so you 're telling me kosovo is only 10 % and albania is 34 % ?

  i guess the guys who made this graph took bribes too . 
  i do n't feel it anywhere . 
  this collapse of the eu . 
  brits always hated it so brexit did n't come as too big of a suprise . 
  but i do n't see any germans or french of any of the smaller members saying anything radical . 
  man new york times is on a spree today ... dave we need more trump bashing articles per minute , dig something up !,

  but i think the guys here got it . 
  but you 're right question would be `` would you mind '' if your x was x,

  household wealth is also a bad measure because that factors in property .

  london is a great example of this where pensioners get miserable living conditions yet their houses are worth insane prices . 
  muh commonwealth .
