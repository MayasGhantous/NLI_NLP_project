  http://images.freeimages.com/images/premium/previews/5362/53628816-hand-showing-number-3-clipping-path.jpg because if not hurr durr look hes a serb . 
  except ireland, 
  what kind of country does n't make it 's own ice cream ? 
  no you need to pay . 
  overpriced food and overpriced drinks and overpriced everything . 
  but you 'd still bring 50 cans with you anyways . 
  yes usually from what i 've read around 20ish you first experience reduce tolerance and then maybe even intolerance . 
  well it 's not really intolerance it 's just extremely reduced tolerance . 
  i 'm also wondering about it . 
  i asked my doctor about some test , she says they 're not doing any . 
  maybe i should research it a bit more ... maybe someone somewhere is doing some . 
  i usually buy whats cheapest between these . 
  http://www.mojosijek.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tramvaj.jpg we still use these old german ones . 
  i tried it all . 
  it all tastes like water with something in it . 
  not very milk like at all . 
  it 's not that different but i still sometimes get the umm shitters from it . 
  for some reason ... maybe i 'm also allergic to something in it . 
  yet oddly lactostop works . 
  i do n't think you can do stepless entry on the old ones because of the drive train . 
  the new ones have all the equipment on their roofs . 
  http://www.explore-zagreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/zagreb-tram1-1030x643.jpg if you look at these from zagreb you can see it has tons of equipment up top . 
  the funny thing is they still sound the same . 
  the acceleration sound . 
  we do but honestly i prefer to just take lactostop . 
  it 's not so much about milk . 
  i can still drink lactose free like you said . 
  it 's about yogurts , ice creams , cheeses and so on ... 
  i did god it taste disgusting . 
  but it 's not only milk i 'm sorry for it basically everything sold in refrigerators in a super market . 
  yogurt , yogurt-drink , cheeses i love cheese , ice cream , ricemilch just so much ... 
  but it 's okay it costs a lot but lactostop works to an extent . 
  japan 0.0 % malta 0.0 % palestine 0.0 % seems like samurais and crusaders do n't rape it seems . 
  i used to be one of them 213 . 
  hell i drank more then 1 liter a day . 
  then fucking lactose intolerance happened at 26 . 
  i 'd say impressive but they did the same thing here . 
  http://www.urbanrail.net/eu/hr/osijek/depot1.jpg changed into https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/osijek%2c_trg_ante_star%c4%8devi%c4%87a%2c_tramvaj.jpg/1200px-osijek%2c_trg_ante_star%c4%8devi%c4%87a%2c_tramvaj.jpg it looks a bit better but it 's still the same engine . 
  you 'd think there would be a huge anti immigrant sentiment in croatia going by this lol ... 
  yes but learning wo n't put food on the table or buy that new iphone or 3000 $ pc . 
  meanwhile an it degree will do all of that . 
  but only if you work in western europe . 
  here in eastern we get 1000 $ a month if we 're lucky . 
  so a funny name , a turkish name , a jewish name and a greek god . 
  amazing . 
  thats because they 're decent people . 
  we have some here in croatia . 
  like you said the culture is closer . 
  one of my university profesors was an ukranian woman . 
  she was nice , spoke a bit weird but normal . 
  why not get people who assimilate ? 
  ukrainians are in a war ? 
  the whole of eastern europe has free travel to germany . 
  i 'm pretty sure 2 million ukranians would pack up and go to germany if they invited them in a year . 
  why does the eu care so much about uneducated , male , 16-30 year old , unemployable migrants ? 
  why ca n't we be realistic like australia ? 
  is it just me or does this look horrible ? 
  so they 're literally removing kebab ? 
  it 's hillarious that they always defend it like that . 
  germany has tough bread so nutella is more solid , silly southerns use soft bread . 
  yet 95 % of my nutella use is on crepes . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4v2hj0mdd7e more ae86s, 
  okay finally somewhere i can ask . 
  whats with the odd spots ? 
  why does parts of romania/hungary/serbia get so much more sunshine then the rest ? 
  what is the weird line that goes from fance to ukraine ? 
  wh does it cover nearly half of germany and czechia/slovakia ? 
  is there a reason for this ? 
  jet stream ? 
  weather paterns ? 
  what is it ? 
  doubt it . 
  still have to pay 25 % import tax on my anime figures plus some bullshit post fees because `` they had to deliver it to the customs '' that equals another 10 % literally . 
  so it 's 35 % of the original price plus shipping . 
  thats officially . 
  how many irreligious people is there that do n't do anything religious ? 
  see that does n't do anything . 
  i fucking love serb humor way better then croatian . 
  also it 's pretty much everyone the same shit here . 
  religion is really the only difference . 
  no see i met a lot of germans online and i can jokingly call them nazis and they 're fine with it . 
  i do n't think a lot of italians would mind being called mafia . 
  since both of these things are to be honest pretty `` cool '' . 
  english food is disgusting even the english agree . 
  it 's revolting just like all of the northerner food . 
  pickled fish ? 
  chips with vinegar ? 
  salt candy with licorice ? 
  all of it disgusting and very much a very acquired taste . 
  the problem is what do i ask you ? 
  do you have roads ? 
  do you sleep in a bunker ? 
  pretty sure you 'll get mad at that . 
  why ? 
  because you take shit at face value and ca n't tell when someone is joking and someone is not . 
  the whole point of this is ... you guys ca n't take jokes !, 
  i can be like ahaha yeah we sure killed a lot of serbs/jews/gypsies in our ustasha times . 
  croatia does n't have roads ? 
  with the state they 're in we might as well not call em roads ... you guys are like fuck you albania is great how dare you make jokes !,
