   if i tell you croats are motherfucking bastards probably true mate . 
  probably true . 
   dumbass . 
  do you think the average albanian is in a blood feud btw ? 
  is ever muslim a terrorist ? 
  but if it happens and it 's absurd you get famous for it . 
  not my fault i 've half of the documentaries i 've seen about albania are about just that . 
  getting better , nice people if they 're native , worst diaspora in history . 
  instantly insulted when you mention albania in a negative light or albanians . 
  they have drug growing villages with their own armies . 
  blood fued forever . 
  not really let me explain . 
  most of the balkan population owns housing . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate actually so do czechs . 
  so say you can get a 500 $ job here . 
  you do n't pay for housing , you only pay utilities . 
  you get to pocket 400 $ as `` disposable income '' . 
  meanwhile if you in the czechia . 
  say you earn 1000 $ about 40 ~ 50 % of that is going to go for housing and utilities right ? 
  so you 're down to 500 $ maybe it 's more say 600 $ if you 're in a more remote city or less in you 're in prauge say 400 $ . 
  you 're basically at the same point . 
  meanwhile if you go to say sweden . 
  you earn 2000 $ a month about 50 % of that goes for housing so you 're left with 1000 $ . 
  now you might say `` ah yes but cost of living in sweden is sky high '' well yes if you like to party and go to bars . 
  but food is pretty much around the same , so is clothes . 
  but heres the catch . 
  all the modern day luxuries cost the same around the eu . 
  so mobile phones , playstations , cars , tvs ... all the tech people like to brag about more or less costs the same no matter where you live . 
  video games for example cost the same in czechia and germany yet the wages are vastly different . 
  and this is why people move to more prosperous countries . 
  simply look up car statistics how often do czecha buy new cars compared to germany , french or swedish people . 
  yes but so far there has been quite a lot of them with nukes and nobody fucked up because they do n't want to get turned into glass by the others . 
  and how is that bad ? 
  you think russia would fuck with ukraine if they had nukes ? 
  i think not . 
  iran getting nukes would balance out the middle east . 
  and if egypt and sa got them it would balance it even more . 
  look at pakistan/india them having nukes has basically stooped a war that was 100 % bound to happen but it did n't . 
  as controversial as it is and as dumb as it sounds . 
  nukes have done more for world peace then anything ever . 
  the idea of developing new weapons was always to `` stop wars '' ... 
  the gatling gun was supposed to replace troops on the battlefield and make it so there was less casualties . 
  nukes are the only weapon that was so insane that nobody dared to use it after 2 small ones were deployed . 
  i lived in czechia , my father lived there 15 years until he came back . 
  i speak czech etc. . anyways i feel tons of ex-yugo ( balkans in general ) guys would come to czechia but they want a much higher living standard . 
  so they all leave for sweden or ireland etc. . . czechia is perfectly fine . 
  but the living standard is very much comparable to ours here . 
  so is the culture and everything . 
  we still very much stay in contact with some people there . 
  one guy told us `` man these kaufland employees are getting arrogant . 
  they know they ca n't lose the job '', 
  it would n't be an arms race for you guys really . 
  it would be for us . 
  you have a 7000 nukes and about 2000 active . 
  menwhile eu total if the uk leaves has 300 . 
  and thats only france . 
  i 'd say we need more . 
  and honestly south korea and japan owning nukes would be a good thing . 
  they 're both responsible nations that need a threat reduction from china . 
  just look what happened when israel sort of admitted it had nukes . 
  suddenly it 's safe . 
  good . 
  i do n't see why not . 
  mad is still the best defense by far . 
  pretty sure i 'll see headlines in the future about it . 
   albania does n't mind serbia joining yeah i would n't count on that . 
  this sounds fair . 
  check out these http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2014/03/the-beauty-of-japans-artistic-manhole-covers/, 
  yeah but thats 10 years away . 
  to be fair that is n't going to be ready for at least a decade . 
  because the track for it is n't going to be built until 2027 the earliest . 
  and who knows what china or others will do by then . 
  smaller distances ? 
  i think they 're on average 500-800 km long . 
  how long are the french ones ? 
  from what i googled french ones seem to be more along the line of 300-500 km long . 
  ohhh now this is something i did n't know about !, 
  why is it that french trains looks so unimpressive compared to japanese ones ? 
  yet are faster ?

  and i 'm sure nato tanks are going to go rolling in on them ... russia has tons of investments in france , germany and uk . 
  if you ever see something spelled ridiculously like that it 's probably sarcasm . 
  thick as greek yogurt, 
  but what if the ancient macedonians were actually slav . 
  we wuz kangs . 
  for how much ? 
  because i pay 35 kuna for 3 gb on tele2, 
  what part of this was alt right ? 
  as my worldviews are very left leaning . 
  let 's do it compare outself . 
  https://8values.github.io/ here take this test . 
  these are my results . 
  https://i.imgur.com/jnacfpc.jpg very interesting how people seem to view `` you do n't like immigration '' `` you do n't agree with me '' as alt-right . 
  in what way am i right ? 
  if anything i 'm balanced , except for religion that should fuck off and be taxed like the rest the institutions and i like technology a lot so that makes me in that chart very `` progressive '' i guess . 
  i am literally a sdp voting leftist . 
  in croatia out of all places . 
  pc culture , muslim immigration and crazy left and greedy right feeding it more and more . 
  gays and trans etc are okay but they do n't get equality of outcome they get equality of opportunity . 
  programing a too male oriented sector ?
