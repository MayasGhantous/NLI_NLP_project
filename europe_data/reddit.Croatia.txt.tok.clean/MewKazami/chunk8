  it 's pretty expensive . 
  i mean it 's pretty cool too i had a sub there for a few months . 
  but in the end it was too expensive for me . 
  it 's only the second day . 
  if i said i was n't worried i 'd be lying . 
  yes . 
  they 're being relocated constantly . 
  first from the border with serbia to asylum places and then from there on to zagreb and from there on the borders i think . 
  totally requesting asylum in bulgaria, 
  they sure are ... but you know the local politicians got ta show what they `` built '' during their last mandate . 
  so they get re-elected . 
  see that glass bridge on last picture . 
  that was like a 500.000 $ project for a fucking bridge over the rails . 
  well not sure about the price maybe it 's not that much , maybe it was but it was a joke ... http://www.arhitekti-hka.hr/files/images/novosti/2012/novosti/12_2012/osijek/01-nathodnik.jpg, 
  where to hungary and slovenia both closed borders ... as of right now they are stuck here . 
  at least for the time being . 
  and i do n't expect it to change in the next few weeks . 
  hungary is n't suddenly going to de-build it 's fences . 
  only slovenia can now change the situation . 
  and they are a very small country and justifiably afraid to be honest . 
  one small town passed through the croatian borders overnight ... 
  this is a bus station not a stop . 
  the main one for the whole slavonia region . 
  i just saw a d\u00fcsseldorf - ilok buss . 
  it 's a fucking nightmare today . 
  http://www.osijek031.com/galerija/thumbnails.php?album=2127 some more pictures, 
  yeah it 's really new like build a few years ago . 
  some famous croatian architect did it . 
  we used to joke it 's like a spaceship in the middle of a village . 
  yep , it 's only the second day so this is just the start . 
  and we 're already way over the limits . 
  how about he sends some money right now because the population of beli manastir doubled over night ? 
  when your city looks like this . 
  you 'll have a right to talk . 
  http://cdn-vps.osijek031.com/slike/novosti_2015_09/2015_09_18_izbjeglice_osijek_490_1.jpg because this a photo from mine . 
  http://puu.sh/kfohn/9e564e98ec.jpg this guy would be in a fashion magazine i swear, 
  all these poor 18-30 year old children and females . 
  technically by gypsie law these gypsies are not gypsies anymore . 
  i 'll just post my youtube comment . 
  this video has some issues  if we accepted all the refuges the muslim population would rise 4 % ~ 5 % in the eu . 
  * yes while this is nothing spectacular it sure is n't going to rise in percentage in czech republic or in poland . 
  it 's going to be very localized to germany and nordics . 
  these people like to stay together so you 're going to get syrian/muslim ghettos all over germany/nordics where they 're localized with their own parallel society such as shown here in the zdf documentary `` zdf - islam - effect on germany '' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwaikoatwm . 
  so they will get a much bigger bump in muslim population then what you indicate and it 's not just harmless . 
  for some local societies where they settle is going to mean they turn into a minority . 
  such as here happening right now ... : http://www.dw.com/en/refugee-crisis-in-bavarian-border-town-we-cant-take-them-all/a-18718368 * while birth rates do adjust on a generational level , the baseline 1st generation still has a much higher birthrate and will mean and overall percentage increase  most syrian refugees are already educated . 
  * citation required there is no concrete on statistics on this , and even if there were statistics you can only assume that it 's the same standard as it was in the country so 20 ~ 30 % of the people have a higher form of education . 
  it 's hard to tell if these people are syrian or from somewhere else as the ease of acquiring a fake syrian passport has been proven by a netherlands reporter a few days ago . 
  * while refugees do commit less crimes once they have a job , suddenly making 800.000 jobs is not easy or in any way feasible if it was all these `` jobs '' would have been taken by eastern europeans say ukranians also in a civil war . 
  as has been proven by countless reports some people are desperate and will assault and steal from then native population of the country and themselves . 
  as can be seen in that one video in hungary were the guy goes out to hand out food and they literally swarm him and steal it . 
  so maybe in 5 years they 'll be less violent but in a mass migration situation such as this crime rates are going to be high . 
  do n't pretend otherwise . 
  why are we supposed to be so generous to these foreign cultured people when we 're not 1/8th as generous to ukrainians that have 50 times more cultural similarity being a part of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth for centuries ?!, 
  holy crap !, 
  thanks for the gold it 's my first !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwaikoatwm yeah these poor civilized people . 
  i came here too looking for it . 
  since it was n't here had to post it . 
  the prevention of ghettos at keleti and so on ? 
  they 're paying 35 $ to get to \u0160id . 
  if anything they 're getting off cheap . 
  no but good old serbian mines will, 
  later that day someone found out they 're in bulgaria . 
  so the news is reporting the first 20 came . 
  http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/prve-izbjeglice-stigle-u-hrvatsku/842139.aspx notable examples of these poor war torn syrian refugees ... amadu ( 35 ) from muauritania amandu came with his freinds , they say they just want to live in a country where there is peace , in mauritania there no work . 
  mohamed kadir ( 20 ) from pakistan he comes from a place where these is no job , no food , no electricity . 
  he wants to earn money to send back to his siblings . 
  now mauritania is literally on the other side of africa . 
  pakistan is literally on the other side of asia . 
  i do n't know why you 're getting downvoted but hes right . 
  this was done by the paramilitaries in the vojna krajna . 
  that revived the mines from jna or simply took them fro the local occupied warehouses . 
  i can tell you from experience that this is true . 
  someone drunk and stuppid in the paramilitary would say let 's mine that filed over there and they 'd go and randomly plant mines . 
  no mapping was done because these people had no idea how to lay a minefield . 
  muslims must think we 're atheists or something ... 
  and so it begins ... 
  i 'm sure the usta\u0161e are going to greet them with open arms, 
  there needs to be a distinction . 
  i 'm liberal . 
  i do n't want to associated with these people . 
  call them progressives . 
  imagine a hunger strike even 100 years ago . 
  we 'd all collectively laugh at them and let them starve . 
  there is n't a quite a good chance , it 's 100 % only fancy restaurants or tourist traps have higher prices . 
  an example . 
  for 20 ~ 25 kunas aka 2.65 ~ 3.00 $ you get 10 chevapi ( 100 ~ 150g of meat ) in a homeade bread ( 200g ) with onions and sometimes they even offer kajmak . 
  example : http://www.072info.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cevapi.jpg it 's huge portion and this fills you up for the day . 
  meanwhile a big mac 18 kuna or 2.38 euros http://www.cmhager.com/downloads/big-hardee-real.jpg, 
  this . 
  one shitty hamburger costs 7 kuna here in croatia a bit less then 1 $ . 
  okay you 'd say that seems fair . 
  then you go the my nearest bakery and you can get a calzone pizza from a quality oven for 9 kuna 1.2 $ . 
  this pizza is for me enough to fill in one meal . 
  especially if it 's breakfast or dinner . 
  http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/3b/1c/17/pizza-calzone.jpg not to mention you can buy a whole burek http://trgovina.mercator.si/wcsstore/zivila/images/products/a056/2722617_large.jpg and thats 2 times as filling . 
  how can germany cut eu funds ? 
  does n't this need to be regulated by the parliament ? 
  and then approved ?
