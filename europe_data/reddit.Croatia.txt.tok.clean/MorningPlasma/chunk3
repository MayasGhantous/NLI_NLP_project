  hm , well ... 
  and that balvan revolution got part of its name from its predecessor [ yogurt revolution ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-bureaucratic_revolution ) . 
  looking at those two things in succession gives you the quick intro of why yugoslavia is no more . 
  well , austria was for quick recognition , alois mock was big friend , but wikipedia states this :  ukraine and latvia were the first to react by recognizing croatian independence in the second week of december . 
  the following week , iceland and germany recognized it , on 19 december 1991 , as the first western european countries to do so . 
  exactly . 
  we 're lucky no one gets killed this time . 
  lucky us . 
  and , on 28 june the son of the austrian president will come and inspect the troops . 
  since you wanted to know , june 22 in sisak : ( 1 ) [ battle of sisak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_sisak )  the battle of sisak ( croatian : bitka kod siska ; slovene : bitka pri sisku ; german : schlacht bei sissek ; turkish : kulpa bozgunu ) was fought on 22 june 1593 between ottoman regional forces of hasan pasha predojevi\u0107 , a notable commander ( beylerbey ) of the eyalet of bosnia , and a combined christian army from the habsburg lands , mainly kingdom of croatia and inner austria . 
  ( 2 ) [ our holiday today ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sisak_people's_liberation_partisan_detachment )  the sisak people 's liberation partisan detachment , also known as the 1st sisak partisan detachment ( serbo-croatian : sisa\u010dki narodnooslobodila\u010dki partizanski odred , 1 . 
  sisa\u010dki partizanski odred ) was the first armed anti-fascist resistance unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied yugoslavia and europe during world war ii . 
  this first detachment of the yugoslav partisans was established in occupied yugoslavia , in the brezovica forest near sisak ( in today 's croatia ) on june 22 , 1941 , the day germany invaded the soviet union . 
  it had 79 members , mainly croats with the exception of one notable serb woman , nada dimi\u0107 , and was commanded by vladimir janji\u0107-capo . 
  edit - mobile links, 
  oh , so that 's what hi-fi is ? 
  some wife fidelity index . 
  very high in croatia , only half of the women questioned cheat their partner more than once a year . 
  it 's a perfect translation . 
  you americans always complain ... and wonder what is wi-fi . 
  edit - it was dalmatian dialect , google has no chance against it . 
  eat food . 
  not too much . 
  mostly plants . 
  source - i know a guy who worked for the government . 
  no , just put lots of ukrainian flags along the way . 
    nobody asked this ,  how come it passed ? 
  we had the same thing 7 years ago in croatia . 
  the church was behind it . 
   ... tricky one . 
  one tricky from uncle sneaky . 
  makes sense . 
  yep , been in shelters in zagreb in 1991 . and then in 1995 . few things exploded 30-50 meters from me during operation storm . 
  so when 4 years later nato started bombing serbia it felt good for a moment , like they had it coming . 
  but the feeling lasted for maybe a minute . 
  i remember becoming rather sad as i knew that ordinary people would suffer and the real bastards will be safe . 
  yet , maybe they were drafted , wore uniforms and just counted days . 
  we had several guys with serbian sounding names when i was in croatian army in 1995 . 
  you stand in a line and someone calls for jankovi\u0107 , stevanovi\u0107 or similar name to come and pick something or do something . 
  mostly guys from zagreb , sisak , karlovac , ... all wearing croatian uniforms doing what we did . 
  croatian version would be horvat , many of those over here . 
  grkovi\u0107 is one of those universial names , somehow related to greece most likely as we say grk for a man from greece so maybe his ancestors were greek-catholic . 
  lots of them near zagreb in samobor and surounding area . 
  same here . 
  i do n't think foot soldiers were responsible for situation in liberated areas after the first waves of the army passed by . 
  top people were responsible , people around tu\u0111man , one of them , most of them , maybe even him ? 
  hard for me to say as he started losing his mind due to cancer and then both he and \u0160u\u0161ak died . 
  other people in the top of the government were mostly shady figures one can find only in hdz . 
  yes , there were others that should have gone to trial and answered for crimes that happened later . 
  i gave you nothing . 
  i never had anything against serbs or serbia , i still think you guys in general are great and that 's about it . 
  i 'm not comparing their families to a dog , just comparing radovan to hitler . 
  both had a softer , compationate side . 
  and yes , hitler was much worse than kara\u0111i\u0107 , just in case someone could think otherwise . 
  no i did n't . 
  i know exactly what you mean and i sad exactly what i meant . 
  but , you see , the guy was a scoundrel from his youth . 
  bastard walking over dead bodies without much remorse . 
  sociopath , probably even a psychopath . 
  pretending he was doing something for others and his nation while he was having time of his life . 
  just read his biography on wikipedia . 
  yeah , life sentence was a minimum he deserved . 
  and it was n't even zero . 
  he had to hide several years , then spent some time in hague . 
  what he did in operation storm was exceptional . 
  everybody - and i mean both sides - should feel grateful for his work . 
  all was over in four days . 
  quick end to the four year war . 
  what happened next was a crime perpetrated by bastards who later framed him and made him look as a war criminal . 
  tldr - gotovina was a hero , and hdz , then and now ruling party is basically a criminal organization . 
  a lot of my teenage/early 20s friends had polish fiat by the end of the 80s . 
  it was cheap and available . 
  now i see they were manufactured even in yugoslavia/serbia and here in croatia we called them [ pegla or peglica ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fiat_126#nicknames ) . 
   `` this is my position on titoism which i have publicly presented , '' hasanbegovic said , declining to give his opinion to reporters about ustasha leader ante pavelic . 
  i wonder why . 
  omg , u/kradem said something that makes sense . 
  the end is nigh , or someone important from uk could have died today , someone whose name starts with a letter a ? 
  most of the troublemakers on the streets of paris , bruxelles , munich and amsterdam were always from algeria and morocco . 
  at least that was my experience . 
  met a few guys from lebanon and syria ( and maybe one from tunis ) and they were all regular guys . 
   how did sdp get out of that combo ? 
  literally exorcised by croatian catholic church . 
   religion is one hell of a drug i 'm almost sure drugs were used but not religion or anything similar . 
  this guy probably drugged her , took pictures of her sucking his dick and then blackmailed her . 
  so simple and very effective with young girls . 
  especially girls with very traditional parents . 
  [ croatian submarine velebit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_submarine_velebit_ ( p-01 \\ ) \\ #decommissioning _ and_aftermath ) is missing from that list probably because it ca n't dive . 
  it would probably just sink as it ca n't even stay on the suface . 
  sailors hate it . 
  thanks for your posts . 
  good you managed to get alive from everything and hopefully without ptsp or something . 
  maybe one day you 'll be able to go to vukovar and have a beer with few guys from our side . 
  shake hands and say - never again !, 
  back then people used walkie talkies , so called motorolas to curse at each other on the oposing sides and maybe you had one . 
  now imagine if we had twitter and smartphones back then . 
  imagine all the selfies we could make ... 
  yeah , we had a beautiful day today for this time of the year . 
  [ found this photo ] ( http://www.zagreb.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/img_9625-e1477476698942.jpg ) , seems to be taken today in the [ mirogoj cemetery ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mirogoj_cemetery ) . 
  yeah , but bosnians were not that careful on weddings - [ sarajevo siege ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_sarajevo#start_of_the_war ) . 
  in europe , it 's italy , the balkans & turkey .
