albanians also do n't like it . 
  they find it offensive . 
  maybe because their neighbors use it like they use `` cigani '' for roma people ? 
  nothing wrong with the names , but they 're kind of a combo-breakers for the region , 
  well , we have a phrase `` ne da mi se '' , which i think covers the `` untranslatable '' condition . 
  ] ( http://url.geoguessr.com/5nep ) yes , i know , unfair advantage with the first one ... , 
  halfway between spanish and italian, 
  so , where 's the problem in requiring the permanent residents to know the language of the country they live in ? 
  the way my mother made popara , it ended up having a pudding-like texture , and a slight bacon-y flavour . 
  after adding some sour cream to it , it was so good that i had to stop eating it to catch a breath , 
  croatian : [ news-bar ] ( http://news-bar.hr/ ), 
  psi laju , a karavane prolaze . 
  ca n't believe no one mentioned pauwel kwak ... 
  as i see it , the problem lies in the fact that , for protesters , vukovar is n't just a city with a sizable serb minority , it represents a symbol of the war for independence . 
  my guess is that there would n't be a lot or any protests if those signs were displayed e.g. 
  in ilok or somewhere in baranja . 
  serbian also has `` nedelja '' as a word for `` week '' . 
   z\u00e1chod - toilet vs zach\u00f3d - west heh , we have this same thing with slovenes , 
   rujan does n't it actually mean `` the red one '' ? 
  interestingly enough , serbo-croatian has both `` ratnik '' ( warrior ) and `` vojnik '' ( soldier ) being regularly used, 
  of course , `` karati '' can also mean something else than `` scold '' ... 
  ... you may want to check the history books on that . 
  reliquiae reliquiarum , uskoci and all that . 
  you missed a few llll 's there . 
  or import wharmpess from ny, 
  obviously , all slavs thought germans were mute . 
  and the smell . 
  god , the smell ... 
  oh , i 'm not disputing that , i 'm just pointing out the amusing fact that one of the biggest european projects is not being built on european soil . 
  well , i for one have clam chowder and cajun cuisine on my to-try list . 
  '' ... chilean desert ... '' '' ... european ... '' something does not feel right here . 
  originally it was a festival/competition where each country sent their best song chosen by popular vote . 
  then some outsiders started sending crazies for shock and comedy value , and other countries followed suit . 
  i usually go with , `` i could care less , but then you would n't be reading this sentence . '', 
  huh , they sound similar to our [ vje\u0161tice ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sggmwh2dxho ), 
  just one from croatia ? 
  c'mon , you should have at least added [ `` da te mogu pismom zvati '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xddv48_rcs4 ) also , ca n't have croatian folk without some tamburica songs : - [ miroslav \u0160koro - mata ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd4cwmitgpk ) - [ miroslav \u0160koro - juli\u0161ka ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trmsk74du88 ) - [ zlatni dukati - ne dirajte mi ravnicu ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp4dkyvbcfm ) and to show the scots that they 're not the only ones with instruments to close the party with : [ diple i ro\u017eenice from istria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cirpsbbfj-w ), 
  we also have a common slavic `` u zdravlje '' , although it 's used much more rarely than '' \u017divjeli ! '', 
  i tried the passion fruit ( maracuya ) flavor the last time i visited portugal , i 'm really disappointed it 's not available here, 
  if i found it in spar and lidl over here , i do n't see why it would n't be available in a bigger eu country . 
  if you think that 's interesting , the [ original ad ] ( https://youtu.be/ozzwri7jxsg ) will blow your mind , 
  yep , the name has that wharmpess beer vibe , 
   if some people burned my car and my shop and the state would do nothing to stop them , i would be afraid . 
  afraid ? 
  i would be bloody furious !, 
  i wanted to say milan bandi\u0107 , but he 's more of a sleazebag than a scumbag . 
  dunno , maybe [ `` moja domovina '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3cbgiazvxw&amp;t=38 ) edit : if we 're going by popularity on football matches , then [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbmy_osdjye ) is also a strong contender . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqx6qmlnamm ), 
  ah , in that case it would be something along the lines of `` when did you come down from a hill ? '', 
  i must say i have n't noticed a lot of vegetarians in my area , and i do n't think i know any vegans . 
  as far as i could see in the restaurants , there are not many vegetarian options available , but they * are * there . 
  if you 're a vegan , though ... well , good luck . 
  aside from that , all the veg ( etari ) ans i know prepare their own food , and the availability of fresh produce is definitely not a problem . 
  - waiter - natsugi wara ( `` cheats on drinks '' ) - thief - neko makosako ( `` somebody took the coat '' ), 
  ah , something like our stojko tvrdi\u0107 , then ? 
  in the same vein , we also have desanka \u0160aki\u0107 ( basically rosie palm ) . 
  the difference between '' \u010d '' and '' \u0107 '' . 
  in some regions , the difference can be clearly heard ( looking at you , istria ) , but in the standard spoken language it 's practically non-existent . 
  and no-one can spell '' \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i '' correctly anyway . 
  funny , i heard both `` u vra\u017eju mater '' and `` u bo\u017eju mater '' over here ... 
  if i remember correctly , it 's not even that different from the serbian curse ? 
  [ kako je po\u010deo rat na mom otoku ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvaw7mw-xbw ) - '' \u0160ta ka\u017ee ? 
   henryk sienkiewicz ooh , i remember reading his `` in desert and wilderness '' when i was younger . 
  modern era : - luka modri\u0107 - zvonimir boban - robert prosine\u010dki all time : - branko zebec - bernard vukas, 
  the one you find in a coca-cola bottle with a fanta cap . 
  in my country `` kroner '' is a slang word for a chronic alcoholic , so your comment made me chuckle , 
  nice . 
  i just took a look at prices in our shops ( well , one shop  ) , and you can find units in the range from 300 $ to 600 $ . 
  edit : and an installation price ranges from 150-200 $ . 
  in our house it 's rare to have the ac on the whole day , we usually turn it on to reduce the temperature and to dehumidify the air for an hour or two . 
  once the sun goes down , the temperature drops as well , so we open the doors and windows to let some fresh air inside the house while we chill ( heh ) outside . 
  during the night , if it 's particularly hot , we keep the doors and windows open and let the air circulate . 
  i think we did run the ac at night a few times , but that was when the air humidity was unbearably high . 
  we do n't like to have too big of a difference between indoors and outside temperature , since that can put a strain even on a young and healthy body . 
  let 's also not forget [ laibach ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glu9wa4hje0 ) . 
  i 've heard it described as `` two people arguing with a lot of \u0161\u010d\u017e\u0107\u0161\u010d\u0107s '' . 
  ... dude , you made me fight waves of nostalgia over here . 
  [ edo maajka - dragi moj vlado ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhk6xosj_zs ) - general social commentary , explicit lyrics edit : also , although not exactly from croatia - every other song from dubioza kolektiv is political . 
  they just got elected . 
  again . 
  so , you italians think of us as dogs , eh ? 
  ( for reference : `` ku\u0107a '' in croatian means simply `` house '' ), 
  any first and last name with the same root , e.g. 
  the mr nobody namesake for the official documents is `` nepoznat netko '' , literally unknown someone . 
  people here swear by linolada . 
  personally , both `` white '' and regular linolada taste better in pancakes than nutella . 
  less sweet , more chocolatey . 
  i 'm wondering how did they find out what an american tastes like ... 
  similarly , i ran across a standup show by billy connolly ( scottish actor ) , and while he did speak in english , his scottish accent was so thick that i understood only about half of what he said . 
  edit : [ an example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svrcln41f8w ), 
   `` not the sharpest toot in the shed '' in the same vein : i love all `` a few x short of a y '' type phrases . 
  `` there 's more than one way to skin a cat '' . 
  when you first hear it , you do a double take wondering how can the speaker mention something that cruel that casually . 
  after that , it gets amusing watching others hear it for the first time . 
  well , technically , only one has double last name ; the second one has a nickname , and the third one has two first names, 
  there was an episode of `` castle '' where they had to get a translator for a geordie ... 
   sith religious teachers strangely appropriate typo . 
  i 've heard of davey crockett and his trademark gun and hat . 
  also johnny appleseed ( thanks to old disney books translated to my language ) and paul bunyan . 
  others ... not really .
