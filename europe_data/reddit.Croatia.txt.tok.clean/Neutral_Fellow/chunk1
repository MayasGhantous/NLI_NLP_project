why do they not state how much money that is ? 
  stating it could even be a good thing , because it would bring a reality check to a lot of people against this once they realize that cops somewhere are payed just a couple dollars a day . 
  completely missed opportunity to use the danube waltz as a commercial . 
  nice . 
  northern germany is like a very large netherlands . 
   holy roman empire arguably the least evil empire in human history . 
  that is a very , very bad plan . 
  the west already wasted trillions in africa , nigeria alone got ** 400 billion dollars ** in aid . 
  it is hopeless and mindless to send money there . 
  my wheellock pistol is made in uk . 
  it is a very good pistol . 
  brits make good muzzle loaders . 
  what ? 
   there is no dancing in couples in serbia yes there is . 
   people in clubs are just standing and talking you 've been in rubbish clubs then . 
  eh , she seems nice . 
  she has a continuous asmr voice . 
  haha , i do n't think serbs would like the type of americans looking to leave the us because of trump . 
  magnificent man . 
   that 's actually wrong huh , i will look into this . 
   again i do n't care about the ethnic aspect of this , because as you said many of the spahis also had mixed or convert ancestry good , that is the reason i responded in such a manner , as many land owners who were a part of that system were local converts of whatever area ottomans conquered . 
   the spahis were always more numerous than janissaries . 
  false . 
  the sipahis were upper class , land owning men who made out the heavy cavalry of the ottomans , equivalent of the western gentry , they rarely exceeded few to several thousand men . 
  there were far more akinjis , ghazis and other troops . 
  also , ottomans stopped being primarily cavalry already by the 16th century . 
  somehow buses just did not really appear whenever i was anywhere in the city ( . _ . ), 
  replace `` developers '' with `` diversity '' and this is left wing europe right now ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmu0tzlwhbe, 
  i went to ljubljana for new years , just 2 hour ride from zg , i had a great time . 
  you should install trams in that city though , never walked so much in my life . 
  the bulgariaball seems like it is vomiting the jogurt . 
  yeah , like 10 wolves against a t-rex . 
   the real fighting forces were sipahi no , they were a part of the fighting force , with other segments being other parts , the jannisaries were a standing army of thousands , topping at 54 222 at one point , far more than there were sipahis . 
  amazing just how revisionist you are just so ethnic turks end up being the `` real fighers '' in the army even though large amounts of sipahis were also balkan converts . 
   why would ethnicity matter ? 
  ` oh , my sweet summer child ' - old nan said quietly, 
  technically , the croats did invite them to stay so ... 
   yes they can choose where they want to go , it 's their fundamental human right . 
  um , no , it 's not . 
  free movement through political borders is not a human right under international law . 
  i did not mean agenda in the sense that it was propaganda , i meant agenda in the sense of purposeful showcase . 
  english is not my native language so i guess it slipped that way . 
  pretty much haha . 
  even with a specific agenda , they still fail at it , meaning that the actual case is possibly/probably worse than they desire to paint it as . 
  for a country that size and such political ambition , 11 billion is nothing . 
  they actually got very near conquering constantinople and bosporus but britain and france prevented it from happening . 
  russia would go south to the black sea for a warm sea port , not west . 
  i meant that merely in the sense that russia will most probably remain politically aggressive . 
   and i quote yes you do . 
   quick question i have nothing in mind because i am not a prophet . 
   so you agree you posted this to justify russia 's foreign policy ? 
  re-read the statement . 
   do you know how many times these or similar videos were posted here to justify russia 's policy of aggression and annexation ? 
  these videos do nothing of the sort . 
   why do you think there are no similar videos posted for other countries ? 
  because other european countries are n't behaving as russia is , therefore it is unnecessary . 
  about damn time that island reunifies . 
  alrighty . 
  this is the first post about a countries history that i posted on reddit . 
  the only reason it was russia is because i stumbled upon those videos and found that they could be interesting to this subreddit . 
  the videos are not made by a russian creator and the channel itself is not focused on russian history , it merely covered it among other topics . 
  i myself fail to see propaganda value or bias in the videos towards russia as a country or the current russian government . 
  fascinating stuff . 
  a lot of such artifacts are being found and who knows how many are yet to be discovered . 
  interestingly ( or rather , strangely ) , on wikipedia , most oldest buildings listed are in europe , that is , until 2600 bc ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_oldest_buildings_in_the_world, 
  beautiful country . 
   a weird mix between vikings and celts/irish . 
  not really weird , vikings settled plenty of land in ireland and formed joined kingdoms with the irish , including dublin itself ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_dublin, 
   towns carry slavic names such as `` novigrad '' ( similar to famous kievan-rus city novgorod ) lol , not like there are actual cities with that exact name , croatia has four of them ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novigrad, 
  [ or this one ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_g%c3%bcns ), 
  i agree with your other points but ;  ottoman empire was technologically equal and even better than austrian military i disagree , even though they were ahead of europe in a number of regards for quite a while , the ottomans did not manage to field armies that could go toe to toe with western armies on equal grounds , it always required a numerical superiority , and it nearly always had it . 
  the only aspect where the ottomans were superior for a few decades was the navy . 
  there are , just not many , for instance the rurik dynasty of russia got them beat by 100ish years . 
   they killed more people than the nazis ( proportionally even in total numbers they get quite close . 
   slavs europeans besieging europeans , what is this sorcery of geopolitics ? 
   subutai should really be recognised as one of the greatest commanders in history he is recognized as such . 
  the issue is that mongol conquests were done by quite a number of generals that are forced share the glory . 
   destroying the polish and hungarian armies in a few days subotai was not at legnica , he had nothing to do with that battle apart from ordering third of the army to venture north . 
  subotai was only at mohi , which was quite a costly battle for them , contrary to popular belief , batu-khan himself was nearly overwhelmed in the center . 
  so that is where [ the gifs ] ( http://i.imgur.com/80coajz.gif ) are from . 
  georgia and armenia should unite into one country . 
  ... and call it , georgio armani . 
   is that italy with the highest homicide rate in the 1400s ? 
  most likely their insane love for duels . 
  italy had mass sword dueling for centuries , even among commoners . 
  the amount of sword masters italy produced is staggering , they did not even stop with the mass dueling until the very late 19th century ; `` paolo fambri , who was famous as a risorgimento hero , hydraulic engineer , practical philosopher , and theoretical mathematician , to say nothing of avid duelist , affirmed that ** some three thousand duels ** had occurred in the ** first seven years ** of the country 's existence . '', 
  `` in his best run of material , gelli analyzed ** 3,513 duels that occurred between 1879 and 1894 . 
  ** as revealed in gelli s statutiche del duello , most of these duels took place in the 1880s , which ** averaged 269 reported duels a year . 
  ** '' men of steel : dueling , honor , and politic in liberal italy by steven hughes ;, 
  til modern day brazil has nearly twice the intentional homicide rate as late medieval england . 
  ... and that most of the third world right now has a higher murder rate than england just before the medieval period ended . 
  alright . 
  croatian separate language confirmed . 
  but this is technically a post about the protest in budapest . 
  on this blessed day . 
  mostly flooding . 
  north dakota is at heavy risk of its red river messing up the entire urban area adjacent to it because rainfall along with temperature is increasing year after year ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_red_river_flood https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_red_river_flood here is how that looks like ; http://www.sharedgeo.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/sorlie_bridge_1997-640x428.jpg http://i.imgur.com/u1htgwg.jpg http://txktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pecanpoint.jpg http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20110414/incredible_red_river_flood_10.jpg http://cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20110414/incredible_red_river_flood_03.jpg,
