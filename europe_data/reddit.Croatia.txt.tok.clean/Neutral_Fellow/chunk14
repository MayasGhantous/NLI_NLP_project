  apart from one song , i do not know another example of him using that slogan . 
   hes a fascist , so is his band . 
  more like right wing nationalist . 
   funny enough , it 's bosnia that was the original separatist entity . 
   so i 'm sorry , but if you want to treat us as separatists , then bosnia should get the same treatment . 
  you can argue what you wrote , but all of it goes down the drain the moment bosnia became internationally recognized as an independent country . 
  croatia would have to side with the bosniaks though , that would skew the situation in f bosnia 's favor . 
   he uses the slogan `` za dom - spremni '' in his music not in the song i posted . 
  not really , since croatia is a signature of the dayton , the bosniaks will have croatia at their side while serbia will not be able to react in any significant manner . 
  will never happen . 
  if they try to secede , war . 
  thompson sports ustashi memorabilia ? 
   his `` fans '' that still does not make the song fascist . 
  the nazi 's adored wagner , that does not make wagner nazi music . 
  lol , how is that fascist ? 
  what is the difference between that song and the serb songs already posted ? 
  you can not be this butthurt .

  congrats on remaining a country for this long . 
  good luck with the separatists .

  the unemployment rates even among 2nd generation migrants are quite high , let alone the other usual suspects . 
  nothing surprising about this . 
  far oveer , the misty mountains cooold ... 
  not a fan of her , but this is pathetic . 
  time to string up the crossbows and paint the pavises . 
  g o t h i c, 
  oh go fuck yourself un . 
  go engage in some sinister charity funding scandal or something . 
   it would probably look different if we used ppp data . 
  as far as i know rents in nyc are n't exactly cheap . 
  recently there was some post on reddit about values within gdp , and some dude calculated that you could buy an entire neighborhood of houses in serbia for the price of an apartment in san francisco . 
  what is really crazy is that you could put the whole of africa in some of those states ; germany 3.494 trillion  2.263 trillion africa and have plenty leftovers . 
   but why vienna ? 
  what is the language we are writing in now ? 
   and btw : http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ragusa_ ( enciclopedia-italiana ) / what ? 
   istanbul was called constantinople by everyone ( also the turkish ) until after ww1 . 
  not now though . 
   new york was called new amsterdam by everyone until it was buy by the british . 
  yep . 
   i really do n't see the problem with us calling it ragusa and you dubrovnik . 
  because that is a silly practice to do when writing online in english . 
  i do not write be\u010d when talking about vienna either . 
  i call vienna be\u010d when i am writing or speaking croatian . 
  when i speak or write english i call it vienna . 
  it is not rocket science . 
   that 's not the point . 
  it is . 
   a lot of cities around the world have two or even more names . 
  dubrovnik does n't . 
   for example slovenian for venezia is benetke . 
  not my problem . 
   sorry , i was n't trying to claim that it should be italian i was just saying it has multiple names and is perfectly normal . 
  we call istanbul istanbul because it is turkish now . 
  nobody calls new york new amsterdam anymore for the same reason . 
  it is dubrovnik . 
  which country does the city now belong to ? 
  most of historiography , to my knowledge , now considers them a separate slavic tribe . 
  since it 's not constantinople , it ai n't ragusa either . 
  beautiful . 
  as is tradition . 
  not as bad as it looks , they were merely drunk supporters after the party won the election , those are n't actual politicians . 
  good job . 
   did n't you benefit from the compromise of 1868 ? 
  compared to 1867 , yes , but compared to the pre-revolution period , no . 
   croatia was essentially given full autonomy within hungary . 
  it was not full autonomy , not even close , and we also lost territory and had dalmatia separated from the country again . 
   bullshit not really . 
  it is only bullshit if one is talking about it in terms of some imagined global cataclysm , but certain areas having a too high population density is indeed a reality and a problem . 
   people were screaming at the same thing with china and india 20 years ago ... and they were right . 
  the countries are much better off if they have a smaller but stable population growth . 
  there is a reason the chinese government was so strict and totalitarian with their child policy , regardless of how widely and utterly unpopular it was/is . 
  also , if you did not notice , bangladesh has a population density ** multiple times ** that of china ( over ** 10 times ** ) or india ( over ** 3 times ** ) . 
  overpopulation is indeed a massive issue , it is just not some apocalyptic issue a lot of people scream about , but that does not nullify it as a reality . 
  lol , again with replying to multiple comments with the same comment ? 
  here is the reply then ;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem lol that is not an ad hominem haha  but its not surprising that you get so agitated and defensive nope , that is all you . 
   despite all facts and rationale none seen from you . 
   whith croatia having a long history of no achievements whatsoever oh my god , how pathetic one has to be ...

  i just googled bangladesh a bit . 
  population ; 2011 census 149,772,364 2015 estimate 168,957,745 density 1,319 / km2 jesus christ , they are growing at a rate of one croatia per year . 
  not really , first we went through the post revolution period completely united as jelacic finally had control over both dalmatia and croatia , then came the bach apsolutism when everything went sideways and then control over croatia was again split between two great powers . 
  in case of not having austria as a factor , hungary would have no other choice but to leave croatia alone or with great autonomy . 
  croatia at the time had a military manpower of 40-60 000 soldiers , hungary alone would not go to war with that for land that is not ethnically hungarian . 
   we could stop being a kingdom and become just a bunch of counties in hungarian republic . 
  could not happen in the a-u , with two powers at the top , how the hell could it happen then with merely hungary on top ? 
  true , but i do n't see how it could have been worse . 
   magyarization was also one of the main reasons why croatia sided with the crown in 1848 . 
  alright . 
   so the argument '' at the time this was the right thing to do '' is completely justified . 
  well , in retrospect , it was the wrong choice . 
   how could have we sided with the hungarians when there was an anti-hungarian sentiment in croatia ? 
  actually , hungarization and hostility between croats and hungarians is largely a result of this agreement , meaning post 1867 , in 1848 , the situation was more murky and even sided in the outlook towards austria and hungary . 
  of course hostilities were present before that , but the [ unionist party ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ma%c4%91aroni ) was still quite present at the time regardless . 
  already done in canada by that right wing blonde girl .
