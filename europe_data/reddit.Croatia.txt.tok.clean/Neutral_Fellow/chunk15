  here , [ found it . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggpzsefyvwm ) also , that tucker guy really blasted just how silly this issue is becoming ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctbcizui1aw&amp;feature=youtu.be, 
  recently , he became quite a contended personality here as well . 
  the current dogma about his actions wobbles from `` well , he meant well . '', 
  to `` it seemed a good idea at the time . '' . 
  imo , we should have sided with the hungarians , watch austria destroy itself in the revolution and then hope to god almighty that the russians decide that we are n't worth the trouble . 
  [ without grudges you say ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixfdh6ety1q&amp;t=0m46s ), 
  aka ; when the habsburgs betrayed croatia and sold us out . 
  we should have sided with the hungarians in 1848 . 
  huh . 
   greenland to newfoundland that is still 1000 + kilometers of ocean between those two . 
   why are n't you happy to just say they were good and great for their specific use see ? 
  it 's not that , i just wanted to point out the ocean faring factor and worded it poorly . 
  haha , i love how they left out the balkans , and thus , the most obvious candidates . 
  it died of cancer . 
  yeah , but none of those you mentioned ever made a cross oceanic voyage , so you can throw all that overboard . 
  also , the river travel thing was very important at the time . 
  also , speed . 
  why are you questioning yourself ? 
  that one was tied to the above comment about the blueberries , not the an-com . 
  i find it interesting how you are prodding for flaws in a silly meme postage . 
  [ so is food . 
   do you just keep these handy in case you need to use them ? 
  no , it is like a 2 second google image search . 
   also antifa \u2260 an-com bruh . 
  a lot of them are an-com . 
  [ are ya fan brah ? 
  [ is it ? 
  lol , i do n't like that guy either , but that is such a pathetic hit peace . 
  having soldiers patrolling my streets is inconceivable to me , and i grew up in the balkans after the war . 
   paris has always been a complicated city to love . 
  foreigners just got the wrong image about it . 
  not really . 
  paris was quite close to the stereotype until the 1970s and onwards , then masses of migrants started coming in and the french lacked the balls to consider state enforced cultural assimilation programs . 
  similar as detroit , put a ton of low skills/educated people in concrete blocks , allow poverty to engage in full swing , then gasp and wonder why things are going to shit . 
  yep , that is a pictish looking male . 
  [ not once . 
  i mean , technically , [ at least the boat part is correct ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oeselians ), 
  nevah, 
  the italians got you beat ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:caproni_stipa.jpg, 
   westminster does n't really have any say in the matter . 
  we said the same thing to the parliament in belgrade back in 91 . 
  [ trialism or gtfo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trialism_in_austria-hungary ), 
  nice stuff . 
  holy hell , hitler put goring , a bavarian , as minister-president of prussia ? 
  is there another charles the great ? 
  how so ? 
  a single letter published by some guy in the 16th century about one of the voyages is in question , but everything else is defined historiography to my knowledge . 
  [ are they overly welcoming to tourist by any chance ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkrikeg7tpg ), 
  yes , this is a reproduction of a warship , or longship ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/draken_harald_h%c3%a5rfagre [ frontal view .

  this is just a small viking boat , not a longship . 
  longships were bigger , sometimes a lot bigger ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:viking_longship.png https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/file:sebbe_als_2.jpg, 
  it boggles the mind how much happened that was not written down , lost forever to us . 
  how many societies , conquerors and civilizations rose and fell in europe , africa and asia , outside the bubbles of literate civilizations , that we will never know of . 
  not to mention that non-mediterranean europeans basically built everything out of wood until fairly recently , of which nothing remains . 
  all we ever get is vague remains of large ancient european towns/cities of which we will never even know the name of . 
  lol , why are you replying to multiple comments with the same reply ? 
   you sad sad little man https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ad_hominem  and when faced with them i was faced with nothing but pathetic sidelinings and personal opinions , not facts . 
   attacking others first you are the one attacking . 
   and then crying nope , still you . 
   well it is certainly more far right than left that is not an argument for it being far right lol . 
  no , it will be france again , vs germany , with charles the great . 
  you would love botafogo then , the portuguese once built a massive ship with 366 cannons ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/botafogo_ ( galleon ), 
   he 's more relevant today than cro-cop is but he 's not a bigger name overall . 
  is n't mirko a national hero in your country ? 
  mirko is a legend , but stipe is currently the champ . 
  instead of columbus day , this is the dude americans should have a day after , far less controversy . 
  the man just sailed around and explored , no genocide , no colonization or warfare , just sailing his ship and mapping the unknown . 
  cro cop is a legend but stipe has 18:2 record and a world champion belt at the moment so ... 
  the current ufc heavyweight champion of the world is a croat and you put cro cop as the kick off argument ? 
   i honestly ca n't help but feel more than a little bit bitter with how some people in modern croatia dare to try to claim tesla as one of their own . 
  says a man with a `` hur dur bosnia is serb land '' username . 
  only the islands and some coastal ports though . 
  inland dalmatia only came under venetian control in the 17th and 18th century . 
  [ 2 % would be low hanging fruit ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0jkfhrg.png ), 
   the one you answered to . 
  but reading isnt your strong suit . 
  no , you just failed to realize i corrected someone and nobody refuted that correction . 
   they were civilization builders too , but to negate the fact that they were brutal conquerors is silly . 
  i was not negating that at all . 
   thats just so stupid i wont even bother . 
  go buy a history book , one without `` fiction '' added . 
  holy shit . 
  alrighty buddy . 
   and now youve exposed yourself hahaha no . 
   not just as ignorant wannabe taking his knowledge from feels and fiction , as you already did before , but also as outright delusional . 
  there it is . 
  the inevitable ad hominem 's proving you are talking out of your ass . 
  alrighty . 
   the only thing pretentious here is your bs . 
  sure thing buddy . 
   source ? 
  make your pick you have to cite sources , not just google which books speak positively about your topic on amazon . 
   nominally at best . 
  and when britain was given up , no longer at all . 
  ridiculous statement . 
  imperial authority over gaul at that point was indeed a reality , it was not completely removed until the 450s .
