   no , berbers do n't want to annex europe and burn everything yeah , its not like numerous muslim leaders are literally quoted as saying that their ultimate goal is exactly that ... 
  without the eu we would have the economic prospect of a stale cabbage . 
  the woman behind him brought a blunderbus , seems like she is the smarter of the duo . 
  edit ; it would seem he also has a gun, 
  geert does not seem that bad at all for a dude his age . 
  at least his hair is magnificently buoyant . 
  yes , and ? 
  you do realize that other instances being raids means absolutely nothing to the argument of this particular invasion being a raid ? 
  also , was it not again conquest you speak of ? 
  did what ? 
  that is because western politicians are a bunch of spineless worms that like to tap each other on the shoulder about how altruistic they are . 
   which some historians are starting to think was n't really a battle but just a raiding/looting party . 
  only sad revisionists . 
  raiding parties do not purposefully capture land and cities and do not number in the tens of thousands . 
  it was heavy infantry in a shield wall supported by heavy cavalry and yes , the franks obliterated the umayyad army . 
  for those desiring explanation for the visigoth collapse , bazbattles did a video on the battle of guadalete which pretty much explains it ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8lgn6z62nm,

  `` the budget will balance itself '', 
  you wish to develop a mighty killer drone program ? 
   i doubt russia would invade just to put him in his place invading belarus would basically require total war . 
  belarus has nearly 300 000 soldiers and can double/triple that in case of mobilization . 
  nice one . 
  should have uploaded it to youtube for easier access though . 
  actually , i advise people to look into the values more closely . 
  there is not that much of a difference , only 20-25 % between the poorest and richest provinces ( excluding italy ) . 
  that is a much , much smaller difference than it is today between countries . 
  no , that would be climate change . 
  a good portion of sahara used to be a habitable land as well . 
   poor as fuck there is not that much of a difference between the provinces if you look closely . 
  it is a mere 25-30ish % difference between the poorest regions and egypt . 
  you started it ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cimbrian_war, 
  i believe the original was deleted . 
  well , it is true that there are still remnants of the far right around , but they are a miniscule number of random unemployed youth that do not really do anything beyond grafiti and nuisance . 
  oh , those are just scribbles on walls . 
  when you say that fascism is alive and well in a country it sounds as if it is within the political structure . 
  [ balada je jaca stvar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_7mywssr8 ), 
   also , fascism is alive and well . 
  lol what ? 
  [ when i followed your link ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3sjb2tcojy ), 
  our people managed to convince the entire human species that not only is tying a rope around your neck a reasonable idea , but an unavoidable fashion item .

   alternative facts one could say those facts are , alt right . 
  according to our facts this video is the best so far . 
  the reaction to it is yuge . 
  we invented the tie about 200 years before the napoleonic wars . 
   numbers are misleading .

  croatian and serbian separate languages confirmed .

   me\u0111uno\u017eno guravo that has literally 0 google results . 
  the catholic church in croatia is simply more influential than in most other countries . 
  unlike the stereotypical image of dummy priests , ours is stacked with quite capable/educated men who are very good at societal subversion . 
  two decades of slow and patient nudging of the society towards religion was quite successful . 
  in croatia it went the ** opposite ** way . 
  in the 80s only 20 % of croatia 's youth believed in god , now it is 78,7 % ; http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/u-boga-80-ih-vjerovala-petina-mladih-sad-gotovo-svi-1142521,

  oh my dear franz , [ what could have been if you just did not get shot ... ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/trialisticki_zemljevid_bec_1905_henrik_hanau.jpg ), 
  i always wondered how did vikings deal with this . 
  heck , they even went to africa . 
  summary translation ; the croatian state bureau of statistics said on monday that industrial production , according to calendar adjusted data , rose by 4.0 percent in december 2016 alone ( compared to the previous month ) , while compared to december 2015 it increased by 14.9 percent . 
  because a lot of people are against abortion even in cases such as these , because they are retarded . 
  the girl , even though she is a victim , is an utter moron and will now live with a physical reminder of her rape for the rest of her life . 
  not to mention what will all this do to the child once it grows up and learns where it `` came from '' .

  yeah , i guess you are right . 
  they cooperated out of necessity , not because of good relations . 
   so maybe change could have into should have . 
  perhaps . 
  though , with enough red scare propaganda , anything could be done imo . 
  that is because they relied on the us and they tried it globally . 
  i am talking about a focus on europe alone . 
  the coal steel pact could have been made in the 1920s if they tried properly . 
  the eu should have been formed after that war , not after ww2 . 
  you are forgetting russia . 
  you should not have polled favorite mods . 
  now the lowest rated ones will feel bad . 
  finally . 
   hatred for clergy and religion definetly was a factor . 
  true , but in this case it was sporadic and uncontrolled violence and reprisals . 
   and i do n't understand your insistence on ethnicity . 
  because you can choose/change ideology and religion , you can not choose an ethnicity or race . 
  this makes the very nature of violent action against the latter quite different .
