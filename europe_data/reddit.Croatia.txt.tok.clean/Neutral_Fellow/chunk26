   you deny the prior disturbance in the region as the main factor ? 
  no , i am merely denying the background of the events as an excuse . 
   well , historians who does n't recognize it at genocide in the majority . 
  that could be the case , i am not sure . 
  i will look into it . 
   so weird . 
  i feel like i am missing a joke from reddit or something . 
  probably a text structure glitch they fail to fix . 
   you can argue for ( as secher argued ) religious and ideological factor in vend\u00e9e too ? 
  not really religious , ideological yes , but not ethnic . 
   there is nothing in there about numbers . 
  oh , alright . 
   you did n't though . 
  what about the background ? 
  what about sasun ? 
  what about historians who does n't accept this stance ? 
  the background involved the mentioned groups as an issue solely based on their religion + ethnicity . 
   what about historians who does n't accept this stance ? 
  what about those that do ? 
   i jus realized something . 
  it does n't show the arm . 
  yes , this happens to me as well sometimes . 
  for instance \\ \\ ( o_o ) / /, 
   by this logic you can argue for the turkish side in the 1915 debate . 
  no , because of the religious + ethnic factor . 
  yes ? 
   not at all considering you continued it for the next sentence . 
  hah , i thought i removed that sentence before posting . 
   motive is important of course . 
  you did n't argue for it though . 
  i did , it was a clear religious + ethnic motive . 
   okay then alright , 
   like what ? 
  did you check what i recommend ? 
  vend\u00e9e massacre , check it . 
  that massacre was citizens slaughtering other citizens within a civil war , nothing more . 
   actually they are not , look at un 's definition . 
  i did and they are . 
   of course it has been purposefully done . 
  then this discussion is over and senseless . 
   there are lots of massacres that had been purposefully done the motive is equally important . 
   i beg to differ about the main motive as the ethnicity part . 
  there is where we disagree . 
   if all massacres were genocides we would have to consider every rebellion that has been crushed as genocide too . 
  not really , as they would have to pass certain criteria , which most massacres do not . 
   casualties are not deciding factor in genocide . 
  but they are a factor . 
  you can not deny that the massacres were purposefully done so and had ethnicity as the main motive . 
  well , i consider it a separate act of genocide . 
  calling it anything else would be misleading considering the amount of casualties . 
  that is at least my opinion . 
   not all armenians were and are orthodox . 
  the vast majority were and are . 
   happened way before wwii . 
  my bad , it was a typo . 
   1915 was n't also the sarikamish at all . 
  a good portion of historiography disagrees . 
  you do not consider tens of thousands of dead through purposeful ethnically targeted murders genocide ? 
  huh , that is interesting . 
  so the term changed and the connotations changed with it . 
   these are massacres . 
  one does not exclude the other . 
   those were during wwi . 
  my bad , i forgot the `` during '' in the sentence . 
  i meant to say during and after ww1 , as they lasted beyond 1918 . 
  ca n't wait to hear all the tourists try to pronounce franjo tu\u0111man . 
  that is one big croatia on that map . 
  nice . 
  technically , he just kidnap her . 
  she was ultimately seduced , not forced , from what i recall . 
  no , but she has a [ niece ] ( http://g8fip1kplyr33r3krz5b97d1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/h_51107257-714x476.jpg ) that a lot of people confuse for her daughter . 
   the armenians were christians ( i think ? 
  or was it orthodox ) orthodox christianity , and no , it was not merely an issue of relocation , after the disaster at the battle of sarikamish , the ottomans needed a scapegoat , and the armenians filled the bill perfectly . 
  what was done to them was purposeful mass scale punishment . 
  it was also not the first genocide ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hamidian_massacres https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adana_massacre also , ( during and ) after ww1 ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/greek_genocide https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assyrian_genocide, 
  a reminder from the times of mare nostrum . 
  whelp , justice had its chance .

  [ maybe they all went privateer ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgypuey-1jw ), 
  well , if you give it to hungary , without giving them slovakia as well , it would look like some weird growth on the map . 
  if the woman was white , nobody would even report on it as nobody would care . 
  but that would make slovakia look too elongated :p, 
  no , we are wasting tens of billions on unemployable refugees while the usa is importing only the useful ones . 
  that actually looks quite impressive borderwise .

   thus talking about something as european values is meaningless . 
  even if these values are accepted by majority of ( western ) europeans , they are still not the only ones and definitely not something permanent . 
  so everyone can have their values be dominant in their country/region but europeans and westerners ca n't ? 
  got it .

  meanwhile , saudi princes race their hot wheels around london like it is their playground . 
  at the coronation of elizabeth in 1953 , the emir of qatar had ** actual slaves ** brought there with him . 
  now , the slave trade was still active in the arab world at the time , but i would consider that to be at the top regardless .
