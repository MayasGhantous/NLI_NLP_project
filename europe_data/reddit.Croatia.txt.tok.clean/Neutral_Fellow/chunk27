  croatia is the claw . 
  yeah , just like islamic culture dominance happened when competition between muslim countries started when the caliphate broke up , or mediterranean dominance like when the roman empire broke up . 
  just as the early slavs originally did . 
   yes , it 's so unreasonable and petulant to think that the people preaching ethnic homogenity and classifying entire nationalities , religions , and ethnicities as ` undesirable ' or rapists are nazis . 
  none of that was done here . 
  none of that is done in the majority of cases to which you ascribe it . 
   really , the word has lost all meaning . 
  because of people like you . 
   you would think that on / r/europe of all places being anti-nazi would be an uncontroversial opinion . 
  the issue is you , and those like you , expanding the term nazi to anyone they disagree with . 
  you are n't being anti-nazi , you are just being a pissy little child .

  likely not farming , but some buildings that used to be inside it were definitely for storing food . 
  that is actually a myth . 
  sieges are a two way starving game , since the army besieging the fortification is also running out of supplies during the siege ( not to mention upkeep cost , weather and disease threat etc. ) . 
  i mean , of course starving out was one technique and it definitely happened , but storming castles was in no way a rare occurrence .

  nothing new , here some already [ refused to remain in croatia ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/izbaceni-iz-eu-ocajni-se-sirijci-vracaju-u-siriju-1144151 ) and either disappeared or announced return to the middle east . 
  that actually seems like quite an ingenious way of saving up materials and labor .

   there is no way hungarians and croats are pretty much the exact same people as this graph shows croats lost ugro-finnic tribe confirmed . 
  [ hungarian croatian ] , 
  it looks like the castle you build in [ age of empires 2 . 
   where are they supposed to find them ? 
  move their operations to croatia ? 
  ... please ? 
  it is even more of a shame that the conspiracy wave of the 1980s took on the templars and now swarms of people believe utter bullshit about templars , like they worshiped some goat god and were a part of the pre-illuminati . 
  those damn ass ass ins creed games even worsened it . 
  when you read the actual historical sources , they were pretty nice dudes for the time period . 
  they allowed commoners to ride side by side with them , allowed muslims to worship next to them , funded hospitals , schools etc. 
  the only sinister thing they did was banking , and even there they only ripped off the rich and wealthy . 
  this is slowly becoming hilarious . 
   rabtija what ? 
   yes , but they are n't part of bosnia . 
  ... but they were after the ottoman conquest until liberation . 
   they ruled much more technically not during the time of the banovina and kingdom they did n't . 
   i find it hilarious that you are trying to spread an ndh myth about how bosnia is croatian land . 
  what 's next , we are muslim croats ? 
   wtf is wrong with you ? 
  where did i ever even imply that bosnia was croatian land ? 
  what i stated is that croatia lost territory that is now part of bosnia , specifically western bosnia . 
  heck , bihac was not bosnian until 1592 . 
  there is a reason croatia pops up as a name for western bosnia as late as the [ 19th century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/1827_finley_map_of_turkey_in_europe%2c_greece_and_the_balkans_-_geographicus_-_turkeyeurope-finley-1827.jpg ), 
   when the person we are quoting said ` look at bosnia ' , i 'm sure he did n't mean slavonia and dalmatia . 
  lol what ? 
  do do not consider those parts of croatia ? 
   but the area around makarska rivijera and konavle was bosnian . 
  sometimes it was , other times it was not . 
  bosnia did not rule those areas until stjepan ii kotromanic . 
  also , i find it hilarious that you can claim bosnia ruled dalmatia based on makarska and konavle lol . 
   except it did n't . 
  [ except it did . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/3ikvx3y.gif )  on the map , they are part of croatia again what ? 
   anyway , dalmatia was part of the bosnian kingdom . 
  no , it was not . 
  dalmatia came under the rule of tvrtko for a very short period of time , only a few years . 
  no , he is saying ;  look at how big bosnia is , a lot of that territory used to be croatia you do realize that ottoman bosnia spread over the entirety of slavonia and dalmatia as well ? 
  what ? 
  nobody is claiming that the entirety of bih was part of croatia at the time . 
  re-read the initial comment . 
  the amount of castles we lost due to negligence and disrepair is horrid . 
  he means western bosnia , it was a part of croatia until the ottoman conquest . 
  not really , over 3/4th of croatia 's territory was lost . 
  [ this map ] ( http://www.matica.hr/media/uploads/hr/2015-2/hr2-15---_page_088_image_0001.jpg ) shows the former eastern border of croatia before the slow and grueling ottoman advance and compares it to modern borders . 
  in fact , what is now western bosnia was often referred to as croatia as late as [ the 19th century ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bc/1827_finley_map_of_turkey_in_europe%2c_greece_and_the_balkans_-_geographicus_-_turkeyeurope-finley-1827.jpg ) . 
  well , the ottomans carried no foreign diseases that wiped out most of the population ... 
  oh , my cute westerner . 
  my girlfriend has bosnian citizenship , was born in bosnia , yet she is not bosnian . 
  neither do hundreds of thousands of turks in germany declare themselves as german , nor millions of kurds in turkey as turks . 
  your purposeful naivety when it comes to this issue is reveling . 
  good .

  well , that would be murder . 
  those stairs look like a mighty location for a fancy sword fight . 
  well , sometimes you have to make some sacrifices . 
  magnificent . 
  yes , but this kind of economic regression could cause a different situation to envelop over the next year or two . 
  i am merely talking about possibilities , not probabilities . 
   so you just give up well of course you give up .
