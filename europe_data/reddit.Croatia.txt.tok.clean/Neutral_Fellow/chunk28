  any other alternative requires actual effort in societal engineering and admission that certain ethnic groups are becoming more problematic than the native french ethnic group , and that can not be . 
  remember a month ago , over 600 cars set on fire in paris and some people on this sub actually defended it as regular urban vandalism lol, 
  just keep picking them up , destroying the boats and transport them back to libya or tunisia . 
  the route would be closed within weeks . 
  perhaps political unrest happens in russia soon and slaps putin out of order . 
   yes and so did the botched turkey-operation of the allies . 
  gallipoli resulted in 200 000 allied casualties and lasted half a year , that is not nearly enough to compare to the italian front , or the possible south french front . 
   you realize i am talking about `` meaningful '' impact , not just any impact , right ? 
  yes , and two million troops is quite meaningful in ww1 . 
  well , the a-u was quite bad for croatia , as croatia was the only other active political entity within the empire , and thus a major inconvenience . 
  croatia was split and messed with right up until the war . 
  the only chance for a proper deal was trialism , but that idea died with ferdinand in sarajevo unfortunately . 
   like i said , they would have tied up an allied army , nothing more . 
  you do realize that is quite a major pillar of 20th century warfare right ? 
   look at how they did n't have any actual impact on the war is it were . 
  yeah , over 2 300 000 dead and wounded central powers soldiers rotting in the alps , no impact at all ... 
  perhaps . 
  however , you are missing the point that even if they remained neutral , that would mean one less front and 2 000 000 more a-u/german troops for the russians and the french to deal with . 
  well , considering the only two member states were austria and hungary , yes , it was not that bad to them at all , 
   i disagree . 
  the italian army was way to weak to have any meaningful impact on the war . 
  ridiculous statement , over ** 2 000 000 ** a-u/german soldiers were tied up in the italian front during the war . 
   at most , they would have forced the allies to deploy an army on the french-italian border . 
  yes , most probably 1.5-2 million soldiers , which is an enormous weight for the allies and would possibly help the germans on the western front considerably , regardless of whether italian troops even left the premises of their border . 
   okay , but i said wwi would look more like wwii , not that it would be identical . 
  yes , and i disagreed with that  in ww2 , the soviets were the dominant aggressor since late 1942 , in ww1 , the eastern front was much different , and without the a-u wasting troops against italy , it would be even worse for russia . 
   we 're talking about an alternate universe where italy sides with the central powers . 
  how that affects the entire chain of events that lead up to the bolshevik revolution is entirely unknowable . 
  i concede this point . 
   yes , and they nearly lost in wwii as well no , that is not the same thing . 
  almost lost and lost is not the same , in ww1 , germany won in the eastern front . 
   maybe russia reenters the war after the bolsheviks take power , if at all . 
  russia had a civil war that lasted for years after peace was signed , they were in no condition to fight . 
   if italy had sided with the central powers , wwi would probably have looked more similar to wwii . 
  but russia lost in the east even without italy . 
  also , france would then have a south-eastern front to fight as well . 
   do you think italy joining the war with germany and austria would have changed the outcome of the war ? 
  i believe so . 
  germany won in the east regardless , and with italy on their side , a-u and germany would have an even easier time ensuring victory in the east , and a peace treaty that could , in the end of things , influence a possible victory in the western front as well . 
  austria had no interest in annexing parts of croatia , so i chose ze austrians over the italians . 
   the same is true for train tracks . 
  yes , but tracks are two metal rods , this is a tunnel under vacuum . 
   that 's already a thing and it 's called metro . 
  lol no . 
   maybe not vaccum though , but still . 
  dear god , the difference of that vacuum as a factor is so enormous that it is comical to even mention the two in the same sentence . 
   ` tis a shame . 
  he should know better . 
  not really , the same issue remains . 
  in case of a rupture , the vacuum is breached and travel has to be halted . 
  the air blast hitting the pod will still cause major damage and likely destruction , regardless of the tight/loose fit . 
  airplanes do not require 100s of km of highly maintained and fragile tunnel under vacuum . 
  the hyperloop vacuum tunnels would be millions of times larger than the largest vacuum chamber ever built by humanity . 
   better that the system has to be halted than if someone was to be hurt . 
  yeah , about that , if a single rupture happens in the length of the travelling distance while the system is active , everyone in the tube dies ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnfesa01llk&amp;t=11m00s, 
  walls are expensive , quadcopters and smallarms are n't . 
  yes , you saved a lot of money and time . 
  all europe needs is 200-300 large quadcopters armed with rubber bullets . 
  problem . 
  solved . 
  great , ca n't wait to watch all the explosions on liveleak . 
  you do n't understand . 
  if someone/something pierces the tube , at any location along those 100s of kilometers , the system has to be halted until repair . 
  ... and that is only one of the numerous idea breaking issues that plague this project . 
  it is arguably the most idiotic thing that ever came out of the shadow of futurology . 
  how about , i do n't know , using the navy to blockade the damn sea ? 
  enforcing the rule of law is not rocket science ffs . 
  you are a corrupt person then . 
  damn . 
  [ another victory for france ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zas66wg.gif ), 
  i like how the sword is its mustache . 
  there is very little evidence of that actually happening . 
  [ heck yeah this design should have stuck . 
  ] ( http://monovisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/vintage-poland-during-interwar-period-1920s-15.jpg ) ( albeit more refined ofc ) what is the name of that train design popular in the usa during the interwar period ? 
  we should have never abandoned that style , as a species . 
  this is why you need a mandatory 10-15 years minimum without parole for government related corruption . 
  [ dear god ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iub-wjxuree ), 
  the joke would not work well if i used another word , 
  1 ) we trade romania for istanbul . 
  2 ) move all romanians to istanbul and move turks from istanbul to romania . 
  3 ) roman empire restored and ottoman romania restored . 
  hah , quite . 
  the french are my favorite monolingual tourists , they actually get perturbed that you do n't speak french when they need something . 
  perhaps you should focus more on your eastern parts than on the western parts : x, 
  i visited slovenia in 2015 . 
  impressive people . 
  their mindset is a unique blend of western/central europe and east/se europe . 
  ljubljana also surprised me , very nice city . 
  quite frustrating that they could easily understand what we were saying in croatian , but we could not understand a word they were saying . 
  uh , i looked it up and you are correct . 
  my bad . 
  wikipedia has an incorrect opening statement then ;  on 24 january ( o.s. ), 
  ( 5 february n.s. ), 
  ** 1862 ** , the principality of moldavia and the principality of wallachia formally united to create the romanian united principalities, 
  turtles also do . 
   we 're too mean/racist ya , the french are so racist that the entirety of africa wants to go live with them . 
  them that oil son ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_oil_production, 
  interesting how hate voting apparently became a regular thing now . 
  perhaps . 
  though the issue is that vegan food has far less calorical/nutritional value pound for pound , thus you would need to recalculate the amount of production increase it would require per person compared to meat .
