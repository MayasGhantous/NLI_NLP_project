  perhaps they could buy one east indian shipyard as well , for naming purposes . 
  alright . 
  i disagree . 
  this event formed romania as a political entity we know today , the fact that certain areas with romanian majority were still outside its borders is irrelevant . 
  that meme does not work with that video because it includes the context from the movie . 
  in the future , use this video instead , as it is shorter and only includes the shout ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3dbd2yyen0, 
  yes , because of the shroud of altruism hiding their sinister nature . 
  not a laughing matter . 
  we would be having parades in all major cities if that was the case here .

  nice find . 
  yes , a swede made the map , 
  we have the best swiss . 
  europe has a long history of ice skating . 
  arguably the oldest pictorial depiction of ice skating comes from the carta marina ( 1539 ) , [ which depicts men skating over the frozen gulf of finland .

  depleted halloumi ammunition . 
  so you think of the southern caucasus as a separate region ? 
  yeah , but the most widely accepted border is the ural-caspian-caucasus line . 
  inb4 cyprus becomes nuclear power in exchange for decades long supply of halloumi . 
  i just looked it up , and you are right . 
  so then armenia is in europe , even though it is south of the mountains ... weird . 
  armenia is south of the caucasus , that is middle east . 
  you drowned people by shooting rubber bullets at them ? 
   rubber bullets are dangerous and can kill people if they hit in wrong places that is why you shoot at the legs . 
  borders and countries exist for a reason , rules have to be enforced . 
  none of this would be necessary if shooting rubber bullets at illegal crossers was acceptable . 
  either cloning , people not dying anymore because of [ technology ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc1p-aeaep8 ) , or we make a giant biomass womb that incubates slavs and keeps pumping out youth .

  well , western istria was never croatian until 1945 . 
  stuff happens . 
  you think that is medieval border gore ? 
  [ check this out  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/medieval_livonia_1260.svg ), 
  similar thing here in croatia as well . 
  a good portion of the women are hella conservative . 
  women even led the anti-gay and anti-abortion campaigns . 
  that is horrible . 
  damn . 
   we lost our trading power because we had to adapt to eu laws we had no trading power to lose . 
   vast majority of young people tend to go to germany thus we have brain drain . 
  because our ruling class basically corrupt-raped croatia into an economic graveyard . 
   we are still not in schengen things take time , who knew . 
   yugoslavia 2.0 honestly , i would prefer being a right-less territory under direct rule of the eu than being ruled by the current political class of croatia ... and i am a f *** ing nationalist . 
  the eu is the best thing that happened to croatian politics since the end of the war . 
  because nearly every single participant in croatian politics is a scummy cumstain that deserves their shins bludgeoned inwards with a mallet . 
  a mentally handicapped substitute drama teacher ? 
  mr. [ `` the budget will balance itself '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9bqciqd51i ) that has the same amount of political credentials as trump and glorified castro ? 
  my , she is quite lucky to have such an ally . 
  ne bas cistak , ali ima jos it murius i drinius . 
   i never saw a dutch man with a dark wife . 
  why is that ? 
  because the opposite is far more taboo and far more noticeable to many ( and obviously you ) . 
  a similar stereotype lives in the us , where the thought is that white man + black women ir relationships are n't prevalent , even though they reach up to 40-45 % of the black-white relationships by a lot of recent estimates . 
  the tick is that nobody gives a damn about white dudes dating foreign women , the same is obviously not the case for white women . 
  heck , even when i was in sweden , i saw more swedish dudes with foreign women than the opposite . 
  i like how they completely ignore the fact that the rest of the human population in developing countries will still want to live a western living standard as soon as possible , increasing their trace on the world at the same rate their economies develop . 
  imagine if 7 billion people consumed as an american . 
   native women are n't pulling their womb weight holy hell that is a magnificent sentence . 
  um , just arrest them for treason . 
  it 's not rocket science . 
  meh , an iron age germanic town seems like [ quite the cozy place to live in ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lrwynnnsuug/uswttozsfxi/aaaaaaaabug/v11yht7srkm/s1600/fig.+3+-+reconstruction-lr.jpg ) compared to the urban centers .

  a human rights organization that is a front run by his sons and that employs a good number of his extended family . 
  look into what he did in the asian markets over the decades just for an example and rethink if him playing the altruist game is really sincere . 
  [ they 're already here ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkjt6tws-uy ), 
  but he acts like a billionaire sociopath ... 
  well , that is quite an impressive amount of wealth considering what they do as companies .

  no , he favors virtue signaling and feeling important at dinner tables . 
  he does not give a fuck about anyone . 
  yeah , putting millions of malaysian fates at jeopardy by shaking up their economy just to make a few bucks surely levels him because he likes refugees . 
  he is an evil reptile of a man who messed with the currencies of other countries to make his wealth . 
  from malaysia to russia and even messing up the bank of england , all he ever did was fuckery . 
  he was also a collaborator with the nazi 's when he was a kid and describes the period as the best time of his life . 
  the man is an evil caricature . 
  [ do n't forget when you marched into anatolia and `` liberated '' a lot of it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_iconium_ ( 1190 ) ) . 
  then , of course , the emperor drowned and all was abandoned . 
  nice . 
  why does it have two sinks though ? 
  time to go steal some worms . 
  i expect the greeks are already on this . 
  well that is nice . 
  that is one big bathroom . 
  lies . 
  they only want more wood for their longboats . 
  because other countries had a transition during peacetime and other countries had a transition from full communism to capitalism while yugoslavia was more of a half-half version , allowing the corrupt scum far more leeway to steal everything . 
  croatia had a transition during wartime and post-war time , everything was in chaos and the ruling political class simply switched into full corruption mode for a full decade , this then caused a ripple effect into other political parties so the entire political scene went to shit , even when the left wing was in power . 
  this continues to this day , with uneducated morons and leftovers from yugoslavia , on their best day achieving the productivity and usefulness of stale cardboard . 
  utter corruption , incompetence and negligence of the political and ruling class . 
  except in this situation there are actual issues that can not be worked around . 
  well , 876,000 barrels of oil per day ai n't no joke . 
  not to mention that competing pipeline that the azeri are pushing .
