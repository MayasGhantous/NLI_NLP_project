  not to mention the shiites do not give much of a damn about islam in europe . 
  soon ... 
  the muslim part is implied in the insults though . 
  words like `` poturica '' and `` balija '' are directly connected to negating the bosnian ethnicity . 
   people in zagreb spole hungarian erm , no , hungarian was only present to any noticeable degree in east slavonia . 
  in zagreb , you were more likely to hear german than hungarian back then . 
  that is , among the citizens themselves , the hungarian political establishment obviously spoke hungarian , but they were few in number . 
  not enough kids playing on [ destroyed tanks ] ( http://visit-sarajevo.com/upload/image/under_the_siege//01.png ) imo . 
  `` the budget will balance itself . '', 
  it is not irony , he is playing [ 4d chess ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgdhqr71i4c ) . 
  stumbled upon this , thought it was pretty neat . 
   you kind of brought that point up by suggesting everyone will start to work `` half-assed '' how ? 
  i am not talking about people slacking , but doing the minimal required , that is what half assed means . 
   what they actually ca n't do is pay someone less or more because of their gender . 
  they already ca n't do that . 
   my point is that any other variables , such as experience , skill , qualifications etc. 
  are and will remain factors influencing the amount an employer is willing to pay . 
  re-read into what they are proposing again . 
   and for some reason iceland wants an unexperienced trainee to be paid the same as a skilled , experienced professional . 
  no , but with employees with similar stature , which is most of everyone on every separate level in the hierarchy , you will have to level the collective pay between both genders ... 
   how would you even carry that box ? 
  [ like a mahyun ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sqbsgtv2jxk/t4cfgagsyoi/aaaaaaaaadm/dfl4eo7owms/s1600/arnold-toting-a-tree_o_gifsoup.com.gif ), 
   sanctioning bad performance the vast majority ( basically all ) of salaries are not a result of sanctions/punishments but employers simply paying you either the same as before or more if they wish so . 
  so that point is moot . 
   or negotiate contracts with respect to the current state of the economy ? 
  that would include all employees and both genders then with a blanket effect according to this law . 
  you end up with the same issue . 
   considering it weighs about 35 kilograms !, 
  that is not heavy at all , that is lighter than my kettlebell . 
  hold my beer ... 
  surreal . 
  inb4 first women doing their jobs half assed because they can not suffer underpayment and then inb4 men also joining them by doing their jobs half assed because everyone has to be payed the same so why bother with the extra work . 
  good job morons . 
  i mean , it is not as if it is obvious and apparent by simply observing society itself or anything ... 
  i mean , it is not as if you can sum up all of it in a 4 hour presentation instead of an entire course , or even worse , an entire study major . 
  nothing but useless degrees coupled with nothing but agenda and indoctrination . 
  woah , this is some shin bludgeoning worth of an offence . 
  reminds me of [ this .

  [ resistance is futile . 
   but why are you including history ? 
  because nearly all history classes are actually serious , present proper curriculum and deliver actual knowledge . 
   why is that more important than political science , anthropology , law , and economics ? 
  i worded myself poorly with the above comment , my fault . 
  by that `` most '' i meant the swap of social science classes , women studies , gender and race stuff listed etc. 
  none of which deserve more than a 15 minute ted talk each in terms of actual worth and weight within them . 
  i thought that they would be able to suffer what is forced upon them and submit to the changes . 
  oh well , orban is as orban does . 
  i thought they were just forcing the university to submit to state laws and oversight ? 
   yes . 
  this is a huge loss for hungary . 
  only if the stem or history related parts are affected . 
  most of the rest are just sets of useless powerpoint presentations . 
  [ here is the entire place . 
  yes , i know that . 
  the part i was wondering about is italian actually being an official language there . 
  to my knowledge , it is a recognized minority language , not equal to croatian legally . 
  or am i mistaken ? 
  istria is not a country . 
  also , source ? 
  nevah . 
  you should post the coordinates . 
  it took me a while to find it before i could post my pixel . 
  muster the fyrd !, 
  will someone please stream this time ffs ? 
   they  kill  people . 
  some members of their party do . 
  the party itself is still not a criminal organization . 
   take your justice and stack it up your ass , cause i do n't want it . 
  without those laws and the justice system the golden dawn would be far more powerful than they already are now . 
   how do you know they 're not a criminal organisation ? 
  because they are n't illegal under greek or eu law . 
  they are an active political party of a country . 
   you do n't know jack about golden dawn . 
  i never claimed i did . 
   that being a criminal organisation . 
  they are n't one . 
   i ca n't feel the slightest bit of sympathy for them . 
  really ? 
  two random nationalists being gunned own for being members of a political party ? 
   in an ideal world golden dawn would be illegal and those two would be in jail before they were dead anyway . 
  they could argue the same for leftist parties and also equalize the fault of violence with migrants not coming to greece . 
   yes , they literally kill random people just because their skin is dark . 
  do you have a source for these killings ? 
   what are you trying to justify ? 
  not stooping down to vandalism and violence ? 
  [ or even just straight up murder ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_neo_irakleio_golden_dawn_office_shooting ), 
   except they 're slaughtering immigrants in the streets are they ? 
  also , i meant that in the general sense , the enemies of the antifa across the west are usually way milder than the golden dawn but they act the same regardless . 
  no it is ; right wingers : `` hey , i believe this . '', 
  anarchists ; * violently assaults anyone who they deem nazi , most of which are n't anything close to it * liberals : `` both of you are fucking retarded . '', 
  [ i participated . 
  that is merely what is left of the foundation . 
  here is a [ 3d reconstruction ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usur6oedqfo ) of a section of it including one of the forts .

  to be fair , they did try a number of times but the tribes simply could not be conquered without a force far too large for rome to sustain there . 
  the difference is that roman provinces usually prospered under their rule ( after the bloody conquest ofc ) . 
  hell , gaul went from a damp tribal forest to having an estimated 80 % of the gdp per capita of egypt . 
  even the city of carthage achieved its largest population , growth and wealth under roman administration ( apart from the depopulated cursed section ofc ) .
