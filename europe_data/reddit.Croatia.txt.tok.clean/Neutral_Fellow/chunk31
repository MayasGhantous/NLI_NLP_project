  yes , and that costs basically nothing . 
  do you have any idea how cheap industrial electronic components are atm ? 
   they import a lot for their arms factories . 
  not the case . 
  alright , that is a valid opinion . 
   the rebel forces were winning until russia intervened with their airpower . 
  yet even with russia ** and the usa ** against them , isis was still not bashed out even though they had no air force whatsoever . 
   but airpower is such a massive force multiplier that you ca n't ignore it . 
  i am not ignoring it , i am merely denying it having utter supremacy . 
   what else would they succumb to ? 
  re-read your initial argument lol . 
   zero air to air casualties proved my point no it did not . 
   until air superiority is established . 
  yet the argument were russian ground to air systems , not the russian air force . 
   they also are n't the main tool for ground support . 
  fucking lol , the us does not have boots on the ground in syria , there is no land army to support . 
  the us bombings are mostly strategic bombings , not cas . 
  they are n't in the business of cas for rebel forces . 
   again , you do n't know what the hell you are talking about . 
  sure thing buddy . 
   a-10 is long past due for retirement and mentioning it as though it is the main tool to be used against the russians proves you have no business talking about the topic . 
  ridiculous statement . 
  the us refused to retire it multiple times , it is still the main cas vehicle in the us air force with nothing else even on the horizon to replace it . 
  lol ; a-10 combat losses in operation desert storm were ** all from ground to air systems ** ; february 2 -- an a-10a thunderbolt ii ( serial number : 80-0248 ) was shot down by an igla-1 ( sa-16 ) surface-to-air missile . 
  february 15 - an a-10a thunderbolt ii ( serial number : 78-0722 ) aaa ground fire 60 miles north west of kuwait city while attacking republican guard targets . 
  thought to have been engaged by sa-13 gopher sam . 
  february 15 -- an a-10a thunderbolt ii ( serial number : 79-0130 ) hit by ground fire approx 60 miles northwest of kuwait city while attacking republican guard targets . 
  thought to have been engaged by sa-13 gopher sam . 
  february 19 -- an oa-10a thunderbolt ii ( serial number : 76-0543 ) was shot down by an strela-1 ( sa-9 ) surface-to-air missile 62 nm north west of kuwait city . 
  february 22 -- an a-10a thunderbolt ii ( serial number : 79-0181 ) wheels up , hard stick landing after being hit by a sam . 
  february 27 -- an oa-10a thunderbolt ii ( serial number : 77-0197 ) crashed killing pilot lieutenant patrick olson ( posthumously promoted to captain ) after a reconnaissance mission over kuwait on 27 feb 1991 , call sign nail 51 . 
  aircraft had been hit by surface-to-air missile . 
  stop talking out of your ass . 
   this shows how much you know about military tactics you mean implying the very sole purpose the a-10 has ? 
   implying that is the first option in the first place . 
  close air support , google how that works . 
   russia plans many things but they are incredibly underfunded and oil/gas has plummeted which caused cuts to their plans . 
  i do not see them slowing down the modernization of their army at all . 
  remember , that nationalism is a product of the 18th and 19th century , and that the 20th century happenings tied to it are merely a result of nationalism stemming into the right wing spectrum . 
  the very notion of the nation state modern politics is built upon stems from nationalism in its primal form , it does not need to be right wing if a liberal iteration of it is tried . 
  the utter lack of nationalism in western europe is exactly the reason nobody is assimilating in european countries and so many problems within multiculturalism are put on the table . 
  just imagine in what horrid state india would be if not for pan-indian nationalism preventing it from splitting up into numerous smaller states in conflict with each other . 
  nationalism can be used for good if used as a reasonable political tool instead of ideology . 
  yes , sadly . 
  the same happened in the balkans , so many old structures destroyed and replaced with concrete blandness . 
  and what does air cover do without ground forces ? 
  you do realize what has happened in iraq and syria in the past years ? 
  for instance , isis took back palmyra without a single airplane in their force , all through ground force action despite russian and syrian air dominance . 
  not to mention that the big players also have loads of ground to air missile systems that limit ground support air action to a horrid degree . 
  russian tank doctrine includes complete anti-air cover for the tank forces , good luck even getting close to a russian tank with an a-10 . 
   also , how many new tanks actually exist ? 
  the numbers of the new tanks are not public knowledge , but russia allegedly already has hundreds of t-14 armata 's , which is an entire generation ahead of anything that the west has deployed or even in production and they are planning mass production in 2017 . 
  yes , they are a good/reasonable example ( at least judging from my limited knowledge of their activities ) . 
  easy . 
  you merely create a platform based on the obvious notion that the eu is ** in the national interest ** of each country within the eu . 
  there is no need for some irrational push towards federalism this early in the game , all the eu needs is a series of liberal parties that attire to the nationalist fervour and absorbs the right wing populist voters into their rank , in essence , stealing away the only platform right wing parties can function on , and eliminating them without a single spasm . 
  to the point , if merkel started waving the german flag around and praising germany , the afd would disappear within a single election cycle . 
  liberal nationalism . 
  it would annihilate the right wing populist movements and basically wipe out euroscepticism as we know it . 
  it would in essence make the hard right wing and hard lefties/greens disappear . 
  of course , this does involve a lot of flag waving and promotion of culture and ethnic identity , so i do understand that it is a hard sell to some of you here . 
  [ cologne new years eve , 2031 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtfw6ip4sw0 ), 
  it only has a small number submarine based missiles and does not have land based missile system at all . 
  that is not the case . 
  without ground strength , air supremacy means nothing . 
  that is far from the case . 
  russia has been modernizing its army for over a decade and a half , they are far from an obsolete rump . 
  they are actually ahead in tank development as they have the only fifth generation tank in production on earth . 
  do not be mislead by those budget readings , a million dollars spent in the russian army is not the same as a million dollars spent in the west . 
  we have to take russia seriously . 
  non-urban germany is always a pretty sight . 
  why are you speaking of 1917 , yet do not mention a far worse situation of the 1940s ? 
  no , russian soldiers are n't golems , but the russian military would absolutely be able to keep itself active even in the case of economic collapse of russia . 
  by destroying the russian economy , you would simply create a more angry russian soldier , however , angry at the west instead of a dissident angry at his own government . 
  well , you are wrong . 
  russia 's military power is quite enormous and the modernization it overtook over the past few years is quite terrifying . 
  russia has the only fifth generation tank on earth in production at the moment , it is no longer the same relic it was a decade ago . 
  yes , i understand what you are saying , but you are very mislead if you believe any of that would halt the russian military , it would not even faze them . 
   i shit you not 10x times more than russia one million spent in russia is not the same as one million spent in sweden or france . 
  russia does not buy military equipment , they produce nearly everything domestically . 
  that is not how that works . 
  apart from the ground to air missile systems russia has in droves , they would not be facing the western airforce in the manner you think they would . 
  russia 's military is built and maintained wholly within russia . 
  an army of that size would be able to maintain itself for at least 5-10 years even in the case of total economic collapse . 
  russia even has protocols for keeping the army active in case of nuclear total war , there is no way economic sanctions alone could stall their military machine . 
   given that the eu has a combined military budget of several times that of russia that is actually quite misleading . 
  apart from the fact that the eu does not have an active nuclear icbm arsenal while russia has 1700 + , you must understand that basically all of russia 's military equipment is produced domestically , they do not buy foreign equipment , heavily skewing the actual picture of military budgets . 
  one million dollars spent in the uk army is not the same as 1 mil spent in the russian army . 
  russia still has a massive army and an army that is being constantly modernized , for instance , they are the only ones on the planet with a fifth generation tank in production . 
   nationalists are a special kind of idiots . 
  hey now , no need for such generalizations . 
   the nukes are deterrents and not intended for tactical use up until that one point in time when that changes . 
  then you include all of it as german , not exclude everything as if none is german . 
  pakistan does not even have icbm 's . 
  they could wipe out some millions of nearby indians , if even that . 
  having nukes does not equal being able to deliver them to their targets . 
  russia has the largest icbm arsenal on the planet , meaning they can wipe out anyone , at any time , anywhere . 
  just die already . 
  second english civil war, 
  they have the largest active nuclear arsenal on earth .
