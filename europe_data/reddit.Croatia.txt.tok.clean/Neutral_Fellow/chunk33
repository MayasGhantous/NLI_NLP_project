  they did come to ireland , they just never conquered it . 
  lol no . 
  china is incredibly dependent on the west and even more so on the us controlled oil lines of the me . 
  over 80 % of its oil will be imported by 2025 and currently 48 % of that goes through hormuz . 
  the us could shut china down by merely plugging that small strait . 
   i 'm italian too but 186cm blonde with blue eyes a number of roman emperors were tall blondes . 
   the romans had to recruit barbarians into their ranks because their population simply could n't sustain their army . 
  that is far from the case , they were one of the most populous political entities on earth . 
  it is merely that the tribes kept migrating within roman borders and the most logical step seemed recruiting them into the military machine . 
  the persian empire ( and others ) did this for centuries and it worked pretty well ( while the empire lasted ofc ) . 
   their tax base also was n't large enough to sustain the empire , so they had to get slaves to do all the work it is the reverse , mass slavery is what destroyed the tax base and the roman peasant . 
  if they made slavery illegal and focused on making everyone citizens within the empire , they might have survived for quite some time . 
  no , because they would all leave there asap , back to where ever they came from . 
  kerkennah islands, 
  it technically has a checkerboard , although only 4 fields . 
  i bumped my car on the fence end while parking the other day . 
  anglo-saxons were n't vikings . 
  [ ** bavarian conservatism intensifies ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4odo9eh0iwu ), 
   they are dancing not walking . 
  i get that , i meant just walking ** into ** the water . 
   and yes , before that they drink wine or raki in good amounts . 
  that is good . 
  that seems a lot of fun . 
  would probably have to get pissed drunk to consider walking in there . 
  the water level is just tall enough for your balls to freeze . 
   fun fact : all these ancestors ' places of birth fit in a circle with 30km radius . 
  well , mine are two circles with a 30km radius , 
  here 's where i took the template from ; http://www.familyecho.com/ it only takes a few seconds to make up , printscreen and paste in an image editor . 
  turkey has nothing to do with the ferry service between europe and libya . 
   tourists that come to europe for the free money ? 
  i think he meant it in the sense that they were there just for the new years . 
   if we have to break the law to help people , let 's do it !, 
  go rob a bank then and send the cash to jordan . 
  would be helping 10-15 times more people . 
  what is your actual population ? 
  you just threw me into a rabbit hole i was not prepared for with that website . 
  not the ones that come here , though , we only ever see them in their best form ( since its summer ) . 
  can , can people ice skate on in ? 
  um , should n't the women be in full burka 's if they are within the caliphate ? 
  the parks local director reminded me so much of someone i wanted to punch the screen . 
  where the hell are the local nationalists ? 
  a couple masked buddies with crowbars and spikes could take out any truck that even comes close . 
  heck , when my friends and i dealt with our version of this story we just payed a couple gypsy kids to utterly demolish every glass surface of their vehicles with rocks . 
  vampire stakes are not made out of forest trees , but out of fruit tree branches . 
   they 're trying to preserve the public order germany has an effective police force and a functional judicial system that already does that . 
  sweden . 
  [ well , tell that to the 80s .

   the second image depicts an elementary school class from the netherlands oh , my bad , well , i just gathered those in a couple googleing seconds for banter purposes , did n't really check them . 
   i wonder whatever happened to the idea of secularism in modern europe . 
  no idea . 
  at least when they took us to church we could just stand around bored and look at the pretty chandeliers while making fun of the nuns , not so much leeway when you are face floor bowing in the name of something that directly translates as `` submission '' . 
   we have many mulatto czechs ( usually african father/white mother ) interestingly , here it is the reverse . 
  basically 90 + % of ir couples here are croat dudes with various women they picked up while working abroad . 
  because it 's the 80s . 
  [ but can they understand my program ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_q1flsmu7g ), 
  i have no idea about is other works/activities , just the kgb stuff , which is basically the only important thing about him . 
  except a good portion of what the dude predicted decades ago came to fruition . 
  an entire segment of societal discussion in us/canadian learning institutions is now rife with false facts and extreme left garbage . 
  there are actual campus halting conflicts about gender pronoun usages there lol , they are subverting societal discourse on the basis of 0.01 % of the population that does not use he/she . 
  this is completely different from the dulles plan , as it predicted nothing . 
  if you consider this interesting , look up videos featuring the kgb defector yuri bezmenov . 
   far-right/neo-nazis are political opponents ? 
  yes . 
   i guess isis are political opponents in syria and iraq too . 
  yes . 
  alright altright alright , this is the dumbest thing i have heard in months . 
  it baffles me that elected officials can play with the legality of persons within a country merely to spite their political opponents . 
  to the very point , that in germany , there is always a proper reason as a requirement for someone to even reach the point of deportation . 
  in essence , these morons plan to prevent people whose asylum application failed ... from being deported . 
  not to mention those sentenced to deportation because of illegal or sinister activities ( yes , i read the article , and no , i do not trust them that this will not be a sidelined issue as well ) ... 
   so how does croatia pick president ? 
  croatia is not a presidential republic but a parliamentary one . 
  the president is utterly irrelevant . 
  luka 2 . 
  ivan 5 . 
  petar 6 . 
  fran 10 . 
  david girls ; 1 . 
  lucija 3 . 
  ema 5 . 
  dora 9 . 
  marta 10 . 
  sara not as slavic as i hoped , but then again , not as westernized as i feared either . 
  not so sure about that , in croatia a lot of them are ethnically tied to croats ; hrvoje , zvonimir , tomislav , berislav , kazimir , domagoj etc. 
   ten-foot pole that is one big ass pole . 
  hahaha , you have no idea just how much you proved my point with that question , despite its purpose . 
  but yeah , the majority vote electing within a representative democracy is far from the absolute majority rule . 
  [ legen/kries - zumba ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgth4jaf-g8 ) [ moj javore ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kouss7ngf8 ), 
   honestly , this is how all democracy should work . 
  i love it . 
  uh , the majority vote is not always good . 
  i suspect croatia would become a catholic theocracy within 5-10 years . 
  beautiful city . 
  at first glance , it looks like croatia annexed bosnia . 
  such pretty borders , nice . 
   try to invade britain ? 
  adorable . 
  [ yeah , about that .
