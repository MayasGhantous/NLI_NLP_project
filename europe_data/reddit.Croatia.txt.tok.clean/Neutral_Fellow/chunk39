  it became quite important culturally during the national awakening of the 19th century . 
  it is also quite popular in japan for an interesting reason ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqqf_92dghm, 
  i see . 
   we 've had several non-white miss france i did not mean in france particularly , but on the interwebs in general . 
   also i do n't think the fact her father is a white `` frenchman '' changes anything . 
  i disagree . 
  it makes her technically a native french through ethnicity , not just a citizen of france or its overseas territories . 
  meaning , the usual tropes put against foreigners can not work against her . 
  then again , i grew up in the balkans so i probably have a much different worldview and point of view about these things . 
   but then again , french women never are . 
  here is one of the contestants for miss france ; http://img.xooimage.com/files110/6/b/b/12473533_50310471...753932_o-4ee55d9.jpg, 
  yes , for the worse in turkeys example , as kurdish fertility rates are far above turkish . 
  alright . 
  hahaha , that is incredible . 
  where did you pulled that from ? 
  i merely see the issue of an-exxon chair being secretary of state . 
  i came here to say ; `` color me surprised . '', 
  but then realized it would sound kinda racist . 
  her father is a white frenchman though , so i doubt it will be that much of an uproar . 
  also , she looks far better with the [ downward curles ] ( http://s1.lprs1.fr/images/2016/12/18/6468783_000-j83zf_1000x625.jpg ) .

  do they eat stuff when you offer them ? 
  or do i just get the plague and call it a day ? 
  i always wanted to go to balaton . 
  as a mediterranean , i would like to experience a sweetwater sea for once . 
  imo , and not to offend turks here but , i believe strongly ( from what i gathered so far ) that turkey is heading into the serbia-kosovo situation , you can not solve such an ethnic problem with mere governmental policies . 
  demography is destiny . 
  kurdistan is inevitable . 
  well , they look like buddies to me ; http://i.imgur.com/gtrvqdk.jpg . . buddy . 
   tillerson is n't buddy buddy with putin . 
  dude , he met putin dozens of times and putin decided to personally pin a medal of friendship on his chest ( yes , literally , google it ) . 
  russia has a multi billion dollar contract with exxon that has been frozen because of the sanctions , i fear their former chair would have some reason to lift the sanctions and let the money flow . 
  the deal between exxon and russia is being called `` the 500 billion exchange '' , this is not spare change . 
  it was more of a commentary thing . 
  it is still a question what the usa will do . 
  that new harkonnen secretary of state of theirs is a very , very good buddy with putin . 
  i still remember in the 2009ish years when everyone was talking about all of us ( from cro to macedonia ) joining as a block in 2014-16 . 
  another blow to the reputation of gypsies : l, 
   you have no way of knowing that actually , i do . 
  there are tons of articles published to date about the issues plaguing the gmd , sdi , gpals , nmd or whatever else set of tax payer money holes they plan to replace the last series of fumbles with . 
  their effectiveness are laughable as they fail often even in scripted exercises . 
  the us rocket shield would even have issues against china or iran if they had the reach , this is stated publicly by numerous high ranks . 
  to end ; `` defending the united states against a major russian or chinese ballistic missile attack is currently ** not feasible ** . 
  a reliable defense that could protect america against a russian icbm and slbm force that could launch some 1,500 ballistic missile warheads ** simply does not exist ** . 
  while the chinese force is much smaller , numbering several dozen icbms , it probably includes countermeasures that would seriously complicate disruption by missile defense systems . '', 
  - steven pifer, 
  you can not stop the sheer numbers of them . 
  counting on the feasibility of a rocket shield against icbm 's is naive folly . 
  aircraft carriers will not matter at all if the nukes start flying . 
  the entirety of that enormous usa military budged will be utterly irrelevant . 
  i was corrected by the other interlocutor and i apologized . 
   well you are trying to turn this into a fascist vs anti-fascist debate . 
  well , my bad if it seems that way , but that was not my intent . 
   i dont think its an overreaction alright . 
   hence why i said far-side extremists , not far-right . 
  i apologize , i misread your words . 
  i do not understand your question . 
   when it is so hard to make it relate to the topic . 
  how is it hard to relate ? 
  there are very few demonstrators in the image with a large number of police officers . 
  this is a result of such events being overblown constantly and considered high risk despite most being peaceful . 
   well i think its obvious , far-side extremists are much more prone to violence and the nature of their ideologies ( the fact that they are far ) drives them towards conflict the easiest . 
  i disagree , especially after 2013-2015 actions . 
  both the far right and the far left had terrorist organizations in the past decades and both participated in riots , looting , assaults and swarms of other examples of violence . 
  lol , everything i write seems to be some kind of agenda apparently . 
  how sinister of me . 
  in reality , i was merely making fun of how overblown such demonstrations are and especially clashes between such right wingers and antifas in the media . 
  they nearly always ad some 0 's to the numbers involved and hype it up as much as possible . 
  the one in the train is the most famous example of this , that is why i linked the video . 
  my apologies for not being more obvious . 
  [ shame 10 000 antifa did not interviene and declared victory over the fashist masses ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9_yj8vhpxs ), 
  you forgot to mention their ** roads ** , 400 000 kilometres of them . 
  also , contrary to popular belief , lorica segmentata was not their most popular armor , but rather lorica hamata . 
  i disagree . 
   does n't that mean you want to always put your country first correct . 
  currently , being pro-eu ** is ** putting my country first . 
   but the core focus of nationalism is that , unless you want to change the meaning of words to suit the marketing that is not the core of nationalism , merely one aspect . 
   then you do n't know much about the eu , we give a fairly share of our sovereignty to brussels . 
  like forcing member states to legislate in accordance to eu directives or get economic sanctions against others states . 
  that is not merely a surrender of sovereignty , that is an agreement between countries within an union for the betterment of all . 
  an agreement of alliance is not the same as vassalage . 
   if i do n't in account the historical meaning and its ideologic reason then the terms are meaningless . 
  you are not just accounting it , you are mirroring it to the present . 
  ideologies evolve , and if you study nationalism as a whole , you will realize that even back then it was not as strictly defined as you see it . 
  nationalism does not even have to be right wing , or conservative , let alone enslaved by concepts of the most popular/successful versions of it from the past . 
   but a nationalist is defined by his inherent value of the nation over any external force , and it the supremacy of national sovereignty . 
  that is merely one aspect , one that can be sidelined in favor of another viewpoint that stems on the focus of national interest instead of self-determination . 
  not to mention that the eu hardly effects national sovereignty in serious matters , such as of foreign or internal policy . 
   i can see why you like the eu but that goes against everything nationalism stands for . 
  it really does n't . 
  i believe your definition of nationalism is quite dosed by a history-caused tunnel vision . 
  i stated that i was a ;  pro-eu nationalist not an eu nationalist . 
   the underlying principles and actions of the union is one of anti nationalism . 
  no , it is not , because its ultimate goal is still not eradicating the political entities that make it up . 
  even if it formed up as a federation ( which will not happen for decades ) , the countries will still exist as separate entities , and therefore the interests of said countries can still be considered within the union . 
   how can a nationalist prefer a supranational union ? 
  because that supranational union is bettering his country . 
  croatia is far better now as a country precisely because of the pressures the eu pushed onto our political class to westernize and modernize . 
  we were a corrupt hellhole before the eu talks . 
   but that does n't qualify as nationalism .
