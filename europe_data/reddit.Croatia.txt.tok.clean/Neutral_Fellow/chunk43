  imo karl magnus is the most badass name option , even though `` der gro\u00dfe '' would be used with karl . 
  we call him karlo veliki . 
  oh , so as soon as charlemagne arrived with his armies , you saw an opportunity , and you took it , 
  as long as it is n't a road trip to brittany . 
   the slovenes are just the austrian which were too lazy to learn german . 
  perhaps austrians are just slavs who were too lazy to keep talking slovene and switched to german ? 
  not according to our deal with franz ferdinand and his crew ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trialism_in_austria-hungary https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/trialisticki_zemljevid_bec_1905_henrik_hanau.jpg, 
  protip ; if you find a pale woman with glowing blue eyes encased in ice , try not to have magic sex with her and start your own warlock kingdom . 
  immediate . 
  deportation . 
  eh , they are basically just native caucasian anatolians with sprinkles of whatever invader came there over the past 3000 years . 
  now that is refreshing . 
  finally a positive project that might have some importance . 
  my great-grandpa had a similar experience with his wife . 
  he was the only croat in his entire chetnik group , because he married a serb woman who had no brothers , so they both ended up living in her families house in a 99 % serbian village far away from his home village . 
  while his group were fighting the `` divljaci '' somewhere in hercegovina , another chetnik band came into the village and took his wife and kids because she was married to a croat . 
  he only found the body of the wife after about 15 years , never the children . 
  since the rest of my family were in the ustashi , he could not go home , thus he lived the rest of his life alone in his wife 's village . 
  that is , after the partizans let him out the `` internment camp '' . 
  this is bizarre to say the least . 
  fuck it , just crumble then . 
  why have political entities if borders mean nothing ? 
  it is like , out of the sudden , the concept of a country and enforcement of law stopped having any meaning . 
  [ ah , the jolly warlord of the caucasus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn8acuofesk ), 
  phew ; http://i.imgur.com/ftv55na.png good luck turks , you 're gon na need it . 
  everyone has an in-group preference . 
  the issue is that fans of multiculturalism like to completely ignore human biology and sociology . 
  for that reason they keep getting surprised that tribalism is still , shockingly , inherent in human nature regardless of how many bracelets they give out . 
  [ i was thinking more in the line of this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cr1xng9kyii&amp;t=0m40s ), 
  happy birthday lakeland . 
  i would have never even consider it to be on that level of casualty rates . 
  dear god , the cold war just does not stop giving . 
  uh , 50ish million dollars down the deep blue . 
  ca n't say i am surprised , the us had its fair share of carrier related incidents and their pilots have been perfecting it for over half a century . 
  how many carrier landings do you think an average russian pilot gets to have , with russia having only a single one that spends the vast majority of its operational year idle in a port ? 
  lol , why the hell is kithira in attica ? 
  to be fair , in some countries terrorism is terrifying because of the impact it can cause on the economy . 
  for instance , turkeys economy took a huge hit because of the bombings , not only from foreign investment slowdown it caused , but also the hit on tourism , so much so that their currency is in a constant downfall now . 
  i believe that it a series of terrorist attacks happened in croatia , our frail economy would tank completely . 
   think about this a little bit more thoroughly . 
  like 10 years ago . 
  [ one ticket for fhloston paradiseee ] ( https://j.gifs.com/r0brlw.gif ), 
  here is an update he did ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pifo1dynjg, 
  mosul will not fall until spring of 2017 , even if that . 
  also , mosul is not their most important city , it is raqqa . 
  i am not arguing that it is . 
  [ what the red in the distance reminds me of ] ( https://j.gifs.com/qj6kmr.gif ), 
  oh , my bad then . 
  my source seems to be way off . 
  i edited out my post . 
  edit ; source was wrong , he was captured in 1944, 
  aka the eu 's evil twin . 
  jk aside , i often wonder when i see a sssr map , what could have become of all those countries if only the white army won the civil war . 
  it does to me . 
  age of structures is important , it is not the same if a 20 year house is demolished than one 100 years old with more history and family tied to it . 
  were they ? 
  because a lot of contemporary sources state the city was basically in russian palms until the british fleet came and `` dissuaded '' the russians from assaulting the walls . 
  do n't care , mine are matchlock muzzle loaders , outside the grip of the law . 
   french and british . 
  the french and british are the main reason the ottomans lasted that long . 
  the russian army was at the gates of istanbul when they intervened . 
  your women are apparently even better than your men . 
  holy god 12.9 compared to our 1.6 o_o, 
  you replace the saudi 's with the much more westernized hashemite royal family and give the arabian shia population their own state . 
  not necessarily . 
  you merely replace the saudi 's with the much more westernized hashemite royal family and give the saudi shia population their own state . 
  i did not mean kill them all lol . 
  the saudi royal family needs to be destroyed . 
   and blew up a thousand year old bridge * 400 year old, 
   old . 
  i do n't think it will last very long . 
  true , but i think that the 1100 second language mentioned bellow are simply their kids/relatives who learned croatian first in school . 
  istro-romanian is still alive , but dwindling ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istro-romanian_language, 
  well , it would seem it is another forward step for kosovo in diplomacy . 
  i worry about the fact that the same exact ethnic reason and principle of kosovo 's independence will probably be enacted in the russian populated crimea . 
  if a decision is made about it also becoming an independent country , how will anyone argue against it if they supported kosovo ? 
   aka the date we decided catalonia was more worth than portugal . 
  huh ? 
  even with all them portuguese colonies ? 
   we will fucking evangelise mars . 
  onwards conquistadores [ onwards into the unknown ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94dy-qxjdie ), 
  yep . 
  yes , and then they just work overtime without asking for payment for the overtime , dropping the hourly wage up to a third , pretty easy workaround . 
  nope . 
  the only thing that they do hold is the large waste disposal stuff , selling iron , metals etc. 
  huh , how come the green is only on the tower then ? 
  it was done on purpose ? 
  the usual counter is that they are prepared to work for much less . 
  is the house a newer built compared to the tower ? 
  wonder if that underpass flyby was actually done like that . 
  alright , i will look into this . 
  thanks . 
  so sad that they cancelled that large scale couples waltz that was talked about years ago . 
  here in croatia , i can honestly say that i have never in my life , literally never , seen a roma working at a job . 
  yes , that is about wages , not job competition . 
  crazy how a countries integrity and borders have even become a stuff of discussion . 
  political entities should have the right to halt anyone trying to cross illegally , instead we have the italian navy basically functioning as a ferry service and picking up people off the coast of libya to transport them to europe . 
  europe wreaks of weakness , and to understand the mindset of a good portion of the people coming here ; `` but of late mr tibi has turned pessimistic . 
  mrs merkel 's welcome last year , he thinks , could even turn germany into a `` failed state '' . 
  recently , he spoke with ten young syrians .
