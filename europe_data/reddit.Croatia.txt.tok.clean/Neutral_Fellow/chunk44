  `` two of them spoke german , were doing well , and reminded me of myself back then , '' he says . 
  `` the other eight were telling me that ** allah gave us germany as a refuge , not the germans . 
  ** most syrians and other muslims , he now thinks , will never integrate , instead retreating into misogynistic , anti-semitic and anti-democratic worldviews and segregating themselves in radicalised enclaves . '', 
   there 's great growth , but no overpopulation . 
  dude , nigeria alone is projected to overtake the population of the usa within decades ... 
  huh . 
  but what about the job market itself ? 
  do n't migrants often cause natives to lose their jobs by out competing them through lower wage demand ? 
  gon na honk my dacia first thing in the morning . 
  great news . 
  it has to , otherwise it 's another war in the balkans . 
  does this make the leavers separatist , and in turn , farage their leader ? 
  [ ** cough cough cough ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3ed_vu5z4q ), 
  bosnia should be the primary candidate . 
  the eu is the only thing that could keep it from falling apart . 
  horrible . 
  the smoke must have been rampant if 12 could not get away . 
  this is gon na rustle some major jimmies . 
  hence my statement had life sentence as the first option . 
  firing squads are n't as antiquated as you might think . 
  the last person to be executed by firing squad in the usa was in 2010 . 
   he gave away secret information , allegedly gathering information on the times and details of raids against extremists . 
  this is straight up high treason . 
  either a life sentence or the firing squad , anything less will undermine the institutions . 
  first of all , even if the crescent was identical , it still would not be the same coa , not even remotely close . 
  secondly , the crescent is not even the same , one is checkered and the other is pure white . 
  are you blind ? 
   its from kranjska egel . 
  it is not the same coa . 
   i think my stamps proved you wrong nope . 
   the kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107es didnt realy care about estetic conbinig of the coats of arms . 
  it is not the same coat of arms at all ...  if you use the usta\u0161 koat of army , why not use the swastika ? 
  it is not the ustashi coat of arms though . 
   the botom part , its the cresent from the egle , you can also read the law of it and the wiki article . 
  how is that the same thing ? 
   your logic not my . 
  no , your personal reasoning to my argument . 
   lol why ? 
  we liberated our land under the fivepointed , we killed the nazis and the usta\u0161e under the fivepointed . 
  no reason to do so . 
  ah , now i see what you are . 
  shame , and here i thought you were actually just arguing against symbols of hate and totalitarianism . 
  the red star of the communists killed insane amounts of people just as the swastika of ze nazi 's did . 
  but i guess that does not matter to you . 
   sure thing i do not see the carniola coa . 
   so what , its older than that , lets all jump around with swastikas on the croatian flag . 
  ridiculous reasoning . 
   if i were the guy writing paris pece i would have outlawed those . 
  good thing you were n't . 
  would you ban the communist symbols as well ? 
   actualy it was used as the slovenian enblem in the coat of arms in the kingdom of yugoslavia . 
  ( the one that had 3 partitions 1 for ech nation ) could you provide that coat of arms please ? 
   ok so why not use the swastika ? 
  because , as a state symbol , it was used specifically by and for the nazi regime . 
  a more appropriate comparison would be the german eagle , the iron cross or the balkenkreuz , all of which were used extensively by the nazi 's and yet all are still in use by germany because they were n't formed as political symbols by the nazi regime . 
  which is why this is not problematic ; https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/eurofighter_typhoon_5.jpg http://www.fahrzeugbilder.de/1024/panzer-leopard-ii-hohn-2011-61077.jpg, 
  except that emblem was never used as a coa for slovenia as a political entity , while the white first checkerboard was used for croatia . 
  also , yes , i agree that a slovene should have no issues displaying the coa of carniola . 
  centuries of history should not be stomped out just because some fucknuts waved some flags around for a couple years . 
   so this guy is just waring a random helmet than ? 
  oh gee , guess skulls and bones are also a nazi symbol now ; http://media.liveauctiongroup.net/i/10949/11386255_1.jpg?v=8ce616579dff450 guess piratebay are nazi 's now . 
   pleas you know its is now a usta\u0161i symbol . 
  it 's not , it is hundreds of years older than them ; http://forum.net.hr/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver.components.imagefileviewer/communityserver.discussions.components.files.15/7853.17.-stolje_0701_e_2c00_-1675.-fojni_0d01_ki-grbovnik.jpg_2d00_550x0.jpg, 
  it means that the ustachi used the checkerboard , nothing more , notice the u above it and the wavy symbol around it ; this is the ndh flag ; http://www.njuskalo.hr/image-w920x690/militarija/zastava-ndh-slika-60659202.jpg without those symbols , the checkerboard is merely a historical coat of arms , with white first appearing centuries before the ustachi ; http://www.hkv.hr/images/stories/slike05/slavonija_5/7_jagelovic-talir-bosna.jpg http://www.hkv.hr/images/stories/slike05/slavonija_5/11_mohac_hrvatska.jpg, 
  what the dutch should do with that letter ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3dg8vy91iq, 
  that is not a pro-nazi regime symbol lol . 
  learn about croatian coat of arms first before making such ridiculous statements . 
  my brother remained catholic for the sole purpose of getting married in a fancy church by a guy in a fancy outfit and a fancy hat , instead of some boring place by some boring clerk . 
   poland does n't invade [ boleslav laughs at this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/boleslaus_i.jpg ), 
  it happens sometimes . 
  not knowing things . 
  even when one is french . 
  magnificent . 
  i love it . 
  damn , that is a lot better than i thought . 
  yes , we all should , bareback and beyond . 
  it is true . 
  syrian fertility was dropping for decades before the civil war and syria actually had negative growth just before the outbreak of the conflict . 
   turkey the only country above the replacement rate most of that are kurds though , which is very bad news for turkey . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5hrugfhsxo&amp;t=1m10s ), 
  lol , no shit . 
  the very fact this is even discussed wreaks of weakness . 
  pathetic . 
  when smaller countries do not side into larger alliances , they tend to become prey for more powerful outsiders ( like the ones in the video ) . 
  yugoslavia is no more , our countries are now irrelevant and we need to join political groups . 
  korean corporate forcing serb workers not only to bow out of respect , but to go face on the floor to show submission . 
  all of this for cca 200 euro 's per month . 
  the company even faced some public backlash in korea because of insulting stuff like this , as it makes korea look bad . 
  [ well , good luck with that .

  anyone picking up boatloads of people off the coast of libya is well past being in a position to lecture anyone about borders or migration of any kind . 
  erm , yes ? 
  that is a single example drowned in an ocean of low sentences , probations and outings for good behavior . 
  also , he will be out in 6-7 years tops , i bet my balls on it . 
  he will be enjoying that high class european `` muh rehabilitation muh recidivism '' prison lifestyle while laughing at the tax payers . 
   i hope this guy will be locked away for a long time as someone who used to live in germany ; hahahaha , good one . 
   which is not true lol , come on . 
  what percentage of immigrants in germany no longer identify by their primary ethnicity ? 
   my best friends parents are french , but he does feel german 100 % good anecdote bro . 
   only a small part of turks even votes like 99.99 % of them still identify as turks , even 3nd and 3rd generation .
