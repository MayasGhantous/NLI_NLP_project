  oh , lol , i thought you meant historically . 
  my bad . 
  i doubt that very much . 
  it is either a local clothing development or something connected to iranic tribes before the turkic migrations , turkic peoples had a very different clothing tradition .

   while most of the country was black or mixed-race . 
  you make it sound as if white people are some upper societal caste there . 
  nearly half the population there is white , only 2 % are black . 
  magnificent . 
  you come from a strange world where students payed attention at history class . 
  when i was in school , there was me and one other dude who gave a toss about any of it . 
  also , i would wager about 99 % of regular folks around would not be able to connect the minotaur or the troyan war to minoans or myceneans , they would most likely ( even if that ) just vaguely connect it to ancient greece in general . 
  from my experience , rarely anyone outside historiography and history buffs knows of them . 
  minoans and myceneans are quite overlooked compared to other civilizations of the time , partly because their writing system still remains undeciphered . 
  i am not arguing about the word . 
   `` racism '' these days is used to indicate any ethnic or religious discrimination . 
  which is wrong ... and stupid .

   red hair has historically been regarded as evil not usually , not most of the time . 
  that bridge is not ogive though . 
   it is likely the genoese got inspired by the arabs to my knowledge , it was both who got inspired by medieval romans . 
  even during the ottoman empire , when they had arguably the best military force on earth , it took them decades for every country they faced , because conquest is difficult . 
  hell , it took them over 150 years to conquer modern day bosnia , because again , conquering mountainous areas is hard . 
  in today 's terms , they most likely would not be able to push through greece and bulgaria at all if they really went apeshit .

  no , it hardened their resolve for revenging that defeat , which they kinda did , but that battle did absolutely decide roman politics towards germania for the rest of the existence of the empire . 
  basically , the river rhine was fortified and it was decided that there will be no more pushes eastwards towards denmark and the elbe as some desired to do up even until the death of germanicus . 
  had this battle not happened as it did , it is possible that the whole germania would have the same fate as gaul .

  well , videos like this piece and similar themed ones , like refugee pieces , always attract certain `` elements '' from both outside reddit and their sections of reddit , it has become nearly a ritual . 
  but you are right and it should be stated for what it is when that is the case . 
   if your views on hundreds of thousands of black people on the continent , with all kinds of different backgrounds , are defined by some absurd video huh , from what i 've seen , most comments are aimed at leftist whites as the vague traitors , not black people , or even the dude in the video . 
  though , it could be just my selective scrolling , noticing different comments from those that you do . 
   i have provided plenty of evidence . 
  i 've seen none . 
   im quoting and linking to literally alt right comments . 
  where ? 
   so you are actually doing the `` oh so everyone you disagree with is alt right '' ? 
  yeah , because nobody seems to actually understand wtf alt right even is by this point . 
   supporting diversity . 
  not the same as stating that diversity , by itself , is inherently a strengthening factor of a society . 
  also , it was just banter . 
   the man still lives in the first part of the 1800s you mean from then to anywhere throughout the 20th century in europe and basically to this day on most of the planet . 
   espousing an mystically based ideology that has long been considered pseudoscience in academia no , it is not pseudoscience , as it basically can not be . 
  certain claims tied to such ideologies definitely are though . 
  `` diversity is our ... ah , forget it , too easy . 
   so now that all my comments criticizing the alt right are getting downvoted they are getting downvoted because the comments are idiotic . 
  firstly , the european right wing is n't alt-right and the amount of the american alt-right here is barely noticeable aside from a few comments on a refugee themed thread here and there . 
  secondly , the alt right in this sub gets downvoted to oblivion when transparent . 
  thirdly , you , as a lot of others , just keep grouping basically everything sidelined from your own tunnel vision politics into the alt right . 
  stating that r/europe is alt right is ridiculous . 
  that is why you are being downvoted . 
   you need to build some kind of feeling with the characters then you do it with the main characters , not some side slave soldier and a secretary .

  eh , i 've seen more black chicks and veiled up me girls in arms of your irishmen when i was up there than the opposite . 
   the legality of it is actually what matters . 
  it both matters . 
   you want people and organizations to act differently . 
  but there is no way to make that happen within the legal framework . 
  that 's all . 
  erm , i never even suggested that those who misinvited the man should have been legally forced to reinvite them . 
  i was merely using it as an example of an organization catering to a religion for no reason . 
   how would you like to implement changes to political correctness ? 
  what is your solution ? 
  criticizing it . 
   yes , indeed . 
  you are ignoring the thing that matters most . 
  there is either a major language barrier here or you are purposefully sidelining the discussion . 
   people and organizations are free to decide how they 're going to act within the legal framework . 
  i am not arguing against that at all . 
   if they want to be political correct , they can be !, 
  absolutely however , that does not mean they should not be criticized for it . 
   getting invited and then banned because something happened is basically the same as when something happens and he is n't invited in the first place . 
  no , it is n't . 
  because the first requires an action of inviting him and then the action of disinviting him , both with cause , while the other requires nothing . 
   dawkins ' rights towards the organization have nothing to do wether it 's a religious org . 
  or not .
