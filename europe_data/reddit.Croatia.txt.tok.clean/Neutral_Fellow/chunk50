  the ruling class would be defeated and the underclass , the 99 % , would just continue existing under new rule . 
  like , bulgarians have barely any trace of turkic in them for a reason ; sena karachanak , viola grugni , simona fornarino , desislava nesheva , nadia al-zahery , vincenza battaglia , valeria carossa , yordan yordanov , antonio torroni , angel s. galabov , draga toncheva , and ornella semino . 
  `` y-chromosome diversity in modern bulgarians : new clues about their ancestry . '', 
  plos one 8:3 ( march 6 , 2013 ) : e56779 . 
  following its presentation at conferences in the years 2011 and 2012 ( see further below ) , this y-dna study has now been released as an electronic open-access publication . 
  the number of bulgarian males in the final report is 808 , not the 809 or 812 they counted at the conferences , so there must have been problems with 4 of the samples . 
  the study declares , `` only individuals whose fathers were of bulgarian origin and were born in the country were included in the study . 
  excerpts from the abstract : `` haplogroups c , n and q , distinctive for altaic and central asian turkic-speaking populations , occur at the negligible frequency of ** only 1.5 % . 
  ** '' - `` on the whole , in light of the most recent historical studies , which indicate a substantial proto-bulgarian input to the contemporary bulgarian people , our data suggest that a common paternal ancestry between the proto-bulgarians and ** the altaic and central asian turkic-speaking populations either did not exist or was negligible . 
  wtf are you talking about ? 
  the current genetic connection between the mediterranean and north africa and the middle east is a result of roughly 15 000 years of slow migrations , trade and connections , not because of some ridiculous notion of domestic women constantly whoring themselves out lol . 
  the vast majority of greeks in the ottoman empire survived and lived , married between themselves , just as the turks did . 
  similarly , the vast , vast majority of muslims in former muslim spain and sicily were ** native converts ** , not some medieval boat migrants . 
  hell , even the few that did settle and married locally , `` surrendered '' their own genes just as the natives did , since the female bloodline continued as well . 
  for fuck sake the fifth caliph of cordoba is described as a ** pale blue eyed dude ** lol . 
  you are also forgetting that the entire area was under the same political entity ( rome ) for nearly 600 years and then 700 years more when you take in the eastern roman empire , with people moving about freely under roman domination . 
  the very notion you propose is ridiculous , as by that view , modern algerians and tunisians are actually germanic vandals with a deep tan . 
  globalization is good , but should be postponed for at least 50-60 years as a concept . 
  the only ones accepting its main form are westerners while everyone else still just roots for their own team . 
   and extremely unfair for a democracy ( the voting process heavily favored the wealthy and patricians , for example ) . 
  it was far better than the vast majority of all other political entities of the period , which were nearly all utterly despotic in nature . 
   legionaries were given cheaper , lighter equipment to offset the costs of having to arm a huge standing army , and the role of cavalry in the legion was greatly expanded in order to ensure that the legion was more mobile . 
  in this way , the legion could move across the empire 's borders more quickly to intercept attackers , and the empire 's armies became more geared towards rapid reaction and mobile operations . 
  and it worked right up until ... 
  so it did work though . 
   still , it really did n't help that the western empire did n't have access to the resources of the east . 
  ... what resources ? 
  it is a fact that the east was richer but only marginally so . 
  in fact italy was the richest region until the late 4th century , not the eastern provinces . 
   yep . 
  how the sacking of constantinople during the fourth crusade was caused in part due to a byzantine power play . 
  true , i would even argue in large part . 
  similarly how the sack of rome in 410 itself was largely caused by the emperor being a moron ... which is why i still argue that an active senate would be a superior option to the dominate . 
  even if they kept the emperor but with less power it would have perhaps saved rome , or at least prolonged the empire imo . 
   the republic was a shitty system in and of itself , and returning to it would probably end badly . 
  i disagree . 
  especially when you consider the societal changes during late antiquity and what would eventually happen through the medieval period . 
  hell , compare a republic system like venice and how much less internal infighting they had compared to the rest of monarchical/despotic europe . 
   but it ca n't be ignored that the roman empire literally did n't have enough legions to defend it 's borders . 
  then how did they keep them for centuries on end ? 
   these issues , both internal and external , were essentially impossible to deal with for an empire as resource-starved as the western roman empire , so it fell . 
  i disagree . 
  the much bigger issue was the set of bad decisions made during the migrations and with the auxiliary forces . 
  rome still had most of the west under its control as late as the early 5th century . 
  even after the sack of rome ( which was again rome 's fault ) in 410 , the empire still retained control over most of the west in a number of events before the final blows , first by the vandals in 430s when they took africa and , of course , in the end by odoacer . 
   the eastern roman empire obviously did a lot better due to the fact that it was way , way richer , except , before the onslaught started happening , it was n't `` way way richer '' at all . 
  eastern rome survived because it was outside basically all german migration routes and because it had a set of more capable rulers than those fielded in italy . 
   but eventually they faded away too . 
  yeah , after like 700 years ...  the external pressures are way more easily observable there , but internal politics probably did n't help . 
  i agree with you that it was both , but without the internal ones being so rampant , the external ones could have been dealt with . 
  yes , that was the wealth of the state treasury , not personal wealth . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  romans clearly separated groups of people from other germanics , they even separated germanic tribes into various groups . 
  romans had contact with germanic tribes for 700 years by that point . 
  we have a clear set of information about the migrations of slavs at the time , and they were nowhere close the roman border during the 5th century . 
   like throughout europe , people have either some jewish , roma , turkish , inuit , mongol , arab ancestry considering our history , and now in modern times it will also be other ethnic groups that will add admixtures . 
  you 'd be surprised just how little trace there is of anything further than a couple villages downhill . 
  hell , the bulgars have barely any trace of turkic in them , let alone anyone else ; sena karachanak , viola grugni , simona fornarino , desislava nesheva , nadia al-zahery , vincenza battaglia , valeria carossa , yordan yordanov , antonio torroni , angel s. galabov , draga toncheva , and ornella semino .

  ** ''  in america , many ` white ' people are completely unaware of their sub-saharan ancestry , which regularly scores at least few percentages on ethnic dna tests there . 
  that is actually quite rare . 
  interracial marriage was barely present until fairly recently , so like 99.99 % of all people either have 0 % or are obviously biracial since their subsaharan part would be a part of the last few generations ( grandparents or parents ) . 
   the haplogroup considered to be most tied with indo-european expansions were r1 subclades what ? 
  source ? 
   it 's complicated . 
  nope . 
   they do and do n't they do n't . 
   y-dna haplogroups are used in population genetics to describe migrations often , though . 
  yes , but only through vague interpretations and wide time frames . 
   it would 've developed as a corrupt and unstable dictatorship it would be possible for the republic to return eventually , or at least for the principate system to return , with the emperor being just the first among the senate . 
   honestly , though , one of the principal reasons for the ( western ) empire 's demise is that it 's immensity was unsustainable due to the lack of manpower which was required to defend it . 
  it 's size was crippling . 
  well , not really , they sustained the size for centuries and could have done it longer . 
  the issue were internal struggles and conflicts that constantly weakened the empire during the 4th and 5th century until chunks of it started falling off . 
   and slavic immigrants slavs came a century after the demise of western rome . 
  mansa musa was close to crassus , but the richest of all was likely augustus , as his wealth is calculated by some at over 1.5 trillion , multiple times more than both of those . 
   http://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2010-08-13 right ... because a dude who way young in the 1980s sure lives the same life then as he does now ... 
  i would rather have whatever eu is possible to maintain . 
  these guys are suspected of being actual isis soldiers , not just random radicalized muslims . 
  people will stop aging and dying within the next few decades because of technology , this will soon become a non issue . 
   but kicking the autocratic leaning country out . 
  sure way to end up with a 4 member eu . 
  poland democratically elected autocrats , deal with it ( they sure as hell will have to ) . 
  you do realize that guy was a servant of the british empire and that his `` kingdom '' as you put it was a british prince province in india ? 
   iranians accepted poles i do not see poles refusing iranians or some large iranian migration though . 
   an indian king with no connection to any colonial empire erm what ? 
   i mean they could have just as easily acted as disgusting xenophobes . 
  yeah , they could . 
  but poles were legit war refugees . 
   but we will just leave it to v4 to be the ungrateful ones . 
  poland accepted more war refugees from ukraine than germany did refugees in total . 
  it is possible that i am misinformed then . 
  i will look into this . 
  i will look into this .
