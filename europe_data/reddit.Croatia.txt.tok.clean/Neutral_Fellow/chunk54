   you are free to provide more rigid evidence for your claim i already did . 
  but if you like primary sources , here is one that puts the muslim force at more than ** 300 000 ** ; `` the muslims planned to go to tours to destroy the church of st. martin , the city , and the whole country . 
  then came against them the glorious prince charles , at the head of his whole force . 
  he drew up his host , and he fought as fiercely as the hungry wolf falls upon the stag . 
  by the grace of our lord , he wrought a great slaughter upon the enemies of christian faith , so that -- as history bears witness -- he slew in that battle 300,000 men , likewise their king by name abderrahman . 
  then was he [ charles ] first called `` martel , '' for as a hammer of iron , of steel , and of every other metal , even so he dashed : and smote in the battle all his enemies . 
  and what was the greatest marvel of all , he only lost in that battle 1500 men . 
  the tents and harness [ of the enemy ] were taken ; and whatever else they possessed became a prey to him and his followers . 
  eudes , duke of aquitaine , being now reconciled with prince charles martel , later slew as many of the saracens as he could find who had escaped from the battle . '', 
  - chronicle of st. denis  but the burden of proof is now definitely on you , if it was n't clear that it was on you from the start . 
  erm , if the other person in the discussion is rebutting a statement of the first , than the burden of proof is on him , or at best on both of them , not just the first person . 
   have n't you slept well or why are you so aggressively condescending ? 
  erm , i am not condescending at all , it is just that i had to repeat myself for the third time already despite giving an obvious explanation what `` one of the largest '' means . 
   so did the battle of siffin the primary sources state similar numbers as at tours , the modern estimates equally so . 
   or the battle of the zab a single primary source obviously exaggerating the umayyad army while the modern estimates , again , put it right around the numbers at tours . 
   every time the central government in syria needed to mobilize its full strength it was able to assemble much larger armies than the one that fought at tours . 
  prove it . 
   that battle was far from one of the largest ever fought by the umayyads . 
  you have not proven this at all . 
  for christians , the answer is obvious . 
  people constantly state that christians had rights under muslim rule and only had to pay the jizya tax to be left alone , but this was merely on paper in the same sense that black people in the us became legally citizens with citizen rights after the civil war . 
  while generally present , it did not mean that black people were equal or even close to having a near equal treatment under the whites who lived around them . 
  so , if some muslim dude showed up and decided to rape or kill some christians , the fact that they had rights did not change that fact that the chances of him being sentenced in a muslim court at that time were quite low . 
  in the basic sense , christians lived in the muslim world at the complete mercy of even the most ordinary muslim citizen or farmer , as they could be done to as any muslim who came about them wished to do to them , at will . 
  similarly , large numbers of jews lived in europe and had various degrees of rights , but time and time again they would be mistreated or even massacred , most often without any repercussions to the christian perpetrators , for the same exact reason as stated above . 
  so no , living as a christian in andalus was not a good life . 
   how is the siege of constantinople not important here ? 
  it was an engagement fought by umayyad forces and its size most certainly dwarfed that of the battle at tours . 
  as i said ;  one of the largest battles the umayyads fought the fact that there was another , larger battle , does not rebut my statement at all . 
   the forces the umayyads could bring into play against byzantium were simply much larger than anything the emir of cordoba could hope to organize . 
  again , completely irrelevant to the discussion . 
   on the other hand your examples about the conquest of egypt and persia are n't nearly as relevant as they happened before the umayyads ascended to the throne . 
  they are , as they are response to your statement of armies of `` low tens of thousands being small , not about the comparison to the main campaign against constantinople . 
   so again , i don 's see how tours was one of the largest battles ever fought by the umayyads . 
  incredible . 
  alright ; if one man is larger than the another within a group , while that other man is still taller than most , then that second man is still ** one of ** the tallest in the room ? 
  is that straightlined enough for you to comprehend ? 
  the fact that there was a larger battle does not denote that another battle was still ** one of ** the largest . 
   u/deyga is absolutely right to point out that it was n't nearly as important to the caliphate than what was happening in the east at the same time . 
  yes , that is absolutely correct . 
  ... and completely besides the point . 
   even if they did conquer it , they would n't be able to keep it for long . 
  not so sure about that one . 
  with a separate caliphate of cordoba forming inevitably quite soon after the battle , the center of power would be moved much closer to france , and without the franks as a powerhouse in western europe , there would be nobody to ignite the reconquest of those lands . 
  even with the whole might of the franks after the victory , it took decades to reconquer the southern coastal areas , in the alternative situation , the whole southern half of france is in total muslim rule . 
   was it ? 
  where do you get that from ? 
  historiography ? 
  it featured 20-40 000 soldiers of the caliphate against 20-30 000 men on the frankish side ( modern estimates , primary sources state both armies as much larger ) . 
  it was indeed one of the largest battles that caliphate ever fought . 
   spain and gaul lay at the periphery of the umayyad caliphate not the point . 
   and the raid into gaul had been independently organized by the emir of cordoba . 
  again , not a raid . 
  nothing about it even implies a raid . 
  its original purpose was to secure the northern conquests as count odo already defeated another army prior to that campaign . 
  the main purpose was to take out count odo out of action and conquer his portion of aquitaine , however , as count odo fled north to the franks , the army of the caliphate naturally followed him . 
  even if you argue that their intent was not to conquer the lands of the franks , you can not avoid the fact that they did want and did conquer the lands of aquitaine , therefore again , it was not a raid in any way shape or form . 
   the caliphs themselves were focused much more on enemies closer to home irrelevant to the point . 
  nobody is arguing that the caliph was there or that the entire might of the caliphate was there . 
   as far as i know the estimates for the size of the muslim forces at tours usualy range in the low ten thousands . 
  yeah , and that is indeed a massive army for the period . 
  muslims conquered persia with an army of 20 000 and egypt with 12 000 . 
  hell , the initial force that landed in visigoth spain was around 8000 . 
   on the other hand the siege of constantinople not the point . 
   i have a hard time believing that an engagement at the far side of the empire was larger in scale than campaigns organized by the central government in damascus . 
  i was not arguing that it was . 
  i said , one of the largest , not the largest . 
   actually , they would probably be happy about victory , raid some , go back , repeat sometime in the future . 
  actually , they would most likely conquer everything south of tours and then remain in france for a really , really long time . 
   the caliphate was extremely stretched as it was and had far better stuff to do . 
   `` great battle x that save whatever '' is akin to stuff like `` the fall of rome '' and `` the dark ages '' . 
  i am not arguing that they would conquer the whole of the continent , merely a good portion of france . 
  the carolingian period would not have happened , frankish empire would not have happened , it is even a real question on whether at all reconquista would happen in any serious way . 
  in essence , you would likely have a muslim southern france for centuries to come , at the least that is . 
   how would they possibly conquer france ? 
  northern iberia is very mountainous and difficult to control , france is not . 
  by the time tours happened , the caliphate already had half of southern france under their rule and would definitely conquer northwards if the battle was their victory . 
   it was a minor battle in farthest periphery of weakening empire . 
  it was one of the largest battles the umayyads fought , ever . 
  yes , that was the nature of warfare at the time , more complex than during the age of nation states . 
  in essence , after the duke of aquitaine broke his oath , charles was adamant in claiming the territory he saw as rightfully for his taking , which of course , required war and bloodshed . 
  they were pursuing count odo to consolidate an already successful conquest of southern aquitaine , to argue that it was a raid on any level is utter folly . 
   the consensus among historians is that he did n't stopped an invasion , he stopped a plundering raid no , that is not the consensus among historians , merely certain names who would like to downplay the event in face of it being constantly overstated by many . 
  to that base point ; raids do not constitute tens of thousands of soldiers and they do not conquer cities and land . 
  i mean , seriously . 
  nobody is arguing that early medieval europe was very nice ... 
   was n't al-andalus a really nice place to live though actually , no . 
  that is a myth resulting from 19th century and early 20th century historians romanticizing it . 
  it was equally violent with only the large urban city of cordoba being a more civilized beacon , until it too crumbled during the early taifa period . 
  in essence , apart from a few decades of stable rule throughout the centuries , muslim spain and north africa were rife with internal struggles and fightings equal to those in christian europe . 
  to illustrate this , the population of cordoba fell from 300 000 to just 30-40 000 in a span of just a few years during the taifa wars . 
  how much does the fact that prison sentences in most of europe are pathetic influence this ? 
  there were loads of colossus statues , reliefs and work done in europe during ancient times , it is just that basically none survive . 
  even the colossus of constantine only has the head and one hand surviving ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/colossus_of_constantine the now lost colossus of nero for example was nearly as tall as the statue of liberty . 
  show me what you got, 
  because it is no longer a celebration of multiculturalism or open society , but a purposeful and sinister desire to undermine the domestic identity and culture of a people . 
  it is one thing to allow people into your country because of altruism , it is a completely different thing to desire for them to come for your own ideological wet dreams . 
  his son is also quite the character , he helped christian ethiopia remain independent by launching a crusade with only 400 musket armed heavy infantry ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crist%c3%b3v%c3%a3o_da_gama he died fighting for ethiopia . 
  i do , which is why i already posted that video . 
  sci show video on him ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdee5uvfhom joe rogan summing it up ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlffltjtg9e,
