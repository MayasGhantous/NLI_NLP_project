  that is just a demonstrably wrong opinion , dude ( . _ . ), 
   how long can we play the `` hidden '' card for ? 
  until about 1971 , after that it will probably escalate into large scale tourism . 
   before it was croatia [ erm ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_republic_of_croatia ), 
   rightwing/leftwing crybabies please stop using that term . 
  it has become , weary . 
   so did the emperor try to have sex with his sister or did the chicken try to have sex with the emperor 's sister ? 
  likely neither . 
  it is very likely that this , just like most other outlandish tales about roman emperors , are falsehoods written by those that disliked them . 
  to my knowledge , magyars were finno ugric , not turkic . 
  i believe the sole reason so many people are pushing the turkic argument ( without any evidence ) is because they were very good horsemen . 
  it kinda does . 
  turks are at most 15-20 % related to anything in central asia , the western coastal populations go down to just 1-2 % , barely traceable . 
  similarly how bulgarians have only 1.5 % turkic lineage ( all combined , in total ) in their latest genetic study . 
  hmmm , that map has them far too east to my knowledge . 
  magyars were finno-ugric tribes from the area of modern day moscow . 
   even if they had 100.000 , that still wouldnt be enough to patrol every street in the city . 
  erm , it would be pretty easy for police to locate a goddamn anarchist black block and take it out lol . 
  hell , you need just one dude with a shotgun full of rubber bullets . 
   banning gendered words ? 
  i believe they only mean in legislature , laws and such . 
  this is not about those crazy us/canada based pronoun lunacies . 
  shhh , we are not supposed to talk about the territories . 
  why split though ? 
  thatcher in the rye . 
  [ apparently , the uk released a public statement as to the reasoning behind this . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p56zigx9pxw ), 
  the rus wiped out most of the turkic steppe tribes in the area during the late 10th century ; `` now not a trace is left of the bulgars , burthas and khozars in the steppes , because rus annihilated all of them , overran their lands and annexed them . '', 
   also , i think it 's a scientific fact that all croats are simply catholic serbs . 
  then serbs are orthodox croats . 
   we can then compare haplogroups and see the ratio of older to more modern combination compared to old samples . 
  yes , but that only tells us of migrations and population movement of the area in general , little about ethnicity . 
  but if croatia as a state was not yet mentioned by name by that point , how can you declare which one of them was the croatian state at the time ? 
  alright . 
  however , if we use dai as claim that croats settled only til around split , then we also have to accept that croats settled lower pannonia , making ljudevit and the `` savians '' croats as well . 
   and dalmatian croats who lived from gorski kotar and primorje to around split we have no idea how further south they lived . 
  we have a single primary source from the 10th century that is the sole reference for a period of 600 years of settlement . 
  but i am not even arguing against the coastal part , but the inland part . 
  the border being at sava and una is silly and nothing more but a re-draw of modern borders to inline the current bih .

  i look at you with suspicion . 
  there is none . 
  nobody is pure enough . 
  nearly a third of croatian men can trace their european lineage to the late neolithic lol , how the hell could you separate them from those who arrived here in the 7th century ad ? 
  i am not sure on what level of trolling you are right now . 
  it is not meaningless , as you say , modern turks are barely asiatic genetically and are essentially native anatolians mixed with various smaller traces of other groups ( including turkic obviously ) . 
  compare them for instance with the turkic ethnicities in central asia and you get a clear difference . 
  as the question was whether avars were turkic , it is not incorrect to point out that they were not as turkic as they were when they originally entered europe . 
  using haplogroups for ethnical identity is actually very flawed and not at all scientific . 
  by certain notions , the peoples of northern afganistan would be the most slavic of peoples . 
  when alexander sang us to sleep but now we 're stressed out ... 
  khazars yes , but avars were mixed by the time they got to pannonia . 
  they are last mentioned as being subjugated by croats in the early 10th century . 
  khazars were eventually genocided by the rus , while the remains of the avars were gradually absorbed by the franks and croats after they were destroyed in the early 9th century . 
  the western balkans part is following the post 18th century border of croatia for some reason .

  * dope days ... and no , the dope old days would be the alternative universe where germany won ww1 and nazi 's never came to be . 
   has it helped croatia for the better ? 
  yes , very much so . 
  it also hurt us somewhat as loads of people left the country . 
   ethnicity does indeed exist , just not in the sense that you seem to favor and advocate for . 
  it exists exactly in the sense that it is defined in and that is how i see it . 
   simple fact of the matter is that ` ethnic germans ' are n't a thing anymore since the 30 year war . 
  ridiculous statement . 
  serbia lost more male population in ww1 and their ethnic makeup barely changed because of it . 
  you seem to think that i am arguing for some silly set of pureness and bloodlines and instead you go to the other far end and argue nonsensical notions to counter something i was not even implying . 
   arguing otherwise requires a widening of the definition no , it really does not . 
   in which case the argument of ` germans being replaced ' becomes moot . 
  also a faulty statement , as firstly , those coming now are largely from populations that are both culturally and genetically far more distant from whichever populations intermigled in the territory of modern germany for the past thousands of years , and secondly , those people themselves often do not see themselves as germans . 
  i understand your line of thinking , and while it is paved with good intention , it is flawed , because the vast majority of the human species still has not made your step , people are mostly still tribal . 
   since ` ethnically ' german does n't really exist holy hell you are hilarious . 
  ethnicity does exist and is accepted as a societal reality by scientific circles . 
   unless you wish to quote ` aryanism ' tell me , how is the weather there , up your own ass ?
