   yeah just like they can trace their lines to outside of europe if looking at other branches but far , far , far less so . 
  i do not think you understand how population genetics work . 
  for instance , i myself very likely have exactly 0 % of any ties to africa ever since whichever of my ancestors last left that continent . 
   and people from north africa or the arab peninsula can often trace part of their lines to europe . 
  same thing , at an irrelevant margin . 
  about 66,422,000 of them in germany . 
  i believe you need to go and re-read the definition of fallacy . 
  ethnically german . 
   but the people that are now above 70 sure as hell do not directly descend from the ` germanic tribes ' ( nor has anyone in at least 500 years ) utterly false , in fact a lot of modern europeans can trace their european genetic line back towards 12-15 000 years ago , let alone the past 1000 years ... 
   no , no one is being replaced . 
  an utterly hilarious statement . 
  i imagine some imbecile among the romanized ilyrian tribes who lived in the balkans as the slavs started arriving arguing the same thing .

  which europeans lol ? 
  when ? 
  site a single source describing belgrade or thrace as outside europe in any context . 
  just out of curiosity , what noticeable legacy of any of those empires to we have today ? 
   europe can be further than constantinople , or even it may not even contain belgrade . 
  by which definition has either belgrade or eastern thrace ever not been in europe ? 
  [ what is the name of the continent that this city is depicted on ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/map_of_istanbul_early_19th_century.jpg ), 
  istanbul in the 19th century was nearly completely on the european side , it was only after ww1 that the city expanded into asia towards what it is today . 
  not to mention that the development of the piece mentions italy , london , prague etc. 
  in the description . 
   will be left to fight it ? 
  erm , the tens of thousands of professional soldiers currently employed by those countries ? 
  also , you can draft the unemployed . 
   just go to another eu country instead . 
  but other eu countries ports are way further away from libya than italy is , which would indeed damage the `` supply line '' quite seriously . 
  if one person owes apples , that does not mean the other does not owe oranges , despite the price difference . 
  i am not equating them though .

  holy hell that is incredible haha,

  the prayer part is terrifying . 
   i live on a farm now and work 12 + hours a day . 
  then you either have additional tasks/jobs or you are an incredibly shitty farmer . 
   there is no way it was better hundreds of years ago with even less labor-saving devices and machinery . 
  you do n't know what you 're talking about . 
  i am not saying it was better , i am merely saying that , when the entire year is leveled , the average farmer would work an average 5-6 hours per day . 
  there is just not enough stuff to do for you to rack up more , even without machinery . 
  [ i 'm not your guy , frieeend !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuqk6t2esng ), 
   we 'd have been farmhands working 12 hours in the field every day farmers did not work that much , even without machinery you work a couple to several hours a day averaged across the year at most , some weeks more , some weeks less . 
  the rest of your reply is sound ( though exaggerated for effect obviously ) , but i believe you fail to understand the purpose of their history loving . 
  the vast majority of them are fully aware of what you state and they do n't care , because that is not the point . 
  the point is that their minds are tied to either ethnicities or political entities which they see as living characters in a story and they feel like a part of that story tied to that character . 
  well , i mean , it is their ancestral homeland . 
  i would not think against black people in america treating africa with veneration either . 
  a lot of people are still very tribal and still yearn for various ethnic/racial notions to solidify themselves within some group identity , it just kinda happens .
