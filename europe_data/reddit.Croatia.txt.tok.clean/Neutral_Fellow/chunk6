   then it 's a million times worse well , i disagree . 
  you are underestimating the might of societal subversion through ideology . 
  truly a magnificent name for a mine , worthy of its rich history . 
  haha , at first i thought they forgot about croatia again and got pissed , then i remembered about the brits . 
   is there like a left wing info wars ? 
  there is , i believe it is called `` college '' . 
   i do n't know if it 's possible that way the reality is that most eastern europeans are still quite nationalistic and tribalistic and the same sentiment is rising in western europe as well . 
  meaning , it is only through ideological subversion that you can disband the ever growing anti-eu sentiment stop the secessionist eurosceptics . 
  by this you hijack nationalism from the right and bring it to at least the center if not even the left and once the right wing loses that sole platform they depend upon , they collapse . 
  ushering in a new eu . 
   but i sure as hell wo n't help promote the identity politics that the nationalist shit will create if successful , the civic nationalism spawned will be purely a political ideology , not a racial or ethnical one . 
  that is at least what i hope can be achieved . 
   it still strives for a mainly nationalistic europe which is just calling for trouble if you want the eu to unite , you need nationalism . 
  if you think you can do it with `` hur dur we are all brothers and sisters of earth kumbaya neo kumbaya '' bullshit then you should probably get your head out of the sand . 
  when was banovina of croatia reinstated ? 
  how long was i out ? 
  one is the slavic symbol for the gifting god , the other is a heraldic cross potent . 
   what 's the point of choosing some rando symbol that no one knows lol that is exactly what they did with those boring ass 12 stars . 
   those symbols look too swatsticka - like ... what ? 
  are one is a slavic symbol for the gift god and the other is the cross potent . 
  are all straight lined symbols now off limits lol ? 
   personally i like the current flag well , to each his own . 
  i love the eu , but the flag is pure meh . 
   if you need a catching slogan or an artistic flag to draw people towards you , maybe your arguments are not that strong and appealing . 
  but if you have both good arguments ** and ** good propaganda/imagery , than it becomes double trouble . 
  it is no secret that the eu is in desperate need of a pr overhaul . 
  dear god , both the eu and everyone connected to it are truly horrible at propaganda . 
  the current eu flag is the mehiest meh ever , that green thing is even worse . 
  you need a symbol that is actually imposing and drives an emotional reaction .

  `` should have waited a decade before invading russia . '', 
  huh , wikipedia states that bogoris is iranian in origin ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boris_ ( given_name ), 
   a system that is already working ? 
  haha , nice one . 
   they have to ** pay more ** then just ** giving them money **  your comment makes no sense . 
  yeah , mine does n't ... 
  do international courts have snelrecht ? 
  i say no . 
  the main reason modern turkey has its current borders is the turkish army and ataturk winning the turkish independence war . 
  to imagine istanbul being a city state throughout the 20th century ... 
  suddenly ataturk, 
  erm , no it is not . 
  i thought the `` everything comes from turkic hur dur turan '' internet wave has been put to sleep already . 
  [ inb4 crimea 2024 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cighcovzqtk ), 
  no , pol just stole it from the internet in general , from youtube to facebook comments you could find it anywhere , it was just mocking the way leftist are running out of positive adjectives to describe multicultural areas without offending anyone . 
  well , it you could just rename it into closed asylum detention facilities or do any other of the wide variety of legal whishwash to try and pull it out . 
  it would take years for the legal stuff to be resolved and by that time most people would already be gone . 
   still a fucking stupid idea . 
  no , just an uncomfortable one . 
   you would have to enforce it to make your `` psychological '' effect work well , yeah . 
   even the cost of putting the first few in prison would be higher than the current solution . 
  somehow , i doubt that very much . 
  why would a government be sued for implementing its own law ? 
  you mistake my intent . 
  it is not about imprisoning them , it is about 99 % of them not wanting to go to jail and thus leaving the country by their own decision . 
  ideally of course . 
  no , because rarely anyone wants to go to prison . 
  those should be a rather low number . 
  just paint the eu flag over that breastplate and you have a far better captain europe right there . 
  just make being illegal in the country illegal and punish it with 10-15 years in prison . 
  the country will empty itself within months . 
   in him they see a figure who might do away with turkish nationalism [ ugh , ] ( https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1380298503ra/684784.gif ) talk about putting all your eggs in a shitty basket . 
  giving a hyperactive , aggressive balkan man a personal flying arsenal of doom ... [ what ever could go wrong ?

  enforce borders and this will not happen . 
  yes , if she brought some cavalry with her to stockholm she can activate the krabater !, 
  alright , i will post it there as well , 
  not sure if you got it , but it is an album of pictures , not just one picture . 
  i forgot to tag the photos when i was making the gallery and when i realized it , it was too late and it refused to update the tags when i tried to put the names in . 
  my bad . 
  it is a historical fact that they may have been turkic before they even entered eastern europe proper . 
  the bulgars that were in ukraine were already completely separate from the turkic tribes . 
  in fact , the first bulgar tsar did not have a turkic name but an iranian one , so current historiography is not even so sure whether or not even the old bulgars were turkic or did they just had a turkic name identifier because they lived among them for some time . 
  usually it is a result of a smaller settlement/fortification expanding , the older walls remain while a new one is built . 
  other times it is for the purpose of a better defense , as you can attack and pelt the enemy with missiles while they try to climb or destroy the outer fence , which slows them down quite a bit . 
  everything early medieval , from the 5th to the end of the 10th century . 
  i should have perhaps put early medieval in the title ... 
   the bulgars that founded the first empire were a turkic people .

  erm yes , finland was part of the russian empire despite being a duchy . 
  hell , croatia and hungary were ** kingdoms ** and still became nothing but title lands within the austrian empire . 
  i agree with you but for a different reason . 
  firstly , the name is basically unpronounceable to anyone outside the balkans . 
  secondly , he is directly responsible for the crime ridden privatization shamble of the 90s .
