  or you completely missed the words i wrote and are utterly unable to read things without automatically assuming that whatever you read that does not sit well with your mind is automatically someones lucid dream of authoritarianism . 
  holy hell people . 
  incredible . 
   if because people do n't care for them . 
  yeah , and i call bullshit on that one . 
  it is just that politics switched to spewing opportunistic hyenas as of late . 
  if people do not care about pricks , then how the hell did pricks like farage and boris ( current foreign secretary ) get so much influence and power ? 
   talking about silly sidelining and than invoking staling sounds a bit ... silly ? 
  no , because you twice connected the mere notion of a person being/appearing strong as a politician to dictators . 
  ... what ? 
   some are more interested in their ideas and plans for the economy and for the country than how macho the leader is yeah , i am not excluding those as being important . 
  are you seriously unable to realize that one does not supplant the other ? 
   not everyone worship putin-like politicians . 
  lol , and again with the silly sidelining . 
  anyone not a kinder garden teacher in a suit is apparently stalin . 
   those are n't the qualities people are looking for the common people are n't looking for strong and firm persons as leaders ? 
  sure thing buddy . 
  people literally cried when stalin died . 
   who try to show that they are manly and strong leaders i am not talking about those who purposefully show of that they are `` manly '' and strong , i am talking about those who were or are `` manly '' and strong , at least in their activities and appearance as servants of the state . 
   ( also known as dictators wan na bes ) . 
  i find it comical how mere expressiveness of stature , opinion and decision making is somehow tied to charismatic despotism in your mind . 
   quoting three politicians again , not the same as a president or prime minister or another head of a government . 
  oh , i missed a beat while reading responses , my bad . 
  yeah , because having such an opinion is obviously impossible for a rational person to have right ? 
   said prime minister charles michel today on the rtbf, 
  well , imo , it is just wrong for a political entity to be able to execute people outside wartime . 
  the worse one could argue for is forced labor camps , but then again , just prolonging the sentences would be a good start . 
  i am aware , but a government having a stance is quite different from a prime minister issuing a public statement such as this . 
  thank you . 
  thatcher was a badass . 
  i disagree with a good portion of her domestic policies , but at least she was an actual statesman instead of a worm in a suit we usually suffer nowadays . 
  [ maaay the builder ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgrvxqbej0m ), 
  wait , a western european politician with measurable testosterone levels ? 
  we have n't seen that since margaret thatcher left office . 
  ... and so it begins . 
   you are part of eu for how many months ? 
  we have been in the eu for years . 
   and already bitching like if you are major part for decades that is irrelevant to his point , your counter arguing of him just because he is from croatia is utterly moot . 
   nobody 's going to croatia anyway do n't worry they send people here but they just keep returning to germany , got ta cash in those euro 's bruh . 
  you wrongly assume that they care about europe or europeans . 
  every day is naked gardening day if you life remote enough . 
  alternatively , [ in 30 years ... ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xveyctyj1do&amp;t=0m32s ), 
   it will reach its limit eventually it will be too late by then . 
  two words ; lefty altruism, 
  well , yeah . 
   european russia is still pretty cold though pretty hot from late spring to early fall though . 
  i said `` from moldavia to siberia '' , meaning the land in between . 
  you do realize moscow is one of the largest cities on earth and is located in an area more inhospitable than any flatland south of it ? 
  we are talking about millions of square km . 
  [ straight up cash bru . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzgndtbzkdy ), 
  there 's plenty of vacant space from moldavia to siberia . 
  two words : mass exodus,

  the penalty for apostasy in islam is death . 
  brainwashed sillies , both of them . 
  no , it is ; right wing extremist : no to immigration , keep the countries as homogeneous as possible left wing extremist : i can not comprehend human nature and i assault anyone that is not left wing enough for me, 
  because antifa are usually utter scum . 
  no , it is one of the usual right wing blogs . 
  you ca n't just keep calling everything alt-right lol . 
   do croatian-americans have any sort of legal recognition or minority status in america ? 
  no , because there is to few of them compared to the total population . 
   i do n't see your point . 
  my point is merely that they have a right to declare themselves finns if they wish it . 
   he 's not croatian lol dude , both his parents are croatian and he declares himself as croatian . 
  ethnicity does not die with nationality , who you are is more than just a piece of some flimsy paper and a signature , despite what globalists would like you to believe .

  is [ this man ] ( https://www.mma-core.com/images/images/original/118555.jpg ) not a croat just because he speaks english instead of croatian ? 
  you lakepeople are truly a magnificent tribe . 
  the greek does not appreciate you .

  [ uberboat arrives to croatia ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/business/18665-uberboat-arrives-in-croatia ) and could become a major thing considering we have 1100 + islands . 
  it is like they are actively trying to make their country look as bleak as possible . 
  nevah . 
  my loyalty lies with esa . 
  we shall reign supreme the moment i finish my verne cannon conc ... i have said too much . 
   not from your phone on a balloon with rocket boosters . 
  not my fault the coordinates matched and the phone took the image from the exact point line as the satellite . 
   but can you prove it i already provided the image . 
  as i said . 
  tiny , little , rocket boosters . 
  that is some serious fire hazard . 
   a balloon would burst before it left the atmosphere it had tiny little rocket boosters . 
   therefore the image is not taken from space false , the accepted border of space is the karman line , which is only 100km of altitude ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k%c3%a1rm%c3%a1n_line, 
  i think he means they do it in sneak mode and wing it . 
   the crusades were not in any way `` defensive wars '' technically , the first one was , initially , until the conquered antioch that is . 
  i taped my phone to a balloon . 
  [ here you go . 
  yes .
