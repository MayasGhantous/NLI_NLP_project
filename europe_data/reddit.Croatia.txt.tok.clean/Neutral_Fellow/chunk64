   `` striving to make residents of a country all share one ( mono - ! ), 
  culture '' . 
  mostly . 
   but having a dominant culture does not yet mean a country is monocultural . 
  well , it does mean that if said dominant culture dominates society and societal discussions in a country . 
  obviously , at some point it stops being so , but that depends on how much the dominant culture surrenders ground . 
   where all its inhabitants shared one single culture or identity now you are stretching it on purpose . 
  the meaning is tied to a population being a significant majority and having a single culture or identity that is societally dominant , some small minorities in the corner do not sideline this . 
   it has always been to one degree or another a mix of cultures -- slovene , german , italian , croatian , jewish , hungarian , roma , etc. 
  dude , what ? 
  i am not speaking of cultural isolation , what you described here is what makes up slovene culture and identity and does not refute the point , it is still monocultural in the sense of the slovene culture being basically the only existent one in the country . 
   yet seem have such a strong dislike for multicultural states i do n't , they are an viable option for a society to form over . 
  my rebuttal is tied to your post denying monoculturalism and ethnic homogeneity as viable/possible , i am responding to your statement . 
   and to me india is the prime example of a multicultural state yes , and civic nationalism is the sole thing that formed it , kept it from falling apart and keeps it together to this day . 
   yeah because it 's good for you narrative no , i just took the first useful link that google gave me . 
  good point though . 
  here is a short video about it , with more information ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cc9clmgxp_a, 
  [ whelp ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exnay0l4xsm ), 
  [ whoa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwihnbmupdi ), 
  huh . 
   and in research given that 6 years is n't even a decade . 
  that is where you are wrong , portuguese gdp dropped in 2014 ( 230 billion ) and kept doing so [ until now ( 190 billion ) . 
  ] ( http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=33&amp;pr.y=5&amp;sy=2017&amp;ey=2017&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=182&amp;s=ngdp%2cngdpd%2cngdppc%2cngdpdpc%2cpppgdp%2cppppc%2clur%2clp%2cggxwdg%2cggxwdg_ngdp&amp;grp=0&amp;a= )  feel free to put it in it 's own category as an underveveloped stagnated country it already is there . 
  alright . 
   and decades means more than one yeah , that was a wording mess up on my part . 
   if you are looking for stereotypes feel free to include croatia also in that list given it 's performance during those years . 
  i included croatia in the primary `` worse '' list ... 
  spanish , greek and portuguese gdp 's have been in a horrendous ** decrease ** since 2008 , that is 9 years now , almost a decade . 
  well yeah . 
  imo , a good economy and 50 % higher wages would turn croatia into paradise on earth . 
  to those wondering why the eu happiness is just 6.7 ; croatia , hungary , romania and bulgaria are less developed and spain , portugal , greece and italy are in a decades long stagnation with no end in sight . 
   what if one country attacks russia then the alliance article of nato does not apply , aggressors are not to be assisted . 
  they would have to assassinate their own president first .

  ... it 's not summer yet . 
   it is alt right to push conspiracies linking ngo with human trafficking with no proofs whatsoever . 
  conspiracies are alt-right now ? 
  dude , the last few soros posts here were basically 99 % people bashing and laughing at the few of us who hate the guy . 
  even in the previous ngo threads the comments were mostly just criticisms and discussion of the migration route as a whole . 
  accusing r/europe of alt-rightyness is ridiculous . 
   this sub is more alt right than / r/the _ donald when it comes to non eu immigration . 
  such a ridiculous statement i wonder if you are even being sincere . 
  imo , white people adopt black children mostly because of virtue signalling . 
  they want everyone around them to know that they are such good people that adopted a child , but if they adopt a white kid , how will everyone know that it is adopted and how utterly awesome they are for doing so ? 
  thousands of european children across the continent weeping for a family and they choose this , ridiculous . 
  yugoslavia was at the head of the non-aligned movement and had decades of good relations and exchange with african nations . 
  as for croatia , we get a lot of black tourists , mostly women , so we basically only experience the good aspects of multiculturalism while never having to deal with societal issues of actually living in a multi cultural country . 
  i believe that the only people balkan nations are somewhat xenophobic about are arabs and gypsies . 
  i hurt myself , today ... 
  jesus for a second i thought the jacket was a little kid . 
  inspired by [ sir archibald mapsalot iii ] ( http://www.cc.com/video-clips/kovgs5/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-sir-archibald-mapsalot-iii ), 
   that graph tells nothing though . 
  it really does though . 
   it should show more regions that eu and non-eu . 
  perhaps . 
   non-eu is still alot of european countries . 
  still the same argument . 
  open borders is open borders . 
   also in norway the largest unemployed ration is for africans ( specifically somalia and neighbours ) ( we dont have many mena migrants , yet ) yes , and in the netherlands for example the largest unemployment bracket filling is also africans , some ethnicities achieving 70 % unemployment . 
  again , still the same argument . 
  open borders is an utterly sinister concept conceived by the western ruling class to create a divided and politically docile society . 
  mimic that [ 27 % migrant unemployment rate ] ( http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/55f1be979dd7cc24008b96a3-800-600/screen%20shot%202015-09-10%20at%201.31.33%20pm.png ) bruh, 
  perhaps , or perhaps donald desired it since it created weeks of news cycles and tens of millions in free advertising for him and his campaign . 
  degrees are not accomplishments by themselves , they are merely stepping stones towards achieving something . 
  you can have a doctorate in engineering and work as a horse shoe maker in some village if your life results so . 
   such as influencing pro-lgbt policies , plus trying to make children less morbidly obese . 
  as vague as possible and without palpable results . 
   the us has done well as a country with diverse population . 
  doing well does not exclude doing better . 
  the usa would be more successful if the population was more homogenous . 
  not to mention that `` done well '' was basically one group treating everyone else like shit until fairly recently . 
  diversity is inherent weakness that requires constant societal discussion and sociology merely to minimize its corrosiveness . 
   she is actually quite accomplished in her own right ... how ? 
  ( apart from being the first lady ofc ), 
  that is ... bizarre . 
  why green though ? 
  well , considering most of the german population straight up hates anything related to war , military or just plain marching in ranks , i am not surprised that a certain form of ideological funneling happened among the ranks . 
  this is quite suspicious after that melania did the same . 
  considering that trump has been [ accused of purposefully creating scandals on himself in order to create news cycles ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-7x0zemt7e&amp;t=3m50s ) , this could very well be some purposeful mindfuckery on the populace created by publicity experts . 
  it was pretty blatant mockery yes . 
  i believe you mistook the intent and meaning of my post . 
  that it has a rump state attached to it called transnistria which is very different from our istria . 
  diversity is strength . 
  tribalism is a fairy tale . 
  please , for the love of christ , invade and make us into a federal state . 
  no , those are regular bullets . 
  though , imo , police should indeed have direct rule to shoot anyone holding molotovs with live ammo , on sight . 
  an excellent location for a duel . 
  croatia would send [ stipe miocic ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zajlkwpeojq/maxresdefault.jpg ) , have fun with that .

  well , apparently , the shamen did . 
   germany actually seems to be doing quite well right now economically if you want to talk about jobs . 
  doing well does not exclude the possibility of doing better .
