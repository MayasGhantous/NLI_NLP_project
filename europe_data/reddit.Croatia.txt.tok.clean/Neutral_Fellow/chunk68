  every summer there is an austrian exodus southwards where they exchange bodily fluids with croatians on the beaches and then they go back north to their homes , leaving some cash behind so croatia does not collapse . 
   but black people are killed by the police every day black men also commit over 50 % of violent crime despite being just 6 % of the population . 
  also , a police officer is 12 times more likely to be killed by a black man than vice versa . 
   or go to prison for possessing small amounts of drugs now that is fucked up yes . 
   cuba has 99 % literacy and free healthcare . 
  that 's better than the us . 
  no it is not , because the us still has a far higher living standard . 
   all this while the country has been under sanctions since the revolution . 
  that is a good point yes , but it does not take away from the statement that cuba is doing alright . 
   did you know that cuba sends more doctors for international aid than any other country ? 
  yes , because that is what happens when you have extra work force in a planned economy . 
   how about actually responding to what i said ? 
  what is there to say ? 
  you stated that a one party authoritarian regime with a gdp per capita smaller than gabon is `` doing ok '' . 
   it 's easy to focus on those who die but not on those who are saved by the progress it creates . 
  holy christ that is a hilarious sentence . 
  even if the second part was in any way based in reality , it would still be incredible , but the fact that the ones that survived also still remained in a communist hellhole for decades makes it just ... so much juicier . 
   child mortality dropped massively , death rates came down a lot , education levels soared , women 's rights were protected , healthcare became available to all for free . 
  on paper it sounds great , in reality nothing of it was effectively done and tens of millions died for it ffs . 
   it 's true that china would n't have become the country with the highest gdp ppp under it 's communist ways of old , but it 's also true that if it had continued as the mostly farming peasant nation it was in the 1950s many more people would have died from disease , malnutrition , famine , or other curable illnesses they got treatment for for free or you know , they could have left their peasant fields through capitalism instead , under the nationalists , and became today 's china by the 1970s . 
   you 're right , i 'm not arguing facts with you that china is poorer than it was in 1980 . 
  ... what ? 
   even if you only think that capitalism is the best way forward for china and do n't care for the social side , which i 'm sure many do , it would n't have been possible without the radical change from 1950 to 1980 i disagree , as the other side fled to the peasant forest of taiwan and tried to do the same without communism , the results are clear , they had 5 times the gdp per capita by 1980 ; http://i.imgur.com/ocs7vkb.png, 
   cuba is doing fine though oh boy ...  china did massive progress from 1950 to 1980 i am sure that humongous mountain of corpses would like to have a word with you . 
  also , basically all of current china 's might was achieved from 1990 onwards , not during actual communist period . 
  they had an economy smaller than russia during the 90s , which is something really special .

  [ sure thing buddy . 
  the thing is that the referendum was close . 
  i am not saying that the refugee crisis caused some political shift , merely that it helped push that extra 1 % to tip the referendum . 
  without the crisis , it is surely possible that the referendum would fail , and after that you would have at least 4-8 years of britain still in the eu . 
  not really , if the referendum failed , the uk would have at least a couple more years for a cool off , years that could have effectively ended brexit .

   bill gates for example . 
  the massive difference is that bill gates did not rack up cash by currency manipulation and playing jo-jo with fragile third world economies during the 80s and 90s . 
   antep what is so horrible about it ? 
  it also basically pushed up brexit . 
  good job . 
   it is not human trafficking if they bring the asylum seekers to the right authorities , which they do . 
  actually , it is trafficking , since they pick them up in libyan waters , not italian . 
  technically , they should be shipping them to the nearest safe port , about 15-20 of nearest which are in tunisia , not italy . 
   of course it is always soros with you guys because it nearly always actually is soros when it comes to ngo 's and stuff . 
  you can absolutely argue that the right wing goes sideways constantly with the `` one man illuminati machine '' thing , but that does not mean that soros is not a sinister figure in the story .

   kievan rus ' ( precursor to belarus , ukraine and russia ) was founded by swedish vikings . 
  it was founded by an alliance of slavs and swedes , not just swedish vikings . 
  here is the earliest account of how the rus looked like when assembled ; `` leaving igor in kiev , oleg attacked the greeks . 
  he took with him a multitude of varangians , chuds , krivichians , merians , polianians , severians , derevlians , radimichians , croats , dulebians , and tivercians , who are tors . 
  all these tribes are known as great scythia by the greeks . 
  with this entire force , oleg sallied forth by horse and by ship , and the number of his vessels was two thousand . '',

  the executions were done inland on a hill ... 
  must be interesting stuff for a country to have actual coups recent in its history . 
  this is what happened after the city and the fortress surrendered : `` when ** all the turks ** had ** left the city ** , the christians , on the orders of the two kings , opened the gates and freely entered the city , joyfully dancing and exulting at the top of their voices . 
  they glorified the lord and gave thanks , for god had showed his great mercy to them and he had visited and worked redemption for his people . 
  the banners and manifold flags of the kings were run up atop the walls and towers . 
  the city was equally divided by the two kings . 
  they also made a proportionally equal distribution of the supplies of arms and of food . 
  the captives of the highest degree of nobility were divided between them by lot . 
  the king of france , moreover , for his part had the noble palace of the templars with all its appurtenances . 
  king richard got the royal palace , to which he sent his queens with the children and their servants . 
  thus each of the kings peacefully secured his position . 
  the army was housed throughout the city . 
  after the prolonged daybyday agonies of the siege , they now quietly refreshed themselves in much desired peace . 
  on the night following our entry , saladin and his army , out of fear of our people , left the place where they had camped and occupied a mountain further away . '', 
  - itinerarium peregrinorum et gesta regis ricardi this is basically the theme across all sources , the muslim population was allowed to leave apart from the muslim military officers , nobles and likely soldiers . 
  then it all went haywire as the negotiations were prolonged and it turned into some bizarre show of brutality , where christians executed the muslim prisoners on one hill while muslims executed their own christian prisoners on another hill in retaliation . 
   king lionheart had 3,000 muslim ( including all women and children ) prisoners executed that is actually just a myth , both contemporary muslim and christian chroniclers state that it was a military garrison who was slaughtered , as the civilians were let go out of the city and given to saladins army by richard the same day they ( re ) took acre . 
  also , the slaughter was kinda necessary , richard was under siege and neither could he feed those men and neither was it a good idea to have thousands of muslim soldiers within your walls as other muslims besieged you outside . 
  the issue was that both richard and saladin messed up the ransom exchange deal , the one asked for too much and the other tried to buy time and further the siege . 
  he was born there actually and lived there until he was 9 . 
   pretty sad that frederick barbarossa drowned well , you never know lol . 
  though , muslim chronicler al-athir states that he is sure that the whole of levant and egypt would be christian if that army did not disband as it did , that is how much of a threat ze german juggernaut was , especially after they roflstomped the empire and the seljuk sultanate on their way there . 
   the third crusade kinda failed well , just kinda , they did recapture basically all major cities and coastal land apart from jerusalem and the surroundings . 
   people like me who realize that property is theft tell me , how is the weather like there , up your own ass ? 
   sure , `` competent '' . 
  in having friends in right places . 
  competent as in murdering a lot of middle men , lawyers and witnesses and just being very brutal criminals . 
   well , great progressiveness would be necessary , it 's just mathematics at that point . 
  alright . 
   that happened in many countries but only russia ended up with such a narrow caste of millionaires because only in russia were the top blokes competent enough to pull it off . 
   also , proper progressive taxation would erase that difference i doubt that very much , the difference is far too great . 
   that 's a false analogy . 
  alright . 
  that is true , but by very rich i meant your flaunty neighbor with a good job making 200/300 + k euro , not the suit overlords . 
  guess i misplaced the meaning of the wording there . 
   the rationale behind progressive taxation is that when you happen to have more money your returns are higher .
