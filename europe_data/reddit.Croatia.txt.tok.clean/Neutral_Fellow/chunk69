  true . 
   if you are taxated on the same level as poorer person that leads to wealth concentration but it also leads to people having a higher incentive to make more and spend more . 
  wealth concentration is inevitable . 
   like glorious oligarchy of russia where you have flat tax rate that has very little to do with their tax rates and far more to do with the entire economy of russia being sold for pennies on dollars in the 90s . 
   also , as i said , if society agrees to it then it 's not theft . 
  if society agrees on the death penalty , is it then not murder ? 
  well , to people like me who argue that taxes should be as close to a flat tax as possible , yes , yes it is theft . 
  a man making double the salary will already pay higher taxes even if the taxing percentage is the same as that of a man making half his salary , there is no need to tax people more on top of that . 
  also , i always thought that french taxes were higher on the upper end , i did not know it was capped at 40ish % , my bad . 
  well yes but , when you are dealing with sections of historiography that do not include peoples who had writing , you are kinda forced to welcome whatever you can get . 
   it simply demands that the very richest section of the population provide a bit more solidarity . 
  are n't taxes for the very rich in france already basically theft ? 
   what should the european countries have done different integrating europe so as to avoid such massive eurosceptic movements we see today ? 
  a very strict and brutally implemented illegal immigration control . 
  pan-european identitarianism/nationalism and civic propaganda . 
  that 's pretty much it . 
   did germanic pagans ever build temples ? 
  no , according to tacitus ; `` the germans do not think it in keeping with the divine majesty to confine gods within walls or to portray them in the likeness of any human countenance . 
  their holy places are woods and groves , and they apply the names of deities to that hidden presence which is seen only by the eye of reverence . '', 
  ... and also yes according to ... tacitus ; `` everything , sacred or profane , the temple of tamfana , as they called it , the special resort of all those tribes , was leveled to the ground . '', 
   the anti-christian agenda pushing became a bit hard to digest . 
  i do not see it as such , it is merely a timeline when pagans had the upper hand , the second season has a reverse setting where alfred is becoming more powerful and the christians have an equal footing . 
  i recommend giving it a try . 
  vikings is not that good anymore , the script writing became straight up imbecilic . 
  the last kingdom is a far superior show now , especially the second season . 
  i still have no idea wtf you are talking about . 
  what picture ? 
  what turks ? 
  you are offended by the thumbnail image ? 
  is that it ? 
   charles martel rampaged the south west and the south east of france for decades ... 
  yes , he campaigned ( not decades though lol ) southwards and took land and cities after odo broke his oath of fielty . 
  however , he also campaigned against muslim cities and lands in south france still under muslim control , so i still do not see how your point is `` that 's for sure '' . 
   maybe you shall open a history book before writing ridiculously pedantic comment . 
  maybe you should refrain yourself from making simplistic hyperboles , that way , when someone sees your statement as faulty , you will not have to steep to the level of just being patronizing without actually stating anything in your reply . 
  well , that was pretty neat . 
  ... what ? 
   he killed probably not , warfare was small scale at the time , and tours was his largest battle , i doubt he ever managed to amount enough christian corpses to surpass the muslim corpses . 
   raped , tortured and starved a single source describing him doing so ? 
  because `` hur dur feudal lords raped and pillaged everything around them '' is more meme than history . 
  gee , who should i declare as great , a sith lord that took over the galaxy and ruled as emperor , or some weird looking green dude forced in exile that spent the remaining years of his life on planet swamp ass ? 
   combination of superhuman tactical insight and sheer luck having the worlds greatest military in terms of equipment , training and experience at the time also probably helped a lot   also probably the only european conqueror to ever reach all the way to india before we went there by boat in the 16th century . 
  the greeks that alexander left in bactria formed their own kingdom after alexander died and they invaded india again and allegedly marched all the way to pataliputra in eastern india and ruled modern day pakistan for centuries . 
   and many in spain ignore that cid is an arab word do they ? 
  because , to my knowledge , it is widely known that el cid is merely a nickname the moors called him by . 
  the majority of french voters are pro-eu though . 
   arabs practically invented optics . 
  yes , optics in general , but not glasses . 
  corrective lenses were invented in europe . 
   try again . 
  a water clock is not a mechanical clock . 
  the first known actual example of it is from europe . 
   really ? 
  you 're going after pots and pans ? 
  pots and pans are n't glassware . 
   despite all evidence you 're staying willfully ignorant . 
  that 's is very much barbaric behavior . 
  not good !, 
  there is no evidence lol , i never even denied muslim and arab influence in getting europe back on track after the downfall of roman civilization in the west , the issue was merely your idiotic notion that it was the ottomans . 
   you took the bait and here we are . 
  you could not wait to show the world how smart you are . 
  so this is all trolling ? 
   that 's persuasive enough . 
  thank you . 
  k.  ridiculous . 
  not so , the texts you are speaking off originate from learning centers of the umayyad and abbasid caliphates , not the ottomans . 
   so what ? 
  i provided you with yeah , still nothing to do with ottomans . 
   dear lord , out of all people he picks dante as staple of european enlightenment . 
  i did n't though . 
   as i mentioned earlier , europe was barbaric hell hole before and long after dante died . 
  ridiculous statement . 
  spectacles , mechanical clocks , clear glass blowing etc. 
   you mentioned ottomans first yeah , because you called turkey as your medieval deliverer lol . 
   what makes you thing i was n't talking about byzantine empire ? 
  because i can read . 
  here is an alternative , longer and narrated 3d reconstruction video ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_phjb19zeg, 
   a pan-european , pro-eu right would be a force to be reckoned with . 
  exactly my thoughts . 
  if some weird form of liberal nationalist/identitarian political party is formed , they would rock the entire continent . 
  the tragedy for us bit on the right scale is that basically all right wing parties are led by pricks and plonkers or just down right imbeciles . 
  technically , carthage just moved sideways a bit , it was still called carthage after the third punic war and , as a roman city , it flourished into a massive city . 
  they would be so much more popular if they only dropped the anti-eu dogma . 
  i will look into this , thx . 
   last year the russian army decided to refurbish 3000 t-80s source ? 
   t-14 is a prototype , far away from mass production with only a handful of them built . 
  erm , they entered serial production months ago , the question is merely how many are being produced . 
  it is a finished weapon and a major problem for us . 
   even in the absolutely worst case scenario where russia managed to produce large quantities of t-14 while we did nothing in the meantime , we could still match them toe-to-toe . 
  that is true . 
  [ oyeeee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7smd6w0qhyk ), 
  it would hurt the eu though and would not solve the problem of uncontrolled illegal migration . 
  what is bad for the eu is ineluctably bad for croatia . 
  hmm , here are a few i could think off ; [ duke ljudevit ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ljudevit ) [ petar sva\u010di\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_sva%c4%8di%c4%87 ) [ nikola juri\u0161i\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_juri%c5%a1i%c4%87 ) [ petar berislavi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_berislavi%c4%87 ) [ petar kru\u017ei\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/petar_kru%c5%bei%c4%87 ) [ nikola zrinski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_%c5%a0ubi%c4%87_zrinski ) [ matija gubec ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matija_gubec ), 
   explain how exactly . 
  his funding and obsession with organizations bent on importing illegal migrants to europe is causing a rebound effect in eu politics and the rise of populism , nationalism , isolationism and euroscepticism on the continent . 
  i wo n't even go into all the financial scummery he was involved in over the decades . 
  give us 40ish billion euro 's and send them our way . 
  though , it would not work if you send them to a eu country , for the obvious reasons of that said country being unable to prevent them from leaving and going back to germany/sweden ( as they actually did and do when sent east ) . 
  money .
