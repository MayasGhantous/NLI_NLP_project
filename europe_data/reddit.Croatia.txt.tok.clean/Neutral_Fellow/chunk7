  it should be named after some croatian king or duke or something . 
  `` mislav airport '' for example . 
   after \u00d6gedei 's death , the mongols were plagued with poor leaders though . 
  this is true , but he would die eventually , subotai and batu would die , and the mongols would return to the tradition of simpleton alcoholics at the head of their hordes sooner or later . 
   the reason they turned back in 1241 was for the election of a khan . 
  well , they came back decades later and lost , because the hungarians were prepared that time . 
   they had n't lost any battles during their first central european campaign . 
  this is true , but they fought factions that were pathetic compared to the roman empire even at its weakest . 
  only the western and southern coastal anatolia was under roman control or rule during the republic . 
  it would seem that you are right about the southern levant though . 
   assuming the mongols arose in our alternate timeline , they would have easily destroyed the roman empire ( assuming no untimely khan death back in mongolia ) dude , they historically returned the second time under nogai khan and failed to even [ conquer hungary ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second_mongol_invasion_of_hungary ) ... not to mention that if rome survived , their military would be far more developed by the 13th century . 
  for instance , han china wiped the floor with the steppe armies because of their focus on crossbows , a similar thing could have happened to the roman military , and combined with the scutum , that means nothing but a pile of mongol corpses wherever they would meet . 
  well , yugoslavia did lose regardless , and that is what matters . 
  most of anatolia , armenia , southern levant and north west africa as well . 
  the independence gained in 2008 is a direct causation of that war . 
  a lot of people did not believe that kosovo will gain independence , also , a lot of people thought kosovars will lose the kosovo war . 
  stuff happens . 
   kosovo dude ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_war as for montenegro , they are kindred ethnicities and serbia was a rump state at the time . 
  the roman republic was 1,950,000 km \u00b2 at its largest while the roman empire was 5,000,000 km \u00b2 at its largest . 
  well , that is some weird stuff . 
  i will look into it . 
  ... what ? 
  source ? 
  `` diversity is our strength . '', 
  - some random roman dude , 4th century, 
   europe could have very well ended like china . 
  i disagree of that being a possibility . 
  the very nature of the roman mindset was expansion and power projection , there is no way in hell the romans would close themselves in like the chinese did . 
  imo , if the empire somehow survived it would have continued expanding everywhere , perhaps even travelling across the atlantic . 
  there is no eu without germany . 
  slavs were in eastern europe at the time . 
  hungarians were in eastern europe at the time . 
  most of us said similar things about kosovo until it happened . 
   they not consider the context of any given action ? 
  you are not talking about the context of an action , but a persons previous behavior and statements separate from what he is being accused of . 
   it is not a huge leap of logic so me saying that chicago is the crime capital of the us is defamation against black people ? 
  gobelki tepe is not a building . 
   other than looking at we will look at all that stuff , but the court can not ( or at least should not ) . 
   it is n't great to live in context-free land because unless literally everyone spells out precisely what they mean in good faith , the literal law enforcement are powerless to do anything . 
  yes , but you still can not legally hunt someone on the basis what he did separate from the supposed crime you are judging him/her for . 
  they will have no choice . 
  that is a violation of free speech as well . 
   second , the concept of intention is absolutely admissible in law  but thankfully the courts have more than two braincells to rub together and hence can prove intent pretty easily . 
  it is utterly impossible to legitimately prove intent in the sentence he spoke . 
  true , but you should not be able to prosecute people on ** implied ** intention , that is a mere one step afar from insane notions like thought crime . 
   malmo is now the rape capital of europe and , some argue , even the rape capital of perhaps the world . 
  is what he said . 
  we all know what the underlining purpose of this statement was , however , he purposefully did not mention why he considers malmo is that way , so it is not incitement of hatred in any provable way .

  oh , damn , my bad . 
  sorry dude , i mistook you for the original replier . 
  i failed to notice you are not stevenfries , i thought it was some kind of a cop out remark . 
  i edited out the last sentence . 
   the notion of war is silly , neither croatia nor serbia can afford it does not matter , the bosniaks will try and deal with it themselves if they are left alone and rs starts seceding . 
  there is absolutely 0 % chance they let rs go . 
  i am not right wing , let alone a far one . 
  edit ; edited out sentence , mistook replier, 
   but they needed nearly all the western powers to hold that part of hungary . 
  they did n't though . 
  ... and what the hell are you talking about `` nearly all the western powers '' lol ? 
  france was an ally to the ottomans , britain did n't give a toss and most of the rest did n't help either . 
  hell , austria was fighting most of the protestant world at the same time it was left slapping the ottomans on two fronts . 
   to even stand a chance against a ottoman empire with lots of internal trouble they had troops from italy and even protestant kingdoms/empires enter their wars . 
  no , they had some mercenaries as it was common . 
  the protestants fought against the austrians for most of the time . 
   i still fail to see how habsburg empire rivaled the ottoman empire in terms of power . 
  because it was their major rival and , in the end , they won the wars . 
   no where did you state that you are only talking about the war in hungary ? 
  me ;  how did they managed to achieve a stalemate in ** the 1526 -- 1568 war ** then ? 
   you have to understand that freedom of speech does not mean freedom of consequences . 
  i do understand that . 
   farage is allowed to say whatever it is he wants . 
  however if what he says is based on lies , and he is aware of that , but he continues to spread misinformation with the intention of devaluation of person / company or any other organization , then , while he is still allowed to speak , he still must face the consequences of his actions . 
  but he stated something about a civic municipality , not a person or a group of people . 
   i am allowed to spread information that you are a sex offender , but you are allowed to hold me accountable for those lies , and rightfully so , since my baseless accusations can have a serious impact on your life . 
  yes , rightfully so , because i am a person . 
  the equivalent of nigel saying stupid stuff about some city is me saying that toyota cars are shitty and break often , why the hell should i be prosecuted for that ? 
   i hope this clears up the opposing point of view for you it does n't , i fully understand the limits of free speech , but i had no idea that the uk considers slandering countries or cities illegal , because that sounds batshit insane to me . 
  ... what ? 
   ca n't you just google it yourself before asking simple questions ? 
  you are the one who failed to use google , that war was over a 100 years from the first siege , i was talking about the war in hungary ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ottoman%e2%80%93habsburg_wars_in_hungary_ ( 1526 % e2 % 80 % 931568 )  then what is this ? 
  what i wrote . 
  try reading it again and again until you read it properly . 
  ... of a municipality ? 
  seriously ? 
  you can not talk smack about cities in the uk ? 
  what 's next , a crime against offending park benches ? 
  it could be another war if the rs tries to secede . 
  putin 's wealth is estimated from 40 to 200 billion though . 
   the result of the 40 years of war was not due to the habsburg empire alone . 
  who else helped ? 
   also how am i the one to compare based on one battle when you are the one to bring up the stalemate of the 1529 siege ? 
  no i did not . 
  he is kind of a prick , but i fail to see how what he said is illegal in any way . 
   also comparing power of two empires by one battle that is what you are doing . 
  i am comparing the results of a 40 year long war . 
  how did they managed to achieve a stalemate in the 1526 -- 1568 war then ? 
   so let it be the chinese century , europeans will be well off regardless . 
  `` so let it be a germanic century , romans will be well off regardless . '',
