  meanwhile , india 's population increased by a 100 million in 6 years . 
  they are growing at the rate of one romania per year . 
  this was from a long gone long age long ago . 
  before the [ dreaded hyperwar with the koreans ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/hispedia/images/b/b2/finno-korean_hyperwar_info.png/revision/latest?cb=20160409030204 ) . 
  while the numbers can be inflated , it is a fact that the portuguese had complete naval supremacy over that entire region , they even wrecked the mamluk and ottoman fleets with ease . 
  quick wiki search brings up the point quite clearly ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_pandarane https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_cannanore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first_battle_of_cannanore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_gulf_of_oman https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_calicut_ ( 1502 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_aceh_ ( 1569 ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_river_duyon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/naval_battle_of_calicut_ ( 1752 ),

  the lowest tower seems like a crossbowman 's dream come true . 
  correct , the sassanid rule was borderline satire during the period of the arab invasion . 
  they actually let a 12 year old ruler decide things without a regent . 
   they did in fact manage to field extremely impressive armies against the arabs but still lose . 
  well , the numbers are quite unreliable and the quality of the army and troops would be doubtful at best . 
  you are correct about the arab cavalry supremacy being a major factor , but it is also true that the roman army during this time was utterly pathetic in all but size . 
   italy ( at least parts of it ) they did not fully lose their italian territories until 1071 , meaning they held on to italy for over 400 years . 
   polish-lithuanian commonwealth . 
  for how many years of the 250 year habsburg ottoman conflict were they allied to austria ? 
  also , they are not nearly the `` half of europe '' , southern france alone had a larger population . 
   it is no secret that vienna was about to fall when polish managed to reach to siege site thanks to the betrayal of crimean army and managed to stop ottomans . 
  vienna was nowhere near surrendering or falling when the poles came . 
   first siege was not serious pathetic revisionism . 
   the goal was to just test the waters ridiculous statement , you wreak of nationalism . 
  armies so huge are not mustered unless total conquest is the goal , and the ottomans failed miserably . 
   which two are you even talking about sulejman returned 3 years later with an even bigger army but was halted at kiseg ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_g%c3%bcns the invasion failed . 
  some decades after that , another invasion of vienna was planned and led personally by sulejman , but was halted at siget ; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_szigetv%c3%a1r the army was hampered and the army retreated after a costly victory . 
   would n't matter either way . 
  it possibly could have mattered quite a lot . 
  you can not wage ww2 without enough oil . 
   they defeated the ottomans with the help of half of the europe . 
  which half ? 
  you mean some small states ? 
  because france , the most powerful military on the continet , was another enemy of austria , not to mention all of protestant europe for quite some time . 
   if they were alone vienna would have fell . 
  they were alone at vienna the first time and it did not fall . 
  the next two times the ottomans failed to even reach vienna . 
   no country came close to their power . 
  the habsburg empire did . 
  to be fair , it took the ottomans nearly a 100 years to take them out . 
  then it took them nearly 100 years to take out the hungarians and croats . 
  that is quite a slow down if you ask me . 
  you are correct about the mamluks , but technically , egypt was still a province of the empire and not a vassal state , so you would need a third color to represent it . 
  you have to open the file to get the direct gif link . 
  also , those balkan conquest borders are incredibly incorrect . 
  uh , i do n't think the territory of hungary was in peace for any significant amount of time . 
  the inner balkans and their portion of the middle east though , yes . 
  but taking baku would be much , much easier and it would result in a collapse of most of the soviet oil supply regardless . 
  oh , i was not referring to his second sentence .

   it would have been stalingrad to be fair , the soviets were at a brink during those weeks just as the germans were , far more than in 1942 when the soviet military machine was already recovered . 
  well , hitler was a moron and chose stalingrad instead . 
  yes , even without the eastern conquests russia was twice as large , with about 2 million km2 . 
  i do n't understand , wikipedia states denmark had 593 billion of external debt in 2014 , they payed all that off in two and a half years ? 
  heh , you reminded me of that keith olbermann video .

  dude , you need to gain some muscle mass , jesus . 
  i imagined slender man when you stated that . 
   plc was what is russia today , but without equivalent for nukes . 
  a faulty analogy for the 16th and 17th century . 
  russia was what russia is today during those times . 
   big , poor , underdeveloped , pathetic state . 
  ridiculous statement , it had many cities and developed urbanized areas . 
   prussia , austria , sweden were smaller , less populated yet they were real threat . 
  the kingdom of england was a major threat to larger france for quite a while , that does not mean france was less developed than england . 
  russia was larger from the moment the tsardom was formed . 
  other than that only the roman empire and frankish empire come to mind . 
  beautiful . 
   russia entered in 1917 you mean left ? 
  i thought you meant the usage of it online in general . 
  i fail to see how usage of it in germany could have got people triggered . 
   that is the fault of those getting triggered at merely mentioning the phrase . 
  no , it is the fault of a lot of people using that term being utter cunts . 
  you forgot something ? 
  lol no , they had nearly 4 million square km during the fascist rule ( mostly african territory ) . 
  the [ kingdom of romania ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_romania ) during the 20th century was larger than modern day romania until 1940 . 
  territory 295,049 km \u00b2 compared to the modern 238,391 km \u00b2 . 
  sweden . 
  the scumbag steve of the 17th century . 
   there wo n't be any streams today . 
  well , i 'd rather ze germans took over . 
  i heard croats employed here in kaufland and lidl have it a lot better than those employed by konzum . 
   america has no `` far-left '' , it barely has a left . 
  yes it does , it has quite a large number of antifa groups , also socialists , communists and a loads of various other similar groupations across the country . 
  quite the [ interesting bunch ] ( http://i.imgur.com/uxn4sb3.jpg ) the lot of them . 
   show me european far-left supporters `` blaming white people '' . 
  lol are you serious ? 
  ever heard of volkstod ? 
  well , shit . 
   american democrat `` far-left '' , that was funny . 
  that one is . 
   ignoring that the american dynamic is irrelevant in europe . 
  what is the difference between her and imbeciles of her likeness doing basically the same here ? 
  far left in europe is antifa and the likes , not your average friendly democratic socialist . 
  [ sure thing buddy .

  i have no idea . 
  i did notice african girls that come here to croatia during the summer smell like freshly cut grass and coconut though . 
   the far left blames the ones responsible ; large corporations ( for the most part ) .
