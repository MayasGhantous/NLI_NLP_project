\\  having croatian name \\  is a serb \\  trying to make up for it by being more idiotic than the average chetnik, 
  for a lot of young europeans that 's the only thing they know about the region and its history plus there 's a shitty subreddit where it 's considered humorous so they keep posting it expecting upvotes . 
  yes , the article has been updated since it was first posted . 
  you know what would be even even better ? 
  having normal neighbors . 
  i would n't call this a petty squabble . 
  uncontrolled immigration is serious business and a country the size of croatia ca n't afford to become the dumping ground for hundreds of thousands of foreigners who have all sorts of needs . 
  even if they 're only passing through it 's still a huge burden . 
  i thought that was implied . 
  borders closed , only passenger cars went through . 
  they do though i think there are some limits but croatia also has the full sovereignty over its borders and can stop people from entering the country . 
  * croatia closes the border to stop the immigrant flood , passenger cars still allowed * serbian minister threatens to sue croatia for whatever * croatian pm says he does n't care about their threats * serbian pm gives croatia a deadline to open the border * or else * * croatian pm is like `` lol whatcha gon na do '' * serbia forbids croatian cargo trucks to enter the country ( this is a big deal because croatian companies own some of the biggest retailers in serbia and use them to flood their market with our superior freedom-certified products ) * read the title edit : article updated , serbs can enter croatia but not in cars with serbian registration plates, 
  if only . 
  i 'm not a big fan of milanovic but i 'm very happy with the way he 's handling serbia right now , whatever his motives might be . 
  closes the border , compares them to insects , makes fun of their threats , now completely forbids them to enter the country . 
  i hope it lasts for at least a few days because i 'm really enjoying this standoff , more so because serbian media are in a near complete control by the current ruling party which is pushing the narrative that because of their reforms serbia is now a regional power that the whole of europe has immense respect for . 
  they 've been repeating that lie for so long that they started believing it 's true and that they can afford to threaten croatia . 
  well , see what happens when you act tough :d, 
  we 're counted under serbia because the guy is a moldovan troll pretending to be a serb nationalist . 
   we forced hungary to take in immigrants by sending them to their border and ** that 's what we 'll continue doing . 
  ** i 'm so erect now . 
  i do n't care about kosovo . 
  the price of freedom : /, 
  collateral damage . 
  if their intent was really to kill the civilians there would be way , way more than 200-1200 ( depending on the claim ) of them dead . 
   forcibly annexed what was integral part of croatia since 925 ad . 
  also https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/demographics_of_rsk.jpg same thing in bosnia . 
  ethnic cleansing then `` muh rights , hurr durr democracy '' . 
  * usta\u0161e were called out for not being clinical enough . 
  they took time to torture what they considered subhumans instead of just rounding them up and shooting . 
  this helped the partisan propaganda and made our soldiers job harder , that 's why we could n't help much against russians and that 's why hitler was angry . 
  he did n't give a fuck about brutality . 
  * what i do and say in other subs is none of their business . 
  i 'm not applying for a position in the moderators team and being very civil in the comments here . 
  * whether 1,352 mine incidents is a lot or not really depends on the perspective . 
  but i understand why to someone from serbia this might seem a small number . 
  to me it is n't . 
  [ haters gon na hate . 
  ] ( http://streamable.com/6qmz ), 
  well they did crush a rebellion and liberate ~ 20 % of croatia 's territory . 
  i think geography plays a major role in that decision as well . 
  we have the mighty cold danube , which is very well patrolled considering which country is on the other side , and bosnians have big motherfucking mountains that one does not simply walk through . 
  greater croatia does n't need any walls or fences because our eastern comrades , in their honorable quest for preservation of brotherhood and unity of south slavic peoples , planted [ lots and lots of mines ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jw8cn98.png ) in our lands so wandering off the main roads here would be like playing russian roulette . 
  sputnik is bad but they ca n't fake interviews with country leaders . 
  why does the most active commenter in / r/serbia have a croatian flair in / r/europe ? 
  are you trying to make us look bad ? 
  did someone force you out of krajina or something ? 
  i 'm not blaming them for anything , they 're just being themselves . 
  serbs have special ~ ~ fetish ~ ~ feelings for russia since 19th century . 
  democratic front 's ( main opposition coalition ) biggest party is called new serb democracy and you can read what their leader thinks about nato [ here . 
  ] ( http://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/mandic-objedinicemo-snage-koje-se-protive-ulasku-u-nato-827431 ) and according to another member of that coalition , in case of a nato referendum , he believes that around 90 % of their supporters [ would vote against ] ( http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/partije-imaju-stav-o-nato-glasaci-dijelom-u-dilemi/26885772.html ) montenegro 's membership . 
  so eu/usa 's support for milo makes complete sense . 
  they do n't want more russian allies on the balkans , no matter how small they are . 
   every time montenegro 's ruling elite was at a risk of losing power , it received political support from the us and the eu that 's because , from what i know , the opposition ( mostly serb ) parties are pro-russian and they do n't want montenegro to join nato . 
  macedonians are bulgarians with identity crisis . 
  lactose tolerance is so ableist , i ca n't even . 
  30 euros ? 
  3 euro a kilo ?!, 
  i pay double that for the store brand plastic !, 
  nigga you must be smoking someth - oh of course . 
  cheese is the watermelon of white people . 
  they still have n't fixed their tractors from the last time . 
   the only big and widely accepted conspiracy theory is that the whole world is conspiring against turkey . 
  haha just like our eastern neighbors . 
  do you have any traditional allies ? 
  maybe azerbaijan or some of the turkic countries ? 
  he 's a serbian nationalist and for them russia is the bestest country in the universe , no pills can change that . 
  it 's been 1 year and 5 months since those elections and he was in jail back then . 
  and you ca n't compare hdz to the fucking radicals . 
   chetnik voivoda as the title means nothing . 
  outside their movement no but having prominent politicians who are high-ranking members in neo-fascist organizations is worrying . 
  you wo n't find that in croatia , not even among the far-right . 
   ustasha thompson he 's denying it . 
  it 's obvious that he has sympathies for them but he 's not openly advocating annexation of bosnia and mass murder of serbs and gypsies . 
  and he 's only a singer . 
  bora \u010corba is a neo-fascist as well but he 's not shaping serbia 's foreign policy . 
  he even holds the rank of chetnik voivoda , just like serbian president , while thompson has no official affiliation with neo-ustashe groups . 
   he achieves more than ~ 70 % of the croatian population source ? 
  yeah , i agree . 
  that man who burned croatian flag is the leader of the far-right serbian radical party which according to [ this poll ] ( http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=05&amp;dd=25&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=996254 ) enjoys a 7 % support in serbia . 
  he 's still advocating a greater serbia . 
  very concerning . 
   but her husband attended it . 
  so what ? 
  he 's not a government official . 
   hdz is opposition in sabor , but the croatian president is from hdz . 
  regardless , her husband has nothing to do with the country 's politics . 
   his other popular songs glorify concentration camps , searching for his grandpas usta\u0161e uniform in the attic , quoting paveli\u0107 etc. 
  i know , i like his stuff . 
  i doubt he sung about that last night but even if he did it 's not because our foreign ministry told him to . 
   still , that sentiment should be condemned . 
  absolutely . 
  i was just explaining the circumstances as it 's not something that happens often . 
  we killed just enough serbs to have a free country , there 's no need for such chants 20 years after the war . 
  defend it by shelling zagreb and bihac ? 
  there would be no need for defense if they recognized the central government . 
   what is going on there ? 
  concert of a famous nationalist singer . 
   what could possibly motivate this kind of shameful display now ? 
  20th anniversary of the operation storm which ended the croatian war of independence and the concert is being held in the city which was occupied by serb rebels for almost 5 years .
