  the concert was n't organized , attended or paid for by the croatian government . 
  even our right-wing president avoided it . 
  the wheelchair guy on the stage is aligned with the opposition and he used the opportunity to criticize current prime minister . 
  thompson was a fighter who occasionally recorded some war songs . 
  some of them were hugely popular and the one about [ defending his hometown ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cubcp2wgkyw ) ( english subs ) is like the unofficial tune of the croatian war of independence . 
  this concert is held annually in the singer 's birth town but they moved it to knin for the operation storm anniversary . 
  knin was the seat of the croatian serb rebels who occupied parts of croatia and committed numerous crimes against our civilians . 
  some people , especially those who were affected by the war , are still mad about it and among them the anti-serb sentiment runs high . 
  thompson 's concert is the perfect place to express it .

  ah , the good ol' reddit [ slovenia-roo ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3duobz/my_sister_and_i_got_matching_shirts/ct8wcsd?context=3 ) . 
  serbia 's most used words in their exact order make a nice little nationalistic poem : * [ serbia war bosnia croatia , kill albania , crime kosovo , shit support really yeah , everyone yugoslavia , nazi bad , language comment , talking hungary ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bttsqpa.png ) * also i 'm surprised that slovakia talks more about immigration than estonia . 
  romanians and hungarians talk a lot about each other . 
  the french have a french word on the list ( hmm i wonder who got it there ) . 
  israel 's top word is `` banks '' [ hahaha ] ( http://i.imgur.com/qjiogxf.jpg ) . 
  this is really interesting , thanks for sharing it . 
  serbs from lika took a voluntary , indefinite vacation to belgrade , no one forced them to leave . 
  they ran away fearing retaliation from croatian army for all the evils they inflicted upon our people during the rebellion . 
  while there is a noticeable middle eastern influence both on their looks and mindset , which is normal for someone who got abused by the not-so-gentle anatolians for 500 years , they 're still mostly european . 
  no , only americans and australians . 
  maybe if you came here more often ... you know , the summer season is starting so ... :d, 
  the part about czechs has some words i do n't know how to translate so i skipped it . 
  but for you : ** czechs ** put all their stuff in the apartment , put a cover over the car and there 's no way they 're going to drive it till the end of the vacation , even though they 're touring the whole riviera . 
  they know every supermarket in the town , they know about all the free events , they endlessly wander around beaches and mountains ... only after they see everything they sit down for a beer . 
  just like czech women love to show their boobs , czech men love displaying their big guts . 
  to avoid any worries about getting sunburned during the vacation , they prefer to do it the first day and then brag among themselves who has the reddest skin . 
  you feel a bit sad when they leave because they 're cheerful and there 's not a bit of evil in them . 
  but their daughter will marry your cousin so they 'll come around anyway . 
  i do n't consider myself a troll but judging by all these downvotes and replies from serbs i think i would be pretty good at it , 
  50 years between wwii and serbian aggression on croatia . 
  do you really think that milo\u0161evi\u0107 's masses and the soldiers doing the killings here remembered wwii ? 
  that 's the lamest excuse ever . 
   replace jasenovac with serbia 's 90s war crimes and croatian nazis with serb nationalists you 're trying to relativise the 90s with wwii stuff . 
   we 'd rather never be good at anything and have shitty countries than live with * them * part of the reason why some countries in our neighborhood are shitty is because * they * came here and started killing , raping , looting and destroying everything . 
  so while * some * would love to see the neighbor 's cow ( and the neighbor himself ) dead for no apparent reason , some of us have damn good reasons to wish the same back . 
   you brought up genocide  you brought up a war did i really ? 
  i only used a not so nice term for people i have not so nice feelings for while expressing the general sentiment among croats regarding these `` if yugoslavia were a thing '' threads/ideas . 
  no mention of any war . 
  and i did n't say the genocides they committed were against croats . 
  there was a bot on reddit that used to post a comment whenever hitler was first mentioned in a thread . 
  i think a similar one should be made for jasenovac because that 's the go-to justification for every wrong serbs ever did ( and you did them a lot ) . 
  some croatian nazi collaborators killed serbs and gypsies 70 years ago and for that reason i 'm not allowed to have any negative feelings towards them despite all the atrocities they committed in my homeland not too long ago . 
  another link in english was removed for being a local crime story . 
  honestly , i do n't see a problem with that . 
  i posted something about rapes in some indian city a while ago and they removed it for the same reason . 
  are n't you a serb ? 
  why do n't you flair up ? 
   so much nonsense and ignorance and serbs . 
  they were all over the kumanovo attack threads as well . 
  they hate you more than anything and they 're pulling the same historic revisionism they do with all other south slavic countries . 
  unless you want / r/europe to accept for a fact that you truly are these immoral , baby killing , organ stealing islamic terrorists guilty of massacring the innocent and peaceful serbian army - start being more active here . 
  expected answer . 
  i counted the ukraine-related articles and there are 24 of them . 
  that leaves us with 72 stories about russia , or 10/day . 
  top result links to croatian wiki article about saint patrick which says that according to a legend he banished all snakes and venomous animals from ireland . 
   at least we 're not serbia amen !, 
  he is my neighbor nursultan tuliagby . 
  he is pain in my assholes . 
  i get a window from a glass , he must get a window from a glass . 
  i get a ~ ~ clock radio ~ ~ dashboard camera , he can not afford . 
  great success !, 
  i could n't fit switzerland : `` not in the eu '' . 
  but there 's really nothing about latvia , estonia , slovakia , czech republic ... 
  france - a women 's self-help book sweden - [ song ] ( http://lyricstranslate.com/en/dubioza-kolektiv-brijuni-brioni-islands.html ) czechia - surprised there 's literally nothing about our favorite tourists, 
   serbia 1/3 greek , near eastern , north african , jewish , arabic you 're not fighting the kebab . 
  you * are * the kebab . 
  :d also , i did n't expect us to be more slavic than bulgarians or belarus to be 1/4 south slavic . 
  no idea how that happened .

  stop trying to make croatia look better than it actually is . 
  we 're the real baddies on the balkans . 
  i 'll have to use my download ratios wisely . 
  hopefully i 'll survive with 2 megabytes daily . 
  udba needs me here . 
  no , just a humanist croat who sees through the anti-serb propaganda and wishes it all to stop , to live peacefully with the good and largely misunderstood people from serbia . 
  unfortunately very few of the 624,000 expelled croatian serbs returned to their homes here and even those who did have terrible internet and other infrastructure as they 're institutionally oppressed by our government who uses them as scapegoat for everything . 
  we even elected a far right government with literal neo-nazis as ministers . 
  the first serbian churches on kosovo were built before even illyrians migrated to the balkans . 
  but that 's not the topic . 
  why ca n't you just let them commemorate this tragic event ? 
  what you 're doing here is exactly what an oppressor would do . 
  shit on the memories of the victims , deny genocides and massacres , try to relativize their suffering and provoke the mourners with some myths and alternative history bullshit . 
  more than 700,000 serbs were killed in jasenovac concentration camp alone . 
  people supposedly killed by serbs ( and those numbers are hugely inflated as they counted people who died from natural causes as well ) did not have to go through the hell of nato 's bombings , the sound of american jets and the depleted uranium in the air . 
  what did [ she ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7snhysd.jpg ) do to deserve it ? 
  kosovo is historical serb land , just like crimea is russian so how can kosovo declare independence and crimea ca n't ? 
  all i 'm saying is historical context and numbers do n't matter , it 's all relative , all sides suffered and serbs probably suffered more than anyone but you wo n't hear about it on cnn or bbc . 
  look who 's talking  i doubt kosovo will ever join albania . 
  please stick to the topic . 
  this is about serbian victims . 
  it 's not a competition . 
  you 're probably right . 
  from what i 've heard kosovo albanians are a lot more religious than those from albania . 
  probably has a lot to do with enver hoxha 's attitude towards religion . 
  this is very , very sad . 
  here : http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/objavljenepublikacije/g1921/pdf/g19214001.pdf [ arnauts is the old turkish name for albanians which was used in serbia as well ] do you think there was a separate kosovar nation ?
