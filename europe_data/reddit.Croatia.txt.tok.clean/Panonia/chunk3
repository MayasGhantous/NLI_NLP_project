   in kosovo there has been serbs , ** kosovars muslims ** , macedonians ** and a minority of albanians ** . 
  i thought kosovar muslims were in fact albanians ? 
  i mean the first [ census in 1921 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographic_history_of_kosovo#1921_census ) says that 65.8 % of population spoke albanian . 
  we ca n't do it [ pick a side ] , and the reason is our past and what made us us . 
  we simply ca n't make a choice and that 's why we 're friends to both '' they think they can be buddies with everyone but they 're forgetting that they 're not switzerland . 
  to be truly neutral you have to be respected , which serbia is n't ; not even in its own neighborhood and much less on the world stage . 
   there are up to 300,000 turkish-russian married couples . 
  most russian immigrants to turkey are women . 
  turkish men traditionally devote themselves to families and russian women like it , when men take responsibility for decision making . 
   russian women often are in charge of their households in their own country , where they husbands can be notoriously feckless , but many women would love to delegate responsibilities to a man . 
   there is a term for a henpecked man in russian , `` podkabluchnik , '' or kept under a woman 's heels . 
  but that 's not necessarily the way women want things . 
  and some of the russian wives in istanbul go to the other extreme . 
  one wrote in her social media profile , `` i am a girl . 
  i do not want to decide anything . 
  i want a dress . '', 
  as far as helicopters go , nothing beats the hungarian mi-24 : http://i.imgur.com/j6aqoua.jpg,

'', 
   `` it would be great to publish a list of the ten people most responsible for corruption in bih , and it seems that everyone here already knows who these people are , '' said cormack . 
   month and a half after she made the announcement , influential us senator roger wicker requested the administration of president barack obama to draw concrete moves and punish b&h politicians involved in corruption . 
  it might seem strange that someone would want to be on a most corrupted list but i think he 's just trying to score some political points by mentioning the united states , largely unpopular among serbs , and black list in the same sentence . 
  he 's trying to give the impression of a strong leader who protects serbdom and does n't bow to anyone , not even the mighty usa . 
  i did use the original title , replacing only `` nikolic '' with `` serbian president '' because most / r/europe readers would n't know who he is from the last name only . 
  added the relevant quote as well because the subheader does n't expand on the title at all . 
  the part of the quote i supposedly left out  the serb nation is in a crisis '' while he `` only wants serbia to create the conditions for its citizens , including serbs to extend the species . '', 
  ** does not appear ** in the linked article at all . 
  did you even read it ? 
  no , because you were just looking for reasons to remove . 
  speaking about agendas ... 3 . 
  i submit articles about croatia and neighboring countries because that 's what i 'm interested in . 
  are you going to moderate my interests ? 
  and the people reporting me , a handful of serbians and serb diaspora , are doing so only because they 're butthurt . 
  le evil usta\u0161a wrote this ( in another subreddit , yes ) , muh jasenovac , muh this and that . 
  i 'm trying my best to be as nice and polite to them as possible , even when we 're discussing some sensitive topics like croatian war of independence . 
  they openly approve of and defend crimes against our civilians and i still never called them any bad names and i ignore accusations of fascism . 
  note : the adjective he used here ( `` serb '' ) refers only to ethnic serbs , not all serbians of various ethnicities ( 300k hungarians , 160k bosniaks , 60k croats , 50k slovaks etc. ), 
  whose president he officially is . 
  their pm tried to sound as threatening as possible while saying `` if croatia does n't buy new weapons , we wo n't either '' . 
  like anyone here , except for the intelligence services , gives a flying fuck about what they do . 
  also the leader of the currently biggest party here said that `` the gentlemen in serbia should better invest that money into economy '' . 
  haha i 'm lovin it :d, 
   as a official representative of croatia well , i did n't vote for you . 
   i hope we let the serbian minority secede is this a popular sentiment in kosovo ? 
  how much of the area ( % ) do they occupy ? 
  serbians are citizens of serbia and as you very well know kosovo is n't serbia  the less power they get the better it is for you . 
  see montenegro . 
  then see bosnia . 
  you do n't want to be a bosnia . 
  i 'm surprised by the lack of interest in this story in this sub . 
  a submission in / r/worldnews posted 15 minutes before this one is currently at 480 points . 
  while this one about a major even in a european country posted in * the * european subreddit is at 30 . 
  / r/europe is pretty much western europe + poland . 
  eastern europe is mentioned only when russia acts up or a refugee does something stupid . 
  well the pre-war majority of the population in those towns that wanted them in bosnia was either massacred or banished so it would be very wrong to award their murderers and the new majority with independence . 
  i think they still give a shit and they will give even more once hilary , which knows this region very well , comes to power . 
  the talk is about bosnian serbs . 
  bosnia did n't fight austria-hungary . 
  a few percent difference but our economy is in a much better state and we can afford to dick around with shiny new weapons . 
   nazi and anti-semitic posts on this sub where exactly ? 
  why are you so edgy ? 
  added google translate . 
  why do n't you put croatian flair ? 
  [ google translate ] ( https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=hr&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fhr.n1info.com%2fa95491%2fsvijet%2fregija%2faleksandar-vucic-zamolio-sad-da-hrvatskoj-ne-isporuci-oruzje.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url ) some context : trying to match croatia 's military might is an absolute priority for the former radical who came to power after forming a new party which ( officially ) has a slightly more moderate rhetoric . 
  but both our government and the opposition agree that he 's not to be trusted as this same man held speeches in the occupied croatian town of glina in 1995 and just yesterday a local committee of his party celebrated orthodox christmas [ with flags ] ( http://www.blic.rs/vesti/vojvodina/vernici-naprednjaci-iz-novosadskog-sajlova-krali-badnjake-na-fruskoj-gori/7c63s6r ) of the so called republic of serbian krajina which existed in parts of croatia . 
  a few weeks ago he went to putin to discuss a possible order of attack helicopters and anti-ballistic missiles . 
  so we 're having sorts of a mini , mini cold war here . 
  it should be noted that in the past 3 years serbia 's debt to gdp ratio increased by 26 % ( to 75,5 % ) and they had to cut the already miserly pensions to lower the budget deficit so they 're not in a great position to buy new weapons . 
   let them secede https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war  serbs won in bosnia they had all the tools ( weapons ) necessary and the silent approval from france and the uk but no , they do n't have a country of their own . 
  croatian troops were 20 kms from banja luka 's center in 1995 and nato threatened to bomb us if we went all the way . 
  i understand why you 're upset but can you prove that `` war criminals '' is actually their go-to excuse ? 
  i do n't follow their news closely and i have trust issues with serbs . 
   does that justify attacking the others ? 
  [ explained here . 
   you realize thsts just bullshit , it 's them trying to legitimize reasons to attack a bus full of civies no , why would you think that ? 
  feels or facts ? 
  ^ i ^ also ^ want ^ to ^ anschluss ^ vojvodina . 
  please keep those insults to your side of danube . 
  this is n't youtube where you can just insult people based on their nationality . 
  if you do n't have anything clever to say - just do n't . 
   your most recent comment is calling serbia `` uncivilized eastern neighbors '' in historical context , they were relatively backward compared to austria-hungary . 
  funnily , there was a thread on / r/croatia the other day about the greatest fuck-up in our history and the majority of answers cited the unification with the uncivilized eastern neighbors as being the worst one . 
  also , if you truly believed that story - which is just another in an ocean of serbian myths - would n't you be at least a little upset that the country you totally brought to existence kicked your ass in the war , is now economically miles ahead and it got in a position where the mighty serbia [ is afraid ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/vucic-priznao-da-od-putina-kupuje-oruzje--neki-u-nasem-susjedstvu-kupuju-rakete-i-lansirne-rampe----ne-znam-zasto--ali-mi-moramo-stititi-svoj-teritorij-/1447314/ ) their military 's new toys ? 
  and lol * of course * you live in america . 
  are there any proper serbs here , besides these rs/diaspora bullshitters ? 
  let 's not derail this thread , this is n't the right sub for those discussions at all . 
  [ have you heard the news ? 
  that 's what i 'm talking about . 
  i wish they would all leave us alone . 
  we have enough hate as it is , we do n't need these morons completely detached from the reality of life on balkans to add more fuel to the fire . 
  only to forget about it on saturday nights when they all get together in ex-yu clubs and get piss drunk while listening to turbofolk . 
  they both live in respective countries . 
  diaspora balkanites are the worst and they all get on my nerves , regardless of origin .
