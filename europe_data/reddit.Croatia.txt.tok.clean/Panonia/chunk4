  they 're almost exclusively super-uber-nationalistic , they think they have the answers to all our problems despite spending less time here than the czech tourists , their main pastime are internet arguments about the 90s and they make us look worse than we really are . 
  that 's pretty rich coming from an emigrant . 
  beautiful photos but why are the comments so negative ? 
  two remarks about it being serbia , one from a swedish serb trying to push negative stereotypes and one completely unrelated statement about balkans . 
  do people have issues with kosovo ? 
  we 're also the [ bulwark of christianity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antemurale_christianitatis#croatia ) . 
  i wonder if spain and portugal got any fancy titles for themselves . 
  i was trying to point out to the janez bastard above that montenegro is a real nation with a real language and i did it in a jokely manner , with best intentions , but this fella did n't get the joke so i got double annoyed . 
   in the original - ** serbian ** you know that montenegrins went to a 100-year-long [ war with japan ] ( http://www.tofugu.com/2011/04/12/montenegro-japan-war/ ) over nothing ? 
  you 're not that far away , do n't make them get up . 
   if they team up with putin , we 're screwed yeah , we 'll be in deep shit . 
  americans were never good at geography . 
  i understood that . 
  things i noticed * brazilian president is hated almost equally in both brazil and portugal . 
  i 'm not sure if this is due to some hatred between the countries or just the lack of language barrier which allows the portuguese to follow brazilian politics . 
  + turks hold a negative opinion of 8/10 world leaders ; everyone except obama ( 5 % ) and dilma rousseff ( 1 % ) who are still pretty low . 
  i think they 're still butthurt over the whole ottoman collapse thing and wish to be a great power but instead are stuck selling kebabs , fighting kurds and writing comments on turkish march videos on youtube . 
  + serbians love putin as much as russians do and like xi jinping a whole lot more than angela merkel . 
  + i vastly underestimated the finnish hate for putin . 
  i knew they do n't like russia but they hate him even more ( -83 % ) than the iranians hate saudi king ( -71 % ) . 
  * [ balkan , b-b-balkan , no escape from ... ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtga0jvhp2a ) * , 
  this is a response to [ yet another ] ( http://news.yahoo.com/kosovo-opposition-releases-tear-gas-parliament-110338549.html ) ( i think 3rd or 4th ) tear gas incident in the past 2 months . 
  the main opposition party is protesting some agreement the government made with serbia regarding the status of serb-majority villages in the north . 
  the ruling coalition 's mps are obviously getting sick of it so today they came prepared . 
   `` in the global age we live in , the security of all countries is interconnected and mutually affect each other ... no one country , or group , can seek to rely only on the absolute security of its own strength . '', 
  no comprendo . 
  if nato was n't a thing and russia were to attack estonia , who should according to the chinese understanding help defend the poor country ? 
   okay sure there bud he did n't believe me so i proved him . 
  the first croatian kingdom was established in [ 925 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_croatia_%28925%e2%80%931102%29 ) . 
  there 's no proof that croatian military wanted to massacre the civilians . 
  if our army really wanted to hurt the civilian populace there would be way , way more than a couple hundred dead ( collateral damage ) in a region with 400,000 . 
  but i do believe that they were scared for their lives . 
  they know what their guys did to non-serbs just 3 years prior and i guess they thought we would do the same . 
  but thank god we 're not like that . 
  between 214 and 1,192 died during the [ operation storm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm ) . 
  186,633 are still living in croatia and they make 4,4 % of the population . 
  croatia was a state for a 1000 years , we did n't `` get '' a state , we just made it independent again . 
  the [ serbs from lika ] ( http://i.imgur.com/n9w9p0s.jpg ) were not forced out , they left voluntarily . 
  i ca n't find it right now but there 's serbian footage of rebels preparing for evacuation . 
  after a bloody ethnic cleansing of the region of non-serbs at the start of rebellion they were afraid of retaliation from croatian forces so they decided to pack the things and fuck off to serbia . 
  kosovo 's independence came 13 years later , after serbia 's failed ( prevented ) attempt at another genocide . 
  albanians were a majority in kosovo since the 1921 census and the number of serbs was steadily declining ever since . 
  you 're irrelevant europe . 
  and your countries would just mean more gray area on the map , they had no reason to include them . 
  indeed :(, 
  while wars are a very casual thing in the balkans , she 's not mentioning it for no reason . 
  six days ago serbian pm went on a visit to moscow and announced buying their weapons [ `` for defensive purposes '' ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/comments.php?nav_id=95864 )  `` if they ask why we need all this , let them raise the question of why some in our surroundings need it , when they are surrounded by nato countries on all sides , only one country is not ( a nato member ) , and that is serbia , '' said vucic . 
  #  the weapons serbia wants to buy include air defense missile systems buk , krasnopol laser-guided projectiles , as well as helicopters and radars . 
  the paper added that vucic will , in his conversation with putin , `` reiterate that serbia wants to have the best relations with russia . '', 
  the `` some in our surroundings '' is , as you can probably guess , actually croatia which in the past few years has been taking steps to modernize its military and we also got some cool stuff from the americans . 
  croatian minister of defense [ responded with ] ( http://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2015&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=29&amp;nav_id=95872 )  `` we 're a secure country and there is a whole force of rules in case something happened , to cooperate with allies and nobody will dare attack us . 
  i would add also that croatia did not even have proper rifles , and managed to defend itself . 
  we will defend ourselves in the future and nobody should be afraid of an attack , '' he stated . 
  could you list a few moderate montenegrin parties ? 
  i 'd like to read up a bit . 
  edit : why am i being downvoted and why does an attempt at a joke have more points than the helpful answer ? 
  i personally find russian much easier than polish . 
  are there any slightly larger ethnic montenegrin parties that could replace dps or do you really have to pick between a corrupt neoliberal and a bunch of russophile savages ? 
  officially yes , serbia did n't have its own army until 2006 . 
  they try to use that as an excuse like `` it was n't us , it was them yugoslavs and their pan-yugoslav paramilitaries who just so happened to talk about greater serbia , have chetnik insignia and went on to commit various massacres against non-serbs in the following 3 years '' . 
  the vukovar battle occurred 3 months after the independence referendum on which 93 % of croatia 's citizens voted in favor of independence . 
  that happened as well but eastern slavonia is where regular serbian troops from serbia entered croatia . 
  after the vukovar debacle , the pyrrhic victory against a much weaker but well motivated enemy , milosevic decided to stop embarrassing himself and focus on sending paramilitaries and aiding the local serbs who rebelled in various parts of croatia and bosnia . 
  it worked for about 3 years until [ a big storm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm ) happened , 
  yes , they completely leveled our [ town of vukovar ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_vukovar ) where 1,800 self organized defenders held against 30,000 professional yugoslav soldiers ( from serbia ) + a couple thousand paramilitaries for 3 months . 
  20 years their soldiers came over here and killed some of my family ( i was a kid back then ) so i have developed a great interest in that nation , i 'm trying to understand it and along the way i 'm sharing some of my findings on reddit . 
  milo djukanovic is a democratically elected but fairly corrupt politician who has been in power for the past 17 years . 
  his coalition for european montenegro won 45.6 % of the votes in 2012 elections and formed the government with the help of bosniak party and croatian civic initiative . 
  his centre-left party led the country to independence and holds a pro-eu and pro-nato stance . 
  the main opposition is the conservative serbian df ( 22.8 % ) which has a soft spot for russia and which voted against a nato resolution in the montenegrin parliament last month . 
  a lot of ( ethnic ) montenegrins are unhappy with milo 's government but they still consider him the lesser evil . 
  right , that 's what i was referring to with * 50 years or so * . 
  they used their ~ ~ soccer ~ ~ ^ omg ^ i 'm ^ americanizing their football karma back then and it looks like they 're still recharging . 
  it 's also very italian and albanians have special relations with italy . 
  it 's probably not that big in hungary cause they 've been shit in the past 50 years or so . 
  do you remember any examples of names that are normal somewhere else being banned in italy ? 
  i have a problem with your pal above framing the inter-albanian row as an attack on serbs then completely ignoring my reply , sans the immediate downvote . 
  those same mps went on elections knowing that if they get elected , they 'll represent the kosovo serbs in kosovo 's parliament where they 'll discuss laws that will affect on the republic of kosovo . 
  but now they 're like `` we do n't want to do our job , pls send paycheck '' . 
  from reading the comments on their online media , both liberal and right leaning , i got the honest impression that the vast majority really do believe that recognizing kosovo 's independence is the main requirement for their accession , but not because the eu officials said or hinted at it but rather because of their victim complex . 
  the west hates serbia and is doing everything possible to hurt it . 
  but they still want to join the eu because money . 
  eu is not to blame for greece . 
  greek politicians who cooked the books are . 
  even in these times of hardship the majority of greeks want their country to remain in the eu . 
   a couple of days ago teargas was released in a meeting the kosovo parliament session or some separate meeting with the serbs ? 
  if it 's the former - why should there be any pressure on anyone ? 
  they 're politicians , grown up men , who are throwing tomatoes and eggs and having fights with each other . 
  it 's immature but it does n't hurt anyone . 
  btw the ones who released the teargas were some of the opposition mps who are against normalization , not the government . 
  and serbian mps are boycotting these sessions because of some albanian symbols in the building or whatever . 
  according to comments on serbian sites those guys moved permanently to malta after the murder of [ brice taton ] ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8280399.stm ) . 
  maybe they had something to do with it . 
  supposedly the croatians from torcida and armada fan groups , who were previously banned from attending the game but still went there regardless , wanted to enter some night club and the serbian bouncers asked them to pay 10x the regular price for the tickets ( 30 instead of 3 euro ) . 
  those bouncers just so happen to be members of grobari ( partizan belgrade ) fan group who already got their ass kicked by visiting bosnian fans ( \u017deljezni\u010dar sarajevo ) 4 months ago . 
  they were asking for it and our fans did n't need much persuasion . 
  i guess we can add malta to the lengthy list of countries where we had a fight , 
   logically come to the conclusion you have high expectations of serbian peasants . 
  [ turkish dna ] ( https://i.imgur.com/yvpkmse.jpg )  the letter goes on to compare the step to `` martyrdom '' , although it stresses that the converts would `` keep jesus christ in their heart '' . 
  so they 're going to sacrifice themselves for that roof and still sort of kinda like jes\u00fas .
