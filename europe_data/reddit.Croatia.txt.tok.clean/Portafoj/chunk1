yeah , but i expected something taller . 
  this not barrier at all . 
  it looks like average man can jump over it without even touching it , let alone damaging it . 
  this just looks like waste of high quality barbed wire . 
  :d and is n't just illegal entry felony for which person can be expelled ?

  i do n't know what to say . 
  except pm multiple times explicitly said that army is not the solution . 
  oh , i get it now . 
  i was a little baffled when he did n't mention italy in his post because whole dalmatia has that italian spirit from centuries of venetian rule . 
  i just supposed that he has never been to dalmatia . 
  now this confirms it . 
  regarding our glorious president , i think it is sad that her looks are only ( positive ) thing that comes to one 's mind . 
  so , something similar as in croatia .

  giant , fenced building in the middle of nowhere with windowless top floor . 
  during 2012 and 2013 while croatian treaty of accession was being ratified by each member state , croatian parliament appointed 12 observers to the european parliament which were as meps but did n't have right to vote . 
  one of those observers tried to deliver speech in english . 
  she tried to act as that is ordinary thing for her , but her pronunciation was so awful that it made news and was ridiculed by whole country . 
  subsequently , she was removed from party list for `` real '' elections . 
  speech became known as : `` pipl mast trast as '' which is croatian way of writing : `` people must trust us '' as everyone was joking that it was writtent that way on her notes . 
  i 'm too ashamed to link it , but if you want to hear it just google : pipl mast trast as . 
   you don ` t and for me in some words is almost impossible to guess where it should be . 
  it should n't be anywhere , because we simply do n't pronounce that sound . 
  * not a linguist . 
  now when you say it , it could be . 
  since croatian police have white motorbikes . 
   \u041f\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0449\u0430 if \u0449 is pronounced [ like this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/ru-%d1%89%d0%b8.ogg ) ( but without `` i '' , of course ) and not something like \u0448\u0447 then you are missing a letter . 
  `` correct '' way of writing it would be like this \u041f\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0448\u045b\u0430 where \u045b is letter from serbian alphabet : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tshe, 
  because there is no evidence whatsoever that he was in croatia any other time . 
  surely , after story broke , croatian intelligence agencies could have broken into his apartment to scan his passport just to make him look bad . 
  but that does n't look plausible . 
  and thing with scanned passport is that border crossing tovarnik is ad hoc border crossing for refugees/migrants and because of that everybody is photographed and every passport is scanned . 
  i believe that police fingerprint people also , but i 'm not sure . 
  if he had passed border on regular border crossing i believe he would n't have had his passport scaned . 
  from minister of interior 's facebook [ page ] ( https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207991418644660&amp;set=a.1289188871177.43397.1273880431&amp;type=3&amp;theater ) : he expresses his content because police caught this guy lying about hiding in toilet . 
  he also says that is where he belongs , as well as newspaper he works for . 
  because he was registered at border crossing `` tovarnik '' which is made exclusively for refugees/migrants . 
  also , date of entry in his article is same one as one croatian police published . 
  yeah , i found that odd , too . 
  maybe that was their way of deterring others in publishing such news or just their way of saying ` fuck you ' . 
  i believe that ca n't cause anything more than some inconvenience , but still , your point stands . 
  that is museum of contemporary art in zagreb , if anyone is wondering . 
  no , it is not good for me . 
  it is fucked up situation that is not good for anyone . 
  i was referencing that heritage thing and implication that croatia should give in because of that . 
   with which we share a long history and common heritage etc. 
  and now it 's gone . 
  surely , that is beautiful heritage from hungarian perspective . 
  here , no one ( i know ) could n't care less . 
  `` di\u0161pet '' is the word you are looking for . 
  it is dalmatian version of `` inat '' . 
  i believe that word has roots in italian `` dispetto '' . 
  op is still wrong . 
  only part where member state can not participate is in discussions concerning its own exit deal . 
  it should be able to participate in all other matter , including exit deals of all other members . 
   the guardian of the buildings wait , what ? 
  :d most probably it is going to be coalition , as before , between hdz and most but not right away because most have to pretend that that is n't done deal because of their voters . 
  i believe it is going to be pretty much same unstable situation as before because they need few more seats . 
  it was croatia then , also . 
  but not independent . 
  this metric i like the best !, 
  aaah , that . 
  you did n't quote last line so i thought you overlooked it . 
  you forgot to look at next line . 
  it are n't matter . 
  me always appreciating when someone tries to speaking croatian . 
  one guy is 71 , other is 74 . 
  good luck to them . 
  but , on second thought , their ex colleague from yugoslav secret police is now 96 and just got married . 
  firstly , they were n't extradited because it was unconstitutional before croatia 's accession to the eu . 
  after accession , there was some fuckery done by left-leaning government , but that was sorted out quickly . 
  but it does n't matter which party was in power because other would do the same since one of those guys , perkovi\u0107 , was pretty much involved with them in the ' 90 . 
  secondly , he was n't killed because he wanted independent croatia , he was killed because he unveiled criminal by communist party leaders in oil company . 
  i 'm glad those fuckers are going to rot in jail . 
  but by twisting the facts does n't do any good to anyone . 
  well , iirc , there is square-like area in dubrovnik in front of st. vlaho church . 
  in split there are actually few in town center . 
  inside diocletian 's palace there is [ peristil ] ( http://lidija-photo.com/portfolio/fotografije-grada-splita/split-peristil/split-peristil-022.jpg ) , others are [ pjaca ] ( http://lidija-photo.com/portfolio/fotografije-grada-splita/split-pjaca/split-pjaca-045.jpg ) , [ vo\u0107ni trg ] ( http://lidija-photo.com/portfolio/split/vocni-trg-split-panorama.jpg ) and [ prokurative ] ( http://splitculture.hr/sadrzaj/vijesti/velika/201107141910-4226-prokurative3.jpg ) . 
  he probably means that international treaties are regulated by vienna convention on the law of treaties which has provisions for terminations and withdrawals from treaties .

  [ nsfw ], 
  every time i see such list i imagine how advanced sewer system was in majority of these cities . 
  a version in which croatia is not in eu ? 
  ljubljanica is not only a street , it 's a small neighborhood in tre\u0161njevka . 
   there was the perception that they 're less friendly to immigrants even before brexit . 
  and , more importantly , uk still has restrictions on croatian workers . 
  you must admit , `` franjo tu\u0111man '' just rolls off the tongue . 
  recently he spoke croatian in croatian parliament . 
  croatian and polish are slavic languages , and that certainly helped , but nevertheless it was very good . 
  and it was really nice gesture , same as here . 
  and usa needs to start adhering to rules of austria , belgium , czech republic , denmark , estonia , finland , france , germany , greece , hungary , italy , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , malta , netherlands , poland , portugal , slovakia , slovenia , spain and sweden if they expect to enter them without visa . 
  and their rules are that you ca n't travel without visa to those countries if you impose visa to any of 26 eu countries with common visa policy . 
  its simple as that . 
  and if you had actually read both what you linked and article 265 of tfeu you would see that this is exactly it . 
   article 265  should the european parliament , the european council , the council , the commission or the european central bank , in infringement of the treaties , fail to act , the member states and the other institutions of the union may bring an action before the court of justice of the european union to have the infringement established . 
  this article shall apply , under the same conditions , to bodies , offices and agencies of the union which fail to act . 
   the action shall be admissible only if the institution , body , office or agency concerned has first been called upon to act . 
  if , within two months of being so called upon , the institution , body , office or agency concerned has not defined its position , the action may be brought within a further period of two months . 
  so with this resolution parliament called upon commission .
