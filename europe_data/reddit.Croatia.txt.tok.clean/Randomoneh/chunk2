  come on , brad . 
  you do n't want to side with them dirty _ commies _ , do you now ? 
  _ nah , we just need moar firepower is all _, 
  oh ok , i 'm sure your _ all-out war _ on terrorism will lower the chances of lone wolf attacks . 
  it 's obviously a much better idea . 
  are educated people usually religious ? 
  when people have nothing , know nothing , they turn to god . 
  it 's actually quite simple . 
  all it takes for europe to go through massive terrorism-related mourning is one guy successfully blowing himself up in a crowded place . 
  __ you ca n't end religious terrorism with bullets __ . 
  education , education , education . 
  my taste buds were extremely shocked when they came into contact with us-made hamburger/sandwich/hotdog sauces . 
  i thought i was eating honey . 
  is n't agriculture what they call a * strategic * industry ? 
  maybe it has something to do with that . 
  wow , what a shitty way to thread the chicken and the consumer at the same time . 
  i thought lviv was actually famous for nazi extremism [ then ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lviv_pogroms ) and neonazi extremism since then ? 
  right-wing parties consistently win most of their votes there . 
  thanks . 
  so it 's fresh milk . 
  make sure to drink it all . 
  how long does it last refrigerated ? 
  few days or months ? 
  kako ? 
   0.87 $ fresh milk or uht ? 
  wait , they were n't stopped on their way by police ? 
  farmers tried the same thing in croatia and police stopped them by blocking the roads they were traveling by . 
  what have they done , for whom ? 
  guy read somewhere the amount was too low to get you subsentially high . 
  might be wrong , if so , he 's a a dumbdum . 
  tito replaced by a russian spy . 
  us intelligence behind every major croatian offensive in 90 's war . 
  * being good at politics ? 
  * what are you talking about here ? 
  what is * being good in politics * if not one of these two - making people you represent happy / generating massive wealth for yourself ? 
  it 's not even that . 
  it 's just unethical to own wealth sufficient to keep literally thousands of people well situated for their entire lifetimes . 
  or alternatively , to move tens of thousands permanently out of poverty . 
  oh ok i did n't know . 
  but many are trying their best to present russian gas supply as this super-uncertain thing . 
  for reference , [ this ] ( http://content.satimagingcorp.com/static/galleryimages/satellite_image_auckland_new_zealand_port.jpg ) is a 30 cm image . 
  it if taken from satellite , aerial would look even sharper . 
  are you in trouble ? 
  i have n't noticed . 
  however , i * have * noticed many non-germans are still barely able to survive . 
  what ?!, 
  have you just excused all collaborationists ? 
  it is literally * their job * to get involved . 
  i smile every time when i read about this russian * hybrid war * . 
   they do n't actually expect to get the money back . 
  where in the world did you get this from ? 
  yeah ... * not * inside uk airspace . 
  i do n't support this conspiracy or any conspiracy in advance without any evidence but it 's quite easy to present yourself as x group and claim the responsibility online . 
  maybe against the french silent support of turkey actions ? 
  nato admitted countries with territorial disputes before . 
  nato admitted countries with territorial disputes before . 
  in short - not weaponry suitable for battle with organized state-supported army . 
  any law is basically shifting and fine-tuning benefits - from one interest group to another . 
  trade agreements are no different in this aspect . 
  why would anyone non-biased trust us military as a source of information on russian activities ? 
  that would be like trusting russians on us activities . 
  dumb . 
  it does not . 
   * carpet bombing * aleppo i agree with you but this is just false . 
  how come ? 
  well , you ca n't say his views are n't righteous . 
  i think you have a different definition of what it means to * invade a country * than reasonable people do . 
  it 's a `` flex your muscles '' mentality . 
  incapable of de-escalating , reasoning . 
  * `` you don reason with dem commies !, 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  its been two months and erdogan is the one threatening and doing his best do escalate . 
  could be done with a 3d object representing our continent , seen from the side at 45 \u00b0 . 
  switzerland would definitely be missing . 
  yeah but you ca n't prove it was published because of his fame . 
  you are saying kanye 's opinion on something is probably published because journalist thought this opinion is so good it really deserves a huge audience . 
  if that were the case , same journalist would publish some random guy 's comment once in a while . 
  yet he does n't , does it ? 
  therefore , no we should n't assume celeb 's opinion is published because of metit and just continue to discuss it . 
  if that were true , we 'd see much more submissions with quotes from random reddit users . 
  we do n't , as people more appreciate opinions of the famous . 
  it does n't even matter if they are paid enough of not . 
  if there 's a way to benefit more people , we should change laws to allow for it . 
  that 's great but it proves a challenge to live and work in your countries when rent is so damn high . 
  i 'm guessing many of you either own a home or can afford to rent because you work in different fields than most of the immigrants . 
  something something their blood in our veins something courage something spirit muh history . 
   referendums are not valid on occupied territory where did you get this little gem ? 
  no elections were valid in post-war occupied germany then ? 
  instead of making yourself tired with all the mental gymnastics , just admit you do n't like russians . 
  tell me something . 
  let 's say 30 % of your population speaks only english or finnish . 
  would you give them right to use their language officially ? 
  we have the same kind of people in croatia . 
  * `` croatia for croats !, 
  only croatian , cyrillic not welcome !, 
  you do n't force people that live on certain territory to feel any way . 
  * b-but they enjoy our pensions !, 
  * they 'll gladly enjoy russian equivalent , just ask them . 
  you despise those `` occupiers '' . 
  it 's pretty clear they 'll never have any desire to meet your criteria for being patriots .
