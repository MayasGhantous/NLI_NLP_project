  you still believe majority of crimeans do n't want to be a part of russia ? 
  but we 're goodies an they 're baddies . 
  we do n't need democracy - our leaders can be trusted . 
  democracy is for bad countries . 
  our minorities do n't need a bigger voice , they 're fine . 
  baddies need to give their minorities bigger voice . 
  yeah but crimeans are in dark begging kiev to take them back . 
  quietly , of course , because they are afraid of russians . 
  right ? 
  yup . 
   and it will also provide better trade with russia when things calm down * and they eventually will . 
  * yeah , many are trying to make sure that does n't happen . 
  take a listen at discussions held at us congress or almost anything coming from baltic and polish right . 
  they 'll fucking go ballistic if we ever normalize relations with russia . 
  lol sure ok . we 'll be hearing about krim a lot in next few years , in a positive way . 
  you obviously know next to nothing about krim . 
  it 'll probably be the florida of rf . 
  lol those stupid corrupt russians have no roads like at all amirite guys ? 
  misleading title . 
  they bombed * the station * with damage to the adjacent building housing police and their families . 
  only purpose of all the buildings in the complex is housing ? 
  main building is not a police station is what you 're claiming ? 
  so they attacked the enemy police station and civilians happened to be in the complex or they deliberately targeted civilians , as aljazeera turk article headline suggests ? 
  so they attacked the enemy police station and civilians happened to be in the complex * or * they deliberately targeted civilians , as aljazeera turk article headline suggests ? 
  can you read turkish or you 're just believing the op 's headline ? 
  search for news containing `` pkk '' in the last 24 hours in english or in your preferred language and see there 's a debate over who killed who and blame shifting .

  i also heard some do n't like that we call belarus b ( j ) elorusija . 
  which cases ? 
  you understand the main players benefit in the long term even if it 's them footing the bill ? 
  or to put it another way , presence of russia in some country x is seen as a possible danger and any other scenario is seen as a win . 
  he 's talking about krim there . 
  hm , did n't notice it . 
  it says * libyan * in the follow-up though . 
  you know so little about these countries you have to resort to generalizations like * in africa they ... * or * in middle east they ... * . 
   and syria was a mess long before the west started to bomb the country . 
  it became a mess when arms started to flow in . 
   let 's not even mention the vast amount of war crimes we helped the rebels commit . 
  remember all those haunting videos and photos of sub-saharan africans hauled into trucks ? 
  i 'll never forget those . 
  what was the domestic reaction to not vetoing the un decision ? 
  it 's not smart for every country to borrow at every moment . 
   yeah and the same people that are shouting that overthrowing gaddafi has been a bad idea would have gave the west an hard time if nato did nothing . 
  definitely not the same people . 
   even if the west had n't shipped ak47 to libya , the rebels would n't have had too much difficulty getting some weapons . 
  all those governments have opposition , some moderate , some very extreme and violent . 
  however , coups happen almost exclusively when opposition is encouraged , armed and led by outside country . 
  why has n't there been an armed rebellion of massive scale in saudi arabia or iran in recent years ? 
  well , no foreign entity decided to encourage and arm the opposition . 
  i somehow doubt putin could n't convince medvedev if he wanted to . 
  my guess is , aside from few infrastructural and arm deals , russia did n't have very much to gain from libya one way or another so as sign of good relations with france chose to look away and not get involved . 
  they thought they had more to gain from good relations with france than from good relations with gaddafi . 
  source is us government , hosted on webpage dedicated to freedom of information act related files . 
   ( and especially hurts europe ) , which is also their goal . 
  you have to be careful with these easy , broad , black and white conclusions . 
  while there is some level of competition between various us and europe 's oil companies and financial institutions , they are mostly on the same page when it comes to foreign resources . 
  libyan economy distancing itself and encouraging other african nations to distance themselves from us&uk ( `` western '' ) institutions leading to massive propaganda campaign followed by nato attack and murder of head of state - muammar gaddafi . 
  consequences for libya : relatively prosperous ( compared to other african countries ) nation with very left-leaning , social policies of education , housing , medical care now in state of constant war between various islamist and * sell-everything-to-westerners-and-bring-mcdonalds-to-us * factions . 
  standard of living falling drastically , population measurably worse than pre-2011 . 
  oh and by the way - fuck you russia and china , for not vetoing the decision . 
  hate speech is illegal only on paper . 
  hate speech directed at perceived `` haters '' , for example , is not illegal and is seen as positive . 
  yeah , russia is totally irrelevant . 
  nah , it usually stays for a week . 
  more if another storm comes by and if it 's below 0 . 
  this is the most popular video of zagreb under heavy snow ( 2012 ) . 
  [ ** winter in zagreb ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6yvhvu4fc0 ) really worth watching . 
  dubrava , at the east ( northeast ? ), 
  of the city was built in socialism too . 
  yet , it 's much prettier than anything south of the sava river imho . 
  well , communism definitely did n't slow down progress in area of multi-cultural relations . 
   fully ** 80 % ** of russians have never travelled outside the former soviet union yet , in 2014 , ** 59 % ** participants said they 've never traveled outside former soviet union . 
   and only ** 5 % ** speak a foreign language at conversational level . 
  yet , in 2014 , ** 16 % ** participants said they fluently speak at least one foreign language . 
  do n't know about yalta ? 
  artek children camp ? 
  do n't you watch movies bro ? 
  just to give people the perspective , that 's like ** 3 ** whole minimum monthly wages . 
  airbus also had more orders than boeing in 2015 . 
  do n't push for those rotten resolutions in the first place . 
  you have no business turning secular dictatorships into pseudo-democratic chaos . 
  no way . 
  yeah ... about that . 
  nuclear states do n't do that to each other . 
  are those much higher than general minimum wage ? 
  he told you before , people will know he 's sincere even without the tag . 
  true , but there are generally two reasons why people refuse to vaccinate . 
  '' * i 'll get sick because of it !, 
  * '' and '' * no big government will tell me what to do ! * '' . 
  while you 'll find the first case both with republicans and hippie-types , second is limited to republicans . 
  article says preparations are in motion for transfer to be done in ** 2016 ** . 
  come on , norwegians , you can still win this one !, 
  thanks for the terms . 
  can you explain this part :  the notion that linguistic socialization into a speech community lies at the heart of lado has been argued for by linguists since 2004 , and is now accepted by a range of government agencies ( e.g. 
  switzerland , norway ), 
  please provide any source on these good practices for determination of origin . 
  i 'm being serious , ca n't find anything at all . 
  i demand a state-wide referendum for the sake of belgium 's territorial integrity !, 
  that 's the only way secession/accession can be done in civilized world !,
