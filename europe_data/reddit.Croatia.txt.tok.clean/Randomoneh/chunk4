  because territorial integrity . 
   turkey does n't see greece as an enemy turkey officially has n't seen russia as an enemy either . 
  being in nato does n't mean you share your foreign policy or airspace . 
  i wo n't go into whether shooting down russian jet was in line with turkey 's foreign policy . 
  i 'll just say that i would n't be surprised if these flyovers damage relations between greece and turkey , even though they are part of the same alliance . 
  you might be able to tell , no problem there . 
  but currently there is nothing to back up claims that anything of the sorts is being done in any of eu countries to determine the status of applicants . 
  and how was this citizenship status determined ? 
  you guys are sure none of the documents are forged ? 
  no , but seriously , should n't identification be done through fingerprint records stored in morocco ? 
   the russian do not give a shit , will sell to anyone paying them ... nato countries do n't get to buy the most recent versions of their weapons . 
  so what you 're saying is that even though * on paper * turkey and russia fight against the same enemy in syria - in practice they have different goals . 
  how is that different from greece-turkey relation ? 
  yeah , they are both in nato . 
  it does n't mean that they do n't have different goals in reality . 
  people take this greece-turkey alliance through nato for granted . 
  alliances break , sometimes spectacularly . 
  just look at recent saudi-pakistan relations . 
  how about facts instead ? 
  no can do ? 
   we are planning to build a permanent base on the moon by 2015 and by 2020 we can begin the industrial-scale delivery ... of the rare isotope helium-3 ... - * nikolay sevastianov , head of energia * and an analysis :  the first thing an observer must notice about this chorus of bold moon talk is its source . 
  sevastianov and other experts are first and foremost spaceship ** salesmen ** , not spaceship buyers . 
  what they are announcing is their willingness to carry out the described mission , if somebody else steps up and pays for it . 
   an associated press story prudently pointed out that `` sevastianov 's statement appeared to be part of energia 's publicity campaign aimed at ** attracting government funding ** for the development of a next-generation spacecraft . '', 
  tell that to your farmers . 
  and they have n't shot themselves in the foot ? 
  pretty much any political analyst will tell you that damage heavily outweighs any hypothetical benefits . 
  now do * peace * . 
  `` russia '' is n't seeping into latvia . 
  word * vojna * is . 
  and if op was pedantic enough , he could 've colored parts of some other countries same ( estonia , for example ) . 
  i 'm pretty sure * proto * - slavic outslavs slavic . 
  i asked specifically about  russian-us joint projects [ which no longer ] can get funding from western banks you failed to reveal which projects those are , then brought up an example of eu company not being able to ** sell ** to russia . 
  belarus has significantly higher hdi than moldova , 4x higher gdp per capita . 
  such a luxurious item , the doormat . 
  we have that in the form of * prozra\u010diti * or * proluftati * . 
  done in the morning before heating the house as it makes no sense to heat it up first , let the warm air out , then heat it again . 
  what that has to do with russian - ** us ** projects ** funded by us money ** ? 
  abso-lutely nothing . 
  it 's funny how some groups can advocate for sovereignty ( `` no eu !, 
  no usa !, 
  no soviet union !, 
  no yugoslavia ! '' ), 
  and at the same time fight for `` territorial integrity '' . 
  what is this territorial integrity you speak of ? 
  has it to do with cultures or citizenship ? 
  history or justice ? 
   the sanctions in the finance sector have hit hard , though . 
  basically , almost no russian-eu or russian-us joint projects can get funding from western banks . 
  paraphrasing - there were russia-us projects that would benefit russia , funded by us loans that suddenly ca n't be realized . 
  i find no evidence that `` drilling in the arctic '' is a project which falls under all of these categories . 
  * progress * encompasses more than just better recognition of sexual conditions . 
  therefore ,  no * x * = no progress is simply not true . 
  right of cultures to self-determination means nothing to you . 
  two can play that game . 
   russian-us joint projects funded by us banks projects such as ? 
   i can see putin spinning this and blaming the economy not on oil prices , but on how the eu is trying to destroy russia . 
  completely wrong . 
  go watch the annual address , vladimir says previous plans were made with certain oil pricea in mind and how things have changed completely for them because of this . 
  til  no [ lgbtqqiaap ] ( http://www.google.com/search?q=lgbtqqiaap ) adoption of children = no societal progress . 
  ok . just so you know , we did it in the middle of ethnic conflict , contrary to the constitution , with no meaningful * pros & cons * debate . 
  but , but , but russians ... 
  you would have recognized the secession of croatia & slovenia then ? 
  you what ? 
  you would n't recognize slovenia or croatia back then ? 
  what is alaska ? 
   and they had no chance at self-determination seeing as the vote was ~ 98 % in favour , something that never happens and is indicative of a faked vote . 
  96 % , polls done in crimea by multiple organizations confirmed support for secession . 
  what 's your point ? 
  * `` i do n't like it so i 'll dispute it on technicalities . 
  '' *  it should have been done a few months or a year later so an actual advertisement of the benefits and cons no country in yugoslavia separated with * pros & cons * free discussion yet every country was internationally recognized . 
  if it is not consensual ( kiev forbids with threat of force ) , how can it be done any other way ? 
  would you say all elections & referendums under `` occupation '' are non-valid : iraqi elections , west germany elections after ww2 ? 
  military presence , not force of arms . 
  plus , what was the alternative ? 
  what would have been the `` proper '' way of self-determinating ? 
  separation could n't have been done any other way when you have the central government imposing ban on separation through * real * force of arms . 
  it was separation , then accession . 
  was it not , though ? 
   ~ ~ annexation ~ ~ accession, 
  important part :  montenegro has opted for membership in eu and nato , but also for open conflicts and misunderstandings __ with everyone __ with whom these organizations are in conflict - that is , for __ membership without identity and autonomy __ , '', 
  ever ? 
  wow , that 's retarded . 
  if what you say is true , ground troops in full force would be fighting rebels in syria and kiev government in ukraine . 
  that 's what  seemingly willing to lose nearly anything means . 
  what do you think results of a poll like this one would be in poland ? 
   about which movement you feel most negative about ? 
   - national socialist  - communist  - same  - do n't know / do n't care, 
  what you described is not really ee-only thing . 
  shut your filthy mouth !, 
  only ex-commie countries have these kind of buildings . 
  now seriously , the only reason these look ugly is because of dirty facade and balcony/window modifications . 
  by extent , you could say the same for majority of nations today , including rf . 
  i would n't say odd things , though . 
  do n't worry . 
  people knowledgeable of the matter know russian science used to be top notch , not shit . 
  let 's go point by point . 
   pravda claimed black box data proves no violation what pravda writes in linked article :  the analysis of the data of flight recorders of the downed russian su-24 will be conducted openly . 
  first data of the decoding of the su-24 flight recorders will be exposed on monday , december 21 at the session of the interstate aviation committee . 
  no , christianity incorporated the most important rituals .
