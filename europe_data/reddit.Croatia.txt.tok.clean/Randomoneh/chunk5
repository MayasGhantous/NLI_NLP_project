  found it . 
  it 's not as hopeless as your map suggests . 
   adoption  affects no one huh , what ? 
  do you ? 
  that 's insane , was there a long public debate on adoption thingy ? 
  you have percentages for every region , on a map ? 
   it 's an attempt to disguise a foreign policy issue as an internal regulation issue . 
  so this behavious is not limited to russia in any way . 
  you have some similar to this ( political , large format , color , detailed ) ? 
  anything other than distant past , that is ( berlin wall , communism ... ) . 
  why are you crying ? 
  this is what r/europe is now and there 's nothing you or anyone else can do about it . 
  they need good villains . 
  eventually , they 'll get tired and move to something else . 
  nuclear , space technology is excluded , am i right ? 
  will law force churches to marry the couples ? 
  also , does this include adoption or not ? 
  how can catholic church be the original church when half of their teachings are based on later pagan symbolism ? 
  admit it , you commie trash - uncle putler sent you those banners , did n't he ? 
  seriously ? 
  [ our principles ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3xd7kt/what_values_should_countries_in_europe_uphold/cy3okqs ), 
  oh yeah , they 've been destroying it since 90 's , all right !, 
  involvement in foreign affairs strictly limited to technological help & aid in case of countries friendly to our principles ( this list is what our * principles * are ) , limited only to some civilian aid in case of countries non-friendly to out principles . 
  main domestic goal - prosperity for every single citizen , whether achieved through democracy or some other form of governance . 
  sustainable population growth , ownership of land limited to reasonable amount . 
  ah , what do you know anyway ? 
  i 'll trust jamie from usa on matters related to russians , thank you very much . 
  what ? 
  where ? 
  russian government subsidized ukraine * heavily * year after year just to keep them out of eu/nato . 
  who said anything about russian - * speaking * ukrainians ? 
  i was talking about ukrainian citizens who identify with russia more than they do with ukraine . 
   with which of the following opinions on russia 's support of donbass militias do you most agree ? 
  russian troops present , we should acknowledge it - ** 11 % ** i have no idea - ** 16 % ** no russians troops in ukraine - ** 37 % ** probably , but under current international situation , we should deny - ** 38 % **, 
  i swear i saw the same poll you 're writing about , just with completely different results . 
  i ca n't find it now , can you give me the source ? 
  in some cases , you have to take someone by the shoulders and shake them . 
  this is the equivalent of this . 
  `` no - violent islamism is not some vague political movement with misguided goals . 
  this is what it is . 
  this is what it does . '', 
  that 's so simplified , it 's like saying `` see ? 
  islamic state is a state and france is a state . 
  we are n't so different after all , are we ? '', 
  moderate nationalists seeks non-intervention ( what you incorrectly call `` isolation '' ) , violent islamic groups seek expansion . 
  exactly the opposite . 
  you have to be more direct - * putler gave me less rubles this month for shilling . 
  with sancion-crisis and low wage , i ca n't afford vodka and that 's why i 'm being rude to you . 
  separation or autonomy , those people identify more as russians then as ukrainians . 
  if push comes to shove , they 'll side with russia . 
  it did , they did . 
  i 'm a joke for not ignoring that huge amounts of people in almost every country in on this earth that would side with neighboring country if war between the two would brake out . 
  we call them _ minorities _ . 
  only in some countries , they are n't so minor . 
  russia had and still has huge support in southeast ukraine . 
  those people identify more with russia than they do with ukraine . 
  and those people exist everywhere . 
  how many texans would defend their state from central government in case of war ? 
  how many serbs in eastern croatia / northern bosnia ? 
  iranians in eastern iraq ? 
  kurds in east turkey ? 
  check any previous elections in ukraine . 
  parliamentary or presidential . 
  division is clear and not marginal . 
  you 're acting like military installations were kept out of those regions . 
  you think people from those regions who were serving in the ukrainian army prior to the coup kept their loyalty to kiev ? 
  do n't be ridiculous . 
  every powerful military nation has spies in its neighboring nations . 
  now consider the fact that pro-russia movement is strong in eastern ukraine and you 'll understand that , except for training personnel and weapons , there is/was no need for ** large ** amount of russian _ ground forces _ to be there . 
  and still , some keep insisting the only reason separatists are able to keep positions in east ukraine is because of that huge russian army fighting their battles . 
  haha, 
  ca n't answer ? 
  fuck off then . 
  ah , there we are . 
  false claims from op : 2 out of 2 . 
  go and read two of my questions again . 
  i 'm not asking you about isolated cases . 
  is there or is there not a total ban on turkish companies doing business / turkish citizens traveling to russia ? 
  so no turkish company is doing business in russia in this moment ? 
  there are no turkish citizens in russia as they are arrested and deported to turkey ? 
  because , that 's what  they banned turks from working in russia , they sent turkish tourists back as well . 
  means . 
  aside from ( maybe ) isolated cases , i bet you 5 $ you ca n't prove any of it . 
  serious source for any of those claims ? 
  usually that 's how it works , yeah . 
  or milk or fruit-related . 
  prices of butter , cheese and milk here fell so hard after sanctions and are still at those levels . 
   ... the internet was an american invention , they also still have control of it and ( ... ) can actually force any country top level domain to be censored or disconnected . 
  for me that 's , a really broken design . 
  and  we have never seen this amount of centralization , extreme inequality , extreme capitalism in any system before . 
  but according to the marketing done by people like mark zuckerberg and companies like google , it 's all to help with the open network and to spread democracy , and so on . 
  at the same time , they are capitalistic monopolies . 
  so it 's like trusting the enemy to do the good deeds . 
  it is really bizarre . 
  if someone wrote this here in r/europe , he 'd be downvoted to hell . 
  they might be doing a `` good job '' but what happens when you have a lousy judicial system is that people spend years in custody , only to be released in the absence of evidence . 
  you would n't understand . 
   hungarians ethnically are not even slavs none of the groups in hungary share majority of dna info with slavs ? 
  that 's what you 're claiming ? 
  good film usually has great photographic qualities .
