tbh , unlike some , croatian police was n't beating up the migrants ...

  aw , now i feel bad for albaniaball :(, 
  i also did n't watch hetalia , so maybe the `` naze p\u014drando baka '' was n't about that , because when i clicked image search on japanese google it showed polandball comics ... 
  problem is , that 's nicole austin xd, 
  ^ influence of us capitalism, 
  dunno if they know where he 's from , but they do know about him . 
  google `` shigatsu wa kimi no uso '' , it 's really good and it features chopin 's music and they mention him a few times . 
  huh , cool . 
  i must say i find most of our literature quite boring . 
  in my experience , the main character either kills someone , dies or commits suicide in the end ( e.g. 
  bijeg , u registraturi , ... ) becomes repetitive after a while ... 
  your standards are n't very high , are they ? 
  when the hell was that f5/f6 black spot tornado south of sisak ? 
  never heard of it, 
  i think it may be sturdy head = tvrda glava = tvrdoglav = stubborn, 
  we 're really riding on nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 zrinski ... https://hr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/vazetje_sigeta_grada, 
  it 's not really an * epic * ^ ( as in awesome ) poem / jk, 
  is hoxha the guy who built bunkers ? 
  albania had a dictator who liked to build bunkers , i think ? 
  they 're the best http://news-bar.hr/vijesti/svijet/bombasha-samoubojicu-u-raju-dochekala-72-djevca-iz-anonimusa but i also like when they post their `` news '' to facebook and people do n't understand it 's satire and start raging in the comments xd, 
  pretty much, 
  [ citation needed ], 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/major_histocompatibility_complex that is all . 
  also , dora peja\u010devi\u0107 - https://youtu.be/svhhb1_mw_a this one https://youtu.be/b2daezlgddc reminds me of your lie in april, 
  yeah , medical advances are basically the problem along with the senilization of the population , because in the past old people would n't live as long so the pension model was sustainable . 
  so the problem could be solved not by increasing the taxable workforce but by lowering the number of old people who receive the pensions ( even though i 'm not for that because it 's kinda a bastard move to screw over people who 've been working their entire life for the pension ), 
  i completely understand the issue , but the difference is that sweden is trying to use the immigrants as a workforce and a future source of taxation to get the money for pensions . 
  the problem is this solution is temporary and will only increase when the immigrants reach retirement age and want their own pensions . 
  damn it, 
  hipsterrorists, 
  actually , i read that some raf members were arrested last year trying to rob a lorry or something ? 
  do n't quote me on this, 
  supposedly gibraltar can hold a referendum to stay in the eu even if uk leaves ... 
  is n't irish the official language in ireland ? 
  as their prime minister is called taiyoseach or something ? 
  i thought husby and rinkeby were the no-go zones ? 
  there 's a lot of fearmongering in this subreddit ( downvotes incoming ! ), 
  so the us , as a comfortable , developed nation , is weak ? 
  so sweden is xenophobic like japan and distrusts foreigners ? 
  so , is this incorrect ? 
  my subjective opinion has no influence on objective facts , and that is that croatia as a catholic nation is quite homophobic . 
  if you 're not satisfied with a link from 2012 , here 's one from 2013 http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/04/croatia-gay-marriage-vote-europe-rotten-heart and i have heard of instances when gay couples were attacked in zagreb because some football hooligans saw them holding hands/kissing . 
  i still like carr, 
  touch\u00e9, 
   no one has suggested gay sex should be [ ... ] punished by death the angry mob did . 
  and just to be clear , i support lgbt rights and condemn any form of violence towards the population . 
  that homophobic people not shy of violence still exist in eastern europe, 
  http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/croatian-city-split-divided-over-gay-pride-after-violent-clashes310512/#gs.g_cvbta and some academic professors accused the police of defending the gay pride instead of saving antonija bili\u0107 , which was impossible at the time because paravinja already killed her . 
  and when boris de\u017eulovi\u0107 , an award-winning reporter , called them out on their bull **** , he got fired from slobodna dalmacija . 
  do you live in split ? 
   implying hungarian politicians are manly muscular macho guys, 
  are you reffering to police having to protect the gay pride in split so that an angry mob does n't lynch them or to the fact that the position of women in our society was described by mp kova\u010devi\u0107 as `` a woman is not fit to be wise , but she 's fit to be on a mattress '' ? 
  a few years ago an old-school chief of neurosurgery in one of more famous hospitals said `` while i 'm in charge , no woman will be a neurosurgeon '' . 
  i think one other hospital just got a first female neurosurgeon a few weeks ago . 
  so , a large portion of society here still thinks men should work and women should be housewives ... one of the mps even said `` nije \u017eena za mudraca nego za madraca '' ( a woman 's not fit to be a wise-man , but she is fit for a mattress ( i.e. 
  making babies ) ) compared to the west , it 's depressing really . 
  and then we are confused how our economy is stagnating when we could potentially employ women which make 50 % of the workforce ... 
  yeah , that older yugonostalgic generation in their 20s . 
  most of my friends are in their early 20s and most of them say things were better in yugoslavia . 
  yes , but he was against stalin and arrested people who openly supported stalin . 
  and communism as an idea is n't that bad , it 's just very difficult if not impossible to put into practice ( a clasless society where everyone has what they need and there is no `` 1 % '' ) . 
  the opposite of communism is capitalism and capitalism and privatisation f-ed up croatia after the homeland war . 
  that 's why nowadays we have people who survive by gathering plastic bottles from trash cans and return them for a few cents ( 50 lipa ) / bottle . 
  to elaborate , most of the australian emigration from croatia happened when ustashe collaborators were fleeing persecution after ww2 so they taught their children how the `` independent state '' of croatia was the god 's greatest gift to croats ... 
  then the prices of cars would become higher . 
  i think the eu gives some kind of discount to other members . 
   lies about what happened in the wars i kinda think when australian croatian expats think they know what happened in the wars better than us croats do , that that 's hilarious . 
  and just a smidge depressing . 
  doubt it . 
  in eastern europe people usually ca n't build their way up to the top without family/friend ties in the company . 
  our system is quite corrupt, 
  import tarrifs . 
  also if you 're ordering online from the eu , the shipping is more expensive, 
  i wonder if uk actually leaves will they have to pay more money for eu-imported goods ? 
  cars , for example , most come from germany so the prices will go up , right ? 
  you have a point , but i 'm just gon na write one more thing - you said `` we should oppose the government if it 's wrong '' . 
  but do you see the problem in this ? 
  who decides on what is wrong ? 
  the people ? 
  but what if the people disagree on the problem ( say , abortion ) ? 
  the majority ? 
  okay , but 2/3 majority or 50 % +1 majority ? 
  see why this issue is problematic ? 
  also , if a minority is convinced us government is doing the wrong thing and follows the declaration of independence ( that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness . 
  prudence , indeed , will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed . 
  but when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government , and to provide new guards for their future security . 
  ) , for something they consider not to be `` light and transient '' ( say , life of a fetus ) , does that give them the right to overthrow the government or would that be treason ? 
  you 're saying we should oppose the government if it 's in the wrong , saying how the government not collecting information about religion and languages is wrong . 
  but if the government collects that information and it is then used to discriminate against minorities , what happens then ? 
  and it 's probably due to inherent values between eu and the us , but in , for example , germany , you could n't do and yell a nazi salute because it 's illegal , regardless of freedom of speech . 
  and also , there is another problem ( this is an extremely difficult issue ) - croatia has a law how if a minority has over a certain percent of population in a city , then public institutions need to have written signs in both languages - however , in vukovar , which has a large serbian minority , and which was occupied by serbian forces in a war 20 years ago , there should , by law , be bilingual official signs . 
  and when the government started putting up public institution signs on the buildings , nationalists started tearing down the signs with hammers in large mobs . 
  so , who is at fault here , the law , the government , the people ? 
  is discrimination off-limits or are you for implementation of it ? 
  yeah , mr. cameron was more interested in pork when he was 16 ... 
  yes , but if prostitution were legal , prostitutes would have access to healthcare and could go to police if something happened to them . 
  we also have the requisite evidence to conclude that he incited the crimes charged in the indictment ( with the exception of plunder ) through all of his inflammatory speeches , calling clearly and directly for the expulsion and forcible transfer of the non-serbs , in addition to his speeches in which he denigrated and dehumanized the croats comparing them to `` primates '' and `` vampires '' and qualifying them as cowards . 
  in the same way , he called the bosnian muslims `` balija '' or `` pogani '' which he himself translated as `` excrements '' . 
  i hold that the use of these terms , together with his constant references to `` genocide '' committed by the croats during world war two and the saying `` an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth '' and `` revenge is blind '' , vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj also took the risk that murder , torture , cruel treatment and destruction would be committed in furtherance of the common criminal purpose he shared with the other leaders in the former yugoslavia who participated in the jce , the purpose of which was to force through the perpetration of crimes , the non-serbs to leave the territories claimed by the serb forces .
