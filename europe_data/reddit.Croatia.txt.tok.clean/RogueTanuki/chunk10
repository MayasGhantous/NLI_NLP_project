  also , if bosnia would actually build the a1 highway , you 'd be there in half the time : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a1_ ( bosnia_and_herzegovina ) croatia has a lot of nice cities , one of my favourites is rovinj , i think it looks awesome on a peninsula . 
  but dalmatia is also great because there 's access to many national parks such as krka and paklenica . 
  problem is when tourists do n't get informed and then we get news like `` czech tourists rescued/died after going on an evening climb on mt.

  nah , i do n't think there 's much animosity there .

  yeah , we 'll have to see if this turkey deal will help in the long run . 
  hopefully the entire ordeal wo n't repeat itself this year ... 
  slovenian what ? 
  land area ? 
   if by dividing you mean sending a train unannounced to hungary or randomly dumping them at the slovenian border at night , yeah , totally . 
  i 'm sorry , we did n't just randomly dump them at night . 
  we randomly dumped them during the day , too xd but if i remember correctly , did n't orban use the same tactic when austria deported them back to hungary ? 
  like , release them near austrian border and say `` now , behave nicely and do n't try to cross the austrian border which is 5 min away * in that direction * '' also , my bad , thought the czech republic was more south than it is . 
  i do n't feel like arguing about nationalistic matters , but thanks for the suggestion . 
  seeing your flair i rememberd this http://uk.businessinsider.com/thousands-of-refugees-are-fleeing-finland-some-of-them-think-its-just-too-cold-2016-2 xd, 
   redirect a part of refugees to croatia , austria , czechia , slovakia  because those countries would had totally accepted them ... why did n't croatia do that ? 
  not sure if you remember your geography , but unlike hungary , croatia does n't share a land border with those eu members . 
  and croatia did , afaik , divide the mob towards slovenia and hungary , the two eu members it has borders with . 
  not sure if i would agree with you , croatian nationalists usually do , but croats also have a good memory of history when it comes to helping refugees such as refugees from vukovar because the people who failed to escape the city were taken from the hospital and massacred - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vukovar_massacre but nevermind that . 
  it 's your choice if you have empathy or humanity and other `` christian values '' or not . 
  i 'm not even religious , but i have those qualities , because those are inherently human qualities . 
  and if there was a better discussion and planning between eu members , we could have avoided building walls and accusing each other . 
  but , alas , it seems you prefer to be salty and xenophobic . 
  as is your right . 
  if this does n't get at least -10 downvotes , i 'll be disappointed . 
  come on , people !, 
  i do n't really care about our government , but the thing is , if instead of the money you used to build kilometers and kilometers of fence you used that money to build sorting centres , the entire load would have been ameliorated . 
  that 's how dividing works , makes big problems easier by dividing them so that they 're easier to solve . 
  redirect a part of refugees to croatia , austria , czechia , slovakia , divide the mob so it 's easier to process and sort . 
   celebrities i know a lot of british celebrities , but i ca n't for the likes of me remember who john cleese is xd, 
  umm , our prime minister said we were ready to receive several thousand immigrants , and we were - not several tens of thousands . 
  also , hungary is bigger than croatia and has a stronger economy , so technically the best option should have been to separate the refugees proportionally to the capabilities of each country , not to pull a trump and build big f ****** walls . 
   yes , when they are on outside borders , not when you decide to say `` fuck you '' to your surrounding countries because that did jack shit . 
  weeb used translate . 
  it 's super effective !, 
  speaking of tanks , what 's up with our m-95 degman ? 
  are we even manufacturing those ? 
  the language looks like hungarian , can turks understand hungarian and vice versa ? 
  german economy after turkey 's sanctions : http://img.pandawhale.com/post-38275-community-troy-walks-in-on-dis-gixb.gif / s, 
  that moment when you can read japanese xd, 
  yeah , because croatia is an economic tiger of the balkans , famed for its economy ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  * niko_007 used godwin 's law . 
  * * it does n't affect foe croatia ... *,

  `` pornographic connotations '' here being haruki murakami 's books in * high school * curriculum ? 
  i see what you 're saying , but if i remember correctly , the constitution of yugoslavia allowed member states to secede if there was a referendum on it . 
  so , democratically , croatia had the right to declare independence . 
  now , nationalism is a whole different matter . 
  croatian nationalists are mostly uneducated idiots and i really do n't get the hype behind being nationalist , maybe because my field is biomedical science so i kinda try not to discriminate against people . 
  but since yugoslavia was a federation , did n't its constitution allow for every member state to secede ? 
  and when croatia had a public majority vote for secession , why did milosevic try to use military force to keep croatia a member state of yugoslavia ? 
  ( not saying yugoslavia was bad as an idea , but it failed in practice ), 
  you obviously have n't been on croatian news website facebook pages such as index , jutarnji , ve\u010dernji . 
  if it 's not `` yugochetnik commies '' , then it 's u.s.a. 's ( and possibly monsanto 's ) fault ... 
  conspiracy theorists ... 
  conspiracy theorists everywhere . 
  local news source : http://m.dnevnik.hr/clanak/vijesti/hrvatska/kurikularna-reforma-prosvjed-pocinje-u-18-sati-diljem-hrvatske---439041.html it was really a huge gathering for secularization and better education . 
  this is n't one piece, 
  serious sam and the talos principle, 
  also , 1891 : fingerprinting . 
  ivan vu\u010deti\u0107 ( 1858 -- 1925 ) was a criminalist who emigrated to argentina in 1884 , where he was employed in the police force . 
  he was one of the founders of dactyloscopy and invented a system for classifying fingerprints which he applied in solving criminal cases . 
  1904 : the tungsten light bulb . 
  the chemist and metallurgist franjo hanaman ( 1878 -- 1941 ) developed a process for manufacturing tungsten filaments and their application in electric light bulbs , with alexander just , in vienna . 
  and in 1981 antibiotic azythromycin , one of the more widely used antibiotics . 
  was n't insulin invented at boston university ? 
  i vaguely remember hearing about year on 1st year of med school, 
  knew about papanikolaou . 
  but i 'm in med school so it does n't count . 
  we learned leeuwenhoek invented the microscope , too . 
  he microscoped his own semen . 
  reminds me of that article from last year which said europe 's antisemitism reached unprecedented levels . 
  like , really ? 
  unprecedented ? 
  `` so how do you say that in serbo-croatian ? '', 
  why ? 
  spaghetti bolognaise is great with ketchup !, 
  tesla is a serb . 
  we agree to disagree . 
  in us ... and germany - https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/kaukasische_rasse, 
  she sung like that on purpose , look at her previous performances , she decided to sing the song differently every time . 
  and , imo australia should 've won . 
  ukraine 's song is boring and most of the songs were aimed at horny teenage girls ( russia , hungary , uk , ... ), 
  they have a new album , it 's awesome, 
  putin 's gon na put the eurovision in russia, 
  maybe croatia did n't deserve top 15 ( despite my opinion that it did ) , but it surely did n't deserve to be 4th one from the bottom . 
  our song was too good for that . 
  i think that 's maybe a message that we should stop competing , this contest became too political anyway ...
