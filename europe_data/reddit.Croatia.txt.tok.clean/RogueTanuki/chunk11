  * oomph !, 
  now putin 's gon na invade ukraine so we 'll have eurovision in russia again next year xd, 
  i think they have beaches - on the danube, 
  they do n't really have that right when previous songs ( quality material such as moja \u0161tikla / s ) made by our own composers did n't even qualify for the finals . 
  one of the first things that popped up when i googled it xd http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/glaswegian-accent-is-britains-sexiest-say-americans/, 
  yeah , i know , kavkaz , but it 's still weird how we used a singlw geographic term to refer to all white people ... 
  caucasians is another term for white people https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caucasian_race, 
  i almost had a seizure watching them, 
  and israel is europe ? 
  i 'm against that . 
  we already have international folklore festival and that 's the place for tamburica and such stuff . 
  is that something like a chav ? 
  i think we 'll be lucky to make it to top 15 , the competition is really strong this year : /, 
  uk probably, 
  it 's on saturday . 
  and even on weekdays i usually stay up till 1:30 and wake up at 7:30 . 
  though , i 'm in med school so my sleeping schedule is shit . 
  well , croatia has a crazy dress , 
  after a long line of sh * t we sent to eurovision , we finally sent something good xd i just hope we 're in top 10-15 , it 's been a long time since we were successful , and the society of croatian composers was against nina for singing a song in english and they said terrible things to her in the media , so i hope she shows them by getting a good spot in the finals . 
  they 're kinda hypocrites because they never got such good results as she did and they still criticise her . 
  but maybe you 'll win barbara dex ? 
  do n't be a conspiracy nut , kid . 
  that was n't recent . 
  now , please stay on topic . 
  this is a thread about eurovision . 
  bosnia reminded me of turbo-folk a bit , and i hate turbo-folk music . 
  but yeah , i agree we should send bands such as [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_ad11sgsm ) , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0btkk5rywk ) or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlt2kvasm3i ), 
  i 'm sorry , but i find all of this hard to believe , and like it 's trying to play my emotions . 
  if a parent is so poor that he/she can not feed or provide for their children , then i agree that it is the state 's duty to put that child in a foster care . 
  that happens in every developed country , not just in sweden . 
  and if there was something illegal in all of this , then the european court of human rights would settle it . 
  i see no problem in this . 
  everybody who qualified for the finals ( except for azerbaijan , they had a good song but the singer failed several times ) + iceland, 
  whatever dude , this is getting boring, 
  i 'm asking for the citation to the information written in your citation, 
  here 's the explanation : https://youtu.be/dqw4w9wgxcq, 
  aha , but you see , i 'm not mentioning they are the same language , i 'm asking why they * are n't * . 
  [ citation needed ] for now , this seems like some sort of a bull $ hit conspiracy theory, 
  if a patient tells me he practices chemsex : http://i.imgur.com/tnqrx6v.gif?noredirect, 
  yes , croatia is nowadays one of the most gay friendly countries on the planet . 
  if you 're a gay couple and you see big , bald guys on the street , you should kiss and they 'll start clapping because of the beauty of your love ^ itwasajokedo n'tdothat http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lwm-brqwdx0/tw4kvmvgpli/aaaaaaaaal0/iifbmeae0mo/s179/afro-shaking-head-no.gif, 
  croatia , for example . 
  which somehow ranked higher on this list than sweden ? 
  how in the ... 
  wtf is `` chemsex '' ? 
  yeah , each child gets 150 $ per month from the state . 
  * the horror !, 
  * https://sweden.se/society/10-things-that-make-sweden-family-friendly/ come to croatia to see what it a terrible welfare system , because sweden definitely is n't . 
  i likey cyprus and prefer rock music , but the song just reminds me so much of : https://youtu.be/6ohjvrgvyqc, 
  yup , there are good songs regardless of whether you understand the lyrics or not : https://youtu.be/h3vt6r0cfd8, 
  but you see , i 'm from croatia and i hate klapa music . 
  i prefer rock and alternative and bands like one ok rock , oomph or fall out boy . 
  eurovision is n't the international folklore festival and should n't be regarded as such . 
  the beginning of belgium sounds a bit like https://youtu.be/3jz4pnntyxq, 
  are you kidding ? 
  there are several awesome songs this year, 
  austrian singer is beautiful . 
  hard to believe she 's 19, 
   there were some people who were extremely obese maybe it 's cushing 's syndrome ? 
  how ? 
  i 'm genuinly interested . 
  afaik kanji is used to distinguish between homonyms which would be hard to distinguish if written in hiragana . 
  \u304b\u307f : \u9aea , \u7d19 , \u795e and hiragana is used to distinguish grammar in verb endings and such things, 
  i guess it could be different dialects , but in that case the serbian dialect , afaik , is n't used in croatia because they use ekavica , whereas croatian dialect uses ijekavica ( e.g. 
  iceland was my favourite , but i think people punished her for having a performance which was a bit similar to loreen . 
  but everyone i know says that iceland should have qualified instead of azerbaijan . 
  and someone commented how the guy from estonia looks like a serial killer from den som dr\u00e6ber xd, 
  but is n't that , the language border being politically shaped , the exact reason people claim croatian and serbian are two different languages ? 
  ( let 's see if i can beat my record of 20 dislikes :p ), 
  i think you can if you include the on ` yomi or kun ` yomi readings ( not sure which ) , but that would be hellishly difficult to read, 
  go fuck yourself . 
  well , in my opinion , if you say that if some languages are intelligible they should be the same language , and that due to that reason croatian and serbian are the same language , then swedish and norwegian or swedish and danish should be the same language . 
  would it make things easier ? 
  maybe . 
  but actually when i think about it , i do n't really care . 
  i honesty do n't give one flying f * $ k about the language i speak since that 's basically just us humans trying to name a set of sounds we make and it does n't affect me in everyday life , since i 'm in natural sciences , not social sciences . 
  so , good night . 
  * my , how polite and charming . 
  * you must be * popular * with the ladies . 
  or sroatian, 
  not quite . 
  croatians can understand serbians and talk to them no problem , but there are a few words which are different and some grammar forms such as infinitive . 
  and croatians ca n't read cyrillic script . 
  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/could_care_less it can be used as could instead of could n't . 
  and that would be a * non-sequitur * . 
  i can also say that there 's a teapot which orbits the sun somewhere in space between the earth and mars , but that does n't mean that i 'm right . 
  and you still have n't explained why you think our languages are the same but danish and swedish are n't ? 
  how do you define a point after which two languages are different enough for them to be two different languages ? 
  i think it 's more of a semantic thing . 
  like danish and swedish , for instance . 
  because journalists are known for their * impeccable grammar * ... * uh-huh * . 
  especially when saying things like `` za nikoga '' , `` za ni\u0161ta '' , `` o ni\u010demu '' , and the likes ... ( correct : ni za koga , niza\u0161to , ni o \u010demu ), 
  a teenager would understand those words ( perhaps from listening ti\u0161ina by bajaga ) , but a child would n't . 
  i can tell you from personal experience . 
  also , fine , let 's say they are the same language . 
  in that case , since swedes and danes can understand each other , are swedish and danish also the same language ? 
  edit : also , you said that i 'm a linguo-nazi ( `` these '' was referring to me ) , which is funny because i 'm really left-wing and think it was better when we were unified in yugoslavia . 
  but on the other hand , were dr\u017ei\u0107 's dundo maroje and maruli\u0107 's judita written in serbo-croatian if those authors had no contact with serbia ? 
  and speaking of mrkva , i had to google when i heard the word '' \u0161argarepa '' on tv . 
  that 's great ?
