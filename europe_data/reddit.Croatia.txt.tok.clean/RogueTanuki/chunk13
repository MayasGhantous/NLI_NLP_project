   r + : oh , the parents , well , 0.1 % of parents completely refuses vaccination , it 's similar like in other countries , but it 's very little . 
  so this ratio of 2 pro-vaccine and 2 anti-vaccine is very , very unequal , because there should be 150 of us sitting on this side and 2 of them sitting on that side .

  you can find and excellent vaccination debate [ here , on the bottom of the page ] ( http://vijesti.hrt.hr/375312/otvoreno-36 ) , it 's 45 minutes long and chief pediatrician richter of zagreb pediatrics clinic and te\u0161ovi\u0107 , head of pediatric infectious disease ward of infectious disease clinic `` dr. fran mihaljevi\u0107 '' , completely , scientifically , systematically and utterly destroy every argument the antivaxxers ( gajski , internal medicine specialist and sladoljev , head of research and development of the immunology department ) tried to make .

  also , 5-10 per million cases ( 1 in 100,000-200 ,000 people ) will develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis , which starts around the end of puberty and early adulthood and is terminal .

  how exactly were other countries supposed to secede if they felt that serbia had most power in yugoslavia ( which , let 's be reasonable here , it did ) , when serbia would just veto any secession attempt ?

  no wonder it did n't make sense, 
  i mean , i get it . 
  but you should also realize that people 's army of yugoslavia ( jna ) invaded croatia after we declared independence through a referendum , which we were constitutionally allowed to do . 
  and jna high command was mostly serbian , so the war was seen as an attempt of serbian invasion of croatia , [ orchestrated by slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slobodan_milo%c5%a1evi%c4%87#milo.c5.a1evi.c4.87.27s_role_in_the_yugoslav_wars ) it would all be fine and dandy , but from stories of people who lived in yugoslavia , it seems that there were attempts to replace croatian language with serbian words in order to artificially create a serbo-croatian language with the goal of serbian domination over croatia , as opposed to peaceful coexistence of the two nations . 
  so nowadays when people mention serbo-croatian , i feel like they 're unconsciously approving of the genocide and destruction of one culture , in order to create an artificial thing which they would be happy with , but people who actually use the language would n't . 
  there is n't really a good example , but as far as i know , people from the south of sweden can understand the danish and vice versa , and there 's been historical animosity between them , so it would sort of be like if you suddenly merged danish and swedish into dano-swedish or swedo-danish . 
  not a perfect example , but you get the point .

  nevermind turkey , but why are newfoundland , berkner island and tierra del fuego not in eu ? 
  i 'm not sure whether this should be stickied , not that it 's not interesting , but regarding eu the france elections are more important since they have a semi-presidential system where the president can have a lot of power , whereas serbia ( like most european countries ) is a parliamentary republic where a president is more of a ceremonial title and the main person in charge of the country is the prime minister . 
  [ well ... ] ( https://sweden.se/society/10-things-that-make-sweden-family-friendly/ )  healthcare ( including dental care ) is essentially free in sweden until the age of 20 , although it depends slightly on the municipality . 
  infants get free vitamin d drops until the age of two -- important in sweden 's cold climate . 
   from the age of 20 , a visit to the doctor will cost you sek 100 -- 200 , depending on where you live , while a specialist consultation costs a maximum of sek 350 . 
  if you incur sek 1,100 in fees in one year ( a 12-month period , not necessarily a calendar year ) , a high-cost protection ( h\u00f6gkostnadsskydd ) scheme provides free care for the remainder of that year . 
   if you fall sick and ca n't work , you 're entitled to paid sick leave ( except the first day you are off work ) so you can concentrate on getting better . 
  the payment is the equivalent of about 80 per cent of your normal income , based on a nominal salary up to a maximum of sek 27,800 before tax ( 2015 ) .

   at a time where we 're all relaxing vigilance towards hiv not saying we should relax vigilance , but fearmongering also is n't helping . 
  the risk of getting hiv from an hiv positive person during anal sex is between 0.11-1 .38 % and from vaginal sex 0.04-0 .08 % . 
  however , it depends on a lot of factors . 
  [ source ] ( https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html ) also , the article may be wrong here , i think the number of people with the mutation is lower than 10 % , and the percentage is higher in scandinavia ?
