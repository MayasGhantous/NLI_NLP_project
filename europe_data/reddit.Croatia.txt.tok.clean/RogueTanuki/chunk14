  what do you mean delayed infection ? 
  if you have heterozygot mutation , [ you can be protected ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc1592103/ ) :  in conclusion , our data show a significantly higher frequency of ccr5-delta 32 heterozygous genotype ( p = 0.04 ) among the italian heterosexual esn individuals compared to hiv-1 seropositive patients , suggesting a partial protective role of ccr5-delta 32 heterozygosity in this cohort . 
  * nope rope, 
  yeah , we have a big [ street art scene ] ( http://travelhonestly.com/zagreb-street-murals/ ) . 
  there are also murals and grafitti such as [ these at zagreb 's remetinec roundabout 's underpasses ] ( http://lonac.blogspot.hr/2010/08/you-left-me-nothing-but-bones.html?m=1 ) . 
  `` it 's colder at night than outside '' - a famous quoute by an untitled author in a underground pedestrian underpass, 
  you do n't have to be a homozygote , but you are more resistant if you are . 
  and if i remember correctly from immunology class , it 's the ccr5-delta32 mutation from cd4 + t-cells , but there are two main types of human immunodeficiency virus , hiv-1 and hiv-2 . 
  hiv-1 has m-tropic isolates which use ccr5 receptor to enter the cell and after the deletion mutation of the 32rd locus ( delta32 ) , a person is immune to that specific hiv . 
  however , the t-tropic hiv-1 used another receptor , cxcr4 , to enter t-cells , so if a person with ccr5-delta32 is infected , he still becomes hiv positive . 
  hiv-2 can also use cxcr4 , but it 's less virulent than hiv-1 . 
  tl ; dr you can still get infected with hiv even if you have this mutation because different strains of the hiv virus affect different receptors . 
  and also , this mutation is the only way how we 've cured hiv up to now . 
  [ the berlin patient ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_berlin_patient ) had hiv and leukemia and he was irradiated to destroy his bone marrow , and got the bone marrow transplant from a donor who had the ccr5-delta32 mutation . 
  when he was later examined , it was found out that he no longer had the virus and remains the sole person who was ever cured of hiv .

  if somebody does n't understand , it 's funny because it shows their ignorance , sieg is victory in german , seig does n't mean anything . 
  ( studied german for 12 years in school , so i know ), 
  zagreb is on a seismic active area , due to the vicinity of \u017dumberak-medvenica fault , it is expected that a strong earthquake could hit at any moment and most of the 100-200 year old buildings in the center of zagreb would collapse , killing thousands . 
  [ reference to this ?

  meanwhile in croatia i saw that somebody wrote `` seig heil '' [ sic ] on the side of a building ... 
  i ca n't find that journalist 's sources in the article . 
  just because it 's a news article , does n't mean the numbers are right . 
  if you find an official government data , then it 's a different story . 
  where are the evidence that they wo n't join the workforce ? 
  and please do n't say something like `` all around you '', 
  more workforce , more tax income , more money to pay for the pensions of the aging population . 
  not captured world, 
  i 'm croatian and i 'm 1.75 , and i know guys who are shorter than me , even one who is around 1.65 , so i think it all depends . 
  for terminology 's sake , i do n't think that 's an oxymoron . 
  it is a contradiction , but an oxymoron is a contradiction used in a literary sense with a hidden meaning , like `` youthful old man '', 
  does erdogan know about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fourth_crusade#sack_of_constantinople ),

  or it could be a psychiatric disorder . 
  there 's also kl\u00fcver -- bucy syndrome , but i do n't know if that would present itself with rape , maybe if it included an underlying psychiatric illness .

  i think we should . 
  otherwise , it 's a sign of failed integration .

  if i 'm doing something for fun and both things can be detrimental to health i 'd rather do something which is * less * detrimental for my health than more . 
  that 's just common sense . 
  i was referring to [ this ] ( http://www.friatider.se/fyra-polispatruller-och-helikopter-jagade-tv-som-r-kt-cannabis ), 
  is n't it like super illegal in sweden ? 
  like , they had several cop cars and a helicopter on a manhunt after one guy who had a joint ? 
  if i were to try anything , i would try weed and not things like cocaine , which cause an addiction . 
  swedes are often very against cannabis , where irl cannabis has much milder side-effects than any of the harder drugs mentioned such as cocaine and methamphetamines . 
  just read katzung 's pharmacology . 
  from a medical viewpoint , it 's much better to smoke weed than do cocaine . 
  cocaine and meth can [ melt your nasal septum ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3846244/ ) and [ cocaine may destroy your blood-brain barrier ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19897082 ) . 
  cocaine can also [ cause a stroke ] ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc2600058/ ) . 
  cannabis has none of those complications . 
  i actually discussed this with my professor in clinical psychology course , and a terrorist does n't necessarily have to be mentally ill to kill people . 
  indoctrination is not a mental illness , per se . 
  translation :  around 20:50 the d\u00fcsseldorf police control center received evidence of a violent offense at the d\u00fcsseldorf main train station . 
  perpetrators , seemingly armed with an ax , attacked people indiscriminately . 
  at least 5 people were injured , one of them gravely . 
  a suspect , who apparently jumped from a nearby overpass , was arrested . 
  he is currently hospitalized with severe injuries . 
  an ax was seized . 
  the train station was widely blocked off and being searched through . 
  special units are also employed . 
  i do n't see why not . 
  because it 's geographically defined as being south of sava river, 
  and in croatia the only thing we heard in the news about germany is how a young man stabbed and killed a 9-year-old boy , braging about it online , and that there 's a police manhunt after him ...
