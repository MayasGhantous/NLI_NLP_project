  i discussed this with some people when we tried smoking and we did n't really feel hungry . 
  it 's possible that it 's a cannabis strain which does n't stimulate the appetite as much . 
  different cannabinoid compounds can have different effects on ghrelin . 
  that 's probably why i 've heard some people lose appetite and get nauseous when smoking weed .

  [ hetalia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hetalia:_axis_powers ), 
  it means painful, 
  tbh i always considered that to be , like you said , a step before the full word , like the english adjectives ending in - y , for example hladno vs prohladno like cold vs chilly . 
  i never heard someone use the word `` zra\u010dno '' , when prozra\u010dno could mean airy/breezy . 
  but yeah , you 're right , i just never thought about the prefix `` pro- '' in croatian in adjectives , if someone mentioned it i would think of verbs such as prozra\u010diti , provjetriti , projuriti , provjeriti , proglasiti , promovirati ( off the top of my head ) , where that prefix has the meaning of `` through '', 
  let 's not be racist towards white people . 
  if pro- means partly and sinji means `` the color of ash ( ashen ) ; gray , blue-gray '' , then you could say it 's also partly ashen or blue-grayish , but i felt like the translation `` ashen '' felt nicer,

  if you fertilize an egg in vitro , it 's not going to become human . 
  do you know the difference between a trophoblast and an embryoblast ? 
  do you consider trophoblast to be alive since it 's also made out of the fertilized egg cell ? 
  or would you say that life starts when the heart starts beating at 22nd day post-conception ? 
  or maybe you should consider [ brain development ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/development_of_the_human_brain ) , since the feeling of pain depends on the level of neural migration ? 
  and would you consider something alive if it ca n't survive outside the body at all earlier than 21 weeks post-conception ? 
  how do you define whether something is alive , where is the scientific evidence ? 
  is that * seriously * the argument you 're going with ? 
   the us is one unified country . 
  this could also be argued since the states have different laws . 
  for example , [ in colorado , you cal legally sell and smoke marijuana , whereas in texas selling pot is a felony and a conviction for possession of up to two ounces of marijuana can result in a jail sentence of up to six months and a fine of up to $ 2,000 .

  they probably did n't want to kill anyone , but their gross negligence caused a death of a man . 
  but you still broke the law , at least in croatia . 
  what you 're saying are technicalities , the truth is if you have n't done that someone would be alive . 
  in croatia , both willful homicide and manslaughter are called murder , only manslaughter is called `` murder out of negligence '' ( ubojstvo iz nehaja ) and is punishable from 6 months to 5 years in prison .

  ** croatia ** - david kom\u0161i\u0107 ( 19 ) murdered his ex-girlfriend kristina krupljan ( 18 ) by stabbing her more than 60 times after she told him she was pregnant with another man and wanted them not to speak anymore . 
  the victim 's mother states the killer was reported multiple times for previous threats and he was issued a restraining order in 2015 . 
  the suspect willingly surrendered to the police , and the media later found out that police was looking for him 2 weeks earlier , since he posted [ a photo on his instagram account ] ( https://www.instagram.com/p/bqikqqrlxuk/ ) of police officers looking for him with the caption `` when pigs are looking for you on sunday at 8 am and i 'm watching them via cameras on another address in a warm bed '' . 
  the killer was later photographed leaving the courthouse in handcuffs while winking and giving the thumbs-up gesture to a person off-camera . 
  the media coverage of the case caused the police union spokesman to say that the public blames the police for failing to do their job when such people who should be behind bars are walking free , when the blame is on the judiciary , which prompted the union of croatian judges to accuse the police of supporting the lynch atmosphere against them ... - a 77-year-old woman died when a fire truck ran over her leg during the fire in cvjetno student dorms . 
  she suffered an open fracture and her leg had to be amputated . 
  she was in critical state , but the doctors believed she would make it . 
  however , due to the severity of the injury , her age and the fact that she lost a lot of blood , she passed away . 
  the driver was subjected to a breathalyzer , but the test was negative for blood alcohol , and according to eye-witnesses , she was unfortunately in the vehicle blind spot . 
  her neighbors said she was happy and always ready to help them . 
  - famous scientist [ ivan \u0110iki\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivan_%c4%90iki%c4%87 ) , director of the institute of biochemistry ii at goethe university frankfurt , a notable figure in the fields of cancer research , announces he 's leaving his place as a professor at split medical university due to the rector claiming `` we 're all in a conflict of interest '' in a defense of education minister [ bari\u0161i\u0107 's accusations of plagiarism ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/15704-education-minister-barisic-found-guilty-of-plagiarizing-his-research ) . 
  \u0110iki\u0107 states he was n't in any conflict of interest and accused the prime minister plenkovi\u0107 of publicly and unfairly attacking him in the parliament . 
  in \u0110iki\u0107 's words , by defending plagiarism , plenkovi\u0107 explicitly attacked science , scientists and the science ethics board , and thus \u0110iki\u0107 asked plenkovi\u0107 to withdraw his words and should prime minister plenkovi\u0107 and rector an\u0111elinovi\u0107 publicly or in private withdraw their inappropriate statements , \u0110iki\u0107 said that would mark the continuation of his scientific work in croatia . 
  he further remarked `` the logic is very sound - if the prime minister is falsely accusing me of something in the parliament , then it 's clear that i do not wish to work in such a country and suffer unfair insults .
