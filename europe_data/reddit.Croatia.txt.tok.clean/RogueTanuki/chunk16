  that said , i will do all in my power that the young scientists i 'm working with do n't feel the consequences of the cessation of my scientific work in croatia , until the conditions are met for me working again in laboratories in any scientific institution in croatia . '', 
  - radical right-wing party a-hsp marched through zagreb center on sunday , lining up on the main square , wearing black and carrying us flag , flag of the independent state of croatia ( a nazi puppet state ) and a flag of a neonazi national democratic party of germany ( npd ) . 
  at one point '' [ za dom spremni ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/za_dom_spremni ) '' and `` hail trump '' could be heard . 
  the members stated they give public support to the us president donald trump . 
  the government severely condemned the few dozen party members who participated in the lineup , saying how the goal of the organizers of said actions is calculated and targeted toward inciting fear and intolerance in society and opposite of the government 's goals , saying how `` promoting the ustashe and nazi movements is attacking the basic values of the constitutional order of the republic of croatia '' .

  if you viewed it from an american perspective he would be croatian , because he was born in croatia and americans use [ jus soli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jus_soli ) . 
  but why does it matter to you where he came from ? 
  at the end of the day , we 're all human , there are no differences in dna between croats and serbs . 
  okay ? 
  i do n't know about my compatriot , it 's possible he 's lying . 
  i 'm just saying that attacking someone on the basis of their nationality and accusing him of lying might be considered discrimination on the basis of nationality . 
  i 'm not talking about this specific comment , but several earlier comments directed to myself . 
  i thought europe was trying to avoid animosity between nations ? 
  quite possible , since there is a lot of ex-yu people in sweden , 
  in general , i read in a previous comment of yours you mentioned tesla was serbian and the comment ( with the `` lol '' at the end ) seemed more like a provocation than an attempt of a reasonable discussion with valid arguments, 
  from your previous posts you seem to have an agenda against croatians , why is that ? 
  apples and oranges . 
  tesla was n't a poet . 
  but that 's not what the discussion is about . 
  even if all of them were left wing , the discussion is about whether or not that 's the reason why they 're not prosperous, 
  yes , the general opinion among serbian nationalists is that he 's serbian, 
  the original comment said :  i mean latin america tends to be more left-wing than us , too - are they better off ? 
  there are other reasons for prosperity or the lack thereof . 
  implying that them being left-wing is the reason they are n't prosperous . 
  you said :  the `` pink tide '' , aka the domnation of left-wing governments in latin america has been going on since 1998 . 
  implying that they have been left-wing since 1998 and not prosperous since then , as the original comment said . 
  then i asked you if they were prosperous before 1998 and if they were n't then them being left-wing has nothing to do with whether they are prosperous or not . 
  parents serbian , but born in croatia , and he himself said `` i 'm proud of my serbian heritage and croatian homeland '' , so kinda both, 
  yeah , i agree . 
  i feel like sweden has a problem with integrating those migrants into its society , maybe there should be mandatory swedish history and swedish language exams before you can get a residency permit , [ like in the uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms5wwlpmt0u ) . 
  luckily i never got to experience that . 
  started watching anime in high school and when we were on a class graduation trip to calella and barcelona i saw naruto dubbed in german on the tv in the hotel . 
  the horror ... zazuke , zakura , kakashi-zenzei, 
  in what way compared for example to matrei in east tyrol or katschberg ? 
  so basically you 're saying that before 1998 latin america was heaven on earth , right ? 
  what , you get free handjobs ? 
  i had a blast in austria , ca n't really see how it can get better . 
  actually googled it now , and [ you 'd be surprised ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alarm_f%c3%bcr_cobra_11_%e2%80%93_die_autobahnpolizei#international_broadcasters ), 
  i googled a bit and [ found ] ( http://www.skimap.info/europe/sweden/are/ski_map_are.gif ) [ \u00c5re ] ( https://www.skisafari.com/sites/ss/files/are-ski-resort.jpg ) .

  :o i must have missed that season , but to be fair , there are a lot of seasons . 
  semir goes through partners like a fat guy through nutella jars . 
   i think that people from ee/balkan have far more problems in nw europe , including sweden , than many would wish would be truth ...  sweden gets ee/balkan immigrants ( ... ) [ they can ] assimilate ( and overcome cultural differencies ) far more easily . 
  this is huge advantage . 
  these two sentences contradict one another a bit , can you explain what you meant ? 
  for example , if i 'm from eastern europe but am liberal , hard-working , well-educated , and also hate people sitting next to me in public transit , would i have more problems in sweden if i were to move there ? 
  eye and symmetry do n't rhyme, 
  you forgot the / s, 
  gastarbeiter literally means : gast ( guest ) + arbeiter ( worker ), 
  would you say that eastern europe/balkans are compatible with sweden because they were socialist for a long time after ww2 ? 
  are there ski resorts like that in sweden ? 
  i feel like skiing in france is more expensive than austria ... 
  [ those are synonyms . 
  ] ( https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wikisaurus:easy ) the difference is that lako can also mean light , as in not heavy , whereas jednostavno ca n't . 
  mount white :p, 
  that 's why you should look into studies from journals with high [ impact factor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impact_factor ), 
  you ca n't ignore international politics in this day and age, 
  not in the same way , much closer . 
  most fascist dictators are built on nationalistic ideologies , just look at hitler and mussolini , both fascists , did what they considered to be best for their national prosperity and to strengthen their nation . 
  the very definition of the word fascism is [ authoritarian nationalism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fascism ) . 
  you have a point , but i 'd say that in general , higher education develops critical thinking . 
  but the thing is , most countries are n't democracies . 
  most countries are republics where the electorate votes for their representatives , which is n't a direct democracy . 
  but the thing is , reviewing scientific studies from reliable can show you previous experiences with the crops , and it makes highly educated people reach an informed decision . 
  people who are more educated are less likely to be manipulated by , for example , people who say vaccines are bad because the word of mouth is that they cause autism , when there are multiple studies which show that they do not . 
  so , esperanto ? 
  * european federation, 
  so that if trump withdraws from nato and russia launches an invasion on europe nation states can be picked off one by one ? 
  nationalism is closely linked to fascism and irredentism, 
  and a national identity does ? 
  how exactly ? 
  maybe we should have a meritocracy - for example , if a person is highly educated his vote is worth 2-3 people , or if he speaks several languages . 
  whereas if a person has a criminal record , his vote is worth less , like for example 0.5 people . 
  it would be interesting to see whether how many people in texas or california feel the same way, 
  [ you were saying ?

  yeah , those things do n't really block light . 
  you should get pvc blinds , 
   go ahead and wreck your country people in rinkeby are doing this for you . 
  not if you wear a helmet, 
  yeah , they should simply beat them up with batons , killing someone is a permanent solution , police beating them up is more educational and deterring . 
  do n't they have riot police with , you know , helmets and police batons ? 
  try throwing rocks onto police in croatia , you 'll probably end up in a hospital ...
