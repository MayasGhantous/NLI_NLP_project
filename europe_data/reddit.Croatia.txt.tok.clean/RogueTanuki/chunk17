  when i put them all the way down they put the room in complete darkness even at noon, 
  i know that in the balkans a lot of kids do n't take these international standardized tests seriously so they write stupid things to seem edgy and `` f *** school '' mentality to look cool , so when students actually want to solve those tests , the `` idgaf majority '' brings the class average down . 
  it 's for the light during the 6-month winter , 
  how do you know that that is what is happening ? 
  you 're lecturing another on using a logical fallacy , and yet you 're claiming that they would have experienced a drop in crime had they not imported a bunch of migrants . 
  you do know that 1st generation immigrants usually do n't commit crime , the higher risk is with 2nd generation ? 
  and where are your sources about how all of that crime is only due to immigrants and not , for example , internet-related crime which increased in this decade ? 
  you do also know that sweden reclassified sexual harassment as rape and that would also increase the number of crime cases . 
  also , when looking at the correlation immigrant = crime , are you looking from an independent objective journalism news source or a right-wing agenda news source ? 
  he must be a sjw so harrasment = rape for him / s, 
  breitbart probably . 
  in the same way i can say the us needs to ban guns because guns were used in sandy hook massacre and the orlando shooting etc. 
  sources ? 
  well , in 4 years we 'll see how your great new president will fix all the problems . 
  it 's gon na be great . 
  it 's true . 
  [ looking at the statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_in_sweden ) it seems crime in sweden has n't increased in recent years ... 
  sort of familiar , but i remember more benjamin blumchen from super rtl, 
  [ it 's also an anime ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/calimero ), 
  when you realise it 's actually an anime , [ mitsubachi m\u0101ya no bouken ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/maya_the_honey_bee ), 
  nope , i 'm just saying not literally every thing which is written on wikipedia is true . 
  that 's why there are citations . 
  also , not all croats hate the serbs ... 
  did n't the eu plan to use solar energy from algerian desert to power all 28 member states ? 
  [ found it ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desertec ), 
  i shall, 
  yes , i agree . 
   writers from croatia , serbia and one from slovenia who ? 
  and iirc , the agreement was n't ratified by the parliaments . 
  it 's funny how some aspects of life in croatia ( e.g. 
  railways ) were better during austria-hungary than nowadays ... 
  you 'll be surprised to find out i support european federalism and everything you listed and i 'm a liberal . 
  i 'm just objective - you obviously have n't mastered viewing things from other people 's perspective and have n't realised that there are a lot of people who would n't be okay with getting rid of their nationality and heritage in order to create a new country . 
  and if you would go about doing it by force that would be no different than fascism . 
  aaand of course i get downvoted . 
   show me a single country that is not heavily in debt [ here you go ] ( http://mentalfloss.com/article/28473/debt-free-zone-how-liechtenstein-manages-live-within-its-means ) but i 'm just saying it 's debatable if yugoslavia could survive the transition to capitalistic market . 
  yes , but did the majority and how many of them did it out of fear of being branded anti-state elements ? 
  i mean , i 'm not a nationalist , i 'm just trying to be objective . 
  you could argue that yugoslavia was the same like if sweden , denmark and norway became a country called nordgermania and sweden started to push swedish as the official language , changing the spelling and grammar of danish and norwegian to be more like swedish . 
  just to draw a parallel . 
  it would still be a really strong country , the only thing is would swedes , danes and norwegians want to let go of their nationality and become nordgermanians ? 
  iirc yugoslavia basically borrowed money until its economy imploded ? 
  detroit ? 
  i recognise the sentence from [ this show ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4i2ky6qeas ), 
  both . 
  it should definitely be legal as a controlled substance in a shape of perscription drug , but alcohol has virtually the same effect as cannabis ( in layman 's terms , lowers mental ability , can be bad for the body ) , so i would legalize recreational use for people older than 21 . 
  or wait a few years to see the effects of legalization in ohio ( on public health , economy , etc. ), 
  and if the effects are positive , legalize it . 
  was n't that the reason for christian tattoos ? 
  like , when boys were tattooed with christian symbols they would n't be taken to janissaries or something ? 
  a lot of people are against serbia because serbian paramilitary forces committed atrocities during the yugoslav wars , such as the [ srebrenica massacre ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/srebrenica_massacre ) , but the thing is , you ca n't blame a whole country/nation for what a part of their people did , a thing a lot of people forget when they blame serbia or when the blame the us for , for example , invading iraq . 
  it 's a different dialect i would say . 
  at one time serbia sent a song to the eurovision which has a line `` na ivici nerava '' , and i completely could n't figure out what that meant until i went to google translate . 
  we say `` na rubu \u017eivaca '' . 
  i 'm a 4th year student , so it 's basically certain that i 'll graduate . 
  and i already passed physiology , pathology and pharmacology , and listened to prof. trkulja 's lecture on medical cannabis , [ this is his lecture at the society for the promotion of science and critical thinking ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5iijdobpdi ) . 
  i 'd like to see what makes you think medical marijuana is so unsafe ? 
  well , i 'm a med student , not a pothead , so ... your argument is invalid . 
  the thing is , you consider it to be a drug , i 'm guessing in the term of narcotic , not a pharmaceutical . 
  i would n't necessarily legalize it for personal use , but as a future medical professional , the professor at our pharmacology class lecture stated that he supports a peer-reviewed study on the effects of cannabis on palliative treatment of pain in cancer patients with specific dosage regulated for maximum pain-relief effect , and i agree with that . 
  and if it were legalised , i would argue it would have to be for people older than 21 , because if i remember correctly , studies have shows it can affect teen brain development , so it would be better to wait until 21 before using cannabis . 
  it would still leave the issue of a rare type of cancer which causes pain in minors , whether legislation would allow the use of medical cannabis in that case . 
  the government , not the people , are scared of alcohol . 
  but from what i hear , even the people are against marijuana . 
  i though you would write `` i ca n't wait for croatia to already get its act together and finally build m-95 degman '' was disappointed, 
  to be honest , after hearing how people in sweden sometimes get wasted with alcohol on weekends , i think it 's funny they have this almost pathological fear of marijuana . 
  i mean , both statistically and chronically , alcohol is worse for your body than marijuana . 
  alcohol abuse is putting a huge burden on the medical professionals and the economy , and after cirrhosis develops the only cure is a liver transplant , which after an alcoholic gets it by promising he wo n't drink anymore , he starts drinking again soon , essentially throwing the transplanted liver away . 
  at least that 's what happens in croatia . 
  so , i find it hypocritical if a person supports that marijuana should be illegal , but not alcohol , which caused countless more deaths than marijuana did . 
  [ also this maybe ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg7hje4afme#t=04m55s ), 
  thay may be , but we still studied pearl harbor and the battles of midway , okinawa , and the role of japan and the us in the war . 
  and it 's arguably more important to know who started the war and how it escalated in the first place . 
  composition by region which shows most people came from croatia has sources , whereas the part with percentage of ethnicity in the table does n't . 
  it 's possible to unwillingly rape someone while sleepwalking , there 's medical precedence for it , and it 's horrible to think about . 
  basically your body thinks it 's having sex with somebody willingly while your mind is asleep . 
  i mean , you [ try to do a handshake and ... ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/news/2519-lika-handshake-croatia-s-most-bizarre-legal-ruling-to-go-to-court-of-human-rights-in-strasbourg ), 
  to continue the alliteration babbling , bumbling band of baboons, 
  how does that prove serbs were the majority in the partisans ? 
  oh , yeah , right , tojo . 
  i also remember some general who was executed because his troops did war crimes and it was an early example of military responsibility how superiors are responsible for the actions of soldiers under them or something . 
  dunno , but i 'd reckon most could name that hirohito was the emperor of japan during ww2 . 
  we also mentioned the tanaka memorandum in high school history class . 
  tbh i also eat scrambled eggs with ketchup and people have divided opinion on that, 
  you 're implying i said ustashe were n't murderers and nazi collaborators , and i definitely did n't say that . 
  then their education is subpar , because i would expect every country to cover ww2 in history class . 
  source ? 
  b-but spaghetti bolognese tastes better with ketchup ; - ;, 
  [ draza was a collaborator ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dra%c5%bea_mihailovi%c4%87#allied_support_shifts )  on 10 december , churchill met king peter ii in london and told him that he possessed irrefutable proofs of mihailovi\u0107 's collaboration with the enemy and that mihailovi\u0107 should be eliminated from the yugoslav cabinet . 
  read message to adolf by osamu tezuka , it 's a really good comic based on this premise, 
  yeah , tbh a lot of people from hdz were in the communist party ... 
  croatia had a fascist dictator ( paveli\u0107 ) , but the problems were forgotten after a communist dictator ( tito ) , so that 's the problem here . 
  [ we 're the thailand of europe ] ( http://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/news-archive/hitler-as-iconic-asian-fashionista-what-is-it-with-thailands-love-affair-with-hitler/ ), 
  well , not trying to argue against that , [ but ... ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swastika#asia ), 
  afaik the croatian ustashe government at the time was n't beloved and most people were against them but too scared to do anything also ,  the usta\u0161e 's genocidal onslaught on its minorities provoked mass movements of resistance , inspired in part by royalist ( \u010cetnik ) and -- more effectively -- communist ( partisan ) ideologies , but driven primarily by a determination to fight back by any means . 
  the uprisings were particularly strong in rural areas where many village populations fled from the terror and then mounted guerilla operations from vantage points in the mountains and forests . 
  on 22 june 1941 , the sisak partisan detachment was formed in brezovica forest near sisak ; this was to be celebrated as the first armed resistance unit formed in occupied europe during world war ii . 
  croats , serbs , bosniaks , and citizens of all nationalities and backgrounds began joining the pan-yugoslav partisans led by josip broz tito ( who was croatian ) . 
   the partisan movement was soon able to control a large percentage of the ndh ( and yugoslavia ) and before long the cities of occupied bosnia and dalmatia in particular were surrounded by these partisan-controlled areas , with their garrisons living in a de facto state of siege and constantly trying to maintain control of the rail-links . 
  in 1944 , the third year of the war in yugoslavia , croats formed 61 % of the partisan operational units originating from the federal state of croatia .
