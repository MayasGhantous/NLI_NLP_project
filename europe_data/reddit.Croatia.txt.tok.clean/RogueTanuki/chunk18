   the federal state of croatia also had the highest number of detachments and brigades among the federal units , and together with the forces in bosnia and herzegovina , partisan resistance in the ndh made up the majority of the movement 's military strength . 
  in croatia too . 
  it 's kinda like saying america instead of `` united states of america '', 
  i think i read somewhere that if you throw gum on the floor and police catches you , you 're sentenced to clean the streets . 
  do n't know if it 's a myth or if it 's true, 
  so brygga is a pier and bro is a guy in a snapback and a tank top holding a beer can ? 
  kidding , i see the difference now , but what confused me was that i went to wiktionary and there it said it was [ a bridge ; jetty ] ( https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/brygga ), 
  i do n't like thompson, 
  but would n't his surname then be had\u017eitesihovi\u0107 ? 
  or do i have wrong information that after muslims perform the hajj they put `` had\u017ei '' prefix on their surname ? 
  oh , i thought it was hard since google translate has a seizure when you ask it to pronounce it in french ( it says something like `` kheyerka '' ) when it 's pronounced `` khr-kh '',

  you can destroy industrial compounds with regular bombs such as those used in the bombing of dresden , but the fact that they used bombs which engulf large areas into flames when they knew the japanese mostly live in wooden houses leaves little room for interpretation .

  it 's like the sjw , radical people are always louder . 
  there are a lot of conservative people in croatia , but there are also croatians who are liberal and anti-fascist . 
  do n't forget that .

  not to mention the english sign is written `` airport franjo tu\u0110man '' , when afaik the name should be before airport , like `` laguardia airport '' or `` john f. kennedy airport '' .

  when did you visit ? 
  i like krka more than plitvice lakes , that wooden path over the shallow crystal clear water which looks like fish are swimming in air below you and lush rainforest-like green canopy above looks really alien ... 
  not only that , but binding of carbon monoxide to haemoglobin causes the haemoglobin molecule to increase the affinity to oxygen on the other 3 binding sites , meaning that while haemoglobin carries the oxygen through the blood , it ca n't release it in the hypoxic tissue . 
  grad means town/city in croatian , but i think it means castle in slovenian . 
  croatian word for castle is dvorac or zamak . 
  maybe walled cities with a castle were called grad so the word had a double meaning or something ... 
  i knew it was a matrix reference but did n't understand why , thanks for the explanation, 
  what the hell is the red pill , i went to that subreddit a few weeks ago but could n't figure out the theme ?

  the page is aptly named `` smh '', 
  is omicron read oh-mi-cron or oh-mee-cron ( in croatia we use the latter ), 
  in physics , in croatia we pronounce it / mi / ( like english `` me '' ), 
  i 've read somewherr that people who were saved from comitting suicide in a closed garage with the car running said that they changed their mind but co made them too weak to be able to turn off the engine and save themselves . 
  though , i do n't know how true that is because as a medical student i kinda think your brain would need more oxygen to function than your muscles so if the co made haemoglobin release less oxygen into your tissue the lack of oxygen would first make you pass out , then be unable to move . 
  so take it with a grain of salt . 
  the problem with co is that it 's very hard to notice until it 's too late ... 
  in croatian , the word we use for castle ( dvorac ) is used for a large estate where a member of nobility lived , for example , [ eltz family castle in vukovar ] ( https://inavukic.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/palace-ettz-vukovar-croatia.jpg ) . 
  however , it would be more akin to a manor , i think .

  originally a 13th century fortress , it 's located in the town of ozalj ( oh-zahly ) in central croatia , on a cliff above the river kupa ( pronounced koopa ) .

  however , it works both ways , it would probably be hard for the enemy army to advance,

  to the dismay of students worldwide ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  did n't the education minister say in the news that the exhibition is back in place ? 
  i mean , even if the current right-wing government is in power , i kinda think if they did n't react to this that it would be a really low thing to do . 
  especially since the croatian antifascist associations already reacted in the media, 
  better word is tragicomical, 
  1416 - republic of ragusa ( dubrovnik ) bans slave trade, 
  you misspelled `` tv shows in general '', 
  yeah , maybe we should make it a federation , like united states of europe . 
  i think that the use would be a force to be reckoned with . 
   it 's you all who have given him the credit he needs to make these things happen better to say `` some of your compatriots '' instead of you , because saying `` you '' implies all americans voted for trump , where the fact is more than half of the voters did n't vote for him . 
  i do n't think we have a word for burgundy in croatian . 
  i think we use `` rotten sour cherry color '' . 
  but seriously , that 's common - `` boja trule vi\u0161nje '', 
  speaking of , when i was on a class trip to spain and we stayed overnight in cannes , we went to mcdonalds and i wanted to order french fries so i said `` pommes frites '' ( pohm-free , since we call them like that in croatia and i thought it originated from france ) , but the woman who was taking the order just looked at me like she did n't understand what i was saying . 
  are they called differently in france ? 
   even though the name sava became very common among slavs ( and not only among south slavs ) , especially as a personal name ( either male or female ) and has a `` slavic tone '' , the river 's name has pre-slavic celtic and roman origins ; [ 144 ] strabo writes in geographica 4.6.10 ( composed between 20 bce and 20 ce ) of the river sa\u00fcs , [ 145 ] and the romans used the name savus . 
  another name , used for the sava in entirety or its lower part by strabo , is noarus .
