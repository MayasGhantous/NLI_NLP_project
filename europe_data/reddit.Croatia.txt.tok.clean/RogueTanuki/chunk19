  famous sights in moscow are the kremlin which is the seat of power of the russian government and the st. 
  basil 's cathedral , whose architect was blinded by ivan the terrible so that he does n't build anything as beautiful as that . 
  also it 's on the red square .

  * i wo n't go into history with the [ royal family ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aisdtq9dw9g ) and wwii and ussr because that would take too long . 
  * there are several large cities in siberia such as yekaterinburg and novosibirsk . 
  lake baikal , the deepest lake in the world , is in russia . 
  ural mountains separate european and asian part of russia . 
  khabarovsk on amur river is close to border with china and one of the largest cities in the far east is vladivostok which has a huge bridge . 
  the easternmost penninsula is kamchatka , and they also say the kuril islands are theirs , which is a border dispute with japan , who say they are theirs .

   6:54:00 arrive at the main station on time . 
  the train should be waiting . 
  it is not there . 
   6:55:01 ask the lady at the ticket booth how late is the train . 
  the lady has no idea . 
   6:57:02 train is still missing . 
  enter the cafe to have coffee . 
  there is no waiter . 
  maybe he 's on the train . 
   6:58:35 check the train schedule online and realize it was last updated in 1995 . 
   6:59:54 stare at the train tracks . 
  contemplate life and the fact you 're late to work again . 
   7:01:05 ask the ticket booth lady again . 
  the lady is pissed and she says she 's not here to give information . 
   7:01:35 check the sign on her booth , it says `` information '' . 
   7:02:05 go back to the terminal , hear an announcement that the train is an hour late due to a malfunction . 
   7:02:10 take the bus . 
  meanwhile in croatia they 're planning on putting wifi on random tram lines , 2-3 trams , to see `` if people are interested '' . 
  not even sure there will be a sign `` there 's free wifi here '' ... 
  it probably depends on where you work and your hobbies outside work . 
  can you speak swedish and have you tried sverok ? 
   i 'm an agnostic/atheist , but seriously just today i saw a newspaper headline about how 78 % of youth/young adults in croatia believes in god with the subtitle `` religious nation '' . 
  which , i mean , seems a bit high ...

  washington has denounced harald bluetooth : `` it 's time i told the world of your sins . '', 
  i 'm just here putting on 10 layers before going outside on -11 \u00b0 c. . . 
  yeah , also continentality , oceanity , temperature inversion , etc. 
  that 's temperature , not air pressure . 
  very low temperatures are actually connected to high air pressure area ( anticyclone ) , which brings dry and clear weather . 
  so sunny , but very cold . 
  whereas cyclone brings warmer weather ( still below 0 \u00b0 c ) and ice rain/snow . 
  at least , that 's what we learned in school . . 
  krka is my favourite national park , i loved it more than plitvice , but i never went during winter . 
  in the summer there 's that wooden path with green canopy above and shallow crystal clear water below and fish swimming , it looks really alien, 
   `` the first pages of the holy scriptures describe how the original sin was created from disobedience . 
  disobedience is a sin common to both adam and eve , but it mostly strikes a woman because the devil has made the man a slave of sin by using woman 's disobedience . 
  adam has , how it often happens today , sinned out of pity for his wife . 
  adam felt sorry for his wife eve , he did n't want to leave her alone in her sin , but he wanted to be close to her , even in that sinful pity . 
  so , sin has entered the world from a woman 's disobedience . 
  thus a woman is even today in a special way in great temptation of disobedience . 
  disobedience here means that a woman is tempted to build her life without god , that she does not want to have a `` head '' ( jesus christ , the church , a man/male ) towards which she should be obedient . 
  disobedience is shown in desire for the rights for equality which erases differences , in that a woman does n't want to accept that she was made of adam , and not adam of her , that she is secondmost , and a man foremost . 
  disobedience is also shown in what we would call two biblical syndromes of disobedient women : `` martha syndrome '' , an disobedient activist woman without peace of mind and `` magdalene syndrome '' , a lazy woman of comfort and pleasures , overly caring about herself . 
  my text will probably provoke ridicule from men and women who distanced themselves from christian faith , because for them such speak of women 's obedience means a return to patriarchal society and represents subjugation of a woman . 
  however the critics and whatever the suspiciousness to this kind of speech , we can not deny the true biblical , christian image of a woman , meaning that the greatest temptation for a woman is disobedience . '',

  we also have similar ideas in croatia . 
  sorry about any mistakes during the translation , but i just think it 's disgusting so i translated as fast as possible .

  students in croatia like to fool around on these kinds of tests to look `` cool '' and `` rebel against the system '' in class ...

  i do n't think most languages have such mutually unintelligible dialects .

  thing is , [ dundo maroje ] ( https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/dundo_maroje/prolog_dugog_nosa,_negromanta ) is a mid-16th century play written in croatian in republic of ragusa , and i do n't really see how ragusa would be connected to serbia and serbian language ... 
  - serbian same sentence in those language ( s ) . 
  i 'd say it 's not really the same . 
   i can tell the difference between two people who grew up close to the border on either side , so it 's not like it 's a fluid mass tbh , the same goes with croatian and serbian , you can tell the difference when each is being spoken, 
  when i watched bro ( e ) n , it seemed people from malm\u00f6 and copenhagen could understand each other ... 
  i have never in my life heard anyone say `` sku\u017eajte '' , but i live in zagreb . 
  maybe it 's used more often outside the capital ? 
  what does that mean , is it like `` ku\u017ei\u0161 '' ? 
  for people who do n't understand the joke , pivo means beer, 
  i mean , you could classify it as a different dialect . 
  if i told my little brother `` kupi \u0161argarepu za supu '' he would blandly stare at me and would n't understand , but if i said `` kupi mrkvu za juhu '' , he would . 
  so there are some words which are different ( for example , \u0161argarepa / mrkva ( carrot ) , kino/bioskop ( cinema ) , promet/saobra \u0107aj ( traffic ) ) , but a lot which are similar , which is obvious from the picture of the cigarette package . 
  i know , but i could n't find another source haha, 
  more like you ca n't unsee it ...
