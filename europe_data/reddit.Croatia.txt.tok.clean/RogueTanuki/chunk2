  also , in my view , no reasonable trier of fact could have dismissed vojislav [ e { elj 's responsibility for aiding and abetting . 
  indeed , all the conditions required by case -- law have been met to establish , on the one hand , his acts of material and moral assistance to his volunteers , called `` \u0160e\u0161eljevci '' , and , on the other , his substantial contribution to the crimes committed by these volunteers . 
  this assistance comprised not only the recruitment of volunteers but also the organisation of the recruitment that involved all levels of the serbian chetnik movement ( or s ^ p ) and of the serbian radical party ( or srs ) , which he controlled with an iron fist . 
  in addition , before going to the front , these volunteers were indoctrinated with his violent speeches that , instead of reminding them of the need to abide by the geneva and the hague conventions , fostered violence against the non-serbs by brandishing the chivalric traditions of the chetniks , who are not known for exercising restraint on violence in war time . 
  the \u0160e\u0161eljevci were deployed on the ground in localities more often than not decided by vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj . 
  besides , these volunteers knew full well what their mission was : to participate in the ethnic cleansing operations conducted by the serb forces , by forcibly removing the non-serbs from territories claimed by the serbs . 
  furthermore , based on the evidence on the record , it appears that vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj 's numerous visits to the field , and the speeches he delivered during these visits , boosted the morale of these volunteers and encouraged them in their mission . 
  the evidence has shown that these volunteers and their families were financially , medically and psychologically supported by vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj , his chetnik movement and his party during the entire time of their military service and even after that time , which constituted another reason to enrol , in addition to the nationalist and extremist ideology they shared with the man whom they considered as their `` god '' or `` supreme commander '' -- i am quoting the evidence . 
  there is no need for me to expand further on vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj 's physical acts of assistance ( or actus reus ) in connection with the crimes committed by the serb forces on the ground and the evidence that demonstrates beyond all reasonable doubt that such acts of assistance existed . 
  furthermore , as regards vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj 's state of mind ( or mens rea ) at the relevant time , we also admitted ample direct and circumstantial evidence that , in my view , serves to establish it . 
  thus , the majority does not even consider it , which is not reasonable for a trier of fact . 
  i wish to point to one last aspect of the majority 's unreasonable approach towards the prosecution 's allegations of vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj 's responsibility for complicity with his volunteers : in the majority 's view , the fact that these volunteers were officially placed under the command of the armed forces militates in favour of excluding vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj 's responsibility . 
  this consideration is irrelevant when analysing forms of responsibility , such as incitement or aiding and abetting . 
  however , as regards vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj 's responsibility for participating in a jce with the serbian forces and their leaders , the incorporation of the volunteers into the official armed forces is an additional element that supports a finding of conspiracy and cooperation among the members of the jce in furtherance of the criminal purpose of ethnic cleansing . 
  under the pretext that the prosecution did not do its job well -- one can always do better , and the trial chamber could have also done better from the outset of this case , notwithstanding the difficulties it encountered during the trial -- the majority sets aside all the rules of international humanitarian law that existed before the creation of the tribunal and all the applicable law established since the inception of the tribunal in order to acquit vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj . 
  on reading the majority 's judgement , i felt i was thrown back in time to a period in human history , centuries ago , when one said -- and it was the romans who used to say this to justify their bloody conquests and murders of their political opponents in civil wars : `` silent enim leges inter arma '' .1 ***** 1 `` in time of war the laws fall silent '' ( cicero oratio pro milone , 52 b.c. 
  here 's a dissent from the italian judge in the seselj trial : partially dissenting opinion of judge latanzi . 
  for several reasons , i disagree with most of the majority 's findings . 
  first of all , i find that the climate of intimidation to which vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj subjected the witnesses , by his conduct inside the courtroom and by that of his associates outside the courtroom , which also resulted in contempt proceedings , has not been taken into account by the majority . 
  yet , this factor should have been included in the chamber 's analysis of the evidence , and more specifically of the prior statements of various witnesses who later , partially or completely , withdrew their statements when they came to testify before the chamber . 
  these statements , which incriminate vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj , often corroborate one another , but the majority does not take this element into consideration . 
  furthermore , i find that insufficient reasoning , or no reasoning at all , is provided in support of most of the majority 's findings , in contravention of a trial chamber 's obligation to provide a reasoned judgment for the benefit of the accused and of the prosecution . 
  according to this principle , questions of law and fact , that form the basis of the chamber 's reasoning , are always provided . 
  i note , for instance , that the majority refers to witnesses ' written statements and to their testimonies , without providing any explanation , even though these various pieces of evidence are often contradictory . 
  i also note that the majority 's reasoning does not include the totality of the prosecution evidence and knowingly focuses on the sparse defence evidence on the record . 
  this prompts the majority , for instance , to consider the forced displacement in buses of non-serbs from their villages as a `` humanitarian aid '' operation , which is not a reasonable conclusion in light of the evidence on the record . 
  in addition , the majority very seldom mentions the applicable law , which is often contradicted by the reasoning followed by the chamber ; in the event that it does follow the applicable law , the chamber adds standards that are not provided for in the tribunal case - law . 
  i also find that the majority relies on irrelevant considerations to exclude vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj 's responsibility . 
  for instance , an element that is relevant when reconstructing the overall historical background , such as the war situation in the former yugoslavia , which , according to the majority , simply originated from an unlawful secession , is deemed relevant by the majority when drawing its conclusions on the crimes committed on the ground or on the question of responsibility . 
  another example : the war , which the majority seems to consider as legitimate , for it was aimed at defending serb interests , or the fact that the non-serbs armed themselves , are considered relevant to support the exclusion of the existence of a widespread or systematic attack in croatia and in bih , and to discard the crimes of destruction of villages or religious sites . 
  one last example : the legality of recruitment and deployment of the volunteers is considered relevant by the majority when excluding vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj 's responsibility for aiding and abetting , without taking into account the applicable case-law on this issue . 
  the judgment of the majority is replete with considerations that refer to ius ad bellum and constitutional law of the former yugoslavia rather than ius in bello , the sole relevant consideration before this tribunal . 
  indeed , the tribunal 's competence must be limited to determining whether war crimes or crimes against humanity have been committed and , thereafter , whether such crimes may have involved the responsibility of the accused . 
  i am , furthermore , satisfied that we have all the requisite evidence on the record to conclude beyond all reasonable doubt that a widespread and systematic attack existed in croatia and in bih and that crimes against humanity were committed in this context , including in vojvodina ( serbia ) . 
  likewise , we received ample evidence that established the existence of a joint criminal enterprise between vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj and the other members of the serb forces cited in paragraph 8 ( a ) of the indictment . 
  the purpose of this jce , as the prosecution clearly alleges - as opposed to what the majority contends - was to force the non-serbs , through the perpetration of crimes , to leave parts of the territory of the former yugoslavia . 
  in my view , all the conditions have also been met to convict vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj for the physical commission of the crime of persecution in the form of public and direct denigration of the non-serbian civilians through his speech in hrtkovci on 6 may 1992 .
