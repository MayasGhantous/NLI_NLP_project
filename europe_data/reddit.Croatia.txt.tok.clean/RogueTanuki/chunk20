  it 's like that microsoft joke - it 's micro and soft :p, 
  in croatia we say `` minus '' . 
  like `` it will be minus next week '', 
  you do n't really need classes to learn basic swedish , it 's easier than english or german , i learned basics in a few weeks of using duolingo .

  it 's a medical textbook , so i would n't say it 's `` simply wrong '' . 
  i think it considers people reading it not stupid enough to come to conclusions `` i can only eat microwave burgers for the rest of my life and i 'll be fine '' and considers people as smart enough to have balanced diet . 
  smoking, 
  smoking, 
  oxford handbook of clinical medicine , page 236 - simply eating less ( < 2080-2600 calories/day ) rather than specifying dietary content is emphasized , recognizing that there are no good or bad foods and no universally good or bad diets . 
  oxford handbook of clinical medicine suggests simply eating less ( < 2600 calories/day for men , < 2080 for women ) rather than specifying dietary content , recognizing that there are no good or bad foods and no universally good or bad diets . 
  ( page 236 ), 
  that 's true , even a lot of our doctors and med students smoke . 
  in croatia we often do autopsies , by law on new hospital patients who die within 24 hours, 
  so , if a next of kin is to inherit a huge amount of money and he suspiciously refuses the autopsy ? 
  dunno about lithuania , but here if a person dies within 24 hours of being admitted in the hospital , an autopsy is required by law, 
  nope , we use german standards for autopsies . 
  as a medical student on ccu rotation at zagreb university hospital , you 're quite wrong in your assumptions . 
  we may have a lot of problems , but our medical aid is excellent . 
  there are protocols which are followed , medicine you give if you suspect an mi , coronarography , stents , cabg , being aware of potential malign arrythmias , etc. 
  we study from western textbooks such as kumar & clark , harrison , etc. 
  our hospitals ( the ccu at least , and that 's what we 're talking about ) are comparable to hospitals in western europe , regardless if you find that hard to believe . 
  i 'd say the problem here is prevention , smoking , and unwillingness to make lifestyle changes . 
  i mean , we have patients who smoked 1-2 boxes a day for 50 + years . 
  would you really be surprised to get an mi after that ? 
  unless the kid is overweight , cardiovascular risk only starts to increase around mid-20s, 
  iirc , coffee does n't have that much to do with cvd, 
  healthcare is really good in croatia , dunno about other countries in the region . 
  there 's a reason why our healthcare specialists are sought after in the eu . 
  here you go : 24-year-old marko markovi\u0107 from kotor could be sentenced from 6 months up to 5 years in prison for killing a tortoise ( sea turtle ) in stoliv , after criminal charges were brought against him by the ecological inspection due to the reasonable suspicion that he killed a protected animal species . 
  inspection administration ( ia ) reminds that under the decision of protection of some plant and animal species due to their rarity and vulnerability the sea turtles are protected . 
  through that decision , their hunting and killing is forbidden , except if done for scientific purposes and with a permit of the competent authority . 
  ia reminds that the law of nature protection it is forbidden to catch , keep , own , kill or disturb protected species , especially during their mating season , raising their young , migration and hibernation . 
  the news were told that the young man , in a statement to the police and inspectors , said he killed the turtle in self defence . 
  `` markovi\u0107 gave an on-the-record statement that we was not aware that the turtle was protected species and that he did not kill it for economic reasons and material gain . 
  therefore , the ecological inspector has brought criminal charges against marko markovi\u0107 to the public prosecutor 's office , due to the reasonable suspicion that he killed a protected animal species '' , the ia stated , adding that in doing so he comitted a felony of the penal code `` killing and torturing animals and destroying their habitat '' , which warrants a prison sentence of 6 months to 5 years . 
  wwf has strongly condemned the incident of deliberate killing of the sea turtle in stoliv , pointing out the uncertain future of those animals who directly and indirectly perish due to human activity . 
  danijel kanski , the fishing expert in wwf adria , said that the sea turtles get hurt due to various human activities - as accidental catch in fishing , they get injured in contact with sea vessels or die from swallowing plastic waste which floats on the seas . 
  kanski said that the similar incidents jeopardize the perception of montenegro as a desirable tourist destination `` because guests nowadays more often choose destinations with preserved ecosystems full of life '' . 
  what 's nzh ? 
  in croatia we translated die hard as `` die manly '' . 
  if that happened in the us , the feminists would possibly go berserk . 
  oh sh * t , yeah , i was n't sure when i posted it . 
  it also means `` and '' in croatian , but we usually keep foreign names, 
  [ appropriate song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgnixgx2nlu ), 
   responsible for the most annoying song in the history of the universe . 
  i think [ this swedish song ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_dv9b0x7v4 ) might take that title, 
   h & m it 's funny because everybody in croatia calls it `` ha und em '' like it 's a german brand , when in reality it should be called `` ha och em '', 
   - grown men wearing shorts and white socks well , if they 're cargo shorts and you wear sneakers like converse all star with the socks , i think it looks fine .
