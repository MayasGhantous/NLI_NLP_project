  i 'm really surprised that every eu country has a right to veto any eu law or declaration . 
  how does eu ever get anything done ? 
  making use of a democratic right to vote against things you do n't agree with is completely fine if you respect the majority 's vote . 
  however , seems like hungary and other countries do n't respect the majority 's vote . 
  i do find it amusing how you put words in my mouth , do continue so that i can refute more of your arguments . 
  also , i do n't believe that my vote changes anything , but that 's probably because i 'm a liberal in a very conservative catholic country , and the backwards mentality is a bit depressing and the reason i want to move when i finish my education .

  you have every right to disagree . 
  but if a majority decides something and you try to sabotage that decision , that 's called not being collegial . 
  for example , if a government is democratically elected by a majority and you disagree with that government 's political stance and try to bring down the government by force , that is something known as a coup d'\u00e9tat , and is , in fact , frowned upon in most countries . 
   but they do ... that would be kazakhs and ukrainians respectively . 
  i meant that you meant russian overarching ethnicity . 
  they have their own ethnicity . 
  `` if the headline asks a question , try answering ` no ' . 
  is this the true face of britain 's young ? 
  ( sensible reader : no . ), 
  have we found the cure for aids ? 
  ( no ; or you would n't have put the question mark in . ), 
  does this map provide the key for peace ? 
  ( probably not . ), 
  a headline with a question mark at the end means , in the vast majority of cases , that the story is tendentious or over-sold . 
  it is often a scare story , or an attempt to elevate some run-of-the-mill piece of reporting into a national controversy and , preferably , a national panic . 
  to a busy journalist hunting for real information a question mark means ` do n't bother reading this bit ' . '', 
  mostly because they think us sees itself as `` world police '' and starts wars in the middle east for resources such as oil . 
  and nowadays i see a lot of comments on facebook about how the us is actually behind isis and how russia is better , which i consider funny because croatia has been at war with serbia and russia has been an ally of serbia for more than a century . 
  so , logic is obviously not something a lot of people who comment on facebook here possess . 
  i was thinking more of ussr , and countries like kazahstan and ukraine were a part of it , and they do n't really have an `` overarching ethnicity '' . 
  ca n't european parliament impose economic sanctions on hungary & co. for being disjoint from the rest of the union ? 
   the youth of eastern europe , for example , would gladly relinquish sovereignty for further integration . 
  oh , trust me , they would n't . 
  at least in croatia , a majority of young people have become nationalistic and anti-us in recent years . 
  there was a country which was a federation and member states had the right to secede . 
  however , when one of the states tried to secede , the other attacked .

  i 'm hoping to do my residency in sweden after i finish medical school here , i only have to see whether i 'll have to do the allm\u00e4ntj\u00e4nstg\u00f6ring , depending on whether croatia has an equivalent of medical internship ( there 've been some talks about incorporating it into the sixth year of med school ) , under tiden m\u00e5ste jag f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttra min svenska . 
  i also speak german and know a bit of japanese , but i like swedish as it 's much easier than german . 
  i was also thinking about going to the us , but after 6 years of sadistic med school exams i really do n't have the will to kill myself studying for usmle step exams , just because the us decided that eu medical license is an equivalent of toilet paper . 
  tldr - i 'm hoping to work as a doctor in sweden , so i 'm guessing there are other people from the eu planning on coming to sweden . 
  i do n't think the situation is that dire . 
  some also say that [ arena zagreb ] ( https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2009/11/dzn_arena-zagreb-by-upi-2m-3.jpg ) is ugly , but i like it,

  i think it 's a catholic church . 
  this is the [ swimming pool church ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_17rxtci037q/tov_dbla-6i/aaaaaaaaarc/23wvvjdninc/s640/novi+zagreb+%252825%2529.jpg ) [ from another angle ] ( http://www.zg-nadbiskupija.hr/userdocsimages/zupa%20utrine.jpg ),

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/haplogroup_i-m170 38 % -- 45 % of croats belong to the i2 haplogroup , which , according to [ this ] ( http://www.eupedia.com/europe/origins_haplogroups_europe.shtml ) came to be 17,000 years ago in the balkans area , whereas the i haplogroup came to be 25,000 years ago , also in the balkans area ( i 'm guessing since it was during the last glacial period , northern europe was still too cold for those people with no technology ) . 
  scandinavia has a high percentage of i1 haplogroup , which came to be 5,000 years ago . 
  so i wonder if the slavic people and scandinavian people have the same ancestors , mainly the i haplogroup 25,000 years ago ... 
  let 's not start on where the croats came from because there is n't a scientific consenzus and it always escalates into arguing about the white croatia and the iranian theory . 
  gallows are `` vje\u0161ala '' , to hang is `` objesiti '' and a `` hanged-man '' is `` obje\u0161eni ( k ) '' , so i do n't think it 's related , 
  or maybe eus veles , because he 's connected to magic and darkness and space is dark . 
  also , it rhymes . 
  we 're faring a bit better : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_croatian_navy_ships though i 'm not so sure what you can do with a [ navy sailboat ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_active_croatian_navy_ships#sailboats ), 
  i do n't know why our government does n't want to give them this part of the bay : https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/bay-of-piran_maritime-boundary-dispute.svg basically , it 's sort of like giving something out of pity xd, 
  tri ( three ) + glava ( head ) , triglav = three heads , three peaks . 
  also , in croatian , an adjective for `` three-headed '' is `` troglav ( i ) '', 
  the best party imo would be sdp * if * they got rid of milanovi\u0107 ( a really arrogant and rude party leader , who was pm until now ) , but i 'm 99 % sure that wo n't happen , so the way things are now , i do n't even know who i would vote for . 
  it will be interesting to see whether this government will last 4 years or will the tensions between hdz , most and pm ore\u0161kovi\u0107 increase up to the point that sabor ( parliament ) decides to propose a motion of no confidence ... 
  the government chooses the minister , not the people . 
  kinda related - if you want to read an excellent historical manga about vikings : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vinland_saga_ ( manga ) `` vinland saga is set in england starting in 1013 ad , the year in which the danish king sweyn forkbeard conquered most of it . 
  as king sweyn nears death , his sons , prince harald and prince canute , are arguing over his succession . 
  the story draws elements from historical accounts of the period such as the flateyjarb\u00f3k , the saga of the greenlanders and the saga of eric the red . 
  the story opens with the introduction of a small viking band led by a cunning commander named askeladd and containing a gifted young fighter named thorfinn . 
  the band chances on a besieged frankish fortress and makes a deal with the attacking army to work with them in exchange for half the fort 's plunder . 
  askeladd then hoodwinks them , escaping with his men by boat with all the riches of the fortress while the army is still battering down the gates . 
  despite being a valuable member of the company , thorfinn bears a deep grudge against askeladd as askeladd killed thorfinn 's father when thorfinn was a young boy . 
  the youth incessantly demands duels with his commander in an effort to get revenge , but invariably loses . 
  askeladd 's company finds employment as mercenaries in the danish invasion of london . 
  there they face off with a larger force led by thorkell the tall , a fellow viking . 
  thorfinn and thorkell meet in battle , and askeladd 's band flees from what they see as an unwinnable fight . 
  the two forces meet again later , however , when both commanders seek to capture the young danish prince canute . 
  askeladd succeeds in capturing the prince , but is forced once again to flee from thorkell 's larger army . 
  the company takes refuge for the winter in the frozen north of england near the danish encampment at gainsborough . ( ... ) '', 
  honestly , it is a fault of the country if it does n't have a good integration possibilities . 
  i 've discussed with a friend of mine how the problem is when immigrants arrive , they 're usually put into ghettos , such as husby and rinkeby in stockholm , and that removes the need to learn the language and adopt culture of the country they arrived in . 
  out of sight , out of mind , i suppose . 
  but that 's not a long term viable solution . 
  also , my previous comment was more regarding the current events , because if i 'm not mistaken , sweden has closed the oresundbron for immigrants ? 
  so immigration should be a lesser , not completely gone , but a lesser problem now , or ? 
  ya think ? 
  yes . 
  he does , but he also has no real power because the power is split between two right-wing parties , one of which presented itself as a `` third option '' in the elections and then betrayed the trust of most people who voted for it ( good job , btw ) . 
  furthermore , we have a large diaspora , many of which are either people who fled after ww2 in fear of persecution from yugoslavian authorities . 
  and then those people had children , who they taught how the [ independent state of croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independent_state_of_croatia ) was basically a croatian heaven on earth , which then lead to occasional controversies like [ croatian footballer from australia josip \u0160imuni\u0107 's salute ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josip_%c5%a0imuni%c4%87#salute_after_croatia-iceland_game ) `` driven by `` love for his croatian homeland '' '' ... and this diaspora regularly gives like 90 % of its votes to right-wing croatian parties . 
  and right-wing parties also get a lot of votes from `` diaspora '' in bosnia and herzegovina ( if you can call it that ) , and old religious people in more rural areas of the country , the number of which is rising due to population ageing . 
  at this point , we should n't be surprised , really ... 
  it 's a huge problem because a lot of young people nowadays are n't religious or nationalistic , and seeing these clashes between right-wing `` ustashe '' and left-wing `` commies '' in the media all the time , like we have n't moved a bit since ww2 , makes them sick of it and makes them want to emmigrate , which is bad for our already terrible demographic outlook . 
  talk about losing your head ... 
  sweden will become a third world country , they said . 
  immigration will destroy sweden , they said . 
  i live in croatia , so i have experience with my fellow citizens . 
  also , some statistics and news sources . 
  86 % of croats are catholic . 
  http://m.nydailynews.com/news/world/croatia-bans-gay-marriage-victory-catholic-backed-conservatives-article-1.1534210 https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/07/23/croatia-punished-for-swastika-on-soccer-field/ http://m.nydailynews.com/sports/soccer/croatia-soccer-player-faces-ban-pro-nazi-salute-article-1.1523375 the church basically controls the voters , most of which are old , conservative and not highly educated ( 20 % of people in croatia are highly educated , 43 % do n't know how to use the internet ) , so they do n't know any better , and this has literally led to priests saying to people who to vote for ( conservative parties , obviously ) or against ( gay marriage referendum ) . 
  and now that right wing party , which while it was led by ivo sanader performed economic crime , is back in power ( due to people * trying * to vote third party ) we get a minister of veterans who resigns due to illegal activity , another minister of veterans who forged 70 % of his thesis and a minister of culture who was condemned by simon wiesenthal center which urged for him to resign due to suspicion of him being pro-fascism .
