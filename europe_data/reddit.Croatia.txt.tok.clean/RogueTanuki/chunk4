  now tell me , if i do n't care about nationality , why would i want to live in a country like that ? 
  good example of the saying `` absence makes the heart grow fonder '' . 
  unless you 're conservative and religious , i ca n't see why someone would want to live here as opposed to more liberal western countries . 
  a fraction of war veterans , politically motivated , have been camping outside of the war veteran ministry for over a year now , going even as far as to block the savska street . 
  the police ca n't arrest them , even though what they 're doing is illegal , because since they 're veterans , many in the police support them and arresting them could start an uprising . 
  then we have the chaos that is croatian politics . 
  about that tragicomedy , you can read the wikipedia or news articles about the latest elections where people voted third party ( most ) and then that party decided to join a coalition with a right-wing party sentenced for economic crimes , or as people here call it , for `` robbing croatia '' ( just google ivo sanader ) . 
  then we got a new minister of culture , who is/was ? 
  a radical far-right supporter ( imagine if germany 's minister of culture was a neonazi ) and after the new minister of veterans resigned after a few weeks because it was discovered he was involved in criminal activity , the newly appointed minister forged 70 % of his thesis at the college of traffic . 
  also , croatia is mostly conservative and religious , though mostly in theory and when it suits them . 
  for example , some huge dumb religious dude does n't care that you should n't have premarital sex or other things like wearing mixed fabrics , but they have no problem yelling `` kill the fa **** s '' and assaulting people at the gay pride , with the silent support of the police . 
  split ca n't even have a pride without police providing strong security . 
  we 're lightyears away from amsterdam where a pride is a party event where the entire city goes out to drink and have fun , like the carnival in rio . 
  finally , most women are n't as aware of feminism here as in the west , so most girls ( at least who i meet in everyday life , though there are exceptions ) talk about fashion and makeup , and we have a high rate of family violence . 
  education also is n't that valued . 
  reading internet comments on sites such as jutarnji makes me lose faith in humanity , because most croatian people online are vehemently in favor of alternative medicine , chemtrails , hate the us , still argue about wwii ( ustashe/nazis , commies , chetniks ) and are against vaccination . 
  and i , as a medical student , have spent too much time arguing with them on those topics . 
  nowadays i do n't even bother and i just do n't read the comments on those sites . 
  also , driving school ( obligatory ) , exam and license costs around 1000 $ . 
  for more info , i suggest reading the translations of lyrics of the band elemental . 
  i learned english from watching cartoon network after school as a kid , basically . 
  dexter 's laboratory , ben 10 , foster 's home for imaginary friends , etc. 
  also , in the early 2000s , we had a lot of subbed english shows on tv such as full house , family matters , home improvement , married with children , so that also helped . 
   if they do n't take action then they deserve to live with the consequences . 
  kind of like croatia , who decided to ** re-elect ** a right-wing party which has been sentenced in court * for criminal activities * in fimi media case , and basically threw away 300,000 votes on most , unaware of the [ spoiler effect ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoiler_effect ) ... gg, 
  this remind me ... croatian police - to protect and serve ... in the world 's smallest car . 
  when you make a joke like that : https://media.giphy.com/media/l0nwpo3vhujpjdi4w/giphy.gif, 
  actually , i just found out it comes from latin * placenta * . 
  from that , you get romanian pl\u0103cint\u0103 and from that , hungarian palacsinta . 
  the new minister of * culture * zlatko hasanbegovi\u0107 , who stated that '' [ anti-fascism ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-fascism ) is an empty phrase '' , and for whom [ more than a 1000 cultural workers singed a petition to resign ] ( http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/nezadovoljstvo-raste-1132-kulturnjaka-potpisalo-peticiju-protiv-hasanbegovica/872761.aspx ) , and because of which [ more than 50 actors decided to leave the croatian association of dramatic artists ] ( http://www.tportal.hr/kultura/kazaliste/414483/glumci-masovno-napustaju-hddu-zbog-sutnje-oko-novog-ministra.html ) was [ discovered to have been among the editors ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/drago-pilsel--vise-je-od-kape-sporno-da-je-hasanbegovic-bio-clan-urednistva-casopisa-ndh---ivo-banac--meni-su-rekli-da-je-rijec-o-uniformama-hos-a----/1518009/ ) of the magazine which called for the renewal of the [ independent state of croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independent_state_of_croatia ) , a nazi germany puppet state , and it 's still unknown whether the cap he 's wearing is an [ ustashe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/usta%c5%a1e ) cap . 
  so basically , political controversy in croatia . 
  nothing new . 
  in croatia cr\u00e9pes are `` pala\u010dinke '' , i 'm guessing it comes from palatschinken . 
  [ carnival in croatia is always fun ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/zvoncari_viskovo_2008_9.jpg ), 
  some of the loanwords we nostrified and the german word it comes from , all of them used today in zagreb : \u0161pajza ( pantry , die speis ) gelender ( handrail on a staircase , das gel\u00e4nder ) plac ( ( farmers ' ) market , der platz ) ziher ( `` surely/you 're kidding '' , sicher ) forcimer ( anteroom ( first room when you enter the house ) , vorzimmer ) auspuh ( car exhaust pipe , der auspuff ) be\u0161tek / escajg ( cutlery , das besteck/esszeug ) blic ( camera flash , der blitz ) haustor ( apartment building entrance and stairwell , das haustor ) borma\u0161ina ( drill , die bohrmaschine ) \u0161rafciger / \u0161erafnciger ( screwdriver , der schraubenzieher ) for\u0161pan ( movie trailer , der vorspann ) gojzerica ( hiking boots , named after bad goisern ) knedla ( dumpling , der kn\u00f6del ) krumpir ( official word for potato , die grundbirne ) \u0161parhet ( stove , der sparherd ) kuplung ( car clutch , die kupplung ) lojtre ( ladder , die leiter ) nahtkasl ( nightstand , das nachtkastl ) paradajz ( tomato , der paradiesapfel ) rikverc ( car reverse gear , r\u00fcckw\u00e4rts ) sekirati ( se ) ( to ( be ) bother ( ed ) / annoy ( ed ) , sekkieren ) ve\u0161ma\u0161ina ( washing machine , die waschmaschine ), 
  in croatia , imo : * [ muzej prekinutih veza ] ( https://brokenships.com/en ) ( museum of broken relationships ) * [ muzej krapinskih neandertalaca ] ( http://www.mkn.mhz.hr/en/ ) ( krapina neanderthal museum ) * [ muzej suvremene umjetnosti ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/museum_of_contemporary_art,_zagreb ) ( museum of contemporary art ) also , i like [ lauba ] ( http://www.lauba.hr/en/homepage-2/ ) , but that 's an art gallery , not a museum . 
  hetalia taught me something : `` in september 1956 , due to a common foe during the suez crisis , an anglo-french task force was created . 
  french prime minister guy mollet proposed a union between the united kingdom and the french union * with elizabeth ii as head of state and a common citizenship * . 
  as an alternative , mollet proposed that france join the commonwealth . 
  british prime minister anthony eden rejected both proposals and france went on to join the treaty of rome , which established the european economic community and strengthened the franco-german cooperation . '', 
  too soon ? 
  reminds me of croatian * zvon\u010dari * http://www.jutarnji.hr/multimedia/archive/00367/halubajski_karneva_367149s0.jpg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zvon%c4%8dari, 
  technically , all humans are animals because that 's the biological kingdom we belong to . 
  yes , but that 's not a robot . 
  you can literally say this about every job in the world . 
  question is , what will happen to humans once robots can do all of the jobs better than humans can ? 
  and checking the records does not mean performance equal or better than a human surgeon - http://i.imgur.com/fczg3n9.gif, 
  technically , every job could be replaced with a machine , right ? 
  why even bother with people ? 
  also , speaking of new technology , i 'd just like to point out that when antibiotics were first invented , it was believed to be the end of the era of infectious diseases and that infectious medicine/infectiology would become an obsolete medical branch . 
  you can see how well that prediction turned out ... 
  robots do not possess creativity needed to invent new procedures nor the fine motor skills to react quickly and precisely in a medical emergency situation in an or . 
  we could accomplish a lot through genome editing , but people would still get injured in everyday life and need trauma surgery . 
  also , i do n't think some random disorders could be prevented through genome editing , such as down 's syndrome . 
  congenital genetic disorders like that and digeorge ( though that one is inheritable so i think genome editing could be used here ) carry a high risk of heart malformations such as the ventricular septal defect or , in case of digeorge , tetralogy of fallot . 
  and surgeons were the one to get the idea to use the pericardium to repair the defect . 
  could a machine get an idea like that , invent new surgical procedures ? 
  i doubt it . 
   surgeons and doctors will be mostly replaced with machines . 
  i can tell you with certainty that that 's never gon na happen . 
  maybe you 'll have surgeons operating by using machines , but operations without humans - not gon na happen . 
  just look at the rigorous testing process for new pharmaceutical drugs , only a few percent of which actually reach the market , now imagine a robotic operator - not only that , but surgeons would not agree to this , and ( at least in my country ) doctors are quite powerful politically . 
  more people than that are infected by measles in an unvaccinated group . 
  it 's highly contagious . 
  preventable , though . 
  that 's still a lot when you look at a population of a country . 
  a disease i 'd call rare is something like wegener 's granulomatosis and churg-strauss syndrome which have an incidence of 1 in 100 000 and 1 in 400 000 , respectively . 
  not to mention some children who get measels can develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis , a terminal complication with onset around age 20 which kills you within a year . 
  well , * you * obviously do n't if you 're putting up razor wire fences, 
  pretty much . 
  a lot of people in zagreb nowadays are from other parts of croatia and from herzegovina . 
  i would n't recommend swimming . 
  those rivers are notorious for whirlpools and swimmers drowning . 
  in croatia , ku\u0107a is house , dom is home and hi\u017ea is house in zagorje . 
  i do n't think anyone in croatia thinks in official language , i think it 's only used in documents and translation . 
  the capital , zagreb , mostly uses `` kaj '' due to centuries of influences from zagorje . 
  ( how 's it going ? ), 
  ( whatcha doing ? ), 
  ( what 's up ? 
  what has ) ), 
  do keep in mind most of croatia 's borders are rivers and mountains , not really easy to cross . 
  sava , danube , drava and the dinaric alps . 
  so the primary entrance point will probably be the green border around ilok ( and slavonia has minefields left from the homeland war ) and south border near cavtat and dubrovnik from montenegro . 
  we 're just gon na ignore the fact that the barbed wire fence killed wildlife ? 
  who cares about a few lynxes and brown bears , right ? 
  yes , but it is a part of external eu borders https://musingsofabrit.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/schengen.jpg, 
  since when is croatia not a part of external eu borders ? 
  ** croatia ** the parliamentary elections held on 8 november 2015 resulted in two major coalitions , croatia is growing ( center-left , sdp and prime minister zoran milanovi\u0107 ) and patriotic coalition ( center-right , hdz and the party chairman tomislav karamarko ) tied with 59 seats each , while the biggest surprise of the elections was most ( center , party chairman is bo\u017eo petrov ) which got 19 seats , though the number has shrunk due to some leaving . 
  most has stated it wants a national unity government or it will cause the country to have to repeat the elections in january 2016 . 
  without the support from most , neither of the big parties can have a majority in the parliament and thus can not form a goverment . 
  on monday , at 9 pm the president will begin the second round of consultations on the formation of a parliamentary majority , while at noon the esplanade hotel in zagreb will host a joint meeting by leaders of most , hdz and sdp , bo\u017eo petrov , tomislav karamarko and zoran milanovi\u0107 . 
  that meeting will be followed by their separate meetings with the president . 
  however , given the political positions of all parties involved in the negotiations , it is difficult to expect that president kolinda grabar-kitarovi\u0107 will be able to announce in the afternoon that someone has been named prime-minister designate , since that would require a support of at least 76 members of parliament . 
  `` we are calm , very calm '' , said yesterday one of the leading representatives of sdp 's croatia is growing coalition . 
  they estimate that , after an unsuccessful first sitting of the new parliament , they are closer to their ultimate goal than their opponents from hdz . 
  it is also significant that milanovi\u0107 , as opposed to karamarko , did not consider it necessary to talk to petrov in private before today 's meeting in zagreb . 
  for karamarko , a cause for concern could be the fact that more and more newspaper commentators which usually support him have begun calling on him to give the post of prime minister to most . 
  however , most have so far given no indication that 15 of their members of parliament may soon opt for a coalition with only one side . 
  anyway , the meeting will certainly not last very long , since most representatives have to be at the presidential office at 2 pm for their meeting with the president . 
  most has announced that it would continue to insist on a reform government with sdp and hdz , which milanovi\u0107 and karamarko resolutely refuse .
