  they are no longer who they were . 
  they died . 
  a professor once told me of a patient who was 30 , born without a brain , and in all 30 years she never opened her eyes , never moved , spoke , ... she was just breathing and heart was beating , but those are automated processes of the body . 
  she never saw her parents , because she lacked the organ to even understand and be aware of anything . 
  if you consider living like that `` human '' then we really have nothing to discuss . 
  de jure it was the case , but de facto when croatia voted 93 % for secession in the 1991 referendum ( 5 months after slovenia did the same ) , serbia invaded . 
  and then we have a woman with a niqab running for office - http://ba.n1info.com/a113241/vijesti/vijesti/indira-sinanovic-je-prva-zena-s-nikabom-kandidat-na-izborima.html i mean , i have nothing against someone 's religious clothing , but if i want to vote for someone i 'd at least like to see their face . 
  looking at it objectively since i 'm not a nationalist , after visiting calella and barcelona i found a newfound respect for our coastal cities . 
  3 months is probably set because it 's when neuronal proliferation ends . 
  before that , our brains lack a function , and our brains are what makes us human . 
  without a brain , we are just bundles of tissue in a human-shaped vessel . 
  so why is sweden killing racoon dogs and not wolves ? 
  as global warming causes mosquitoes to move more north , europe will be exposed to uncommon ( in the modern world ) african diseases such as [ dengue ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dengue_fever ) and [ chikungunya fever ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chikungunya ) or malaria . 
  hopefully our doctors will be ready . 
  i also prefer quiet times and do n't like football , but i have no problem with social drinking . 
  and since football is like a religion in our country , it can be annoying during championships . 
  i just do n't * feel * personally accomplished if our team scores a goal . 
  i prefer watching skiing , it 's much more intense because they can potentially fall at high speed . 
  maybe i 'll move to sweden when i finish college . 
  hopefully i 'll be able to find 1-2 friends , that 's enough ( as i hear , it 's notoriously difficult to make friends as an adult in sweden ) . 
  i will play when they implement the function of being able to see which pokestop ( real life location ) a pokemon is near . 
  i do n't have time to wander around town aimlessly for hours . 
  imagine how many km he could have made if he had pokemon go, 
  exactly . 
  but it 's always serbia and croatia and serbo-croatian on r/europe going on and on and on , it 's like the war never ended . 
  i 'm just tired of politics and everything . 
  i have no problem with serbia , my cousin 's from serbia . 
  i 'm not even a nationalist , i 'm a liberal . 
  but what irks me is that there are many examples of languages evolving naturally or politically and people only single out serbo-croatian like it can not become two languages , which is hypocritical to me . 
  and since i have n't encountered the term irl , i can not make myself believe the term for a language i speak is all of a sudden called something different . 
  it would be like changing the name of the language spoken in the us to `` american '' . 
  a : where are you from ? 
  b : i 'm from the us a : what language is the official language there ? 
  b : american . 
  a : you mean english ? 
  b : no , no , ** american ** . 
  that 's what serbo-croatian sound like to me . 
  like a made-up name . 
  i 'm talking about two nations ( denmark and norway ) , which once shared a language but nowadays do n't . 
  just to clarify . 
  nope , i never said it should be totally foreign , just a bit different . 
  for example , if i understand slovenian does that mean ( serbo - ) croatian and slovenian are the same language ? 
  quick , merkel , to the delorean !, 
  the reason i listed dano-norwegian is that they were mutually intelligible and the aforementioned was adopted as bokm\u00e5l in norway , while denmark changed its language to be more different than that . 
  yet nobody says how it was a political move . 
  so i 'm a bit irked by the hypocrisy . 
  just because you can read it does n't mean it 's not in croatian . 
  notice the words and grammar . 
  the point is that it 's written in croatian because it does n't use serbian words or grammar . 
  do n't be deliberately obtuse . 
  so , danish , norwegian and swedish are all the same language because they can understand each other ? 
  you learn something new every day ... s : jag tog t\u00e5get \u00f6ver bron till malm\u00f6 d : jeg tog toget over broen til malm\u00f8 n : jeg tok toget over brua til malm\u00f6, 
  really ? 
  learned something new . 
  i figured since future tense merges the verb `` htjeti '' with other verbs in serbian ( mora\u0107u , radi\u0107u vs croatian morat \u0107u , radit \u0107u ) that it also merges the particle `` ne '' . 
  mistake in my deduction , 
  https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/dundo_maroje/prvi_%c4%8din written by a croatian in the 16th century . 
  you 'll notice he uses tisu\u0107 ( u ) , not hiljadu . 
  exactly . 
  for example , [ dundo maroje ] ( https://hr.wikisource.org/wiki/dundo_maroje/prvi_%c4%8din ) by [ marin dr\u017ei\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marin_dr%c5%bei%c4%87 ) in 1551 . in ragusa ( dubrovnik ) was written in croatian . 
  dr\u017ei\u0107 had no ties to serbia , which at the time was [ under ottoman rule . 
  ] ( http://www.zum.de/whkmla/histatlas/europe/eu1550large.gif ), 
  is n't the last one kajkavian ? 
  also , beteg is kajkavian , comes from hungarian, 
  yup , i understand them . 
  but i 'm from zagreb and my grandparents are from zagorje , so it 's not that unusual . 
  90 % of young croatian people would not understand every part of this sentence . 
  the precentage would increase if it were written in cyrillic . 
  in croatian , it 's gramatically incorrect to write `` ne '' linked with verbs , with the exception of `` ne\u0107u '' . 
  so that would be `` ne seri '' and incorrect in a grammar school test . 
  maybe nowadays it kinda is , though there are differences . 
  but before yugoslavia , croatia and serbia had different languages and cultural heritage . 
  saying they have the same language when they historically developed in different geographical areas like two different nations could be called cultural erasure aimed at either nation . 
  i read a news report of people in northern serbia complaining how their kids were watching cartoons dubbed in croatian and now spoke croatian words . 
  furthermore , serbo-croatian for me is like dano-norwegian . 
  do people in denmark speak dano-norwegian ? 
  so the japanese should just decide to use only hiragana or katakana ? 
  yeah , it does . 
  it takes only a spark to ignite the powder keg which is the balkans . 
  especially with things like the [ probable republika srpska referendum ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposed_secession_of_republika_srpska ) and the possible failure of the [ dayton agreement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dayton_agreement ) you should really read up on the 1990 yugoslav wars ... 20 years is n't a long time for emotions to calm down . 
  and when things go south here , they tend to go south fast, 
  not whole , just around 60 % of voters who voted for hdz , a party which robbed croatia . 
  and about women rights , only 12 % of parliament members are women after this election , which is the lowest percentage since the 1990s . 
  but do offer proof of how enlightened and developed we are . 
  because i can offer a lot of the opposite . 
  article is on point about the state of affairs in croatia . 
  yeah , nationalism is totally not present in croatia . 
  a brief overview of the current state of affairs in croatia : https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/12/croatias-election-warning-nationalism-balkans-eu-government-second-world-war-fascism, 
  press f to pay respects, 
  funny enough , right now i ca n't remember any croatian rock bands except for [ majke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfcradvdbx8 ) , [ hladno pivo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuksho7_i2c ) and [ pun\u010dke ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2_ad11sgsm ) ... 
  well technically if you look at [ this topographical map of the balkans ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b6/balkan_topo_en.jpg ) only half of zagreb is in the balkans ... 
  funny enough , a lot of nationalists actually listen to that stuff . 
  it 's a bit hypocritical , really . 
  but if somebody likes that type of music and you tell him it 's not really your cup of tea , he may think you 're a nationalist because a lot of people link turbo folk with serbia , and if you do n't like turbo folk , you do n't like serbia and you must like listening to thompson . 
  i also do n't like listening to thompson , so there 's that . 
  why would it be their fucking job if they 're not a fucking part of the fucking schengen ? 
  do textbooks count ? 
  because i studied [ katzung & trevor 's pharmacology examination and board review ] ( https://www.amazon.com/katzung-trevors-pharmacology-examination-review/dp/0071789235 ) ( 600 pages of pure pharmacological pleasure , though even that was on an ipad ) for an exam , and when i spend the day reading professional literature , i 'd rather watch a movie or tv series/play a videogame/read manga that indulge into more heavy literature like tolstoy . 
  i think i read somewhere that balkan is defined as south of the sava river : http://portals.wi.wur.nl/register/images/sava_map.gif, 
  i do n't .
