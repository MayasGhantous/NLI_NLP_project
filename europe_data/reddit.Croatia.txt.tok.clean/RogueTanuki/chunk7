  a girl listening to turbo folk is a red flag for me . 
  and i 'm not a nationalist ( since that seems to be an argument , `` you do n't like serbian music '' ) , i listen to rock bands like [ ekatarina velika ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4d0yybajrc ) , i just hate the sound and the hillbilly mentality of people who listen to [ * cajke * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqypvsm1dvw ) ( `` give me a son under the casino lights '' , * quality lyrics * ... ) , and the howling of [ jelena rozga ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkatcmfcf6e ) and [ nives celzijus ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eop-c4aeyz0 ) . 
  i ca n't listen to that even ironically . 
  and at a point their ancestors were in the middle east , as it 's geographically the connection humans used when spreading from africa . 
  [ dr. house on nationalism ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kx3n3kdoewq ) ( just replace patriotism with nationalism , not the same but works here ), 
  i thought japan has [ huge problems ] ( http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2015/11/19/commentary/japan-commentary/japans-population-problem/#.v8qjcjh96hc ) with the fact that young people do n't have children and 1/3 of the population is older than 60 . 
  not helped by the fact that , as an island nation , the older japanese are a bit xenophobic towards the * gaijin * . 
  * slightly * bigger ? 
  just hokkaido is [ half the size of romania ] ( http://thetruesize.com/#?borders=1~!mtq5njy4odk.mtiwnty0mji*mjy0mdg3ndu ( mtgwndu5nti ~ ! jp * otc1nteynq.mtm2ntu3mte ) mw ) japan is bigger than germany . 
  i do n't think tesla was a nationalist, 
  although , tesla himself said `` i am equally proud of my serbian origin and croatian fatherland '' , since he was born in [ smiljan ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/smiljan ), 
  it will , everyone in croatia uses fgm-148 javelin , bosnia is just hipster so they use zolja :p, 
  i like the [ zvon\u010dari ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/zvoncari_viskovo_2008_9.jpg/800px-zvoncari_viskovo_2008_9.jpg ) , [ group picture ] ( http://www.tz-viskovo.hr/upload/images/0739.jpg ) and also the [ zrinski guard uniform ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/zrinska_garda_%c4%8cakovec_%28croatia%29_-_ulica_kr.tomislava.jpg ) ( though that 's more of a military uniform than a folk garment ), 
  are you living in zagreb ? 
  because we have several earthquakes every year , it 's just that most are quite mild . 
  however , there is a fault between \u017dumberak and medvednica which causes earthquakes , so zagreb is a high-risk area for earthquakes and the disaster unit warned that zagreb can expect a strong earthquake sometime in the future , which would most likely bring down a lot of old buildings in the city center . 
  having blue eyes is abnormal . 
  because having same sex parents will make the children gay . 
  * the children !! 1 ! 1 !, 
  self-defense depends on the situation . 
  unless you have reasonable suspicion that someone is trying to hurt you , you are n't allowed to hurt them . 
  also , afaik in croatia you 're only allowed to use the same means as the person attacking , so if an unarmed burglar breaks into your house and you shoot him , you 're guilty of murder . 
  we had a case in which an unarmed burglar broke into a house and was attacked by the owner 's dog and the burglar sued the owner and won because it was deemed excessive force on the owner 's part . 
  you 're forgetting the fact that most european countries follow civil law , not common law . 
  meaning that the judge reaches the verdict and does the sentencing . 
  only if the crime carries a penalty of imprisonment the judge has 2-3 jury members giving their opinion , but in the end the judge reaches the verdict . 
  i know that 's also mandatory in japan . 
  students there clean their own school , including the restrooms . 
  in croatia , when i went to elementary school in the early 2000s we changed our shoes to clean footwear in lower grades ( 1st , 2nd grade ) , and in higher grades and high school people do n't care . 
  it 's sad really to see how most peers do n't value school property , carving desks , sticking gum under chairs etc. 
  again , not to the police they do n't . 
  and you ca n't really compare eu and the us because eu has much stricter gun laws . 
  i 'm 21 and i 've never seen a gun in real life , except the one police carry on their belt . 
  i do n't feel like i 'm missing something that people in the us desperately want to hold on to . 
  values do n't matter . 
  laws do . 
  and i do n't think the police will handle the perp differently just because he thinks he 's right . 
  you 're behaving as if europe never had a mass shooting or a person shooting a weapon . 
  i know from the top of my head several examples from the last decade of a person who had a leftover gun from the yugoslav wars shooting someone or having a shootout with the police . 
  saying the police is n't `` used to this '' is a bit na\u00efve . 
  it 's their job to protect people , even if that includes brainwashed psychopats . 
  it 's the duty of the justice system to sentence a criminal , because if it was in the hands of the public , we 'd have public lynching for when an adult man has sex with an underage girl , but not when an adult woman has sex with an underage boy . 
  then he 's celebrated because he definitely `` wanted it '' . 
  by law , both of those adults are criminals and should be held accountable . 
  by public opinion in a lot of countries , the adult guy should be killed and the woman did nothing wrong , she was `` teaching the boy how to be a man '' . 
  but i went a bit off-topic here . 
  the point was , it 's the job of the police and the justice system to apprehend and sentence criminals . 
  freedom . 
   a gun is quite obviously a tool of killing and that is why gun control should be a thing . 
  also , tazing someone with a 50000 volts stun gun incapacitates them just as well as the bullet to the head . 
  increased the number of islands in the eu by 700 ... it 's something !, 
  probably in the lower leg , that avoids the femoral artery . 
  and because it 's an extremity and better than , for example , shooting a stomach , ripping through the intestine and potentially damaging the abdominal aorta and lumbar spine , along with potential sepsis from the gut bacteria in the intestinal contents mixing with the blood in the mesenteric veins . 
  why would it become more common ? 
  european police is quite effective in most countries . 
   could so , we 're gon na use a crystal ball in court ? 
  `` but mr. judge , he * could * have shot me . 
  he did n't shoot anyone , but he * could have * . '', 
  you * could * run over dozens of people in a car , but people still drive cars . 
  you could argue that a car is different than a gun because a gun 's primary purpose is to injure someone , but then that invalidates the common ` murican argument `` guns do n't kill people , people kill people '' .

  he 's talking about seafood ^ ;p, 
  yeah , nin 's nice , but you have to find a nice part of the beach . 
  because , if you go to the beach at sabunike , you 'll spend most of the time cleaning used cigarette buds from the sand , and since there are grass patches in the vicinity , there are also wasps and other flying insects . 
  and the beach is almost always full . 
  so , the best place to target is the sandy area between sabunike and nin laguna . 
  there are sandy beaches , you just have to find them, 
  my attempt : http://imgur.com/a/mvnuz i 'm so ashamed, 
  things might have been different if the kittens were hmrc officers ^ jk, 
  gestapo is an abbreviation for geheimlich staat polizei ( probably butchered the spelling cause it 's been a while since i studied german , it means `` secret state police '' , so the english version would be secstapo '', 
  belarus looks pretty good http://www.inteldevconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/minsk-642x360.jpg, 
  if i remember my german class correctly - the doctor was shot several times , rushed to surgery in critical condition but passed away , leaving behind two children . 
  the killer 's motives are unclear , but the police ruled out islamic terrorism . 
  when you 're 1.75 in croatia :(, 
  it is known, 
  turkey declaring war on the us would be like a guy with a stick trying to fight a tank . 
  the amount of people hating on pokemon go , saying people who play it should be institutionalized , here in croatia on social media is , frankly , astounding, 
  nope , croatian press also mentioned he enjoyed playing violent video games, 
  http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-comparison-detail.asp?form=form&amp;country1=russia&amp;country2=turkey&amp;submit=compare they could , but i do n't see why they would . 
  i mean , not that turkey is n't nice , but occupying a country in this day and age , especially a country with such a high amount of radical erdogan supporters ? 
  i 'm pretty sure not even the us would succeed . 
  that 's not really true . 
  as i small child , my mom told me i was afraid when x-files theme was playing on tv , and today when i hear that theme ( even though i like the show ) i feel anxious . 
  * katana in a backpack . 
  if someone tries to mess with you , just pull out a f $ & king katana, 
  do n't pokemon go and drive !, 
  they did n't specify * female * virgins ... 
  yeah , and also show movies like the conjuring to children , they 're nasty so that totally wo n't traumatise them . 
  why do n't they x-ray them ? 
  if you 're still growing ( younger than 18-19 ) you will have an epiphysial plate on the long bones . 
  adults will have an epiphysial line . 
  * cough * brexit * cough *, 
  and the us threatened to evict turkey from nato if they implement the death penalty ( which is a bit hypocritical tbh ), 
   cleanse a word never used by dictators ^ / s, 
  if you have better quality of life somewhere else , then move . 
  that 's why skilled educated people from the balkans move to the uk , germany , sweden , ... 
  your comment did n't specify you only implied democratic countries . 
  and also i 'm pretty sure there are a lot of people in north korea who would prefer democracy to starvation and death camps . 
  so if , for example , kim jong un was removed from power by the military wanting to institute democratically elected government in north korea , the democratic duty would be to oppose that ? 
  you 're not providing any arguments .
