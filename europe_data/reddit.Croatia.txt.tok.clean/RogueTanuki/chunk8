  biologically , humans are wired as social creatures which have a low to medium number of offspring with a single partner , and this has been true for hundreds of years , and this behaviour was also affected by epigenetic factors . 
  and no , men do n't just `` cum and are done '' if you 're speaking about men who want their child to survive , because it can be problematic for a pregnant woman to take care of herself , especially if she has a problematic pregnancy and needs to bed rest to keep the baby . 
  did n't one commenter say the coup was organised by a religious leader ? 
  i thought turkish army was secular, 
   a religious leader fethullah g\u00fclen is behind the coup  a religious leader secular democracy ? 
  secular and religious do n't mix . 
  i 'm crying from laughter here, 
  but if you kill off a huge number of men in a war , then there is a small number of men left , and also , you should assume they would n't have a lot of children with different women , if you consider paying child support for several women and the fact that nowadays most people are monogamous and those which are n't use birth control, 
  afaik , there were women soldiers in the partisans . 
  and there are women soldiers nowadays : http://abcnews.go.com/international/women-war-meet-female-peshmerga-fighters-taking-isis/story?id=39142160, 
  yes , because the pinnacle of humanity is killing other people because of their nationality to protect your nationality ? 
  are you hearing yourself ? 
  and what about medical students , future doctors ? 
  according to you , are they also supposed to kill people or ... ? 
   just because hitler killed 10,000,000 jews does n't mean he was always wrong . 
  yeah , i mean he * did * kill hitler . 
  source ? 
  i 'm pretty sure butcher shops existed in yugoslavia . 
  yeah , i do n't have that hostility . 
  people are people , regardless of the nationality . 
  even better if they fill out budget . 
  i 'm talking about yugoslavia , romania , bulgaria , ... 
  perhaps i 'm blind , but nowhere in my post do i see that i wrote that retired people should `` screw off '' ? 
  i do n't know where you got that idea ... 
  what country are you talking about ? 
  from what i hear , people did n't starve in yugoslavia , which was a communist country . 
  so , yes , the difference is the same before/after communism . 
  and yugoslavia , afaik , was relatively developed due to borrowing money during the period of 60s-80s . 
  rich old people ? 
  countries like spain , croatia have a high unemployment , but the environment is nice ... 
  the weather . 
   there is n't functioning black country on earth what about gabon ? 
  croatia : nothing of importance . 
  i thought serbia has gun control ? 
  actually , princip was a bosnian serb . 
  `` prepare yourself , for you will now witness my ultimate attack . '', 
  `` what 's his power level ? '', 
  `` it 's over 9000 !!! '', 
  * with a flash of light , an axe materialises in his hand and he starts flailing it about * `` allahuuuu akbarrrr !!!! '', 
  the article does n't specify , maybe it 's a gay couple ? 
  we do n't have to destroy the planet : http://fortune.com/2016/02/02/lab-grown-memphis-meats/ but also , if you 're saying that we should n't destroy the planet and improve the health of our species , the best way to do that would be for everyone to stop driving cars and start riding bicycles to work . 
  but realistically , that 's not going to happen . 
  sh * t , now i feel stupid for skimming over the title , i did n't realise it was just 1 day . 
  i thought all meals were changed to be vegetarian every day of the week . 
  yeah , 1-2 days a week is n't an issue . 
  yeah , i kinda remembered the difference between vegetarians and vegans too late during the writing of the post ... 
  yeah , i mean , red meat in large quantities is bad for health , afaik . 
  i would n't have a problem dropping red meat , but i love eating chicken . 
  i said it was interesting , not that it was true . 
  but the link you posted just discredited those scientists . 
  you ca n't have two such studies get diametrically opposite results . 
  and yeah , i wrote :  unless they 're eating eggs and dairy , in that case , it 's okay, 
  you should really read the whole thing before posting a comment . 
  i explicitly wrote :  unless they 're eating eggs and dairy , in that case , it 's okay, 
  i 'm thinking of moving to sweden after finishing med school . 
  so , are children forced to eat vegetarian in school , or can parents bake them a chicken breast and put it in a plastic container for them to eat ? 
  yes they will , because carbohydrates are turned into ffa , which are stored in the lipocytes . 
  gout appears in 0.5 % of population . 
  in many patients , it appears decades after having hyperuricemia . 
  it mostly affects men aged 20-60 , with a male to female ratio of 9:1 . 
  new studies have shown it is a multifactorial genetic illness . 
  primary gout is also present in lesch-nyhan syndrome and secondary gout is mostly caused by alcohol , some medicine ( diuretics ) , chronic kidney disease and hypertension . 
  it is treatable with alopurinol . 
  source : pathology textbook, 
  that 's because carbohydrates ( bread , potatoes , pastry ) cause hypertriglyceridemia , which in turn causes heart and blood vessel disease . 
  really ? 
  i 'm in croatia , in medical school , and i know maybe 1-2 people who are vegetarian . 
  most of my peers ( 21 y/o ) eat meat . 
  forgetting that a friend was vegetarian led to some awkward moments and apologizing when i forgot that she was and asked her if she tried the new burger in mcdonalds xd, 
  med student here , some vitamins like b12 are found in meat and not in vegetarian food . 
  are those children also going to be given supplements to account for that ? 
  personally , i 'm against this . 
  sure , have vegetarian meals if a child is vegetarian ( even though a responsible parent should n't raise a child as a vegetarian/vegan until puberty or later ) , but not for all kids without options . 
  when you 're adult and want to be a vegetarian , sure , be a vegetarian , and also take vitamin supplements to account for those you 're not getting from meat . 
  but raising your child without meat is bad for your child , because it can have stunted development ( * unless * they 're eating eggs and dairy , in that case , it 's okay . ), 
  imho , it would be more important to eat less carbohydrates than meat . 
  carbohydrates are the main cause of obesity , which is the main killer in western world , leadind to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes . 
  also , an interesting study , dunno how accurate it is :  our study has shown that austrian adults who consume a vegetarian diet are less healthy ( in terms of cancer , allergies , and mental health disorders ) , have a lower quality of life , and also require more medical treatment . 
  therefore , a continued strong public health program for austria is required in order to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors . 
  moreover , our results emphasize the necessity of further studies in austria , for a more in-depth analysis of the health effects of different dietary habits .

  1 euro is 7.5 kuna, 
  hey , i 'd like not having to exchange money when going to austria as much as the next guy , but i still feel uneasy about the potential downside of adopting the euro . 
  though , we could edit the background of the coins , for example , 1 $ with the marten on the background ( 1 kuna ) and 2 $ with brown bear on the background ( 5 kuna ) . 
  that would make the change not drastic in people 's minds , methinks . 
  nope , at least not in croatia , from what people tell me . 
  independence will become for the uk what freedom is for the us, 
   croatia is now known as the cool spot to go to this is a problem b/c our economy mainly relies on summer tourism , and if some radicals decide to do several terrorist attacks since we have n't had any so far , that could wreak havoc on our economy ... 
  i tried to be as objective as possible in the 20th century period : 7th century ad - croats arrive to the current location ( there are slavic and iranian origin theories , but i wo n't get into that ) 1102 - pacta conventa , personal union of croatia and hungary ( we do n't talk about krbava and mohacs ) 1527 - parliament of cetin , croatia joins the habsburg monarchy 1593 - [ battle of sisak ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_sisak ) , ottomans repeled 1712 - pragmatic sanction , legalising female heir to the throne 1835 - [ illyrian movement ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/illyrian_movement ) 1848 - ban ( viceroy ) jela\u010di\u0107 abolishes serfdom 1918 - [ kingdom of serbs , croats and slovenes ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_yugoslavia ) ( * kingdom * of yugoslavia ) 1941 - [ `` independent '' state of croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independent_state_of_croatia ) , when we were under nazi rule , a blight on our history which some ignorant radical right-wingers glorify due to it being first `` independence '' since 1102 union with hungary ( if you can call being a nazi puppet state `` independence '' ) 1945 - [ socialist federal republic of yugoslavia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/socialist_federal_republic_of_yugoslavia ) a great idea if all of the constituent nations would be considered equal , but the problem is , after a few decades serbian politicians decided to promote serbian nationalism , which led to : 1991 - [ republic of serbian krajina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_serbian_krajina ) ( unrecognised state within croatia ) and the [ declaration of independence ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/independence_of_croatia ) 1995 - [ operation storm ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm ) , final battle of the war of independence ( largest single land battle in europe since ww2 ) and the erdut agreement , which marked the end of the war 2009 - croatia joins the nato 2013 - croatia joins the eu, 
  thing is , once the national currency is replaced by the euro , the price of goods and services increase . 
  we 've seen it happen before . 
  and we do n't really want stuff to become more expensive . 
  reminded me of this : https://youtu.be/g8rksqf_hpi, 
   you can pay a polish guy # 300 a week , and them ask for # 200 of that back at the end of the month if you let him stay on your premises . 
  that sounds like feudalism, 
  he probably does n't know who this is : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marie_curie, 
  i would bet you 20 pounds you could n't distinguish and sort 10 different people correctly in the categories you wrote . 
  so does eastern europe include croatia and slovenia or the baltic states or is it just countries like poland and romania ? 
  genuinely curious, 
  actually , i remember reading this year will be the first in i do n't know how many thousands of years where arctic ice cap will completely melt .
