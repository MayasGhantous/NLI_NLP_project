  so , no ice there :(, 
  nukeless, 
  if i were british and the side i agreed with won , i 'd have no problem letting it be revoted in a supermajority vote , especially if it 's something this huge . 
  if neither side ca n't get more than 60 % , then it 's best to leave the entire thing alone . 
  downvotes ( probably ) incoming . 
  so if a doctor from canada gets a job in a british hospital and lives in the uk for a number of years , he ca n't get a citizenship ? 
  interesting ... 
  well , if 17400000 voted to leave and there were 44722000 registered voters in 2015 in the uk , then 39 % voted to leave , not 50 % . 
  [ mfw ] ( http://imgur.com/4oqmshs ) i support federalization of europe , but do you seriously believe it 's a realistic goal with all the nationalists in all of the member states ? 
  really , so a person from canada ( it 's in the commonwealth , right ? ), 
  ca n't fly to the uk and request british citizenship ? 
  example - nsdap ( nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei , with the endearing nickname `` the nazi party '' ) was democratically elected in the 1930s germany , bringing adolf hitler into power . 
  and that did n't quite turn out well , with the holocaust and all ... 
   we buy far , far more from you than you buy from us . 
  you * do * realize that this means you 're economically more dependant on eu than the eu is on the uk , right ? 
  gee , i wonder if some other country did an ass move today ... hmmmm ... / s, 
  when i see the british flag with that line and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dwexeyu.gif ) pops into my mind, 
  there really are better examples of poor eu countries than [ slovakia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tatra_tiger ) but nice try, 
  that ca n't be true , seriously ? 
  because everyone knows a good vote is the one where you use your emotions to make a decision ^ / s, 
  look at the bright side , you have the most awesome flag in europe . 
  ( saw it a few days ago in a football cafe full-size , that dragon looks awesome ), 
  i ca n't believe you just used that obvious straw man fallacy xd, 
  there are historical examples of a currency losing value and staying down , albeit not in circumstances like these . 
  japanese yen , for example . 
  oh i 'm pretty sure an economic union of 27 countries can handle itself better than a single country . 
  okay , you keep that optimism  you 'll need it . 
  i 'd say a 12 % drop compared to the usd is pretty bad from a modern economic viewpoint . 
  it 's like you do n't realize the economic repercussions this will have for both the uk and the eu ... 
  i 'm guessing because spain has some provinces ( basque , catalonia ) which would want to declare independence , so if scotland declared independence from the uk and spain supported scotland 's eu membership , it would be like giving its own provinces the green light to seceede . 
  i might be wrong , though . 
   saw kids doing drugs in london  assumes every one of several million british kids do drugs top kek, 
  you know what 's hilarious ? 
  the value of your currency , 
  2/3 majority vote, 
  i think for important matters such as this , a 2/3 majority should be needed . 
  the value of the pound fell 12 % in relation to the usd, 
  http://imgur.com/2vb9gg6 that 's what 51,9 % of them wanted . 
  and i still think a referendum like this should need a 2/3 majority . 
  well that 's what brexiters wanted http://imgur.com/2vb9gg6, 
  and you 're right , the battle of mohacs was also cringeworthy , but that was also together with hungarian troops ( if i remember correctly one of the commanders died when he fell in a pond in a suit of armor which dragged him underwater and he drowned ), 
  you 're implying i find tbbt funny , which i do n't . 
  and also tbbt 's humor is different than humor in last week 's tonight . 
  it 's easier if you 're the same eu member , less bureaurocratic problems . 
  * nation 's and yes , some events like krbava battle were cringeworthy . 
  no , i 'm talking that if , for example , norway becomes an eu member , and has a lack of doctors , it can employ doctors from other eu members without a lot of bureaurocratic problems . 
  not everyone has the same sense of humor , but since he 's clearly so popular , a lot of people share mine, 
  i 'm seriously hoping your 3rd item on the list is n't you indirectly supporting a killing of a person for her beliefs because if you are that 's really disturbing . 
  dunno if it 's different in austria , but when croatia joined the eu , we actually voted for our eu representatives . 
  and we also know our representatives . 
  compared to croatian and bosnian humor , john oliver is hilarious, 
  i just rewatched that video and ca n't find a strawman argument you mentioned , can you elaborate ? 
  all of the arguments are supported by evidence . 
  and what makes you think he does n't understand the refugee crisis but you do ? 
  well , you have a point , but there 's also brain drain . 
  just by being a better economy and people making more money , there 's a tendency for educated workers ( doctors , it specialists , etc. ), 
  to immigrate in developed countries , so the open labour market actually benefits the more developed countries . 
  and a problem is , a lot of people who tend to be right-wing , do n't take him seriously . 
  you can look at a statement in two ways . 
  no , intelligence agencies will . 
  that video is * so * cringeworthy, 
  nope , croatia joined ( if i remember correctly ) in 2013 and my peers ( 18-20 years ) agree that eu is good for the economy and regulations , especially if the government and institutions are corrupt - you can always appeal to a european court and you can go study or work in another eu country . 
  i believe grounding children and taking away their tv/video game privileges are more effective than spanking . 
  `` do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material . '', 
  leviticus 19:19 hopefully you only have 100 % cotton clothes at home , amirite ? 
  but ca n't the uk hold another referendum 10-20 years later to rejoin if they see they are n't better off outside the eu ? 
  ( i.e. 
  when old voters croak , pardon my french ), 
  nah , i do n't think there 's much animosity there . 
  also , if bosnia would actually build the a1 highway , you 'd be there in half the time : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/a1_ ( bosnia_and_herzegovina ) croatia has a lot of nice cities , one of my favourites is rovinj , i think it looks awesome on a peninsula . 
  but dalmatia is also great because there 's access to many national parks such as krka and paklenica . 
  problem is when tourists do n't get informed and then we get news like `` czech tourists rescued/died after going on an evening climb on mt.
