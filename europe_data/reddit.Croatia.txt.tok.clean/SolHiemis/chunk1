up there , mountains burn worse than mountains burn down there . 
  honestly , speeds over 200 km/h are n't really necessary over here , because the distances are smallish . 
  if the tracks between major cities in ex-yu were all upgraded to 120-200 speeds that would be more than satisfactory . 
  zagreb-belgrade would be something in the lines of 4-5 hours . 
  the current situation is an outrage , though . 
  zagreb-rijeka 4 hours by train , 2:15 by bus . 
  zagreb-split - 6 hours by train , 4:30 by bus . 
  the dugo selo-novska line ( major international corridor ! ), 
  is single track with 60-80 km/h . 
  i could go on and on . 
  well , since the difference is only 9cm ( russian gauge 1524 mm , standard gauge 1435 mm ) , the tsar must 've been a very frustrated man . 
  trains are way more energy-efficient . 
  kolo-voz -  wagon-driving . 
  it 's descriptive . 
  not widespread , we 're too close to the vatican for that . 
  the standard gauge is the standard because it is the most used worldwide , but there is no standard electrification . 
  most countries use 25 kv/50 hz , * but * it is by no means standard . 
  belgium , italy ( except for new-built high-speed lines ) , slovenia , parts of the czech republic , poland and spain use 3 kv dc ; germany , austria , switzerland , sweden and norway use 15 kv/16 ,7 hz ; france ( except lgv ) and the netherlands use 1500 v dc and southeastern england is electrified with 750 v dc , collected from a third rail !, 
  yes indeed , 25 kv is commonplace for new-built high-speed lines , but if it 's going to be 200 km/h they might as well use the existing systems through each country and switch locomotives or pantographs on the borders . 
  it will be interesting to see if the tracks will be 1435 mm standard gauge ( nominal gauge in germany and poland ) or 1524 mm russian gauge ( the nominal gauge used in the two baltic countries , estonia and finland ), 
  five . 
  no more , no less . 
  act one : reckless spending act two : austerity act three : tsipras ' election , negotiation , referendum - it has just culminated with the resignation . 
  acts four and five are yet to be written . 
  using that new word , eh ? 
  actually it says `` kosovo je srbija '' ( kosovo is serbia ) . 
  we have n't even gotten a grant approved yet , let alone for construction to actually get going . 
  i 'm way less optimistic than you , i 'd say 15 years at best . 
  yay for pitch accents !, 
  their little strip of the coast , while nice on our part , simultaneously poses a huge logistical problem for croatia , because if you look at a map , that strip splits croatia in two . 
  and people wishing to go from the north bit to the south bit ( which is a big touristical region , especially cultural tourism with dubrovnik and kor\u010dula and whatnot ) need to either pay for a small-ish ferry that runs once about every two hours , or cross the outside border of the eu twice , which means to be inspected and re-inspected . 
  the queues on the border crossings in the summer are mythological , and they will get even worse when we enter the schengen area . 
  because when you 're guarding the border of an open area which , if one enters , they could travel all the way to troms\u00f8 without answering business or pleasure , you really need to be careful . 
  plans to build a 2,5 km bridge from the north bit to the south bit have existed for as long as i can remember , and it 's always brought up in pre-election times as means to collect political points , and the founding stone has been laid about 4-5 times so far , by interchanging pms . 
  none of it 's happened , of course , and the construction is still going nowhere . 
  it 's likely that bosnia & herzegovina will sooner join schengen than we build that bridge . 
  ** americans ** yap all the time and your nerves hit overdrive already at the station . 
  they do n't speak a sentence without inserting at least two words and you understand why one of us succeeds in the foreign world . 
  they first heard of croatia playing a board game . 
  six of them got together and one of them painted the world map for this year 's pre-college destinations for the group . 
  his finger also caught the neighbouring nations , but unlike bosnia & herzegovina and serbia , croatia is on the sea . 
  they 've never heard of neum . 
  they googled our entired history from the 7th century onwars on the plane , checked how much for the whores and food and they 're amazed that we know what wi-fi is . 
  you send them away before you 've reached the apartment . 
  croatia : outright illegal . 
  should be legalised and taxed . 
  almost everyone over here has their savings and loans in either euro or chf , the latter of which often causes public turmoil because of the unstable exchange rate , and prices of very expensive stuff , such as housing and cars , are often expressed in euro , but the kuna is still in public use , despite being more-or-less informally pegged to the euro , so i do n't think i 'd miss the kuna . 
  i 'm guessing euros . 
  unrelated to formula 1 . 
  if dorna agrees ( and it probably will , seeing that motogp is about 50 % spanish these days ) , the catalan gp will go on . 
  as far as i recall there is still a belgian grand prix . 
  on another note , do n't mix fia and cvc . 
  fia is the international automobile federation and they 're the body that sanctions the sport , posts the stewards , awards the trophies , writes the rulebook etc. 
  it is presided by jean todt . 
  the cvc , however , is the main shareholder of formula 1 , and its subsidy , formula one management , is the body whose ceo is bernie ecclestone . 
  they are the ones in charge of promoting the sport , they are the ones who arrange races in various countries and * they * are the ones who are held responsible for destroying the sport by pushing for racing in petro-dollar countries and in the far east , where the grandstands are always empty , while simultaneously discontinuing races with the highest attendances , such as the french , european and german gps . 
  word has it next in line is the italian gp . 
  how did they do it ? 
  bernie claims his life motto to be : * `` you can get anything you want , just pay more than it 's worth . 
  * and that 's exactly what he did . 
  he raised the costs of bringing f1 to a country so much that european circuits could no longer afford it . 
  bernie is also good buds with hermann tilke , the guy who has designed every single new circuit in f1 since 1999 . 
  and they are all pretty much the same . 
  not to say there have not been good races there , bahrain and china generally provide good racing , but . 
  the majority of formula one fans are in europe , yet only 7 races out of 19 are held in europe , with as much held in asia , with - you guessed it - empty-ish stands . 
  an exception to this is the japanese gp , which is always packed , as it damn well should be . 
  ** tldr ** : the fia is not that bad . 
  bernie is a decrepit jerk . 
  formula 1 has moved away from where it should be , and that is in its cradle . 
  is it an investor-repellant if s&p lists you as ` junk ' ? 
  oops . 
  i 'll have my redraw , posted below , 
  the entirety of syrmia should be croatian clay . 
  you forgot rijeka . 
  something something 1868 . 
  remove the crown from the coat of arms and i 'm good . 
  yes . 
  croatia is 36th . 
   the church might have an impact on voting according to our constitution , election day ( or any other voting day ) is a public holiday , and as all sundays are public holidays all elections and referenda are held on sundays . 
  and the church has a great impact on voting , with 60 + % of croats being practicing catholics . 
  get a sermon to vote against the ( leftist ) abhorrations of natural law and then flock out to the polls to vote . 
  did i mention that my polling station is next door to the church ? 
  we held a presidential election this winter , and two weeks before the first round of voting the archbishop of zagreb ( i.e. 
  the bigboss in croatian religion ) circulated a message to all the priests and their parishes in his archdiocese that was to be read at all daily services . 
  the message contained guidelines on voting ( between only four candidates , for that matter ) - we should elect someone who will stand by our constitutional definition of marriage ( defined as a union of a woman and a man since 2013 , courtesy of media attention and the roman catholic church ) , someone who will protect croatia against all abhorrations of natural law ( against homosex ) and who will strengthen the ties between croatia and the holy see ( which are already too strong , imo , croatia has a contract with the holy see according to which croatia pays a fixed rate to the holy see every year as reparations for all damage done to the church in the years of socialism , roman catholicism is the only religion that can be taught at schools , the rcc is the only religious organisation that can own land etc. ), 
  also according to our constitution , article 41 , paragraph 2 :  all religious organisations are equal before the law and separated from the state . 
  firefox reporting in . 
  i 've tried chrome ( and chromium-based stuff ) , ie , opera , and firefox still feels and works best for me . 
   16gb ram  only wtf , i have 4gb and feel i 'm in the upper half . 
  croatia , search in croatian : abortion . 
  d'you know what ? 
  i 'd like to see one for this weekend , given the finnish elections . 
  this looks like it was written for croatia . 
  change a few bits here and there and it will absolutely reek of us . 
  hopefully , your politicians are not the corrupt crooks they are in croatia ? 
  half of the former government is in prison , convicted of corruption , and the mayor of the capital just spent four months off-duty while under investigation . 
  yes . 
  ( catholic country though ), 
  zagreb 's winters are shit . 
  the temperatures hover around 0 \u00b0 c so snow either melts right away , then freezes overnight or catches on and then melts to slush .
