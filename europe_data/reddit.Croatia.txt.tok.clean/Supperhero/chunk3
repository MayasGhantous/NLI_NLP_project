  that takes time . 
  i 'd much sooner raise the voting age than lower it . 
  actually , yes it is ... 
  that 's ridiculously adorable . 
  we are of stealth !, 
  sneaky attack wealthy kapitalist while no expect !, 
  get much clay . 
  how they retaliate when not know we exist ? 
  i 'm fairly sure he was joking . 
  really , at that level , you do n't want to be using percentages , just say `` over 20 times '' or `` by a factor of 20.7 '' or something . 
  ^ i 'm ^ not ^ jealous ... ^ ^ croatia ^ ^ is ^ ^ doing ^ ^ fine ... ^ ^ ^ ^ we 've ^ ^ ^ ^ grown ^ ^ ^ ^ by ^ ^ ^ ^ at ^ ^ ^ ^ least ^ ^ ^ ^ 10 % ^ ^ ^ ^ in ^ ^ ^ ^ the ^ ^ ^ ^ same ^ ^ ^ ^ time ... ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ damnit ... 
   modern crossbow sounds like an oximoron to me , but i guess such things do exist ... 
  iirc , he shot the teacher first , then her daughter who was in the same class ( targeted ) then the second teacher who came to see what the commotion was . 
  the second teacher died , the first teacher and her daughter lived . 
  how is no one asking the obvious question ? 
  how the hell does a 13 year old boy manage to shoot three people with a crossbow in a school ? 
  let me remind you , crossbows need to be wound up and loaded . 
  this does not take a short amount of time . 
  how did this go down ? 
  did he shoot the professor and then just stand there , winding up the crossbow while everyone waited for him to finish winding it up ? 
  then he shoots it , and then he winds it up and loads it again . 
  again without being stopped by anyone . 
  it just seems so ridiculous . 
  does anyone have details on this ? 
  why was n't he stopped before shooting it three times ? 
  why would you want to extract shale gasses in this market ? 
  shale extraction is n't profitable when oil prices are low . 
  also , fracking has been pretty much proven to contaminate underground water sources . 
  there were articles going around reddit , but i ca n't recall the names of the posts . 
  what do you think that post proves ? 
  you 've provided a list that shows that pretty much every country in europe has insufficient birth rates ... 
  the minimum for sustainability is 2,1 or so iirc . 
  even in perfect conditions the minimum for sustainability ( 0 growth ) is 2.0 which only two countries have . 
  by your logic , being a prosperous region , europe should have positive birth rates . 
  if you 're implying that the list shows that richer countries have higher birth rates then you 're being silly . 
  there is a weak correlation but it 's obvious that there are greater forces at play . 
  the reason the correlation is apparent at all is because you 've selected a sample where all the other variables are very similar ( european countries are culturally relatively similar ) . 
  by that logic africa would have the lowest birth rates . 
  i do n't think politicians wages should be too high . 
  they should be good salaries but not extravagant . 
  i actually do n't want your hypothetical person to become a politician if their main criteria for deciding their profession is salary . 
  you 'll never be able to pay them as much as other people will be able to bribe them . 
  you want the people in government to be motivated by other things . 
  ideally , altruism and a desire to change things for the better , realistically prestige and social status . 
  this makes for better leaders . 
  i have had a 8 mbps connection for the last 5 or 6 years and the only thing that changed is the price . 
  i 'm paying a bit more now . 
  that 's also the highest connection speed available where i live , which is the 2nd largest city in croatia . 
   how antisocial the nordic societies are . 
  you 're just making it sound even better ... 
  i ai n't got time to socially interact with everyone ( almost anyone ) . 
  does n't anyone find it weird how low the percentages for english are ? 
  here in croatia i do n't know anyone under the age of 60 who does n't know english . 
  is n't english a mandatory subject in schools in other countries as well ? 
   which is the `` good '' party ? 
  oh my sweet summer child ... 
  excluding tibet , china ( or chinese states , as china has fallen apart several times after the ruling dynasty lost the `` mandate of heaven '' only to be reunited again ) has held mostly the same territory for thousands of years , much longer than the communist party existed . 
  we 're really not so different . 
  if you look around the world there are countless examples of countries that are much more diverse ethnically . 
  just one example is china . 
  most people think of them as being all the same but they have a whole range of cultures and languages inside the country . 
  they 're also huge which means that , administratively , it 's much harder to keep that large a nation together . 
  compared to them and a lot of other countries , the people of yugoslavia were fairly homogeneous . 
  our problems we 're of a different sort . 
  religion , corruption , a surge in nationalism . 
  why the fuck would you display three decimals ? 
  who decided that two decimals would n't be precise enough and that the third decimal needed to be displayed ? 
  fucking graphical designers playing at math ... 
   the question is what it ca n't destabilize europe . 
  despite the title , this is not actually an average day in croatia . 
  if you designed turbines for this kind of wind , you would n't be getting much energy from them . 
  errr , and you do n't think that ? 
  you do n't think you 're at risk of getting a cold if you , for example , go out naked into the snow ? 
  this is a ridiculous and clearly staged video . 
  there 's not that many people in slovenia . 
  just as an fyi , it 's croatian/croatians . 
  i do actually agree with you about negotiating with terrorists , though not negotiating with terrorists and blowing up hostages is hardly the same thing . 
  could you be more reductionist ? 
   even at 50 meters , without ear protection , an assault rifle is so loud it makes your ears bleed no , no it does n't . 
  if it did , it would be a pretty shitty weapon for war . 
  soldiers going deaf as soon as they use the weapon . 
  and soldiers ca n't really afford to wear ear muffs in battle . 
  kinda need to hear what 's happening around you . 
  this is dangerous for other reasons . 
  what goes up must come down . 
  i do n't own a gun and no one in my family does . 
  of all my friends i know only one whose family owns a gun . 
  it depends on where in the country you live , of course , but , as a rule , we really do n't have a problem with gun violence . 
  on the other hand , you do get drunk people at weddings shooting kalashnikovs into the air in the rural areas . 
  that 's where the guns are . 
   on jan. 10 , diyanet was reported to have announced that anyone having an abortion should donate 5 camels or ** 221 grams of gold ** . 
  not a gram more or less !, 
  i actually heard quite a lot about belgium this year . 
  it 's just that all of it was bad . 
  thing is , we do have a separatist movement in istria , though not terribly strong . 
  of course it 's not 1cm . 
  a 1cm wire is n't a wire , it 's a bar . 
  i find it hilarious how hungarians perceive that 7 % of their population is muslim when 0.1 % is . 
  i think this does a good job of showcasing how prone to exaggeration people are when they fear something . 
   most russian girls look like this .
