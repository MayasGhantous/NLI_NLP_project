hence the `` surprisingly '' . 
  because working class and petite bourgeoisie croats take a substantial amount of pride in being `` german backed '' , signaling germany 's ally position in the yugoslav conflict ( and , errrm , other , earlier conflicts ) and the fact that the socialist period created a class of `` went to germany as a gastarbeiter ( guest worker ) , made some money , now i have this car and big house and my mother is proud '' thinkers . 
  combine this with a leftover regression to the `` old vienna '' kind of dignified agrarian living , the role of german and austrian tourists for our economy , and the fact that every other language could be interpreted as pro-gay ( germany is surprisingly not conceived as a liberal mecca by the hardline right ) , and there 's your antwort !, 
  dubrovnik republic motherfuckerssss !, 
  also , i hated how milanovi\u0107 's list of 15 worthy croats of the past included zero women . 
  shut up , serb . 
  yeeaaaah , not * really * . 
  a lot of people miss it , but few ( if you take away the delusional over-65s ) would advocate for a re-yugoslavization , all things considered . 
  i mean , it 's like saying `` would n't it be great if we could re-divide germany , but this time do it properly '' . 
  nostalgia = / = reality . 
  i honestly ca n't comprehend that we are neighbors . 
  as a croat man , i 'm always confused as to whether or not i should feel compassion for serbian ptsd victims . 
  from seeing it all around me in croatia , i truly feel for them and ( even more ) their families , but there is always a little part of me quietly asking `` well why did you decide to attack in the first place ? '', 
  god , this is all so difficult . 
  : - / i honestly do n't know if we ( and by we i mean the populations of bosnia , croatia and serbia ) will ever be able to lead lives without the constant pressure of anger and/or guilt . 
  hahaha , it 's amazing to see it said so straightforwardly . 
  :') i 'm 22 and they have been talking about a bridge , a land overpass , a constant ferry service ( !, 
  ) , annexing bosnia , selling dubrovnik to cruiser companies and many other solutions for as long as i can remember . 
  perfect . 
  right on my birthday !, 
  absolutely not . 
  violent opposition everywhere east of berlin . 
  i love how everyone is fine with one or two countries going into an incredible spending spree for an event such as this cause its worth it for the `` football fever '' , but when eurovision does it it 's `` wasteful spending '' . 
  serbia got bombed because of the never ending disputes over all the territories that separated . 
  serbia got bombed for kosovo . 
  it 's not like they were like `` let 's hit em extra hard for srebrenica !, 
   most people native to that land have issued bulgarian passports can you find me a source for this , please ? 
  i 'm very interested !, 
  oh , also :  and all of greece is rightfully theirs this seems like an exaggeration on your part , but if you can source it , i 'd be super greatful !, 
  thanks . 
  well , i learnt about cyril and methodius ' glagolitic-to-cyrilic invention in both my histroy classes in croatia , and my linguistics classes in oxbridge and the ivies . 
  i hardly doubt they 're pro-macedon freaks , and they all casually mentioned the alphabet stemming from ohrid , today in macedonia . 
  `` but it was in bulgaria back then !!! '', 
  / cue infinite argument loop /, 
  `` no proof besides assumption '' when talking about historically sourced materials but it 's ok to retroactively debate ethnicity ?!, 
  come on . 
  38b0de has a good point !, 
  you are aware that some of us had to do that for * literally * a millenium ? 
  i think americans would answer in such a way if you asked them where they 're * from * , and only if you asked them as a fellow american or in the us , but americans do identify as americans on a nation-level , no ? 
  me neither . 
  kind of a bummer . 
  : - / apparently , we got invaded by hungary . 
  who knew !, 
  i know that 's not what this article is about , but `` gay issues '' immediately made me think of textbooks with chapter titles such as `` what if he always wants to bottom ? '', 
  or `` the everyday guide to enemas '' . 
  brb going to hell . 
  source : i 'm fully gay . 
  see , the thing is , my italian friend , that the first and the second part of your comment are totally opposed to each other , with a rather negative outcome at the end . 
  what if i were to say : i love german culture and politics although i should n't because they burned people alive and they killed children and they were disgusting selfish monsters and a parasite onto the world , although i do n't * really * care about that stuff cause it 's ~ different ~ now . 
  by making statements like these , you ** perpetuate ** all those old-fashioned behaviors and stances you claim to be against . 
  yes , croatian nazis fucked over many an italian fascist . 
  * hey , not all italians were fascist !!, 
  * yes . 
  and not all croatians were nazis . 
  so let 's just drop it . 
  one teen agnostic balkan gay male reporting to duty here !, 
  i know what he meant , but it 's still a completely unnecessary and non-progressive way to think . 
  it 's demonization and prejudice against a country who really needs the opposite of that if it is ever to reconcile its past . 
  good luck trying to integrate us in 10-15 years or so , i 'm sure we 'll cooperate then . 
  idiots . 
  yes , just as it is `` kinda strange '' to see someone in italy calling mussolini an idiot . 
  grow up . 
  well , serb cro bos are largely eurosceptic and precisely for this reason . 
  when croatia had the accession referendum last year , the govt actually had to air promo videos where an everyday-joe is being told why entering the eu is n't like joining a new yugoslavia . 
  balkan-wide as well . 
  `` ca n't you get over it ? '', 
  is what i hear from most euro fanatics . 
  after the fall of the roman empire , it was self-imposed . 
  this is excellent advice !, 
  are you aware that we had done this for over a thousand years ? 
  and that since then , probably 85 % of countries rebeled against it , sometimes with bloody wars ? 
  source : latin . 
  i 'd suggest you create a `` skeleton '' with the europass web builder , and then make it prettier and nicer looking in word . 
  whooooooosh !, 
  nope , we had elected representatives in the hungarian-through-yugoslav parliaments , a bunch of them even . 
  they just could n't do anything . 
  * no hard feelings , but let me assure you that your issues , which have cost both sides ( if only there were only two sides lol ) hundreds of human lives , let me assure you that those issues are really not important issues at all . 
  and somehow this should make you happy . 
  * ftfy, 
  ** disclaimer !, 
  federosceptism ahead and/or ramblings of a bummed out 23yo slav . 
  ** back in high school , we spent almost four years of history class studying the different political circumstances under which croatia found itself from 1100 until 1990 . 
  first the ** hungarians ** came , and we signed a treaty with them to create a `` personal union '' . 
  like , a legit union of two states , which is fine . 
  but it turned out to be a bad idea as they took over sovereignty and feudalism was shittier for us and so on , but , hey , at least we got to keep control over education , internal and religious affairs !, 
  then hungarians became unbearable , so we all turned to the ** habsburgs ** , and proudly , sovereignly , bravely , bla bla , we agreed to a deal with them , * sharing * our sovereignty in return for protection and prosperity . 
  and we kinda lost everything again , but hey , we still had education , internal affairs and religion under our control !, 
  we 're still in charge of ourselves !, 
  then the habs became unbearable , so we revolted against them , shot some of them , and joined a nice mutually-respected union with the ** serbs and the slovenes ** . 
  eventually , serbia got to control our armies , trade and policy , but , hey , we still had education , internal and religion !, 
  then things got so unbearable , we fucking turned to ** hitler ** . 
  with him we struck a fab deal , got all we wanted , a nice little country , but without real power . 
  take a wild guess , what areas of govt did we keep ? 
  then that failed too , so we went back to our slavs and tried out ** socialism ** . 
  i mean , it 's literally based on all parts being equal . 
  how wrong could that be !, 
  well , at one point , we were almost content with being able to keep religion , internal and education , but then the party started messing with that too , and everyone went mad . 
  so we killed each other . 
  * again * . 
  and then we were ** free ** .
