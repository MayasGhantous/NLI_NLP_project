  i mean , it 's just schengen + erasmus + structural funds , right ?

  i do n't know how it is in wallonia , greenland , or wales , but over here , things like these never worked out for the little guy . 
  and that makes me scared a bit , cause so many people died 20 years ago and had no idea that this is ahead . 
  but hey , i 'm not a pessimist . 
  if i could report back to this post in 10 years , after all of barroso 's vision is in place , i know exactly what i 'd say : * dude , do n't worry , it 's fine , we totally have education , religion and internal . 
  ** disclaimer !, 
  federosceptism ahead and/or ramblings of a bummed out 23yo slav . 
  ** back in high school , we spent almost four years of history class studying the different political circumstances under which croatia found itself from 1100 until 1990 . 
  first the ** hungarians ** came , and we signed a treaty with them to create a `` personal union '' . 
  like , a legit union of two states , which is fine . 
  but it turned out to be a bad idea as they took over sovereignty and feudalism was shittier for us and so on , but , hey , at least we got to keep control over education , internal and religious affairs !, 
  then hungarians became unbearable , so we all turned to the ** habsburgs ** , and proudly , sovereignly , bravely , bla bla , we agreed to a deal with them , * sharing * our sovereignty in return for protection and prosperity . 
  and we kinda lost everything again , but hey , we still had education , internal affairs and religion under our control !, 
  we 're still in charge of ourselves !, 
  then the habs became unbearable , so we revolted against them , shot some of them , and joined a nice mutually-respected union with the ** serbs and the slovenes ** . 
  eventually , serbia got to control our armies , trade and policy , but , hey , we still had education , internal and religion !, 
  then things got so unbearable , we fucking turned to ** hitler ** . 
  with him we struck a fab deal , got all we wanted , a nice little country , but without real power . 
  take a wild guess , what areas of govt did we keep ? 
  then that failed too , so we went back to our slavs and tried out ** socialism ** . 
  i mean , it 's literally based on all parts being equal . 
  how wrong could that be !, 
  well , at one point , we were almost content with being able to keep religion , internal and education , but then the party started messing with that too , and everyone went mad . 
  so we killed each other . 
  * again * . 
  and then we were ** free ** . 
  and we had everything to ourselves .

  how exactly will a paneurowhatever eliminate nato ? 
  i 'm pretty sure slovenia is sending its soldiers to afg because of nato , not because it ca n't find people to unite with and stop the oppressive us . 
  i do n't think ( s ) he is as worried about the top 10 wealthiest countries as ( s ) he is for the other 20 . 
  call me crazy , but i somehow think that the post-communist boom in idiots is , in a way , just . 
  i mean , there are huge flaws and corruption is raging , but at least in the balkans , the corrupt idiots sometimes win by huge margins and get actual public opinion . 
  that is what democracy is to us , and it 's `` working '' in the sense that people initially * do want * italy 's berlusconi or bosnia 's dodik in power . 
  and since everything always goes according to plan when the balkans are ignored for a while , what 's the worst that could happen , right ? 
  the people ( not the govts , mind you ) in the balkans will never , ever , ever accept this . 
  have we learned nothing ? 
  it 's really hard to tell . 
  montenegro is whichever is closest to serbia haha . 
  i actually wan na hear op 's response to this , i 've been dying to know what 's it like on the other side . 
  in croatia , we call our yugoslav war veterans ` defenders ' ( branitelji ) . 
  i think a serbian friend once told me you guys call them ` warriors ' ( ratnici ) . 
  is this true ? 
  are they praised by the government for successful ( yet condemned ) actions ? 
  i love having an opportunity to have this dialogue . 
  but it 's different than in the us , methinks . 
  here , only the veterans or their ( extended ) families seem to be actually emphatic about showing public support for veterans , while the rest seems to ignore them . 
  i could be biased , though , cause i 'm in zagreb . 
  hello ed1989 , this is the balkans calling . 
  here are the results of my best guess : 20 . 
  - slovenia ( austrian-like hat ) 21 . 
  - serbia ( the cccc emblem on the t-shirt ) 25 . 
  - macedonia 26 . 
  - albania it 's r, 
  see , this is why i 'm against euro-federalism . 
  you ca n't push for a federation if the states themselves have secessionists movements of the strength of catalonia , baskia , bayern , kosovo , etc. 
  or maybe you can , i do n't know . 
  i 'm scared , guys . 
  ... said yugoslavia , czechoslovakia , etc. 
  i somehow feel like we 're to blame for all of this . 
  who the hell would downvote this ? 
  i am very gay in croatia . 
  a huge percentage ( maybe 40 % ? ), 
  of the catholic population ( which make up 89 % of the country according to the 2011 census ) would kill me , hurt me or exile me . 
  meanwhile , neighboring slovenia is just as catholic and incredibly less homophobic . 
  not to mention , for example , spain . 
  and i do n't fear that the majority will me on the street . 
  yes , if the majority of muslim immigrants start putting pressure on western women to wear the hijab , then you have every right to invoke their tolerance . 
  but , as a minority , if they are not interfering with the civil system of the majority in any palpable way , as i believe is the case , then they have the right to have their culture if they are ok with it . 
  i 'm curious - have they succeeded in pressuring the host country into muslim norms ? 
  also , do the muslim women complain about their treatment ? 
  these are real questions , i do n't know how it is in more advanced countries . 
  even if we go by your defintion , you have exemplified `` intense dislike '' for people from `` islamic countries '' . 
  you should definitely not stand for hr violations , and islam may very well `` move one from barbaric practices '' like christianity . 
  that 's their path to take , but you can not and should not have a stance which gives them an option to either assimilate or move out .
