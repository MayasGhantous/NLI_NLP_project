  and if you account that this county in which i live ( oh look you can hear from someone who actually lives there rather than from some salty serbs ) is biggest supporter of hdz i 'm not even surprised shit like this happens . 
  they even booed our current pm and president which is from hdz was applauded the most . 
  their whole rhetoric is based on anti serbs , anti sdp ( second largest leftist party currently on power ) and the current leader of hdz was a minister of intelligence . 
  just look at parade in zagreb day before this . 
  nothing like this happened over there . 
  there are elections coming up in few months , this was a perfect way to gain political points and if these idiots get on power it will be one of saddest day for croatia . 
  as far as i know putin is considered to be richer than gates but nobody knows how much he stole . 
  all these flavors and you choose to be salty ... 
   for what do we need strong millitary even tho its currently most powerful in the region ? 
  ftfy, 
   dubrovnic fuck yea, 
  srsly whats wrong i 'm going there in a month ? 
  the soa ( our cia/fbi ) probably got them and gave it to media ( vecernji list ) so it does n't look like we actually tapped their phones . 
  did n't know that one . 
  except that most of immigrants to europe are n't from syria ... 
  at least we do n't fuck kids . 
  actually there is more croatians here but we are n't so desperate . 
  but what after hungary builds the fence ? 
  i 'm sure as hell they wont go to romania . 
  what will stop them from going to croatia and then again to hungary ? 
  how much mosques bosnia has ? 
  how much mosques croatia has ? 
  well tanks rolled from serbia to slovenia , croatia and bosnia , not the other way . 
  i think it 's clear who shouldve worked towards not conducting war . 
   defending israel , defending jews against antisemitism , support for serbs , unity of serbs and jews . 
  yep , totally not biased, 
  croatia was doing operations such as jump 1 and winter 94 on bosnian territory 4 years before nato came . 
  and nato bombing had nothing to do with bosnia . 
  nothing better than guy from sweden teaching me what happened here ... 
  why do half of serbs here choose not to put their flairs ? 
   some rotten apples . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93uwgut8euw&amp;list=flh2tjahuv7msqbvm6uwnvvq&amp;index=10 that 's few rotten apples to you ? 
  moderator of / r/serbia defending serbia on / r/europe without flair and writing comment in style  is pushing serbia and serbs away from the eu like he 's not even serbian that is in some other neutral country that nothing to with wars in balkan . 
  classic serbian on internet . 
  then western hercegovina should join croatia ? 
  see where i 'm going with this ? 
  its much complicated than you think . 
  you are n't even in europe and you 're under dunning kruger effect, 
  so you would try to forget if 8000 people from your country were killed ? 
  hypocrisy at its best ... 
  yea i 'm sure jna had problems with embargo even tough it was one of biggest armies in the world at that time and that before invasion on croatia they took all weapons which then had to be obtained trough smuggling on borders . 
  classic serbian on internet . 
   resulted in a several hundred thousands civilians abandoning their homes maybe because those [ `` civilians '' ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/balvan-revolucija#/media/file:43-1-slavon-srbi-4-1991.jpg ) never wanted to live in independent croatia , and maybe because those same people created sao krajina ( which was retaken in operation strom ) were putting road blocks and terrorizing croats that live there ? 
  not to mention fear-mongering and brainwashing after which they thought we were satans coming to decapitate them all . 
  quote from video below at 2:30 - `` croat , he wants too kill , slaughter , burn and slaughter these kids '' ** they even practiced retreating month before operation storm ** - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aazjoh_ohes, 
  the operation in lazaret is one of reasons there is little weed to find in croatia ... 
  and would you like nato to stay neutral if you get attacked ? 
  if you look at 16th picture ( mitrovica ) it has graffiti that says `` ovo je srbija '' which means this is serbia . 
  a userbase that is mostly from usa and european countries that are against russia . 
  seriously ? 
   john , an 18-year-old eritrean student , had been in the station for three days , and is hoping to get to norway , via switzerland and germany so switzerland and germany are n't safe enough ? 
  juncker says how european people say they care about refugees but that they do n't support immigration quotas ... ignoring that most of those people would choose sending immigrants back after rescuing them . 
  and i like how he acts like there is only 2 options 1 . 
  let them drown 2 . 
  accept them and distribute to every country equally but rescuing and then sending them back ? 
  nooooooooo that 's insane !, 
  how much time are we going to see this same comment repeat on this sub ? 
  why is patriot criticized so much ? 
  well we are nation with lots of smokers , alcoholic and obese people ... 
  only thing that hurts me is that usa did n't get involved 8 years earlier . 
  how many lost lives and suffering would n't happen ... 
   it 's natural that an army of a country tries to move in to supress ~ ~ a ~ ~ 5 revolts ftfy, 
  [ wait for us !, 
  his comments always got lots of upvotes here ... 
  meanwhile he deleted this response to me few months ago http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2umhmu/uns_highest_court_says_serbia_did_not_commit/coa49ku?context=3 i do n't know why i got downvoted here since croatia is n't the one who invaded 5 other countries in a decade ... not only his comment is deleted but comments from 2 users below him too ? 
  one of comments is  it 's true , i was on the hill when / u/majkaa [ 1 ] tried to run me over with his tank . 
  / s / u/majkaa account has been deleted and other account also deleted his comment so is it possible he had multiple accounts and did vote manipulation by upvoting his own comments ? 
  [ pipl mast trast as !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5orzjnkviq4 ), 
  the fuck, 
   almost 60 % of those with hiv in russia are injecting drug users and a further group are the sexual partners of the drug users, 
  it would be better for them to die at sea than end here in croatia and try to survive ... 
  lololol but we have americans to protect our asses amirite ? 
  i think we should stop calling this all thing immigration to europe and start calling it immigration to : italy , france , uk , sweden or germany . 
  you know that one that started a whole war ? 
  just because half of country is in favor it does n't make it right decision . 
  why are patriots always so criticized ? 
  wow what is the name of that one ? 
  and europe is twice the size of us ... 
  remember when all phones had different chargers ? 
   the kek is top fuck off to 4chan please ... 
   the nato bombing is a major reason for the currently dismal economy in serbia , many major industries were bankrupted by the collapsed infrastructure . 
  should have thought better before attacking couple of your neighbors, 
   most european countries are unwilling to go to war to defend an attacked nato ally . 
  that pool is asking people , not the government . 
  the 44 % of americans who do n't want or do n't know is n't really low number either . 
  also who gives a fuck about what people think ? 
  after all , largest anti-war protest in history of mankind was against iraq war and politicians did n't give a fuck - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/february_15,_2003,_anti-war_protests#united_states, 
   i still do not believe in criminalizing the speech though . 
  what kind of speech ? 
  calling for violence is hate speech , not free speech . 
  just like some imam calling for jihad in europe . 
   i also do not support the state targeting them for their speech . 
  i would n't support state either , but i know what kind of content and discussion happens in these kind of facebook groups . 
   men between 22 and 58 , are alleged to have posted anti-migrant messages , anti-semitic messages and songs with banned lyrics , among other things . 
  they face possible fines if found guilty . 
  so yeah , there is difference between free speech and hate speech . 
  what did jews did to them anyways ? 
  cause you have n't seen what fucking idiots are usually in these facebook groups . 
  it 's like as if it attracts most retarded people ever .
