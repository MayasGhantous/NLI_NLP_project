  i 'm sorry , were the concentration camps april fools joke ? 
  or there are no gays in russia ? 
  what do you think about the slaves ? 
  same thing happened in 1991 when iraq invaded kuwait ( important thing to note is that usa and west was on saddam side all the way until invasion ) . 
  then the americans told iraqis that they have `` no opinion '' on arab conflicts which probably led iraqis to believe they wo n't do anything , but instead they did a complete 180 . 
  so i 'm guessing here we have similar situation . 
  ok , lets put it this way , where is the evidence of russia narrative that it hit chemical storage ? 
  only the west needs to provide evidence ? 
   pardon my confusion , but is n't the only thing `` known '' where the planes went from ? 
  which is assad 's base . 
  yes , they have radar data for that  but it is n't proven where the chemical bit came from ? 
  us stated that they have intelligence of people involved in syria chemical warfare program have been present on airfield the day attack was done  for all i know it might have happened that the rebels had a stockpile on the ground chemical weapons are usually stored binary , so theory that it exploded and mixed perfectly in air are bs , not to mention the guardian reporter was in that warehouse and did n't find anything , and most importantly the impact craters were in middle of street without any deep damage to asphalt , not really something indicative of guided bombs with hundreds kgs of explosive in them . 
   ( are n't they known for using chemicals , anyways ? 
  ) , no they are n't , there has n't been one proven instance of rebels using chemical weapons isis is known to use chemicals , but this is n't nowhere near them and they used cholrine and sulfur mustard , never sarin . 
  not to mention syrians and russians literally contradicting themselves on rusian media , with russians saying it there was bombing by syrians planes at around 12:00 ( it was at around 07:00 ) and then syrians saying there was no bombing at all ? 
   we need to work with russia and assad to bring about a sensible end to this ... 
  sorry , not really fan of someone who usese sarin on kids, 
  you have concentration camps for gays in your country and your government called use of sarin on children as a `` prank '' . 
  west makes mistakes but russia has absolutely 0 credibility . 
  so how do we get fn voters out of france ? 
  would be nice if right wingers dont support dictators who use sarin on women and children, 
  no worries , those nationalists are still on jews . 
  why are norway and switzerland in single market then ? 
   why ca n't pro-federal eu people have an adult , serious , debate and address the serious criticisms being made ? 
  generalises bunch of people how they ca n't have serious conversation then posts someone elses opinion , topkeks, 
  totally not a strawman, 
  it 's that simple, 
  no , but it does explain why hitler loved islam and muslims, 
  did we talk about christianity when breivik happened ? 
  that 's why i said encrypted, 
  could n't you just encrypt your important stuff and upload it somewhere on cloud and when you 're in us just download it and unlock it ? 
   i hear from people dismissing the threat of terrorism as not important someone always says this about `` them '' although i never saw anyone who actually says this, 
   in numbers , there are around 4,2 million people living in croatia right now actually , the number is now thought to be less than 4 million, 
   classic / r/europe does this have to happen in every thread ? 
   state , anyone who opposes the one party state is made to feel unwelcome here and gets thrown out or leaves compared to other subreddits what happens here is nothing lol , you straight up get banned immediately on others, 
  that is so pathetic jeez, 
  perfect, 
  we can if we coordinate between all european subs , they already showed they are the strongest . 
  i 'm pretty sure that without merkel 's invitation in 2015 brexit would n't happen . 
  not for platooning, 
  someone is going to take a shit on them i guarantee you . 
  oh no , its retarded, 
   according to a study by the soufan group published in december 2015 -- one of the highest ratio of foreign fighters per population number in europe . 
  interesting , since according to this source - http://www.rferl.org/a/foreign-fighters-syria-iraq-is-isis-isil-infographic/26584940.html kosovo : 100-150 france : up to 1600 germany : 600 belgium :520 netherlands : 200-250 and those are from countries with islam as huge minority and statistics get skewed because of large non-muslim majority while in kosovo muslims are overwhelming majority (  95 % ) so if you take into account amount of fighters per muslims western european countries are having much bigger problem . 
  and anecdotally , did you hear of any terrorist attacks in kosovo during last few years ? 
  let alone the fact that they one of most pro-usa countries in the entire world another great success of nato countries . 
   remind me again what good came out of bombing serbia yeah , who cares about fucking 4 other countries that serbia invaded , poor serbia is the victim !, 
  it 's always paris and sweden , none of other countries , interesting ... 
  welcome to croatia !, 
   how else is the car going to know how conditions on the road are ? 
  uhh how is that thing on internet know the conditions on road ? 
  i heard that chinese and serbian spies were hiding in there trying to trade f-117 parts so americans did that `` accidentally '', 
   but i would n't trust a device connected to the internet with my life . 
  what does this have to do with autonomous vehicles ? 
   people that say `` it 's cheaper that way '' cool , lets see the math  it 's a ridiculous idea . 
  are you purposefully being retarded ? 
  this is how i imagine a 12 year old would look on this . 
  =  actually lose money because you paid $ 10k to smugglers and die, 
  americans ? 
  some annexation tips too, 
   you just have to see in 20 years . 
  top fucking kek , in your dreams maybe, 
  here 's one for croatia 2001-2017 : 0, 
  i mean i really do n't understand how ? 
  this would help people calm the fuck down and stop some of them from acting irrationally , and currently it is very on-topic . 
  you know what 's even more hilarious ? 
  http://usa.liveuamap.com/ look at the gun shootings just today , and by the way no matter which part of year you visit that map , every single day that map is gon na be filled with new shootings all over the country , but some people just wan na do mental gymnastics and * feel * better than everyone else . 
  so you 're telling me borders are so secure that they have to pick them 20km from libya coast ? 
   which is supposedly a border protection agency they are n't trying to stop them as of now, 
  usa also has like 10 times more illegals than europe all while trying to to stop them , while we did n't even try to stop them for some time and now that we did close balkan route it dropped 99 % ( but our borders are weak ? - weak borders paradox huh ? 
  ) , also something i 've never seen mentioned is fact that you ca n't get on a plane to eu without a visa , meaning you ca n't come and overstay like 40 % of mexicans do in us , so we in a way have even stronger border policy , so when someone says how bad are we compared to us i do n't know what the fuck they 're talking about . 
   they 're all completely exposed to enemy fire while operating the gun do n't think there 's much fire 30 km behind frontlines  and they need over a minute to leave their position after firing the last shell . 
  that 's insanely fast, 
  refugees can be rich too, 
  so where do we stop then ? 
  considering there are billions of poor people , they all just come here ? 
   nope , everyone who has signed the un refugee declaration also has an obligation to accept refugees . 
  is a poor guy from somalia refugee ? 
  there was n't any war on germany borders either when they took refugees from balkans . 
   muslims  ethnicly cleansed so which is it ? 
  you could say the same thing about balkans in 90s, 
  based on what ? 
  yeah , i wanted to write it 's not a thing anywhere in europe , then remembered sweden, 
   first of all , pc culture is n't even a thing in mainstream dutch politics . 
  not thing in 90 % of europe . 
  she is n't even going to win first round anymore, 
  83 % ... stop being a fucking hypocrite please , you probably want eu to disintegrate while saying shit like this, 
  nice ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  refugees from syria stopping are n't gon na stop others from middle east and africa . 
  10 years ago there was n't one wind turbine around me , now there 's 5-6 mountains/hills that have 8-20 wind turbines on them . 
  and what about the british one ? 
  pretty accurate ? 
  wait , he 's been suspended for speaking his mind ? 
  is this what the uk parliament has become ? 
  and if priests didnt rape kids ... 
  you 're acting just like turks now, 
  not since terrorist attacks , their tourism got cut by half while there is increase in southern european countries . 
  erdogan really managed to fuck up turkey . 
  few days ago a ** white ** ** christian ** ** mentally ill ** 19-year old in germany killed a kid and a woman , and hanged kids guts around the room . 
  which one of these bolded words do you think are important ?
