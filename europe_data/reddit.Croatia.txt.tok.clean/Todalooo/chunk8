  of course they should , i remember reading these same articles 5 years ago , why they still have n't done it i have no clue . 
  most european countries that are n't paying enough are so small that even if they hit 2 % it would n't make much of a difference , stop pretending that hitting 2 % will solve everything . 
   than why did you basically tell us to suck a dick everytime obama told you to increase military spending & take care of your own backyard ? 
  do n't pretend like you 're some politician that had any effect on what happened , you 're just couple neckbeards arguing on internet . 
  is it 2024 ? 
   maybe you could stop calling them `` far-right '' then ? 
  none of these parties are talking about `` race '' ### oh wait you 're full of shit afd member of the parliament : `` we should throw gays into prison too like they do in muslim countries ! '',

   you are not my friend by any reasonable definition of the word / r/totallynotrobots, 
  or maybe , i dunno the left does n't give a fuck about what religion someone believes in and that believing in islam does n't make you a subhuman ? 
  crazy concept i know . 
  - how a 11 year old would think, 
   i 'm not convinced the eu ( vs the ec ) has anything to do with it . 
  lol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/european_coal_and_steel_community  the ecsc was first proposed by french foreign minister robert schuman on 9 may 1950 as a way to prevent further war between france and germany . 
  he declared his aim was to `` make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible '' [ 3 ] which was to be achieved by regional integration , of which the ecsc was the first step . 
  the treaty would create a common market for coal and steel among its member states which served to neutralise competition between european nations over natural resources , particularly in the ruhr . 
   thinking he can tell the russian people how the realities are , being in sweden . 
   luckily i live in russia in not in your capital of rape .

   the american college of pediatricians ( acpeds ) is a ** socially conservative advocacy group ** of pediatricians and other healthcare professionals in the united states . 
  [ 1 ] the group was founded in 2002 by a group of pediatricians , including joseph zanga , a past president of the american academy of pediatrics ( aap ) , as a ** protest against the aap 's support for adoption by gay couples . 
  ** [ 2 ] [ 3 ] ** the group 's membership as of 2016 is estimated at 500 members , [ 4 ] [ 5 ] in contrast to the aap 's over 60,000 members . 
  ** [ 6 ]  founder joseph zanga has described it as a group ** `` with judeo-christian , traditional values that is open to pediatric medical professionals of all religions '' provided that they `` hold true to the group 's core beliefs : that life begins at conception ; and that the traditional family unit , headed by an opposite-sex couple , poses far fewer risk factors in the adoption and raising of children . 
  '' [ 8 ] **  the organization 's view on parenting is at odds with the position of the american academy of pediatrics , which holds that ** sexual orientation has no correlation with the ability to be a good parent and to raise healthy and well-adjusted children . 
  ** [ 5 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] the ** american college of pediatricians ** has been described by the southern poverty law center as a `` hate group '' , with `` a history of propagating damaging falsehoods about lgbt people  some scientists have voiced concerns that acpeds mischaracterized or misused their work to advance its political agenda . 
  [ 2 ] [ 16 ] gary remafedi , a pediatrician at the university of minnesota , wrote acpeds a public letter accusing them of fundamentally mischaracterizing his research in their publications to argue that schools should deny support to gay teenagers also said hpv vaccine causes cancer : http://www.snopes.com/pediatricians-association-admits-hpv-vaccine-cancer-link/ excellent source you got there . 
  wouldnt that be like reminding ourselves ? 
  you 're god damn right . 
  if you went into tourist heavy areas which are on coast you wont even see a muslim . 
  dude , theres like 3 muslims in croatia, 
  switzerland must be such a shithole then . 
  just like that church on fire from few days ago on breitbart . 
  you also have to pay smugglers couple k so i dont think they profit off of thid, 
  then why for example you ca n't join us army with adhd but you can if you 're transgender ? 
  would n't most powerfully army have in it 's interest to have mentally healthy people in it ? 
  science is not on your side, 
  what does this have to do with dogs ? 
  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-truth-about-transgend_b_8564834.html you 're assumed correctly , there is n't a high rate of suicide because they 're transgender , it is because people push them to do that . 
  half of them will attempt suicide . 
  you really think it can get fucking worse than that ? 
  is there a gene that makes gay 's bad parents ? 
   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brynn-tannehill/the-truth-about-transgend_b_8564834.html  the statistic that 40 % of transgender people have attempted suicide is used all the time to justify all sorts of things that have absolutely zero basis in science . 
   another study ** showed that transgender youth whose parents reject their gender identity are 13 times more likely to attempt suicide than transgender youth who are supported by their parents **, 
   that this happens in europe , in civilizied world ? 
  yeah , also why are gays so accepted in `` civilised '' europe ? 
  we should follow isis model and use those roofs ,  he dont understand it , kid seemed to be more mature and speak better english than 90 % of redditors  its wrong on so many levels yup , isis throws them off the roofs , why ca n't we do the same ? 
  agreed , back in my day they would beat transgender out of you with belt , worked perfectly fine . 
  is n't like the most deadly attack in germany in last few years actually done by alt-righter neo-nazi that killed 18ppl and said breivik is cool ? 
   pict456 in altright kek, 
   and you think it 'll get any better for germany ? 
  germany is far from turkey right now , do n't try to make it appear like its even slightly similar or that germany is some kind of warzone , turkey has had attacks that killed hundred of people in just one attack . 
  holy shit lets become fucking irrational and destroy ourselves what the fuck reeeeeeeee, 
  still , turkey seems to be having bombing every week , it already hurt their tourism last season , and i do n't think next one is going to be better . 
  wake up man !, 
  there is still time !, 
   google : `` building 7 '' . 
  you 'll see how much media fools you . 
  ah yes , the good ol' building 7 , the thing that you conspiracy theorist believers do n't know is that even your other fellow conspiracy friends are lying to you !, 
  how you 're wondering ? 
  the main argument is that its impossible for building to free fall like that without using any explosives here 's a video of that !, 
  https://youtu.be/zv7bimvveyk?t=78 which is true !, 
  because the building did not free fall at all !, 
  why do people think it did ? 
  well the conspiracy theorists actually cut out the first part of the video which shows the collapsing started many seconds before !, 
  https://youtu.be/pk_ibysqesc?t=15 that 's right , millions of people are probably believing in this shit just like you because your fellow conspiracy friends decided to manipulate you !, 
  you 've all been bamboozled !, 
  how does it feel ? 
  his username checks out lol, 
   western main media rarely writes anything that can be seen as pro-russian it 's weird how western media does n't write anything good about country that is actively trying to dismantle west , annexes part of another country and shoots down 300 people , so much bias !, 
  so a polished turd ? 
   guys use this kind of talk everyday guys that are n't going to lead most powerful nation in the world  it was rude i would call rude someone who does n't return back `` hi '' for example , saying that you can do anything to women when you 're rich and disrespecting them when you 're a 60 year old man is not the same , it 's certainly insight in mind of this man . 
   but not this dirty tricks used to discredit somebody . 
  you mean like calling someone muslim kenyan even after being proven wrong ? 
   no doubt i doubt that . 
  i also doubt he will be good for america , but part of me is glad he won , i just wan na see how much shit can get fucked up . 
   and i say that as someone who 's gay and indian . 
  ohhh you 're one of those `` i 'm gay black mexican that supports trump ''  i think this represents one of the major reasons why the left-wing is collapsing in europe . 
  you do realize that merkel 's party , the one who is responsible for this huge wave of immigration is right wing ? 
   i wish more people would wake up and realize that the left-wing is n't the bastion of progressiveness that the us yes , the people who call entire nation rapists and want to disband eu while also supporting russia who wants the same thing ( useful idiots ??? ), 
  are sooooo progressive . 
  but he was in porno and said he could grab 'em by the pussy . 
  i do n't think anyone claimed to be raped by him only touched inappropriately or something like that . 
   20 years later . 
   no evidence whatsoever . 
  bill cosby is innocent then . 
  have you been living under rock ? 
  there is n't a problem with stopping people crossing illegally over borders , we could do that without any problem . 
  you 're saying `` european countries countries are * letting * them without any obstacles and that 's why their border control sucks ! '', 
  that makes no sense if we are n't even trying to stop them . 
  my country has network of radars , sensors and long range cameras on islands that can detect even small boats and automatically point cameras at them and we 're not even in schengen , so saying that there is a problem with border security is bullshit .
