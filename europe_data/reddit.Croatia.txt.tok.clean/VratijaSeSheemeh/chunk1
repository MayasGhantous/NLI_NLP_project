or maybe ... just maybe ... your comments were bad . 
  no , you were n't . 
  you meant what you wrote , and you wrote in terms of political entities - countries , not peoples . 
  because , you know - that 's what the words you have written * mean * , and there is no way you could interpret what you said as anything but what it actually and unambiguously means . 
  and what do i need to `` trust you '' about ? 
  that you 're right ? 
  well why do n't you go ahead and prove those claims you made :  rs never tried to seceed they wanted all of bosnia . 
  how do you know that ? 
  do you have some intimate knowledge of bosnian serbs ' leaders intentions that proves this ? 
  if so , produce the evidence , please . 
  i have read mladi\u0107 's diaries in its entirety , and nowhere does he mention the plan of conquering 100 % of bosnia 's territory . 
  in fact , you can sense his disagreement with karad\u017ei\u0107 about karad\u017ei\u0107 's pursue for 70 + % of `` historically serbian land '' , when mladi\u0107 actually wanted less territory in order to defend it more adequately . 
  just google `` ratko mladic war diaries '' and read for yourself , i 'm not making up any of this . 
   even when you go back to 92 ' you hear bosnian troops saying that they want bosniaks and serbs to live side by side ... and that proves ... what exactly ? 
  there are also bosnian troops shouting `` allahu ackbar '' and there are pictures of bosnian fighters doing stuff like [ ** nsfw ** ] [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5jiea7d.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/sa6mdyg.jpg ) and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rxrq1do.jpg ) ; does that make them all religious fanatics and jihadists and terrorists ? 
  the answer is : no . 
  you ca n't just take one instance of something and say that 's how everything is like . 
  you have to take into account a representative sample of bosnian fighters , interview them about whatever you want and then make a conclusion - your anecdotal evidence means nothing . 
  you can only make generalizations about whatever you want it to mean ( like i demonstrated with those pictures of severed heads of serbian civilians ) but that pretty much worthless . 
  *** for future reference :  serbia = the country in the balkans  serbs = people living mostly and serbia and bosnia and herzegovina  serbian = relating to either the country of serbia or serbian people, 
   i was talking about bosnian serbs when i said invaders [ no , you were n't . 
   serbia genocide denier serb apologist detected . 
  til serbs are the main culprits for the ukraine crisis . 
  thank you , bosnia , for opening my eyes . 
  i 'll give it to you :3, 
   you 're the one ** claiming ** that there is a distinction . 
  you keep using that word , i do n't think it means what you think it means . 
   if i say that was not the case , you 're supposed to prove me wrong , not the other way around . 
  again , sorry , no . 
  if i present that as my opinion ( and that 's what an assumption basically is ) , you are welcome to change it by using legitimate sources ( like you did with that report , which is certainly a step towards a sane , rational discussion on your behalf ) which indicate otherwise . 
  if i present it as an argument , i am obliged to provide extensive and strong evidence in favor of it . 
  that 's how it goes . 
  this report seems to confirm your claims that to ( at least muslim ) albanians , religion plays little role in their day-to-day lives , but still does n't tell us anything of the nature of catholic < -  muslim albanians or catholic albanians < -  serbs interactions * during * the war . 
  it 's findings may apply to peaceful conditions ( which is on what it mainly focuses , with blatant downplaying of destruction of religious objects and reducing it to mere `` vandalism '' ) but may not hold on to the political climate during wartime . 
  ** edit : ** since you really do n't want to listen to what i 'm trying to convey and/or do n't actually understand what i 'm saying , i will reply no more . 
  i will just address this :  the bottom line is you 're suggesting there is some kind of inter-religious conflict , and you 're not providing any evidence that there is such a thing . 
  nope . 
  again , strawman . 
  i was merely presenting an option that religious differences between albanians might have also influenced different political affiliations between those groups and the serbs . 
  there is no point in continuing this since you have made several feeble attempts to discredit and twist what i was saying and it has crossed my threshold level of tolerance . 
  i can understand patriotism , religious devotion , and even fanboyism , but once it starts being disrespectful , i 'm out . 
  peace . 
   you seem to think there 's a distinction between albanian catholics and albanian muslims you finally got it . 
   i said it before but they 're the same thing , you wo n't find anything talking about albanian catholics differing opinions on the serb government compared to albanian muslims because they believed the same thing in general . 
  religion is not an important aspect of day-to-day albanian lives , it 's largely irrelevant . 
  [ citation needed ] abscence of evidence is not evidence of abscence . 
   where do i find sources of something not happening ? 
  because that 's what you 're telling me to do . 
  you 're assuming there 's a distinction to be made between albanian catholics & muslims , ** and then telling me to find evidence that there is . 
  ** because you 're the one making claims here . 
  some helpful sources might include : * a book on kosovo albanian culture and religion * a substantiated and fact-based report on religious structure of kla compared to religious structure of kosovo albanians * a report on demographic changes after the kosovo conflict ** edit : ** editing your post makes it hard to write a follow-up answer . 
  please refrain from doing so . 
  and announce your edits unless it 's a trivial spelling or grammar error . 
   no one else assumes this , maybe it 's because religion is more important to serbs in general ? 
  well you 're not arguing with anyone else here but me , right ? 
   maybe you should also tell me to find evidence of albanians that were loyal to the serb government based on which ones like dark chocolate and which do n't , because that 's how relevant this argument about religion is to albanians . 
  the only thing irrelevant here is your example . 
  inter-religious conflict is a well observed occurance even between members of the same nation , while the chocolate preference in the same context is ... just absurd . 
  i implied you were accusing me of that . 
   ... when you do n't have any knowledge of them apart from a biased documentary . 
  also :  i was trying to defuse the argument ...  you ca n't provide me any proof of catholic albanians sided with the serb government . 
  i never said that . 
  read my original post and try again , this time without resorting to strawman . 
  but here , just for shit and giggles , i 'll quote myself :  well , they were ** more loyal to the serbian government ** , maybe they were targeted by muslim albanians ? 
  besides , was n't the mainstream narrative `` genocidal serbs vs. poor muslims '' ? 
  i hope you successfully deducted that * more loyal * meant * ... compared to muslim albanians * . 
  one post down :  i got that ** assumption ** from a miroslav lazanski film where he showed multiple catholic albanian villagers greeting ypa like they were their saviors . 
  while ** that documentary was plainly biased ** , i believe it 's pretty safe to apply occam 's razor here preemptively and disregard any conspiracy theories about `` serbia paid actors '' or something like that . 
  i ca n't seem to find where i mentioned * catholic albanians siding with the serbs * , correct me if i 'm wrong and such thing exists . 
  i deliberately neglected to ** claim ** anything because all i had was [ ** anecdotal evidence ** ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcnobksr7xq ) . 
  you , on the other hand , seem to have no problem whatsoever with making bold statements without ** any ** sources while blatantly generalizing , disregarding everything i said , and finally twisting my position and implying `` u rong u haev no evurdenc '' . 
   you 're the one that has to convince me of your narrative that was never my intention . 
  besides , it seems that you already have one , and it seems it 's rather strongly rooted in emotions . 
  i would n't want to rob you off your feelings . 
   why is the burden of proof on me when you 're the one claiming catholic albanians sided with the serb government ? 
  give_me_proof_for_things_that_never_happened_nor_what_you_said . txt, 
  no , you are just giving up because you failed to convince me to your narrative while also failing to provide sources for your claims and finally resorting to argumentum ad ignorantiam ... 
  okay then . 
  if you want to leave it at ` opinion vs opinion ' , then delete the last part and i 'll delete mine . 
   i 'm saying from the opinions the serb soldiers had about albanians which neither you or i could claim to know for certain . 
  it is not entirely impossible that at least some serb soldiers were acting professionally , for if that was n't the case , and every single one of them was evil and bloodthirsty , the final death toll would certainly be six digit . 
   makes it highly unlikely that any albanian , catholic or muslim , had any sympathy towards them unlikely , maybe , but not impossible . 
  checkout [ this guy ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ismet_%c4%90uheri%c4%87 ) , he was on the serb side during the bosnian war . 
  hard to imagine someone fighting alongside someone who allegedly wants to obliterate you , eh ? 
  it 's almost as if human conflict is n't entirely black and white . 
   you do n't need to like the kla to be against serb paramilitary burning your house down . 
  it goes both ways . 
  if you liked and supported kla , it was more likely that you 'd get your house burned down ( which is imo far more reasonable explanation than ` evil surbs doing evul dings because deyur evul ' - and i can pretty safely assume that to be correct because i grew up in a multi-religious municipality in bosnia where each of the three nations had their own local territorial defenses and cooperated together in a plethora of ways - from ammunition and food distribution to holding their neighbor 's positions so that they can go home for a few days for religious festivities ; i 'm particularly proud that our community had no major incidents despite its territory having all sorts of differences ) . 
  your error seems to be hiding in completely disregarding the political dimension of the conflict , and that loyalty of local population more often than you 'd like to admit was also determined by intra-national political differences rather than exclusively by inter-national , black and white , good vs evil narrative-counternarrative exchange of that time . 
  well , in croatia and bosnia for example , there were instances of whole units of one nationality fighting in the army where the majority was their supposed ` enemies ' against ` their own people ' . 
  i do n't see why kosovo should be a special case in that regard , and i 'm seriously hoping you do n't just assume that each and every albanian supported kla ( again , a clear evidence from an unbiased source would be enough for me to change my mind , but until then , i remain skeptical towards that whole story and will only assume things from the limited information i have at my disposal ) . 
   well i think you showed a lot of your ignorance by referring to albanians as `` alluhuakbaring '' . 
  if you failed to detect my subtle hint of irony in that comment , i wholeheartedly suggest you to spend some more time on the internets . 
  but just so that you do n't further embarrass yourself , i 'm going to explain to you how was that supposed to have gone : * kla at one point being classified by usa , un , uk and france as a terrorist organization ( please check the sources at the [ wiki ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kosovo_liberation_army#status_as_terrorist_group ) page before attempting to disprove it ) ... and being that about 90 % of kosovo albanians are muslims and ... * terrorism is almost universally recognized as radical islam terrorism ( this one 's a generalization , but note that i 'm not claiming exclusiveness in the terrorism < -  islam link , just that almost the whole world generalizes thusly ) * radical islam warriors , or mujaheddins ' battle-cry is `` allahu akbar '' which i believe translates to `` god is great '' ( correct me if i 'm wrong )  i 'm not sure how you can make flippant statements you seem to fail to understand the difference between an assumption and a statement . 
  i never claimed that was the case , it was just my ... assumption . 
  i do not know enough facts about the sentiment of different religious groups towards the yugoslav government at that time , it 's just that i had the impression that catholic albanians were rather reluctant to join kla and supported the other side . 
  if you would n't mind , i 'd like to know the other side of the story , so if you know any legitimate sources showing the composition of the kla and the sentiment of the different religious groups about the kosovo case , i 'd be really thankful if you showed them to me , or i 'll be destined to know only half of the story which seems to be in favor of my original views . 
  conditioning people like that , `` remove milosevic from premises or we bomb u moar '' could work in theory , but airstrikes went on for two and a half months , and it was only a year later , after he tried to steal elections that he was removed . 
  not to mention that it did little to undermine war war crimes - they still went on wherever there were fightings between ypa and kla . 
  nato aggression , like ypa aggression in croatia and bosnia , and in kosova also , for that matter , only strengthened national cohesion , for in each of those instances , people seemed to view ( and rightly so ) that aggression as directed to the nation/people itself , instead as an attack on the people in charge .
