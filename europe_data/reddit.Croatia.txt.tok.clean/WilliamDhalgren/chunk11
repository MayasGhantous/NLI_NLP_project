  not too related to our flag though - they prefer a somewhat different coat of arms , and the colors were the same under communism too . 
  i 'm not at all familiar with the context in belarus and how much identification that flag has with nazism specifically - public data simply supports a decent argument that this is n't the case . 
  but you could be right - i just think you argued poorly , esp when not answering to counterpoints the poster using that same flag as his flair was giving , and given the gravity of the charge . 
  that 's no way to contribute to the discussion . 
  but this comment at least seems constructive and imho does n't deserve the votes . 
  re the actual neonazi demographic , it is an issue the entire continent needs to constantly guard against . 
  dude i think you lost the substance of the argument , how can you continue to insist on the position nevertheless ? 
   former flag in use in 1918 , unofficially in west belarus until 1939 , between 1942 and 1944 ( during german occupation ) and between 19 sep 1991 and 05 jun 1995 . right so in other words , whenever belarus had independence in modern times it used that flag . 
  so nazi collaborators used it too . 
  just like a gazillion other flags , that do n't seem controversial at all , and precisely for that reason . 
  interesting how russian enemies are invariably nazi-linked in russian influenced media ... you do n't even seem to acknowledge you do n't have a foot to stand on even though he just called out you on grounds of hypocrisy - using a flag yourself that was itself a collaborator 's flag ? 
  another example : vishy french flag : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vichy_france#mediaviewer/file:flag_of_france.svg current french flag : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/french_fourth_republic#mediaviewer/file:flag_of_france.svg hint - exactly the same . 
  parallel with swastika is hardly a particularly strong counterexample , prob because its generic associations have no tradition outside asia , and nazism made it a fixture . 
  you should n't be able to put conditions on the matter - if they seek independence , they seek sovereignty - this has a clear meaning in international law and allows them to enter nato or not , to enter the eu or not , and to vote on the structure of eu freely . 
  if they accepted conditions of that kind in exchange for their independence , that is not independence at all . 
  they can , freely and independently of having their sovereignty , confer authority over any matter including these mentioned to an international authority however . 
  and will do so if they join/remain in the eu in a fair number of areas , just as intimate to the sovereignty of a country . 
  there is further no such thing as channeling foreign policy of the eu member states - they 're not cats one needs to herd to a goal someone else sets - rather they are equal negotiators drafting a common document , over which all have a veto . 
  now as to the outcomes we hope for and seek , like majority voting in foreign policy in the eu and a common defense ( which i see as essential , nato fairly optional and subject to political whims of the electorate ) - i 'd fully support them , but the procedure for getting them is clear . 
  luckily not a treaty revision , but just a unanimous vote in the european council , or a coalition of the willing unanimous to do so . 
  if the pressures - ie difficulty and weakness of unanimity combined with the need for more effective action to protect their own interests - continue to pile up , such a vote might even happen . 
  probably not as long as the uk is a member , and other countries continue to be keen on keeping it as integrated as possible . 
  especially on foreign policy and defense . 
  if they 're definitely out , which certainly seems more likely than the much better possibility of having them truly in , then things might move i think . 
  as long as they 're one foot here one foot there , fuck it . 
   as icing on the cake sweden makes extensive use of district heating , so the facility will be able to sell the heated cooling water to the local energy companies , thus providing hot-water for many swedish homes . 
  swedes do think of everything , that 's a great touch to the story !, 
  thx everyone for the extra info , very interesting . 
  great to catch this news , thx for the report , but the article could be more informative . 
  lots on financing it and management , very little on the scientific purpose . 
  basically all i got was that it had something to do with materials science , and that comes from a quote in the text , rather than being explained . 
  an opinion piece in a newspaper ? 
  i linked icty rulings on the matter . 
  with conclusions like :  the trial chamber found that following the commencement of the nato bombing on 24 march 1999 , a ** campaign of violence was launched against the kosovo albanian civilian population ** , during which numerous kosovo albanians were ** forcibly displaced ** , incidents of ** killing and sexual assault ** took place , and ** mosques were intentionally destroyed ** . 
  the trial chamber held that neither the nato bombing , nor the ongoing armed conflict between the kosovo liberation army , or `` kla '' , and the forces of the federal republic of yugoslavia , or `` fry '' , and serbia were the primary cause of the flight of the hundreds of thousands of kosovo albanians . 
  rather , the trial chamber held that it was the ** deliberate actions ** of the forces of the fry and serbia during the campaign of violence that ** caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians ** from kosovo . 
  the trial chamber further found that `` during the time of the crimes alleged in the indictment '' a ** joint criminal enterprise ** , or `` jce '' existed , the common purpose of which was ** to forcibly displace the kosovo albanian population ** both within and without kosovo through a widespread and ** systematic campaign of terror and violence ** . 
  the trial chamber found that this was ** to ensure continued control ** by the authorities of fry and serbia over kosovo . 
  the trial chamber also concluded that while the crimes of deportation and forcible transfer were within the ambit of the common purpose , the crimes of murder , as a violation of the laws or customs of war , and murder and persecution , through murder , sexual assault , and destruction of or damage to religious property , as ** crimes against humanity ** , fell outside the common purpose of the jce . 
  so results being : milan milutinovi\u0107 , former president of the republic of serbia and yugoslav foreign minister , acquitted . 
  nikola \u0160ainovi\u0107 , yugoslav deputy prime minister , guilty on all counts , sentenced to 22 years in prison . 
  dragoljub ojdani\u0107 , chief of general staff of the vj , guilty to two counts , sentenced to 15 years in prison . 
  neboj\u0161a pavkovi\u0107 , commander of third army , guilty on all counts , sentenced to 22 years in prison . 
  vladimir lazarevi\u0107 , commander of the pristina corps vj , guilty of two counts , sentenced to 15 years in prison . 
  sreten luki\u0107 , chief of staff of the serbian police , guilty on all counts , sentenced to 22 years in prison . 
  vlastimir \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 , chief of the public security department of serbia 's ministry of internal affairs , guilty of five counts , including crimes against humanity and war crimes , and sentenced to 27 years in prison . 
  and that 's just what was solid enough to stand up in court . 
  clearly this abomination had to be stopped . 
  i 'll take my substantive rights over use of a word for it if i have to choose between the two  just hope the institution will survive changes in government . 
  legitimacy is a matter of perception . 
  i do n't think either comparisons are particularly valid . 
  iraq and kosovo , since there was no ongoing humanitarian crisis that required a quick end in the former case . 
  the notion of a humanitarian intervention despite un deadlock , legitimating violation of sovereignty is fairly old . 
  in recent use , no-fly zone in iraq was setup under that same notion , despite lacking un authorization and explicit calls by the un of it as being illegal . 
  this , operation provide comfort and not kosovo was the recent precedent actually . 
  scotland , catalonia , basque and possibly crimea - apart from the procedure not followed - are somewhat like kosovo but quite different from say lughans , donetsk , transnistria , n ossetia , abkhazia , or say n cyprus - and the latter all quite clearly illegal under international law , due to foreign involvement/irridentist character , and unlike a true domicile secessionist movement as in kosovo and the rest , which are neither obliging nor prohibited , but a political struggle . 
  and if you look at the dates on these places , you 'll see this certainly did n't start with kosovo . 
  icj did give an opinion - that no laws are broken by unilateral declarations of independence as such . 
  which is as i said , to be expected , otherwise the dutch better submit to spanish rule again etc. 
  still seems we agree on the important parts - perhaps its too knee-jerk , but this is what talk of reunification and secession reminds me of , namely how that ended up last time we had territorial aspirations outside our borders . 
  re tudjman :  it seems you think there was a better person or group to lead the croats during the break-up . 
  well , prob - i 'd go with any of them , say w racan or budisa - but that 's difficult to know in retrospective . 
   and that he is on the same level as slobodan milosevic . 
  ah , no - i 'd never go that far . 
  obviously there was quite an asymmetry of crime and blame in the yugoslav wars , just look at the distribution of war crimes verdicts if nothing else . 
  not sure what sounded disrespectful ; nevertheless their state was never croatia - surely this is uncontroversial ? 
  any political aspirations croatian population in bosnia has , it should seek within their own country , as opposed to in connection with croatia . 
  and surely it was dominantly croatia that made its own independence a reality , whereas all diaspora including bosnian definitely helped in many ways . 
  which has no bearing on the borders of any country . 
  sadly , croatia did involve itself in the bosnian conflict directly , with results such as la\u0161va valley , ahmi\u0107i and mostrums like boban , bla\u0161ki\u0107 and kordic . 
  history of this criminal enterprise is now been judged as such by the icty . 
  these were actions opposed by the croatian opposition at the time , but we too were in the grips of an authoritarian right-wing rule of tudjman . 
  why would you choose to make your points an angry faux history lesson , with a lot of heat and no actual points made ? 
  we 're just conversing here you know ... 
  ehhh , no thx . 
  rather they finally create a functioning state for themselves , and learn to live with their actual neighbors , than continue dreaming of links with a country they were never a part of to begin with . 
  as far as rs is concerned , yeah i do n't see how its secession is avoidable , though insisting on a protectorate status for some decades , to allow for any return after massive ethnic cleansing might be fine . 
  trouble it apparently its fairly dysfunctional in that state . 
  uhh , well my perspective must be quite different ; it was a campaign of violence against civilians , terror to ethnically cleanse the albanian population from kosovo , and creating a humanitarian crisis in kosovo that provoked the intervention . 
  this is as far as i know in line with the findings of icty on the matter - eg http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/icty-uphelds-verdict-for-kosovo-war-crimes  there was a broad campaign of violence directed against the kosovo albanian civilian population conducted by forces under the control of the [ yugoslav ] and serbian authorities , during which there were incidents of killing , sexual assault , and the intentional destruction of mosques '' . 
   the verdict also said that `` it was the deliberate actions of these forces during this campaign that caused the departure of at least 700,000 kosovo albanians from kosovo in the short period of time between the end of march and beginning of june 1999 '' . 
  on the other hand , there seems far less guilt established by the court for the kosovar side , with their pm being acquitted :  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-20536318 icty rulings , again , seem to paint a fairly one-sided picture of the yugoslav wars . 
  i do n't like the fact a uniting for peace resolution was not sought for legitimating the intervention formally . 
  but intervention was both legitimate and necessary . 
  and in the end , the act of declaration of independence itself is not illegal - but a matter of political judgement - according to the international court of justice opinion on the matter . 
  which is fairly sensible given how many current countries are a product of unilateral declarations of independence . 
  its a localized conflict , that is true , so perhaps her areas are just not the ones hit - but as far as one can gather from the media , no doubt where it is on , it is fairly conventional warfare . 
  tank columns battling etc. 
  mostly agreed . 
  only re defense budgets - we could do a lot more with the budgets we 've got . 
  its a matter of building a defense union , for as things stand , we spend collectively a third of what the us does - this is no peanuts . 
  yet the combined military effectiveness is not one tenth of it . 
  bunch of duplication of expenses , lots of forces perhaps of use in the case of a replay of the battle of kursk , but not really effective in contemporary peacekeeping , etc. 
  treaties allow us to do so . 
  i hope this crisis is a wakeup call for this to happen . 
  re iraq , yeah partially it was liberalism at least used to justify the intervention . 
  but there was so much wrong there . 
  what i find totally unacceptable is the disregard for international law . 
  us has never been too keen on following it , since it just ties its hands . 
  but it had no legitimacy in interfering .
