  no transitional period there . 
  hopefully . 
  eurocorps at least usually do operate within nato . 
  http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_50088.htm and i think eu battlegroups would be outside their mandate here - they 're a rapid reaction force for peacekeeping , crisis response , humanitarian and rescue tasks - petersberg tasks . 
  not a self-defense aid for members . 
  though i guess this could easily change . 
  what ? 
  really ? 
  going around a stone rubs them the wrong way or ? 
  think i can see why you found these off base - i 'm not discussing a rational philosophical system of morality , but a pre-reflexive `` good base '' , which i 'm comfortable calling morality as well , and which you claimed to be giveable by a religion , whilst it seems innate and pre-human to me . 
  i fully agree that if morality is semantically restricted to the latter , it is uniquely human and even uniquely adult human of sufficient education of certain kind or at least of sufficient inclination to reflection on otherwise automatically followed customs - but also then restricted only to actual acts of ethical reflection , rather than something aided by a religion . 
  which is more likely codifying the hodge podge of `` ethical '' or social instincts and customs at the time of its creation . 
  slavery example is an interesting one , agreed - but not one that supports such a case , as it was supported both by the religion of the time , as well as by the next one in those areas - namely , christianity , both in sacred texts and practice until societal and economic pressures made it untenable . 
  given your example , it would seem not even philosophical reflection on the matter aided much in the moral progress in this case . 
  one might cynically note that beyond the hodge podge of instincts thankfully allowing for societal cooperation and the like for the most part , we do n't seem to get much practical mileage from moral judgements in the stricter sense in the workings of our societies at all . 
   here you lost me , mind offering this more precise way ? 
  the trolley problem is an example of an ethical paradox , so using it in a study to gouge ethical understanding seems pointless , as it is an idea with with to examine ethical systems hm , well actually it was used - and widely reported on - in neuroethics and cognitive science , to study ( a dissociation between moral judgments and justifications , hauser , cushman , young , jin and mikhail , mind & language , vol . 
  1 february 2007 ) whether social position like gender , education , cultural background and the like would have interesting effects on the responses of naive participants - to probe whether there is a kind of universal moral grammar consistent across such factors . 
  neuroethical part , studying what kinds of processing happens for different variations of the experiment , i 've already talked about . 
  it demonstrates how very different considerations - and emotional/social ones rather than cognitive - dominate in selecting differently for the case of the fat man for most people . 
  fairness was not my unique target ( randomly , i mentioned altruism and compassion as well - not an exhaustive list by any metric ) - just one that i felt needed a response since your claim on it - that it is known by lions seems obviously factually incorrect . 
  as defined it is an example of a fairly sophisticated moral judgement ; you seem to insist it is primitive without backing that up - a failing imho in an otherwise much better exchange than i hoped for . 
  i defined it even , to no effect . 
  again any particular research on fairness , in the sense i used , in cognitively simpler mammals you could point to ? 
  i must say i 'm surprised you think fairness to be so simplistic ; this result was actually perceived as quite unexpected ; ted talk even quotes a letter by a philosopher claiming the notion originated in the french revolution so could n't possibly be found in other apes . 
  as to its bearing on morality , i 'm not sure i 'd wish to allow you to restrict the use of the term as narrowly as above - i 've given a fair number of examples where the actual use of the term is obviously meant wider , and even ones which in those uses did include child and animal behaviors . 
  to widen the scope as you seem to be under the impression my point was really only about fairness , other examples studied include say : altruistic cooperation , empathy , bearing in mind a distinction between emotional contagion and cognitive perspective-taking , and reciprocity . 
  could you clarify this claim :  fairness by definition is subject to circumstance , an ethical system by definition is not affected by circumstance . 
  would n't say a consequentialist ethical judgement be quite circumstantial , just as much and in exactly the same way as deciding whether some distribution is sufficiently fair to be acceptable ? 
  in what sense is an ethical system such as that different than accounting for an innate preference to fairness in exchanges ? 
  either or ? 
  more likely both . 
  oh no doubt its debated - but just so is religious role , if any , in moral standards . 
  and y , think the argument is that we can trace various rudiments of what we call morality in humans all the way down to rats . 
  the sufficient point to make here is a gradual evolutionary development of traits constitutive of morality , which does n't really allow for idiosyncratic cultural constructs to have a key role . 
  for a non-animal strain of argumentation here , you can take the intercultural results of the trolley , transplant and similar variants of ethical problems - you can get a significant level of consistency in the responses across cultures ( though apparently interesting differences have been uncovered over time ) -- when the fmri seem to suggest the differences in the switch vs fat man variants is in the emotional activation and regions related to response conflict getting highly activated in the fat man scenario , vs activity in the higher cognitive functions in the switch scenario . 
  again pointing to biologically fixed , emotive and patchwork nature of moral reasoning , rather than dependent on particular learned cultures . 
  i think the more vocal name in making the argument that morality proper - just like in humans - is indeed observed in our closes primate cousins is frans de waal , so no surprise goodall would have a different take ( though idk if this is the case or not , i 'll take your word for it ) . 
  as you can see in the quotes provided ( here 's another one - http://www.ted.com/talks/frans_de_waal_do_animals_have_morals ) he sees no problem in calling these morality - so your claim that chimps have no sense of morality is - just as heavily debatable ( and counterexamples you give at first glance seem just as typical of human behavior as well -- having lived through a war and having been abandoned by my father , they even strike close to home ) your claim lions know of fairness seems highly dubious - check out the definition - this is about a distributive justice ; if you accept an unfair offer , both of you profit , if you reject it neither gets anything ; will you accept an unbalanced offer - humans and chimps seem not to beyond some minimal threshold , while the selfish thing , what you 'd do if you had no notion of fairness is to always accept the offer - this is the research pointing to the notion of fairness in chimps , can you link something similar re lions ? 
  surely you 've heard of the kind of research i was flippantly pointing at there - a random result : http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2011/08/18/why-we-care-about-chimpanzees-the-origins-of-human-morality/ or even http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/19/health/chimpanzee-fairness-morality/ or http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/wildlife/5373379/animals-can-tell-right-from-wrong.html altruism , compassion , fairness seem to predate humanity , let alone religions . 
  which reminds me of humean , moral sense theory perspective on metaethics . 
  chimpanzees must be fairly religious then ... : /, 
   christianity spread a lot of decent values back in the day not that sure about values but at least in preserving the roman culture etc , i 'd say it was a positive intellectual influence up to say 12-14ish ct. 
  still we 're talking about russian tzarism and orthodoxy as it worked in 1917 and there vs stalinist communism . 
  i really do n't think either has the obvious moral upper ground . 
  edit : if it is n't clear what i 'm aiming at , things like , brutal repression of political opponents , intensified pogroms of jews under nicholas ii , who ended up canonized as a saint , and having a close relationship with christian mystics like rasputin . 
  did n't hear that one . 
  but i think its fairly easy to see what provoked this crisis . 
  ukrainian selfdetermination , when it does n't turn eastwards ... 
  its really horrible , ca n't recommend it for croatian . 
  if i ca n't read something i find online , i might use translate , but only to translate to english , which is not nearly that bad . 
  d/k anything about online croatian lessons , sorry . 
  perhaps someone else sees the q. . 
  but you might say `` ljubim te '' as well , right ? 
  here it would be a bit odd but not unheard of . 
  finding some croatian nationalist or religious examples that could n't possibly be literal , but they 're disgusting ... edit3 : much better one : radojka sverko , patriotic rather than repulsive : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hngc8hhwd2i, 
  ear oil ? 
  that 's what translate.google think first one means  rofl, 
  no way !, 
  how odd :d, 
  ah , yeah i would guess its complicated for a non-native speaker . 
  and i 'm guilty of ignoring other people 's attempts at croatian and just speaking english too , sry  its an opportunity to practice english after all , plus its easier :p `` engleski '' here seems to be just following this table ( keeping in mind the noun is really `` jezik '' , masculine , is singular and the case is genitive - answering the question ( lack ) of whom or what ) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbo-croatian_grammar#adjectives `` namjerno '' is n't just due to the case since that 's the adverb , as if you said `` lack of english is deliberately/intentionally '' rather than `` deliberate/intentional '' . 
  and you would n't say just `` agree '' either , 
  fair point , its correct for `` i love you '' . 
  edit : though it does n't offer another form on the dropdown , literally translating this to `` ja te volim '' , but does offer an incorrect one `` te volim '' so still a bit flaky . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngk7cy0wg1q :d reading it out aloud is robotic , i get it , not sure what a non-speaker would get from it . 
  but we 're not reading it out in this thread anyhow . 
  would you trust it ? 
  its fairly pathetic for croatian at least . 
  ufufuf hope your mandarin sounds better :p ( sla\u017eem ** se ** , ... nedostatak englesk ** og ** je namjer ** an ** ), 
  ali fali ti jedini jezik koji je bitan :d * but you 're missing the only language that is important :d *, 
  in my country ? 
  the other poster is right , it really is like picking a favorite std . 
  i 'd go with pusic i guess . 
  i should be closer to holy but i facepalm too often when i hear her speak . 
  and for the fact her greens , as opposed to the liberals , have hypocritically been the leading advocates of e-cigarette and suns prohibitions in the ep ; gmo and nuclear opponents etc. 
  pusic has consistently defended liberal values in this society , supporting the lgbt movement from the start , promoting a stricter separation of church and state , she had the guts to call croatian incursions into bosnia and hercegovina aggression in the hot nationalist climate of the 90s etc. 
  she did take at least some courageous positions when it mattered during her long political career , and continues to present an economically and socially liberal option for a society not too inclined towards either . 
  i think a limited escalation is perfectly realistic , and in line with the nuclear doctrine of nato members . 
  first you fight a conventional war . 
  then you start with tactical nukes here and there ... escalating step by step towards a full strategic launch . 
  the slippery slope of this conflict is what 's scary , and why its been avoided for so long under far more antagonistic relations , for escalating at each step forward a bit is plausible , while the end point of the slope is a global wasteland . 
  nope , you 've got the institutions mixed up . 
  commission would be most similar to an executive . 
  council of the european union ( = council of ministers , informally ) has some executive functions , though its mostly the co-legislature with the parliament . 
  european council , a different body ( and which has nothing to do with the council of europe , a completely different institution ) , is the strategic deliberative body . 
  it is the council of the heads of governments of the eu . 
  it is the collective presidency of the eu . 
  it does n't directly participate in day-to-day running of european affairs . 
  apart from this role we 're seeing now , in co-deciding top eu positions , lisbon treaty states it is a body which `` shall provide the union with the necessary impetus for its development '' . 
  it is also invoked to `` settle issues outstanding from discussions at a lower level '' and in treaty revision procedures . 
  oh also article 7 procedure for suspending a country due to `` fundamental values '' breach , maybe in international treaty ratifications - not sure about the last one . 
  the body and the president of it are powerful , i agree - but mostly informally . 
  just like the high representative - who also chairs , this time the foreign affairs ministers - but also at least has substantial formal powers , being simultaneously the comissioner and cluster leader for foreign-affairs related portfolios , agencies , directorate-generals etc. 
  he certainly does n't execute the will of the council , he just greases the wheels of negotiations and horse-trading between the heads of states , who have the actual say . 
  execution is up to the commission and individual governments . 
  even legislative agenda-setting is up to the commission . 
  he is elected , by a qualified ( super ) majority . 
  art15 teu , point 5 : `` 5 . 
  the european council shall elect its president , by a qualified majority , for a term of two and a half years , renewable once .
