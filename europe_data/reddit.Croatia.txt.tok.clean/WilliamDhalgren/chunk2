  changing what membership means just because this would suit the uk - why would we bother ? 
  free movement of workers matter is certainly a case in point . 
  it is absolutely impossible for it to change ; requirement to do so is treaty revision - unanimous vote by all member states , ratification in all parliaments and ratification in the european parliament . 
  i ca n't see it passing any of those 3 steps . 
  nobody , even non-members like norway or switzerland has an exception there . 
  not even when a referendum in the country forces the matter - comission simply rejects any changes on the matter ( switzerland again ) . 
  this ability to live anywhere in the eu is a freedom with a really broad support , and on the contrary to change it would require really wide agreement . 
  further , the eu is rather interested in deepening the single market ( and has to a significant extent during the outgoing barosso ii commission ) , including , to some extent , the movement of workers . 
  why pick politically impossible fights ? 
  why not cap for eg , that might happen ( theoretically at least ) , in that exceptions exist etc ? 
  or even better , practical matters , defined by ordinary legislative procedure rather than by treaties - imho the greatest value of uk in the eu its is consistent support for free markets , more effective regulation etc. 
  and there 's a ton of regulatory burdain that could and should be shed . 
  free movement of goods , services , capital and workers is the definition of single market . 
  which is at core of the eu project . 
  if even that does n't suit it , why is it a member even ? 
   `` access '' to the single market , no , we just have a trade agreement - a fta , not a common market , certainly not a single market . 
  sure i do n't think there would be any problem signing a trade agreement with the uk should it leave . 
  this is far from comprehensiveness of the acquis in trade restrictions it removes ( it would n't practically even be possible without a common authority and regulatory bodies to do too much on non-tariff barriers to trade ) , so i do n't think the advantage needs to be balanced with obligation of free movement . 
  a deeper relationship , like the interlinking bilateral agreements eu has with switzerland - those do . 
  i see i 've been downvoted throughout this thread just for not being pro-eu . 
  are people on here really so opposed to debate they do n't want to even hear the other side ? 
  there 's some debate going on here ? 
  thought we were speaking about article 7 procedure in case of noncompliance with treaties . 
  you asked , i answered a couple of questions . 
  and corrected some claims i thought were factually incorrect . 
  we 'd need to state some opposing views on something to have a debate , no ? 
  really what is there to debate ; its a practical fact that treaty revision wo n't happen that soon , and that uk could n't have chosen a point less likely to change when revision does come back to the table than removing any of the `` 4 freedoms '' . 
  imho better if they advocate opting out of cap , there 's some precedant there at least . 
  though it would likely cost it the rebate but still . . 
  if that makes the uk wish to leave , its their choice , what can anyone really debate there ? 
  i was riled up by the suggestion that majority population of some member state would wish their government breaks the law ? 
  not that they leave , which is certainly their right , but that they stay but ignore the treaties ??? 
  i ca n't even ... idk what to say , is it lack of information so that they think no obligations were signed , do n't know about direct effect and primacy of eu law over national and similar , or are they for real ? 
  what 's the point of signing anything with a country that 'd rather not respect its signatures ? 
  is there really an `` other side '' to this ? 
  that 's precisely what art 7 is for - to make a member state leaving inevitable unless it conforms . 
  there 's no if about it ; free movement of workers is an old and treaty-entrenched principle . 
  no country with access to single market , in or out of the eu ( like switzerland ) can limit it . 
  well its a large voting block and all decisions need a supermajority ; ofc its a large influence . 
  plus this includes unanimous decisons as well ; its a suspension of membership . 
  like treaty revision . 
  article 7 , as well as court in luxemburg can impose fines . 
  contributions are legally binding as well , while payments from the budget can be suspended . 
  ofc if they wish to escalate further by ignoring the fines , then their voting rights can be suspended too in the same article 7 procedure . 
  and correcting this situation ever surely involves paying fines one 's due . 
  or leaving . 
  i think rather if they intend to un-implement the relevant directives and ignore treaties in effect , presumably ignoring luxemburg vedricts that would no doubt be against them , this is a fairly dramatic matter for article 7 procedure ; '' ` serious and persistent breach '' of common values - rule of law specifically - and to be used to suspend any payments ( while maintaining paying obligatons ) and further imposition of fines , and suspension of any voting rights . 
  then they can pay some astronomic bill ( unpaid fines ) to get their voting rights back , or simply leave . 
  basic rule of law is non-negotiable , luxemburg verdicts are binding . 
  directives are binding . 
  treaties are binding . 
  own resources payments are binding . 
  there is nothing to defy here but lawfull order itself , for all of the above should be recognised by any of their courts too . 
  if they ca n't follow their own law , how can they be members of community of law ? 
  thx !, 
  while we 're at it , 2013 data but with graphs over the last decade , from eurostat twitter : overall [ one ] ( https://twitter.com/eu_eurostat/status/468315776278335488/photo/1 ) all member states , in groups of a few per graph : [ 1 ] ( https://twitter.com/eu_eurostat/status/468317940128165890/photo/1 ) [ 2 ] ( https://twitter.com/eu_eurostat/status/468317691447881729/photo/1 ) [ 3 ] ( https://twitter.com/eu_eurostat/status/468317396101775360/photo/1 ) [ 4 ] ( https://twitter.com/eu_eurostat/status/468317123660746752/photo/1 ) [ 5 ] ( https://twitter.com/eu_eurostat/status/468316678250835968/photo/1 ) does in fact show a precipitous fall in irish employment , but recovering between 2012-2013, 
  i think you 're mistaking it for iceland - the first shaded one , right ? 
  ireland 's participation in 2013 is in the lower half , though not particularly low . 
  its current unemployment is above eu average , and similar to euro average , so highish , but not particularly high . 
  perhaps exodus is petering out ? 
   the uk has decided to pay them off instead of continuing to pay interest how does this work - is it at the discretion of the uk to redeem them or not , or can people continue to keep them for interest and/or say historical memorabilia ? 
  if former , how does it work - some clause saying `` you can redeem it when we announce we 'll stop paying the interest '' or ? 
  nono , but things like this http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/file:employment_rate,_age_group_15%e2%80%9364,_2013_%28%25%29_yb15.png but that one is a bit old . 
  that 's percentage of people that are employed in some age-group . 
  you 'd probably be more interested in looking at employment levels , not at unemployment figures . 
  this is really data about the output gap in the economy - people still actively seeking return to some employment . 
  and as you say , it does n't measure underemployment . 
  shouting `` fire ! '', 
  in a theatre is the quintessential example of speech that is n't protected in the usa . 
  are you saying writing `` there 's a bomb on the plane '' on a napkin is different ? 
  and the judge explicitly thought this crime , ie writing `` attention , ebola '' on an open mug in a plane during an ebola epidemic equivalent to that . 
  so no , this is n't protected speech . 
  it could still be draconian , but the case involves limits to speech common to both sides of the atlantic . 
  if the usa were able to keep him on their soil , absolutely - and this was indeed what happened there ; he was subject to your legal process there for crimes commited there . 
  but perhaps you did n't notice i mentioned he fled . 
  so extradition was demanded . 
  well in that situation on the contrary , it is not only not unimportant , but absolutely crucial , how his acts would be treated in the domicile country , would the crime be of similar weight , would the types of punishments he could face be considered proportionate in his domicile country etc. 
  we 're all luckiy its like that , otherwise saudi arabia would have a decent case to ask for our extradition on grounds of blasphemy against allah or something  and i really doubt the usa would extradite you for some such i guess minor hate speech accusations in germany . 
  for the record , i tried to argue that no doubt his crimes are indeed quite serious in any legal system around this side of the atlantic as well , and so that he should be extradited . 
  only that this hinges on fairly solid evidence for him having comitted rape more than merely on statutory limits . 
  since much of it repeats and interprets this article , here 's the original : [ deleveraging ; what deleveraging ? 
  ] ( http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/frommay2014/geneva16.pdf ) ( longish pdf but very skimmable ) . 
  i found the part about 3 types of credit crisis quite fascinating . 
  yeah , was thinking about that , but you could actually say that , `` da ? 
  '' , and it would indeed be understood the same way , and rude for a waiter to do . 
  but sure , its a polite variant of that . 
  edit : i usually get '' \u0161ta \u0107emo ? '', 
  in a local bar . 
  `` what will we ... ? '', 
  hah , funny article , though seems exaggerated . 
  i 'd be pissed if i were ignored for someone to finish a magazine or a cigarette . 
  waiters rather seem to be running around constantly because the minimum number of them is hired for the volume of work . 
  though its true they 're not supposed to communicate much beyond `` izvolite ? '', 
  or a variation thereof , and `` izvolite ! '', 
  when bringing the order , unless drawn into a conversation by the customer . 
  we start to talk , come to casually know each other . 
  best of all , i know that these conversations are genuine , no one is being nice in hopes of getting a bigger tip , yeah , sure ... the author is not nearly cynical enough apparently . 
  no its not for a bigger tip , but being open to such communication is understood to be a part of the job . 
  and an outgoing person will do that work naturally . 
  but its work , not a friendly chat .
