  how could you misunderstood so completely ? 
  nono and no ; rather , their nuclear policy is a rational strategy - for this is the only way for it to be credible . 
  you should therefore read it knowing this is a rational strategy , rather than presume as you do its just a bluff . 
  it may be counterintuitive , especially to a post-cold war era generations , but mutually assured destruction thinking allways has been rather perverse . 
  its a loic of someone unafraid to subject humanity to postapocaliptic future , sure , but i 'd wager they are ready for this . 
  take a look at the rethoric of the height of cold war - arguments that you can win a nuclear exchange , preparations for civilian sheltering against it , desensitizing the population to `` megadeaths '' etc. 
  they have n't lost merely by having a population loss on the order of hundereds of millions , they only lose if they 're out of power or personally dead . 
  and a nuclear exchance is significantly more compatible with that than a conventional defeat or a peace deal in which you are humiliated . 
   there is no need to expect a humiliating defeat . 
  for example , there can be an even playing field in who has one what . 
  there is no need to play it as '' one wins automatically '' . 
  its not a coincidence a nato - russia conflict has not happened yet , despite these relationships being far worse than now in the past . 
  it is precisely because a cycle of mutual escalation is really really difficult to avoid when an open conflict ensues , where nobody can lose face and look weak to the hated enemy or when the powerbase depends on not showing any weaknesses etc. 
  the very term `` cold war '' points to how different this conflict was from any other . 
  normally a direct conventional war would 've happened , but instead you had those simmering indirect conflicts and the like . 
  and it is precisely the credibilty of the nuclear threat that is the only reason this never became a soviet invasion of west europe before . 
  so it is quite incorrect to presume it is not in fact a credible threat . 
  nato has always maintained it will ultimately answer also by nuclear means to a conventional assault on european nato members . 
   there is no guarantee dat nuclear weapons will be used . 
  hence why i say : you dont need to commit suicide . 
  at least try to survive , and if nuclear warms will be used , you 're gone anyways . 
  i judge the chances of ww3 not turning nuclear to be low . 
  i judge killing poor , probably mostly young and foolish shmucks that are fighting for `` their country '' , to be rather most horrible way of spending your last days on the planet . 
  be it a random bullet , or a fiery inferno , cancer from irradiation with no access to painkillers , or the starvation of nuclear winter , dying in such an apocalyptic war and its aftermath is a pointless and unpleasent affair . 
  i can only hope a nuclear strike is close enough to simply vaporise me on the spot , but i can not count on this . 
  and for most of these options , by the time you know for sure it really is too late for this planet , it is really too late to choose your exit as well . 
  killing myself i judge to be generally permissible , for i 'm the owner of my life and only ultimate arbiter of what is to be done with it . 
  collecting my thoughts and doing so in a painless manner seems better than anything a post ww3 world is likely to offer . 
  but you see the entire power of the weapon lies in the credibility of their nuclear commitment . 
  it is naive hence to dismiss them like that . 
  they will likely do exactly as they say in their policies - for the entire thing is useless unless credible enough for an even warmongering enemy that might easily doubt your seriousness to have to take seriously . 
  particularly naive to ignore given how close at times we were to casually launching nukes regardless . 
  interesting how a ww3 needs be dilluted in `` few years of fighting and then suing for peace '' - ie a limited conflict scenario . 
  yet neither world war ended without a complete systemic failure of one of the parties , and a humiliating defeat . 
  which is prob less appealing than fighting for however slim a chance of winning to a politician otherwise forced to such humiliation . 
  they are n't in power to save a planet , or to give a single shit about it really , but only to make their party come out on top . 
  and if they take out enough of the nuclear capabilities of the opponent quickly enough , perhaps they could limit the direct casualties to mere say hundereds of millions . 
  and then work to survive the nuclear winter as best as possible with the remaining population ... 
  anyhow i do n't think it likely at all that such a conflict would n't become a full launch and rather quickly , and besides its certainly not a gamble i 'm willing to take . 
  fire is a nasty way to go , as opposed to an exit bag or a shotgon to the head . 
  as is cancer , especially lacking resources for medical care . 
  and a post-exchange world is likely too much of a loss of civilization to be of interest to persist in , and unlikely to recover within an ( irradiated ) lifetime , even if it it avoids obliterating humanity utterly . 
  both parties nuclear doctrine mandates an all-out nuclear launch if they 're losing . 
  and both ca n't be winning . 
  and both parties know it . 
  and the one to launch first gets hit less , so both wan na launch as fast as necessary if unavoidable . 
  it is really very difficult to see a direct and full-scale confrontation of russa and nato becoming anything other than a total strategic nuclear launch . 
  enemy ? 
  who is supposed to be the enemy ? 
  whose enemy ? 
  why bother killing anyone given that they wo n't survive anyhow ? 
  ww3 is an apocalyptic scenario , all you have left is choosing your method of death anyhow . 
  and i 'd rather die without becoming a murderer first . 
  i 'd commit suicide . 
  ww3 means all-out conflict of nuclear superpowers . 
  there is nothing to fight over then , nothing left to protect at all , and nowhere to run . 
  as note elsewhere , actually there is nothing at all supportive of gay marriage in the final voted version of this resolution . 
  there was some mildly supportive paragraph in the draft , but got amended away . 
  also , croatia and i gather hungary as well , do have civil unions that are roughly on par with marriage rights . 
  should n't be any worse than germany , czech r , switzerland , austria since we basically copied those . 
  though its only just been introduced , so not sure how well it works in practice . 
  only difference that is envisioned is in re to adoption . 
  in contrast , italy has nothing . 
  yet . 
  the treaty has been dead for many years now . 
  this was simply pulling the final plug on a vegetating patient ( indefinitely suspended treaty ) . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/treaty_on_conventional_armed_forces_in_europe#suspension_by_russia  after russia was not willing to support the us missile defense plans in europe , russian president vladimir putin called for `` moratorium '' on the treaty in his april 26 , 2007 address . 
  then he raised most of his points for rewriting the treaty during the extraordinary conference of states parties to the treaty on conventional forces in europe , held in vienna on june 11 -- 15 at russia 's initiative . 
  [ 14 ] as his requests were not met during this conference , putin issued a decree intended to suspend the observance of its treaty obligations on july 14 , 2007 , effective 150 days later , stating that it was the result of `` extraordinary circumstances ( ... ) which affect the security of the russian federation and require immediate measures , '' and notified nato and its members . 
  [ 15 ] [ 16 ] the suspension applies to the original cfe treaty , as well as to the follow-up agreements . 
  nice catch !, 
  heh , it did in fact get watered down :  ** takes note ** of the legalisation of same-sex marriage or same-sex civil unions in an increasing number of countries -- 17 to date -- around the world ; encourages the eu institutions and the member states to further contribute to ** reflection on the recognition ** of same-sex marriage or same-sex civil union as a political , social and human and civil rights issue ;, 
  but there 's [ 260 + pages ] ( http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getdoc.do?pubref=-//ep//nonsgml+comparl+pe-544.314+01+doc+pdf+v0//en&amp;language=en ) of proposed amendments to that draft . 
  i have no idea what wording passed exactly . 
  well ofc one would run away along with the family . 
  who in their right mind would leave them behind ? 
  also , being gay my status in the macho hierarchy is a bit ambiguous anyhow ... 
  given that the only possible enemy has nukes , and lots of them , no doubt . 
  borders are not worth losing one 's head over . 
  life is precious ; territory , a commodity to be bought and sold . 
  especially when the enemy has nukes :d but considering that , and that a nato country has been attacked in such a scenario , where does one run exactly ? 
  to antarctica ? 
  what do you mean a try ? 
  communist countries at least have had mandatory military service for all able men . 
  its more a conditional return to past traditions . 
   which allows to mobilize every polish citizen to take part in military training if there will be need . 
  so this is n't a reintroduction of obligatory military service training , but opening the possibility of doing so en masse if needed ? 
  wonder about the logistics of trying to train many people at once like that , as opposed to doing is generationally like with regular obligatory military training we had in the past regime . 
  anyhow , point is dispelling the overpopulation myth generally is valid but besides the point if the matter at hand are developed country 's birthrates , rather than the 3rd world . 
  oh wow , from poor links to utterly pathetic shit with sentences like this :  hydrocarbons which they claim are causing global warming - an issue on which there is considerable and continuing scientific doubt , as shown in an excellent survey of the evidence by a former green , bjorn lomberg in his the sceptical environmentalist, 
  does it ? 
  for one its just an editorial piece in salon . 
  further , it seems to restate and support the basic premise behind this thinking -  for instance , the carbon emissions of one american is the same as that of 20 indians , 30 pakistanis , 40 nigerians and 250 ethiopians . . suggest that places like europe are the last place in the world where you want to see more babies getting born . 
  admittedly it says things like  that puts the onus right back on the conspicuous consumers to do something about their economic systems but this is just incredibly naive wishful thinking - economic systems changing ? 
  simply wo n't happen . 
  we will all inevitably continue to consume increasing amounts of everything there is to consume , because near-everyone individually wants to consume a bit more then they do . 
   for fuck sake , if you really believe in your clear cut theory execute it on a monkey or a mouse . 
  just an head autotransplant would be enought . 
  um , has n't that been done already , by robert white in 70s , and again in 00s ? 
  though paraplegia does seem likely , but apparently is acceptible as the patient ( one i saw mentioned previously at least ) is dying with spinal muscular atrophy anyhow .
