  hm , strange he 'd have the power to do so . 
  how ? 
  theoretically speaking , easier labor mobility should be economically beneficial . 
  but yeah , surely this party is trying to push for the interests of the group they represent . 
  what else is a party supposed to do but represent the interests of its voters ? 
  it does ? 
  seems to me if these citizens want a particular type of policy , they have a right to vote for it . 
  their citizenship is not junior to the ethnic danish . 
  moreover , having parties form on the basis of ethnic background is extremely common , and such a party 's main duty is precisely to push for the interests of the respective ethnicity or aligned interests of their ethnicities . 
  well that is actually more a counterexample than an example , i think , for i would n't think it either fair or prudent to call say flemish people `` flemish-speaking belgians '' . 
  rather than purely a linguistic matter , this pillarised society has everything split by ethnic lines . 
  here it is clearly a matter of distinct ethnic identity , and not a merely linguistic split . 
  see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flemish_people and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walloons, 
  right , quite similar , did n't think of that - thx for the comparison . 
  occasionally drinking some iodine pills in areas close to a plant giving gigawatts does n't seem like much of a downside . 
  managing an evacuation and maintaining thousands of square kilometers large exclusion zone ala fukushima is the reasonable worst-case scenario , quite unlikely to strike anyone living next to a plant in their lifetimes , and that should take a few decades to clean up , rather than centuries . 
  anyhow , hopefully such areas near nuclear plants would have depressed real estate prices , yet solid realistic conditions , so might be a financial boon to poor people undaunted by the scarecrow of potential radiation . 
  i was n't following closely enough - how is this schulz 's fault ? 
  thought it was just that the 7th member party left the group . 
  at which point they do n't qualify to form a group . 
  if a croat converts to islam he certainly does n't become bosniak . 
  and we also have a bosniak minority . 
  ethnicity is inherited , so even if the split came about by geography and religion , changing either or both of those does n't transmute the identity . 
  so bosniak minority would be the people whose families have historic ties to the bosnian region , be these recent ( for eg war refugees ) or older ( for eg labor mobility in one of the yugoslavias , or in austrohungary which controlled bosnia since 1878 ) arrivals . 
  a majority of which would be muslim , due to ottoman conquests . 
  there was quite a lot of intermarriage and the like during that period , but then identities fissured again , never quite neglected . 
  as to the 159 muslim montenegrins , idk , but for such a low number could be recent migration of people with historic ties to montenergin area ( or say during yugoslavia ) . 
  you ca n't tell me you 're seriously surprised by balkan ethnic identities being balkanized ? 
  heh , you think techcraft runs in families ? 
  :d but anyway , he 'd have to get nominated by finland to become a commissioner . 
  and then katainen could n't be a commissioner . 
  who got an even stronger jobs , growth , investment and competitiveness vicepresidential portfolio . 
  we 'd have to get rid of this countries nominate comissioners , and commisioner per country principle for this to be possible . 
  right , makes sense . 
  oh , no doubt they 'd be well integrated and learn finnish - interesting how you 'd consider the question from the linguistic perspective again , perhaps hilightling a different `` instinct '' for basis of minority identity - from my perspective , they could even have only finnish as their mother tounge but still have a notion of being of different ethnicity . 
  or of dual ethnicity in some other cultures , like in the usa where you get say croatian-americans ( or < something  - american generally ) that ca n't speak croatian at all , or pretty badly . 
  another q if i may - so is there then a different ( presumably much smaller ) minority of domicile ethnic swedes , say those whose families came to finland some time ago , that would consider themselves swedish ? 
  or do these get integrated somehow with the swedish-speaking population and come to consider themselves finnish instead ? 
  so it is indeed a different thing than with minorities i 've known , interesting , thx . 
  yeah i just answered to the other poster below on that - it is in fact a bit odd to me , we apparently use a different concept of ethnicity here in the balkans . 
  i mean , i can only imagine the shitstorm that would happen if we choose to speak of the serbian minority as being `` serbian-speaking croats '' . 
  and they 've also been here forever , like a number of other ethnic minorities . 
  or is this really different , and swedish-speaking minority in finland sees itself as ethnically finnish ? 
  ie not as a domicile ethnic minority , but as only a linguistic minority ( this classification itself is quite alien to me ) ? 
  hm , the concept is a bit odd for me , its not how minorities are counted in croatia at least . 
  i would n't for eg . 
  say croatia has an italian-speaking minority , implying the ` yre ( also ) croats but speak italian - i 'd say we have an italian minority , ie . 
  they 're ethnically italian . 
  we 'd say they 're croatian citizens of italian ethnicity . 
  is this a different way of saying the same thing - or would you make a distinciton between swedish speaking finns and ( ethnically ) swedish minority in finland ? 
  i thought linus was finnish ? 
  yet his father is an mep for a swedish minority party ? 
  and indeed the wiki states :  his family belongs to the swedish-speaking minority ( 5.5 % of finland 's population ) . 
  another til moment for me . 
   it 's even what economists and virtually every economic body propose : indeed , its just simple macro , far less controversial in the economics mainstream than it apparently is in politics . 
  fortunately that enabled some renewed large-scaled empirical tests of the theories , with different countries choosing different approaches , and with predictable results . 
  i 'd disagree re france in its current situation though ; for legal reasons more than economics mostly - they have the leasure to close their excessive debt at a fairly mild pace anyhow , and provided others would offset and more with stimulus theor effort is not essential for a modest overall macro effect ; further , the basic rule on limiting debt and deficit is sound , given sufficient flexibility on the exact trajectory and measures to achieve this , so should be followed as law even when not immediately beneficial . 
  italy is in a much better position though ; they 're neither bumping the deficit target , and investment spending can be ( and is i think ) exempt when aiming at the debt target , plus they show more political strength to deal with the structural problems at this point . 
  the core issue here is insufficient fiscal capacities at the union level when monetary policy is near-exhausted . 
  on a common level , germany really really should spend more ; but from its local perspective , its not a particularly pressing need , so is easily overriden by politics . 
  and where the need is fairly strong , they 've spent the agreed breath of fiscal space procyclically in the boom period , so ca n't do much but procyclically contract either . 
  at least the situation is not as asymmetric as in the height of the crisis ; overall inflation is too low justifying further unconventional efforts - rather than being near-impotent unless dabbling in controversial asymmetric programmes ; overall growth is comparably bad , so there might be the will to act on it . 
   ukip leader nigel farage said : `` it is impossible to change the free movement of peoples within europe without a fundamental treaty change with 27 other european countries . 
   `` nobody wants it , nobody is interested , and the prime minister knows it 's not possible . '', 
  quite right , though i feel odd for agreeing with farage . 
  should add that its also unnecessary to try to renegotiate anything on that matter ; for whatever legitimate measure at protecting the state budget from abuses , or maintaining public order is wanted , is also doable by national laws , and requires no renegotiation . 
  unlike limiting free movement of workers as such , which apart from having little chance of flying in the eu , is economically both unnecessary and counterproductive . 
  on the contrary , eu is interested in boosting intra-eu mobility , since its really low , yet is a usable tool for adjustment to asymmetric economic shock like the recent/ongoing one . 
  they might have a better chance of success if the target was non-eu migration . 
  not only that - even if nobody at all believed them , there are still large institutional investors like pension funds that have to keep a substantial portion of their portfolio low risk , and its precisely these ratings that are specified in their regulation , as a way of limiting their risk exposure . 
  italy must not beat us to bronze !, 
  are we pulling ahead or are they closing in ? 
  slovenia gave a list of candidates for juncker to choose from - with more women on it ( mep tanja fajon ) , so maybe not . 
  euractiv explains that the parliament asked for navracsics to be given a different portfolio , not to be removed . 
  http://www.euractiv.com/sections/eu-elections-2014/parliament-leaves-juncker-no-choice-re-shuffle-his-team-308965  the committee ** voted to accept tibor navracsics in another role ** in the european commission , but asked its incoming president , jean-claude juncker , not to assign him the education , culture , youth and citizenship portfolio that juncker had originally proposed . 
  `` black as midnight on a moonless night '' , is i think the twin peaks line . 
  i think you misread - he ` became ' ` white ' with the earliest mediterraneans , yet the blonde version :  ... would have ** followed along ** whenever ** those ** groups converted . 
  ie , later on , with germanic groups, 
   you can not compare the eu with the uk or the us , since the uk and us are states , while the eu is no state . 
  politically , agreed . 
  in terms of monetary system , ecb and fed are quite similar , except its mandate is modeled after the bundesbank . 
  the differences in mandate are not due to statehood or not , but due to being faithfully modeled after this german tradition . 
   not allowed to transfer risks from some countries to others . 
  you think so ? 
  apparently it thinks it can , with the omt programme , currently active . 
  luxemburg will have to answer that one . 
  anyhow , a qe is even less asymmetric than that , so not sure what transfers you 're talking about , since it can just buy up bonds in say proportion to country shares in the ecb capital . 
  even bundesbank agrees this is squarely within its mandate . 
  i think draghi personally has done a great job - you should compare his whatever it takes and unconventional policies he 's obviously pushed through , since a few were not unanimous , to raising the interest rate in the midst of recession , which is what his predecessor trichet did . 
  though the obvious suspects among the governors of the ecb certainly have n't helped . 
  but even that 's not blocking actions , thx to majority voting and rotation , as much as legal uncertainty over the extent of its mandate when it comes to unconventional policies . 
  omt case will be a fascinating test thereof , and qe be almost impossible ( barring acute and intense manifest political danger ) , until that is clearly answered . 
  to put it concretely , if an eu qe did n't entail explicitly buying up sovereign debt of italy and the like ( say due to having either paneuropean debt or more substantial private debt markets ) , politically spinable for domestic consumption in the north , it would have happened when it economically should have , couple of years ago . 
  just like it did in the us , uk etc. 
  even with its totally federal structure , ecb is just too young an institution , and the political community it backs too novel an entity , to be able to cope with confidence with the scale of unconventional measures required to deal with this once-in-a-lifetime calamity . 
  have n't noticed any significant shifts ; been following it through the worst of the crisis too . 
  both positions have had substantial representation around here , exact balances shift easily depending on the post . 
  maybe your comments improved , or just random variation ? 
  cost/effect of current defense spending in member states is poor ; think the numbers were , third of us spending for a tenth of capability - that should rather be improved , via integrating defense systems , rather than spending more , especially now . 
   a linguistic issue can be political as well , in the same sense creationism or climate change can - only iff it is politicized .
