  should at least go through the motions even then . 
  and i really do n't get why nato actions consistently fail to seek at least a unga support even if blocked . 
  eu members are supposed to care about respect for international law , even if us does n't ; the entire thing is itself build out of international law after all ... 
  they will ? 
  what 's wrong with the current moderates in the people 's eyes ? 
  thought things were going fairly well in poland , especially considering the continental situation, 
  why would the uk be treated any differently than any other country ? 
  surely many have significant regional variations . 
  this is a `` by country '' map . 
  unless wales , scotland , and/or northern ireland secedes , on this kind of map it will be lumped together . 
  sounds fun . 
  damn you , now i 'm saddened by both the maps . 
  economy is depressing , when depressed  come on , give me a justice scorecard map so i can get even sadder , 
  seems reasonable at least , then . 
  a swift application pledge would be laughable . 
  i could actually see this happening , given some favorable assumptions . 
  eu institutions are shaped fairly federally . 
  treaties leave significant room for a coalition of willing to integrate much further , like in foreign policy , defense , fiscal , tax policy and the like . 
  changing many ? 
  most ? 
  voting rules from unanimity to majority is likewise doable without any treaty changes or approval from the uk by such a coalition . 
  few can not be done , like in defense . 
  some changes in that direction are about to happen automatically , like the easier majority voting and jurisdiction over implementation of directives in the area of justice . 
  some integration can be done with aditional treaties . 
  so really the existing structure leaves a wide amount of unused space for further integration . 
  and the difference between the eu as it currently is and a proper federation is more quantitative than qualitative . 
  eg , i think the moment majority voting in foreign policy were chosen , eu is for all intents and purposes a federal entity , however loose it may be in other fields . 
  i just think many big players will be unwilling to leave the uk out of such an entity for as long as possible , so it wo n't practically happen . 
  we 'll see how the british question will be resolved . 
  more opt outs and less cash in exchange for losing those vetos seems plausible to me , as long as no opting out of the four single market freedoms , including workforce migration , is attempted . 
  a far better deal than norway , for much less actual participation . 
  there 's barely anything left to balkanize even further here . 
  . . of most of great britain ; it would lose only 78,387 / 229,848 = 34.1 % territory , not half . 
  so , ukmgbni, 
  its really none of my business to comment either way , but intimately i do have a preference ^ ^ ^ ^ yay, 
   the aryan tribe and its superior genetic makeup overpowered the primitive darker skinned hunter-gatherers . 
  huh , interesting given :  the hunters ... genes live on in modern europeans , to a greater extent in the north-east than in the south . 
  vs  the early farmer genome showed a completely different pattern , however . 
  her genetic profile was a good match for modern people in sardinia , and was rather different from the indigenous hunters . 
  so til sardinians are the true aryans , vs the comparatively degenerate north europeans : /, 
  any chance spain could get rid of this aggressive idiot soon ? 
  he 's got some nerve talking the about need for integration , while suggesting he might pervert eu accession process for domestic consumption purposes . 
  it increasingly looks like just english , 
  yes , as i said , there are allways adjustment periods , transitions where some rules do n't need to be followed for some period ( like in cleaning up a dirty industry ) , or some protections stay in place for a while etc. 
  and a poor uncompetitive member state has more to gain from structural funds , targeting to a large extent precisely its competitiveness . 
  that 's a subsidy of the state . 
  sectoral subsidies seem more suspect to me than these measures , either in prolonging the status quo and adjusting it slowly , or open calls for anyone satisfying the criteria to submit projects to get funding as structural funds work . 
  there 's also a globalisation fund , not sure how that one works . 
   i think it would be best if each country subsidized a certain sector of their economy for , say , only 10 years to be perfectly clear , this is absolutely illegal . 
  even if the argument would hold - seems a variant of the young industry argument and its not generally accepted , though not without its merit either - its certainly impractical ; government is supposed to distort the competition in the market willingly , who will it benefit , how independent will its decision be , when will it stop with the subsisides and why that cutoff exactly ( 10 years seems as plausible as a 100 ) . 
  and consider the conflicts and subsidy wars that would arise between the member states in such procedures . 
  that 's why the area that for strategic reasons is seen as requiring subsidies , agriculture , is first , done on an euwide scale rather than by member states , and second done in a manner trying to minimize the distortionary effect on the market - amount of subsidy being unrelated to the quantity of produce . 
  i 'm not too happy with the idea of my tax kunas being given to some politican 's cousins or even unknown enterpreneurs , in the hopes this will make for a competitive industry , supposedly , few mandates away . 
  our experience with subsidizing the shipbuilding industry seem singularly negative , one bailout after another bailout and in the end all for nothing . 
  rather , if some investor sees a chance to profit by investing in an industry long-term , they can do so . 
  there are however various structural funds , investment bank programs with developmental focus in the interest of better competition , usually targeting the smes . 
  these can compete to get the funds on an equal footing , in transparent procedures . 
  not of any individual state , but only neutrally across states . 
  the idea is that trying to plan centrally what an economy might be good at is a fool 's errant , one 's better off leaving it to the market to sort out what will work and what wo n't , so one just needs a legislative framework favorable to entrepreneurship and financing thereof . 
   it could lead to monopolies/oligopolies it could . 
  rarely monopolies , but certainly oligopolies , and well typical markets are imperfect in various ways . 
  one does have a fairly strong anticompetitive position in the commission to prevent abuses of dominant market position to prevent entrance of competitors , or leverage to other sectors etc , though this is of limited use . 
  if a certain market is so imperfect that one can substantially undercut an incumbent , then there is a good opportunity for an investor to make money by doing so . 
   but , take for example croatia and even worse bosnia . 
  you guys have tourism , but if we joined eu in a few years , i do n't think we 'd have a single sector which would be competitive in the european market . 
  frankly , its not enough . 
  though i gather retail is doing well also ( konzum/agrokor ) . 
  but its not important what the ownership of the enterprises is ; tcom or tele2 is paying taxes to the croatian state and hiring croatian citizens too , so are the international banks . 
  certainly for the bih to suddenly become a member state , with no transitional provisions and no time to develop etc , would be a huge shock to its economy . 
  usually these things go gradually . 
   there 's no way ukrainian cars can compete with mercs or vws under the same rules . 
  how are these issues addressed in the eu ? 
  easy , by the uncompetitive company going bust . 
  why waste productive resources if the end product ca n't compete neither on quality , nor on price , nor in some specialized niche etc ? 
  why would the consumers subsidize such uncompetitive industries , paying for the higher prices either of the domestic product , or ones extracted via customs as a tax ? 
  that 's kinda the whole point of a single market , to make for a more efficient overall system , everyone should focus on where they have an edge over the competition . 
  and let the rest go bankrupt . 
  well anything less has no legal weight . 
  that route is what the pro-independence vote hopes for . 
  i 'll quote the scottish government 's position ,  how will scotland become an independent member of the european union ? 
   following a vote for independence , the scottish government will immediately enter into negotiations with westminster and eu member states to ensure that an independent scotland achieves a smooth and timely transition to independent membership of the eu . 
  scotland will negotiate the terms of membership of the eu during the period we are still part of the uk and , therefore , part of the eu . 
   there is , within the eu treaties , a legal framework by which scotland , a country that has been an integral part of the eu for 40 years , may make the transition to independent eu membership in the period between the referendum and the date on which scotland becomes an independent state . 
  ** article 48 ** provides a suitable legal route to facilitate the transition process , by ** allowing the eu treaties to be amended through ordinary revision procedure ** before scotland becomes independent , to enable it to become a member state at the point of independence . 
   there is no treaty provision that would require scotland to leave the eu on independence . 
  it would also be against the self-interest of the eu collectively , and of the member states individually , to seek to deprive scotland of eu membership given that scotland is an integral and highly valued part of the single market . 
  throughout its history the guiding principle of the eu has been enlargement of its membership , not contraction . 
  http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2013/11/9348/15 question 256, 
  true , but it also mentions the procedure for treaty revision generally . 
  hard to see a new guy sitting at the eu summit , new guys in the council of ministers configurations , without at least attaching a protocol to define this . 
  that 's art 48 , at least that should apply . 
  that was the option scottish seemed to favor in an article here linked few days ago, 
  ah , sry for the presumption . 
   why would i address a scenario that i believe is nonsense ? 
  huh ? 
  well you also said   firstly mep 's do n't have a veto on this . 
  while regardless of the scenario , art 48 or art 49 , yes they do . 
    in fact rather than nonsense , this is exactly what the eu parliament will prob do ** in the case of art 59 procedure . 
  **  you are entitled to your opinion . 
  but do not claim that there is any legal or factual basis for it .
