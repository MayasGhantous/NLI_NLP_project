  i do n't understand this place . 
   christianity is a poison . 
  no , it 's not . 
  i was so happy , almost like dinamo played , 
  what country are you from ? 
  it sounds so weird and has a lot of `` khgh '' sounds , but i like it . 
  that kate girl is hot . 
  nice joke . 
  yeah , what about momtenegro ? 
  we 're not their neighbours , but we like them !, 
  hahaha great article !, 
  ah , the famous [ ten-day war ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ten-day_war ) . 
  i 'm not saying we should want it , i was just wondering why ca n't we have it when other countries can . 
  why am i being downvoted ? 
  but we changed it two days * before * we joined . 
   several eu member states have the same 2002 time limit , including austria and italy . 
  why ca n't we also have it ? 
  op you see what you did ? 
  now everyone is going to spell it carbage . 
  ever since croatia entered the eu , i do n't know who i am anymore . 
  that 's one fine looking kettle . 
  thanks . 
   ft.com articles are only available to registered users great . 
  what exactly is that action going to accomplish ? 
  because we 're special and awesome !, 
   i do n't know if moving into the eu was right for croatia at this moment in time . 
  why ? 
   it seems like he knows something i would n't be surprised if that 's the case . 
  - it 's between romania and ukraine and it does n't have access to sea - they are in pretty bad economic situation , there are many poor people - many ethnic groups live there ( romanians , russians , ukranians , probably even turks but i 'm not sure ) - capital and the biggest city is ( in croatian ) ki\u0161injev - second biggest city is tiraspol and the best football team in the country - sheriff - is from that city - epic sax guy, 
  i was being sarcastic , but thanks for the info !, 
  because only far right ideologies can lead to violent actions , amirite ? 
  yeah i know it 's old , but i think it 's still relevant . 
  it has nothing to do with you being american . 
  that joke was terrible . 
  call it what you want , it 's not wrong . 
  there 's nothing bad about loving your country . 
  that 's what patriotism is . 
  why ? 
  what are you talking about ? 
  is there something wrong with american patriotism ? 
  i know you 're trying to be funny ... but you 're not . 
  why do you do that with names ? 
  the sad truth is that what you said in that comment is mostly true . 
  the easiest thing to do when you are disagreeing with someone on the internet is just to call him a troll . 
  you do n't have to explain why you disagree or explain your point of view , just call him a troll and bam !, 
  you 're right , he 's wrong . 
  i hate that . 
  that 's a shame but do n't take it personally . 
  maybe remove your flair for a couple of days and see if people will treat you differently . 
  why is that ? 
  only the last one is worth watching . 
  i get chills every time i see that picture . 
  is that the same man that set himself on fire ? 
  you 're welcome !, 
  yes they are . 
  [ here ] ( http://top5ormore.blogspot.com/2008/06/top-5-jokes-about-mujo-haso.html?m=0 ) are some . 
  but keep in mind that most of the jokes are lost in translation , these are not that great but they 're ok . , 
  nah i prefer jokes . 
  haha no croatia, 
  um ... it 's ... in germany ? 
  yeah, 
  because you funny, 
  we joke because * we love you * . 
  we just do n't know any other way to express it . 
  they have the best football league but their national team is n't as good as it once was . 
   i suppose thats what you get for having a country that changed it 's name 3 times in 300 years . 
  how about 6 or 7 times in 100 years ? 
  bosnia . 
  because why the fuck not . 
  plus i already know the language . 
  damn she scared me when she started `` singing '' . 
  what the fuck is that, 
  i like it ray-dee-ohh, 
  i have feeling like he 's spitting all the time . 
  wait a second ... you have beaches in norway ? 
  just stop them from winning the next world cup . 
  oh god no . 
   which is rarely if ever regarded as the `` stereotypical '' balkan music well , i 'm sure foreigners would associate it with balkan when they hear it . 
  that 's why it 's popular . 
  in croatia it would be [ this ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9xztzb2b4q ) one . 
  yeah probably . 
  i would upvote it though , 
  she actually could n't find berlin , not germany . 
  here 's the [ video ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2po6pfynl4 ) . 
  i want to go there . 
  you can make one too !, 
  hungary was n't part of ussr . 
   but of course every nation ( serbs , croats , romanians etc. ), 
  around here holds that it sacrificed itself to halt the turks and so `` saved christian europe '' . 
  is that not true ? 
  angela merkel could n't find germany on the map , so there 's that . 
  and people in prison . 
  like taxi !, 
  but he 's right . 
  tbh , second part of the title is unnecessary . 
  sadly , bosnia can not into anschluss . 
  only can into genocide . 
  is [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/cyvly9j.jpg ) not enough ? 
  bosna , pls . 
  you have your own sea .
