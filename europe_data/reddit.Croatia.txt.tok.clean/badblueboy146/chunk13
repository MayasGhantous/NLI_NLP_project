  you ca n't see that in the map . 
  why is every slovenian football match international ? 
  because they take corner kicks in neighbouring countries . 
  why did slovenia enter the eu ? 
  austria needed more parking space . 
  how do slovenians measure car acceleration ? 
  from 0 to border !, 
  why are n't there any disco clubs in ljubljana ? 
  austrians complained they were too loud . 
  why do slovens play accordion vertically ? 
  because if they played it horizontally , they would need passport . 
  slovenia 's sea is so big you can catch all the fish with a ping-pong net . 
  he 's not actually stabbing himself , sword is [ next to ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jbdeoyb.jpg ) his face , not in his face . 
  but that 's still one retarded looking lion . 
  i think it looks nice . 
  not as nice as ours , but nice . 
  yeah i guess it was . 
  sorry for yelling : /, 
  hey guys look this guy smokes weed, 
   catch the corrupt politicians too . 
  oh my god , how come they have n't already thought of that ?!, 
  if you do n't know which flair to use , you can use croatian one and then you can pretend that you 're croatian . 
  that 's what i do !, 
  typical irish . 
  i 'm the 4 % !, 
  i would n't call czech republic or hungary parts of eastern europe . 
  why ? 
  believe it or not , there is no mention of god or religion in croatian anthem either . 
  it 's a ok thing . 
  we are eu average !, 
  that 's good , right ? 
  and yet we can all agree that france , netherlands and uk are parts of western europe . 
  why ca n't we agree that czech republic is a part of central europe then ? 
  ** burn **, 
   there is no official version central or eastern europe is there official version western europe ? 
  and for one pope !, 
  i 'm not trying to let you down , but you have to take all things into consideration when planning a trip like this . 
  what makes you think you are going to find a job when there are n't many jobs available in most european countries ? 
  even if you find something available , are n't they most likely to employ someone who is from that place ? 
  that 's weird ... and kinda nice . 
  why on birthdays ? 
  [ onerepublic - counting stars ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht_nvwreihg ), 
  hey i talked to this german guy and got like 3 upvotes on those comments , so there 's that ... 
  [ oh i have another one ] ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8yofwc4ejm ) oh i just saw is kidding , i kid too :d, 
  germans . 
  i expected more from this thread . 
  it 's important ( or the main thing is ) that we understand each other . 
  that would be kaarmaa . 
  nope , it 's about karmaa . 
  yeah , that 's not really the same thing . 
  lol so funneh, 
  [ of course we do ] ( http://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/anglizam ), 
  oh , ok , i thought you were talking about posts , not comments . 
  i have one question for you . 
  why do you delete your comments after they get downvoted ? 
  i remember you doing it twice , once you bashed croatia and said that it was a poor country that eu does n't need and the second time you talked shit about serbia . 
  that 's only what i can remember . 
  it 's not really a problem in what you 're saying in those comments , but if you 're going to state your opinion you 're expected to argue it , not delete the comment because it 's downvoted . 
  ` nast\u0119pstwo ' sounds like croatian ` nasljedstvo ' which means ` heritage ' . 
  croatian word for ` step ' is ` korak ' , but you could also say ` stopa ' which sounds like ` stopie\u0144 ' , but that 's more like archaic form . 
  this is fun !, 
  ` secession ' would be ` odcjepljenje ' , i 'm not sure about ` succession ' , but google translate says ` slijed ' , ` naslje\u0111e ' or ` uzastopnost ' . 
  well they are n't common in croatia !, 
  we are special snowflakes . 
  it probably is n't , but it 's still a problem . 
  it 's also corrupt here but we managed to put our former prime minister in jail . 
  could n't they do that ? 
  yay !, 
  it 's time for weekly `` let 's talk shit about gypsies '' thread in / r/europe . 
  they were always allowed to return , this is their country as much as it is mine . 
  probably never . 
  it was ethnic cleansing according to them ... 
  yes it does . 
  but i thought gate sounded better than bridge , 
  the gate of the hell . 
  and that 's why you should always read the article !, 
  thanks . 
  why are there so few foreigners in poland ? 
  i always thought there were german and ukrainian minorities . 
  but why ? 
  meni se sere , a ne da mi se hodat do wc-a ... edit : jos se nisam posro, 
  our northern neigbours and very good friends !, 
  this is very nice , 
  i 'm curious , in which language is that map ? 
  alaska !, 
  edit : hawaii !, 
  i 've never heard that one . 
  oh , that makes sense, 
  also king petar kre\u0161imir iv ( croatia was never bigger than under his rule ), 
   zagreb is pretty ... boring i live in zagreb and i have to agree with you . 
  i think zagreb is nice place to live in , but it 's not really a tourist attraction . 
  i mean , there are some interesting things here like museum of broken relationships and the shortest railway in the world , but if i was tourist in croatia , i would go to some other places . 
  nice try , latvian minister of tourism . 
  sorry if this question sounds stupid , but what is exactly `` homosexual propaganda '' ? 
  that war was shameful only for serbia . 
  i 'm afraid of heights . 
  why is it such a big problem in russia ? 
  australia . 
  nobody gives a shit if you appreciate it or not . 
  ugh you again .
