  do you understand what ethnic cleansing means ? 
  there were crimes during and after the operation , and many of the commiters were punished by the croatian courts , but the operation itself was n't a crime . 
  oluja was n't an ethinc cleansing , even icty confirmed that . 
  the order for evacuation of civilians was given by the president of the so-called republic of serbian krajina and a convicted war criminal milan marti\u0107 before the croatian troops arrived . 
  the central celebration is today in knin , but yesterday there was a military parade in zagreb , the first in 20 years . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/velika-fotogalerija--vojni-mimohod-u-vukovarskoj-ulici/1394313/ ) 's a nice gallery from the parade . 
  very nice gallery !, 
  you called croatia the only openly fascist state in europe . 
  that 's a lie . 
  croatia was founded on principles of antifasicsm , do n't mix ndh with rh . 
  you took that tu\u0111man quote without context ; he was n't talking about civilians . 
  about that u at jasenovac , it only takes a couple of idiots to do that . 
  i still have to see a picture of that though , ca n't find it anywhere . 
  catholic priests can hold mass for literally anyone , including people like paveli\u0107 . 
  why someone ordered that mass , i do n't know . 
  there are some fascists in croatia , but not as much as you think . 
  same thing in serbia . 
  i really do n't see why you talking about bbb here , they are not the topic . 
  more lies and ad hominem attacks ... ca n't say i 'm surprised . 
  awesome, 
  what 's wrong with the football teams ? 
  kradem is right . 
  never thought i 'd say that . 
  why should n't he be in / r/europe ? 
  what happened to the black sea, 
  now there 's this awesome [ memorial ] ( http://imgur.com/ghyps4m ) of the red little car running over the tank . 
  found the cheater . 
   i think it is most fair to call him yugoslavian i agree , i 'm just saying that many people in croatia see him as a croatian writer because he was a croat . 
   if we are going to look at it formally both nikola tesla and ivo andri\u0107 were born in austro-hungarian empire true , but saying that tesla was born in croatia is n't any less true because he was born in [ kingdom of croatia-slavonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_croatia-slavonia ) which was a part of austria-hungary . 
  edit : actually , i was wrong , he was born in [ kingdom of croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_croatia_ ( habsburg ) ) . 
   formally he is considered a yugoslav or serbian writer . 
  perhaps in serbia , in croatia he 's considered a croatian writer . 
  kinda similar to how nikola tesla is considered a serbian scientist , despite being born in croatia and having worked in the us . 
  north brabant is rightfully croatian . 
  neither guiana or aruba are parts of europe ... 
  you can buy rakija ? 
  til we were removed from europe . 
  huh , you learn something new about your country every day . 
  they may deny that it was a genocide but they do n't deny that innocent people were murdered there in their name . 
  that 's why vu\u010di\u0107 came and it was a nice gesture that sadly was n't welcomed by the bosniaks . 
  embarrassing . 
  you 're wrong , look it up . 
  no country is claiming it . 
  i feel sorry for the cops having to deal with these pricks . 
  yes !, 
  i 've had it a couple of days ago on tkal\u010di\u0107eva , i think the place is called `` baza '' or something . 
  it 's not expensive in prague if you know where to look for it . 
  my fondest memory is having a dark kozel in the brewery in plzen . 
  i do n't know if kozel is considered a quality beer by czechs , but it was perfect for me . 
  it 's also terrible . 
  if you want cheap and great beer , go to czech republic . 
   new words like kolodvor . 
  i do n't understand why foreigners tend to call the language `` serbo-croatian '' , virtually nobody calls it like that here . 
  just call it what the native speakers call it , croatian and serbian , even if it is the same language . 
  what 's up with the catholics in eastern latvia ? 
  afaik all slavic languages are like that , it 's not complicated for the native speakers . 
  and you are lynching negroes, 
  he 's trolling , it 's pretty obvious lol, 
   i could go on forever ... 
  please do n't , you 're talking nonsense . 
  what war crimes are you talking about ? 
  you say above that number of murdered bosniaks in srebrenica is inflated and then you talk about 700000 serb victims in jasenovac ? 
   croato-muslim fascists . 
  i guess all those boys killed in srebrenica were fascists ? 
  you make me sick with your genocide apologism . 
  fuck that . 
  lol, 
  greeks , how will you vote ? 
  meh , could be worse, 
  seriously mods ? 
   what is against the rules of this subreddit ( all posts must be in english ) that 's not a rule , only a guideline . 
  he did n't say all muslims though . 
  i got the impression he was talking only about the terrorists . 
  how is he a racist ? 
  of course . 
  i already did that . 
  more likely than not having one . 
  the one who celebrates pays , others may give him a present or something, 
  croatian too . 
  there 's danube on the croatian border with serbia though . 
  / u/kotnik and / u/djubta are both serbs as far as i 'm aware . 
  another serbian troll . 
  shocking . 
  and one from vojvodina which is a part of serbia . 
  the title does n't say * all * balkan subreddits . 
   one says that his comment history is worse than he thought . 
  and that 's * after * he cleaned his history and deleted many of his most controversional comments . 
   that / r/europe is a subreddit open for everyone , as long as they 're civil i do n't consider him to be civil . 
  his posting of chetnik songs on / r/serbia , ustashi trolling on / r/croatia , making of a banner with war criminals responsible for thousand of deaths ( or allegedly responsible , right ? ), 
  is anything but civil . 
  his * opinions * are harmful and as such should n't be tolerated , especially not promoted and that 's what the mods did when they appointed him . 
   krademism my sides :d another one is his word for croatia : `` todoroslavia '', 
   why should anyone , crnaruka included , be prevented from being a mod solely based on their opinions , if their opinions are not interfering with their duties ? 
  you 're saying that / u/crnaruka could be a good mod and that 's probably true , he can remove posts that break the rules or even use css or automoderator to improve the subreddit . 
  however , he is also a genocide denier , a troll and a xenophobic asshole . 
  / r/europe is a multiethnic community . 
  what message do the mods send to the subscribers when they appoint such a man as a mod ? 
  they send a big fuck you to all the victims of the regime he celebrates and to all bosniaks and croats that are active on this subreddit . 
  i did n't express myself clearly ; i 'm not saying that they should be punished without a trial . 
  what i 'm saying is that we 're allowed to call them responsible for these crimes beacuse it 's obvious to every sane person that they * are * responsible .
