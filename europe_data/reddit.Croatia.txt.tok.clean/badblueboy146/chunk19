  you can find enough evidence on the internet , i do n't want to go into that right now because that 's not the topic . 
  stalin was also never sentenced , does that make him any less guilty of the crimes he commited ? 
  honestly i 'm a little surprised that you 're defending crnaruka . 
  i asked the mods yesterday if his removal was permanent , they ( one of them ) said that it 's most likely only temporary . 
   presumption of innocence is so fucking * pass\u00e9 * , amirite ? 
  in case of these guys , yes . 
  you guys are very stubborn , after all the complaints about / u/crnaruka you ignore them and re-appoint him as a mod ? 
  you are here to * serve * this community , not rule it . 
  i 'm very dissapointed with how you handled this situation and i 'm not the only one . 
  i do n't know if i want to be subscribed to this subreddit anymore . 
  thank you sweet baby jesus !, 
  it 's a nice little country with beautiful landscape and cool cities like ljubljana . 
  it also has some popular ski resorts . 
   is n't it a good moderator job to remove this stuff ? 
  most people do n't care so why let the frontpage be flooded by this stuff ... 
  the deleted post had over 600 points so , yes , people apparently * do * care . 
  i was talking about deleting threads and comments . 
  he created / r/srpska and put a banner on top of it with pictures of war criminals , he often posts ultranationalistic songs on / r/serbia , he got banned in / r/croatia for hate speech and obviously he 's a liar who says he 's serbian but never wrote anything longer than two simple sentences in serbian despite writing essays in english on / r/europe . 
  i 'm on mobile now so providing links is a bit complicated but if you want i 'll post them here tomorrow . 
  democratic , no . 
  transparent , yes . 
  croatia has the highest number of unesco intangible goods of any european country ( in a tie with spain ) . 
  in croatian it 's * vikend * . 
  if you do n't have a word , just borrow it from someone else !, 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_croatia_%28925\u20131102%29  in a letter sent by the pope john x tomislav is named `` king of the croats '' ( tamisclao , regi crouatorum ) . 
  what 's the subreddit ? 
  seriously . 
  either he 's a xenophobic asshole or a very dedicated troll . 
  moderator of a big subreddit like / r/europe should n't be any of those things . 
  terrible choice . 
  [ black hand ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_hand_%28serbia%29 ), 
  i do n't think monarchy is neccessary for people to identify with certain national symbols such as the flag , coat of arms , national anthem etc. 
  if you think about it , many countries that are often portrayed as having patriotic population ( russia , usa , all countries in the balkans etc ) are n't monarchies . 
  nice album , but i still like lithuania better . 
  congrats to the new mods !, 
  btw , how come you only recruited two mods , i think one of the mods told me that they 'll choose 3-6 new mods . 
  i 've always thought that it should be a rule that every country has to perform in its own language . 
  i 'd like to apply . 
   account age  1 year check  500 + combined karma from any subreddits check  be on reddit at least once per day to review the mod queue i can review the mod queue multiple times during day . 
   have experience as a moderator ( or similar ) i 'm a moderator of / r/croatia . 
  questions :  do you have any experience with automoderator ( / r/automoderator ) , css or the mod toolbox ( / r/toolbox ) ? 
  i do n't . 
   what timezone are you in , and when are you generally on reddit ? 
  cet , i 'm generally on reddit around noon and in the evening . 
   what is your favorite/least favorite thing about / r/europe favourite thing is the diversity ; being able to talk about certain topics that concern all europeans with people from all around the continent is awesome . 
  least favourite thing is the negative bias towards russia . 
   what could be implemented to make it better ? 
  about the russia thing , nothing . 
  you ca n't change the way people think . 
  what this subreddit could definitely use is more transparency from mods . 
  mods should interact with the subcribers and listen to their ideas to make the subreddit more enjoyable for everyone . 
   what would make you a good moderator ? 
  i can check and review the mod queue quite often to make sure nobody breaks the rules . 
  i 've been on this subreddit for over two years and i 'm familiar with the rules . 
  and istria . 
  zagreb has also got a bit touristy in the last couple of years . 
  the overcoat by gogol . 
  i like short stories . 
  bunch of fuckers , three policemen are confirmed dead and some media are reporting that there are civilian casualities, 
  how many mods are you going to recruit ? 
  unless you have von habsburgs on your throne . 
   todoroslavia i know you want to sound smart and edgy but that 's just stupid . 
  what is the right choice ? 
  so if someone likes putin he 's a bot ? 
  why ? 
  official languages are czech and english . 
  that area is often flooded because of its proximity to danube . 
  [ zagreb localpatriotic rap ] ( http://youtu.be/pilnj4atleg ) zgb yeahh, 
  this sub upvotes anything that has to do with gay people even if it 's obnoxious and intrusive like this post . 
  if you say anything contrary to the hivemind you 'll be called a bigot and properly downvoted as evidenced by your previous comment . 
  tolerance in action . 
  i did and i do n't see how they condradict what i 'm saying . 
  you said that \u010c and \u0106 are * variants * of c and that is wrong . 
  they are completely different letters with different phonetic values . 
   in south slavic languages there are more then two variants of c and g. um , no there are n't . 
  \u010c is a completely different phoneme that happen to be written in a similar way as c. same thing with \u0106 . 
  protestants are christians . 
  happy easter !, 
  am croatian , can confirm everything that / u/kradem says is absolutely true . 
  regardless of topic . 
  what are you talking about ? 
  makovnja\u010da is better, 
  easter has pagan roots but today it 's a christian holiday . 
  he probably meant wine . 
  easter is always on a sunday ... 
  yup , serbia uses it . 
  i plan on doing that too , marseille plays against psg tonight . 
  good thing tomorrow is also a holiday in croatia !, 
  orthodox christian churches use [ julian calendar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/julian_calendar ) . 
  their christmas is also different , on the 7th of january . 
  that 's not nearly the same . 
  russia was a dominant country in the ussr and russians were dominant in red army . 
  louisiana is n't dominant in the us . 
  or is it ? 
  who cares, 
   if this subreddit would really subscribe itself to foster integration , it should consider removing national flairs . 
  this subreddit should n't subscribe itself to anything , this subreddit is a community of many people who have different views on many topics . 
  if national flairs were banned here it would send a message that you 're not welcome to identify yourself as a german/british/croatian . 
  what about europeans who are not in the eu ? 
  they should n't have any flairs ?
