  this law is unacceptable . 
  their governmet apparently wants it . 
  hey , i [ also have one ] ( https://imgur.com/a/smyrt ) !, 
   btw , this is actually also a flag of europe , not just the eu . 
  i was planning on making you a mod , you know . 
  / r/serbia is full of xenophobes, 
  if belarus and china are the best examples you can think of then i believe you just proved my point . 
  of course it matters who 's in power , it 's just that americans have a different meaning of * centrist * which is economically more to the right than in europe . 
  that 's why their public expenditure is so low . 
  usa is not really a good country to compare european countries to though , because their bipartisan system is quite different from what we 're used to . 
   i would hardly call 50 's america centrist . 
  well , eisenhower was pretty moderate in domestic issues . 
  even as a conservative , he continued some practices of the new deal and expanded social security program . 
  it 's not absurd . 
  vast majority of times when a country experienced big economic growth , the party in power was centrist . 
  that 's not to say that every time a centrist party is in power a country will grow economically , but it has much better chances than with some radicals trying to fundamentally change the economy . 
  economic prosperity is always reached when mainstream centre-left or centre-right parties are in power , not with communists or fascists in power . 
  exactly . 
  we had an election here in croatia in november ( migrant crisis was very current at the time ) and i do n't remember a single word said about it in the pre-election campaigns . 
  it 's a non issue here , mainly because most parties agree on the solution to it - do whatever the fuck germany and austria are doing . 
  i got banned from there just know for posting [ this video ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndhtdl9a ) :d edit : unbanned now , 
  ** ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=uxkr4hspht8 ), 
  your president and pm both come from \u0160e\u0161elj 's party , do n't equate us with you . 
  i 'm not commenting on the verdict , but the fact that this xenophobic piece of shit is actually glorified in serbia , an eu candidate . 
  btw , hate speech is a crime but for some reason he was n't charged with it when he burned the croatian flag in belgrade . 
  here are some quotes of this guy to get you an idea of who the guy who is glorified in serbia ( / r/serbia too and apparently some serbs here ) actually is :  `` i hate the croats so much that i would have liked to gouge their eyes out with a rusty spoon . '' ( popular tv show minimaxovision in 1991 )  `` we 're not fascists . 
  we 're just chauvinists who hate croats . '', 
   `` i am being tried for atrocious war crimes that i allegedly committed through hate speech , while i was preaching the nationalist ideology of which i am proud . '', 
  november 2007 http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/seselj-s-most-memorable-quotes and maaany others ... a disgusting man . 
  very nice !, 
  i really like logos for sarajevo , good job !, 
  faroe islands it is then !, 
  only by americans and brits . 
  same here . 
  i traveled to bosnia with bus quite a few times and never experienced this . 
  well that 's a strange tradition . 
  too soon, 
  in general , yes . 
  there are many exceptions though . 
  only stem masterrace uses logic, 
  we already have georgia of europe , it 's georgia . 
  how about the word `` big '', 
  cogratulations !, 
  somewhat relevant : why are you the only country in europe which is not a member of council of europe ? 
  no , you 're not a member of the church if you 're not baptised . 
  straight outta molenbeek, 
  indeed . 
  completely different cases . 
  liberation of croatian territory , croatian army did n't expel anyone , serbs left voluntarily before the croatian troops even came to krajina and icty confirmed that . 
  i find it very believable . 
  false equivalence , gotovina did n't do the same thing as mladi\u0107 or karad\u017ei\u0107 , how misinformed do you have to be to claim that . 
  has it ever occurred to you that maybe , just * maybe * serbs committed more crimes ? 
  i 'm just pointing out your lie that no croat or bosniak has been indicted by icty . 
   you mean just how no bosnian , croatian or albanian war criminals were ever sentenced in hague ? 
  do n't lie . 
  what is your point ? 
  40 years not long enough for that bastard, 
  it 's human rights watch 's report . 
   according to the estimates of the government of serbia , at least 2,500 people , of whom 89 children , were killed during the attacks ( according to some sources , the total death toll was nearly 4,000 ) , while more than 12,500 people were wounded and injured . 
  sounds pretty bad so i decided to google it . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civilian_casualties_during_operation_allied_force  it reported that as few as 489 and as many as 528 yugoslav civilians were killed in the nato airstrikes . 
  [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] this is what i do n't get . 
  why inflate the numbers ? 
  is the real number of killed civilians not * high enough * ? 
  why not ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  indonesia is not a good example of a moderate muslim country , they even have sharia law applied in one of the provinces ( aceh ) . 
  here in croatia we have youth unemployment of around 50 % * countrywide * ( so in some places it 's higher ) but you do n't see us killing others with bombs and whatnot . 
  do you have a link to the live thread ? 
  there 's a [ song about a czech tourist in croatia ] ( https://youtube.com/watch?v=_jgboybnr5o ) . 
  ( it 's a parody song of a popular yugoslavian song done by croatian comedians ), 
  croatian coast is definitely not underrated , but the continental part of the country is . 
  if you 're into rural or health tourism , continental croatia offers that . 
  also , zagreb is a very nice city to visit . 
  it got more touristy in the last couple of years , but it 's still underrated when you compare it to cities like budapest and prague . 
  the city is beautiful during advent but there are also many street festivals during summer . 
  come to croatia , it 's close and beautiful . 
  i prefer stony beaches but there are also sandy beaches all over the coast if that 's what you 're into . 
  not again ... :(, 
  that 's fine but take every comment with a massive grain of salt . 
  reddit comments about balkans are usually terrible , do n't use them as a source of information . 
  read a few wikipedia articles on the wars and you 'll know more than some people who comment here that think they know everything . 
   we even elected a far right government no we did n't , stop spreding misinformation . 
  why pay for defense when america pays for everybody ? 
  they can easily redeploy if necessary . 
  the famous eurection . 
  this is maslenica bridge , not the pag one , 
   everybody in your class is sick . 
  there was a draft in the classroom !, 
  a small place near zurich . 
  not to be confused with baden-baden . 
  every place i visited in switzerland ( zurich , baden , luzern . . ), 
  of course . 
  you 're missing out . 
  how do you know it 's shitty before you hear it though ? 
  i 'm not the type of person who starts a conversation with a stranger , but strangers have started one with me numerous times and while there are some weird people , you will mostly meet interesting people with interesting stories . 
  just the other day , when i was smoking on a bench , an older man came to me and asked for a lighter . 
  i gave it to him and he just stayed with me and started talking . 
  at first i wanted him to go away , but when i really started to listen what he was saying i wanted him to stay . 
  he was pretty much telling me his life story , how he was a hockey player and a captain and the best scorer in history of a local club medve\u0161\u010dak ( they currently play in khl ) and then how he went to germany and started his business and then after many years came back to zagreb because that 's where he wants to spend the rest of his life . 
  when we parted ways , i googled his name and it was all true , there were interviews with him and it turned out that his father was one of the founders of my favourite football club ( dinamo ) .
