  becherovka on its own is also tasty , the one with lemon especially . 
  has anyone seen the new tv series * narcos * ? 
  is it any good ? 
  to what ? 
  wow , that 's horrible . 
  do turkish people feel safe anymore in their own country ? 
  thanks and good luck tonight !, 
   any taking out of context probably has some agenda as a cause - i just want to find out which one . 
   i ca n't get any answer from those domestic fucks because it always finishes with ad hominem on me \\ #justkrademthings, 
   on 8 october , the sabor decided to end relations with yugoslavia , [ 4 ] in the decision on the termination of the state and legal ties with other republics and provinces of yugoslavia . 
  [ 5 ] [ 6 ] that session was not held in the house of parliament but instead in the basement of an ina building , because of the possibility of the repeat of an incident such as the bombing of banski dvori . 
  [ 7 ] i was talking about this session . 
  ** this ** is why the holiday is ** today ** and not in ** may ** or ** june ** . 
  see , i can also bold random words to make myself look smarter . 
  shut the fuck up already , you 're embarrasing yourself , just like you did in / r/croatia . 
  what did i say wrong ? 
  it 's interesting that this parliament ( sabor ) session was n't held in the house of parliament , but in the basement of croatian oil company ( ina ) because of the fear of bombing . 
  the day before , on october 7 , the yugoslav air force bombed zagreb 's upper town where the seat of the croatian government ( banski dvori ) and sabor are located . 
  they hit banski dvori and one civillian died . 
  there are no leaves on the road in the back of the pic . 
  they are still white . 
  ... they are, 
  that 's chauvinism . 
  i ca n't believe you did n't pick me . 
  congrats to the new mods anyway !, 
  do you think evil puten will invade us after trump wins ? 
  you mean hillaryous, 
  why would serbia invade croatia, 
  thankfully i do n't have any american friends , 
  i want to see trump win , it would be hilarious . 
  edit : ahahahah they actually did it, 
  there 's no laissez-faire capitalism in europe , especially not in germany or norway . 
  the government often impose rules on businesses ( and it has every right to do so ) and people generally like it that way . 
  like you said , the government is the people . 
   who the fuck are you to cock block businesses like that the government . 
  capitalism 101, 
  / s as in / ** s ** rbija ??? 
  i do n't think so !, 
  people here like to repeat that this was originally a pagan tradition as if that somehow undermines the fact that now it 's a catholic holiday . 
  the same thing often happens on reddit during christmas or easter season . 
  well , now it 's christian . 
  the important thing is that we 're in a better place than serbia , what more do you need . 
  there is something called [ adriatic-baltic-black sea initiative ] ( http://predsjednica.hr/files/newsletter%20views%20and%20news_no%202.pdf ) . 
  do you fluently speak croatian too ? 
  you 're right , it was n't a genocide , only slavery . 
  that 's because nobody can reach belgium 's level of genociding . 
  wow this is like a balkan fight without swearing , keep it going boys !, 
  did you know that macroeconomists predicted 9 out of 5 last recessions ? 
  how can a country annex its own territory ? 
  btw croatia offered serbs autonomy later in the war ( z4 plan ) but they refused it . 
  edgy, 
  why not ? 
  it was changed . 
  we voted for the ban on gay marriage . 
   it is not legally possible to have a referendum about changing the constitution seriously ? 
  in croatia a referendum on constitutional changes ( which must be approved by the constitutional court ) is legally binding . 
  we had one of these a couple of years ago when we defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman . 
  thanks man , i also really enjoyed the thread , 
  wow , absolutely beautiful !, 
  to be fair , [ chetnik flag ] ( http://imgur.com/qj4zyuf ) looks like it was made by isis . 
  you 're right , but there are some of us who picked italian even in contitnental croatia because it 's , well , easier . 
  huh, 
  yup , it 's a [ church ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/crkva_sv._nikole_u_prahuljama_kod_nina ) . 
   do you really think that a person will flee the country of his birth , and leave his ancestral home and way of life , voluntarily to became a homeless refugee just because politicans tell them to ? 
  if this is actually what you believe , that is a really sad state of affairs . 
  do n't be so condescending , it 's rather annoying . 
  what was the croatian army supposed to do ? 
  the serbs rejected the proposed z-4 plan and they were n't ready for compromise . 
  the only viable option for ending the war in croatia was a military operation . 
  it was clear that the operation was imminent around the end of july in '95 so the leaders of the rsk * ordered the evacuation * . 
  republic of croatia can not be blamed for that , period . 
  unfortunately , there were crimes commited by individual members of the croatian army in operation storm , nobody 's denying that . 
  but what croatians can not accept as truth is that we sistematically cleansed our land from the serbs , that is simply not true . 
  after the verdict on gotovina and marka\u010d that is also legally confirmed . 
  serbs were ordered to leave by the leaders of the so-called republic od serbian krajina before the croatian army even liberated the territory , do n't play stupid . 
  except that oluja was n't ethnic cleansing , even hague confirmed it , or is that also another anti-serb conspiracy ? 
  any day now ... 
  i assume andere is andorra , good for them !, 
  yeah well do n't fucking wear one, 
  til people existed before rome, 
  so much ignorance in this thread , unbelievable . 
  political and economic uncertainty is status quo in croatia . 
  happy independence day makedonija !, 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hum,_croatia  hum is officially listed as the smallest town in the world . 
  on its western side , the town is enclosed by walls and on the remaining sides houses are built into the defensive walls . 
  it was first mentioned in documents dating from 1102 , at which time it was called cholm which is derived from the italian name colmo . 
  a bell and watch tower was built in 1552 as part of the town 's defenses beside the town loggia . 
  yup , they watched that hitchen 's documentary and took it as a fact even though he did n't even travel to india to explore things a bit . 
  he was just focusing on attacking her because of her religion . 
  everybody in india loves her , wonder why . 
  not true . 
  dispute what is wrtitten instead of who wrote it . 
  i phrased it wrongly ; * everyone * who is intersted in this stuff should educate themselves about stepinac , not only serbs . 
  stepinac had two options : stay in the position of power and try to do something good from there or get away from that position and let someone else ( who usta\u0161e would appoint ) take it . 
  he chose the first option and did [ a lot of good ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/kako-je-stepinac-spasavao-srbe-samo-1943.-godine-spasio-je-7000-srpske-sirocadi-s-kozare-i-3000-djece-partizana/174592/ ) . 
  serbs should really educate themselves about cardinal stepinac , catholic church did n't baptise him for no reason . 
  he saved many lives , mostly serbs but also jews and gypsies . 
  he was just trying to fabricate a claim on eastern srijem . 
  balkan is not a real peninsula . 
  trieste balkan confirmed,
