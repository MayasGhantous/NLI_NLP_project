  partisans executed a shit ton of civilians and pows . 
  youth day my ass , average age of those fucktards is around 90 . 
  great post !, 
  make texas mexico again, 
   you were just lucky enough to be born in europe , but that does n't give you a right to say ` fuck you , i got mine ' . 
  it kinda does . 
  he did not say that trump is n't a true christian , do n't put that in quotes . 
  he said that a person who only thinks about building walls can not be a true christian . 
   you uneducated backwardminded dumb fuck so tolerant !, 
  they did n't just criticise her for singing in emglish , but also because the lyrics and the music for the song was made by foreign compositors . 
  i mean , i do n't give a shit who wrote it , but they were n't mad just because it 's in english . 
  this could easily be in the top 5 this year . 
  you think that 's bad ? 
  when i met a french guy in france and told him i am from croatia he asked me if i was from moscow or st. petersburg ? 
  wtf ? 
  i love you and your beer \u2764, 
  catholic slav bros, 
   croatian ( serbian simplified ) wut, 
  according to the 2011 census 95,6 % of croatian citizens declared * croatian * as their mother tongue , while 0,07 % said it was * croato-serbian * and 0,18 % that it was * serbo-croatian * . 
   except for those of us who * do * call it '' * yugoslavian , serbocroatian , croatoserbian , south slavic * or any other name like that . `` only yugonostalgic people and people stuck in the past call it that and judging by your flair you 're one of those people . 
  luckily there are n't many of you . 
  i have some news for you buddy : yugoslavia is not coming back , deal with it . 
  it 's always a bit funny to me when people from around the world have strong opinions about this topic like it concerns them in any way how we call our language . 
  yes , it 's the same language and no , it will never be called * yugoslavian * , * serbocroatian * , * croatoserbian * , * south slavic * or any other name like that . 
  we call it croatian , they call it serbian . 
  end of story . 
  no it fucking would n't lol, 
  we miss you in / r/croatia, 
  you do n't eat with your asshole though, 
  what 's wrong with multilingual countries like canada or finland ? 
  indeed . 
  exactly , that 's why lawful verdict is n't always just . 
  justice and law are different things . 
  you 're joking , right ? 
  does n't matter , it is european, 
  the freedom to freely protest is one of the pillars of democracy . 
  very interesting interview , thanks for sharing . 
   agrokor , croatia 's largest private company and the biggest food producer and retailer in the balkans with some 60,000 employees , has struck a deal with six lenders led by russia 's sberbank and vtb to freeze repayments and get an unspecified cash injection . 
   agrokor 's debt , according to company data from last september , is 45 billion kuna ( $ 6.5 billion ) , or six times its equity . 
  a huge part of croatian economy depends on agrokor . 
  and now you 're allowing them here ? 
  what exactly is the eu supposed to do ? 
  topple an elected head of government ( soon head of state ) ? 
  that seems kinda counterproductive . 
  why stop at europe ? 
  is there / r/worldfederalists ? 
  it is definitely possible to make comments of certain users invisible to other users using automoderator . 
  taken out of context . 
  do you mean former ottoman province of greece ? 
  it must suck for the achitect to see his creation being destroyed like that . 
   the complex was designed by architect minoru yamasaki , who also designed the world trade center towers lol, 
  the walls are made out of concrete . 
  i agree , but what i 've heard from people who live or lived there , they say that while the building is ugly from the outside , the apartments are really nice , the view is awesome and they have everything they need in 100m diameter around the building . 
  it 's not legal in most european countries . 
  how is this even legal ? 
  he said balkans . 
  young liberal students, 
  and rightly so . 
  leaves fall off earlier here , 
  well it says it 's archaic . 
  you do n't ejaculate fertilized eggs . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_months  some names are derived from archaic croatian-slavic words that are no longer found in standard croatian dictionaries . 
  in some cases even the meaning of those words is ambiguous . 
  there is an explanation for every month in the article , for example o\u017eujak is * month of budding ( trees ) from the verb o\u017eujati * . 
  it 's the same for croatian . 
  no and no, 
  but when you write in english you should use dubrovnik . 
  what do you mean `` even the right wing party '' ? 
  nobody cares about women, 
  nah man , i 'm pretty sure it 's croatian ban napuljeon bonaparti\u0107 . 
   i do n't fucking care about my supposed serbian ancestry , croatia4lyfe . 
  he is . 
  it was still austrian empire when he was born , so no . 
  it could 've been serbs who posted them to provoke such reactions , who knows . 
  did she live in paris for a considerable amount of time ? 
  did she finish school there ? 
  oh my god, 
  you have \u0110okovi\u0107 but as a team i 'd say croatia is on par with serbia , if not better . 
  depends . 
  serbia is better at basketball and waterpolo ( but just barely ) and we are better at football ( tbh the only one that matters ) and handball . 
  of course serbian tesla has beard . 
  well you ca n't say they are n't getting creative , this is a step up from randomly scribbling swastikas or angular * u * s on the walls lol . 
  that 's easy , not simple . 
  is `` tsch '' [ this sound ] ( http://teflpedia.com/ipa_phoneme_/t\u0283/ ) ? 
  i might be wrong , i do n't speak geman . 
  `` tr '' is two sounds , `` tsch '' is one . 
  so now it 's church 's fault ? 
  what do they want now ? 
  can you post more context , not just one photo ? 
  neither is croatia apparently, 
  that 's why linolada  nutella . 
  seriously ? 
   do n't care much about the austrians/habsburgers which occupied their territories for centuries too . 
  i agree with the rest of your comment but i 'm not sure what are you talking about here . 
  claiming it never works is false , it works when used in the right time . 
  and i 've been waiting ever since !, 
  i mean come on , i 've been subscribed to this sub for 4 and a half years now , and what do i get in return ? 
  nothing . 
  even / r/serbia mistakenly made me a mod for a couple of hours ( that was a very fun day but a story for another time ) . 
  can i be a mod pls,
