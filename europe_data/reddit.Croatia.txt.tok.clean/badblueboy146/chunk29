  exactly !, 
  yup . 
  i studied italian for four years and all i can say in that language is \u00bf donde esta la biblioteca ? 
  latvia is best at women ? 
  well , it 's our sea , i do n't think we should just give it away for no reason . 
  also , koper is rijeka 's top competitor , it 's not in croatian interest to give that sea away . 
  yup , like nutella . 
  we get shitty nutella . 
  and we buy it because we obviously do n't care if we 're treated like shit . 
  you 're not an independent country . 
  croatia : http://www.total-croatia-news.com and https://eblnews.com, 
  the brexit process has n't even oficially started yet , it 's too early to make conclusions on its impact to the british economy . 
   the bad that religion brings far outweigh the good in my opinion really depends on the religion . 
  for instance , the good that [ the catholic church does ] ( http://www.caritas.org ) vastly outweigh the bad imo . 
   intolerance of introlerance is good , not bad . 
  very popular point of view , at least on reddit , but it 's overly simplistic . 
  who decides what 's intolerant ? 
  do you think every catholic is intolerant the same way you think every trump voter is racist ? 
  is n't that pretty bigoted and ignorant ? 
  you 're the one here who seems full of hatred . 
  he 's a serb living in slovenia . 
  croatia is centre/centre-right . 
  absolutely nothing . 
  new macedonia sounds pretty reasonable , it would be a good compromise . 
  very creative name !, 
   and it is known that was an ethnic cleansing how about instead of this `` it is known '' bullshit you actually provide some sources for your absurd claim ? 
  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/16/croatia-war-crime-analysis  because the appeal judges found that the shelling was not unlawful , they also concluded there was no planned deportation of the serbian minority and no `` joint criminal enterprise '' or political conspiracy by a leadership cold-bloodedly planning an ethnic pogrom . 
  so , the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia explicitly ruled that the operation storm was perfectly legal , why are you ignoring that fact ? 
  my street is full of flags . 
  there 's one building where they also put a couple of eu flags every holiday lol . 
   however , some have claimed that croatia 's lack of war crimes verdicts is somewhat compensated by that fact that the country 's courts have convicted people of committing murder and other crimes during the conflict . 
  the state attorney 's office told birn that it had initiated several thousand criminal cases after operation storm . 
  it said that it launched criminal procedures against 3,728 people for murder , violence , sexual crimes , theft and destruction of property . 
  of these , 2,380 people were convicted . 
   yes , but half the country were serbs . 
  and half of it were n't serbs . 
   it 's not like young bosnia was just serbs anyway . 
  it was mostly serbs , right ? 
  a-h did occupy bosnia , but bosnia was n't serbian land , it was ottoman . 
  i highly doubt that the catholics and muslims of bosnia preferred kingdom of serbia over austro-hungarian empire . 
  the last one is the only one that 's appropriate because it 's factual and nothing more . 
  i still do n't understand why serbs consider princip a hero , he murdered the only member of the habsburg family that actually wanted to change the structure of austria-hungary to accommodate the south slavs ( plus he murdered his innocent wife ) . 
  it was terrorism , not heroism . 
  this is the work of a french artist etien . 
  you can see more zagreb street murals [ here ] ( http://travelhonestly.com/zagreb-street-murals/ ) . 
  i 'm just kidding , i actually like the game itself , but i could n't watch the entire match due to commercials . 
  commercials can be very fun to watch , yeah . 
  a sport in which we beat you, 
  communism was also created by white people , is communism also white culture ?
