  fuckin non-slavs , ca n't even pronounce words properly amirite ? 
  idiots . 
  those who whistled , not the players . 
  yes , this is all about the territory . 
  we do it in our native languages . 
  nope , football . 
  i remember seeing it on a map on / r/mapporn , they ca n't be wrong . 
  [ united states dollar ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_dollar ), 
  maybe not a very funny one , but a joke nonetheless . 
  football is the most popular sport in russia , russia has never hosted the wc and it 's a great country to visit even without the world cup . 
  you focus only on bad things for some reason . 
  i 'm not planning to move to belarus if that 's what you 're saying . 
  i do n't live anywhere near russia . 
  nothing signiticant that would disrupt the world cup games . 
  they said that giving the wc to south africa was a bad idea because of the high crime rate there , pretty much nothing happened . 
  they said giving the euros to poland and ukraine was a bad idea because players would be racially abused there , almost no incidents . 
  they said giving the wc to brazil was a bad idea because there would be riots , nothing happened . 
  it sucks being gay in russia , but that 's not the reason they should not be allowed to host the wc . 
   i understand that russia is a bad place to host the world cup why ? 
  i hope that 's not going to happen . 
  i plan on going to russia if my country qualifies . 
  and downvote it . 
  this thread again ? 
  really ? 
  except there 's one little thing you 're both overlooking ... um what it 's called ... oh yeah , nato . 
  are you fucking serious, 
  in croatia too . 
  it has already been [ posted ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/2emptw/in_ukraine_an_armoured_column_appears_out_of/ ) on this sub . 
  this is probably the stupidest post i have ever seen on this sub , and i have seen a bunch of stupid posts here . 
  why would you downvote him ? 
  if only that was the case ... 
  / r/europecirclejerk, 
  not really . 
  are n't there some people in skane ? 
  europe * is * full of pussies . 
  you sound annoyed by this , 
  what are bread makers ? 
  the vast , overwhelming majority of russian population is in europe . 
  that 's what counts . 
  russia is much more european than turkey . 
  no offense mate but what you think is irrelevant . 
  russia is a european country . 
  not really , it 's surrounded by the european part of russia in the east . 
  you should know that ... 
  that would be awesome . 
   ukraine i 'd take . 
  it 's still in europe , more or less . 
  what do you mean , * more or less * ? 
  the entire country is in europe . 
  i still sometimes eat home baked bread ... 
  football , handball and basketball . 
  and we 're better in each of those than slovenia . 
  it should be ante paveli\u0107 . 
  sure , there are some idiots who think he 's a hero , but there 's no other man in the entire croatian history who has caused as much evil as him . 
  erdogan won the elections ... 
  easy for you to say when you have nice sexy borders, 
  it is your fault . 
  our borders looked so much nicer before the turks came ... 
  i understand it but the vast majority here does n't . 
  if you 're going to post an article here , post it in english or post a translated version of the article using google translate so everyone can understand it . 
  i would n't call prison comfortable , but yes . 
  that 's how it 's done in a civilised society . 
  i also used google translate and this is what the first pararaph says :  transnistria declared mobilization . 
  chapter tiraspol administration yevgeny shevchuk signed a decree calling all conscripts , reservists and employees of so-called state structures . 
  no mention of russian troops . 
  put them in prison for the rest of their lives . 
  russia ca n't do that . 
  transnistria does n't share a border with russia and is landlocked , and ukraine and romania would n't allow russian troops to pass through their territory . 
  anything in english ? 
  that 's not the problem . 
  that 's how it 's supposed to be . 
  signs he could n't read . 
  it 's called cyrillic / u/icannotjuggle !, 
  / u/kowakian explained it :  our educational system considers people who did n't finish elementary school as illiterate so , no , there 's no overlap . 
  oh shit , did * not * know this was illegal . 
  brb, 
  send it to ukraine, 
  are you serious ? 
  cyrillic is easier to learn obviously, 
  mladi\u0107 did nothing wrong amirite ? 
  fuck yeah cruise ships, 
  number two , actually . 
  good point . 
   my point being precisely that 's a terrible argument . 
  you ca n't or should n't decide what are long term politics based on current climate . 
  right . 
   that 's awfully primitive . 
  why do n't you move to a place where they still have clan wars ? 
  that seems to suit your preferences better . 
  why ? 
   right . 
  now * that 's * what i call a good argument !, 
  you ca n't say anything against this !, 
  i 've got no problem with being politically irrelevant . 
  omg how come nobody thought of this ?? 
  stromae is from belgium , no ? 
  worst joke ever, 
  i agree , we need to make room for more '' ______ of europe '' posts !, 
  haha thanks . 
  oh give me a break .
