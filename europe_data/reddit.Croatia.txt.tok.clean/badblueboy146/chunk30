  croatia is also constructing an lng terminal on island of krk . 
  mods remove posts and comments that break the rules . 
  why do you think we remove comments for having different opinions when the mods themselves often have different opinions about certain things ?

   is a word press blog , written by tha autor of rhe reaserch article , not an offitial un publication . 
  he has his sources listed , and you choose to ignore it because it does n't fit your narrative . 
  you just scream lie in the title like that 's some kind of an argument . 
  your discussion skills are non-existent . 
   serbian courts can prosicue war crime on the territory of exyu well , according to serbs they can . 
  republic of croatia would never extradite one of its citizens to a serbian court for such trial . 
   no you did n't http://www.un.org/en/index.html what about these websites ? 
  http://www.unhcr.org https://www.unicef.org http://en.unesco.org http://www.who.int/en/ are they also not the un ? 
  lol  tu\u0111am died before serbian courts could reach him hiding out in croatia . 
  he was n't hiding , he was the president . 
  why would even serbian courts put him on trial ? 
  the war was n't on the serbian territory , it was on croatian and bosnian . 
  that would be like croatian courts putting some serbs on trial for their crimes in kosovo , it does n't work like that . 
  that 's the jurisdiction of the international courts and they decided not to prosecute tu\u0111man . 
   can you provide a link to a un site with this documents ? 
  they put everything online these days and i 'd like to see the official document description . 
  i just did . 
   the united nations war crimes commission was a little-known united nations agency operating between 1943 and 1948 , with the goal of identifying , classifying , and assisting national governments with the trials of war criminals in the european and east asian theatres . 
  working in parallel to the more famous nuremberg and far east trial processes , it assisted with an unprecedented over 30,000 cases -- far more than nuremberg , un-supported , and international criminal court caseloads combined . 
  hitler was never prosecuted because he killed himself before he could be captured . 
  tu\u0111man did not kill himself , the internatonal community could have sent him on trial for his alleged war crimes if they wanted to and he could n't do anything about it . 
  i 'm not surprised you want to compare tu\u0111man with hitler though , i know you from / r/serbia . 
  if you read the article you would see that they list a source . 
  but reading is hard , i understand . 
  [ here ] ( http://www.unwcc.org/2017/06/05/hitler-in-the-charge-files-of-the-unwcc/ ) is your source with the documents themselves . 
  or is this also anti-nazi propaganda ? 
  you are not even trying . 
  did you even read the article or is your reading comprehension that terrible ? 
   the previous month the commission -- which began its work in 1943 , prior to the formal establishment of the un in 1945 -- determined hitler could be held criminally responsible for the acts of the nazis in occupied countries  and by march 1945 -- a month before hitler 's death -- `` the commission had endorsed at least seven separate indictments against him for war crimes . '', 
  was n't convicted of anything , was n't even on trial . 
  we have these in croatia ...

  it 's corrupted , we decided to pull out of the arbitration two years ago . 
  consensus is that the verdict is null and void . 
  i was mostly kidding , your reddit game is n't as strong as ours !, 
  point a is definitely too close to the croatian coast , it gives 3/4 of the bay to slovenes . 
  they argue that it 's their right to have direct access to open waters . 
  are you being sarcastic ? 
  i really ca n't tell if you think it 's ok what slovenes did but it is n't ok that they were caught ? 
  keep it , do n't steal ours . 
  either people are uninformed or slovenes are downvoting .

  well that was my point , it should n't be included on this map just because it 's called a country and not a region by the uk . 
  i 'm sure scotland was independent once , but you decided not to be independent again when you voted to stay in the uk . 
  scotland is not a member of the un , it does n't have its embassies anywhere , no independent foreign policy and it 's not recognized as an independent country by anyone . 
  your internal divisions are irrelevant in this context , scotland being recognized as a country by uk does n't make it an internationally recognized country . 
  well if the map maker decided to include the scottish subreddit he would also have to include subreddits of all autonomous regions in europe .
