  this metric includes immigration and as such it has everything to do with economy . 
  communism made our countries economically worse off than western europe . 
  now that some of ex-communist or socialist countries are in the eu , nothing stops people from emmigrating to those richer countries in the west . 
  so yeah , fuck communism . 
  hate speech against anyone is absolutely not ok and will be removed every time we see it . 
  however , not everything you see as hate speech is considered hate speech by us . 
  on the other hand , personal attacks like the one you wrote above are never ok and will always be removed .

  tijelovo in croatian . 
  pentecost - 50 days after easter . 
  easter is on a different date every year beause it has to be on sunday , so every other holiday that 's calculated from easter is also on the different date every year . 
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corpus_christi_ ( feast )  the feast of corpus christi ( latin for `` body of christ '' ) is the roman rite liturgical solemnity celebrating the reality of the body and blood of jesus christ son of god in the eucharist . 
  it emphasizes the joy of the institution of the eucharist . 
  the feast is liturgically celebrated on the thursday after trinity sunday or , `` where the solemnity of the most holy body and blood of christ is not a holy day of obligation , it is assigned to the sunday after the most holy trinity as its proper day '' . 
  [ apparently not . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/public_holidays_in_vatican_city ), 
  in which parts of spain is it a public holiday ? 
  i used information from [ this wikipedia article ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/corpus_christi_ ( feast ) ) which also includes bosnia and herzegovina but i found a list of their public holidays and this feast was n't on it .
