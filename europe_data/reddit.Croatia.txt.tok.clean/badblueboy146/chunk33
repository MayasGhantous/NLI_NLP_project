   hopefully the political `` promotion '' ( read : lots of poo flinging ) will calm down soon . 
  i doubt it , at least in zagreb it will not calm down . 
  the second round is in two weeks , right ? 
  so that 's another two weeks of poo flinging .

  we already de facto have a multi-speed eu . 
  you should also refrain from leaving comments like this one , consider yourself warned . 
  pretty much . 
  the european community can be given credit for a lot of things regarding keeping peace on the continent , but they failed so miserably in the yugoslav wars that the americans had to intervene . 
  this is a common misconception among people from coastal croatia ; if croatian tourism took a major hit , people from istria and dalmatia would suffer the most , not people from continental croatia . 
  blaming everything on zagreb is a traditional pastime in dalmatia but it has no basis in reality .

  * khm *,

  wait , does the hosting tv station cover everything ? 
  what 's the point of ecbu then ? 
  his whole left side was kinda modern or something idk , his right was a tuxedo, 
  we will win, 
  i see disco is alive and well in san marino, 
  the only question you never ask in eurovison is `` why '', 
  ireland can you be any more boring ? 
  second best boobs this year after the polish girl . 
  the song is too disneyish but his voice is the best one this year imo . 
  not to mention that religious people can also be in favor of multiculturalism and immigration . 
  as a catholic , it 's more compatible with my faith to support peaceful coexistence than closing our borders .

  thanks !, 
  can you give a tldr ? 
  that was the inspiration according to the guy who designed it , but it 's not what it symbolises today . 
  nah , his name was nikola tesla and he was born in croatia . 
  wait ... 
  exactly , pr teams of european institutions could be a lot better . 
  i also blame local journalists for not giving european events enough exposure and not reporting what 's going on in bruxelles and strasbourg . 
  yes , i wish we had more such manifestations troughout europe so that people really feel that their country is a part of something bigger . 
  very nice , we had a similar thing in zagreb on the european square last year , every country had a stand where they offered local specialities . 
  lol ukraine , travanj is april , not may,

  on one hand i want more people to know about croatia so we can attract more tourists and get more monies , but on the other hand i do n't like crowded beaches in the summer . 
  habsburg dinasty best dinasty 1527 best year of my life bring monarchy back on a more serious note , austria is economically essential to croatia , it 's one of the biggest trading partners , many of its banks are present here , many tourists come from austria and many croats go skiing there .

  if the french intelligence agency was attacked on bora-bora , that would be news . 
  russia counts as a european country so even though this did n't happen in geographic europe , it can be posted here . 
  well russia is in europe . 
  i 'm just saying orban is not the only * european * leader to congratulate him . 
  neither are we in britain , write however the fuck you want . 
  putin also congratulated him . 
  yup , there were celebrations there on sunday when the referendum passed . 
  they also like to cheer for turkish national football team when they play against croatia . 
  perhaps bosniaks . 
  no isis in croatia though !, 
  i know you 're joking but i 've never understood the mental gymnastics behind this belief that is popular among serbs . 
  we never were orthodox ( there was n't even such thing when neither we or serbs converted to christianity ) , we have always been under vatican influence , not byzantine . 
  we 're like that . 
  the world 's biggest tie was proudly presented in [ pula ] ( https://imgur.com/a/rb9i9 ) a couple of years ago . 
  there 's something beautiful about catholic mass , especially on easter and * especially * in old churches and ** especially ** if it 's in latin .
