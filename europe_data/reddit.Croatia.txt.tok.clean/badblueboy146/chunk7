  haha , that 's an odd choice of words . 
  i 'll translate it in case anyone is interested in what they mean . 
  no , not really . 
  * rt * - it means * cape *, 
  it 's still blue . 
  well it 's still happening, 
  maybe he 's a porn star . 
  aww, 
  hercegovci do n't care huh ?

  i 'm croatian and ca n't pronounce * r * properly . 
  i pronounce it like you guys i think . 
  exactly !, 
  fuck the croats !, 
  yeah ok but it still took you more than three weeks , i would 've done it in three days, 
  well that was quick edit : wtf there 's nobody from kazakhstan on this sub ? 
  never believe a serb . 
  wtf does socialism have with this ? 
  bbb ai n't no joke buraz, 
  lol slovenia has regions, 
  stalin did it intentionally . 
  our national football federation president 's greediness is the reason we 're not in fifa , we did qualify . 
  dude wtf, 
  hey fuck you ok ? 
  i 'm not sure but i think it 's croatia . 
  have you ever been in syria ? 
  i think this thread wo n't take off, 
  yea fuck the uk it should all be about croatia, 
  how close are you to him ? 
  oh come on , just because you do n't agree with him does n't mean he 's a troll . 
  good luck serbia !, 
  we have the same thing in croatian , you are not that special :p, 
  yeah but many european languages have 2 words for the same thing , not only english . 
  ca n't argue with that !, 
  hey man do n't be jealous, 
  i found a girlfriend . 
  lol no kosovo stronk independent country who dont need no serbia, 
  but they were not autonomous regions in yugoslavia . 
  needs more colours , he should add kosovo and vojvodina . 
  / r/windowshots might also help you , 
  if you surrendered , you should n't be killed . 
  regardless of if you were fascist or not . 
  yeah ok , all people killed by him were war criminals , right ? 
   it should be illegal in every western democracy . 
  why ? 
  why not both ? 
  but you can kill thousands of innocent people . 
  we are at something like 53 % , right ? 
  . . in what way was he a hero ? 
   at least it apparently recognizes some kind of limited partnership . 
  nope , not yet . 
  croatia did that last month . 
  english is much more important than german or french . 
  me too , it was qbasic . 
  he has obviously never watched cobra 11 . 
  well ... it 's not really doing well , we are on top of the table ( for the 8th season in a row ) but it 's very complicated situation regarding dinamo here ... our league sucks , the chairman is the biggest asshole in croatia ( ** everybody ** hates him ) , national football federation is corruped ... the only good thing in croatian football is our national team . 
  i was joking too < 3, 
  omg racism !, 
   i think it 's fairer to say that you need n't downvote that which you do n't agree with i agree , but since this post is a question i think it 's fair to upvote comments that answer the question , no matter what they say . 
  of course , you * do n't have * to do that , but i do n't think all of those who upvoted comments that are kinda eurosceptic agree with them . 
   i do n't get why this is being upvoted so much . 
  because you should n't only upvote things you agree with , that 's stupid . 
  i would . 
  or swedes . 
  vienna definitely !, 
  immigrants are ok . 
  within the schengen area * there are still border checks between slovenia and croatia , for example , and they are both in the eu . 
  i want to visit all three countries you mentioned . 
  black tomislav is probably my favourite croatian beer , although it 's not very popular . 
  i was pretty surprised to see it here honestly . 
  fuck them too . 
  ( happy new year ! ), 
  who said this was eu ? 
   we know that god does n't live in the sky and that it 's impossible for him to live there . 
  if you knew anything about christianity , you would know that christians do n't believe that god literally lives in the sky , sky is just a synonym for heaven . 
   i can see you have no other arguments to add , so i 'll call it a night . 
   would n't you consider delusional somebody that believes , * actually * believes , that there are unicorns and dinosaurs on jupiter ? 
  yes , i would , because we know that they do n't live there and that it 's impossible for them to live there , whilist we do n't know if god exist . 
  you ca n't seriously think that believing in god is the same as believing in space unicorns . 
   not beliving in god is logical . 
  i think believing in some kind of higher force is logical . 
  if you want to call it god , so be it , i do n't think that 's illogical . 
  and it does n't make you stupid . 
   there 's a study that showed that atheist people are generally more emphatic , they donate more blood , they 're willing to help people more . 
  if there was a study that showed that french are generally more emphatic , they donate more blood , they 're willing to help people more than germans , would you think less of germans ? 
   a person can have actual faith only in 2 cases . 
   a ) he 's stupid . 
  b ) he 's delusional . 
  i do n't really want to talk about god and his existance , but i think that person does n't have to be stupid or delusional to believe in some kind of higher force . 
  nobody knows for sure if god exists , including you . 
  do you think that believing in god is more delusional that not believing in him ? 
  i do n't think any of those options are delusional . 
  if you 're a christian , that 's does n't make you delusional and it certainly does n't make you stupid . 
   what i require for respect is my business completely , and while in some cases , if the person shows other great qualities , i might respect them , i do n't like dumb people i agree with you here , respect is a very subjective thing . 
  i do n't lose respect for people based on their religious beliefs , like you , because i think that 's a bad thing . 
  we should n't judge people based on just one thing , like their race , sexuallity or ** religion ** . 
   tolerance is a good thing - let 's tolerate terrorism then . 
  oh wait , it 's not always a good thing , now is it . 
  of course it 's not always a good thing , but when it comes to religion , i think it is . 
  religion is not equal to terrorism .
