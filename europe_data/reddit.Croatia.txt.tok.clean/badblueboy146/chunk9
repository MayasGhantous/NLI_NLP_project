  good for you moldova , i think this is the first step in the right direction . 
  that 's true , if you do n't believe it just google it . 
  i 'm a bad boy . 
  there are at least three ohios on your map . 
  i think it 's pretty spot on . 
  does n't ignorant mean `` who does n't know '' , not `` who does n't want to know '' ? 
  i 'm ignorant on this subject so i could be wrong . 
  what do you mean ? 
  we qualified for the world cup !, 
  yeah fuck czech republic . 
  jesus christ , this is really terrible . 
  i hope number of casualities stops rising . 
  well good for you , but people sometimes want to discuss certain topics in a serious matter , you do n't have to joke about everything . 
  if you only want to joke , you already have polandball . 
  what about football ? 
  russians are awesome , at least those i met . 
  / r/bulgariaball, 
  it reminds me of civ . 
  gary lineker said `` football is a simple game ; 22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end , the germans always win '' , but we beat them two times . 
  it 's only celebrated in northern croatia . 
  not really . 
  how come russia is yellow , but belarus is n't ? 
  it 's catchy , but not really for a football song . 
  where is that ? 
   nothing will change for the people of the right sexual orientation who have had the right to marry since always . 
  actually , things will probably change for them ( edit : i meant to say things will change for gay people ) , croatia will probably legalise same-sex civil unions , but they wo n't be called marriages , and i 'm perferctly okay with that . 
  i was just saying that nothing regarding * marriage * will change , i should have made that clear . 
   on the other hand , if nothing will change ( as you said it ) , then why even bother with the whole referendum ? 
  i do n't know , i think this referendum is stupid . 
  as i said , it 's already written in croatian law that marriage is a union between man and woman . 
  why would we recognise them ? 
  this referendum is only about puting one sentence in the constitution that marriage is between man and a woman , that 's already stated in the croatian family law so nothing will change . 
  / r/europics, 
  i heard that cigarettes in ireland are the most expensive in the whole europe , is that true ? 
  but they are all different . 
  he hides in / r/serbia and comes to / r/europe very rarely , but when he comes , he comments 100 times in one thread . 
  well , we 'll form an alliaince with swedes !, 
  how do you like * that * ? 
  like we do n't . 
  not for croatia either . 
  as long as we are above serbs i 'm okay with that . 
  of course it does . 
  shut up china, 
  he read it somewhere obviously . 
  this post was inspired by [ my comment ] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1q10ng/sign_written_in_two_official_languages_of_finland/cd84scl ) , admit it !, 
  it 's the serbs , man ... 
  did n't you see that i put smiley there :  in croatian , bosnian and serbian language ( in that order ** :p ** ) that means it was a joke !, 
  90 % for me , did n't know the answer to the last two questions . 
  somewhat relevant : [ pack of cigarettes is bosnia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/rk6fdlu.jpg ) , it says `` smoking kills '' in croatian , bosnian and serbian language ( in that order :p ) . 
  yes . 
  did not expect to see bulgaria and romania in positive numbers . 
  fuck you greece, 
  til we know nothing about south sudan . 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/south_sudan  a december 18 , 2012 report on religion and public life by the respected pew research center states that in 2010 , 60.5 % of south sudan 's population was christian , 32.9 % were followers of traditional african religion and 6.2 % were muslim . 
  but that 's not 100 % correct if i understood that wikipedia article correctly . 
  ... short . 
  so probably a christian . 
  what a surprise , he 's not a muslim !, 
  why would n't it be ? 
   the suspect , said to be in his 50s ** and of foreign origin ** , has been arrested, 
  do n't jump to conclusions yet . 
  yes of course , i know that . 
  spanish is hard , okay ? 
  that 's not short . 
  are n't anthems supposed to be old-fashioned ? 
   these desecrations happened after the war , when things were still tense , like a decade ago . 
  now things are calm , and no one gives a shit . 
  apparently that 's not true . 
  why is there an accent on croatian and bosnian `` ja '' ? 
  good for you . 
  haha calm down i was joking, 
  hey !, 
  some europeans are very sensitive about their wine , okay ? 
  we drink just as much here , but we drink rakija , wine is for pussies . 
  yeah ireland what the fuck, 
  just so you guys know i ate that yesterday . 
  i think corruption is a better word . 
  turks are n't arab . 
  you guys are european average , that 's * good * . 
  he thinks things are ok . 
  racism , as well as xenophobia , homophobia and other forms of bigotry will not be tolerated . 
  how will you decide what is racism and what is n't ? 
  people here throw `` that 's racist '' argument a lot , even when the person they are disagreeing with said nothing remotely racist . 
  yeah right , next thing you 're gon na tell me is that greenland is smaller than australia, 
   corsica is smaller than cyprus whaaat, 
  fuck yeah communism, 
  are n't we badass ? 
  no , i just do n't see myself living in anywhere else but croatia . 
  i 'd like to travel around the world and see many countries , but i will always want to come back here . 
   unless you did n't do something he did n't like , or belong to the thousands of people he had murdered . . yup , he ( indirectly ) killed * many * innocent people , but people here seem forget about that , because , well , he was better than stalin or hitler right ? 
  i do n't even understand that logic . 
   wtf - good thing it was overturned . 
  i do n't see why we should honour dictators really , at all . 
  in croatia it was n't overturned . 
  one of the squares in the centre of zagreb holds his name . 
  i agree that he is part of our history , but we should n't honour him in any way . 
  they participate in the eurosong , * duh * . 
  hey kazakhstan is my favourite country !, 
  it would be cool if vara\u017edin was the capital today though , 
  maybe i do too ...
