my point is that 1 anonymous person sharing an obscure misinformation which even if true would be irrelevant is insignificant . 
  nobody in croatia is claiming that tesla was a croat . 
  there is n't even a discussion about it . 
  i only found about this `` controversy '' when i started using the internet . 
  most croats do n't have a problem accepting that tesla was a serb ( most of us do n't even care ) , but most serbs seem to have a problem accepting where exactly was he born . 
  hearing how those lands were part of croatia even in 19th century just does n't fit with your political views . 
  oh , and others who contribute to this kinds of discussions are just doing it for the `` balkan '' memes . 
  so we need a thread like this , with hundreds of comments , every few weeks , to correct an obscure , historically inaccurate and utterly irrelevant claim that tesla 's great-grandfather might have been catholic ?? 
  one guy says tesla 's great-grandfather ( lol ) might have been croat , and 100 serbs immediately get triggered . 
  what was ? 
  can you say it ? 
  no , they do n't . 
  but some people do have a problem admitting croatia existed back then , so instead they keep mentioning austrian empire which i find hilarious . 
  you 're oversimplfying things . 
  if religion is the only thing seperating all these people then how do you explain that croats and slovenes are different ethnicities ? 
  yes , `` just '' religion and mentality and history . 
  as if we also need to be different colours on top of that to justify separate ethnicities . 
  almost all europeans look the same unless you compare people on the oposite sides of the continent ( like portugal and finland or ireland and greece ) , but even then you can never know for sure when looking at individuals . 
  if you placed a bunch of croats , serbs and albanians in separate groups you could make an educated guess based on prevalence of certain phenotypes . 
  you could also guess from which part of croatia someone is ; for example , southerners are considerably taller . 
  but none of this is particularly important because we europeans have traditionally discriminated each other over religion , politics , ethnicity or languge , not so much over appearance . 
  you left out some important details , like that chocolates were given on the aniversary of serbia 's attack on dubrovnik and that croatian president is sponsoring a campaign `` buy croatian [ products ] '' ( `` kupujmo hrvatsko '' ) and when later asked why did she gave serbian chocolate to children she said she was not aware of it and that she always promotes croatian products ( as a president should , duh ) and that mistake like this will not happen again . 
  croatian `` journalists '' picked up this story and went full retard with it . 
  never happened . 
  you need new glasses . 
  almost every word in polish has at least one letter `` w '' . 
   might not be hes song , but he plays it frequently i do n't follow thompson or his music , so can you tell me when were the last few times he performed that song ? 
   it 's accepted that the flag with the white squares first is an ustasha one , thats why modern croatia has the red starting one . 
  no , it 's not accepted . 
  you 're talking utter nonsense , as usual . 
  the video ends while they 're still playing so i think the cameraman could n't take it any more . 
   anyway , it does n't have to be called serbian or croatian , or even serbo-croatian , it can be called yugoslavian or balkanic or something . 
  everyone is just fine accepting that croatian and serbian are both south slavic languages . 
  if you want to add another classification and call it central south slavic while calling bulgarian eastern slavic and slovenina western slavic that would also be fine . 
  but it would n't change anything , you would still have a croatian standard being developed independently and in 50 years you would have the same situation as is today with norwegian and danish . 
  i 'm not familiar with the law in this case so you might be correct . 
  most everyday products here in croatia are also intended for markets in bosnia and serbia and they regularly use the same text for multiple languages and sometimes separating different words with a '' / '' . 
  and what 's the difference between croats and slovenes ? 
  hint : it 's not religion . 
  this is incorrect for croatian . 
  we use `` ispri\u010davam se '' or `` oprostite '' . 
  you 're the one missing the point . 
  the way this situation is usually solved is to write the text once and then just mark it as 2 or 3 languages . 
  whoever made this label intended it a joke , a way to present an absurdity that can `` only happen in the balkans '' . 
  it 's a tired old joke , and it 's stupid because the same situation exists in scandinavia and nobody is making a big deal out of it and then typing comments like `` welcome to scandinavia '' .

  no , this is what we call a joke , made by someone who does n't believe bosnian , croatian and serbian are different languages . 
  the way this is usually handled is by writing the text once ( if it 's indentical ) and adding languages for which it applies : http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3dhilxg3pyg/vwnk7ma5odi/aaaaaaaacbi/gd9fwybcijq/s1600/dscn3238.jpg the same is done with scandinavian languages : http://blog.jensen-localization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/label-palmolive.png http://blog.jensen-localization.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/label-nivea.png, 
  it was 28.3 \u00b0 at 04:00 in zagreb tonight . 
  you said : `` there would be no war if we did n't want one '' when tudjman actually said : yes , there would be no war if had given up and allowed serbia to run us over . 
  tudjman was mocking those who said that croatia was also responsible for the war . 
  how in god 's name can you interpret this as `` croatia wanted war '' ??? 
  ffs !, 
  [ it feels like i 'm playing chess with a pigeon . 
  ] ( http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pigeon%20chess ), 
  that 's a bold faced lie . 
  rata , da smo i mi krivi za rat . 
  tldr : he said croatia wanted to avoid war and was ready to compromise but they ( serbs ) refused . 
  he said that indeed there would be no war if croatia had just given up and allowed serbia to do whatever it wants . 
  [ 21st kordun corps surrendered near topusko after being completely surrounded by croatian army . 
  civilians were mixed with soldiers , some 1500 of them . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/c1ooyapkihe ) still , no srebrenica happened . 
  [ few months earlier thousands of serbs were captured near pakrac . 
  civilians were immediately returned to their homes and captured soldiers were released the next day . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/w5ltgoxs7cw?t=52s ) again , no srebrenica . 
  not even close . 
   ` nogomet ' is most certainly not a newly coined word characteristic for the 1990s era . 
  here you can see it being used in a news article from 1913 . 
  btw , look up the russian word for a helicopter . 
  he has no idea what he 's talking about . 
  croatian has always favored slavic words and constructs and it 's not our problem that our south-eastern neighbors have other ideas about development of their languages . 
  [ like scandinavians ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/north_germanic_languages#language_boundaries ), 
  if it was up to europe we would probably still be fighting . 
  they failed to prevent the war and maybe even helped it to start by sending mixed messages about recognition of new countries . 
  they imposed weapons embargo when one side had all the weapons and everyone else had bare hands . 
  they kept proposing peace deals that included dividing bosnia based on areas that were captured by force and cleansed . 
  they sabotaged croatian and bosniak attempts at liberating their countries . 
  they opposed the use of air strikes against the serbs . 
  they opposed deploying european soldiers . 
  instead of stopping the war they all used it for their gain , with british being the apsolute worse . 
  read carol hodge 's britain and the balkans . 
  hahahahahahaha, 
  europe fucked up . 
  usa actually accomplished something . 
  and what nationality should an author be ? 
  english , french , canadian ? 
  you really think that they 're not biased ? 
  the book in question is heavily sourced and tries to give an objective explanation on why society acts the way it does . 
  read [ `` heavenly serbia : from myth to genocide '' ] ( http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1912684.heavenly_serbia ), 
   international conventions guarantee access to open sea so you ca n't box a country in by building a bridge . 
  it has to meet certain minimal height and distance between spans to allow ships to go through . 
  that 's reasonable . 
  but what 's not reasonable is demanding a bridge with dimensions comparable to bridges spanning the bosphorus strait !, 
  what are you even talking about ? 
  nobody 's denying you anything . 
   there are those who say bosnia should get a corridor through the croatian sea to the international waters . 
  lol !, 
  take a number !, 
  omg , what is that `` music '' ?
