   as we speak the immigrants are being transported by train to a hungarian border ( botovo , via koprivnica ) , confirmed information by ministry of internal affairs . 
  i was talking about the ones from last night . 
  it was pretty obvious from milanovi\u0107 's presser that the government took a more aggressive stance today . 
  rightfully so, 
   it 's not true , last report from slovenian media are saying that you are transporting refugees to hungerian border the government is n't ...  why refugees get paper in srbo-croatian languange that they have to leave the country and then they are left alone 1 . 
  `` serbo-croatian language '' does not exist 2 . that 's the law  that 's why they are allowing this you ca n't lock people in camps ... 
   but then please expain me , what is the protocol if the refugee do not to apply for asylum they have 30 days to leave the country or will be forcefully deported . 
  anyone who helps them in any way after those 30 days also breaks the law  maybe you have to help them transport to you neighbourly country unlike our neighbours ( hungary and serbia ) , the croatian government has n't been doing that . 
  the migrants who appeared at the croatian-slovenian border went their on their own . 
  enough is enough , though, 
  too many people . 
  serbia is basically dumping them on our border so our government stopped caring , slowed down the influx , and will dump them all on slovenia and hungary, 
   they do not want to do anything with them and they are redirecting them to slovenian and hungary border that was actually the plan since day 1 . 
  nothing has changed . 
  milanovi\u0107 was pretty clear about helping them get to germany the entire time, 
   i do n't know why the excessive hostility towards hungary * `` hungary is n't talking to croatia at the moment . 
  even before the refugee wave , hungary-croatia relations were on a low level and i do n't see a reason to hold any kind of talks before the general election '' * hungarians are pissed off because heads of their national oil company bribed our ex-prime minister to sell them the controlling interest in our oil company , and the current government ( rightly ) want that deal reversed . 
  the orban boyz are waiting for hdz ( the party that was lead by said prime minister before he got arrested ) to win the election because they 're known for corruption and `` germany 's lapdog '' politics - it 's easier to strike a favourable deal with a willing accomplice, 
   ^ this * `` le vote \u017divi zid xb '' * tier post, 
   that is some harsh language right there our pm is not your typical milk-and-water social democrat  he is calling out merkel personally ? 
  yep, 
   what degree you 're insulted or offended by these migrants saying your country is not good enough i 'm not insulted at all, 
  * `` croatia ** can not and will not carry this burden ** . 
  we wo n't register people any more . 
  we 'll give them water , something to eat , a place to stay over night and send them on their way '' * `` we 're sending a message to the european union that ** croatia wo n't be a `` hot spot '' ** , as bureaucrats who earn $ 10000 a month say . 
  croatia will not host a hundred thousand refugees for europe to cherry-pick '' * `` i find ** german policy ** generous and good , but also ** inviting ** . 
  ** merkel said that the dublin is n't enforced any more ... ** '' * '' ** angela merkel invited people over ** and they 're in a rush to get there '' * `` it 's possible , allowed , and humane for ** greece to start abiding by the rules ** and stop the influx . 
  why are they not doing that ? 
  why is europe letting that happen ? '', 
  * `` asked to comment on the ** threats ** coming from serbia , milanovi\u0107 said '' ** an eagle does n't catch flies ** . 
  we are the eagle . ' '', 
  * `` asked ** what would happen if hungary sent its army ** to the croatian-hungarian border , milanovi\u0107 said `` i 'd like to see that happen '' * `` the ** issue is complex ** and starts hundreds of miles south of croatia - it was ** caused by the incompetence of the eu ** to solve what had to be solved ages ago - the issue of the border between turkey and greece . '', 
  damn autocorrect * `` so far 13500 migrants have entered croatia , which is a record in such a short time , but everything is under control and the nation can handle it '' , said the first deputy prime minister and minister of foreign and european affairs vesna pusi\u0107 , adding that `` out all of those only one woman claimed asylum for herself and her children '' *, 
   where does your country stand on freedom of speech ? 
  `` it 's forbidden and punishable by law incite war , use of violence , national , racial or religious hatred , and any other kind of intolerance ''  do you thinks it 's a fair position ? 
  yes  are you envious of other nations that have more or less freedom of speech ? 
  not at all  what is a sensible amount of protected speech to allow ? 
  i think croatia got it right . 
  it 's okay to question stuff , but inciting hate does n't lead to anything good, 
   like anyone will uphold them to this they 're illegal immigrants . 
  by overstaying their welcome they 're breaking the law ( they broke the law by entering the country in the first place \u010dl 39 . zakona o strancima ) and everyone who helps them will break the law ( \u010dl . 
  43 . zakona o strancima ), 
   into hungary or slovenia ? 
  their plan is , obviously , slovenia - every country between turkey and germany is like a ` bed & breakfast ' for them, 
   does anyone here know what is going on ? 
  do the politicians know ? 
  pm milanovi\u0107 said that yesterday . 
  his statement was misinterpreted - he wanted to say that croatia will just write them up and , if they do not claim asylum ( which no one since has ) , they have 30 days to leave croatia or will be forcibly deported, 
   hungarian border defense `` xenophobic '' and `` anti-muslim '' you can still claim asylum in hungary if you 're non-hungarian/muslim or cross the border with a valid passport ( and a visa if you need one ), 
   what 's next for them ? 
  i do n't know . 
  they 've got 30 days to leave the country so they 'll prolly try to swarm the slovenian/hungarian border, 
   so , croatia is the next bih thing military sources have said they might close the border soon ( judging by the influx of migrants ), 
   about 8 000 refugees entered croatia and yet not a single one claimed asylum, 
  i totally understand hungarians now ... croatia is being swarmed , everyone around us is closing their border , and the eu politicians are saying they do n't give a fuck what we do with them , but we ca n't send them west . 
  this will turn out great for us / s, 
   the only smart move by our government would be communicating with your government , and closing down the borders with army on both sides working together . 
  hahaha yeah . 
  the minister of interior ostoji\u0107 talked to the serbian minister and got nothing out of it . 
  they 're basically dumping them on the croatian border and have already said they wo n't accept anyone back ( told the hungarians they 'd have to deport the migrants back to greece ), 
   i ca n't even comprehend the leven of unpreparedness of our country for something like this . 
  it 's not like someone airlifted them from god knows where and dropped them here . 
  the worst thing is they knew what would happen since the hungarians did n't put that fence up over night . 
  they should just step down now - they 'll get wrecked in the general election either way, 
   boy this escalated quickly . 
  one of the migrants who are staging that `` protest '' hit a cameraman in the head with a rock . 
  some photographer tackled the migrant and held him until the police arrived . 
  ** they 're chanting ` freedom ' and mentioning merkel **, 
   did anybody slow down the flow of migrants ? 
  no , he 's probably just trying to calm the public . 
  more than 6 thousand migrants have crossed the border in the first 24 or so hours , more than 2 thousand enter serbia on a daily basis , and they 've started transporting all the migrants to the croatian border,

  europans ca n't escape bureaucracy even on the internet, 
   wait until croatia has 20,000 of these folks coming per weekend well , since `` we '' 've had 5 thousand migrants crossing the border in the first 24 hours , the shit will hit the fan pretty soon . 
  it 's pretty obvious the people are against the idea of playing refugee camp , no matter what the media shills say, 
  translation of what he said in the parliament : * `` i 've talked to the slovenian minister of the interior ( vesna gy\u00f6rk\u00f6s \u017dnidar ) . 
  if needed , we 'll set up a corridor '' ( for the migrants to pass through ) *, 
   they usually do n't just peacefully go into the camp and say thanks for the food and beds no troublemakers so far . 
  croatia is pretty efficient at protecting its borders , unlike countries from se europe . 
  there 's also an option of mobilising police officers from other counties so ...  it 'll be interesting to see how you can keep up with the system unless germany lets them in true . 
  i guess they 'll have to pull a hungary and process the migrants on the border since there 's some 3000 of them at the border already, 
   will croatia register them then everyone is registered  put them in closed camps ? 
  yes , everyone is fingerprinted and moved to the centres ran by the ministry of interior  or just let them pass like they pass macedonia and serbia no , that would be against the law, 
   especially if they stick to main roads you do realise croatia is homogenous to the point where non-slavs outside of zagreb are extremely rare pokemon , right ? 
  even if they make it in illegally , they 'll get arrested, 
   we 'll most likely send everyone else back to croatia i do n't think anyone else will get asylum/be let through either way, 
   they will be able to pass through croatia he is most likely talking about syrians who germans have a fetish for, 
   no sane person will take it as a compliement it 's more like `` at least we 're not retards who let their countries get flooded by a bunch of future welfare leeches . 
  if that means we 're nazis - okay , we are . 
  have a good day '' . 
  despite our flaws , we are much more rational than your average `` westerner '' - at least i think so, 
   no , they wo n't wtf ... yeah , sure . 
  being labeled `` nazi '' is the least of our problems ( croatia has been labeled `` nationalistic '' by the austrian finance minister the other day and we get called out for `` nationalism '' all the time ) either way . 
  i 'm afraid of our pm caving in to the eu because this is really a lose-lose situation for him/his party, 
   will be called nazi anyway for this .
