how about instead of downvoting me , you explain how pavelic , a fascist genocidal maniac is comparable to partisan communist , tudjman ? 
   the square should carry the name of glorious freedom fighter power ranger president franjo tudman , and the city should be renamed to pavelicgrad . 
  ah , a man can only dream . 
  are you equalizing tudjman and pavelic ? 
  as in you ca n't be a fan of one without being a fan of the other ? 
  [ hrvatnik in his natural habitat ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urihdvvzi_g ), 
  could it be better than this [ klasik ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjz0xzuw7mw ), 
  didnt the us advise tudjman , not to to reclame the territory ? 
  calling it a nato or us event is delusional . 
   carpet bombs yes . 
  be careful when you vacuum . 
  i thing you mean carpet bombing . 
  carpet bomb is not an actual bomb , its the practice of how you deploy bombs . 
  yugoslavia was a great idea on paper . 
  but when you bring in the highly emotionally unstable human element . 
  things fall to pieces . 
  perhaps if yugoslavia were a democracy there would have been less paranoia ? 
  whoever thinks `` greater albania '' will happen is mislead . 
  i understand the rage over kosovo being ripped from serbia . 
  it 's a major part of serbian history . 
  but kosovo merging with albania ? 
  i do n't thing any of the governments want any more conflict . 
  relations between japan and america appear pretty stable though . 
  well it should be no surprise larger nations use smaller ones like puppets . 
  what ? 
  ca n't here you over our upgraded and lethal , an-2 , [ crop-dusters ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_war_of_independence#croatian_forces ) not as intimidating as the serb 's ( yugoslav 's at the time ) [ migs ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mikoyan-gurevich_mig-21 ) but effective . 
  quite obvious ukrainian fascists painted these insignia on their tanks to make it seem russians ground forces were there ... ... ... . 
  i see , thanks . 
  have you looked into my recent report ? 
  why cant we have just on , at least one positive news post about croatia or serbia ? 
  are we really that bad ? 
  wait , 15 to 25 percent of our population is immigrants ? 
  from where , croatia ? 
  well you did say gdp and not per capita  relax alpine bro , just having fun with ya . 
  serbia , bosnia and i know very well you are the more economicly responsible of the group . 
  ah , 97 billion gdp , impressive yep beats our 58 billion . 
  oh wait , that 's slovakia , sorry i get you guys confused , lol . 
  yeah you guys are at 48 billion . 
  shall we close the gap by downgrading ?

  would solve the whole flag debacle , 
  would slovenia like to get in on this ? 
  really ? 
  because i have noticed derogatory comments towards serbians and a substantial amount towards croatians as of late on this subreddit . 
  `` nobody gives a fuck about croats '' . 
  not very productive . 
  there are some users who should be warned or banned , it comes obvious they abuse this page to post links for the sole purpose of insults and attacks rather than education . 
  i understand mods can not be everywhere all the time but i feel more should be done . 
  i think the person to be mad at is orban not hungary . 
  we are not on the list i assume since we have no jobs to strike from : i, 
   famous poster that always spews nonsense here which i wo n't name is actually from moldova . 
  oh i know him . 
  he was having a field day with votapmen 's post a while ago about the ustase . 
  i suspect him of being a troll account also . 
  i noticed a lot of hostile comments , many getting upvotes , that made me wonder do people really agree with this ? 
  i wish more serbian redditors would openly oppose and expose these idiots . 
   there 's really no aggression or hatred aside from seselj 's political party the posts by many serbian ( i assume based on context and the flair ) redditors make me feel otherwise . 
  i mean there are also croatian redditors posting idiotic things but not anywhere to the extant serbian ones do , unless they might be from rs and not serbia . 
  as for seselj , yes he is an idiot who obviously does n't speak for all serbs just as no one croat speaks for all croats . 
  the thing is seslj was and is good pals with current serbian president nikoli\u0107 , who also harbors hateful views of croats and bosnians . 
   he should return to the hague where he belongs i disagree . 
  he is an asshole , but being an ass-whole does not warrant being sent to prison . 
  else the entire hdz would be there , hehe . 
  his posted a good amount about nato aggression and the bombing of belgrade in 1999 . 
  could be a self hating serb ? 
  meh , there are many anti-bosniak and anti-croat users especially as well , lurking around on this subreddit . 
  just hate-filled idiots . 
  best to ignore them . 
  glad to see the eu taking croatia seriously and treating the country like a proper eu member . 
  making progress !, 
   about how the officer may have been in some fashion involved with the ethnic cleansing or downright genocide of bosniaks , and some were almost implying that his death was almost justified in some sense . 
  trying to justify someones death based on rumors and revenge is absolutely wrong . 
  that is why i find it rich and ironic you would be posting this considering , i do n't know , many months ago , posted about the ustase in response to a post about serbian war crimes in croatia , implying indirectly those killed or driven out deserved it because of what ustase did during wwii . 
  perhaps you have had a change of heart ? 
  those art classes are really paying off . 
  actually it is believed the red and white checker is reference to the uniting of the red and white croatian tribes . 
  the dutch are the lost northern croats xd . 
  i 'd compare the ukraine conflict to the war in croatia in the 90s . 
  you had a minority group that was not in favor of the government and wanted their own nation . 
  [ airport marker actually ] ( http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a02fd0c7484f103663fd4b64a2957a75?convert_to_webp=true ), 
  pff , you just jealous you did n't think of it first . 
  kosovo as an independent nation seems too unstable . 
  i think it should stay part of serbia , but must be made certain kosovars are treated fairly with autonomy . 
  besides , there are enough small corrupt countries in the balkans already xd . 
  serbia is viewed as a mini-russia . 
  it 's dumb but i think that 's their reason . 
  i would like to make certain , serbs know that this was said by an estonian and not a croat . 
  seselj please do n't burn my house down . 
  quick question . 
  what were ukrainian and eastern ukrainian or ethnic russian relations before 2010 and the mass protests ? 
  did ethnic russians always wish for eastern ukraine to reunite with russia ? 
  kind of like the croatian serbian conflict in the early 90s . 
  but in this case the minority wants to join with another nation instead of become an independent one . 
  i would n't say serbia is `` pro-russia '' just `` pro-neutral '' . 
  as for explaining the balkans . 
  might as well check yourself into a mental institution right now . 
  depends who and where you were . 
  mixed bag . 
  germany also , depending which croat you were . 
  perhaps unite with slovenia ?
