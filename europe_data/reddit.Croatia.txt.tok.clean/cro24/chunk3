  what , because of those who collaborated during wwii ( was n't only the croats . . ) or because of crimes committed by croats in the 90s ? 
  if you are the kind of person who thinks only serbs were victims , then that really paints you a nationalist . 
  if so , i have nothing more to say to you . 
  correct me if i misinterperated , but those three words leave little else to conclude . 
  you get to be part of the club . 
  also you get false hopes and broken dreams . 
  and you get bragging rights to your neighbors who are n't in it . 
  that 's actually quite touching . 
  glad to see everyone playing well . 
  apologies , did n't know anything about this . 
  i 'm not really on / r/croatia . 
  all i saw was guuulj disagreeing with my post and linking me to to / r/serbia that he said was turned into / r/croatia and saying `` ca n't say the same for you guys '' . 
  he did not say it was imitating / r/rvacka . 
  sorry again for no looking more into context . 
  was n't complaining about the joke , did n't realize it was a joke all were in on :p is there an alternate link to what the page looked like yesterday . 
  would have liked to see it . 
  more like you turned / r/serbia into / r/rvacka . 
  all you guys did was post ustase and primitive stuff . 
  only proves my previous comment xd . 
  had / r/croatia done the same you guys would bombard the subbredit with hate comments . 
  edit : grammar, 
  there may be no evidence to prove him guilty . 
  if it 's not found now it never will be found . 
  and should be released . 
  but he did help create a breeding ground for hatred and nationalism that led to expulsion of croats and other non-serbs from parts of vojvodina and croatia . 
  you ca n't arrest him for it , but i would n't sub to his insanity nor anyone who supports such hatred . 
  if you call him making obscene remarks involving sucking cock intelligent , well ... 
   24 sata and b92 http://i.huffpost.com/gadgets/slideshows/321105/slide_321105_3009295_free.gif, 
  they hate us cause they anus . 
  in croatian it 's `` dobrodo\u0161li '' so for serbian it would be same . 
  it 's a great bonding exercise !, 
  thats ' how it works . 
  he probably made a `` yo moma '' joke that got to the judge and he ca n't leave it behind . 
  seselj has reached elite troll status . 
  i think croatia can understand as well . 
  what they do n't want you to know is that tudjman sabotaged apollo 13 . 
  croats caused global warming , 9/11 and polio . 
  do n't try to deny history !, 
  one should always be willing to start a new chapter . 
  it 's for the best . 
  do n't fall for his trolling . 
  unhappy with their lives so the spend time inciting fights . 
  / u/crnaruka is the worst of them . 
  i thought the balkan region was interesting . 
  there are no concerns about contamination ? 
  or is the radiation that minor ? 
  simple . 
  how was the bosnian war solved ? 
  can someone explain to me why depleted uranium was used ? 
  aha , its the second hand smoke from bulgaria that is the reason !, 
  well i 'm convinced ... / s, 
   their fathers that is assuming if every one of their ancestors participated . 
  eh , they were pressure by a certain neighbor . 
  also would n't cite that attack as a win for them  . 
  more like nazi and chetnik removal expertise . 
  now that 's an impressive [ resume ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/montenegro#world_war_ii ) . 
  it 's cute . 
  like a little beauty mark ... that should be our ... ... ( calm down man , calm down ), 
  he is troll bating you . 
  forget him . 
  g8 b8 m8 i r8 8/8, 
  you sure you want intervention ? 
  be careful , america is looking for its next delivery of `` freedom '' . 
   bosnia and croatia - german no thanks , bre, 
  / u/crnaruka 's [ trollmate ] ( http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/06/24/1403629715984_wps_7_albanian_prime_minister_e.jpg ), 
  fab-ce fabulous central europe, 
  serbia !, 
  hand grenades go in recycling , not garbage !, 
  come on guys ... 
  oh please . 
  did you see the way bosnia was dressed ? 
  she was asking for it . 
  her friend ukraine is no different . 
  nice , we got some too . 
  ours specialize in smoke bombs . 
  considering the president of serbia is a major nationalists and talked about how `` that the boundaries of greater serbia along the virovitica-karlovac-karlobag line were not part of any imperialistic politics , but would always remain a `` dream '' for him and other radical leaders '' and that `` vukovar was a serb city and croats have nothing to go back to there '' and `` there was no genocide in srebrenica . 
  in srebrenica '' i 'd say not . 
  i think a lot of serbs want to move forward , but there are those who do n't . 
  croatia used to be in bad shape as well , but a lot has changed . 
  of course wub_wub likes to think otherwise , but one can see for themselves what the situation is . 
  he is proving your point by living in the past himself . 
  so does his president ... 
  breaking a cyrillic sign in vukovar . 
  a lot of these people were there when serb forces invaded and killed many civilians . 
  there are still tensions there . 
  breaking the sign is dumb , but how this group of people represents all of croatia is beyond stupid . 
  i mean we 've made progress . 
  there 's just a lot more to be done . 
  citizens need to realize they are key in making progress happen . 
  the whole `` hey our polaticians are corrupt , but they are our fellow country men so they know what is best '' mentality needs to end . 
  and it will . 
  and it is begginnig to . 
  the arrest of zagreb mayor bandic months ago i think is one of the big chapters of the change yo come . 
   just do n't expect miracles , countries do n't change over night croatia : trying to become a democracy since 1991 . 
  i do n't know . 
  i 'm going to need proof of this . 
  so this is what an unbiased documentary free of evil western propaganda looks like . 
  thing is , if he did pass away , even if it is proved so , some will say it was an assassination regardless which could cause chaos in russia . 
  so putin , please be alive and well . 
   pressure from the communists yep , this is true .
