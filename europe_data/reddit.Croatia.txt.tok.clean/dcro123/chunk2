  the first one i could find : http://speisa.com/modules/articles/index.php/item.1926/stasi-veteran-to-manage-censorship-on-facebook.html google her name and facebook and you 'll find other sources if you wish . 
  sargon is a leftist . 
  look at any of his videos about economics . 
  or better yet look at his videos about stromfront retards . 
  i liked this one , though i have n't seen all of it . 
  rubin seems like a fair guy willing to talk to or listen to anyone . 
  thanks . 
  is there any particular reason they decided to build half of it as a tunnel ? 
  does that strait have heavy maritime traffic or something ? 
  did he at least tip his fedora to his senpai before the act like a true gentleman ? 
  and this is `` solved '' by bringing in more and more people . 
  good luck britain , get out while you still can . 
  do as romanians did . 
  why do you care ? 
  just anschluss them . 
  not denying that partisans did some messed up stuff or that they have n't committed their share of war crimes , just that they did most of that after the war with reprisals and forced resettlement and even killing priests and blowing up churches and stuff . 
  nobody cared in the beginning . 
  later the party norms were enforced and more and more people had to be party members . 
  here 's an interview with a partisan veteran about his experiences , particularly regarding operation schwartz : http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/spektar/tabid/94/articletype/articleview/articleid/219429/default.aspx he specifically mentions an orthodox priest crying over the death of sava kova\u010devi\u0107 . 
  true , but german reprisals on the civilian population took their toll as well . 
  to them it did n't really matter who was who . 
  well , you had muslims fighting for the nazis , and against them . 
  it varied . 
  for : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_waffen_mountain_division_of_the_ss_handschar_ ( 1st_croatian ) against : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans#bosnia_and_herzegovina overall , i do n't think germans had an explicit plan for exterminating muslims , although a lot were killed . 
  conclusion : it was basically a clusterfuck . 
  `` the most puzzling development in politics during the last decade is the apparent determination of western european leaders to re-create the soviet union in western europe . '' -- mikhail gorbachev https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/138353.mikhail_gorbachev, 
  they do n't have a monopoly any more , that deal expired around 2006 , i think . 
  there 's about 5-6 players on the market but they have been mostly bought up by dt and vip . 
  i agree with you on deregulation though and thanks for the info . 
  i had no idea it was actually like that in romania . 
  if i understand it correctly , romania had no infrastructure ( or an incredibly shitty one ) and you guys had to build it from scratch , but since you built it late optic fibres were around and were relatively common , whereas croatia had a shitty infrastructure but it was workable . 
  there 's also our idiot government selling our state telecommunications company ( complete with the infrastructure ) to dt with a guarantee of a 5 year monopoly . 
  thankfully now we have more operators , and competition is heating up i guess . 
  depends on which part . 
  the north was fucked by hungary , the south by austria . 
  depends on your distance from the phone switchboard . 
  it can go up to 50 ( if you live right next to the damn thing ) . 
  some of us converted to vdsl , though t-com is laying optic cables right now . 
  same . 
  i 'd rather be openly fucked in the ass by an austrian , than covertly by a german . 
  at least you know you place , even though it 's not much of a consolation . 
  we 're going to be bankrupt in 2 years , only our situation is going to be worse than in greece because we 're not in the eurozone , and thus other eurozone countries have no incentives to bail us out . 
  all of this thanks to our corrupt and incompetent politicians . 
  i predict even more people will leave the country , germany might use us as an asylum camp from which they will take asylum seekers , while the ones they do n't take will ravage our country . 
  ( this might happen in the really long term if current policies are not reversed . 
  i do n't see it happening in the near future . ), 
  ties were an alternative to [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ruff_\\ ( clothing \\ ) ) . 
  the last time they were in power the serbian minority party was in their coalition . 
  so much for nazism . 
  they are mostly harmless . 
  they like to beat their chest a lot and emphasise their christianity to the point of parody , but other than that i personally hate them because they robbed the country during their last term . 
   nationalistic shit and de facto socialism are still at the forefront . 
  yep , and sometimes rolled into one . 
  as is the case with our current government . 
  or it could be these things which you conveniently ignored from my previous comments .

  not trying to be a dick here , but it was widespread . 
  the new york daily news , the telegraph , cnn , the associated press , nbc , msnbc , afp and the new york times . 
  i was referring to any other group . 
  including girls . 
  especially girls . 
  this is consistent regardless of income . 
  quote the exact line for me where it says what you claim . 
   not true . 
  not true at all . 
  white boys who do not need free food during lunch are close to equal to the other boys . 
  it 's only when they 're considered poor that the school performances are lower . 
  again , citation needed . 
   when they 're not poor , the statistics are more equal . 
  citation needed . 
   not sure what you 're trying to show here , other than being poor means you do worse at school . 
  nice goalpost shift you tried to do there . 
  i like how you ignored that in the same income group white boys are significantly worse off than any other group that was researched . 
   now explain how this is the left 's fault , please . 
  https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/eliminating-feminist-teacher-bias-erases-boys-falling-grades-study-finds http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/?single_page=true, 
  http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34667100/poor-white-boys-get-a-worse-start-in-life-says-equality-report i await your reply . 
  it may be unprecedented in scale , and the sheer temerity of the offenders , but this is part of a trend that has been going on for a while . 
  this is even prevalent in asylum centres , but you would n't know about it since the media outright covers it up . 
  which ones ? 
  name a few . 
  i can however provide an example of news deliberately choosing to not show the charlie hebdo cover . 
  i prefer the other solution , which is to simply not accept those with those values and the need for police would n't be as high . 
   because germans do n't commit crimes amirite ? 
  not on this scale or intensity , no . 
  arab and north african cultures view women as inferior and take no issues to sexual assault or rape of women , unlike germans . 
  it 's semantics , but semantics drive policy . 
  for instance labelling all of the migrants that came in the last 3-4 months via the balkan route `` refugees '' drives sympathy and pushes for policy , when actually we have no idea whether or not they are refugees at all . 
  it 's safer to assume they are not , and implement a harsher system for checking rather than assuming they are and implementing a laxer system ( like sweden is doing ) . 
  this does n't invalidate anything i said . 
  they have to be proven to be refugees , not proven to not be refugees . 
  i do n't think that 's what he meant . 
  i think he meant why are you assuming they are refugees by default , instead of assuming they are economic migrants by default . 
  it would make more sense since most of them are economic migrants . 
  when was i inconsistent ? 
  and what does someone else 's opinion have to do with what i wrote in the first reply ? 
  i would n't care if he says what he says , but since we 're living in a society with restricted speech it should be restricted equally for everyone , which is not since you have muslims inciting hatred and intolerance getting off scot free , and their critics being persecuted ( socially and sometimes legally ) . 
  the equality of application of current laws has nothing to do with this argument , and the previous sentence is a bad argument . 
  the real reason i do n't like a society with restricted speech is because in it you ca n't address the underlying issues of a particular subject . 
  this requires airing out even the most insane arguments because debating them is the only way we can discredit them .
