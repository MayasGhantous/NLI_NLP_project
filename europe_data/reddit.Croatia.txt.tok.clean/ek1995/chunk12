  hungarian looks like something that would be in lord of the rings . 
   implying montenegrin is a language, 
  oh yeah , '' \u043f\u0443\u0448\u0435\u045a\u0435 \u0443\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430 '' followed by `` pu\u0161enje ubija '' followed by `` pu\u0161enje ubija . '', 
  hungary ... 
  `` same text displayed twice on the cereal box '' sounds about right . 
  good shit , op . 
  `` have you heard of the republika srpska ? 
  it 's a great place , it really is . 
  it is currently the only european state that is repelling muslim oppression . 
  hopefully we 'll be independent soon , our president dodik is the most powerful man in the balkans . 
  a great example of his power is that he will push for our independence , and maybe even unite us with our brothers across the drina river . 
  the republika srpska is a shining example of serbian unity , and serb unity actually dates back to even ww1 . 
  did you know serb unity was the first unity to ever occur in human history ? 
  it 's true . 
  our leader , dodik , was actually on the front lines in ww1 during some of the heaviest fighting of the war . 
  in fact , it was dodik who even founded serbia , the republika srpska , and even the serb people themselves . '', 
  they 're protesting . 
  and they 're protesting * a lot . 
  * and they 're protesting a lot , because they 're angry , they 're very angry , and * belieeeeve me , * i know what it 's like to be angry . 
  some would say even i 'm angry , just a near-constant state of anger . 
  they 're protesting and they 're gon na keep going . 
  facts . 
  are you fucking kidding me ? 
  gbit for $ 10/month ? 
  google fiber does that here , but i have no idea how much it costs . 
  so she 's behind them ? 
  i 'm also hoping macron and fillon are more reasonable . 
  i 'm not keeping up too much with french politics . 
  i 'm jealous . 
  my speeds with comcast are 100mbps and it 's like $ 70 a month . 
  there also used to be a 500gb/month cap , but then they put it to 1tb . 
  i was using over 500gb every month and was incurring a shit ton of fees . 
  for 10 months we were also not getting the speeds we were promised . 
  i had to give their customer service hell , so they agreed to cut the price down to $ 50/month , and we also got a new router . 
  the router fixed the problem . 
  i strongly doubt these problems happen in romania . 
  that 's sad . 
  it really is . 
  faster average speeds , too . 
  hopefully you guys get shit done over there with your demonstrations . 
  other ... countries in the balkans protest and nothing changes . 
  waiting for `` tvrtkokraljsrbljem '' and his alternative facts, 
  is n't this dumbass currently leading the polls in france ? 
  i think it has a similar meaning in bosnian , too , that 's really cool . 
  usually it 's just used to refer to the music itself , though . 
  the horror !, 
  this is a clear human rights violation !, 
  yes , it 's bosnian and it is sung in bosnian but it is heavily turkish influenced . 
  what does it mean in crete ? 
  haris is really an incredible singer . 
  i like his songs where he sings in the roma language , even though i ca n't understand them . 
  no , i 'm well aware it 's monthly , but 1,020 is just lower than i thought it was . 
  i was under the impression slovenia was much wealthier than that . 
  it was just a surprise is all . 
  oh , ok , so the $ 1,020 is what 's left over after taxes and what not . 
  still not great , really . 
  rent , bills , groceries , etc. 
  the average wage in slovenia is certainly higher than a meager $ 1,020 . 
  it 's got to be . 
  is this before or after the dissolution ? 
  it does n't make sense for the average pay in slovenia to be $ 1,020 / month . 
  edit : why am i being downvoted ? 
  i just thought they made more than that , ffs . 
   musical relations between europe and the ottoman empire  does not mention bosnian sevdah #triggered, 
  you as a dane should have no problem getting to and staying in croatia/montenegro . 
  whichever one you were referring to , lol . 
  lol, 
  i just ca n't wait to wake up and see a news headline `` global piece of shit george soros dead '' motherfucker needs to hurry up and croak . 
  because it 's shit for everyone due to us dumbass south slavs voting for retards . 
  that 's why . 
  nobody seems to want to cooperate because they 're all nationalist dickheads who serve their own interests . 
  if people wisened up a little , things would be better . 
  also a complete change of all govt officials would probably help too . 
  their splinter republics would never survive , and no one would recognize them . 
  the entirety of europe would place embargoes , and they would have an economic collapse probably followed by hunger , violence , etc. 
  independence will do them more harm than good . 
  all in the name of `` muh srbstvo '' and `` muh hrvatstvo . '', 
  anyway . 
  they can all keep dreaming . 
  ah , just like the good old days , am i rite ? 
  yeah it was . 
  a little revolution never hurt anyone . 
  but yeah the app has been acting weird lately . 
  like showing a notification on the little envelope even though there 's no new notification . 
  wait could you actually click the link ? 
  my phone did n't show it as blue lol, 
  bosniaks are not `` losing '' bosnia , there are simply unfair and illegal rules being put in place . 
  what are they supposed to do ? 
  protest and watch as nothing happens ? 
  oh yeah , all bosniaks support that 100 % right ? 
  sda totally is n't selling out to deepen their own pockets or anything right ? 
  explain, 
  the ignorance here is mind-boggling . 
  yeah but that 's in iran :(, 
  where in europe do they not learn the nazis did the holocaust ? 
  and where did this sudden band of social justice warriors come from ? 
  how am i arrogant ?
