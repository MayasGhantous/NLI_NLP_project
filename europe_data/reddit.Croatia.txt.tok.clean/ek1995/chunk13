  lol, 
  not quite sure what that means, 
  you 're hamstering . 
  everybody knows that it was nazi germany perpetrating those terrible things . 
  i do n't know what happened in taiwan . 
  and i 'm not butt hurt in any way about what the usta\u0161e did . 
  just because i 'm from croatia , it does n't mean i condone what they did . 
  people like that are in the extreme minority back home . 
  why do n't you put up a flair so i can call you out on what your government has done in the past ? 
  you 're just fucking around with me , right ? 
  you got me there . 
  this is retarded . 
  everyone knows the camps were nazi-run , they just call them polish camps because they were in poland . 
  legend, 
  i think yugo would be something like china in terms of government/society if it were around today . 
  i 'm not saying yugo was perfect , the economy was flawed from the very start , faaaar too much borrowing going on . 
  i think we can all agree though that at least we all lived together peacefully and many really * believed * in yugoslavia and bratstvo i jedinstvo . 
  i do n't think another yugoslavia should form , but i think we should all be good friends and have the best relations we possibly can with each other . 
  why would n't we ? 
  if we had the same relationships with each other as the scandinavian countries do , i think we 'd be alright . 
  really $ 100 billion is not that bad . 
  croatia owes somewhere around half that . 
  i think serbia owes even more than half . 
  also see : united states debt , japan debt . 
  exactly . 
  so are there any assassin hideouts , or ? 
  in 1991 , yugoslavia 's foreign debt was only $ 20 billion . 
  yeah , but the economic troubles were greatly exaggerated . 
  yugo 's debt problem was n't anything new or impossible to solve . 
  croatia 's debt now is huge . 
  yeah , but not much better off , and the same problems in croatia exist elsewhere in south europe . 
  i did an edit . 
  and croatia is still not better than in 91 . 
  we were still a part of yugo until then . 
  i think it 's because we ( people from the balkans ) know that wars are essentially pointless . 
  just look at all former yugoslavian states . 
  all of their economies are worse * now * than in * 1991 , * the height of all the bullshit before yugo 's dissolution . 
  things were so bad in yugoslavia at one point , that you had to spend your paycheck before midnight on friday because the money you made would have been totally worthless the next morning . 
  i also think that bosnia 's number could be exaggerated , simply due to the fact that people born after the war have no good reason to fight . 
  the economy is sluggish , politics are rampant with corruption , and people overall just have a generally bleak outlook in life . 
  fighting in another war would just be pointless . 
  you 're right though , serbia 's number was really surprising given the fact that the military is/was a big part of their culture historically . 
  edit : slovenia is the only ex-yu country that is doing better now than in ' 91 . 
  everyone else is doing not so well . 
  i do n't get it . 
  is this supposed to mock the people who died or something ? 
  if so , that 's fucked up and something i 'd expect from a frustrated high school freshman , not from adults . 
  is n't rain unusual , period ? 
  lol, 
  me neither . 
  we were just freezing our asses off last week and now it 's spring-like weather . 
  i used to live in nc , too , it 's not nearly as bad as here . 
  i 'm in atlanta and it 's too damn warm . 
  the horror **, 
  it 's not that deep . 
  i live in the states if you 're on pc hover your mouse over my flair . 
  m1911 's are alright , they 're notorious for jamming though . 
  whenever i see someone post a picture on any gun sub , i 'm tempted to ask them if they want some toast with that jam . 
  but they 're ok guns . 
  ** gripzone ** well springfield wants it there , not hs . 
  i actually just picked up a springfield xd9 subcompact . 
  it 's a great gun . 
  and no , it does not have ** gripzone ** on it in case i forget where to grasp the gun . 
  if it was n't for those meddling germans , the french would probably be using [ this . 
  ] ( http://modernfirearms.net/assault/hr/vhs-2-e.html ), 
  holy . 
  shit . 
  how old are you ? 
  honestly . 
  how bout no ? 
  lol, 
  is it really ? 
  and yes . 
  yes it will . 
  strawberry fructal best fructal . 
  bullshit , i love strawberry fructal . 
  russia being some kind of `` big brother '' to serbia is one of the greatest misconceptions ever lol . 
  afaik russia 's position on kosovo is more of `` meh . '', 
  than it is pro-serbia . 
  russia aready has virtually no influence in the balkans . 
  i will say however , kosovo was taken from serbia in a dirty way , but what 's done is done . 
  trying to take kosovo by force again is simply not a viable option . 
  by both do you mean kosovo and albania ? 
  i did an edit comment , u/cabezzas corrected me . 
  either way , i still think that his comments are important . 
  ** edit : ** dra\u0161kovi\u0107 is no longer in politics , i made a mistake, 
  fuck , you 're right , i 'll need to do an edit, 
  wow . 
  it 's also great you have members of all 3 ethnic groups . 
  that was fake . 
  he never apologized to the serbs . 
  what does russia have to do with this ? 
  and yes , trump seems to be opposed to nato and he even called it obsolete ( something i actually agree with ) which is very interesting . 
  no more soviet union amd no more warsaw pact , so what 's the point of nato ? 
  however you need to remember , america was not the only country involved in kosovo . 
  kosovo also works closely with the us so i doubt trump is going to suddenly turn his back on them . 
  that 's great to hear . 
   they start receiving threats , and sometimes they get physical that is * not * so great to hear . 
  you should be able to have police protection if it is an organized and registered party , though . 
  i think police have an obligation to take things like that seriously when democratic political parties are threatened .
