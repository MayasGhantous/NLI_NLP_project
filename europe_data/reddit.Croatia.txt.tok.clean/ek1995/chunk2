  that 's gross . 
  why has n't the government there done anything ? 
  that 's disgusting and so unhealthy , you can only imagine what kind of bullshit is going in there if it 's selling for that low . 
  i 'm assuming you 're talking about brexit , right ? 
  lol, 
  seriously ? 
  so what exactly does this mean ? 
  are we spending money on things like improving industries , healthcare , education , army , etc ? 
  why do n't they just put an increased tax on soda , period ? 
  it 'll help everyone that way . 
  hungary was just across our border , and we had tensions with them during their time as a satellite ( poor guys ) . 
  russian tanks were visible from our border with hungary , so we increased our presence . 
  they backed down . 
  again , these are different times . 
  as i said , russia will get crushed if they try anything . 
  your politicians , as this post said , are distributing pamphlets to citizens as if the ruskies are gon na invade you tomorrow , do you still not see that they are unnecessarily worrying you ? 
  actually , russia as the ussr tried to make us a satellite while we were yugoslavia . 
  we shit on them and said no , then they tried assassinating our president several times , to which he publicly said [ `` fuck you , we caught them . 
  '' ] ( https://m.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2cgyyy/til_josip_broz_tito_fed_up_with_stalin_sending/ ) however , that was then , and this is now . 
  russia has zero to gain from `` conquering '' your countries or anyone else 's . 
  your politicians are just fearmongering . 
  lol 'd at `` imperialism '' there 's simply no point . 
  `` should they invade '' why would they ? 
  what would be a possible reason ? 
  do the baltics have resources ? 
  oil ? 
  the only reason russia would attack is because romania is full of fucking missiles aimed at russia for little to no good reason . 
  politicians are just hyping all this up for whatever reason . 
  russia knows they ca n't invade . 
  they just would n't stand a chance against nato . 
  ukraine themselves held their ground against them fairly well . 
  do you really , truly , honestly believe that the russians would invade your countries ? 
  what would the purpose be ? 
  all i 've seen the past week on here is `` nato moving troops along border '' this and `` russia threatening baltics '' that and everyone is panicking about that as if russia actually has something to gain from doing that . 
  do people really believe that russia would be stupid enough to attack the baltic countries knowing nato would bear down on them ? 
  russia simply could n't handle something like that , and even if they could , i just do n't see a good reason for them too . 
  can someone please explain all this russia fearmongering ? 
  uhhh , but why the hell would they ? 
  ya know , like ... a real government . 
  well , shit , lol . 
  i said that or as an accepted second currency , lol, 
  basically they 're tired of the bullshit and really do want to bring about change . 
  they want to keep things largely the way they are , ( the amazing benefits and such ) but also give the people a government that is actually for them and will serve them ( as it should be imo ) . 
  i believe they also want to make the bitcoin either their primary currency or a sort of `` second '' currency that will be accepted anywhere in the country . 
  yeah , we have some nutjobs in our government , and he is definitely one of them . 
  the forecasts simply do n't matter , just like how even though the weatherman said it would rain today , it was just cloudy . 
  the only way to see the real effects/damages will be to wait until after brexit really happens . 
  they 're the english . 
  the pound has been a top currency for decades . 
  they 'll do just fine . 
  well , at least we specialize in kidney transplants . 
  i 'm sorry for your loss . 
  they got that good weed in serbia huh ? 
  no , all of those cities are and will stay part of bosnia . 
  look at a map of yugoslavia and you 'll see the socialist republic borders are the exact same as the current borders today . 
  that 's one reason why . 
  the only significant change to borders was you guys losing kosovo . 
  why would bih fracture into 3 entities ? 
  nobody would recognize any of them , and the international community simply would not allow rs to merge with serbia , because not even serbia wants that ( if vu\u010di\u0107 's words are to be trusted ) . 
  the croats can keep dreaming about a croat state too , dreams are free after all . 
  [ croats in bih actually already have a croat state , they even get dual citizenship there . 
  ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia ) as for serbs , are n't they entitled to some kind of citizenship in serbia ? 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) if they want their independent serb state , they only have to drive east a few hours . 
  as much as serbs and croats hate to say it , they are still bosnians . 
  bosnia will be bosnia . 
  additionally , if the croats made their own state , it would be an act of secession and it would mean that the federation would shrink as well , and bosniaks are then effectively surrounded by `` enemies , '' let 's say . 
  that would also lead to some very fucked up and oddly shaped borders . 
  you also need to ask yourself if these `` independent states '' would even be able to support themselves economically ( which of course , they ca n't ) these dumbass nationalist politicians just need to be thrown out of office and be replaced by people who want to help all 3 sides coexist better . 
  the most important way that can be done is by getting people jobs . 
  people are miserable because they do n't have work , they have no power due to not having money , and they are simply `` stuck . '', 
  i really hope the people themselves are n't as stupid as these asshats in their parliament . 
  particularly us younger people who were born just before , during , or after the war , seeing as to how shitty the living there is ( just like across the whole ex-yu ) and all that is due to assholes like these . 
  i genuinely believe we can all make our respective countries better places and that way we can make people like tu\u0111man , izetbegovi\u0107 , and karad\u017ei\u0107 a thing of the past . 
  my uncle is actually a police officer in doboj , and as far as i know , things there seem to be alright between bosniaks and serbs . 
  good luck , honestly . 
  how exactly do you plan to do that ? 
  kosovo is basically the 51st state and has a huge us military presence there , do you still think you 're yugoslavia with europe 's 4th biggest army ? 
  do you really want belgrade to have the shit bombed out of it again ? 
  because that would really fucking suck , it 's honestly a lovely city , and i 'd really like to go someday . 
  you would n't stand a chance against even the albanians themselves let alone another ifor-like coalition , whether it be now or `` in the next decade or two '' lmao . 
  btw , all of ex-yu 's progress has been minimal , that includes croatia , bosnia , and serbia . 
  ( except slovenia , they 're not doing too bad ) we 're idiots , and that 's why none of us make much progress . 
  fuck this piece of shit, 
  so do you think you 'll take kosovo back ? 
  do you want to be occupied by international coalitions ? 
  because that 's how you get occupied by international coalitions . 
  so do we not count as south europe ? 
  that 's true , i forgot about him but grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 is hugely underrated . 
  why is it such a problem to say that tesla was a serb from croatia ? 
  you ca n't really say austria-hungary because it does n't exist anymore . 
  haha i knew it was either an indian or turkish show , my mom watches the turkish ones all the time and they 're always full of that kind of ridiculous stuff lol . 
  hahaha wtf is this gif ? 
  bosnia and herzegovina would probably be [ this guy ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/husein_grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107 ), 
  there 's a shit ton of people in the states who are starting to simply leave the us after graduating just to doge the loans . 
  the government in the states actually charges interest on the loans you take out , too .

  there 's plenty of music related subs , dumbass , you have the whole fucking internet at your disposal . 
  there 's forums on other sites too, 
  it 's not all too bad .
