  that 's a lot harder to say , lol, 
  so he might actually be putfinn ? 
  would 've been interesting to see bosnia 's composition . 
  it 's also odd how serbians are closer to bulgarians . 
  and exactly how would the us appease to russia ? 
  it was much more likely under her . 
  she wanted to increase sanctions against russia and likely continue onward from there . 
  thank you . 
  let 's wait and see what happens . 
  we can definitely say we 've already averted wwiii because he wants to strengthen ties with russia . 
  you must not have seen the lady who threw hot coffee in a trump voter 's car window in a traffic jam in la. 
  all sides have extremists , but at least trump said something about his . 
  i do n't think trump is really right as much as he 's just someone who says shit to appeal to the right , i.e. 
  if he was really such a person , we would have known years ago , whether it was leaked emails or recorded phone calls ( there was of course the whole pussy recording , but that 's different ) . 
  he has only recently started to identify as a republican and i think it was just up until about 6-7 years ago where he said he was democrat , but do n't quote me on those numbers , lol . 
  not to mention the fact that he publicly denounced any acts of hate or violence on a recent 60 minutes interview . 
  people simply have to accept him , whether they want to or not . 
  that 's democracy , he won fair and square based on the us 's voting system . 
  ok , but he has n't done anything in terms of policy . 
  we know he 's a massive idiot when it comes to things like global warming and its denial , but i do n't quite understand what him associating with the right has anything to do with europe . 
  he has n't even fucking done anything yet , are you kidding me ? 
  obama still has roughly 3 months before he steps out of office . 
  looks like us and most likely our neighbors also suffer from the condition known as balkanism . 
  it 's a meme bro, 
  i think it 's native american in origin . 
  c r o a t i a s t r o n k r o a t i a s t r o n k, 
  s l a v i c s w e a t e r s y n d i c a t e, 
  lol i mean he tried . 
  best part about op is that he is n't even a serb himself . 
  a second srebrenica in * biha\u0107 ? 
  * u wot, 
  hang in there montenegbro, 
  yes , it really is n't a political issue . 
  if they want to get the benefits of the system , they need to become citizens and assimilate . 
  that 's just how it goes . 
  nations have laws . 
   3:38 and i thought traffic in atlanta was bad ... 
  c a n c e r m o d s, 
  just disgusting . 
  then he crashes it into a caf\u00e9 , and pays the owner cash for the damages . 
  or better yet , he just buys the caf\u00e9 . 
  they have more important shit to be doing , like being rich . 
  it probably took the person 1:08 because they were locking in a multi-million dollar business deal over the phone . 
  can someone eli5 me why it is a big deal if a nato member buys weapons from a non-nato member ? 
  or is this a problem because russia , a perceived threat to nato , is in question ? 
  i 'm sure it is lol , but it still looks kinda neat . 
  minus the searchlight . 
  it 's the milky way over dubrovnik . 
  he really is . 
  if you see the `` feminism '' that 's going on in the us , he pretty much nailed an aspect of it here . 
  [ for the uninitiated . 
  yugoslavia stronk yugoslavia progressive human rights leader yugoslavian never judges based on color, 
  i do n't see why countries that can barely stand on their own two feet ( croatia included ) should join the eu . 
  high unemployment , rampant corruption , etc. 
  are all common in ex-yu countries , and they barely get by . 
  i feel as though croatia should have waited several more years and stricter requirements should have been placed on our country . 
  same goes for bih , serbia , and everyone else . 
  yeah , mujahideen we never asked for , nor wanted . 
  they were never successful , anywhere . 
  you should also do some research about the many orthodox volunteers who came to fight with the serbs , they came only in the name of common religion , and wanting to kill bosniaks . 
  nice try . 
  lol, 
  ireland stronk also why do you speak in the 3rd person ? 
  lmao, 
  went on trial multiple times , acquitted each time . 
  please show irrefutable proof of 3,000 dead at the hands of people who were barely armed to start with . 
  they never will , and they know they ca n't . 
  their politicians are playing them . 
  so most bosniaks must love turkey then ( i for one certainly do n't ) ? 
  most croats must love germany too . 
  do you think russia really cares about someone as insignificant as serbia ? 
  all of these `` bra\u0107a '' retards are delusional . 
  whoa , only 3 irish dead . 
  i guess the whole `` fighting irish '' really is n't just a stereotype . 
  no problem . 
  just youtube retards . 
  please do n't let some morons posting cancerous trash on youtube give you the wrong idea , they are a small minority , whether they are bosniak , croat , or serb . 
  also a smart choice . 
  oh , ok , thanks for the input . 
  you did n't get a little booklet ? 
  the stuff my dad has is two little passport-like books . 
  i guess your side did things differently . 
  i guess if you wanted to , you could , i 'm really not trying to be a dick . 
  i do n't really doubt you were there . 
  what rank were you and where were you stationed ? 
  i strongly doubt the front cover of it on a private imgur link would give away your identity . 
  that 's fine though , you do n't have to , of course . 
  i was just asking to see if there was maybe a chance you would . 
  my dad has his from jna and croatian army in a drawer . 
  neat stuff , i guess . 
  it 's kind of like looking at a piece of the past . 
  do you have any proof of serving ? 
  do you have a vojna iskaznica or anything that you could maybe post a picture of ? 
  oh yeah , i saw that msbs rifle , another user linked it . 
  it looks very high quality . 
  you guys could definitely kick some ass with those things , they look extremely high quality . 
  france should have picked up the vhs2 i 'm ^ ^ ^ not ^ ^ ^ saying ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ that ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ just ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ because ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ i 'm ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ croatian ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^, 
  i 'll check it out while we 're stll on the topic lol , thanks, 
  yeah , but do they have two jars of nutella for the price of one in a regular grocery store or supermarket ? 
  you mean him joining the bolsheviks ?
