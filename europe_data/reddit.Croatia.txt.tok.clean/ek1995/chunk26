   burek with cheese does not exist . 
  that is a sirnica . 
   throw some \u0107evapi in the mix \u0106evapi are the sole greatest thing to come from the balkans . 
  the best \u0107evapi are found in sarajevo . 
  edit : forgot \u0107evapi, 
  `` cheese burek '' i am absolutely fucking disgusted . 
  that 's good stuff too . 
  bananko as well . 
  it honestly is , lol . 
  tito definitely liked to live lavish . 
  yugoslavia was a mixed economy . 
  you could call it `` market socialism . '', 
  we absolutely can not allow kra\u0161 to fail . 
  everyone needs to buy all the bajadera and batons that they can . 
  i ca n't live without that stuff . 
  his mic was probably * coated * in spit . 
  that 's an excellent neighbor to be placed by your spies . 
  they clearly speak swiss , you moron / s but yeah , people are generally very unaware of former yugo countries , and if they are , all they know is the war or nice croatian beaches . 
  i live in the states too and i know exactly what you mean . 
  i would tell people i was of bosnian descent but born in croatia and they said `` is n't bosnia in africa ? '', 
  and i 'm like '' ... no . '', 
  according to my parents , when we were yugoslavia , people actually knew about the country and recognized our passports . 
  1991-1995 worst years of my life . 
  tiniest fortress ever . 
  wow , it looks awesome . 
  like out of a movie . 
  looking at the comments and the other posts , it seems they want to defend france from `` muslim takeover . '', 
  the stickied post to the sub is `` 10 million muslims have invaded france . '', 
  yes , invaded . 
  you read that right . 
  there was even a post that said something like `` celebration of macron 's victory in france '' and it showed 5-6 muslim guys praying in the middle of the road . 
  those people are incredibly delusional and if you do n't agree with them , the first thing they say is `` cuck . '', 
  the whole sub is a fucking cesspool . 
  it 's getting a [ little out of hand .

  i copied and pasted it from some site , i 'm on mobile . 
  oh well ( * insert shrug here * ), 
  i can understand indpendence of turkish regions , turkey has a right to ensure its integrity , but turkey is campaigning in syria partly because they want to auppress any movements to create a free kurdish state . 
  but oh well \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
   i think russia actually has the largest stockpile idk , honestly , my point is , russia 's got a lot , and france does n't . 
  in a ground war , i think russia would still have the advantage , too . 
  if they 're anything like what they were in ww2 , it would not be pretty for france . 
  yes , turkey needs to stop wasting time , lives , and resources and focus on is and leave the poor kurds alone for once . 
  the kurds fought incredibly hard at kobane when they were outdone by is in every way possible . 
  does turkey really think that the kurds are a bigger threat than is ? 
  apparently they do , we can see who turkey is more concerned with in syria . 
  remove trump remove trump, 
   quality of the old and new were n't the purges of military personnel in the thousands ? 
  if they were , i 'd say turkey 's army is understaffed and in short supply of experienced commanders . 
   russia is also weaker than france corruption in what section ? 
  economy , government , military ? 
  and also , while we 're talking russia , they have the second largest nuclear weapon stockpile on earth , so , i would say militarily , they are stronger than france . 
  their involvement in syria has also gone much better than turkey 's . 
   turkey is of course not using its full military power maybe they should start using more , lol , because they 're not doing too hot right now . 
  naw , dude , look . 
  a shit ton of turkish officers , commanders , generals , etc. 
  were expelled during erdo 's `` purge '' after the coup last year . 
  the current leadership in turkey 's mission syria is weak and inexperienced , so everything from the top to the bottom is rotten . 
  they may have all the weapons and equipment , but they clearly have no will , and clearly suffer from a lack of quality higher-ups . 
  also morale , motivation , etc. 
  not to mention they are fighting mostly is and kurd groups and still ca n't really do much . 
  even the pentagon said the turks got their asses kicked not too long ago . 
  i think they failed to defend a town from an is advance . 
  if the turks ca n't deal with is , what makes you think they can deal with france ? 
  ahh ok , alternative nationalism , then ? 
  ehh not really . 
  their progress in syria has been sluggish thus far . 
  this bitch is high as fuck, 
  i see what you did there, 
  leave it to the french to get an apc stolen / s, 
  i 'm sure plenty of people do n't even attempt to deny or whitewash anything , many are proud of what he and others did . 
  i think vice did a piece on karad\u017ei\u0107 when he fled to belgrade and grew out a beard and became some kind of `` alternative medicine '' guru . 
  he had a legit business and for a long time , no one knew it was him . 
  eventually when he got found out and arrested , they interviewed some locals and one guy was pissed that karad\u017ei\u0107 did n't tell him because he would have sheltered him in his house and given him anything he needed . 
  naturally . 
  i think that 's actually exactly the way they are , their interpretation of christianity is much older and just `` weird . '', 
  you 're right , jebo ti nas tbh . 
  oh come on , 2,000 camel jockeys were supposed to make any kind of difference ? 
  and most of us were n't even welcoming of them , you know that . 
  did n't know about that . 
  it still does n't look like they did a whole lot . 
  i think their biggest impact was giving the bosniaks a bad look . 
  mainly russia . 
  but greek , bulgarian , and even romanian volunteers were not unheard of . 
  he 's a piece of shit . 
  he 's also highly revered in the rs . 
  gotcha , so when you go on videos of bosnian war songs/war footage and you see `` remove kebab '' they 're talking about turks , and not us . 
  makes sense . 
  everyone knows the phrase `` karadzic is drinking bosniak tears . '', 
  remove kebab is always talking about bosniaks . 
  the 4,000 orthodox volunteers on the serb side should be a bigger concern . 
  the goatfuckers did n't do much . 
  seriously . 
  the most the arabs did was fuel serb and croat propaganda . 
  it 's not fair to dutch people . 
  dutchbat called for air support/reinforcements and never got them . 
  the people who denied their requests should be the ones taking the heat , not the dutch . 
  take your rational thinking and sensibility somewhere else !, 
  this is r/europe !, 
  at this rate , they can probably do more with trucks than guns .
