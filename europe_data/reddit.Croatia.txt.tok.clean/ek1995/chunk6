  hold on , second in the * country ? 
  oh i know velenje , there 's a contestant on zvezde granda from there . 
  did not know that . 
  i wonder how much of our diaspora is in slovenia as a whole . 
  holy shit `` da , \u017eao nam je osame '' fuck those guys . 
  in * slovenia ? 
  interesting , did n't know that . 
  whoa , no way . 
  her original name is still `` muslim '' , but i just do n't see why she would change it . 
  from hopeful model to this . 
  that 's crazy to me . 
   she has been shunned by the norwegian bosniak community i 'm so ok with that . 
  i 'm even kind of glad they did . 
  this kind of attire simply just is n't `` us . '', 
  you walk through any town in bosnia and it 's usually old women who wear old dresses and a hijab * at most * and nothing near , well , this . 
  yeah . 
  her name is leyla ( in bosnian it 's spelled as lejla , pronounced the same way ) and her last name is hasi\u0107 . 
  i 've never seen another bosnian muslim adopt full-on middle eastern clothing . 
  this is actually a little worrying . 
  nice . 
  nice . 
  true balkan quality . 
  surprised berlin is $ 220 billion . 
  i thought it would have been way higher . 
  * sigh *, 
  stolac is definitely in bosnia . 
  that 's a good question . 
  meaning support for ethnic entities is the same among both groups and has dropped from almost half among both groups to 33 % . 
  i 'd say that 's solid progress in their thinking . 
  serbs living in bosnia can not `` go back to serbia '' because they 're from bosnia . 
  i think you were saying they want to go back to serbia . 
  and no , you may have misread  here we have seen some important shifts in opinion . 
  fewer and fewer bosnians -- in all ethnic communities -- support exclusive ethnic territories . 
  over 43 percent of bosniaks supported ethnic separation in 2005 ; today that 's 33 , a drop of 10 percentage points . 
  among bosnian croats , support has dropped from 58 percent to roughly 40 , or 18 percentage points . 
  the decline is strongest among bosnian serbs , with a drop from 57 percent to 33 , or 24 percentage points . 
  that 's just unfair . 
  the nationalists might , and they are the tiny minority . 
  [ they do n't . 
  ] ( https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/02/20-years-after-dayton-heres-what-bosnians-think-about-being-divided-by-ethnicity/?client=safari ) they also ca n't . 
  haha , i never said they did n't support the regime . 
  all people supported all sides . 
  everyone was `` hunting '' everyone . 
  `` serbia '' did not `` dismantle '' bosnia or croatia . 
  they ca n't go back to a place they 've never been . 
  i wonder how hard it was to find a korean to serbian translator . 
  or maybe they all just spoke english . 
  so all the camps were in bosnia , not croatia proper . 
  i did n't know jasenovac was in bosnia , thanks for the geography tip . 
  we also do n't owe any kind of thanks , are you delusional ? 
  joining yugoslavia was simply the logical thing to do . 
  we had communist leadership too . 
  kama did n't number anywhere * near * what it was supposed to . 
  maybe 4-5k at best ? 
  it was supposed to have been 2 corps of men ( 20k or so ) . 
  handzar is another story however , and those guys were fucked up and i definitely do n't condone that . 
  and those serb killings by ndh were done by ndh , so i do n't think there was much bosniak involvement there . 
  take that up with the croats . 
  and so the right thing to do is kill the civilians that you want to incorporate into your multiethnic nation , correct ? 
  do n't even get me started on the \u010cetniks . 
  could n't be any farther from the truth . 
  the serb partisans in bosnia collaborated heavily with the \u010cetniks there . 
  to us it meant there was no difference because they were still killing us anyway . 
  there were still some regions where we joined the partisans though , and not for the reasons you listed . 
  there were bosniak partisans , so no , we did not lose two . 
  technically . 
  that 's like me saying you lost wwii because some serbians were \u010cetniks or nedi\u0107 followers . 
  no one got liberated by serbia , rather bosnia was liberated by partisans . 
  you must be smoking something good . 
  you implied it . 
  and exactly what relevance or usefulness is hungary tied to ? 
  at least we can into indo-european, 
  it 's a joke m8, 
  lifetime supply . 
  join my side , we have \u0107evapi and fewer cases . 
  they do n't . 
  you 're welcome . 
  it probably wo n't be useful at all , lmao . 
  but yes , learning stuff about languages is cool , unless the langauge is hungarian . 
  yeah , i 'm slowly incorporating more of it into daily conversations with my parents . 
  i hate my accent when i speak , it sounds so goofy . 
  i also feel like breathing is different just because how our languages tend to `` flow '' whereas english is kinda monotone . 
  jebi ga. 
  i can read cyrillic at like a 3rd grade level , lmao . 
  yeah , it 's really tough . 
  i grew up here in the states , so i forgot our language because i was learning english ever since i was about 4 . 
  so now the past few years , i 've been trying my best to re-learn bosnian as if it 's a foreign language , and it 's pretty tough , but i really enjoy it . 
  yeah i know what you mean , but the u in `` church '' is the closest thing to \u017ert that there is . 
  our languages are weird , lol . 
  yes but the \u017e is not the english z. 
  think the word `` mirage . '', 
  that `` ge '' in mira ** ge ** is the \u017e sound in just about all slavic languages . 
  i 'm thinking the english u that exists in `` church . '', 
  well tbh kla did n't win a single battle . 
  2070 : croatian scientists discover ftl travel and colonize half the systems in the local cluster . 
  ja sam ustvari u sad ali vidio sam ga na televiziji i na neki snimci na youtube . 
  what do you mean ? 
  dodik knows ( and has known for a long time ) he ca n't and already called it off . 
  he 's just playing the nationalism card to keep robbing serbs . 
  i do n't think denmark has any nuclear weapons .
