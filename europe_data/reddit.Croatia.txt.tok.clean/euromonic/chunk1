sorry but you guys are very similar , you 're the closest slavic countries to each other that are separated by hungary , austria and romania . 
  the biggest difference in culture that i see is you guys got the austrian part of austria-hungary and they got this weird hybrid between both . 
  it 's ok , every balkan slav gets confused with the russians . 
  even when i tell people i 'm not they always say `` ok yeah but it 's pretty similar . '', 
  i mean i guess but i 've met americans who get upset when you say that the north and the mid-west of america are almost the same thing . 
   `` i do n't have any slavic blood '' hungarian i 'm just teasing but lmao, 
   we have nothing in common with bulgaria and romania tell that to the 4-5 centuries of ottoman rule that was present in each of those countries . 
  bulgaria has more in common with albania than russia or poland in terms of cuisine , folk dance and costumes , climate and history . 
  i would place albania in southern or eastern europe . 
  to me , anything east of austria , italy and germany and south of finland is eastern europe except for greece and in some cases albania . 
  is it for the same reasons as czech and polish people ? 
  couple reasons : slovenia is slavic , slavic people are synonymous with eastern europe slovenia was communist slovenia has ethnic origins in eastern europe slovenia sounds like it borders belarus , ukraine and romania slovenia has traditions and customs that are shared with other eastern european nations that are not brought on by the influence of a foreign culture . 
  ( this is probably the biggest reason . 
  you 're eastern european because that 's who you are deep down despite centuries of austrian rule . ), 
  austria is not eastern in 99.9 % of sources . 
  geographical positioning is only a small part of it . 
  the czech republic spans the most west out of all the slavic countries , yet is still considered to be eastern european by many . 
  despite the little controversy that arose over my [ last similar post ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3innlr/regions_of_europe_according_to_wikipedia/ ) , i decided to post this anyway to get rid of any bias . 
  eurovoc is used by the european parliament , the office for official publications of the european union , the national and regional parliaments in europe , some national government departments , and european organisations . 
  this is a more `` european '' subdivision of europe . 
  it was published by various national governments of europe , each hailing from a different region of europe . 
  so hopefully it covers up any bias people felt wikipedia had . 
  this is from an official source that government organizations ( particularly the european parliament ) refer to . 
  i think it 's pretty ok . edit : just so that we 're clear , the european union considers the following : ** eastern europe ** czech republic poland slovakia slovenia/croatia albania ( do n't know how they feel about that ) ** northern europe ** the baltics ( you happy now ? ), 
   france northern europe estonia scandinavia i 'm sorry but that map is bad, 
  i disagree , and this is one reason i do n't like the map made by the u.n. 
  i look at eastern europe as a cultural religion and to some extent a linguistic region . 
  it overlaps with central european . 
  to me , all slavic countries are eastern european , romania and hungary , and to some extent albania . 
  the distinction between balkan and eastern european is also something i do n't like . 
  if someone is already placing croatia or serbia into balkan europe , i 'd rather they just place it in eastern europe . 
  again , because of cultural and linguistic reasons . 
  unless of course , if when people say `` balkan '' they think of the same culture that they do when they say `` eastern european '' . 
  for me its different . 
  for example , bulgaria is balkan in culture but many put bulgaria into eastern europe and serbia into southern europe , despite the fact that both have very similar cultures . 
  as for others , i 'm not sure if the same culture comes to mind when they say balkan and eastern european . 
   slavic country orthodox was communist has eastern european culture , religion , history , cuisine and genetics is not eastern european because was n't occupied by ussr which we were , albeit for only 3 years and they never got past belgrade . 
  despite that , its insane the amount of russian songs we translated and sang across fsfr yugoslavia . 
  plus until the mid 60s russian was pretty much the only second language you could learn in schools , especially in serbia and macedonia . 
  also when it came to russia , geography lessons would take like 3 days . 
  we might not have been under russian rule , but russian culture was not foreign across sfr yugoslavia . 
  this is my problem , i get that people classify us southern europe based on our geographical location , but that 's all the basis they have for putting us there . 
  what i do n't get is when they put us into southern europe , but bulgaria into eastern europe . 
  it 's not at all accurate to group bulgarians in with the ukrainians , but then slovenia or macedonia with the italians . 
  the only thing binding the `` southern '' european countries together on that map is climate , and even then it only applies to the eastern european countries with a coastal line ( mediterranean climate ) . 
  horrible map by the un . 
  if you put former sfr yugoslavia into southern europe , but not bulgaria , then you are incorrect . 
  disclaimer : the countries in multiple regions are described as following : switzerland : western and central europe croatia : crosses between central europe and south-eastern europe serbia : situated at the crossroads between central europe and south-eastern europe . 
   bulgaria eastern europe  serbia southern europe lol, 
  i do n't like saying it either , but that 's the way most people picture it . 
  it wo n't be like that in the next generation though , that 's for sure . 
  regardless of if you say `` east of italy/austria '' , `` used to be yugoslavia '' , '' north balkan '' or `` it 's like poland '' i 'm pretty sure [ they all picture the same thing ] ( https://abagond.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/olga.jpg?w=500 ), 
  romania is n't a slavic country . 
  with a name like slovenia i can see why . 
  you guys have the most eastern european name in the world . 
  if it 's any consolation , if i say `` used to be * yugoslavia * '' they usually counter with something like `` oh , was n't that part of russia ? '', 
  i swear that as soon as you say you 're from a slavic country people just label you as russian . 
  ooh , turns out i did write prime minister instead of president . 
  i ca n't edit it now . 
  it 's gon na have to stay there . 
  i did n't think it was that bad :(, 
  last time i checked it was in and around 12 % ? 
  a decrease from the previous 14-15 % was it ? 
  mmm not really . 
  i mean , i 'm talking about * culturally * not population wise . 
  china is surrounded ( partly , but more than bosnia is by croatia ) by russia , and there are certainly chinese people in russia and vice-versa , but they 're two different cultures . 
  i say this as a croat from bosnia . 
  of course we have commonalities with bosnia , but we really can be quite different . 
  i 'll narrow it down to north america . 
  yes , the mother was another shopper , it was an francophone family i was helping . 
  no , it was n't croatia , but i think most foreigners view croatia as `` tropical russia '' so either way , croats are usually lumped by foreigners into either poland or something eastern slavic . 
  unless those foreigners are from r/europe , in which case , they love putting croatia in as balkan and nothing else . 
  i get that , but croatia is other parts of europe too . 
  while we 're on the topic of this ... 3/4 of the places you visited are southern croatia , rijeka and zagreb are exceptions . 
  the people in zagreb are pretty fair , almost [ like this ] ( https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1379798453/640923.jpg ) . 
  however the bosniaks are the ones who take the cake , they 're the fairest , palest and the tallest . 
  not that any of it matters , but it 's just an observation i noticed . 
  as for the macedonians , can you guys understand bulgarian as well as us ? 
  are there any ' \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435 ' about the bulgarian people in macedonia ? 
  thanks , i 've always been curious about this . 
  croatian people are born white , and usually have a fair feature ( most commonly light eyes , but light hair is seen too . ), 
  the ones in island or costal croatia ( where i assumed you visited ) are exposed to much more sun and thus tan much more , which is why they look so much darker . 
  a croatian born in norway or a northern climate would be easily mistaken for a ukranian it russian , that 's the reaction i get from most people at least . 
  whatever happened to your guys ' protest ? 
  did anything end up working or are they still going on ? 
  are these ethnic macedonians ? 
  if they are , these are those are the darkest slavic people i 've seen . 
  belarus was under the mongol empire and other turkic influences for hundreds of years , yet nobody compares belarus to any asian country . 
  the baltics are protestant and catholic . 
  serbia is orthodox , like russia . 
  up until the mid 1800s , the language used in serbian liturgy was called `` russo-serbian . '', 
  during the time of ottoman rule in serbia , the serbian language was forbidden and thus russian books and literature had to be imported , influencing serbia 's art , tradition and script . 
  unlike serbia , the baltics do not have a common ethnic origin with the russians . 
  unlike serbia , the baltics have a completely different language than russian . 
  unlike serbia and russia , the baltics never experienced turkic influence , which * heavily * influenced serbian and russian culture , as well as donating loanwords to both russian and serbian . 
  i understand that people who care enough to do it , will place serbia in the balkans , however serbia and any other orthodox slav country ( even some catholic slav countries ) are more connected to russia and the stereotypical image of eastern europe than you think . 
  http://i.imgur.com/arlcj65.jpg?1 it took me 45 minutes to make that . 
  i felt the same about croatia and and bosnia . 
  i mean is n't that the first thing that pops into a person 's mind when they hear those countries ? 
  even though i agree with you , i usually like to place the balkans ( except for greece ) in eastern europe just to avoid all the specifics .
