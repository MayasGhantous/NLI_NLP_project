  when communism came to yugoslavia , religion was suppressed , not taken away . 
  therefore croatian people feel communism suppressed part of their identity in an already very nationalistically suppressed society, 
  i was n't trying to say that at all . 
  obviously i recognize that dictatorship is bad , and in certain aspects the formerly communist societies of eastern europe were dictatorships . 
  however despite all the bad , and there was a lot of it , communism also brought some good . 
  my question is , what about the bad and good that communism brought makes you feel the way you do about it . 
   moderate muslims if you visited there before the war , you would n't see any . 
  my great grandma was from herzegovina . 
  she wore a traditional skirt called a `` kotula '' and that babushka headscarf . 
  if you saw her in the city , 1945 and onwards , you would automatically recognize she was somebody from the village . 
  same with women wearing the hijab , not even the niqab , just the headscarf . 
  if you were in sarajevo anytime after 1945 and you saw a woman with a hijab , she would stand out as much as grandma did . 
  i do n't know what happened post war , but it 's definitely evident . 
  it 's so weird now to see women my grandmas age not be covered at all , yet their granddaughters wear hijabs or burqas . 
  i even recall stories my parents told me where they would serve pork at their home that the city muslims would eat . 
  now there are places in sarajevo where you ca n't even buy [ pork ] ( https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3047/2940540551_3f24838f77_b.jpg ) . 
  perhaps now bosnia will return back to its true , european lifestyle that it had during communism . 
  as somebody from sarajevo , i can say that it 's honestly disappointing to see how much more radically islamic people have become , and how bosnia appears to be turkifying itself more than ever in history . 
  i 'm not saying remove kebab , all i 'm saying is that there was definitely a change after 95 , but not even in an economic or political sense , but rather a social sense . 
  maybe it was the war , maybe it was the fall of communism , but the people of sarajevo are n't happy anymore . 
  they were truly devastated by the aftermath of the war , and now every ethnic group , serbs , muslims and croats have all just disjointed . 
  not as if they were ever strongly connected , but there is just less fluidity with everyone 's lifestyle in bosnia now . 
  it 's not ready for the eu , but if it does enter it , i hope it finds that light it lost so long ago , because that is a bosnia no foreigner is aware of , and that was the true bosnia , and i 'm so sad that now bosnia is viewed as `` small muslim/post war country in europe '' . 
  bosnia is such a beautiful country , which has indistinguishable cultural attractions , and had some of the most modern people in europe . 
  if you go to bosnia now , even in sarajevo , it is not the same . 
  interesting how 6/10 of the top smokers in the world are eastern european . 
  wonder why that is ? 
  every song by ceca , stoja , dj ( insert name here ) , or most people of their kind , produce over synthesized arabic dabke sounding hits . 
  it becomes kind of annoying hearing that on end in clubs, 
  wow i had no idea polish people had this in their language . 
  is it a word that is actually used ? 
  cuisine wise kind of , but music , folk dance and old style traditional croatia is not really balkan . 
  the only balkan that you may confuse it with is the influence of serbian and bosnian turbo folk , which severina mimics and the former yugoslavia globalized in croatia . 
  but medimurje and dimitrovgrad/vranje are two different culture spheres , js #edit : to the people downvoting this you clearly have no idea about either region . 
  [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/vuc6vwdiv1c ) are [ dances ] ( https://youtu.be/hqz6tp870fi ) from dimitrovgrad and vranje . 
  the former looks really bulgarian in nature while the latter resembles turkish/slavic muslim folk dance a lot . 
  here is a dance from [ medimurje ] ( https://youtu.be/-yziccgwvd8 ) looks a lot like hungarian/slovak does n't it ? 
  moreover the cuisine of medimurje includes [ jabucna pogaca ] ( http://pu.i.wp.pl/bloog/93638702/756341/dscf5250_21_big.jpg ) , [ gibanice ] ( http://croatiareviews.com/media/reviews/photos/original/35/a2/74/631-medimurska-gibanica-55-1438628744.jpg ) ( not the serbian kind ) , and [ krofne ] ( http://www.stvarukusa.rs/sites/default/files/styles/w685/public/recipe/photo_galleries/mekane_mini_krofne_25185229_2.jpg ) , all distinctly central/eastern european foods . 
  the cuisine of vranje or pirot contains food that resembles kosovo , albania macedonia or bulgaria ... all countries with massive turkish influence . 
  i do n't think i 've ever seen [ kebabs ] ( http://www.globeholidays.net/africa/egypt/lower_egypt/media/cairo_kebab_5.jpg ) , [ halva ] ( http://www.azerbaijancuisine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/umaj-halva.jpg ) or [ tulumba ] ( http://yalcinlarbalkantulumba.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/tulumba.png ) made in medimurje , and i guarantee it was never made there or the rest of basically any other region of croatia ever pre-sfr yugoslavia so please , do n't just assume because it was part of one country that it 's the same . 
  and definitely before you downvote something because it does n't fit your definition of what you think , educate yourself so that other people do n't have to . 
  [ well ... ... ] ( http://www.slovak-republic.org/pictures/historical-maps/great-moravia-900.png ) if north croatia and slovenia are culturally balkan then so are hungary , slovakia and moravia, 
  be happy your capital is outside the balkan curtain you russo-tiroler-schnitzels, 
  congrats hungary and ukraine !, 
  come join us while we drink sljivovica and eat corba . 
  soon you will find out that you do not differ much from balkan ... 
  silly dances_with_sloths , macedonians are slavs ... ok ... they 're slavs, 
  https://youtu.be/io2wg62tznk?t=2m46s this part looks like some serbo-croatian hybrid at weddings . 
  the thing is , the upper parts of the womens outfit , ( headscarf , blouse , vest ) is all very croatian looking , but the dress looks so [ german ] ( https://youtu.be/bq9g5zfqwei?t=35s ) . 
  ah yes of course , the three strap velcro shoe is a perfect indication of frugality and modesty what influence does this region bare ? 
  i 'm thinking something under thatcher the great, 
  for eastern europe , almost all countries had it legalized during the coming of communism in 1945 . 
  ex-soviet union a little earlier in 1917 . 
  i 'm aware they recriminalized it , but they decriminalized it before . 
  * sigh * croatia 's culture , except for a few parts , is almost entirely central european . 
  even south of the sava river , anything that is not dalmacija or istra is central european in culture . 
  i 'm so upset that just because of yugoslavia people group it in as balkan . 
  it is balkan , but if you took a look at zagreb , osijek , baranja , slavonija or most of croatia proper you would n't know because their folklore , cuisine and architecture parallels the austrian/hungarian/slovak one almost exactly . 
  wow you know i 'm shocked by the things people are saying here . 
  all year long people on this sub bitch and complain about how `` muh poland is central yurop !! 11 !, 
  ! 1 '' or `` croatia is n't eastern europe and neither is slovenia !! 11 ! '', 
  and everyone practically begs to be re-categorized into central europe . 
  yet , when i post something like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/aa/european_sub-regions_%28according_to_eurovoc%2c_the_thesaurus_of_the_eu%29.png ) ( which might i remind you serves as the official categorization of europe for the european union ) i get comments like [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3kqldd/regions_of_europe_as_defined_by_the_eurovoc_the/cuzww91 ) the amount of people on here saying that their country is eastern europe and not central is just stupid . 
  this map may have some inconsistencies , but germany was one of the key countries that influenced central european culture , and many things that are considered typically central european originated in either germany , austria or poland . 
  jesus it 's like nothing pleases you people . 
  what map can ? 
  i love posting these kinds of map because find it interesting but every time i do someone is always being a baby about it . 
  things i would fix : - southern europe france moved more south - netherlands grouped culturally ce - estonia moved into nordics - ne stretches the northern tips of germany and poland, 
  [ croatia ] ( https://youtu.be/mqozzizwm6o?t=3m3s ) is pretty central european . 
  even the [ coastal parts ] ( https://youtu.be/4qkygkyu9nw?t=9s ) have dominant central european culture in the dance and music . 
  yeah that 's a good point . 
  though estonia was for a long time under teutons and poland-lithuania . 
  maybe those account for the central european influence ? 
  stuff i 'd like to note : - croatia is entirely central europe ( which is pretty correct ) - the southern part of ukraine ( odessa ) is balkan ( crimea should be too ) - u.k is western europe i think this is the most accurate and reasonable classification yet . 
  you make sense . 
  during the tuzla uprising of 2014 , a man interviewed on the news said something along the lines of `` why is having sex in the office illegal ? 
  because it is wrong to have sex with your family ! '', 
  the girl in question was muslim from bulgaria ( pomak ? 
  i think ) . 
  it could be her just exaggerating as she is not from sofia originally . 
  to paraphrase what she said : `` yeah like when i go out in sofia , i always bring uncle/cousin because the men will just look at me and it makes me so uncomfortable '', 
  i will agree that post ww2 yugoslavia there was more balkan influence . 
  pre-communism and suppression of nationalism , northern croatia ( zagorje , slavonia ) had very similar attitudes to the czechs . 
  tito himself ( who is from north western croatia/slovenia ) even said he preferred czech immigrants to yugoslavia as they were hard workers . 
  i believe i posted things like this before to this sub : http://imgur.com/a/j9pdb ( about croatia . 
  yes i 'm aware it 's president not prime minister and 1 or two pics are inaccurate ) http://imgur.com/a/d9mwr ( croatia and other countries cultural exchange ), 
  show america you are now independent !, 
   ruled at a time yes that 's right . 
  at a time . 
  i 'm observing based on folklore and cuisine . 
  you guys are similar to us that 's a given , however when i went to the ukrainian pavillion at this culture thing we had at my work , these ukrainian ( from odessa and crimea ) had burek at their thing . 
  the music they were playing sounded like traditional makedonsko oro . 
  besides even if they had 0 contact , they were the same tribe for ages . 
  lots and lots of things have been changed or influenced , but few things do still stay the same . 
  macedonia was under turkish influence for the longest time . 
  what do you think ruled southern ukraine and russia for 300 + years ? 
  if it was n't the ottomans , it was some turkic tribe . 
  because bulgaria has also had like 0 contact with russia , serbia too . 
  yet look at their folklore and you can see how one can be very similar to the other . 
  erm , something like that but less extreme .
