  slavs have a history of being under germany , hungary and turkey so they made this movement to revive their slavic culture and stick together as they were the same people living in different lands . 
  than ussr happened as well as stalinism , and unfortunately gave socialism a bad name and made all slavic people bitter towards the idea, 
   slovenians i mean linguistically and genetically yeah , culturally they are slavic but have * extreme * austrian/german influence . 
  there are even some dialects of slovenian that pronounce the `` u '' ( `` oo sound '' ) as the german/french `` u '' . 
  cuisine and the likewise , slovenian people are really , really heavily influenced by austria . 
   bulgarians genetically not really , linguistically and culturally they ( along with serbians and macedonians ) are oriented towards southern russian/ukrainians . 
  loads of turkish influence in bulgaria , equivalent to austrian influence in slovenia , possibly even more . 
   bosnians if by bosnians you mean muslim bosnians then yes , they are linguistically and surprisingly genetically slavic as well . 
  culturally , while retaining major slavic folklore ( baba yaga ) , they are even more so influenced by turks because of their religion . 
  i do n't know , despite the fact that bosnian muslims are slavic , it 's just so hard even as a croatian from bosnia to tie islam , circumcision , allah , the hijab ( in mosques , bosniak women usually do n't wear it outside ) and slavs together . 
  like it just does n't `` fit ''  albanians no . 
  tbh for croatian people , serbia bosnia and bulgaria are where `` balkan '' begins . 
  and now for serbia bosnia and bulgaria , albania is where balkan begins . 
  in albania , well that 's kind of it . 
  yes , i agree with russian imperialism thing !, 
  i do n't care if you mix the slovak slivovica with the bosnian one and call it the same thing ( it kind of is anyway ) , but when ( usually ) russia steps foot in a slavic country and then claims something along the lines of `` let me run this because we are the same people ( which yeah we kind of are but still ) '' then it sounds kind of staliny . 
  if we 're all the same people from the same origin , why do n't we all we all work together and cooperate with each other instead of just territory hogging ? 
  of course we 're all just people and we 're all equal and the same , that 's a given . 
  however when you look at it like that it 's not funny and kind of boring . 
  so itt , it 's already established we 're all equal , but focus on the thoughts and feelings of subdivisions and communities in europe . 
  after watching many videos of slavic/central european folklore , i began to see the many cultural commonalities between croatia and it 's surrounding countries . 
  i decided to make this compilation and post it here so that r/europe could see that any division , no matter the type ( religious , geographical , magyar ) is relatively small . 
  it 's amazing to see just how undivided you really are , at least within the same cultural sphere as you lol couple of notes : this took * really * long to do and it 's only the first part . 
  inb4 the pics are awkwardly cut and some are n't 1080p . 
  yeah there are a couple reasons for that : - finding some of these pictures was really hard - sometimes a picture would appear to be really similar to a region in croatia , but for some reason i just could n't pin my finger on which region so that greatly lengthened the process - sometimes there 's a particular variant of a folk costume that i knew existed but i could n't find a picture of . 
  for example , in this part i really wanted to include [ romania ] ( http://f.tqn.com/y/goeasteurope/1/s/s/n/-/-/girls-national-romanian-folk-dress.jpg ) and [ moldova ] ( http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3336/3562238202_10090852de.jpg ) as well as other [ slovak ] ( http://vodafest.org/sites/default/files/dsc_1840_custom.jpg ) pics but i just did not know the region of croatia or its diaspora had similar outfits . 
  but i know they have something like that if anybody wants to help contribute , any pms would be greatly appreciated . 
  i used google images , wikipedia and a facebook page for the croatian costumes and mainly google images for the other ones . 
  however i can tell you right now , the facebook page for croatian folk costumes had so much more info than the google images page , so i can only imagine how many outfits i skipped out in other countries because of my limited resources . 
  thanks for any feedback and i hoped you guys enjoyed it . 
  the countries i 'm looking to do in part 2 are : serbia bosnia montenegro albania/kosova bulgaria ( if applicable ) romania moldova italy czech republic germany/austria yes it 's a lot , and with the limited options google gives you , it 's very tedious . 
  on top of that while i consider myself pretty knowledgeable on croatian folklore , i do n't know every region by heart so i may know something is similar to croatian , but i just wo n't know * to what * is it similar . 
  any help is greatly appreciated in finding resources for these countries , or if you know of any other pics i could add to this album . 
   he 's attempted to contact europeans on turks who 've spoken against him so he can punish those at home what ? 
  the wording is a little tricky here sorry . 
  let me guess , he 's right wing ? 
  ah yes , tell us again of how it was in fact the communists who killed innocent croatians who they mistakenly associated with fascists . 
  and then tell us yet again of how it was the fascists who slaughtered innocent people in jasenovac . 
  i personally have members of my family killed by the nazis and the communists , and can i just say that croatia needs to start focusing on croatia and not ndh/yugoslavia . 
  i do n't know how those who are n't too affected by its history would feel , but all i can say is while as a human it 's always sad to see someone pass , this is a day for eastern europe , particularly the balkans . 
  any remnant of the tyranny that plagued our modest peninsula for centuries has now finally gone . 
  though it 's imprint is still firmly rooted in the balkans , now the last of the ass backwards autocrats that set our countries back so many years and contributed to or endorsed the dividing , raping , murdering , and slaughtering of our populations , is dead . 
  and with him the last living symbol of the despot empire . 
  our grandma 's are the ex-commie police,

  oh my god that is the most eastern european thing i have ever seen . 
  reminds me of 1984 . 
  ancient macedonians are unrelated to and have nothign to do with modern slav macedonians other than the fact that present day macedonia overlaps with ancient macedonia, 
  in terms of syntax , stress , and lexis . 
  while the other languages would be able to master russian faster , macedonians understand the fastest off the bat . 
  should hae clarified that, 
  i 'm not too familiar , but i believe in school for a limited amount of time serbo-croatian speakers would have about 20 minutes a day dedicated to syntax and grammar of macedonian and slovenian , as the lexis and stress of the languages was similar enough to get by without education . 
  i think it was the same in slovenia and macedonia as well . 
  though despite being in the same country , aside from a couple of culinary traits and jokes , slovenia and macedonia shared little relationships with each other . 
  their culture , history , mentality are as different as germany and bulgarias . 
  russian was mandatory in yugoslavia until 1948 , where after it was n't mandatory but was still one of the only secoond languages availible to learn in schools ( until about the mid 60s ) while slovenia , croatia and bosnia mainly took to learn english and german , montengro , serbia and especially macedonia stuck with russian . 
  this is for a couple reasons : - macedonian is the closest language to russian out of all official laguages of yugoslavia - macedonia exclusively used the cyrillic script - virtually every macedonian knew how to speak serbo-croatian and understood bulgarian , further making it easier for them to adapt - macedonians are slav orthodox people as russians are , providing cultural similarties and familiarizing the langauge through culture . 
  likewise , macedonia was given special attention in this case .

  abortion was legal all up until ' 66 , at which point it became not illegal , but restricted . 
  indeed , abortion was allowed to women whose fetus was malformed , was the product of rape or incest , or if the mothers life was in danger . 
  in addition , on demand abortion was legal if the woman had had more than 3 kids or was over 40 . 
  well in any other circumstance you 'd be right , but it 's in those specific circumstances that they would * not * be punished .

  meh , there also was period for 20 years when homosexuality was legal and you could serve as an openly gay politician or be an openly gay [ media personality ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/georgy_chicherin ) , yet i do n't think many would jump to the fact that the ex-soviet union was a bastion for gay rights . 
  gay was more or less shoved under the mat in communism , never openly discussed yet suspects were tolerated within individual communities . 
  same with abortion , except abortion was far less taboo and would actually be talked about in society, 
  wow , thanks soviet union . 
  there 's one we never thought we 'd say amiright comrades, 
  croat here .
