  i 'd say slovenia or hungary , maybe even slovakia or austria . 
  probably because of cuisine and folklore . 
  plus they all have that dance move where the people run underneath the handkerchiefs . 
  where i live , when i tell people i 'm croatian , they automatically say something along the lines of `` oh , that 's like polish right ? '', 
  if not poland than they 'll say something like `` oh , you 're croatian ?!, 
  i have a serbian friend , his/her name is _______ '' i guess this one pertains more to the lesser known countries , since most people are very informed of the more `` famous '' countries , like italy or france : s, 
  mine would be `` used to be yugoslavia '' which is followed by a look of clarity from the confused stranger . 
  if they do n't know what that country was , i go with `` it 's like poland '' or `` it 's to the right of italy '' and then they get the picture . 
  tfw most of western europe ca n't participate in this thread . 
  [ mine ] ( http://www.croatiaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/splitskidir_facebook.jpg ) - mayor with meat on head - beer in hand - accordion in the background - dress/track suit combination not saying it 's bad , i found it quite amusing . 
  however it is a picture that summarizes my country and its people . 
  people are n't too aware of my country on any side , so i tell them to guess where i 'm from . 
  from most to least common i usually get : - ukrainian - polish - russian - italian ( this one was the rarest , i 've only gotten like 2 guesses with this one ) i 've heard some exceptional guesses , like swedish ( height i 'm guessing ) and portuguese ( body hair i 'm guessing . ), 
  so post what other ethnicity people though you were throughout life , it 's nice to see what everyone else thinks of the europeans . 
  croat here . 
  before i say anything i just wan na say that there 's a reason why communism fell and capitalism is still standing . 
  my goal here is not to be anti-capitalist . 
  however , though i personally did n't live there , communism in yugoslavia seemed relatively ok . lots of social liberties , socialized services , education and healthcare , high literacy rate and everyone was entitled to the same political and legal rights . 
  that 's not to say there was n't a downside , as nationalism was heavily suppressed in a country with multiple nations and traditional religions . 
  of course , there is the obvious restriction of political speech and the obligation of complying to the government regardless if the people disagree with them or not . 
  so there downsides to it as well . 
  overall though , i 'd say it does n't appear to be all that bad . 
  far from perfect but not bad . 
  there are a lot of polish and croatians people where i live who say they do not like communism . 
  on top of that , from what i hear from r/europe , neither do a lot of other eastern europeans . 
  what is the reason for this ? 
  was it because communism separated the church and state and polish people are very catholic ? 
  was it because eastern europe ( save yugoslavia , although it too experienced it more or less indirectly ) was under soviet influence ? 
  it 's completely understandable these factors would put you off from communism , but i 'm just asking if those are all the reasons why . 
  edit : i should 've reworded my question . 
  i was referring to the formerly socialist states of eastern europe that called themselves communist . 
  communism never existed in real life ever . 
  in other words , how do others who do n't speak your language , think it sounds like ? 
  for me , i constantly get polish . 
  i 'd say 95 % of the time people guess i 'm speaking polish , and the other 5 % is split between ukrainian/russian or the rare italian . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkgkzzwutgy ) is croatian being spoken . 
  would you have guessed if you were n't told ? 
  so , what language do foreigners think you speak , as opposed to what language you really speak ? 
  srry france , italy , spain and germany , you ca n't really partcipate :( my personal opinions : sounds like russian : romanian , portuguese , albanian , lithuanian , latvian sounds like spanish : greek sounds like german : czech , rarely polish sounds like finnish : hungarian , estonian, 
  edit : added some stuff edit # 2 : it seems i 'm not making myself clear , so i 'll quote an earlier comment . 
   the point was n't to highlight how good communism was , it was to highlight how many drastically positive changes were made transitioning into communism and how generations were brought up in that kind of atmosphere . 
  the question is why has n't that atmosphere of sudden progression to economical and social aspects of life continued in ee alright , i posted a thread kind of similar to this one a while back . 
  i wanted to post this thread after [ this timeline ] ( http://i.imgur.com/eymt3hw.gif ) was posted to r/europe but i forgot . 
  it was the communist jokes thread that reminded me . 
  concerning just that timeline alone ( although that 's not the main focus , just something that pushed me to write this ) , i commented this on the original reddit post . 
   what surprises me is eastern europe . 
  believe it or not eastern europe had permissive laws concerning homosexuality as early as the 1910s . 
  it surprises me that in places where homosexual and heterosexual relationships were `` considered equal in the eyes of the law '' ( vladimir lenins words , and indirectly the words of all the former communist countries of europe ) have such a large opposition to something that was almost legal back in communism . 
  though frowned upon ( very frowned upon ) , it was legally better to be gay in the 1940s in any communist eastern european country than it was to be in almost any other country anywhere . 
  why eastern europe is the way it is , i 'm not sure , we really are a weird people . 
   edit : clarification homosexuality was legal . 
  homosexual marriage was just shy of being legal so basically that ties into my bigger question of why ? 
  all formerly communist states of eastern europe ( from czech republic/slovenia to russia ) seem to be relatively conservative and right wing , sometimes both economically and socially ( russia 's authoritarianism , poland 's healthcare , serbia 's gun laws etc. . . ) . 
  however it seems as this would be almost the exact opposite expected behavior from formerly socialist countries . 
  of course everyone can pick out the bad of communist times , some of which were highlighted in the aforementioned [ communist jokes thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/45o5p5/czechoslovak_jokes_about_the_communist_regime/ ) , however surely no one would reject the few good things it brought . 
  gender and racial equality was present , university tuition was nationalized , health and dental care were priorities ( and it too , was nationalized ) * almost * everyone had a home ( albeit in things like [ these ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_becljms84ng/syma-t2hzki/aaaaaaaabts/2meiu0fgrc8/s400/ist-kapija-bg---konjarnik.jpg ) ) and the rent paid within those apartments was more symbolic than anything . 
  women had 1 full year paid maternity leave with at least 70 % of their pay ( source : family lived in yugoslavia ) , you had unlimited sick days and at ~ one month of full paid vacation . 
  the gap between the rich and the poor was * exponentially * less evident , which helped augment the social atmosphere , as people are ultimately more divided by class than nationality . 
  even if all of that was n't there , communist mottos included stuff like `` brotherhood and unity '' . 
  the `` why '' question means : if eastern europe was conditioned into these `` social '' conditions for so long , why has it been making `` regressions '' so to speak . 
  i 'm not talking about regressions in foreign relations , trade , or economy , obviously those have changed . 
  however , all the stuff that i mentioned above is considered `` good '' ; so in transitioning out of communism , why did n't eastern europe dump all the authoritarianism away , and keep the things that worked ? 
  western and northern europe are definitely in most cases , social democracies . 
  i really envy their qualities of life ( * especially * scandinavia 's ) . 
  however , we eastern europeans are a people who come from a socialist background , so why is eastern europe in such a bad state ? 
  if we could have nationalized tuition , full gender equality ( equal pay for equal work , whcih still does n't happen in the most developped nations to this day ) health services , rent etc. . . in those former communist days , what 's stopping us from introducing those changes now ? 
  is it because we 're conservative , or is it a fear of communism ? 
  yes of course , it 's stupid , yes of course , it 's a huge exaggeration and of course it does n't nearly apply to everyone , however i kind of like it when people label my country as stoic , apathetic , hardcore eastern europeans that still have that ex-communist discipline and think that this whole `` sensitive , sissy , hipster culture '' is all a crock of horse crap ... because you know , it shows that we are stronk i guess a positive stereotype would be the fact that we have a beautiful country , but imo every country has `` beauty '' so it 's not that special . 
  so europe , what stereotypes about your country do you secretly enjoy , but would never admit to foreigners ? 
  [ removed ], 
  when you hear about other slavic countries , do you automatically think `` oh those are our people '' or do you not care ? 
  i know that in bosnia , we had a influx of ukrainians during the time of yugoslavia ( old yugoslavia , pre-communism ) . 
  i remember hearing ukrainian people speaking to each other when i was younger and thought `` why are these people speaking croatian so weird '' . 
  i thought i 'd ask to see how the situation sits in europe between slavs . 
  is pan-slavism still a thing ? 
  by contrast , how do you non-slavic europeans feel about slavic people ? 
  do you group us all in the same category , ( e.g `` oh , serbian people , goddamn ruskies '' ) or are we different to you ? 
  do you feel like we are all in our little gang or do you feel like we 're just the ex-communist rubble of eastern europe ? 
  nice break in conversation topics from the hitler-merkel newspaper parody thing . 
  #edit : to all the people bringing up ussr , i think the idea of pan-slavism was heavily incorporated into every slavic eastern european country . 
  for example , one of the most widely-sung songs in sfr yugoslavia , [ `` uz mar\u0161ala tita ( with marshal tito ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1yzxsspotm ) , contains the following lyrics ( transliterated to cyrillic because in the mood of the thread why not ) : `` rod prastari svi smo , a goti mi nismo slavenstva smo drevnoga \u010dest \u0420\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e \u0410 \u0413\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0438\u0441\u043c\u043e \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u043c\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0430 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442 '' which means `` we are all of an ancient kindred , but goths we are not . 
  we hail from an ancient slavdom '' talk about [ anti-facism ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4l3gmg/surprising_folklore_similarities_between_croatia/ ) #edit # 2 : [ a map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/slaviceurope.png ) for the uninformed, 
  croat here . 
  croatia 's geographical beauty may be highlighted in its coast , but it 's folkloric treasures are definitely found in the north : [ baranja ] ( http://i.imgur.com/m50scgj.jpg ) definitely sticks out , it was under hungarian influence for a long time so it resembles its eastern european neighbors ( romania , slovakia , western ukraine ) . 
  lots of detail and full of color [ zagorje ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5j06q9g.jpg ) is another one . 
  throughout history this was tossed around between austrian and hungarian rule , prompting for a very `` central '' european look . 
  this last one is technically cheating , but by far the most captivating folk outfits of the croatians are from the ones who [ live in ] ( http://i.imgur.com/4xf9hgu.jpg ) [ slovakia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7grpxig.jpg ) . 
  these are croatians who escaped from the turks during ottoman rule and fled to slovakia ... which was later annexed by the turks . 
  there are historical populations of croats in hungary , serbia , romania , slovakia , the czech republic , bosnia , austria , montenegro , kosovo and italy . 
  a modern folk outfit that is still worn even to this day ( mostly by croats from bosnia ) can be seen [ throughout the streets , worn by young and old ] ( http://i.imgur.com/evxerof.jpg ) bonus : cuz i like the [ boots ] ( http://i.imgur.com/dox48js.jpg ) this is from podravina , which was also under hungary for a long time . 
  we have [ better red boots ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ashc0ee.jpg ) but i ca n't find a good picture where they wear solid colored ones . 
  croatia has beautiful coasts with a classy , mediterranean cuisine to munch in while you tour the coast line in a boat . 
  i 'm very glad this has been extensively highlighted in media . 
  but croatia also has some really cool historic architecture , like its [ castles ] ( http://citypal.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/veliki-tabor-4.jpg ) that are located [ in ] ( http://kamauf-zagreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trakoscan2.jpg ) the [ north ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/castle_donji_miholjac.jpg ) , which you can enjoy watching while eating your nice [ austro-hungarian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/palatschinke.jpg ) [ cuisine ] ( http://recepti.fr/slike/201005031405570.buhtle.jpg ) the sea and islands are nice but more often than not croatia is viewed by foreigners ( especially from north america , most of whom know very little about eastern europe in general ) as a continuation of italy , because of extensive exposure to the coasts . 
  also , croatia should not be lumped into [ balkan ] ( https://youtu.be/cr1xng9kyii?t=2m20s ) turbo folk . 
  i for one at least , do not like the pervasive turkish/eastern influence that is somehow becoming more and more present in [ most notably ] ex-yugoslavia ( not slovenia but especially serbia/bosnia ) , bulgaria , albania etc. . . 
  it can be catchy sometimes but most times it just ends up looking like [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/74aeien0ysc?t=1m17s ) while we do have modern music in croatia , when thinking of the `` cultural idenity '' of a country , i 'd like to draw more attention to our [ northern ] ( https://youtu.be/am9cmgw13na?t=1h6m59s ) music , with instruments other than the [ tamburica ] ( https://youtu.be/7c7ocf2641o?t=10m57s ) edit : forgot some very important [ attractions ] ( http://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/rocket-zagreb-communist.jpg?42b3f7 ) for our [ tourists to see ] ( http://cdn.yomadic.com/wp-content/uploads/communist-rocket-zagreb.jpg?42b3f7 ), 
  i 've talked about this before on this sub , and i was met with some hostility from people . 
  ex-yugoslavs are welcome to chime in here too . 
  of course communism was a totalitarian evil imposed from the outside .
