  of course it severely restricted political freedom . 
  of course it lowered quality of life compared to western europe . 
  however , i simply can not imagine it as the inhuman brutal despot time people make it out to be . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , life in eastern europe was a political and economic hindrance , but people lived similar to those in the west . 
  many ex-yugoslavs adore communism because ours was run independently rather than through the soviet union , so maybe i 'm being biased here . 
  aside from albania and maybe romania , communism in the eastern bloc did n't really seem all too bad , but then again i never lived through it . 
  which is why i 'm asking people who did live through it to share their honest opinions . 
  i do n't expect to get much here , as i 'm more than certain that the people with positive or semi positive opinions about communism will keep to themselves at risk of being torn apart by the anti-communists of their country who have personal anecdotes about how their uncle/sister/grandpa was held hostage for x amount of years because they talked favourably about their pre-communist country . 
  which do n't get me wrong , that happened to people i know personally from yugoslavia . 
  still awful , still bad . 
  so i guess any answer coupled with an explanation would help me to get a better feeling with this subject . 
  #edit : many people are bringing up the nepotism and `` knowing the right people '' card . 
  as someone who 's family hails from ex-yu , i can not agree more on this term . 
  absolutely this is a huge problem that plagues all of eastern europe to this day . 
  #likewise , all these punishments i 'm hearing about people getting executed for listening to free-radio ... it just seems a bit much . 
  my dads and moms uncles were both killed in the `` kri\u017eni put '' from austria . 
  the reason ? 
  they were croatian and croatians post ww2 were associated with the usta\u0161e - fascists . 
  i have friends who 's parents were political prisoners and there are numerous examples of tito removing serbian and croatian singers because they mentioned the words `` serbia '' or `` croatia '' in their song . 
  #i find it hard to believe that such harsh punishments for such little political dissent were so actively enforced to such a large number of people . 
  i feel that most never had a problem with this and would go as far to say that members of society could even interact with each other and speak negatively about the government with people who you knew . 
  in bosnia , everyone smokes , or at least they used to . 
  it 's very ingrained in the culture and few bat an eye to it . 
  in croatia , a country that has westernized itself a bit more since communism , there 's a huge amount of parents and grandparents who smoke but fewer in the young generation . 
  1/4 croats die from smoking , do n't know what the statistic is for bosnia . 
  none at all . 
  maltese is in the same language group as arabic , but it was completely isolated from arabic and heavily influenced by italian . 
  an italian might understand a loan word here or there , like how a bulgarian might understand a turk , and an arab might understand the odd sentence or expression , like a french and italian . 
  legalized in the early 1950s when the communists came , never really made illegal after that and it sort of just became part of society . 
  so there really is n't a stance i 'd say , people just do it or they do n't do it . 
  i 'd say that by society and mentality , saudi arabia . 
  women became equal to men in croatia in the 1940s , while women there are forced to cover themselves up and be slaves to men . 
  they are n't allowed to drink alcohol , and women there can be charged with prostitution for talking to a man who is n't directly related to them . 
  culturally i 'd say india/indian culture sphere . 
  so much difference in the food ( so much ) , mentality , religion , population , geography , music , history ... not that it 's bad but it 's just so different . 
  lot of the eastern european outfits are appealing .

  i think that [ belarus ] ( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3egkgbjqm6k/uio2kiamjdi/aaaaaaaae6u/qchpkivhkp4/s1600/belarus+mogilew+museum2.jpg ) has amzing embroidery and although some say [ this ] ( http://i0.wp.com/www.thelovelyplanet.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/serbian-folklore-dancers-duque%c4%b1ros.jpg ) is a serbian folk outfit , i 'm not quite sure . 
  it even has its own [ choreography ] ( https://youtu.be/0olhj3yu90o?t=12s ), 
  woah that map is way wrong . 
  i ca n't speak for every cultural region , but grouping non-coastal slovenia and croatia , as well as anything north of dalmatia in as adriatica is kind of wrong . 
  those regions were for a very long time under austria , hungary , or both . 
  zagreb was at one point under moravians . 
  that being said , herzegovina is a mish-mash between the culture of germany , slovakia , hungary , and turkey as well as some italy . 
  generally , to the rest of the world we 're lumped in with balkans or more broadly the `` russian '' people , but we probably most strongly identify with ex-yugoslav culture ( no surprise there ), 
  `` oh you mean like poland . 
  ok , i know where you 're from now . '', 
  well ... you kind of are . 
  prekmurje and bratislava have a lot in common with each other . 
  but there are in fact not one but two macedonian flairs silly :, 
  i view turks to arabs the same way people everywhere in the world view ukrainians to serbians, 
  could just be because everyone smokes and sends their kids to school with a cauldron full of moussaka . 
  `` what you mean you no hungry !? 
  eat !! '', 
  used to be 10 , now with tourism an 8 . 
  usually people lump it into one of two categories : used to be yugoslavia/war or `` oh you mean like poland/serbia '', 
  cabbage beans pickled peppers pickled cabbage ( winter time , [ including the sliced up version , like sauerkraut ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/cavolo_salato.jpg ) ) potatoes [ this gross kale stuff ] ( http://cdn.coolinarika.net/image/573f832cab1bf9a9a39d42ee348bcb13_header.jpg?v=3 ) [ this gross cabbage stuff ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/silvestrovska_kapustnica.jpg ) this type of [ plate ] ( http://oi40.tinypic.com/xby6nm.jpg ) you can see every time you go over to a another persons house or for a celebration of any kind . 
  it 's just like the thing that every croatian does idk . 
  we eat bread with everything , and we make special kinds for [ christmas ] ( http://www.thefreshloaf.com//files/u39313/1_8.jpg ) and for fun , we can make [ poga\u010da ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3a3l34v3ft8/maxresdefault.jpg ), 
  just turkey and albania . 
  even those two are n't that dangerous , but you are more likely to get harassed or feel uncomfortable there . 
  otherwise europe is pretty safe . 
  edit : however , the capital and larger cities of the aforementioned should be just fine , not much need to worry . 
   europe  pets i 'm pretty sure people are okay with them , but i 'm even more sure they are waaaaaay less appreciated than they are in america, 
  i have n't seen a lot of that from europeans but mostly americans . 
  they are usually the first to say they are american and nothing else . 
  my guess when europeans say it is because the american people usually only pass on the genetics of their culture and that 's it . 
  multiculturalism is easily glossed over in the states , so even 1st generation immigrants who emigrate from their country at the age of 10 end up forgetting to speak their native tongue . 
  therefore when you hear someone saying they 're `` 100 % italian baby '' , you can see why it would be annoying to the person who 's actually 100 % italian . 
   romania  not balkan romanian music cuisine and history are like iconically balkan . 
  besides here 's a [ map ] ( http://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/7/7f/balkans_regions_map.png/350px-balkans_regions_map.png ) , there are hundreds like it, 
  all slavic countries plus hungary and romania , as well as albania in some cases . 
  there are subdivisions of eastern europe : central , balkan and ex-soviet . 
  central is all the western counties of eastern europe , so all countries west of ukraine . 
  balkan is all countries that are south of ukraine , except slovenia and croatia in some cases . 
  ex-soviet is self explanatory . 
  #edit : honestly people why all the downvotes ? 
  what is wrong about this definition ? 
  sorry , i meant kids as in `` kids of parents '' . 
  but i am well aware that kids drinking is a no no, 
  ... what the hell are you talking about ? 
  in france , it is custom to give the kids a little wine with christmas dinner , or even for a night out . 
  in eastern europe , we have a drink called `` shlivovitza '' and we offer it to teens on special occasions . 
  though i suppose all of these people are `` crazy-shit drunks '' whose intent it is to create alcoholics of and physically harm their kin and future generations . 
  and i also suppose that these same people are drunk 24/7 as their judgement is clearly `` clouded '' on any given occasion . 
  also , `` drunk is an excuse '' is n't popular in europe . 
  if you 're incapacitated that 's different , but europeans usually wo n't get drunk ( e.g have a few drinks ) and then consider themselves feeble and incapable . 
  they 're drunk and not dead , they accept responsibility for their actions as drinking has been part of their culture for millennia and likewise would offer you sober or drunk . 
   underage this is a no-no in europe . 
  the united states is light years behind when it comes to alcohol laws . 
  if a european offers you a shot ( or even better , a beer ) and you are 15 ( 14 in some cases , depending on how big you are ) or over , just take it . 
  do n't bring any of that american `` am i old enough '' to europe . 
  if they offer you , you are old enough . 
  edit : by kids i meant `` children of parents '' , not actual kids . 
  that is a no no everywhere . 
  [ do n't mean to steal your thunder ... ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4mjtv0/slavic_countries_of_europe_how_do_you_feel_about/ ), 
  croatian french english i can speak a little bit of polish and italian , but only minor sentences , just enough to scrape by . 
  i 'd like to learn russian , german and continue with polish and italian, 
  he 's coming back to reclaim the territory that slipped away oh so many years ago, 
  not really eastern bloc ( at least not since 48 ) , but it 's actually kind of funny .
