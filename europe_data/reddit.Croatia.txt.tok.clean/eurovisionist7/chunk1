maraaya was amazing , one of the best slovenia has ever sent, 
  and the uk is not ? 
  for me there is ` why slovakia did n't recognize kosovo ', 
  they are pretty similar . 
  those who can afford to come are usually much wealthier than an average citizen of their country . 
  they are good spenders because if they have money , they like to make sure everyone knows it . 
  i voted based on what i think would be the best for my country , without it being a threat for the rest of the eu . 
  ukrainian and eastern european tourists in general are good spenders and it 's a pity for croatia that many of them decide to go somewhere else where they do n't need a visa . 
  turkey is too dangerous now imo and i do n't see how the eu can profit from abolishing the visas for kosovo and georgia . 
  ukraine - yes rest - no, 
  hrrrrrr !, 
  that 's why !, 
  [ news bar ] ( http://www.news-bar.hr/ ) and [ sprdex ] ( http://sprdex.net.hr/ ), 
  i texted this to my serbian friends 30 minutes ago ... how fucking croatian of me . 
  for us it 's just another labour day that decided to fall on a weekend ... 
  it 's their [ biggest fear ] ( http://imgur.com/oc2skbq ), 
  i think it 's more likely slavic because croats originate from today 's poland/ukraine, 
  croats are crazy . 
  seems like we were very violent to other tribes when we came to today 's croatia in the 7th century since it does n't appear we made love with them that often . 
  edit : sorry , just saw your flag . 
  i wanted to say , we were very nice to the tribes who used to live in today 's croatia and we civilly asked them to go to today 's albania , 
  our nationalists often try to convince us that we 're iranian , just so that we would n't be related to serbs . 
  yet , we are more slavic than the serbs themselves . 
  i see . . because they are not from southern dalmatia . 
  it says on that link that slavic for north is white . 
  makes more sense now . 
  since it also says that slavic south was black , i think croats might have changed that since soil in southern croatia is [ red ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5ghv4do.jpg?1 ), 
  ` white ' was most probably used as orientation . 
  for expample , in 13th century in the balkan area there was white croatia ( western croatia ) and red croatia ( southern croatia , ? it could be because of red soil ? 
  i 'm not saying djb is like most . 
  i do n't know anything about them . 
  the majority of most 's members were from southern dalmatia , many of them used to be members of some extremely catholic parties fighting for catholic values in croatia . 
  most was just a mask for them , even though people knew who they were . 
  they were never the good guys . 
  they were always populists , people are just naive and easy to fuck over . 
  i voted for mirela holy . 
  if everyone voted for her , today we would be smoking weed and not care about politics . 
  dissatisfied with 48 % ?!, 
  what would he be satisfied with ? 
  it has nothing to do with physical characteristics . 
  similarly , today you have belarus ( white russia ) and russia . 
   possibly because the serbians , croats , bosnians and what not were still one people they probably were , since even today they are genetically almost identical . 
  but even in their proto-states ( in today 's poland and ukraine ) they were called white croats and white serbs . 
  do n't worry , [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/5qeap5k.jpg ) is her husband , so she has a pretty high tolerance . 
  just adopt us and give us monies you do n't need war, 
  you ca n't into central europe , slovenia .

  island of bra\u010d [ 2 days ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qorlr_xq6fy ) climate change is a lie !, 
  everything 's going to be okay , [ do n't cry ] ( http://img.pandawhale.com/97505-benedict-cumberbatch-comfort-g-0ihi.gif ) , 
  our flag is a bit of a mess and there were stories that it should be changed , perhaps to something like [ this ] ( http://fama.com.hr/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boris-ljubi%c4%8di%c4%87-hrvatska-zastava.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/zastava_ljubicic_fejsdozvola3.jpg ) . 
  but it 's impossible for now because our right-wing block would immediately declare anyone who suggests that a hater of croatia and a non-patriot , a serbophile . 
  lol . 
  supporting neighbours is an obligation at the eurovision . 
  i remember when we were declared backstabbers and traitors when we gave ` only ' 7 points to bosnia & herzegovina in 2011 . 
  have you european traitors ( eurovision haters ) ever heard of [ fun ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fun ) ? 
  still better than super bowl,

  what do you mean you doubt anyone would cry over being excluded from esc ? 
  200 million, 
   economic issues are relatively unimportant in determining who is who - its either you 're for the partisan struggle , or you 're against it . 
  i did n't even know you had this in slovenia , too . 
  i thought this was only croatia 's curse . 
  you do know that was [ a serb ] ( http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2016&amp;mm=04&amp;dd=18&amp;nav_category=167&amp;nav_id=1121208 ) lol ?

  opera ` nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 zrinski ' , more famously [ the finale ' u boj , u boj ' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu9yeadvccm ) . 
  it 's about a croatian nobleman and general in habsburg monarchy . 
  story : * in 1566 , from august 5 to september 7 , his small force ( 2,300 soldiers ) heroically defended the little fortress of szigetv\u00e1r against the whole ottoman host ( 102,000 soldiers ) , led by suleiman the magnificent in person . 
  after over a month of exhausting and bloody struggle the few remaining defenders retreated into the old town for their last stand . 
  the sultan tried to entice zrinski to surrender , ultimately offering him leadership of croatia under ottoman influence , count zrinski did not reply and continued to fight . 
  the siege of szigetv\u00e1r ended with zrinski perishing with every member of the garrison in a last desperate sortie . 
  suleiman the magnificent had died by celebral hemorrhage 1 day before ottoman won the war *, 
  it 's also very popular in southern croatia , it 's called ` bo\u0107anje ' here, 
  what about a nun singing [ like a virgin ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0e8uve7cju ) by madonna or [ livin ' on a prayer ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysc16v1elds ) by bon jovi ?
