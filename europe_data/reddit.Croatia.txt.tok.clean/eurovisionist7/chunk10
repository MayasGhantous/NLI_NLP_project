  and romania . 
  there should be a titanic 2 about croatian economy, 
  all of our supermarket ajvars are dark red and sour . 
  i do n't know what we 're doing wrong , i 've never seen a nice orange one ... 
  yeah , slovenians still do things like this often :p ( but we do it , too ), 
  how do we know all this ? 
  it kills the enemies by flying into them . 
  or by exploding in midair and then the debris kills the enemies . 
  yes , a lot of them came here during the habsburg empire , but most of them have assimilated . 
  minority voters are offered to choose one between two ballot papers when they arrive to the polling place . 
  one is a regular ballot with all the lists except for the minorities lists , the other one only has their minority lists . 
  the number of seats is specific for each minority/minority group ( i.e. , serbian minority has 3 seats , czech and slovak minorities have one seat together and they share their representative ) . 
  it 's not that good of an idea because rarely anyone votes with that special ballot and those people from the lists then enter the parliament with a very low number of votes , but often decide on the government . 
  in croatia , there are 8 guaranteed seats for the minorities . 
  so they need 0 votes to become mps . 
  we are expecting a video . 
   votes of ethnic minorities , particularly croats , are `` worth '' a lot more than votes of other citizens . 
  how and why ?

  [ tornjak ] ( http://poskok.info/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tornjak-babanovac.jpg ) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tornjak, 
  haha that 's so cool , it looks like a mop, 
  i do n't get this . 
  does it have anything to do with the microphones ? 
  [ you asked for it ] ( https://youtu.be/rzxybz_sdye?t=35 ), 
  okay , i agree , we are better . 
  than serbia . 
  you have the right on your opinion , but you should really stop being balkan and start talking civilly . 
  ^ ^ ^ hihi ^ ^ ^ never ^ ^ ^ gon na ^ ^ ^ admit ^ ^ ^ it, 
  being better than croatia or slovenia is n't really an achievement , our common goal that we should work on is to be better or equal to denmark , sweden , ireland , ... 
  croats and slovenians are both known to be jealous people . 
  it 's probably under '' foreign stuff '',

  sure , but it 's virtually impossible for something like that to happen . 
  the eu would put sanctions on that member , so they would either change their politics or withdraw from the union themselves . 
  if nothing of that happens , only then would the eu try to change the legislation . 
  what i 'm saying is that it would be ridiculous if we kicked out a founding member of the eu . 
  but , no , we ca n't kick anyone out . 
  our ex-pm called him '' the dictator '' haha, 
  i like it when the eastern european ^ ^ ^ central ^ ^ ^ european countries talk how miserable the eu is making us , though . 
  i mean , it 's so difficult to withdraw all that money from the eu funds ... 
  how do you know that ? 
  that 's not kicking out , that 's a withdrawal . 
  because the legislation does not allow it . . 
  you ca n't kick any country out of the eu . 
  you ca n't kick a founding member of the eu out of the eu, 
  zagreb is dead compared to , e.g. , belgrade or thessaloniki , but they 're not even on the list . 
   nightlife  zagreb lol, 
   big blue square : christ-democrats , conservatives , national-conservatices ** ( like pis in poland ) ** more like civic platform in poland  little red square : zivi zid ( eng . 
  `` living wall '' ) left wing populists / ** communists ** communists ?!, 
  they are like something between m5s in italy and ukip, 
  what is the difference between a serb and a montenegrin ? 
  edit : still waiting for the punchline ... 
  [ give back !!!, 
  no , [ dubrovnik republic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_ragusa ) sold that territory to the ottomans because they did n't want to border venice . 
  by doing this , dubrovnik secured itself from venice trying to conquer them . 
  i ca n't hear anything, 
  pretty much explains why croatia has such a weird shape . 
  pre-christian slavic names are among the most common ones , i.e. 
   but a good sea fish is expensive there is no bad fish , at least not as bad as pork is . 
  and you can find fish for 4 $ per kg . 
  half of the croats , ~ 2,000,000 , live in [ this area ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/north_croatia.svg/2000px-north_croatia.svg.png ) you linked slavonia , where a fifth of the population lives . 
  yeah , the eu average is 21 kg of fish per year , per capita . 
  we are among the lowest consumers and eat only 8,5 kg per year . 
  because of fish ? 
  we have sea access but we export our fish to japan because croats like their pigs more ... also , if fish and meat are the same price per kilogram , most people will buy meat because they believe they are getting more for the same money . 
  fish is a necessary evil that they have to eat once a week . 
  is n't the black sea warm enough ? 
  and why is your rate so high ? 
  getting tired of lying in bed all the time ? 
  so m\u00fcnchen is monaco of bavaria ? 
  i think ceca is very trashy . 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coxrfxqj_kg ) was very popular here , though . 
  seriously , ceca does not fall under crap category ? 
  are you a bosnian spy or something ? 
  it 's a serbian name, 
  yes . 
  serbia claims that the border is following the flow of danube , but croatia claims that the flow has changed over the years . 
  with montenegro , it 's a dispute over a small peninsula . 
   we are the switzerland of balkan !, 
  the scale was pretty low, 
   i hope serbia does n't join soon ... then we wo n't even be very good at being the poorest . 
  serbia , montenegro ... 
  both expected to join soon . 
  both have border disputes with us , so it probably wo n't be that soon . 
   i would get used to becoming the 2nd poorest country in eu [ hopefully ] ( http://i.imgur.com/iornpqg.gif ) serbia will join the eu by then  but only when considering ppp ha !, 
  does n't count .

  our gdp just grew by 2,8 % , we 're not going to surrender that easily !, 
  hold it . 
  not just yet . 
  i had a small heart attack because of that title, 
  it 's not a shitstorm . 
  you guys are too sensitive , i do n't get how anyone could assume we were being serious . 
  stop lying , serbo '' slav '' is the son of turk . 
  he has a sister who hates him , alba . 
  he only has two sons , sljadoljed , whom he hates , and kara\u00e7i\u00e7 , whom he adores . 
  '' vila '' is a word for a fairy in modern croatian , but they mentioned in the text that the fairies ( plural : vile ) from the cave accepted their namesake vilina . 
  i do n't understand it completely , but vilina is probably a name derived from the croatian '' vila '', 
  in this particular legend it 's about croatia around [ krapina ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/krapina ), 
  we learned that this was before a roman province called illyria , settled by the illyrians and other tribes .
