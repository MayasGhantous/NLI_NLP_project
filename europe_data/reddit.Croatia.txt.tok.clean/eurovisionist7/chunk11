  when the slavs came , some illyrians escaped to the south and some mixed with the slavs . 
  the origin of the croatian slavs is said to be in white croatia , which is today 's poland/ukraine . 
  but this is a legend , it has little to do with history . 
  maybe this confused you :  the lands were ~ ~ then ~ ~ at that time controlled by the romans, 
  so there were 5 brothers and 2 sisters who came to croatia , leading the 7 croatian tribes , and they spread all around croatia . 
  they were named after the eldest brother , hrvat ( croat ) , who became the prince/duke of croatia . 
  hrvat had 3 sons ( leh , \u010ceh and meh ( rus ) ) and a daughter vilina . 
  when he died , he was inherited by his 4 children . 
  the lands were ~ ~ then ~ ~ at the time controlled by the romans so the 3 brothers were discussing plans on how to get rid of the roman rule . 
  the sister overheard them and revealed the plans to her lover , who was a roman general . 
  the brothers found out about their sister 's betrayal and they killed the general before he revealed their plans to anyone . 
  the romans started to gather their army to revenge for their general , but leh , \u010ceh and meh decided to escape . 
  ( their sister , vilina ( fairy ) , escaped to a cave and the fairies that lived there accepted her and she soon gave birth to a beautiful child . 
  one day when she was sunbathing in front of the cave , her brothers , who were hunting , saw her and , as a punishment for her betrayal , they decided to wall her up in a fortress ) [ source1 ] ( http://selo.hr/legenda-o-dolasku-hrvata/ ) [ source2 ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/krapina#legenda_o_.c4.8cehu.2c_lehu_i_mehu ), 
  in the croatian version of the legend , it has a prequel in which they are all the sons of hrvat ( croat ) :d, 
  this initiative is eu members only . 
  however , b&h is involved in other projects . 
  idk , as far as i know , this is strongly supported by the us . 
  i 'm not sure exactly about china , they seem interested , too . 
  this is primarily about stopping the dependency of eastern europe on russian energy and about building a better infrastructure . 
  but i guess we 'll have to wait and see what could actually be achieved . 
  look , / u/beskucnikov , we 're famous , too !, 
  it 's because the shaky relations in the last couple of weeks . 
  maybe they sent a lower-ranking official , i do n't know . 
  no , first vu\u010di\u0107 was supposed to come , then da\u010di\u0107 , but then they decided not to participate . 
  for croatia , concretely , because of things like [ this ] ( https://aboutcroatia.net/news/croatia/dubrovnik-forum-discusses-lng-terminal-between-poland-and-croatia-34619 ), 
  it 's mostly the ideological differences , hdz are the right-wing catholibans and sdp are not . 
  they are almost the same when it comes to the economic issues . 
  [ here ] ( http://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/hdz-i-sdp-zapravo-su-vise-slicni-nego-razliciti---447506.html?icn=article&amp;ici=related_middle-column ) , this short video explains that . 
  it 's an application where they answered questions with 1-10 , 1 meaning they completely disagree and 10 meaning they completely agree . 
  the minorities . 
  it 's not really what i think , it 's what i hope for . 
  we have mountains , too !, 
  if you can be '' adriatic '' , we can be '' mountain '' !, 
   and let 's face it nobody from the right trust zoki at all . 
  it 's not like any of them will think : `` ooh he is one of us now , let 's vote for him . 
  he did n't say it with the intention for it to go public . 
  he might be an idiot , but sdp winning the election in september is the best realistic outcome . 
  in the best case , they definitely wo n't win the majority in the parliament , but they 'll get support from the minority mps , who can condition the support with someone else as the pm . 
  i would say even worse things if that would mean that [ these people ] ( http://www.maxportal.hr/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/savska-na-trgu-stage-%c4%91uto.jpg ) would finally leave me alone, 
  what does croatia have to do with the rights of bosniaks in republika srpska ? 
  easy with that palinka !, 
   then why the hell do you want to live with that mess ? 
  i do n't live in bosnia , but you are underestimating the mess that the secession could cause  there are no croats come on now , some survived , 2,4 % is not that small  as for the bosniaks they will get their rights i 'm sure they will with dodik, 
  do n't worry , there will be no conflicts , i was just trying to say that he was pretty clear about his opinion on serbian leadership, 
  you are part of the mess , along with croats and bosniaks . 
  it 's not like croats and bosniaks will disappear from rs if you separate , you 'll have to accept them one day . 
  which means bosnia is rightfully ours !, 
  make croatia fat again !, 
  ( jk , we ai n't dealing with that mess ), 
  amateur , we 're all serbs . 
  god is a serb . 
  so what ? 
  so are croats and croats in herzegovina , but we do n't want them at all . 
   i would like to know how common people and government deals with these retards . 
  they always play the '' branitelji '' card , they think they 're above the law , so there 's nothing much anyone can do . 
  i know , i was being / s. 
  he did say some pretty harsh things about serbian leaders lol, 
  it 's much better for the relations if he wins than the ones who are currently in power . 
  what he said might be harsh but the recording is him speaking to a group of annoying , potentially dangerous group of far-right idiots . 
  they were already protesting in front of his house when only his wife and children were home , he probably thought it 's better to say to them what they like to hear so they 'll leave him alone . 
  he said that there is no '' order '' in b&h and that the eu should turn a blind eye to their eu accession requirements . 
  the lack of order = separatist movements inside the b&h . 
  he was being secretly recorded , no context at all . 
  okay , sorry , then . 
  anyway , i do n't see how rs and fb&h would be more functional if they split . 
  they would be countries made out of different parts not even connected to each other . 
  that 's not what he said nor would he ever agree to that . 
  this is not going to spark a new conflict . 
  what he said about serbia might , though . 
  it 's only a question of time ... 
  i know you were trying to banter i just do n't get the joke lol, 
   that 's jewish it 's the old testament in the christian bible . 
  but please , as if the new one is any better . 
   are you asking me how are pagan values better ? 
  no , i did n't ask that . 
  i asked a rhetorical question , implying that christians were as wild as some pagans . 
  are ancient romans , egyptians and mesopotamians considered pagans ? 
  how are christian values better than the pagan ones , anyway : * but if this charge is true , that the girl was not found a virgin , then they shall bring out the girl to the doorway of her father 's house , and the men of her city shall stone her to death because she has committed an act of folly in israel by playing the harlot in her father 's house ; thus you shall purge the evil from among you . 
  * - deuteronomy 22:21, 
  some did , some still do . 
  pagans were not a single culture . 
  i 've never heard about that , i 'm pretty sure it 's [ cockta ] ( http://croproducts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cockta-drink-lemonade-sok-1.5-liter.png ), 
  i do n't get it, 
  their national airline is also called adria airways , i guess they like being in the same region with us < 3 it also sounds nice , better than balkania airways, 
  have you brought your passport/id in case you fall in with your entire body ? 
  edit : calm down with the downvotes , janezi . 
  then you will say that we croats do n't have a sense of humor . 
  well , you 're no different !, 
  the horrifying [ facekini ] ( http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03017/facekini-6_3017499k.jpg ), 
  he is not wearing an adidas tracksuit but he clearly wanted to send a message with those adidas socks . 
   marriage is a very old tradition older than the catholic definition of marriage, 
   croatia : ** centre for peace studies ** , ** gong ** thanks soros , these are great organizations . 
  they would n't even have what they have if dubrovnik republic did n't sell that part to the ottomans , so little is better than nothing, 
  rimac said that he wants to make small amounts of cars like pagani . 
  hopefully he 'll change his opinion , because i think it 's a pity now that he 's got some attention . 
  the eu usually goes with [ this ] ( http://insideurope.eu/sites/default/files/croatia_0.png ) , continental and adriatic croatia, 
  then i expect from hungary to forget about balaton and choose the real sea in croatia . 
  it is on the market , if you want to spend 800.000 euros on a car, 
  this is an old article , now there is a concept_one s which accelerates 0-100 in 2.5 seconds .
