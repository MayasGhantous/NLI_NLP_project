  still , i do n't think 0,1 seconds is worth an extra 700.000 euros . 
  this is a car for the rich arabs who like to show off . 
  where would the sailing contest be if it were in hungary ? 
  we suck at blowing up iraq , though, 
  continental croats enter water for healing and relaxation purposes , not suffering . 
  interesting , but understandable , no one from continental croatia, 
  that 's what i would assume for any country in northern europe , i do n't know why . 
  there are also hockey , ice-skating , curling . . 
  people would assume they do much better in the winter olympics , but they have n't won a medal since 1998, 
  [ erdogan vs. other presidents ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jscj7nb.jpg ), 
   and you avoid disscusion like i do with any insane person . 
  you are insane . 
   but i know that you like to make hyperbolic statements with no sources . 
  what 's hyperbolic and without source in my statements above ? 
   i also know you like to derail the topic and relativize holocaust and nazism . 
  and i notice you mistake sychronicity with causality . 
  really ? 
  i learned something new about myself . 
  i do n't remember ever talking about holocaust before but i relativized it , too ? 
  i thought i was pretty left-wing . 
   me and you have nothing to talk about either way . 
  i agree . 
  you talked to me first , though . 
  it was not my intention to make you take me seriously , i am well aware of your narrow-minded standings from my previous conversations with you . 
  there are right-wing idiots everywhere . 
  croatia , slovenia and czech republic are probably the only post-communist countries where there is a relevant , strong social-democratic party . 
  meanwhile , you know what the 3rd biggest party in serbia is and what your president 's and prime minister 's political history is like . 
  the far-right party in croatia gets around 1 % in polls . 
  the serbian media is making it look as if we are walking with knives on the streets looking for serbs to kill . 
  when i was smaller , i liked cobra 11 and kommissar rex . 
  ( lying , still love them ), 
  can someone explain ex-yugoslavia ? 
  do you seriously , like seriously , believe that the majority of croats are denying the holocaust ? 
  i know what we are represented like by your media and by your politicians , which is absolutely terrifying , but do you actually think that the online comments of croats who register to comment on serbian sites are a credible representation of croatia ? 
  no need to go that far , just go to bosnia,

  it 's still better than what it would be translated to in croatian . 
  it also really bothers me that you say ** vse ** instead of ** sve **, 
  economic trends are finally looking good . 
  expected record tourist season also goes in our favor . 
  however , i do n't want to raise my hopes because i might jinx it . 
  we are still salty because we were , along with slovenia and czech republic , in the best position to catch up with the west after the fall of communism but our economy has practically stagnated for the last 20 years . 
  you are confusing adidas with adidos or adibas, 
  i just wish we had cersei to do the business , if you know what i mean . 
  also , two days ago the deputy minister of sport [ had to explain ] ( http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/440035/janica-kostelic-objasnila-crkvi-joga-jest-sport.html ) to the catholic church that yoga is not a satanic ritual , but a sport . 
  ( anyone watched got season 6 finale ? ), 
  * more than 95 % of population of bosnia and herzegovina belongs to one of its three constituent nations : bosniaks , serbs and croats . 
  the term constituent refers to the fact that these three ethnic groups are explicitly mentioned in the constitution , and that none of them can be considered a minority or immigrant . 
  bosniaks , serbs and croats are constituent nations of bosnia & herzegovina . 
  none of them are a minority . 
  croatia and slovenia will significantly strengthen the army with two and a half kamikaze planes that we own combined . 
  this guy needs jesus, 
   it 's gon na be like when celine competed for ~ ~ france ~ ~ switzerland, 
  there must be one at yanukovych 's ex-residence . 
  it 's fake . 
  they 're not competing . 
  ( unfortunately ), 
  they would only give points to catholic countries lol . 
  joking aside , they are allowed to participate . 
  i do n't understand why the hell are they not using the opportunity to participate in the greatest event in the universe . 
  i 'm jealous . 
  in what way ? 
  croats usually have a habit on hating and complaining about everything . 
  but support for the eu is generally high . 
  i think we should join again . 
  i loved the celebration last time we joined . 
  usually tourists visit croatia in the summer , but some destinations are just as good or even better in the winter . 
  [ never . 
  and apparently cause a traffic chaos for tourists travelling to and from croatia . 
  slovenia is closing both streets . 
  the [ actual brie ] ( http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/crop_0_961_2448_1884,scalefit_630_noupscale/57990e082a00002e004f6e62.jpeg?cache=evkqjtpbwo ) looks delicious, 
  you gave this island to italy back in the good old days !, 
  what happens when you burn a german 's towel ? 
  are we in war with germany now ? 
  some islands are almost exclusively sandy , but i do n't understand why foreigners like sand 24/7 with them during their holiday . 
  you ca n't ever wash it off your feet when leaving the beach . 
  ugh , only thinking about sand makes me angry . 
  most croats go to horrible places like these only when it 's necessary , like when they have little children . 
  i 'm going to hell for laughing,

  '' how to get pregnant at 98 and sacrifice your son 101 '', 
  that wild sheep should have been named after erdogan supporters , disappointing . 
  so either ljubljana is not in slovenia or ljubljana does n't recognize kosovo . 
  i would probably have to choose a lesser evil , so sdp ( s&d ), 
  all of those troll posts about croatia make sense now !, 
  i never understood why was this '' slovenian '' redditor so angry at croatia . 
  your flair is slovenian ? 
  i am not an expert on the sewage systems , so i ca n't tell . 
  but this about the public baths i know , and it was not only for the wealthy , they could probably afford to bathe at home . 
  i watched muhtesem yuzil , alright !, 
  both . 
  it 's still a thing today . 
  google turkish bath, 
  while i understand your point , i am pretty sure ottomans are known for their obsession with baths . 
  that is , of course , a private stance of the slovakian ambassador to serbia , so i do n't see how that is a valid argument . 
  the eu does not have a public stance on this , yet , as serbia still has n't opened that chapter . 
  it is expected for slovakia to have such stance as they do n't recognize kosovo themselves . 
  but most eu countries do and they will unlikely agree to another version of cyprus . 
   we will never recognize kosovo and metohia as a country . 
  i am pretty sure slovenia has recognized kosovo years ago .
