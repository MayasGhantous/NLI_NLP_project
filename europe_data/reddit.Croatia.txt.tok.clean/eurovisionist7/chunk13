  although , serbia is its own biggest blocker . 
  they wo n't join the eu before they recognize kosovo . 
  you think it would be okay if , for example , austria called for an anti-erdogan protest in istanbul ? 
  we have that , too . 
  the company is called dukat and they named the '' greek-type '' yogurt [ dukatos ] ( http://www.jatrgovac.com/usdocs/dukatos-natur-150g.jpg ) . 
  i do n't know if that 's also racist or not . 
  zagreb : prettiest - [ national theatre ] ( http://9227-presscdn-0-11.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/img_2145.jpg ) ugliest - [ this commie megabuilding ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wzwiz.jpg ), 
   is that a croat using ... cyrillic ? 
  it was an attempt , but my croatian brain refuses to read it like anything other than ksa-ksa-ksa  we win ** again ** !, 
  you serbs say that all the time as if you 've ever won anything against us before xaxaxa, 
  we have a saying '' pick up the cream '' and it means to come in the last moment when everything is already over to collect all the credit . 
  i think it 's pretty relevant . 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's from serbia, 
   who are the greatest people of ** your country ** ? 
   their golden age also known as the reign of suleiman the magnificent , who died during his battle against us . 
  it was 3.000 good croatian ( and hungarian ) men against 100.000 kebab . 
  btw , habsburg monarchy also participated in battle of vienna in 1683 . 
  she was born in the kingdom of poland , i know that she was n't ethnically polish, 
   theres ~ ~ two ~ ~ things that serbia must do to join the eu actually , there 's [ 35 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union#negotiation_progress ), 
  i guess that 's better than [ uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlc8ilvlzoq ), 
  we did that a [ century before ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_szigetv%c3%a1r ) . 
  no , it 's the opposite !, 
  ever heard of lech , czech and rus ? 
  well , you do n't know the complete story . 
  hrvat was their father . 
  ( at least in our legends , which are 100 % confirmed true ), 
  there is no single reason , but it 's a combination of appreciation of german mentality , german influence and stockholm syndrome . 
  it 's also partly because germany is the only one out of 5 biggest countries in europe that realizes we exist . 
   montenegro : hard workers [ lol ] ( https://youtu.be/fevzul1d-zk?t=200 ), 
   tengerfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r '' biograd na moru '' , capital of old croatian kingdom , before the queen consort of croatia , helena , gave the throne to her hungarian brother . 
   k\u00e1rolyv\u00e1ros karlovac , got name after it 's founder , austrian archduke karl  esz\u00e9k okay , osijek is yours . 
  but it 's not on the sea and it 's poor , so take it if you want . 
   ver\u0151ce virovitica , wirowititz in german . 
  it also sounds german so you ca n't have that . 
  oh , nothing sounds more magyar than '' fiume '', 
   that 's very not-catholic of him . 
  you disquallified yourself nope , you all fell in the trap and now believe in evolution . 
  earth is 6000 years old . 
   sorry that was us nope , you were on the other side . 
  that polish whore roxelana told her husband suleiman to spread kebab all over europe and we stopped him !, 
   but at time of commonwealth our motto was `` if god is with us , then who is against us ? '', 
  oh , too bad you abandoned it . 
  our national motto is '' god and croats ''  we were going to make ban on `` in vitro '' and abortion we banned gay marriage in constitution and our minister of education does n't believe in that bullshit called the evolution . 
   we have the biggest monument of jezus . 
  we have [ the smallest cathedral ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/church_of_the_holy_cross,_nin ) in the world . 
  because less is more in catholicism , amateurs !, 
   maria is our queen . 
  ( we sing `` maria our queen '' ) we do that to , except our marija [ glows in the dark ] ( http://www.medjugorje.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/glowing-statue.jpg ) because she loves us more than others . 
   we were asking `` where is saint cross ? '', 
  we sent a song called [ '' mary magdalene '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sehoc_qijnk ) to the eurovision . 
  our most popular singer has a song called [ '' hail mary '' ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyvktvwqifa )  and we christianized lithuania bitch , please . 
  we saved vienna from kebab . 
  so we are basically why europe is not kabab today . 
  that 's why our border is so weird !, 
   we also have catholic radio and catholic tv do you have to specifically call them '' catholic '' ? 
  because our national television and radio are catholic . 
  the pope was from the region in poland known as the motherland of croats , called white croatia . 
  italians could share , too !, 
  if yugoslavia was only slovenians and croats it would probably still exist today, 
  you give us a corridor to austria so we do n't have to pay for vignette and we give you a corridor to the international waters !, 
  they are trying to conquer 3 m2 of our sea so that they can have access to the international waters . 
  that 's not how you look for jobs . 
  you need to join a political party first . 
  of course not !, 
  it 's serbia 's biggest musical achievement , other than composing our anthem and winning the eurovision in 2007 . 
  but what about [ serbia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mjyz6yu8vk ) ? 
  but that one is true , no ? 
  italy and norway are hilarious !, 
  lithuania is especially confusing, 
  in germany ? 
  it all depends on what you are going to use it for . 
  spanish would be much easier for you to learn because it has more in common with your native tongue than russian . 
  slavic languages have 7 cases , which is 3 more than german . 
  but if you are planning to be in trade related business or something similar , russian is probably more useful in europe as it opens doors to a large market of russia and kazakhstan . 
  but it 's not ** the ** eiffel tower, 
  i do n't think anyone does that except serbia and macedonia, 
  yugoslavia was not in a cold war like ussr and its satellites . 
  therefore it was more open and people lived quite well . 
  that 's why there are so many people in ex-yu countries who are still nostalgic about that period . 
  the real question is why malta is always forgotten about . 
  it could be in a few years . 
  depends on who wins the election in september . 
  he was dismissed by the parliament , but he will still be in function until a new government is formed , which will happen after the election in september . 
  it 's a bay called after cape savudrija , also known as the westernmost point in istria and croatia . 
  more importantly , it is also known to be more western than cape madona in slovenia . 
  i know they are . 
  but it 's still surprising to me . 
  perhaps the catholic church is not as powerful in spain and portugal as it is in croatia and italy . 
  i find it so unusual that a catholic country in southern europe is so lgbt friendly . 
  have spaniards always been more open-minded than one would expect ? 
  [ beautiful times ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eabd-yxql0 )  piranski zaliv is that how slovenes call our savudrijska vala ? 
  never heard of that . 
  sounds illegitimate, 
  no , no , cro no give . 
  ask ita . 
  karl erjavec might be looking for a new job , 
  my german teacher wore black all the time and never smiled . 
  she yelled in german when we misbehaved so everyone was terrified and therefore learned german quite well . 
  sea slavs second best slavs . 
  here it 's mostly because of austrian and german influence .
