  it 's still common among old people in zagreb to insert some german words while speaking . 
  italian was also very popular in coastal regions . 
  interestingly , throughout history , we were also under a lot of hungarian influence , but we fought hard against hungarian . 
  i mean , who would n't ? 
  it 's impossible to learn . 
  in croatia , german used to be the most popular second language for a long time . 
  at least you can understand what he says . 
  our prime minister speaks gibberish . 
  damn you , slovenia !, 
  when we 're good at something you always have to be one step better than us . . 
  it 's never his fault , it 's always ours . 
  conspiracy or not , but you have to ask yourself why america is totally okay with saudi arabia , but not with some other countries in the middle east . 
  it is sarcastic . 
  i mean , i 'm pretty used to croatian drivers not following the rules , but italy is brutal , especially the south . 
  in italy ` stop ' means ` go ' in traffic, 
  just this morning i read [ an article ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/svijet/idi-kuci-strana-pi-hrvatica-brutalno-izvrijedana-u-velikoj-britaniji-nakon-brexita/4477913/ ) about a woman who got called names in a shop for speaking on the phone in croatian . 
  populism and nationalism is cancer . 
  i agree , but it could take years for them to be economically able to adapt to the euro . 
  also , ` post-soviet banana republics ' is not a good attitude if you want unity . 
  [ dark green ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/eu_members_where_more_people_in_favor_of_the_european_federation.png/800px-eu_members_where_more_people_in_favor_of_the_european_federation.png ) are countries that are more in favour of a federation than against it . 
  yes , some are , but some of those countries are overwhelmingly in favour of further integration , but are not members of the eurozone . 
  putting them in the ` second speed ' would likely make them lose interest . 
   we can create a second speed for the eastern expansion with less oblibations , and less rights/benefits that smells like a disaster, 
  the average gdp per capita in w.e. 
  would have to be between $ 170.000 and $ 220.000 for it to be 8-10 times richer than romania , which is not the case . 
  there are still countries who clearly do n't want the federation ( denmark , sweden , austria . . ), 
  i should move to fiji or tonga, 
  over here even the dead vote, 
  they are purposely making it dramatic until the last moment , just like in eurovision, 
  he got an ear lick instead, 
  and [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/f2u4ruv.jpg ) is our president and her husband during an official visit to germany, 
  [ more like this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3jhkbyzuq4 ), 
  they wo n't support anyone , at least that 's what they are saying now . 
  they always say that they are similar to the italian party m5s , the one that the newly elected mayor of rome comes from . 
  i would even compare them to ukip , as they are extremely anti-eu and very populist . 
  to conclude , like / u/suberee said , they 're weirdos who believe in all sorts of conspiracy theories . 
  the base of their financial program was written by a nurse . 
  yeah , timmy has been gone for some time now . 
  he did n't serve his buildings well . 
  he brought them on the edge of extension . 
  unless you are an insider and you know exactly what is happening between sin\u010di\u0107 / pernar/palfi and the people who are accusing them of falsifying documents , you do n't have enough information to call it an organized attack meant to destroy \u017divi zid . 
  i am not taking either side , this would not be the first time that the media is manipulating about \u017divi zid , but it would also not be the first time that the leadership of \u017divi zid is trying to manipulate the public . 
  they are populists , after all . 
  and i am convinced that the way they are leading the party is far from democratic . 
   btw , what 's that uppercased zid spelling , get rid of that shit dude ... come on now , i struggle to understand some of your grammatically incorrect sentences , even after reading them a couple of times . 
  meanwhile , you are bothered by this minor mistake , which would totally not be a mistake if ' \u017divi zid ' was a party in the uk . 
  for pametno , it all depends on how and how much will they be represented in the media . 
  most , for example , was constantly in the media for the last few weeks of the campaign . 
   i just said that two major parties in their primary media started an offensive with the goal of destroying \u017divi zid . 
  that 's what sin\u010di\u0107 and pernar said , but it does n't mean it 's true . 
  this is not the first time they have been accused of being autocratic . 
  an entire new party was formed because of this by the disappointed former members of \u017divi zid . 
  i do n't see why the media would n't report about the problems in 4th or 3rd strongest party , which \u017divi zid is , according to the polls . 
  pametno would n't get any mps if the election was held now , but the campaign has n't even started yet . 
  most 's popularity was doubled or even tripled ( in zagreb ) in the last month before the election . 
  how the parliament would look like if the election was now : [ pic ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bzsrdcs.jpg ) sdp-s & d : 38 % \u2191 hdz-epp : 31 % \u2193 \u017dz-ni : 9 % most-ni : 8 % \u2193 mb 365-ni : 3 % \u2193 ids-alde : 2 % orah-g/efa : 1 % \u2193, 
   sdp bulletin novi list and hdz 's public television brought public attention on `` internal '' fights in \u017divi zid to destroy them that 's what \u017divi zid said and that is always their excuse for whatever problem they have . 
  how do you know that sin\u010di\u0107 , palfi and pernar are not actually guilty ? 
  the party has already split once because of the autocratic leadership . 
  i think party pametno is also worth mentioning as they might be the new most . 
  it interests me , could you actually tell them apart if it was n't written which is which ? 
  i imagine it 's almost impossible for a foreigner to pronounce lj twice in a word , so i think lublana is close enough, 
  that 's how we call it , or \u0161pek, 
  it was no celebration, 
  a group of hajduk split fans protested against corrupt fa . 
  they announced it a few days earlier , so it was expected , even though we hoped it would n't happen . 
  please respect our privacy in these difficult moments . 
  adriatic assembly sounds more appealing, 
  game of thrones, 
  and a one german speaking queen , who was probably more important for croatia than all of those kings, 
  we do have similar interests but i do n't think our politicians are intelligent enough to team up . 
   and you have vatican . 
  not to shabby . 
  oh , you 're right , those [ fanatics ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vazkumr.gif ) ca n't believe i forgot about them . 
  shit . 
  serbia has russia , bosnia has turkey . . who do we have ? 
  i hope we do well but i can totally see us flop horribly . 
  we 've already become [ very cocky ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du23lz6dzas ) , which always brings bad luck ( mexico . . ) turkey , we still have ptsd from 2008 , so beware !, 
   removing marriage from legal system for everyone . 
  making it only religion thing . 
  marriage does not belong to a religion , same-sex marriages existed way before christianity or islam . 
  a secular , democratic country guarantees the same rights for all of its citizens and it should fight the influences which interfere with those rights . 
  i do n't care if the catholic church does n't allow same-sex marriage , but marriage outside of it is none of their business . 
   how many beers can you buy from a one salary ? 
  do you have segments like this in the news ? 
  here in croatia the news actually measure the quality of life by the consumption of coffee . 
  when the consumption is low , the times are difficult . 
  a common phrase is '' i do n't even have for a coffee ! '', 
  yes , you are generally wild when it comes to talking about war and serbs , but lazy when it comes to tilling the god-given , fertile as fuck , slavonian land . 
  how do i accept this ? 
  enough !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, 
  can you for once not act like balkanian wildlings ?? 
  [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngqnnvoybr0 ) basically, 
  yes, 
  no , it does n't mention god . 
  the presidential oath does , though . 
  here we go again, 
  we can only give you koper, 
  it really does depend on where you are from . 
  for example , i am from zagreb and i feel more similar to a slovenian in maribor than i do to a croat in split .
