   i read somewhere that croatia was offered a membership in v4 early on , but our dumbass government declined it . 
  oh , how [ fun ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ul77s8r.gif ) of our government, 
  yes , they arrived when czechia and croatia were in the same country , austria-hungary . 
  they settled mostly in the strongest agricultural county in croatia . 
  due to the very fertile soil , they bought the land there after the collapse of croatian nobility . 
  so you feel that poland is equally close to slovenia and to belgium ? 
  when i go to another slavic country and i see words that i recognize , i feel much more '' at home '' than in italy or france . 
  maybe i 'm being subjective , but i 'm pretty sure that 's how the majority feels . 
   do you automatically think `` oh those are our people '' yes , but , obviously , i feel the closest to the slavs around croatia and czechs are dear to our hearts for some reason, 
  i do n't agree . 
  slavs have always felt closer to each other than to other groups . 
  yes , but the protests started too late considering all the affairs this government has had since it took power . 
  especially with the pro-nazi minster of culture . 
  i wish we would learn from iceland . 
  good thing the government is counting its last days . 
  yes , we 're known for that . 
  i believe croatia was very much a part of the yugoslav nation . 
  anyway , does n't make much of a difference . 
  nothing and no one can ever stain tito 's legacy . 
  he is the greatest and the most widely respected politician croatia has ever had . 
  i feel no pity for the nazis he killed because i know what kind of horrible things they did to people just because their ethnicity was not correct . 
  fascist regime will never ever be equalized to the communist one , despite the high efforts of certain people . 
  this is my last post because i think further discussion is unnecessary , you can either accept his undeniable achievements or be butthurt about them . 
  that 's true . 
  all of the ex-yu nations should be grateful to him . 
  i did not miss anything . 
  tito is a national hero , despite the nazis he killed . 
  the japanese obviously care , as they asked for an apology from the us and obama . 
  no , i find using nuclear weapon even worse , especially considering that overwhelming majority of the fatalities were civilians , not soldiers like in bleiburg . 
  no one apologized for hiroshima and nagasaki, 
  okay , sorry , i should 've known it 's a very sensitive subject for you slovenes . 
  they 're still bigger than your coast !, 
  croatian exclave separated from the mainland by the ` bosnian riviera ', 
  henry truman threw two fucking atomic bombs on japan . 
  but americans still respect him because he stopped the war . 
  and from the recent news , obama has no plans to apologize for hiroshima and nagasaki . 
  tito is the best croatia had at the time . 
  no , i 'm just gon na agree with you that paveli\u0107 was a horrible leader for croatia and a quisling . 
  making the one who managed to retrieve the lost territories back to croatia - the most competent and the most worthy leader in the recent history of croatia . 
  tito , that is . 
  you mentioned a month-old state . 
  this was 14 years before ndh . 
  our neighbours will agree that it goes well with our personality, 
  https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rimski_ugovori_ ( 1941 . 
  i ca n't even, 
   nazi/fascist croatia was established in 1941 . and those territories had been lost in 1920 . 
  have you ever heard of the roman treaties : https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/rimski_ugovori_ ( 1941 . ), 
  croatia is missing . 
  yes , well , having seen the video now , i understand what you are talking about - i have no clue why someone would put an actual carpet on the wall . 
  it 's called tapestry . 
  it was quite popular in europe hundreds of years ago , especially in richer households . 
  today , i think it 's very rare . 
   btw , neighbours , why are these croats `` singing '' in slovene ? 
  i think \u0160e\u0161elj explained it quite well . 
  north-western croats speak slovenian and they belong to slovenia , the rest of croatia speaks serbian and they belong to serbia . 
  same here . 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ hate ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ us ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ 'cause ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ you ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ai n't ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ us, 
  why is everyone so critical about our customs ? 
  some cultures spank their women on easter while we prefer to do some ethnic cleansing . 
  no one is , everyone avoids it . 
  but i hate to always [ remind ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtga0jvhp2a ) about our common destiny ... 
  i do n't know what you are talking about . 
  please , anschluss us !, 
  i ca n't believe our plan is working , soon we will be living in germoney !, 
  please , you 're larger than ever on this map, 
  '' god that coat of arms is oversized and tacky ! '', 
  no and no, 
  no , you did n't . 
  you can not into adriatic . 
  to be fair , some croats from the island of hvar eat fried dormice . 
  but to be fairer , they were under italian influence throughout history , 
  because [ hdz ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivo_sanader#arrest_in_austria ) . 
  they 're ruling today again , btw . 
  because we 're smart people . 
  error 404, 
  they 're korean , idiot, 
  my grandma taught me that you eat cats ... 
  that 's a huge number of european countries wasting their time and money to ruin movies ... 
  what does the fox say ? 
  he 's croatian, 
  yeah but there is a better chance of changing that by not becoming a presidential dictatorship where the president will just appoint his puppets as prime ministers, 
  well if someone manages to enter second round , then maybe the people will be more motivated to go out and vote . 
  i do believe there will be a second round , all those polls that i have seen do n't seem realistic at all . 
  but who knows , maybe he really is that popular . 
   croatian academy of sciences and arts also rejects this declaration oh , another surprise !, 
  i am shocked !, 
   also overwhelming majority of ordinary croats . 
  source ? 
  or from your head ? 
  i do n't deny that the public is appalled by this , ** but that does n't change the fact that - standard - croatian is just a dialect of a broader language . 
  ** maybe we should change the standard croatian to what it should have always been ? 
  then i would agree with you . 
  of course they wo n't commit a political suicide by saying to balkanian tribes they actually speak the same language . 
   we altogether cherish our croatian language with all grammar and spelling . 
  not me . 
  \\ #freekajkavian, 
  this has literally nothing to do with yugoslavia, 
  ok , ok but they should come up with a different name . 
  * polycentric \u0160tokavian * sounds weird . 
  adriatic ocean best ocean !,
