  well i do hope serbia wo n't become another dictatorship , i do n't like this new trend in europe, 
  is this a meme or is it really that bad ? 
  ( because i read this a lot from canadians . ), 
  he 's on the level of that crazy president of the philippines, 
  the person you replied to usually comments only about 1990s war , so you should n't pay much attention to him . 
  aside from that , i also think there were people who were more deserving for this airport to be named after them ( herman bolle , slavoljub penkala ) , but zoki pushed this in desperate efforts to gain some votes from the right . 
   it is not like they perform in secret . 
  their concerts are broadcast on major tv stations . 
  then why did russia send this singer in the first place ? 
  they should know even better where their singer had been . 
  they just want to provoke . 
  guys , inform yourself on the situation before you start blaming ukraine . 
  ukraine ca n't ignore its own laws and turn a blind eye to a person who broke them . 
  russia is free to pick a person who did n't break ukraine 's laws . 
  why did they pick the person who did ? 
  aside from the fact that we are missing , that has to be the worst map i have ever seen . 
  tito was half-croatian , half-slovenian , actually . 
  but , yes , it would be more accurate to list him under croatia . 
  to me still looks like an asshole being an asshole . 
  13 is kolinda grabar kitarovic :'d, 
  if he did n't hear her , there were journalists to remind him , literally yelling '' handshake ! '', 
  maybe , but in the video it looks like he did hear her . 
  i can relate to this flag, 
  we are together with the uk and ireland , native proficiency, 
  well better that than garbage from albania , which usually appears around this time of the year xd, 
   now they will go into the offensive and collect signatures to force our government to buckle and change the constitution again . 
  the constitutional court already said that a referendum proposal to ban abortion would be ruled as unconstitutional , so no . 
  happy independence day and cheers to many more to come !, 
  error 404, 
  we do n't use diacritical marks for length , just for intensity . 
  therefore , ** \u0107 ** is a softer ** \u010d ** , not a long ** c ** :p, 
  we do n't know that , because we can only speculate what the other scenario would have been if the history played out differently . 
  magyarization was also one of the main reasons why croatia sided with the crown in 1848 . 
  so the argument '' at the time this was the right thing to do '' is completely justified . 
  how could have we sided with the hungarians when there was an anti-hungarian sentiment in croatia ? 
  that would have been just unrealistic . 
  it could n't be only our fault that we backstabbed hungary so many times , they were n't angels to us , either . 
  hungary looks like a balloon which was inflated inside of something . 
  well , until now i was n't even aware of this theory , so i can only say that he technically could have been of vlach origin , because they did move to that area where tesla was from . 
  however , they completely assimilated a long time ago , so those who were of that origin would n't have been aware of it . 
  disaster , it should be conchita wurst . 
  yes , the island of kor\u010dula sells a lot of merchandise based on that theory . 
   the father was called draghici which is romanian name . 
  same with the mother who was called gica mandici another romanian name . 
  it could have easily been a vlach name , if that 's what you meant . 
  a lot of them moved to those areas to protect the borders and completely assimilated . 
  but , i mean , we could go to infinity with that . 
  because their main ingredient is flour ? 
  maybe they eat a lot of bread , burek and lepinja, 
  i forget , how did she die ? 
  did n't she fall from a building or something ? 
  montenegrins have \u015a and \u0179, 
  romania slavic confirmed, 
  zagreb , it 's most likely a dedication to gotovac 's performance . 
  [ nsfw ] [ i think it might be this ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/slika/126/626405.jpg ) . 
  in croatian it would make sense because we call trees with leaves that do n't fall off ** crnogorica ** , * crno * meaning black . 
  so it might be similar in german . 
  you do have a seaport, 
  ... you are not afraid of women 's breasts . 
  i remember when it was cool to have it as a [ ring tone ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d89a_g6fcg ) on your sony ericsson , i still hear it sometimes with old people in public transport, 
  it 's also the fact that most residents work in the tertiary sector . 
  ** r ** acts as a vowel in this case , so there is no need for another one, 
  i am quite surprised that even our greens voted for ceta . 
  oh , no , they did n't . 
  they could go for days with arguing in circles . 
  just go to some thread fertile for them from a few days ago , you will see they are still arguing . 
   ~ ~ ( but maybe that means we are a rich city-state now ? 
  ah great , not only are we smaller than slovenia but also liechtenstein and andorra ... and pretty much everyone . 
  ( but maybe that means we are a rich city-state now ? ), 
  there is * novo mjesto * here in hr, 
  i mean , he did n't say anything wrong , it 's canada and the eu , since canada is not an eu member state ^ ^ ^ yet . 
  he said together with the eu, 
  maybe my impression is wrong , but that has triggered the other side of the spectrum to become more protective of the european values , which are being disrupted by the right-wing populism . 
  unlike in the us , in france the president becomes the one with the most votes . 
  hungary , i do hope your nuclear plant is a western type one, 
  or slov ** a ** nia . 
  cheating on jadranka ? 
  also not her . 
  [ this is her ] ( http://i.imgur.com/yiwg4e9.jpg ) , though . 
  coco t is not our president , i wish she was . 
  you 're welcome . 
  would you prefer to return to the pre-tie , [ collar world ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bvaiheh.jpg ) ? 
  [ that 's just a special treatment i have for you , joko11 . 
  yes , we must n't miss this opportunity for more promo to bring us into relevance . 
  where do you see '' \u010d '' ? 
  and then we are the serbs without a sense of humor ... 
  i want so see the rage when he meets someone called tvrtko, 
  wtf why did n't you liek bevor ? 
  he purposely said it like that , we do n't pronounce it as dubro-vnik . 
  i thought it was more like 70-80 %, 
  [ erdogan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bkkv01ygvw ), 
  that woman on 1:14 is my soul mate xd, 
  nope , i did watch the '' interview '' with kolinda , which was quite funny . 
  i hardly register that as comedy , but , ok , they are getting better . 
  though their new year 's special from a year ago was quite funny , so they could do it if they try hard enough . 
  just that small part in china ? 
  at least the franz josef land should be annexed , too , even though that arctic archipelago would also suck compared to those fancy french/british/dutch islands in the caribbean ... 
  we do n't have a late night comedy show , do n't know who 's going to make it for us :(, 
  '' russian ! '', 
  from that same family , the most famous legends are probably about barbara cilli ( celjska ) , she is known as the * black queen * here in zagreb .
