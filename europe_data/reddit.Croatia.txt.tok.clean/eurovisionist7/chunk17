  we do , too . 
  not completely fictional , my dog has a passport like that !, 
  it was the election year and the social-democrats were in power , and they are often affiliated with the communists so they did n't want to give the right-wing a topic to go crazy about . 
  not because of that , it was decided that it will stay this way . 
  there is no obligation to change it to red . 
  no , do n't worry . 
  neum would be more useful if we wanted something like that , anyway . 
   croatia does n't ~ ~ want ~ ~ claim the entire coastline ftfy, 
  dafuq did i just read ? 
  your girlfriend is not a very good source xd, 
  it 's much closer if you merge l and j into one letter , like we do . 
  so '' lj '' is the same sound as the italian '' gl '' in [ '' cagliari '' ] ( https://forvo.com/word/cagliari/#it ), 
  do n't worry , considering their economic situation , they wo n't be wanting independence for the next million years . 
  yes, 
  i like turtles, 
  asians and german language are a hilarious combination to me for some reason, 
  i do n't think anything bad can happen to you on those guided tours , i assume the danger is in flying from beijing to pyongyang in a 50-year-old air koryo plane . 
  that person is insane . 
  i 'm not sure what happened today , but he always disrupts the parliament . 
  example : [ here he is ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs7f0c7mdam ) showing photos to the speaker of the parliament which he took of him and other mps moments earlier . 
  [ here are the photos ] ( http://www.index.hr/black/clanak/imamo-fotke-pogledajte-sto-je-to-pernar-snimio-u-saboru/937151.aspx ) he took . 
  the real one , not the american copy . 
  poor europeans want to google their great leader and it auto-corrects it to this fraud , it 's probably rigged . 
  but donald t. is our main president, 
   he also became president only by the fact that people were so fed up with boris tadic they could 've chosen anyone . 
  what a mistake . 
  i miss the times [ when our presidents watched football games together ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/josipovictadicutakmica_cropix2.jpg ) . 
  my reaction when the media i control says i only get 10 % in polls and the election is in 3 months . 
  i 'm sure the netherlands would have loved to do it voluntarily , only if they were given the access to the area . . 
  it 's not very logical to me . 
  october is * listopad * ( * leaf-fall * ) in croatian but in czech * listopad * is november . 
  meanwhile , * studeni * ( * cold * ; czech and belarusian january ) is our november . 
  maybe croatia used to be very cold in the past !, 
  yes, 
  at least they hit the shelves soon enough so we could learn eventually !, 
  that 's still better than [ the rest of the communist block after the curtain fell ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jy3qfj6khq0 ) . 
  in croatia the stereotypical [ czech tourist ] ( http://i.imgur.com/6zgjlfa.jpg ) is wearing sandals and white socks , but i guess it also applies to poland and slovakia . 
  you know who we are , we kicked your ass in football and basketball in 2016, 
  and czechnya is poorer socks + sandals, 
  we 'll force them to love us . 
  it does . 
  it 's still not too late for you to join us on the correct side , which i predict you soon will . 
  not anymore , we successfully brought them on the dark side , they are soon to be our allies and partners in nato . 
  [ * laughs wickedly * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inkrf43szeu ), 
  i was thinking of slovenia and montenegro , bosnia is almost the same as croatia by size and population . . 
  why ca n't we have our slovakia ? 
  in fact , we have two slovakias . 
  it 's not the same as constantinople and istanbul because both ragusa and dubrovnik were in use since the residents spoke multiple languages . 
  ragusa is still ragusa , it 's not controversial to call it that , if that 's what you thought . 
  what is the difference ? 
  meh , joining alone was better , anyway . 
  we enjoyed the spotlight , the celebration with [ schulz ] ( https://youtu.be/prvd_sg-wnm?t=4710 ) was epic . 
  well , judging by [ this ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/09/e7/7e/39/zadar-city-gate.jpg ) , they were built during the venetian republic . 
  they might be older , i 'm not sure . 
  split 's city walls are ancient , though . 
  but none of them are as popular as dubrovnik , so i do n't think that 's what they meant . 
  '' ancient '' walls of dubrovnik are from the 14th century lol, 
  you are literally asking to be annexed right now, 
  why is tuva so wild ? 
  i thought the peaceful nomads were living there . 
  highest suicide rate in europe also confirms it, 
  alcohol , wine in particular, 
  [ or this ] ( https://youtu.be/vj920cn2hma?t=24 ), 
  who ? 
  when you lie in bed all day everyday it gets boring, 
  [ croatian saint lucia ] ( http://www.camp-terre.hr/images/vino-terre-sveta-lucia2.jpg ), 
  no one really speaks standard croatian in real life , it 's just for schools and tv . 
  if you come to zagreb from slavonia , where they speak the closest dialect to standard croatian , you will be teased about your accent, 
  here we think the '' uneducated '' are the ones who are not speaking your dialect lol, 
  no , unfortunately , only standard croatian is taught in state schools ( with the exception of some schools in the north which offer it as an optional subject ) . 
  it 's sad that it 's not encouraged more together with chakavian . 
  kolindiranje is when you take a photo to look like you 're doing something . 
  this is a great example of [ kolindiranje ] ( http://www.p-portal.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/kitarovic_crkva-800x445.jpg ), 
  we already have our own selfie queen, 
  no , you did n't see [ the cropped out part of that photo ] ( https://img.rtvslo.si/_up/upload/2016/12/09/65365610_clipboard01.jpg ), 
  yeah , sure , '' diplomatic protest note '' * bombs back *, 
   they have some problems with slovenia uh-oh , stay alert , slovenia !, 
  you 're not safe , either . 
  where 's the bit where foreign minister dacic says that it 's logical that croatia is not arming itself to bomb vienna and budapest , but belgrade :'d ( it 's the best part of this imo ), 
   honestly , would you consider some kajkavac in zagreb or \u010cakavac in zadar not to be speaking croatian ? 
  they are definitely not speaking standard croatian , therefore kajkavian and chakavian are not a part of the official curriculum . 
  i 'm not sure if you 've ever had a chance to encounter pure kajkavian ( not the zagreb kind ) , but the mutual intelligibility with standard croatian is very low and a lot of linguists consider kajkavian to be a separate language . 
  croatian is not serbian in latin script , fyi , 
  it was an overused 1914 joke, 
  what about [ this flag ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/flag_of_split.svg/220px-flag_of_split.svg.png ) of split ? 
  i think austria is behind this, 
  no , come back !, 
  what a drama queen , it was just a prank . 
  yes , yes . 
  you can also see she 's very a very moderate eater in accordance with the catholic faith . 
  ours had a turnout of just 37 % but we do n't have a quorum so it passed : /, 
  hehe i 've heard [ our main anti-marriage equality movement leader ] ( https://i.ytimg.com/vi/edj6cbs5cow/maxresdefault.jpg ) also campaigned in slovakia after banning it in croatia , you 're welcome . 
  [ bella ciao ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ci3lhynkfo ), 
  i have no idea , i ca n't cook :d i assume they come salty as they are not fresh , we usually make it as a [ soup with potatoes ] ( http://narodni.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bakalar-za-badnjak.jpg ) . 
   also , many people separate the wwii anti-fascist struggle from the communist totalitarian state that came after it but used the same symbols . 
  sorry , i am not hearing lectures on anti-fascism and totalitarianism from a person whose username is [ crna legija ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/crna_legija ) . 
  but i must say that this is so typical and expected from people like you , they are always like that . 
  at least learn to have the guts to say what you really stand for , do n't always hide like a beach . 
  in croatia it 's the [ dry cod fish ] ( http://image.dnevnik.hr/media/images/1024xx/dec2014/61024737-bakalar-riba.jpg ) for some odd reason ( we do n't have it in the adriatic ) . 
  but now , seeing this tradition , i 'm guessing it 's because the retailers did n't want to deal with all that mess .
