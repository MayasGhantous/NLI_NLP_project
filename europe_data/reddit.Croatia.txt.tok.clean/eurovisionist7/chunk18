  ( dead carp is still very popular , though ), 
  classic answer , both have nothing to do with the croatian liberation . 
  we 'll still keep celebrating the [ anti-fascist struggle day ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-fascist_struggle_day ) as a national holiday and it 's clear [ who the liberators were ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_partisans ) . 
  it would be absurd to ban their symbols . 
  the point is in equalizing of ideologies that were never and will never be equal . 
  red star is a symbol under which territories with hundreds of thousands of croats were liberated from the occupation . 
  the swastika is a symbol under which those territories were given away . 
   driving his vw van with a nazi flag hanging out the window and pictures of ** mussolini ** most definitely not a croatian hahah, 
  as the tag says , this is n't about acceptance ( even though i do n't remember that people complained about the lgbt parade here in zagreb ) . 
  one of the things that gave us a boost is probably the advanced transgender law . 
  fiume is n't a part of either / r/istria or / r/dalmatia, 
  kra\u0161 's description :  bajadera is the queen of chocolates , fine nougat blended with almonds which gives a unique , recognizable flavour . 
  basically , a high quality ( and expensive ) nougat pralines . 
  they are very delicious , no question . 
  they look like [ this ] ( http://www.sibenik.in/upload/novosti/2014/01/2014-01-04/17731//bajadere_1.jpg ) . 
  i think we 've overtaken you in the latest report, 
  sure , but from serbian chocolates [ this one ] ( http://www.swisslion.hr/template/thumbs/012a70170836251df7206dfacd78c343_365_214_m3.jpg ) is my favourite . 
  she said that islam is becoming more radical in bosnia and then some famous bosnian comedian made a bunch of sexist jokes about her . 
  poor kolinda , she 's been getting a lot of unnecessary criticism this week , first from bosnia and now from serbia :'|, 
  i understand why it 's '' controversial '' , but the point is that it 's just a chocolate . 
  and another article says that it 's a factory with 20 % of croats and 60 % of hungarians employed in subotica . 
  good for you , not my favourite , unless you consider * bajadera * a chocolate . 
  but your question '' are we really fighting on a piece of chocolate now ? '', 
  was ignorant of possible future chocolate crisis , you take it for granted . 
  chocolate is the only reason i would agree to go to war for , tbh . 
  it 's a specific grimase that nigel and camilla make , regardless of whether they 're smiling or laughing . 
  something 's different , there must be , maybe the mandibula ... maybe it 's the aristocratic laugh , it looks genuine but evil . . 
  most likely i just dislike nigel . 
  [ what is with the british people smiling like that ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/31/98/ef/3198ef3f350cfae32b8e2f785abf2af4.jpg ), 
  i 'm going to include news sites , they get more peppery than the newspapers . 
  [ narod.hr ] ( http://narod.hr/ ) & [bitno.net ] ( https://www.bitno.net/ ) - ultra catholic , do n't get scared 2 . 
  [ dnevno.hr ] ( http://www.dnevno.hr/#axzz4s0kplj00 ) - also right-wing , conspiracy theories 3 . 
  [ direktno.hr ] ( http://direktno.hr/ ) - i do n't know to this day if it 's satire or not , one of the main contributors is [ velimir bujanec ] ( http://data.glasistre.hr/sites/default/files/imagecache/vijest/bujanec_velimir1-250211.jpg ) 4 . 
  [ ve\u010dernji list ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/ ) - comment section is croats and serbs exchanging juicy slurs 5 . 
  [ 24sata ] ( http://www.24sata.hr/ ) - tabloid, 
  you picked the shittiest , though . 
  we know , fellow antemurale christianitatis, 
  as you can see , it 's not only bulgaria that ca n't do it, 
  is this because we 're so close and friendly or because one side did n't agree to give the other side of the bar to another ? 
  but estonia is colored . 
  i guess they only counted full lions , we only have lion heads . 
  we 've got 3, 
  you are speaking as if we were in contact with russia, 
  some of our neighbors flooded , too . 
  ugh , such a loss . 
  but , seriously , hungary can finally into sea now !, 
  she did look very happy one time on 16.7.2014 . in brazil . 
  we have a saying : `` everyone scratches where it 's itchy '', 
  what about bosnia , serbia , macedonia and montenegro ? 
  at least they have obvious examples . 
  also , i 'm sceptical about the croatian '' \u017divi zid '' party . 
  i do n't think so because he would n't put croatia in the group of the most slavic nations then , as slovakia , czechia and russia have more '' yellow '' than us . 
  lol , looks like they 're more slavic than you and serbia, 
  how tf is belarus the most similar to us ? 
   poles , croatians , belarusians and ukrainians are the most slavic nations . 
  '' south slavic '' is not really slavic , i have no idea where the belarusians got so much blue from . 
  it 's actually a haplogroup originating from the ancient people who lived here before the slavs came . 
  boring , we did n't have a suspension railway, 
  thank you for clarifying , i knew that . 
  yes , sandra threw further than the men 's category winner . 
  you do n't want to mess with her , do you ? 
  seriously , you 'll have to speak up . 
  those 5 gold medals of ours are the loudest . 
  what about football ? 
  where were you in ~ ~ 1991 ~ ~ euro 2016 ? 
  ca n't hear you over the sound of our 10 medals from the 2016 olympics !, 
  ugh , i 'm so disgusted by your jealousy about our polyglotism !, 
  djibeauty wins, 
  if that is n't a peninsula than neither is balkan . 
  i guess , but i do n't see a point in it . 
  why not draw a line from hamburg to genoa and call everything west from it a peninsula . 
  we have the second one , too . 
  the first one is closer to the meaning , though . 
  no , adriatic is going to be the new nordic in 40 years . 
  that 's how advanced we will be . 
  well not only croatia according to your article , but also hungary , slovenia and greece . 
   i do n't know about you , but bosniaks are n't culturally almost the same as us . 
  not that it matters , we got used to it . 
  i do n't think that was the point . 
  for example , croats from the north and croats from dalmatia are culturally miles apart , if you look at their music , national costumes , cuisine ... 
  but their basic values are identical . 
  oh wow , looks awesome . 
  does it also have a moon door ? 
  i need some of that green, 
  that 's not where kl is, 
  i love portugal but there is space in the baltics , too . 
  well , not if serbia is closer to the bottom value and slovenia to the upper value of the $ 1000 - $ 2000 range ... 
  did you know you had ancestors from iberia , britain ... ? 
  or was it a surprise ? 
  it was a revenge for the north brabant flag, 
  it probably came alive because hungary was ruled by an admiral while having no sea access , but that 's just guessing , i could n't find any info about its origin . 
   i believe it is the same case with poland , slovakia or hungary . 
  or even slovenia/croatia . 
  yes , but for us it 's mostly * western balkans * that causes an eye-twitch . 
  why not just switch places with macedonia ? 
  there is nothing in that phrase that would suggest croatia and hungary are not friendly countries , it 's more like * not my problem . 
  it 's a phrase . 
  * you/i do n't give a fuck about hungary not having a sea . 
  * , basically not giving fuck about something . 
  slovenia would claim the bay of slavonia due to copyright issues,
