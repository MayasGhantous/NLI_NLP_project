  impossible, 
  yes , or hladetina, 
  not really . 
  some of them are about the length of your coast . 
  well still not that humorless i hope ? 
  now we croats are known not to be very good with humor but it was a joke, 
  fortunately bosnia is close enough, 
  i was never brave enough to try it . 
  but my family members like it . 
  it 's a popular dish here , i do n't think it 's ours . 
  at least i hope it 's not . 
  edit : it 's either czech , austrian or bavarian , the origin can not be defined with certainty ( probably because they all deny it 's theirs ) . 
  brace yourself for [ this ] ( http://mojzagreb.info/images/uploads/recepti/186/predjelodrhtalica.jpg ) jello pizza, 
  small voivodeship having the same nominal gdp as the second largest country in africa does n't sound bad at all !, 
  so ridiculous how one letter can change the whole meaning, 
  we call them \u0161pice ( schpitze ), 
  it 's not gdp per capita, 
  there is only one thing you need to know , they have the best cola in the world and it 's called [ cockta ] ( http://www.jatrgovac.com/usdocs/cockta-025_classic1.jpg ), 
  it 's because we did n't understand a word you were saying, 
  same here , we call them ` nijemci ', 
  that 's how we call it . 
  it means both ` czech republic ' and ` it scratches ', 
  split and dubrovnik are nice for sightseeing , but beaches are not the best croatia can offer . 
  i personally like islands ; hvar , bra\u010d , kor\u010dula ... 
  they have a countless number of beaches that are not crowded and they all have a few small , but touristy/alive towns . 
  if you want to be close to a larger town , i suggest you go on google maps and find a small village close to that town , i.e. 
  srebreno near dubrovnik . 
  [ ` only 13 % ' ] ( https://media.giphy.com/media/laju5ie8su9aa/giphy.gif ), 
  slavic countries are the best in europe/world when it comes to equal wage , but that 's because they were all communist in the past . 
  that 's actually one of the rare good things left from communism . 
  but , as i mentioned earlier , russia , i.e. , is one of the worst countries when it comes to domestic violence on women . 
  well , that was a bit exaggerated on my side , but i think it 's stupid to call a society matriarchal because the woman is the one who decides what is for lunch or what detergent is going to be bought . 
  there are so many more important things than that and that does n't make a society matriarchal . 
  there is no matriarchal society in europe and there is no country in europe where women are in a better or equal position as men , unfortunately . 
  i know , but people who voted for pis knew what kind of party it is and that it is even further right than po, 
  no , i do n't even want to hear about the evil propaganda coming from jealous western tribes . 
  from my sources ( in croatian ) , ` slava ' and ` slovo ' have the same root . 
  it is also explained that their meaning is closely connected , because the one who is glorious ( slava ) is the one who is talked about ( slovo ), 
  there is always a ` srboljub ' , meaning serb-lover . 
  there are also so many slavic names ; slaven ( literally meaning slav ) or jugoslav first come to my mind . 
  ` slava ' ( glory ) is actually a word that slavs got their name from , because they were glorious . 
  brija\u0107i and brija\u010di . 
  one is an adjective meaning ` shaving ' ( e.g. 
  shaving razor ) . 
  brija\u010di is plural of brija\u010d , meaning ` shaver ' . 
  the accent is also different , though, 
  yes that 's our digraph nj, 
  please [ compare ] ( http://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/rainbow-europe/2015 ) the situation in croatia with the rest of eastern europe . 
  also , split is not a representation of croatia . 
  comparing split to zagreb , rijeka or istria is like comparing alabama to california . 
  \u017d is same here , we took that from czech , actually . 
  as well as \u010d and \u0161 . 
  before that , our letters used to be much more complicated . 
  i think \u0148 is the same as our nj ( counts as one letter ) . 
  i never said anything is ideal . 
  but comparing to other eastern european countries , slovenia , croatia and czech republic are the gay-friendliest countries . 
  it may sound stupid but 5 years is a lot of time for people to become more accepting of gay rights , especially because of the progressive government we had since 2011 . 
  even if you look at the most popular political parties , only in slovenia and croatia are progressive , left-wing parties relevant . 
  if only i could read that lol . 
  but i trust you, 
  it does n't even matter in spoken language , you usually ca n't even hear the difference in croatian . 
  but it 's important in written language because you 'll seem illiterate if you mix them . 
  croats are actually made fun of by serbs and bosnians because we pronounce everything softly or in between \u010d and \u0107 , never a straight , strong \u010c . slovenes , on the other hand , made their lives easier and they do n't even have \u0107 in their language , only \u010d, 
  \u0107 is pronounced the same as \u010d , but softer . 
  so both is ch , but with a different intensity, 
  i know the croatian one is pu\u010di\u0161\u0107a on the island of bra\u010d . 
  try pronouncing that . 
  romania is n't that poor , like moldova , for example , to expect a bigger growth . 
  this is a very high growth , even for the poorest countries, 
  it 's different for any family . 
  it 's usually a compromise , but in a husband-wife relationship it 's the same as ravenren wrote . 
  but you ca n't call a society matriarchal based on that . 
  there are more important things than family that women are not in charge of . 
  also , russia is in top 10 countries in the world by domestic violence on women . 
  come on now . 
  croatia and slovenia are probably the best slavic countries in that field . 
  also in gay rights . 
  i would add czech republic , too . 
  you ca n't call a society ` women friendly ' if a prime minister wants to ban abortion or if women protesters are sent to gulags because they ` offended the orthodox church ', 
  well , the series is probably every historian 's nightmare . 
  but it 's just so infectious !, 
  they maybe did n't have a polish person so they thought russian is close enough . 
  btw , what language is she speaking [ here ] ( https://youtu.be/4mwwfv9vlb0?t=2107 ) ? 
  [ she ] ( https://youtu.be/4mwwfv9vlb0?t=2257 ) came to visit roxelana , because she had a good relationship with sigismund . 
  the main reason she came was to ask for help because it was not a good year for farmers and people were starving . 
  roxelana is chortling because they used to be her leaders while she was a poor village girl , but now she is so powerful that they ask her for help .

  in english it 's sultana . 
  in croatian it 's sultanija . 
  i know it 's the same in turkish but it 's easier for me to separate it . 
  damn you !, 
  you ruined my life !, 
  more left, 
  i 'm so jelly right now . 
  i should make my mother call me sultana . 
  i should also find an eunuch to announce my arrival so that people can bow down before i come in , but that might be more difficult to arrange . 
  okay , we 'll play with you . 
  but at your place this time !, 
  it has become so bad for me that my goal in life is to marry a sultan and become a valide sultana . 
  most of them do .
