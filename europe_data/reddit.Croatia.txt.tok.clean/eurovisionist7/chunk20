  how long can we play the `` hidden '' card for ? 
  the temperatures are higher , but somehow i 'm putting up with it better than the previous heat wave . 
  well i understood that far , but i do n't understand the reason . 
  against the entire g20 or just some countries ? 
  what are they doing ? 
  vulin is the minister of defence ? 
  i though he was interior minister . 
  ( or minister of arguing with croatia ), 
  i do n't understand why . 
  are they against russia losing market in ee ? 
  because this is not about trump and being against the eu at all , it was supported by the previous administration and it would have been supported by clinton . 
  france collected almost all colours , one missing . 
  watt ? 
  it 's not ** that ** difficult to be a billionaire with a hungarian currency , i assume ? 
  i wondered what happened to / u/trogz1, 
  well not obvious for everyone , especially tourists . 
  we learn from the early age about them , but there was a macedonian [ a couple of years ago ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hldejr3m5jw ) who got into a lot of trouble for petting it , he probably did n't know what it was . 
  do n't think of '' disturbing '' them if you happen to see them on a beach in croatia , it will cost you up to $ 4000 in fines . 
  so keep a smart distance . 
  i like the rule , better build a couple of smaller ones on the same surface than one big lonely skyscraper . 
  those few that we have now still look lonely to me , zagreb is quite large for the population it has , i guess . 
  nevermind , the cathedral always has one tower under renovation because it 's made of limestone , so there are n't that many good photos of it anyway . 
  zagreb cathedral at 108m is the tallest in croatia , then euro tower i and strojarska business center , both at 96m . 
  i assure you , this time next year the majority will identify as '' pacific croats '' . 
  the minority laws will be the same as in crimea , so basically they get abducted at night and get sent to heaven . 
  what better treatment could one ask for ? 
  of course , our military is just strong enough for 10.000 nauruans , the support will fly as far as 98 + % . 
  i wonder if the small republic of nauru would suffer if we annexed them . 
  fuck the international law , let 's just do it and see what happens . 
  those are average middle class houses, 
  google says it means old town . 
  in latin , civitas vetula . 
  romans renamed it to vecla and finally venetians to veglia . 
  i guess they got rid of * m * too to make it symetrical . 
  but it is quite interesting , same as trieste --  trst , it really looks like ditching the vowels on purpose . 
  the roman name is curicum , so they shortened that for that , got rid of the vowels . 
  you obviously misunderstood me , i 'm not on the locals ' side in this case . 
  i do have some sympathy , they could have been born on the island of krk where only families and german pensioners go , but such is life . 
  if they want to work in a field instead of having a more than a comfortable life for the rest of the year by renting apartments to drunk tourists in the summer , they are free to send them away as far as i 'm concerned . 
  why would a party island change the way it 's advertising itself ? 
  we need that kind of tourism , among others . 
  this island has been a destination for the trash since i know of myself , it just appears that the brits are stepping up the trash game . 
  there 's plenty of other destinations in croatia with the different kind of british tourists , ~ 1200 other islands , for example . 
  i think it was obvious that * for * would win , so people stayed at home . 
  it was also at the time when the eu was n't in the best shape , so a lot of them were n't too enthusiastic to vote . 
  the eu accession is generally perceived as '' returning home '' , where we belong . 
  unfortunately they do n't offer submarine transport, 
  i do n't know why everyone thinks it 's a tabu to call it that , fiume is literally an italian version of rijeka , and they both mean the same thing - river . 
  not to mention that italian is still important in that part of croatia . 
   under a-o , the whole of istria was under the austrian crown land of austrian littoral . 
  croatia was n't even in the austrian part of a-o dalmatia was also in the austrian part , you can claim the entire coast as well :d, 
  he 's our itscalledunicode ... 
  fiume is not the subject of arbitration, 
  there , there, 
  what about italians ? 
  none of our ex-yu neighbours , which we have 4 of ( unlike 1 in your case ) . 
  how surprising . 
  i still do n't get the picture after 53 minutes : /, 
  over here there is a conspiracy that the us acquired it for us because of slovenia getting closer to russia or something like that ... 
  it was a live show and this is probably a screenshot . 
  he said they will now be working on buying the ina shares from hungary . 
  probably a joke also, 
  no , it 's either people with one ring or with 50 rings , there is nothing in the middle . 
  why rings on both hands ? 
  please , just stop with this * who is jealous of who * rural mentality . 
  both slovenia and austria are our inspirations , most recently in terms of recycling - slovenia is always mentioned as an example . 
  but trying to influence the arbitration judges is clearly not a european way and that 's the point of all this . 
  awww, 
  [ or ... ] ( http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8lr2k_severina-gdje-je-nestala-slovenija_shortfilms ) seriously , though , do n't go :(, 
  we lost an arbitration with hungary in the case of ina-mol in december , that 's one of our most , if not the most , important companies - nothing happened . 
  the government accepted defeat . 
  so your prejudices are wrong . 
  there was a parody of our pm at the time and pahor deciding on the border [ by a game of * risk * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eabd-yxql0 ), 
  no , it could n't . 
  cerar really is so awkward , i like pahor more . 
  to exit the arbitration you need a 2/3 majority in the parliament , so it 's not that easy if you do n't have a good reason for it . 
  but the pinky promise would have been fulfilled if the scandal did n't break out . 
  the part ~ ~ or ~ ~ of the deal was a fair arbitration , which unfortunately it was n't . 
  edit : of, 
  it would be finally over tomorrow if the arbitration was n't compromised . 
  now it will be dragged for years again . 
   it 's not like cdu/csu had a sudden change of heart well , there 's still time , take some other we conservatives as an example . 
  it would be nice , i said , not that i 'm expecting it . 
  i do n't see that happening before both countries introduce an over 50 or 60 per cent voter turnout requirement for a referendum to be valid . 
  but it would be nice if cdu influenced its sister parties in croatia and slovenia on this issue , it would speed up the process . 
   in croatia there is a joke i do n't know why i expected anything good after that, 
  lol, 
  i believe croatia is the strongest advocate of b&h in the eu parliament , criticism does n't equal hostility . 
  in istria and primorje it 's mostly chakavian . 
  yes , because it was the anti-fascist struggle day and they were celebrating the partisans who happened to free istria and dalmatia under those symbols . 
  they are n't communists or extremists , it was the * anti-fascist struggle day * today and they were celebrating [ the partisans ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sisak_people%27s_liberation_partisan_detachment ) . 
  so sa\u0161a , she has his eyes . 
  but who will be president ? 
  yes , but not for the documents, 
  there is already a few posted on r/vexillology : [ germany ] ( http://i.imgur.com/agrhlbt.png ) , [ lithuania ] ( http://i.imgur.com/beppwqn.png ) , [ spain ] ( http://i.imgur.com/v3dep82.png ), 
  meet [ specxmen specimen ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/novaosobnamup1.jpeg ) , he looks much older than he really is . 
  now someone make the croatian coa style ones, 
  i know , i was being sarcastic because i completely disagree . 
  the point is , there are 3 nations in b&h but every side ca n't see further than what 's in their interest . 
  so what i 've heard until now : '' serbian parts are split in two but there is a possibility for that to be modified since some parts of br\u010dko also have a serb majority . '',
