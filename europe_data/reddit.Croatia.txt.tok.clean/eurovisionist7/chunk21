  okay , that is cherry picking but it works . 
  for you . 
  but what about the rest ? 
  '' * fuck them , none of our business * '' or what ? 
  it 's also naive to expect dodik , izetbegovi\u0107 and \u010covi\u0107 to carefully and rationally approach to the subject when they can barely sit together . 
   i 'm sure there 's something that could be worked out if everybody could just talk reasonably and honestly . 
  thank you , i completely agree . 
  the only reasonable thing the bosnians can do is to accept the fact that the nineties are over and that no one is separating or annexing anyone . 
  right , and the croats and bosniaks would be completely fine with that . 
  in what alternative universe is it possible that croatia would annex the parts above br\u010dko and the croats in fbih remaining indifferent to that ? 
  they totally would n't care and would n't want the same , right ? 
  the period of the division of territory is over , sooner or later bosnians will have to get used to that .

  i must have an impaired vision , i guess . 
  i see multiple croatian exclaves , 3 bosniak and serbian parts split in two . 
  [ according to all previous censuses ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/br%c4%8dko_district#population ) , serbs never had a majority in br\u010dko . 
  so to me it 's hard to imagine that the bosniaks who have a majority there would agree to a peaceful handover of territory to rs . 
  i do n't think being split in two parts is not a problem . 
  firstly , it 's bosnia , so it 's dangerous . 
  secondly , it looks disgusting . 
   in my opinion , srpska should be given to serbia srpska is split in two parts which do not border , the same thing is with the bosniak parts . 
  the communist block of the eu : austria , croatia , denmark , hungary , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , the netherlands and spain . 
  the fence is for vip section with less density ? 
  what 's that tiny green area near canada ? 
  is it that french territory from top gear ? 
  probably some psychos . 
  we were also on the map last year or two years ago because some man decided to throw homemade bombs at railway tracks ... 
  well , chechnya ... 
  we will also not forget the atrocities committed under putin : *, 
   not that the real ones should have big value i agree for the smaller irrelevant ones , but in this case it 's one of our historically most important families and i find it disrespectful that some charlatans decided to just steal that name and they are getting away with it . 
  [ our fake nobility managed to get married into windsor family ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lady_nicholas_windsor ) . 
  okay , they are real nobility , but are actually quite a lower rank than the extinct princely frankopan family which they claim to be . 
   anti-eu sentiment in croatia is higher ( then in eg slovenia ) for this exact reason . 
  that 's completely untrue , according to the latest eurobarometer 18 % of croats and 19 % of slovenes have a '' total negative '' opinion of the eu , and both have a 35 % '' total positive '' . 
  '' neutral '' is at 46 % in croatia and 45 % in slovenia . 
  so the opinion on the eu is almost identical in both countries . 
   strong croat nationalism right . . that would only be the case if the symbol of the eu was a serbian flag . 
  that 's definitely not the reason . 
  okay , i understand the reason behind many of those we do n't participate in because they are connected to the common currency . 
  but divorce law , symbols of the eu ? 
  i do n't get why we do n't participate in that yet . 
  so now they will basically be able to change the constitution as they wish ? 
  it certainly helps in eliminating individuals with autocratic tendencies, 
  [ falange ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f6/friendsphoebe.jpg ), 
  yes, 
  starts with an f, 
   anyway , you stretch too much to draw too many parallels with russia even though you could draw the same ones with croatia . 
  paranoid much ? 
  the main difference is in croatia the elected president has to leave their party when they get elected which strips them of any power inside that party . 
  i tried to kind of continue to the title , as in `` croatian woman '', 
  well , all of it does make me think that vu\u010di\u0107 picked her because he sees her as the weakest threat to his throne , but that could easily backfire at him if she starts gaining more and more popularity . 
  you 've had a gay pm for years now , now you have both pm and president . 
  and a croatian !, 
  looks like the bosnians of reddit are bored again ... may the shit show begin . 
  again . 
  well , my visit to vatican was mostly the basilica and that 's where i saw the souvenir shop nuns , although i do think the person who was selling elevator tickets was not a nun , but it could have been , i do n't remember . 
  there are nuns who work in souvenir shops there ( which are btw the same as in rome but at least 30 % more expensive ), 
  not in vatican ? 
  would be more accurate if you switched germany and austria ^ ^ / s, 
  an emerald ? 
  notice the dotted line ... 
  i do n't think we have a pulse . 
  stop rubbing it in, 
   mooted name changes have included adding geographic qualifiers such as `` upper '' , `` new '' or `` northern '' macedonia . 
  northern macedonia seems reasonable . 
  49 % of croats and 54 % of slovenes according to this survey agree that lgbt people should have equal rights , so it 's not that much of a difference . 
  the referendum is , of course , a different story because in croatia there is no required quorum to make it valid , therefore the turnout was 37,9 % and of course the highly motivated catholics won by a landslide . 
  according to this survey , they would have won if the turnout was 100 % , but not with that margin . 
  slovenia had a similar case where the government made a law on marriage equality but was rejected in a referendum with a 63,5 % because of the same reason as our referendum , the turnout was almost identical at 36,4 % . 
  goddamn austria , who put it there !, 
  and malta, 
  a lot of them had high expectations from trump , especially when it comes to kosovo . 
  this is thanks to their tabloids , giving people false hopes , one of them even made up an interview with trump . 
  or you get an '' adverb '' with the main course . 
  [ it all started on twitter ] ( https://twitter.com/hrvatskagss/status/803151043790049280/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3a%2f%2fnet.hr%2fdanas%2fhrvatska%2fhgss-opet-ubija-na-twitteru-pogledajte-novi-status-hgss-a-koji-je-isao-na-racun-propasti-agrokora%2f ), 
  that would be equally odd . 
  and people just casually swimming next to it , whatever . 
  btw , the region that video is from is usually referred to as northwestern , while istria is just western or '' adriatic '' . 
  split already is a ruin anyway . 
   anyway , i 've always imagined ljubljana and budapest to be about the same size , learned today that that was very wrong . 
   until the next crisis , of course ( agrokor , anyone ? ), 
  if we ever start growing uncontrollably , there will be that expected huge earthquake in zagreb which will again ruin everything . 
  italy more introverted than finland ? 
  share some pls, 
  surely we have diamonds , then ? 
   yugoslavian estimates 100b $ dollars , lets say it 's bullshit and halve that number . 
  it probably is bullshit , because the foreign estimates are even less than half of that . 
  $ 100 billion is about the today 's gdp ppp of serbia . 
  yeah , 'cause the factories here were left intact lol . 
  then what about ina , borovo , saponia ... not even speaking of those which do n't exist anymore . 
  i did n't compare those two events , i compared it to the battlefield which croatia was on the course of 5 years . 
  that 's a lot of material damage , some of the towns are n't to this day completely renovated . 
  our tourism did n't recover that quickly , it reached the pre-war numbers in 2010,2011 and only now can we say that we are having a boom , partly thanks to the eu membership . 
  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bombing_of_banski_dvori https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/zagreb_rocket_attacks zagreb was bombed , vukovar was bombed , dubrovnik was bombed , osijek was bombed , half of the territory was occupied ... 
  check the cosequences that had on our tourism , if it did n't on the infrastructure . 
   you did n't have un sanctions , ** bombing ** , we did n't ? 
   thieftery aka privatisation ahahahaha, 
  these sound so much more hilarious in english, 
  no , no - you 're welcome !, 
  we supported her imperial highness ' claim to the throne years before you !,
