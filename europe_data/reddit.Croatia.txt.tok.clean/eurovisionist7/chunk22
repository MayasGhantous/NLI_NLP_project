  and venice ( our coast ), 
  [ been to his house , he would n't let me in :( ] ( http://www.dosadno.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/screenshot_12-3.png ), 
  what can i say , i 've met [ some new countries ] ( http://i.imgur.com/y91hglj.jpg ) recently . 
  let 's be serious , i am so out of your league . 
  you must do something about your looks . 
   it appears he never brought any flowers . 
  i assume [ these ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/borut_pahor%2c_jadranka_kosor_and_boris_tadi%c4%87_in_2010_02.jpg ) were from pahor ? 
  although krompirus has a serbian flair , it 's possible he did n't write in serbian , but in bosnian or montenegrin or croatian . 
   to this day noone in croatia speaks standard language !, 
  and ... this is relevant because ? 
  okay :  it was only mid 19th century when `` national wakening '' happened that the slavic language was accepted as universal so , no , slavic language was already universal before that . 
  slavic language was the language of the common folk in the areas of today 's croatia , we were even the last slavs to stop using the [ glagolitic script ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glagolitic_script ) . 
  croatian , kajkavian , chakavian , shtokavian , illyrian ... does n't matter what it was called , it 's slavic . 
  thanks , it would also help if people did n't write about 450 year-old events as if they personally lived through them yesterday . 
  it is also expected that the lack of support from austria is forgiven 4 centuries later , no need to highlight that . 
   when i think of it i kinda wished zrinski did let ottomans into gayland called vienna and not being fool of honorable croatian he decided to be . 
  this gave me diarrhea , especially the last part . 
  we could ask george soros for help ... 
  was ? 
  i did n't know that was stereotypical for montenegrins . 
  still not an excuse to push him like that . 
  phew , could be worse . 
  in what universe is that ? 
  if i lived in sarajevo i would weigh 200kg . 
  i think this one takes the haplogroup which has over 50 % . 
  if there is n't one , then it combines two of the biggest haplogroups . 
  '' it 's spring !, 
  see , i 'm cutting the grass . 
  okay ?! '', 
  i heard the ride in it is unbelievably expensive . 
  the prices would only be slightly higher than now , not dramatically , which is only good for us as a destination with a stable number of arrivals . 
  until now it has been poland which was the biggest recipient of eu funds , coming from contributors like italy and france . 
  well it 's up to poland to decide what 's best for them . 
  membership in the eurozone is still an important factor in further integration , that was my point . 
  french guiana is in the eu, 
  the solution is to join the eurozone , 
  i am still trying to figure out what 's it about , so wtf/10 . 
  u wot m8, 
  wow , romanian president [ walks past romanian flag ] ( https://youtu.be/3ma8myawztm?t=36 ), 
  63 % to be precise . 
  because the chinese do n't come enough, 
  the montenegrins will be delighted about that , no sarcasm . 
  wow , i can live with that . 
  ibiza being so close is a plus , too !, 
  no , it does . 
  so i live in o'donnell , is it a good neighborhood ? 
  to be fair , they did sort of get their revenge [ years later ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r3dvzdfxxo ) . 
  incest ? 
  is this also because of basements or habsburgs ? 
  yes , i am . 
  guildensterncrantz 's flair is croatian , not serbian . 
  okay , latvia , whatever . . 
  serbian flag does n't have a pineapple, 
  well , you have plenty of time to say goodbye until 2020/2021 , unless bill gates decides to pay off our debt tomorrow ... 
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_serbia_to_the_european_union you joking , ethiopia ? 
  i was about to write the similar thing - when we get below 60 % , that is the last obstacle . 
  i wonder how long that will take ... 
  i would not rather keep kuna , fuck kuna . 
  [ nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 zrinski ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nikola_%c5%a0ubi%c4%87_zrinski ) - also in hungary [ josip jela\u010di\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josip_jela%c4%8di%c4%87 ) - not so much in hungary, 
  ugh so it was bloody venetians who fucked us over !, 
   and then venice gave a strip of coast to the ottomans was n't it the other way around ? 
  i thought ragusa sold it to the ottomans because they were afraid venice would attack them . 
  now imagine if it remained [ this ] ( http://www.historytoday.com/sites/default/files/452px-philip_iii_of_spain.jpg ) . 
  you 're welcome . 
  / s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zf8z9-voue, 
  it 's a parody on our gastarbeiters , though croatian rap is often silly like this . 
  i do n't find his yelling and exaggerating funny at all , i do n't know what he is like off screen . 
  i never liked him , not sure why he is so popular when he mostly hates things, 
  jesus christ lithuania, 
  at least you 're not a random hip, 
  what are the best and the worst looking flags in europe in your opinion ? 
  for me , the best looking one is finland 's , it 's simple and nice . 
  the absolute worst is kosovo , imo . 
  you should just make this one abdicate , too , so you have a 12 yo queen . 
  croatian and '' first foreign language '' , english or german , are both compulsory from grade 1 of elementary school until the end of high school . 
  [ the black queen ] ( http://www.secret-zagreb.com/zagrebblog//2011/09/black-queen.html ) . 
  i would n't exactly call it scary today , but for the people of the 15th century it was probably terrifying . 
  most of the ex-communist block is growing rapidly and the rest are also growing . 
  only a very unlucky sequence of events can stop europe from going forward . 
  [ hermann boll\u00e9 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermann_boll%c3%a9 ) [ giorgio da sebenico ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/giorgio_da_sebenico ) known in croatia as * juraj dalmatinac *, 
  chefs , waiters , receptionists , maids, 
  maybe it 's the same guy who kept reporting everyone on / r/askeurope who used us spelling, 
  did you also forget about your northern neighbours or did you intentionally decide not to include them ? 
  hmm , you never know when it comes to our president , it does n't hurt to contact [ her office ] ( http://predsjednica.hr/stranica/13/ ) . 
  our ex-pm is active on twitter , so [ you can ask her directly ] ( https://twitter.com/_jadranka_kosor?lang=hr ) . 
  eastern germany , bavaria , poland , czech republic , slovakia , hungary , slovenia , croatia , northern italy , western ukraine , vojvodina , transylvania, 
  well i did n't want to go in show business , there 's lots of them , but i figured serbia would beat us with creatures like [ this ] ( http://arhiva.alo.rs/resources/img/10-04-2014/single_news/1112643-17.jpg ) . 
  of course . 
  i support her when she says that she does n't have to wear a pantsuit to be taken seriously , but imo this is a bit too much like something on reality tv . 
  [ \u017deljko kerum ] ( http://cdn-static.rtl-hrvatska.hr/repository/images/e/0/e062205803e1eb11c41347ce3fea50a6.jpg?v=20 ) - former mayor of split [ kolinda grabar kitarovi\u0107 ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/kolinda_press_21092016.jpg ) - the president . 
  i do n't have anything against her dressing like this , everyone has a right to dress as they like , but i have the right to notice that she very often dresses like a starlet . 
  diminutive of * \u0161os * , which means skirt, 
  no , translated to croatian that 's '' central croatia '', 
  watching at other people 's car at the stop light or as you overtake them , owning a bmw x6 , '' reserving '' a beach spot with a towel , not allowing your dog on the sofa, 
  like question , like answer . 
  afaik * kaj * , * \u010da * and * \u0161to * and all of their alternatives are all slavic . 
  if i 'm not mistaken , only in slovenia and croatia we use * kaj * . 
  i know most languages have loanwords , just wanted to point out that it does n't mean kajkavian and chakavian are any more purer slavic than shtokavian because they do n't have turkish loanwords . 
  if anything , [ thanks to this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_linguistic_purism ) , they probably are n't . 
  btw , i 'm from the kajkavian area and i fully agree with everything else he said .
