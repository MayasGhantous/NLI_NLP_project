  depends on whether the walkers can swim . 
  there 's lots of uninhabited islands in croatia where i could try to escape to . 
  if that would n't be an option , i estimate my chances at ~ 0 %, 
  yes , but in croatian that would be a very over-dramatic telenovela way of saying * neprijatelj *, 
  so apparently 50 % of words in standard croatian are loans ; from hungarian , italian , german , turkish , greek ... 
  okay , i agree , there 's lots of loans . 
  however , that does n't mean kajkavian and chakavian are pure slavic/croatian , maybe even less so . 
  kajkavian is very german influenced and chakavian is almost italian . 
  for serbo-croatian it largely depends where you are from , though . 
  most of these words you posted look like they 're from a bosnian slang , would n't really apply to croatia . 
  there is an idea of having 5-6 official regions with a fair level of autonomy instead of the 21 counties we have now . 
  the regions would be based mostly on historical regions ; dalmatia , slavonia , istria ... 
  roma ( ~ 16.000 ), 
  but from what i 've been able to hear , you pronounce it more softly than the poles . 
  for example , czech [ ko\u010dka ] ( https://forvo.com/search/ko%c4%8dka/ ) and polish [ do zobaczenia ] ( https://forvo.com/word/do_zobaczenia/#pl ) . 
  i notice this because we have a similar thing in south slavic languages . 
  i loved it the last time i saw it , which was a long time ago . 
  a great movie to watch with the family . 
  i could probably at least be able to tell that it 's western slavic . 
  then probably i would look for the hard/specific ** \u010d ** sounds and , if it does n't have them , it 's not polish . 
  so then it 's either czech or slovak ... 
  - [ croatian handjobs ] ( https://hr-hr.facebook.com/croatianhandjobs/ ) - a parody on [ this ] ( https://ip.index.hr/remote/index.hr/images2/rucni_rad625.jpg?maxwidth=625 ) , a literal translation of '' handmade '' in croatian - * kolindiranje * - named after kolinda , our president . 
  it 's when you take a photo pretending to be doing something . 
  [ example ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/kolinda_pixsell_130720151.jpg ) . 
  well , being from one of the countries that joined in that period , i support it . 
  however , croats were salty in 2007 when romania and bulgaria joined , because people thought the eu turned a blind eye when they let them in . 
  in the text it says * babi\u010d * originates from trieste , though to me it sounds herzegovinian croatian ( maybe because the people i know with that surname are from there ) . 
  for apartments , like [ this ] ( http://gpzagorje.hr/upload/publish/36/thumb/jalkovekoj2_51aa623dc29a8_705x490c.jpg ) or [ this ] ( http://www.artdomus.hr/images/srebrnjak-urbana_vila-13-01-1323169431.jpg ) . 
  the smaller ones are usually more luxurious , but not always , especially if they are on an unattractive location . 
  for houses , it depends on the region , money , preferences ... 
  in istria and on the coast , it 's very often a modern version of the traditional stone house like [ this ] ( http://www.croatiacharterholidays.com/tolteam/upload/objekti/324/v11854.jpg ) or [ this for the richer ] ( http://www.montonatours.com/repository/images/products/bajkinisara/sara7_mala.jpg ), 
  mari\u0107 ( derived from maro/mara , child of maro/mara ) some other more interesting common ones , not following the order : kos ( blackbird ) , car ( emperor ) , ban ( title ) , herceg ( title ) , poljak ( pole ) , bo\u0161njak ( bosniak ) , lon\u010dar ( potter ), 
  i have n't seen any portrayal ( or have forgotten about it ) outside of ex-yugoslavia . 
  and that is usually them making fun of how we talk . 
  cabo verde , not honorary but a full member . 
  it is quite poor but at the same time quite a developed democracy . 
  it has a population of about 500.000 and around 600.000 tourist arrivals , which could be much higher if they joined the eu . 
  no , for the last ~ 900 years there is n't a native dynasty . 
  they want either a habsburg or a croatian noble to be elected . 
  the last two kings were illegal according to our constitution , so their descendants are not considered as pretenders ; the kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107s because our parliament never ratified the unification with serbia and the savoys because today 's croatia is not a legal successor of the independent state of croatia . 
  it 's mostly variations of the current flag . 
  [ these two ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/croatian_flags_of_the_1990s.png ) are fairly common . 
  the first one has a reputation of being a fascist flag because the first field on the checkerboard is white , but i fail to see any logic behind that claim , our coa was historically always like that . 
  the only fascist flag is [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/flag_of_independent_state_of_croatia.svg/1024px-flag_of_independent_state_of_croatia.svg.png ) , i 'd say it 's popular among parts of the diaspora . 
  i guess [ this one ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/croatia-1848.gif ) is popular among monarchists . 
  it 's a competition with different countries and people want to see how their country will do , who will vote for them and so on . 
  it also has a reputation of being over the top and kitschy . 
  but you ca n't see performances like that even by the biggest world pop stars , sometimes it backfires and then for some that 's even better - humorous . 
  take [ croatia 2017 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sya_gixsw0 ) as an example . 
  besides , it 's so european , what 's there not to like about it . 
  yes , 200 million people watch it every year . 
  that 's not exactly a small number . 
  well iceland sells cans with fresh air , so it must be them, 
  maybe it 's his surname , i know in serbia and montenegro lazar is a common first name . 
  if not , naming the funeral home * lazar 's hip * is equally funny . 
  babina guzica - grandma 's ass babin kuk - grandma 's hip prdu\u0161a vela - big fart grudnjak - bra grdoselo - ugly village apatija - apathy nebojse - do n't be afraid krivi put - wrong way [ more here ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/25-things-to-know-about-croatia/16503-grandma-s-ass-to-grandma-s-hip-25-things-to-know-about-croatian-place-names ), 
  [ vatican ] ( https://www.passportindex.org/countries/va.png ) . 
  first time using it unsarcastically as an answer . 
  that material looks like actual leather ... [ hungary ] ( https://www.passportindex.org/countries/hu.png ) also is nice with the iconic st.stephen 's crown , but that font is too large . 
  if they have the documentation which proves emigration from croatia , great-grandchildren of the emigrants have the right to the citizenship . 
  however , you can acquire citizenship even beyond that , if you can prove that you belong to the croatian nation , for example , by participating in croatian associations in your country etc. 
  yes , i did n't know it had a name !, 
  i thought it was just a thing in my household . 
  however , i could n't have it often , just when we knew exactly where the eggs came from . 
  we were careful with raw eggs , you never know . 
   is zakosutra used/a word ( 2 days after tomorrow ) ? 
  i heard naksutra and nakju\u010der , but yeah that should work . 
  ugh , well , how about * prekosutra * = the day after tomorrow ? 
  or * prekju\u010der * = the day before yesterday ? 
  ** uhljeb ** * is a person whose life tactics , ideology , practice and evolutionary instinct for existence is reduced to uncritical opportunism . 
  the person concerned is loyal to his party , the local sheriff , company or anything else as long as some of these entities would secure their livelihoods . 
  thereby acting contrary to all noble impulses and ideals , utterly instinctive , reduced the survival instinct and the end of the stand with the source of their existence , not caring if the same source is destroying other people 's lives , sinks the future of entire generations , and ultimately may perform genocide of whole people . 
  the same can not rebel against his party , nor that the same will not rebel against his country or if the same country carried out military aggression on a world level . 
  * in other words , it 's a derogatory term for public sector and state-owned companies workers . 
  it 's not wrong to say it because that 's how i see turkey . 
  others are free to have their own view . 
  to be honest , i do n't know anything about armenia and georgia beside their capital cities . 
  turkey is on the crossroads , i would n't say they are strictly european , but i would n't group them with the middle east or iran , either . 
  they are their own thing . 
  i like how they added `` picking mushrooms '' , it must have been a common excuse . 
   people who stop their car ( also because of lack of fuel ) or pick mushrooms are arrested and released after interrogations and payment of fines . 
  : o the road itself looks kind of creepy , like a generic horror movie road where something jumps out from the forest . 
  now i know how to avoid paying for visa when i want to go to russia , 
  i 'm guessing there is n't a visa requirement or even a border control to drive through that ? 
  well both is okay for a silly word play . 
  yeah , i saw the photos before and after . 
  quite impressive that they managed to save it . 
   there was a great white shark attack near vis , croatia in 2009 . 
  ironically , the victim was a slovene called damjan ** pesek ** = doggie ( we call sharks '' sea dogs '' ) . 
  he suffered great injuries but his leg was saved . 
  no , just fire and earthquake drills . 
  the probability of a shooting happening at a school , or anywhere else , is very low . 
  '' razvali ! '', 
  - demolish/destroy it !, 
  what better to clear your mind than some klapa music : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfnj0rno_xe, 
   both countries lie in the eastern third of the continent of europe not really , if going by the strict definition of europe . 
  russia is huge and depending on the definition , both countries probably even lie on the western half of the continent ( or a central third ? ) . 
  west-east divide is a leftover from the cold war times , so no one exactly wants to be associated with the east even if it is geographically correct to call them eastern europe , the countries are sort of rebranding themselves . 
  you might want to start with not calling poland and lithuania eastern europe , they do n't like it . 
  their first assumption would probably be that the person is a croatian-american who decided to live/study in their ancestors ' homeland .
