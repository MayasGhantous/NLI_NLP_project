  descendants of croatian emigrants have privileges when applying to universities so it would n't be something unusual . 
  there is a saying that you are as rich as the number of languages you speak . 
  so basically it opens much more opportunities in life , you ca n't even get a job today without knowing at least english . 
  hehe , it tastes better than it sounds !, 
  same goes for cockta . 
  i like [ pipi ] ( https://image.dnevnik.hr/media/images/810x540/mar2017/61333973-pipi.jpg ) more . 
  well , i imagined zombie apocalypse like it is in the walking dead : constant threat , you have to fight them and stab them in their heads , be careful so they do n't bite you , put their liquids on yourself so they ca n't smell the life in you ... definitely not something i would survive . 
  how do i know ? 
  - because it sometimes happens to me that i trip over my own foot . 
  if there was an option to go to a vacation house and chill , then obviously i would do so . 
  that 's great , i hope they introduce it here . 
  as of now , cigarettes are available everywhere . 
  i am not a smoker and i ca n't find the prices online , but from what i 've been able to read it 's around 3-4 euros on average . 
  zombie apocalypse - carbon monoxide , cyanide or what is available . 
  i 'm definitely not staying alive in that , if it 's anything like on the tv and games , so why even try . 
  for other situations , it 's likely they wo n't reach remote places like new zealand or fiji , so i would try to figure out how to reach them . 
  but for some places like veglia people might not know what you are talking about , so you 'll have to learn how to say krk . 
  he 's okay , standards were lowered with trump . 
  we do n't have a problem with that like the other countries seem to , if someone has croatian ancestry and they happen to be successful , we 'll happily claim them as one of us , i.e. 
  lorde , eric bana , john kasich etc. 
  pizza hut , it almost opened years ago but somehow the plans failed :(, 
  hmm , not sure about new year 's , but now that you 've reminded me , there was a 2001 : a space travesty like a month ago . 
  great movie :d, 
  i guess because it sank in april , but they do play it in other months , too . 
  when i was a child it was on saturday and then there was a replay on sunday , i would watch both ... and every year like that . 
  home alone in december and titanic in april . 
  i do n't watch tv enough to know the rest exactly , i think jason bourne and taken are also very often on tv . 
  we have a solid relationship with italy , but i feel like there is still a passive-aggressive distrust on both sides . 
  there is no reason for our relationship not to be even better than neutral , but the people still observe each other with squinty eyes . 
  i might be wrong , but that 's my impression . 
  distrust and dislike between serbs and croats resulted in another war , so there 's that . 
  it will take some time until two nations trust each other again , if ever ... 
  hehe , seeing those protests , i would n't exclude that he * honestly * got scared . 
  kind of inconvenient for him to have the presidential palace in the city centre , our president is in the middle of a forest on a hill above zagreb . 
   almost bordering with us : we do actually share a border in two separate places in the adriatic . 
  [ ban josip jela\u010di\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/josip_jela%c4%8di%c4%87 ) - regarded as a national hero in croatia , but a traitor in hungary because of the side he was on in the revolution . 
  the main square in zagreb is named after him and there is [ a statue of him ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2qgfjfzvqbs/tzl_uvbkzwi/aaaaaaaaal0/n3f0qum5txo/s1600/banje.jpg ) in the middle . 
  it used to be in the direction of budapest , but now that we are okay with the hungarians it 's facing south . 
  yeah , why not ? 
  i guess when she learned spanish it was n't that difficult to learn portuguese ? 
  i have n't heard her speak it yet , though , only heard her speak english and spanish once with the pope . 
  she speaks english , spanish and portuguese . 
  the pm speaks english , french and italian . 
  wow , interesting , did n't see the u.s. 
  : / i can relate to what he wrote , makes me very pissed about our politicians in hr ... 
  yeah , there is that sentiment apparently . 
  [ one of the presidential candidates in this last election wrote about it in the washington post a few days ago ] ( https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2017/07/13/democracy-in-the-balkans-is-under-siege-and-the-west-is-looking-away/?utm_term=.87ca1a1d4922 ) . 
  i wo n't say there are n't fishy things about their ruling party , as far as i 'm able to tell being in a completely different country , it looks like the people hate it yet somehow they get +50 % in every election . 
  well they ca n't blame serbia for that when they vote for the same politicians as them , take a look at the last two elections : [ parliamentary 2016 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_parliamentary_election,_2016 ) , [ presidential 2017 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serbian_presidential_election,_2017 ), 
  i like the old tatras because they heat your ass in the winter :d, 
  those are n't the only two models that we have . 
  here , all of them : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/trams_in_zagreb#gallery, 
  rijeka or the surroundings . 
  they scream and cry when we score . 
  even '' demi\u017eone '' ? 
  that means that bottle you put alcohol in , in croatian . 
  well that was informative !, 
  edit : also ,  med\u016fzo jellyfish ? 
  that 's a creative insult if true !, 
   kokos lol, 
  i know we have jamnica but radenska is equally popular . 
  every summer there 's a few, 
  no , i know that they say it in bosnia though, 
  well i put a picture . 
  how do you call it ? 
  it was n't , just wanted to point it out , 
  [ kinder lada ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/kindrlada_pinterest_24032017.jpg ) - it was a popular chocolate spread in yugoslavia , does n't exist anymore , but the name remains in use [ eurocrem ] ( https://www.eurofooddeals.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/takovo-eurocream-500g.png ) - same as the above , except it still exists . 
  those who do n't say * kinder lada * say * eurokrem * [ smoki ] ( https://nutristo.com/photo/show/715 ) - any flips snack [ radenska ] ( http://www.jatrgovac.com/usdocs/radenska-classic-1l.jpg ) - any sparkling water ... 
  etc. , many more . 
  triggered a bit . 
  we have a long tradition with tourism , it did n't start when we became independent , but long , long before . 
  the war ruined it , so i guess you can say croatia was `` re-discovered '' . 
  do n't know how to answer that , obviously not . 
  it 's only internet warriors who claim that . 
  slovakia is also a great skiing destination, 
  an area flowing with milk and honey , that 's the most common perception . 
  i already do and i would n't change . 
  i would live for a year in slovakia or czech republic to learn the language . 
  it was posted by die zeit , according to our media . 
  apparently it 's about the three seas initiative in general , our president even reacted to it denying it 's against anyone or anything , but rather * for * development of central and eastern europe . 
  they wo n't let us before because you will veto us if they try to do that . 
  it was reported here that some german papers were writing so , yes . 
  i have nothing against it , but i think it 's hypocritical when those who support it call the poland/croatia lng terminals a '' us trojan horse in europe '', 
  croatia has a better geographical position for starts . 
  for a german it 's not that far away by car and for a slovene it 's a spitting distance away . 
  compared to montenegro , croatia also has a better road infrastructure and quite a few more airports . 
  seeing the answers , it 's extra nice to have poland in europe when you 're the second most catholic after them . 
  but for what i know , they do n't act all that catholic when they come here . 
  if you sit on the corner of a table , you will never get married . 
  if you have hiccups , someone is thinking about you . 
  draft causes cold , ear infection and even pneumonia . 
  unfortunate name, 
  questions with a negation in the beginning are usually passive-aggressive . 
  everywhere i visited in europe the people were nice to me . 
  and those coastal holiday homes from the people of zagreb are almost always around rijeka . 
  but there 's also a lot of people who are not originally from zagreb so they have parents/grandparents on the coast . 
  it 's quite common . 
  and it appears 99,99 % of croats who have extended family in canada have them in mississauga , ontario . 
  i 've never seen it before lol , i only heard about belgium not being a real country, 
  and albania and montenegro,
