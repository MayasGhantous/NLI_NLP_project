  the marten . 
  i do like it , it 's unique in the sea of eagles as national symbols of other countries . 
  it was a joke ... 
  i have no clue , i would expect the ones who have the most investment or interest in croatia to be the most crucial allies . 
  in the 1990s germany and austria were the most persistent lobbyists in the international institutions , while hungary was selling us weapons , so perhaps it would be similar today if something happens . 
  unless jobbik wins election in hungary and they decide croatia is their rightful clay ... 
  okay , this is a bit of my grandma 's propaganda , not sure if they 're actual stereotypes , but i believed it when i was a child : - italians eat cats . 
  - germans fart in public whenever they have to and no one cares about it . 
  they drive gigantic cars , eat fast food , drink cola , own a gun , they are talkative and not the brightest . 
  rappers are usually a part of the underground music scene , usually the songs are tragicomic , about life of the lower class , politicians or just trolling . 
  there are exceptions like tbf and connect which are more mainstream . 
  the language is croatian . 
  austria-hungary had a couple of overseas territories . 
  in that case , i would also like to know if the colonies of the dubrovnik republic also count . 
  and austria-hungary . 
  [ they have adult versions , too !, 
  ] ( http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/drugfuelled-orgy-broken-up-by-police-in-vatican-city/news-story/ffcfcf9cf9488b51d628246df9e543ac ), 
  it 's not that difficult for 5/6 of our land neighbours . 
  for hungary i would also like to know , probably it 's either english or hands . 
  the vatican is pretty wild , there 's always some scandals including orgies in the news . 
  my opinion changes but usually it 's finland . 
  though i also like the netherlands , i wish they changed red to orange so that we can remove our coa . 
  [ \u017deljka marki\u0107 ] ( http://static.hr.n1info.com/picture/41208/jpeg/1.jpg ) - manipulative bitch , wants to make croatia a catholic version of isis, 
  well he is an ethnic bosniak , you ca n't choose that . 
  but he considers himself a muslim croat . 
  okay , if you say so , but the 1940s topics are not that ideal either . 
  his name is zlatko hasanbegovi\u0107 . 
  i do n't know his stance on refugees , that 's not really an important topic in croatia . 
  the `` leader '' of the far-right is a muslim , he even prays like one in public , but his supporters do n't care . 
  it 's quite hilarious to me , to be completely honest . 
  i 'm okay with tusk being there, 
  flowerpot ? 
  '' were you born on a boat ? '', 
  well not sure about the rest of the country , but juding by my grandpa 's stories everyone was fucking with everyone in zagreb when he was young after ww2 . 
  perhaps it then came with the communism , but i would n't be surprised if in rural areas it came much later . 
  because they eat a lot of red and processed meat instead of fish . 
  it 's quite ironic , we export 90 % of our tuna to japan , for example . 
  one good thing about being a religious country is that it makes people eat fish on fridays . 
  but colorectal cancer is still the 2nd most common death cause : /, 
  i do n't think we pickle fish , we are not big fans of fish in general . 
  but pickling vegetables for the winter is quite common ( it 's called * zimnica * ) . 
  especially sauerkraut , beetroot , bell pepper , cucumber , green tomato , carrot and asparagus . 
  the best thing in our case is tourism and the fact that you do n't have to travel to a foreign country for a holiday . 
  the worst thing are jealous neighbours ^ ^ / s, 
  we have statehood day on the 25th of june and independence day on the 8th of october . 
  it 's confusing since there are two and many people do n't even know which is which . 
  the celebrations are also just politicians holding speeches , nothing special . 
  some more patriotic people put flags up on their houses/windows , so maybe they celebrate at home . 
  idk , some starlet for bill gates . 
  and then confiscate his assets in the name of the republic . 
  before the communism : [ dra\u0161kovi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_dra%c5%a1kovi%c4%87 ) , [ peja\u010devi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_peja%c4%8devi%c4%87 ) , [ bona ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/house_of_bona ) , [ batthy\u00e1ny / ba\u0107an ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batthy%c3%a1ny ) etc. 
  after the communism , it 's mostly new money who are famous : chilean-croatian luk\u0161i\u0107 , slavica ecclestone and her daughters , todori\u0107 ( they had a collapse just this year , they own/owned supermarkets ) , tedeschi ( food supply business ) ... 
  because smoking makes you thin , something europeans care more about than americans . 
  [ that era is over ] ( http://slobodnadalmacija.hr/dalmacija/split/clanak/id/135048/nema-vise-ruganja-pastetari-su-mrtvi-cesi-su-galantni-gosti ) . 
  i 'll stick only to the not so extreme ones : italians - '' digi\u0107i '' and '' pa\u0161tari '' - the first one insinuates that they use verb * dire * ( to say ) a lot , the second i assume because that they like pasta ( ? ), 
  germans - '' \u0160vabi '' - after swabians slovenes - '' zlovenci '' - instead of '' slovenci '' , which is a correct spelling , because * zlo * means evil . 
  also '' janezi '' because * janez * is a common name there , but that 's not always used as a derogatory term . 
  serbs - '' trofazni '' ( three-phased ) - because they cross themselves with three fingers, 
  there is a dutch way of doing it, 
  i never put salt on watermelon . 
  i do eat melons with rum , you should try it if you have n't already . 
  has n't that already been done with esperanto ? 
  i mean , i would learn it in some futuristic utopian society where it 's promoted by the eu , but as of now i do n't think it would be of any worth to learn an artificial language . 
  * piti krv na slamku * - to drink one 's blood with a straw ( to purposely annoy someone , making them furious ) * krstiti vino * - to baptize the wine ( to mix wine with water ) * kao drvena marija * - like a wooden mary ( to just stand somewhere and be useless ), 
  usually people do n't know how to roll the letter r , so they get scared of all the consonants surrounding it , while it 's actually there to act as a vowel . 
  nicely demonstrated in the word [ cvr\u010dci ] ( https://forvo.com/search/cvr%c4%8dci/ ) . 
  but in general also any consonants which a foreigner would n't find logical to stand next to each other are difficult to pronounce , like h and v in [ hvar ] ( https://forvo.com/search/hvar/hr/ ) or lj in [ ljubljana ] ( https://forvo.com/search/ljubljana/hr/ ) . 
  [ klapa singing ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/klapa ) , there 's quite a few groups which are very popular . 
  for individual artists ; rarely any do the mainstream world pop . 
  ww2 underground tunnels in zagreb , for the brave . 
  some of them are abandoned but not closed . 
  some of them , in the city centre , have recently been opened and they work as shortcuts , [ they are n't scary anymore ] ( http://www.zagreb.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/160706_tunel-gric-4-e1467800653327.jpg ) . 
  well , we certainly do . 
  the question is whether we will manage to join the eurozone before it happens or will we join after . 
  it 's okay if we catch up with the rest later , but i hope the eu does n't cut the funding to us and those who are working on the further integration . 
  and krtek and a je to !, 
  the cravat , so the men were spared from wearing collars . 
  the disproportionaly long coastline and border are are going to become more and more tricky to maintain , but otherwise i do n't see it as a bad thing , 
  i was used to saying that croatia has 4.5 million people but now i round it up to 4 million . 
  it never changed here but some people still use german marks for the same things your parents do francs . 
  i do n't think so , but i 've never paid attention . 
  not many buildings with 13 floors here . 
  i do n't have one specific perception of the regions in my head . 
  of course , the netherlands , for example , is always western europe . 
  germany , on the other hand , is both western and central europe . 
  the baltic countries are both eastern and northern . 
  poland is both central and eastern etc. , you get the point . 
  okay , correct , technically ljubljana avenue was split in two . 
  but all three are the same road in reality . 
   zagreb avenue ( ex ljubljana avenue ) actually it 's not ex , it 's just split in three parts now . 
  from west to east : ljubljana avenue --  zagreb avenue --  slavonia avenue . 
  it makes sense , '' ljubljana '' part is towards ljubljana , '' zagreb '' part is through the city and '' slavonia '' part is towards slavonia . 
  prfekt * same as srtnli instead of sertainly , there 's no need for so many vowels . 
  [ here , eurostat explored it ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/housing_statistics ), 
  the last parliamentary election : sms - sasvim mala stranka ( completely small party ) a lot of well-known and even prominent people were on the list . 
  some of their slogans , they used generic phrases which other parties keep repeating , but made them opposite : * politics before profession !, 
  * * words , not deeds !, 
  * * future is in the elderly !, 
  * also , [ bruna esih ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smcguwaf5gw ) copying marine le pen 's campaign video , it 's not a joke but still hilarious . 
  i 'm from zagreb and i like that accent the most tbh,
