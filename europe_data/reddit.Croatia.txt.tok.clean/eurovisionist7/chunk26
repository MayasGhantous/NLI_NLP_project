  [ animatori - komarci ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmu66apd8bo ) ( mosquitoes ) [ hladno pivo - zimmer frei ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm9sic3bcc8 ) ( vacant rooms ) [ daleka obala - morska vila ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uaj0yzufmq ) ( sea fairy ) we have lots of summer hits which are played over and over , but these three i think everyone knows . 
  the last one is also the '' anthem '' of our handball team . 
  what are the meanings ? 
  red for paprika , white for ... 
  and marko maruli\u0107 , a.k.a. 
  the father of croatian literature . 
  i 'm from zagreb , they yell at me in dalmatia when i call the sea '' water '', 
  absolutely , i am not denying that , i was just talking about my own experience and k\u00f6ppen climate classification . 
   geographically it 's not mediterranean . 
  useless edit , look at my reply above , i said just that . 
  technically on the adriatic , but yes . 
  why ? 
  i also thought the same xd, 
  it 's in your language :d, 
  i find that even more ridiculous , i do n't understand how people can be that stupid to not be able to memorize the slightly different sentence and word formation they listen to every day . 
  i 've just had a discussion with a slovenian complaining that in istria they always expect them to speak croatian , so it works both ways . 
  i agree that it 's not that difficult to learn a couple of sentences in a closely related language when you travel there . 
  the parts of lisbon i 've been to were all very clean , maybe i 've only been to popular touristic areas . 
  and not only lisbon , but other towns were also like that . 
  i expected it would be more like in southern italy . 
  we learn it in elementary school once , at young age , then a lot of us forget the lyrics till the end and eventually learn them thanks to football . 
  our lyrics are n't violent , it 's about how much you love the country , mentioning rivers , mountains etc. 
  i think our anthem is okay , not one of the best like the french or russian ones , but it serves its purpose . 
  it could have been better , though . 
  well , dalmatians are used to not even been understood by other croats . 
  slovene is n't considered different enough to actually be learned , people usually assume they can understand each other so they do n't bother . 
  but it can actually be tricky for dalmatians to understand you and you them , although , if you both speak slowly , it should work the same as with czechs , slovaks and poles . 
  neither do we , only a narrow coastal strip does , but people usually associate us with that climate . 
  besides , i was there in the summer , it appeared mediterranean to me . 
  and all the data i 've seen put most of portugal in mediterranean climate , only small part in the north is not . 
  geographically not , maybe i should have said '' southerners '' , but even parts of chile , california , argentina and australia are grouped into mediterranean climate . 
  yes , they have introduced people counters in dubrovnik which are in effect since this year due to overcrowding and because it 's a unesco site . 
  this means nothing for individuals , but groups are n't able to enter inside the walls until some of them leave . 
   also , many signs in croatian and italian , though i 've been told it 's only near the coast like that that was probably istria , there is an italian minority there , so that 's why . 
  as for german , well , wealthy austrians started spending their winters here way back in a-h , basically starting the tourism , then with mass summer tourism germans became the most numerous guests , so it developed in that direction . 
  and it comes useful if you want to work in germany , so it 's a 2in1 deal . 
   also zagreb is full of koreans . 
  yes , i read it 's because some korean romantic reality show is filmed in zagreb , so they come like crazy . 
  i guess [ fado ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fado ) also had an effect on them . 
  edit : i get the joke , i know portugal is not literally on the mediterranean , but i guess other people do n't consider it a mediterran due to climate and culture ? 
  germany 2 . 
  italy 5 . 
  poland 6 . 
  czech republic 7 . 
  france 9 . 
  hungary 10 . 
  slovakia only now noticing uk and france are 7th and 8th , which makes me very happy , as it means we are attracting more than just traditional central europeans . 
  hungary and slovakia at 9th and 10th is also surprising , they should come more . 
  [ source ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_croatia#arrivals_by_country ), 
  as a child , it used to be any western country and all the diversity . 
  i still have in memory black women in vienna speaking german , it was very odd to me . 
  more recently , it 's portugal . 
  the people there were very mild and sometimes shy , while i expected them to be loud , hot blooded mediterraneans . 
  it was also very clean , i also did n't expect that in portugal for some reason . 
  in what way are they arrogant ? 
  big country superiority complex or something else ? 
  i 've never had that experience with russian tourists btw . 
  for a moment i thought it 's your son, 
  mandatory sterilization and stricter breeder laws could at least reduce their numbers . 
  the only ones that count are , i guess , italians in istria ( counting serbs as not speaking the native language would be stupid ) . 
  i do n't mind them , they have all the rights to use exclusively their own language , although they usually speak both italian and croatian . 
  the saddest thing about it is that it can all be solved easily , there just needs to be a little of political will . 
  i also have witnessed every single bosnian i know having irrational fear of dogs . 
  and they are disgusted because i let my spoiled cavalier on the couch . 
  because a lot of our today 's territory was under italy . 
  in istria and rijeka they especially adore him . 
  ( of course there are also those who absolutely despise him ), 
  i do n't think they are yugosnostagics , here in croatia , they just have respect for tito for his role in the ww2 . 
   99 percent of those who liked him will pass away in matter of few years what is the life expectancy in serbia ? 
  because i know a lot of young and middle aged people here who like him . 
  their president ? 
  he is quite likable , even here people like him . 
  the pm , on the other hand , seems so awkward . 
  true , i do n't know how exactly it would work , but if you have some serious illness and want to go treat it in italy , if you are a passport holder , surely it 's not difficult to become a resident . 
  i know a case of an australian croat who did that ( in croatia ) . 
  free healthcare . 
  also , * eu passports * vs. * international passports * lines at the airport . 
  the best is to go to the nearest israeli embassy or consulate , or send them an e-mail . 
  but i do n't know how israel fits into your desires , since you can travel much more with a us passport than with an israeli one . 
  with an israeli passport you would n't even be allowed into some countries , like the uae or malaysia . 
  also , you do n't have to renounce your us citizenship if you are eligible for israeli citizenship , both countries accept dual citizenship . 
  that 's probably because our meat burek is not really on the same level as in bosnia , they have bakeries which only sell burek and of course it 's so much better . 
   serbia says `` burek with cheese '' that 's the most common one here , too . 
  in fact , i think it became * the burek * , while the other one is just * burek with meat *, 
  well , check you ancestors , i think it was luxembourg that offers citizenship until 2019 to individuals who have a grandparent ( or even a great-grandparent ) from there ... 
  what is happening in the us ? 
  why do n't you just move to hawaii and ignore the politics ? 
  idk , i always perceived american history as boring compared to european ( lack of royal families ) , so i do n't really know exactly a lot about the subject . 
  i would say alde or the greens . 
  for epp it depends , i do n't think fidesz is particularly pro-federalization . 
  aesthetically , i prefer the current japanese flag . 
  i am not familiar with the controversy around it , i assume it 's similar to our '' first white field on coa '' thing . 
  i 've never heard of a croat buying that in a store , but i guess [ this one ] ( http://www.maraska.hr/proizvodi/grupa-1-strong-alcoholic-drinks/kategorija-2-strong-alcoholic-drinks/proizvod-21-slivovitz-plum-brandy ) or [ this one ] ( http://www.maraska.hr/proizvodi/grupa-1-strong-alcoholic-drinks/kategorija-2-strong-alcoholic-drinks/proizvod-53-travarica-dalmatika ) . 
  no , it 's the princess of '' i do n't have time prepare all those ingredients '',

  lol i 've heard stories of tourists thinking dubrovnik was built by the hbo , but i do n't know if i believe there really is someone that stupid . 
  5km long sand beaches like the ones on an ocean . 
  i 'm surprised they have it on the entire day . 
  i use my ac when it 's unbearably hot and usually turn it off after an hour . 
  it is believed that it 's not healthy to sleep with an ac on and it 's not good to be directly in front of it .
