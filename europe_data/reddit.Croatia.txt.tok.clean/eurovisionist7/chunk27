  it 's a cultural thing , i guess , wind/breeze/cold is blamed for all the diseases there are . 
  besides that , it could also be that they are saving electricity . 
  they will never into relevance with that attitude, 
   `` yugo '' for people from former yugoslavia is sometimes used as a slur damn \u0160vabi !, 
  how is that even a comparison ? 
  of course they are basically the same thing when compared to a belarusian , siberian etc. 
  because it 's implying that it does n't matter if i 'm from istria or siberia , i 'm a slav so it 's basically the same thing . 
   i think it 's pretty cool to be a slav , to be honest . 
  the best folk costumes by far !, 
  it would be weird if someone said that , but i would n't mind unless it was said in a condescending way . 
  though i would like if that person was less ignorant . 
   peter dinklage i thought his accent on got , if he attempted to do british , was really bad . 
  but i 'm not an expert so maybe to a british person it sounded native ? 
  well there 's lots of surnames which are common on both sides of the border . 
   edit : oh , she was born to a croatian jewish mother , and a father of slovene-croat heritage . 
  oh , okay , in this case it is slovene , but there are croatian furlans as well . 
  okay , they ( goran vi\u0161nji\u0107 and mira furlan ) and rade \u0160erbed\u017eija are somewhat popular , but there are no a-list actors , although i realized that was not the question . 
  speaking of musicians , i remembered 2 cellos , i guess that works for both croatia and slovenia . 
  i do n't think we have an actor or a singer who is particularly recognizable worldwide . 
  if you know anyone , please enlighten me . 
  i was very excited about our eurovision participant last year , she had previously won the voice and she really has a special one . 
  368 in the city of zagreb, 
   croations good think croats are not a part of this . 
  dario \u0160ari\u0107 is quite popular, 
  yes , `` pl . '', 
  before surname , shortened for * plemeniti * = noble . 
  [ elemental - za\u0161to te imam ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnu7ru41jo ) - regularly played at protests [ let 3 - oma\u0111ijaj me ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxsxihincbc ) - parody on former pm, 
  he was a corrupt thief with a corrupt government , they damaged the national companies , accepted bribes , laundered money , probably delayed our eu accession . 
  then he resigned and escaped the country , thankfully he got arrested in austria . 
  yes , it has n't been used for years now . 
  ( besides fries , it was used once to make donuts , but it was a failure ), 
  oh , i have actually heard a little about this for montenegro . 
  how is it possible to trace surnames ' origins that far back ? 
  what is it about ? 
  * sorry for the expression , ... *, 
  i would ' t say it 's only americans who do it and it 's quite annoying to constantly be put in the ee ghetto with all the labels that come with it . 
  zagreb - * metropola * ( metropolis ) - an exaggeration because it 's the biggest one we 've got . 
  opatija - * stara dama * ( old lady ) or * kraljica turizma * ( queen of tourism ) - because it 's where the tourism started dubrovnik - * biser jadrana * ( pearl of the adriatic ) split - * dioklecijanov grad * ( diocletian 's city ) - because it used to be the diocletian 's palace, 
  yes , except for the ones at self-checkout . 
  usually no , but if there 's an exception it would most likely be someone with a [ flag of istria ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/h/hr-pn.gif ) . 
  graz , it used to be very popular to go shopping there , i do n't know if it still is . 
  \u0160koda octavia ( the most common , though it 's said to be replaced with citroen c-elysse ) opel astra caravan smart toyota land cruiser bmw 5-series old mercedes g-class and land rover defender vw transporter mercedes sprinter ... 
  that 's what one tv station had in effect for a week or and got ridiculed by the public for it , years ago . 
  it 's a funny story to tell , but definitely can not be used after so many years to say that croats subtitle serbian movies . 
   but i do not follow nationalistic croato-serbian bullshit . 
  oh , yeah , on the contrary , i 'm a complete total nazi . 
   especially considering that tribe of slavs from lands of poland and east germany moved southwards to illyric land mixed with indigenous people and got ruled by different powers . 
  tribe or tribes ? 
  either way , that 's completely irrelevant . 
  i hope it 's clear to everyone we 're not a slavic tribe anymore and our ethnicity is determined by 1500 years of separate history . 
  you say '' got ruled by different powers '' as if that 's something insignificant , while that 's the most important part . 
  even if we were genetically completely identical , that would n't make us the same people , it 's just completely irrelevant . 
   only difference between croatia , bosnia and serbia are religions which in current world does not play any significant role ( except muslims maybe ) and langauge is you speak is called serbo-croatian ( yugoslavian ) oh , mr.historian ... you should do a revision , perhaps ? 
  maybe start with serbo-croatian and how it became universal in croatia . 
  why ? 
  because you know the history of poland so you would n't say something ridiculous like that . 
  meanwhile , you do n't know our history so you can say whatever you like . 
  just like poles and russians, 
  because we do n't . 
  the only occasion where the majority of people uses the flag is a sports event . 
  at the independence and statehood days some people put the flags on their houses , but not all , usually the more nationalistic ones . 
  at weddings there is usually one flag , or two if the other side of the family is from another country . 
  that line has n't been reached for me yet , so i do n't know . 
  in fact , i would be happy if the ec could dismiss our government if they do n't show the sincere will to carry out needed reforms . 
  confederation as a word would give more weight to it , in my opinion . 
  i could be wrong . 
  it should change the name then !, 
  albanians in macedonia and montenegro could possibly secede . 
  scotland might become independent . 
  i still believe crimea could be returned to ukraine , after years of strong sanctions against russia . 
  the eu will probably become a federation or a confederation , but some of the current members wo n't participate in it . 
  1 - unsatisfactory 2 - satisfactory 3 - good 4 - very good 5 - excellent, 
  [ does he have a heavy accent ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/mos-rvyg9z4?t=18 ) interestingly , i understand quite a lot of what he says , but usually i do n't understand polish at all . 
  i do n't have enough samples from most nations to make a judgement , so it 's the slovenes . 
  edit : oh , oh , forgot about the burgenland croats . 
  yep , that 's the one judging by the photos on google . 
  mine also came with roasted bread . 
  we have a similar soup called * ajnpren juha * but we do n't put cheese in it . 
  i ate some garlic soup with cheese in slovakia , i do n't know what it was . 
  but that was my favourite anyway . 
  it used to be horvat for croat , but we hate vowels . 
  same like trieste which became just trst . 
  [ trash , but infectious ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt_wlyubvlk ) : /, 
  ah , okay , if they can build a colony for the agreed budget , then go ahead . 
  but i still believe there are better and more important space projects than that . 
  they are not mutually exclusive only if the governments have infinite money reserves , therefore if they invest an * astronomical * amount of money into a space colony on the moon , something else will receive less funds . 
  yes , i think space exploration is very interesting and important but we still have a lot of unfinished business on this planet . 
  and where did i say that i am against investing in esa ? 
  i specifically said what i am against . 
  i am against any moon/mars colonies , there are still places on earth without water and electricity access ffs . 
  stray dogs are unommon , but there 's lots of stray cats in coastal towns . 
  there is one wild cat in croatia , the [ lynx ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eurasian_lynx ) . 
  also , there is the [ jackal ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/golden_jackal ) in dalmatia , which i think is some kind of a wild dog . 
  i would learn the basics out of interest , same goes for nz and maori . 
  that said , i would like to learn maori even without moving there . 
  i wish we had been named after our another region called slavonia , that would be so much fun . 
  i have no idea , when i say southerners i mean herzegovinians , they always stick together and always have '' connections '' . 
  meh , we 're not that lucky . 
  we had an bad quality canadian pm import for the poor a year ago , with so many bugs and defects .
