  she would most likely be called a gold digger , but not a mail order bride , that 's reserved exclusively for the slavic-speaking women . 
  i am not picky - merkel , trudeau , macron would all be a refreshment compared to what we have . 
  it depends on the region , the southerners would be in the first , for example , while the northerners would be in the second . 
  germany for the money . 
  rhode island or some other state which has rocky coast . 
  lol not even trying not to be biased . 
  true , split is trash . 
  i agree that the ones you 've listed are also beautiful , i said mine two , the other day i would probably say something else because it 's difficult to decide . 
  st.mark 's church is also quite nice . 
  but i would n't agree that the national theatre in zagreb is a '' stock '' building , even if it is , it does n't make it less beautiful to me than some of the more unique buildings because of that . 
  my favourites are the [ national theatre ] ( http://croatia.hr/images/t900x600-7386/zagreb-hnk.jpg ) and [ art pavilion ] ( https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7082/7161721535_f6d031f7af_b.jpg ) . 
  the ugliest - [ mamutica ] ( http://zkahlina.ca/cro/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mamutica01.jpg ) edit : the city is zagreb, 
  [ neum ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/neum_strip_location_map.svg/500px-neum_strip_location_map.svg.png ) would be convenient so we do n't have to build a bridge . 
  but bridges are fun , so the answer is no . 
  edit : hm , okay , i guess this question can be interpreted in two ways ... 
  our prime minister would refer to every single thing as * one of his priorities * . 
   a good european example is wind turbines . 
  everybody wants clean , renewable energy . 
  nobody wants big , ugly turbines crowding their view . 
  i do n't understand why are they considered ugly . 
  i always thought they were beautiful and cool . 
  speed bumps were put in front of my grandparents ' house . 
  they were annoyed by how loud it was when someone with a trailer passed over them , so they complained to the local authorities until they moved the speed bumps a little further . 
  no , english is fine . 
  you can learn basic phrases but no one expects you to , some of them are difficult to pronounce and everyone knows their english equivalent , anyway . 
  obviously i was n't implying they should vote for jobbik , i had something more left on my mind , not even further right . 
  yes , they can still choose not to again give control of 2/3 of the parliament to one man in the upcoming 2018 election . 
  so the conclusion is : v4 is against redistributing migrants/refugees , which must mean the entire eastern europe is also against it . 
  the montenegrins usually fully embrace those stereotypes with pride !, 
  apart from the stereotypes , not much , i only have basic knowledge about it . 
  their coastal towns are similar to southern dalmatia , but what 's in the inner part of the country , i have no clue . 
  there are serbs . 
  i would n't say most of them have some special feeling for serbia , only in areas which have suffered in war , where people are more nationalistic . 
  50 $ , 10 years ( 5 years for minors ), 
  yes - italian , serbian , czech and hungarian . 
  she is n't fat , but she puts so much make up and fake eyelashes on . 
  oh come on , czech republic can do better than that . 
  australia has a long history with it , they have been broadcasting it for about 40 years , so there is interest in it . 
  i 'm sure if there was the same interest in canada , they would also be allowed to participate . 
  i would love to see new zealand , too . 
  the red and white checkerboard , which probably represented red and white croatia . 
  there is also a legend that one of our kings was captured by the venetians so he had to beat their doge 3 times in chess in order to be released . 
  it 's berlusconi, 
  apparently [ jelena lijepa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helena_of_hungary,_queen_of_croatia ) ( helen the beautiful ) but from those that there are pictures of , [ sissi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empress_elisabeth_of_austria ) ? 
  some say the current president of croatia is attractive but she looks like miss piggy to me . 
  mythological : five brothers and two sisters : hrvat , klukas , kosenjec , muhlo , lobel , buga , tuga ( according to our legend , lech , czech and meh were sons of hrvat , there was also a daughter vilina ) real : [ ante star\u010devi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ante_star%c4%8devi%c4%87 ), 
  the only semi-mythological royalty that i can think of is the black queen , she was a real person , [ barbara of cilli ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barbara_of_cilli ) , but she was evil so there are medieval legends about her being a witch etc. 
  [ legends about her ] ( http://www.secret-zagreb.com/zagrebblog//2011/09/black-queen.html ), 
  [ istro-romanian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istro-romanian_language ) - there 's ~ 1100 people left who speak it [ istriot ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/istriot_language ) - around 900 people left [ dalmatian ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dalmatian_language ) - already extinct since 1898, 
  no , but i do have a lot of respect for tito . 
  obviously . 
   they even pronounced l correctly you mean the l that changes sometimes at the end ? 
  otherwise it 's the same . 
  i understand slovene very well , but i ca n't really speak it . 
  perhaps if i did it would be an offensive mix between croatian and slovene , so i 'd rather not . 
  i ca n't tell which dialects i understand , but i know i do n't understand prekmur\u0161\u010dina ( which is ironic because it 's supposed to be the closest to croatian ) . 
  though when i was in rome 2 years ago , a lot of it came back , even the verb conjugations . 
  croatian  english  german i have learned italian and french each for 4 years but romance languages are very forgettable . 
  there is no official opposition leader , but that title is always given to the leader of the biggest opposition party . 
  currently it 's [ davor bernardi\u0107 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/davor_bernardi%c4%87 ) . 
  the netherlands , although geographically small , is not a small nation . 
  17 million is quite a lot of people . 
  but to answer your question , i think the biggest benefit is that your nationality wo n't ever offend anyone abroad because your country is so insignificant in the world affairs . 
  in case of croatia , a lot of them wo n't even know where your country is . 
  the major con for me is that we will never have impressive , huge buildings for events like , for example , allianz arena in germany . 
  yeah , 60s and 70s were the best years in yugoslavia . 
  after that it started going downhill . 
  i can say about experiences of my older relatives . 
  it was n't that much different from the west in yugoslavia , they knew what was happening outside , western music and culture were not prohibited , life standard was relatively high . 
  of course , when the crisis struck , a lot of things changed , shelves in the supermarkets were empty etc. 
  they went shopping for modern clothes brands to austria and italy . 
  the most annoying thing about it was corruption , if you were highly positioned or had friends who were highly positioned in the communist party , you were often privileged compared to the others in some aspects . 
  i 'm not qualified to evaluate the racism claim , since i 'm not black , even though it 's hard to imagine anyone here would approach you because of your race and randomly start insulting you . 
  curious stares is the most what a black person can usually expect , in touristic areas not even that . 
  but i doubt anyone would risk their life and start beating their child , wife or dog . 
  so you 've experienced racism , domestic violence and animal abuse in the entirety of eastern europe ? 
  sorry , i just do n't buy that shit . 
  there is some exaggeration in the media , but some facts are indesputable . 
  labour camps are very real . 
  severe malnutrition and hunger have been confirmed by the un . 
  look at some of the vlogs of the tourists who went there , even on those planned tours they are n't able to hide the misery of the non-elite majority . 
  take the horrifying stories of those who have escaped in concern . 
  compare it , for example , to yugoslavia , which was also undemocratic , but tourists could freely come without fear of ending up in a labour camp , the citizens were allowed to travel to western countries etc. 
  it 's really ridiculous to compare democracies to totalitarian regimes . 
  here it 's questionable if the law was actually broken because transparency in regimes like that is nonexistent . 
  people can end up in work camps in north korea because their neighbours accuse them of something without any evidence . 
  listen , i just suggested to a person who intends to travel to north korea not to take posters as souvenirs , because as a tourist he might not be aware that in north korea it 's a crime worth 15 years in prison . 
  it 's up to the person to be the judge on whether there is a possibility that an undemocratic regime would make it all up and force the confession out of the victim . 
   i 'm sure you 've had shady convictions in croatia too . 
  no , nothing comparable to this . 
  alcohol and garlic, 
  the key sentence is `` allegedly stole '', 
  if you go , [ do n't steal any posters ] ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/otto_warmbier ) . 
  idiotic , stupid , bimbo ... is there anything else you would like to show off from your amiable vocabulary ? 
  i hear cruel is a horrible word , especially when used as a joke , you might want to write that down . 
  then what was it if it was n't a joke ? 
  an insult ? 
  yeah , that makes so much sense , i am known on this subreddit to go out and spill insults all over the place just out of nowhere . 
  please . 
  if you make everything aggressively that does n't mean everyone else is doing the same .
