  there 's nothing controversial about that joke . 
  you 're just overreacting and you know it . 
  whatever you say ... 
  either way , i 'm pretty sure 99,99 % of slovenes would find it at least borderline funny if they heard pizda is a name in uzbekistan , so maybe it 's just you . 
  no , it 's not , it 's called sarcasm . 
  because you do n't mean it 's really cruel , it 's just a funny word in your language and you joke about it . 
  but you can of course choose an over-aggressive path and call everything idiotic and stupid . 
  because different words have different meanings in different languages , simple as that . 
  tit would n't be exceptionally funny either if you did n't speak english . 
  well , i thought it was quite obvious . 
  in the same way no one in croatia cares that pula means dick in romanian , but on a pan-european subreddit of course this thing will be joked about , even though it 's '' idiotic '' to observe foreign names like that . 
  yeah , and i was being totally serious . 
  i was like half way finished writing a letter to the slovene government complaining about how gaber sounds in croatian so they would ban it asap . 
  fair enough for ru\u017ea , it 's not my favourite sounding name , either . 
  but jasen sounds nice , gaber sounds rough . 
  i mean , it 's a subjective observation , of course . 
  yes , it 's usually male but it can be female . 
  also , it 's an average tree , nothing special about it . 
  it 's like naming someone pumpkin . 
   gaber - hornbeam what a cruel name to give, 
  a lot of plants and fruits , i.e. 
  : female : jagoda - strawberry vi\u0161nja - cherry ljubica - violet dunja - quince ru\u017ea - rose male : jasmin - jasmine ljiljan - lily javor - maple jasen - ash tree, 
  i do n't find the us embassy in zagreb an eye-sore , since it 's on the periphery of the city , near the airport . 
  the only thing about its size and isolation from other embassies is that it contributes to the conspiracy theory that croatia is in fact led from * buzin * ( neighborhood where it 's located ) . 
  a year ago or so , it was around 4 on richter scale . 
  it was quite short , felt like something very heavy fell inside the house . 
  they are one sound . 
  in cyrillic they are n't digraphs . 
  they are in croatian, 
  \u0161 \u017e \u0107 \u010d \u0111 d\u017e nj lj but we do n't have x , y , q and w, 
   russia could do the same , i suppose , but it can not enter the market . 
  which you should blame your leaders for , not the eu . 
  take canada as an example that it 's possible . 
  it was for a guinness world record ( since the tie is like our trademark ), 
  [ amphitheatre in pula ] ( http://www.bozoskoko.com/upload/images/modules/news/original/267-kako-su-hrvati-uljudili-europu-360-godina-od-ulaska-kravate-u-svijet-mode.jpg ) - 27bc - 68 ad there are buildings older than that , but this one is probably the most famous oldest building . 
  bliski istok - near east edit : there are also alternatives : * prednji * ( front ) and * srednji * ( middle ) , but they are n't really used . 
  well , that 's not the end of the world , if macron gets 3 million more votes like hillary did , he will be president in that case . 
  i learned from it that some of my fellow countrymen eat dormice and stone soup . 
  overweight people are not a rare sight at all , but morbidly obese people are very rare . 
  fat shaming is not a thing , although it 's not uncommon that a close friend or a family member warns you if you start gaining weight . 
  the last time we were a part of an absolute monarchy was from 1929 to 1934 , the reign of alexander i of yugoslavia . 
  the croats assassinated that king , so that 's how he was viewed . 
  that entire dynasty in general is negatively perceived in croatia . 
  for the majority of its existence , already from 1948 , yugoslavia was non-aligned , so i would n't say so . 
  the only reason it 's put in the eastern bloc is because it was socialist . 
  nah we have liberland, 
  inb4 it starts , slovakia and czechia/poland and hungary , get a room . 
  i agree with opatija and zagreb , but dubrovnik is overly known - they have introduced people counters , so when the number reaches 8000 in the old city , it wo n't be possible to enter inside the walls before some of those leave . 
  ( this is a rule for organized groups , not individuals ), 
  the largest number emigrated in the second half of the 19th century , due to the fact that austrians and hungarians were completely untalented to lead a monarchy , which led to a horrible position of croats , a lot of them lost their property because of debt and had nowhere to work , the sickness of grapevine was also an important factor on the coast . 
  most of them moved to the rust belt states and california . 
  why is toyota land cruiser so popular in russia ? 
  have a blue eu passport, 
  i can definitely relate to this as well, 
  our cinematography is obsessed with ww2 and 1990s , whether it 's a drama , a comedy , a thriller ... 
  it 's nothing special , i like the [ exterior design ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/fe/b6/feb6d7a8fcbdbb8952ce97c123c15955.jpg ) of the planes but the [ interior ] ( http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ukidrnwdax0/uasatf8qx2i/aaaaaaaaeb0/urm4imkqcfa/s1600/croatiaairlinescrew.jpg ) is boring . 
  the fleet is only short and medium-range planes and they are focused only on european routes . 
  they are currently on sale if anyone 's interested ... 
   what kind of bread ? 
  sweet bread called [ pinca ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pinca ) and [ braided easter bread ] ( http://domacirecepti.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/uskrsnja-trpeza.jpg ) are traditional , but any type is fine . 
   would you say that easter is fairly important and celebrated in croatia ? 
   sidenote : is it fair to say croatia identifies strongly with catholicism ? 
  yes and yes , although i 'm probably not the right person to answer since i 'm not very religious , easter is just a tradition for me . 
  i do n't really have an opinion , the tourists are fine , i did n't notice they are more rude than the others . 
  i usually imagine them like [ this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/28/03/18/28031866a495c62b7fbeb0af51354657.jpg ) . 
  homemade bread , ham , radish , green onion , horseradish , cottage cheese and/or french ( russian ) salad . 
  that 's a typical easter breakfast here . 
  mostly eat, 
  i only notice them when they test their planes above zagreb , which is so stupid because zagreb is in a seismically active area , so it always scares the shit out of everyone because everyone thinks it 's an earthquake . 
  it sounds more like an eastern slavic language than a southern one . 
  i did n't understand a lot from the talk show , but i did notice the lack of cases , which causes a bit of an eye twitch . 
  always works . 
   it never happened to me , that a charity organization would send you gifts . 
  is this really a thing ? 
  it happened to me , there is an organization called '' artists who draw with mouths and legs '' , they send original christmas cards by mail and you send them the money later . 
  though , technically , you could just take the cards without sending them anything in return . 
  yes , it is , istria is bilingual . 
  the citizens are allowed to use either croatian or italian for official purposes . 
  istria is very italian , i would say . 
  they are all equally shit, 
  i agree with you that ljudevit gaj chose the language from famous dubrovnik 's writers works as a standard . 
  but , no , it was n't chosen because both serbs and croats claimed dubrovnik , no one was claiming anything in the 19th century . 
  they chose the same language because they were more powerful together against the austrians and hungarians , not because they could n't agree on who dubrovnik belongs to . 
  no , it was n't . 
  this was in the 19th century , when we were in a-h . that dialect was chosen so that our languages would be as close as possible . 
  serbs and croats were allies back then . 
   and all these languages ( or dialects of serbo-croatian for some people ) have it as a basis because both croats and serbs claimed dubrovnik that is definitely not why we have it as a basis . 
  ever heard of ljudevit gaj ? 
  everyone knows the 1990s were 10 years ago . 
  but can i tell you your ambassador here in croatia is awesome ? 
  she represents you very well . 
  in that direction is russia , right ? 
  either poland and hungary or czechia and slovakia, 
  [ fritule ] ( http://camesawloved.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/20151217_211023.jpg ) in dalmatia or just ice cream or fresh juice . 
  other than that , street food is not very popular . 
  they originate from 1848 , a few months after the revolutions in the austrian empire started , when they were protecting our * ban * ( leader ) in their town . 
  i ca n't find the exact information about why they were women , but apparently they felt he was in danger so they decided to protect him . 
   dej jim to like in one of our dialects . 
  yes , in zagreb they are the [ cravat regiment ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/kravat_pukovnija_trg_sv_marka_2_18102012_roberta_f.jpg ) in front of the government and parliament , and the [ presidential guard ] ( https://fenix-magazin.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/predsjednica-_pocasna-straza.jpg ) . 
  the only female guard we have is [ this one ] ( http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fsfomdesf-8/velwqnncmki/aaaaaaaadyc/nbyuxxuotfg/s1600/image0076.jpg ) from a place called kri\u017eevci .
