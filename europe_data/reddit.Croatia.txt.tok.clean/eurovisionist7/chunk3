  not that everyone does it on purpose , a lot of them do it subconsciously . 
  bitch please , i 've also watched all of the muhte\u015fem y\u00fczy\u0131l : k\u00f6sem episodes that have come out . 
  i do n't know what they 're talking about since i do n't speak turkish , but i know what 's up . 
  i 'm mostly in for the angry stares and dramatic music during the stares . 
  when a country has either ` independent ' or ` democratic ' in it 's name , you can be 100 % sure it 's true . 
  i 'm not . 
  but you have to put things in a perspective of time . 
  tito was the best we had in 1945 , we were n't in a position to be picky . 
  and he 's not even that important , it 's the people who fought against fascism . 
  that 's who the croats were , and they won . 
  they returned the lost croatian territories that had been sold by the chetnik collaborators , ustashe . 
  ustashe are not even croats to me , it 's their choice since they are ashamed of their ancestry and they believe they 're germans . 
  my grandma would be in italy today if there was no tito and anti-fascists . 
   your father escaped exactly . 
  the father escaped and now his son is telling me to go lick boots in belgrade . 
  shameless, 
  okay , he chose his son over his country . 
  which is a fair choice , but you should know that our fathers had children , too . 
  who would have fought in the war if all of them left ? 
  well why did n't he fight the serbs ? 
  it 's easy to act smart about a country and war you know nothing about . 
  typical for australian emigration . 
  they are known for being the biggest embarrassment of croatia . 
  i was talking about australia , not yugoslavia . 
  why did n't your father fight them ? 
  instead he raised a child in a rich country , because it 's easier . 
  now that child teaches us what the war is . 
  still one of the most beautiful and recognizable squares in croatia holds his name . 
  marshal tito square , right where the national theatre is . 
  anti-fascism is very alive . 
  ante paveli\u0107 can be suggested as a name for our sewerage system , he deserves something big , after all . 
  you 're a disgrace for croatia for praising one of the biggest embarrassments in croatian history . 
  please change your flag , that flag is not your flag . 
  why did your ancestors leave croatia like all the nazi cowards ? 
  why did n't they fight the communism ? 
  is communism forbidden ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  do n't you have kosovo/albania to play with ? 
  we 're still recovering !!, 
  similar here in croatia . 
  it annoys me so much , it creates a contrary effect and we appear like nothing else than miserable wannabe westerners . 
  as if i should be ashamed because i 'm from eastern europe because the west looks down on us . 
  bitch please , i 've already watched all of the muhte\u015fem y\u00fczy\u0131l . 
  h\u00fcrrem ruled the empire , not suleyman . 
  ** slovenia ** : favourite skiing destination , i cheer for their ski jumpers and tina maze . 
  other sports too , when croatia is not competing . 
  our most populous tourists in summer ** hungary ** : thanks for giving us the best christmas pastry ever , ` ma\u0111arica ' , even though i do n't know if it 's actually yours ** serbia ** : what would a croat be without a serb and vice versa ? 
  despite the moronic politicians , we proved that the war is far behind us and that we 're together when it 's the most needed ** montenegro ** : you can not not love the lazy , funny speaking people of mne . 
  the country is amazingly beautiful ** bosnia and herzegovina ** : wonderful people born with the sense of humor , something croats will never have . 
  the food is amazing , if you have n't tried burek , baklava , halva , \u0107evapi ... , you have n't lived, 
  you are talking about partnership for peace . 
  even russia is a member of partnership for peace . 
  who is the dancing guy in white at the part when he says : ` we have professionals that will make your ears bleed ' ? 
  i want to hear the song lol, 
  that 's more than 20 % of the countries, 
  the prime minister , who is now in prison btw , submitted the application , bush arrived in a ceremonial visit and we were in nato . 
  no one asked us ( citizens ) for our opinion . 
  pilf *, 
  the poll is misleading . 
  it appears that the majority of citizens do n't want serbia in the eu , but actually it 's nato they do n't want . 
  even if you asked croatian citizens what they think of nato , i assure you that at least 50 % would answer negatively about it . 
  that 's why we did n't have a referendum on joining it , after all . 
  the poll is made as if nato and eu are the same thing . 
  there are many countries in the eu which are not members of nato . 
  i wish we left nato since no one asked us at the first place if we wanted to join . 
  i have n't had it for few years now so maybe i 'm a bit nostalgic . 
  my parents often went on business trips to czech republic when i was a kid and they always brought back studentska, 
  the wrappers were also much better [ before ] ( http://www.ekapija.com/dokumenti/zivotinjskocarstvo_120308.jpg ) , imo . 
  the new ones look like they 're some generic supermarket brand . . 
  they 're not a chocolate bar , but they probably count as chocolate, 
  i was worried it was only a limited version for christmas . 
  i was relieved when i found out it 's going to be available forever . 
  that does cover a variety of my needs !, 
  call kolinda if you need someone [ to set your tiles ] ( http://www.starmo.ba/media/k2/items/cache/ef1975cfea53a3610b959d613726cbba_xl.jpg ) and [ paint your walls ] ( https://www.bhdani.ba/media/articles/37b5d-kolinda-kreci-01.jpg ) or if you want some [ ' \u010dvarci ' ] ( http://cdn-static.rtl-hrvatska.hr/repository/images/8/5/85ce64a23d4401db28b9143ba86fd4f3.jpg?v=20 ), 
  absolutely . 
  i think she is even more versatile and multitalented , though . 
  there is even a saying ` kolindiranje ' , after her first name , kolinda . 
  it means taking selfies and pretending to do something but actually doing nothing in reality . 
  that 's really impressive !, 
  they even fly further than our sophisticated 1959 mig 21s !, 
  really ?!, 
  meanwhile , i 'm so annoyed because i can buy it only when i 'm in czech r. or slovakia , since we do n't have it here !, 
  our president is perfectly qualified for the fifth one . 
  she has already driven a [ combine ] ( http://seebiz.eu:8080/upload/seebiz_eu/upload/sc_autogenerated_part_3/article/ar_115166/kolindakombajn_0_0_468x10000.jpg ) , a [ tractor ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/0d/22/0d224e8eec5116f9a1d134d08d563aa9.jpg ) , a [ ferry ] ( http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/archive/images/2015/08/11/sd_specijal/kolinda_brac5-100815.jpg ) and she has also flown a [ helicopter ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/31/ee/31ee1101dcf3f80b6f6dc8a6e0fb1470.jpg ) simulator . 
  i do n't think she 'll have much problems with a plane . 
  she also knows how to [ shoot ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/pxl_140315_10213023_kolindagrabarkitarovic.jpg ) , which is also a plus . 
  we 're just that one plane away from becoming a global military superpower !, 
  my favourite croatian chocolate is [ bajadera kra\u0161 ] ( http://croatiareviews.com/media/reviews/photos/original/b3/11/90/587-bajadera-kras-71-1438531083.jpg ) outside of croatia , my favourite is probably czech [ studentska ] ( https://www.orioncokolada.cz/image.php?id=433&amp;width=500 ), 
  also , our planes will double the strength . 
  [ an asian pacific version of eurovision will be held for the first time in 2017 in australia ] ( http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=eurovision_song_contest_concept_to_be_developed_in_asia ), 
  maybe you 're right . 
  we should give them our glorious , magnificent pula , it will most certainly please them . 
  yeah , we ca n't give them dubrovnik but we can offer them the uninhabitated island of babina guzica ( granny 's ass ) . 
  they ca n't have pula , either . 
  in croatia : ** 1 . horvat ** : means croat ** 2 . novak ** : newcommer ** 3 . mari\u0107 ** : comes from the female given name mara/marija ** 4 . kova\u010devi\u0107 ** : comes from a word '' kova\u010d '' = '' smith '' , which is also a common surname . 
  ** 5 . babi\u0107 ** : comes from a word '' baba '' , which means grandma/old lady, 
  it was supposed to join by mid-2016 . 
  but i do n't think that 's likely because of the migrant crisis . 
   serbs already have an access to work in germany and austria as much as eu citizens have no  studying is even completely free for serb students in austria which is far better deal than even the eu countries have eu citizens study for free in austria + in most of the other eu countries , or for the fees that students who are native to that country have to pay, 
  dustin , is that you ?
