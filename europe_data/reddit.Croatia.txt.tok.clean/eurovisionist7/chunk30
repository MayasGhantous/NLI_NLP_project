  zagreb : historical and political : [ upper town - st. mark 's square ] ( https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5563/15084477028_88117443d2_b.jpg ) official : [ lower town - ban jela\u010di\u0107 's square ] ( http://antun.com/gallery3/var/albums/holidays/album/p1020018.jpg?m=1355361590 ) as for the traffic , i guess the ljubljana/zagreb/slavonia avenues , they go throughout the city . 
  ca n't decide between these two : * je\u017eeva ku\u0107ica * ( [ hedgehog 's home ] ( http://hedgehog.honey-tongued.co.uk/the-story/ ) ) * ivica i marica * ( [ hansel and gretel ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hansel_and_gretel ) ), 
  [ presidential election 2015-14 ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_presidential_election,_2014%e2%80%9315 ) , the incumbent president failed to win a second term and was defeated by only 32.509 votes . 
  he was a favourite in polls and it was quite a shock when he lost . 
  he later blamed the leader of sdp , then the prime minister , for his defeat ( he was an unpopular prime minister ) . 
  he then created his own party which failed to win any seats in the parliament , it will be remembered mostly for this tragic [ campaign ad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k5b_ax2bdq ) and the parodies of it : [ allahu akbar ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8-gjjrq2bk ) , [ hail satan ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gfnjulmok8 ) , [ metal ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc5fyrvlgdu ) , [ long live greater serbia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xejqbcuo8s ),

  no , with all the respect , i do n't think they can take care of themselves with that lifestyle , let alone run a country . 
  well , brazil , then . 
  but some region with low crime rate . 
  okay , i 'm deleting my answer . 
  it looks embarrassing in comparison xd, 
  our recipe is also different . 
  apparently the original one has meat in it , ours does n't . 
  what we call a french salad in croatia is actually [ from russia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/olivier_salad ), 
  zagreb was first mentioned in 1094 when a diocese was founded . 
  it got the status of a '' free royal city '' in 1242 . 
  * googles ljubljana 's mayor * * reads his role model is zagreb 's mayor milan bandi\u0107 * well , that explains it . 
  save yourselves . 
  well , everyone was '' refugees welcome '' until it became obvious that no one wants to stay here . 
  i remember even reading articles about how they could populate the areas that are dying out and save us from a demographic disaster xd, 
  he 's corrupt to the bone and since recently he has this fetish of building expensive fountains in stupid locations . 
  we have local elections in a couple of months and i have n't decided yet who i am going to vote for in the first round , but i know i will be voting against the current mayor of zagreb in the second round . 
  yes , the bomb went off and there were lots of injured people . 
  here 's a wikipedia article about it : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_rijeka_bombing, 
  there was only one in rijeka in 1995 . 
  a terrorist tried to destroy a police station by driving a car with a bomb into the wall . 
  he was the only dead . 
  horror . 
  kind of , it 's supposed to represent [ this building ] ( http://lidija-photo.com/portfolio/fotografije-grada-splita/split-sv-duje/split-zvonik-katedrala-sv-duje-027.jpg ) . 
  i think he was referring to the dangers that come at the fool who wants to learn it . 
  i tried it on duolingo and almost choked .

  well after googling * mistral * , i found out it 's a wind in provence , france , so i do n't know , could be . 
  we have * maestral * and it 's usually followed by good weather . 
  maestral is a friendly , gentle wind , which helps you on the beach in the summer . 
  other than that , yes . 
  also draft . 
  interesting , i 've never heard about that . 
  i think culturally people are not afraid of the sun here , it 's the wind that scares us . 
  never heard of that, 
  i 'm confused , is frisbee how they call a boomerang in england ? 
  kosovo is croatia, 
  i like our current weird shape , but if there is a better shape to be created by merging with someone , i 'm open to it . 
  rijeka and istria are waaaay more liberal . 
  you underestimate the number of herzegovinians in zagreb . 
  i do n't support it , there are no benefits whatsoever which would justify it . 
  if someone is to be circumcised , it should be their own decision .

  hungary is a good rival for you in football :d, 
  a populist politician 's ama . 
  he was annoyed that he could n't delete the questions so he called the reddit platform '' bullshit '' and cancelled the ama . 
  for the tram , [ this is the best photo i could find ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/53/5d/535d8b86403279e56c5b7bd818518c74.jpg ) . 
  it 's the driver in the middle and then like a tinted glass wall behind him . 
  i have never seen a different concept in a tram than this , what are they like in slovenia ? 
  reason ? 
  probably so that an unstable passenger can not potentially hijack the controls . 
  to whom ? 
  the drivers are in their closed cabin , they would n't hear it . 
  they were monarchs from 9 different ruling houses throughout history . 
  ( 10 if you count habsburg-lorraine as a new dynasty , 11 if you count the kings of yugoslavia and 12 if you count the illegitimate king of nazi croatia . ), 
  nope , at least not that i know of . 
  there are societies who work on the standardization of kajkavian , so that it can become an independent active language which could be used officially in the regions where it 's native . 
  that would be a huge achievement , but changing the standard language in the whole country is unnecessary and unrealistic , since people outside of the kajkavian regions would n't be interested in learning a new dialect/language . 
  there were . 
  it was originally supposed to be like that , but ljudevit gaj finally agreed to the shtokavian because it was closer to what most other south slavs spoke . 
  it was the time of the illyrian movement so it was important for them to all have one common language . 
  kajkavian is completely different in almost everything with standard croatian , to put it simply . 
  [ here 's the differences listed ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kajkavian#characteristics ) .
