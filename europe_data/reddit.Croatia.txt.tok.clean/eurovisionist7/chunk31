  stri\u010dek - uncle ( on father 's side ) diminutive teta - aunt or just * gospodin * ( mister ) and * gospo\u0111a * ( lady ), 
  [ croatian-serbian guilty pleasure ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvchbkh4jqy ) - this is the original , even though there are [ greek ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezdxvht4ll8 ) and [ brazilian ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxnremymufk ) versions, 
  is n't pvv the strongest party in the netherlands right now , polling at ~ 30 % ? 
  parties like that get ~ 1.5 % here , not even close to the 5 % threshold to enter the parliament ... 
  basements of the diocletian 's palace ( split ) , i guess . 
  i 've never even heard of any of those before lol , only * stojadin * and i 've heard * folcika * in a bosnian tv show ( izet fazlinovi\u0107 ), 
  since that 's an actual word in slovene , i guess that 's why we call it like that . 
  but i guess it changed the meaning , as it sounds like a diminutive of duck , so it is believed to be named after the ugly duckling . 
  edit : it is * mer\u0111o * in zagreb , it could be * me\u010dka * in other parts of croatia , not sure . 
  it 's what a bosnian would say , i think . 
  mercedes-benz : * mer\u0111o * bmw : * bemba\u010d * audi : not a slang , but i 've seen many articles referring to it as * gospodar prstenova * ( lord of the rings ) some specific for a model : vw beetle : * buba * fiat 500 : * fi\u010dek * polski fiat : * peglica * yugo : * jugi\u0107 * citroen ds : * \u017daba * ( frog ) citroen 2cv : * spa\u010dek * ( duck ) mercedes w110 : * repa\u0161 * ( means it had nice '' tails '' in the back ), 
  consonants make so much more sense than vowels , they are easier to remember . 
   reminds me a bit of udrea reminds me of coco t. . . because that is coco t on the photo !, 
  sad . 
  bosnian burek is different, 
  well if you go to sarajevo ( if you already have n't been ) , you should try , it 's very delicious . 
  i thought the same as you before i visited sarajevo , probably because i had never tried any dough with meat so it seemed weird . 
  a pastry from bosnia , looks like [ this ] ( http://www.mlinar.hr/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/mlinar-proizvodi-burek-meso-600x380.png ) or [ this ] ( http://i0.wp.com/foodperestroika.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dukagjiniburekgroundmeat-small.jpg?resize=800%2c516 ), 
  why ? 
  in bosnia there is no * burek with * , there is just * burek * and it 's filled with meat . 
  what you mentioned they call * sirnica * . 
  it 's different in serbia and croatia because we are heretics and have '' burek '' with anything . 
  i can say for bosnia , they will 100 % kill you if you order burek with cheese . 
  [ ultra europe ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultra_europe ) and [ inmusic ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inmusic_festival ), 
  on islands and in northern adriatic there are places where they use cakavizam . 
  so they basically pronounce both ** \u010d ** and ** \u0107 ** as just ** c ** , which makes it sound like a language we speak to cute dogs and kids . 
  [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi4dqxnuwhw ), 
  * hrvoje * is a derivative of * hrvat * , which is how we say for a croat today . 
  * horvat * is how we used to say for a croat before we got rid of that useless vowel between h and r. so , yes , technically his name is croat croat . 
  * horvat * can also be a first name , so it 's not impossibe that there is a horvat horvat somewhere . 
  he 's not that rare to meet , * hrvoje * horvat would be his name . 
  ivan horvat ( john croat ) and marija horvat ( mary croat ), 
  not sure , bec , budapest and belgrade did n't work for us . 
  maybe bruxelles would be better . 
  we 've just joined, 
  mining in croatia does n't exist , unless you also count oil and gas exploitation . 
  people in this business probably vote for all kinds of parties , depends on their political preferences . 
  yes , they do . 
  but you can say whatever you want , so we have lots of extraterrestrials , jedi warriors and yodas . 
  english is one of the official languages of the eu and it will stay official after brexit , because of ireland and malta . 
  but what kind of an important significance does istria have to your country 's history ? 
  it is now one of the most developed regions of croatia , but it was always underdeveloped and very poor throughout its history . 
  also , not sure what kind of history you are talking about , those areas under venice or occupied by the fascists in ww2 ? 
  yes , the biggest one is in rijeka . 
  they dress up as whatever is relevant now , animals , politicians ... 
  it also ca n't go without the traditional pagan leftovers [ zvon\u010dari ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zvon%c4%8dari ) . 
  [ here 's what it looks like ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmdo_o0ghi ) . 
  edit : i forgot to mention that it also ca n't go without donuts . 
  he was thinking about s&m, 
  you logged into your alter-ego account to act as your own spokesperson ? 
  sad . 
  there 's too many to list them all , so here 's a few : - [ taj\u010di - hajde da ludujemo ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ln_t7u64q8 ) - [ daleka obala - morska vila ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uaj0yzufmq ) - [ s.a.r.s. 
  - perspektiva ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fog7mj1_-sk ), 
  he 's never been there . 
  it 's just now popular on the subs he visits to talk how france and sweden are islamized . 
  i do n't know how it even starts in croatian , even though there is a croatian version , but it does n't sound natural . 
  even when we entered the eu it was sang in german at the celebration . 
  it was a joke because luka is half-croatian and half-slovenian . 
  excuse me ? 
  i do also know the croatian anthem , yes . 
  1/4 :p ( i know , i do n't mind if we share them ), 
  yes , he is . 
  apparently the japanese are particularly crazy about him . 
  it 's similar with einstein , a jew from germany who later became an american . 
  nikola tesla and josip broz tito ... from those who are alive , probably the guys from 2cellos or some football or nba player . 
  yes , that is not turbo folk . 
  turbo folk is a genre based on serbian folk music . 
  i was thinking of singers like ines erbus . 
  he said pop-folk a.k.a. 
  the turbo folk . 
  that 's ceca , lepa brena , sandra afrika ... that 's not the same as the actual folk . 
  that is a subject in the last year of secondary school here . 
  people are still very irresponsible when it comes to informing themselves about the party they are voting for . 
  the first thing that popped in my head was [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj920cn2hma ) . 
  i 'm not sure what he would be doing here in the first place , but i doubt there would be any protests . 
  there were n't any even when erdogan was here . 
  what do you have against [ the amazing old design ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/skoda_favorit-s%c5%82.jpg ) ? 
  you should 've put a photo of the new [ kodiaq ] ( http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/24/750x445/759246.jpg ) , it looks amazing . 
  [ ukraine ] ( http://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/traditional-ukrainian-crowns-treti-pivni-46-57985c2807a04__605.jpg ) with their flower crowns . 
  if you liked bonbon , you might like [ gery nikol ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrglnyc-agm ), 
  someone has to be from the two of us . 
  hungarian : varos slovenian : upam , da ni res italian : come ti chiami ? 
  german : '' * wo * bist du ? 
  french : elle conduit une voiture swedish : j\u00e4vla irish : eire turkish : bok polish : kurwa czech and slovak : ahoj !, 
  russian : zdravstvujte !, 
  spanish : puta portuguese : boa tarde dutch : ik, 
  i thought you were religious, 
  vagina , penis , god, 
  but how can one be so stupid to miss the deadline 83 times ? 
  that person is either very , very dumb or is being bribed . 
  the penalties we 're going to pay now are going to be huge , i do n't believe someone accidentally forgot about it . . 
   our politicians literally forgot to fill the paperwork on time , even after eu sent a notice to remind them to do it i simply do n't believe that . 
  i remember when the former minister of environment mirela holy [ said that there is a mafia controlling the waste management ] ( http://www.novilist.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/zasto-je-mirela-holy-morala-otici-smece-uzvraca-udarac ) , she claimed that she was receiving death threats when she started with the reforms . 
  then she left office after 6 months because of a minor mistake . 
  i guess [ nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 zrinski : u boj , u boj ! ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu9yeadvccm ) . 
  either that or [ ero s onoga svijeta ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eihlvrlraac ) . 
  i present to you [ the new flag of croatia ] ( http://i.imgur.com/mnfllzy.png ) , i hope you do n't mind . . 
   their flag is a copycat of the dutch excuse me , but not everyone has the ability to come up with a triangle !, 
  [ our president is too annoying for juncker ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppfthef9m_k ), 
  nevermind , i thought your comment was a joke since i thought of januar and februar and figured all your months must end with an '' r '' , but i realized they do n't once i started reciting them in my head : s,
