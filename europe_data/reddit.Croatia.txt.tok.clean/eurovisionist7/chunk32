  so in croatia it 's just travanj , srpanj , rujan and prosinac ? 
  great , now it 's sije\u010danj so i can sit on a cold floor . 
  leave your back uncovered at night and you 'll get a kidney infection xd, 
  that 's hilarious , although it 's quite similar here . 
  if you go out in the wind with your hair wet , you will get meningitis and die . 
  does n't matter if it 's 30 \u00b0 c. 
  i thought it was only us who had these unjustified fears of wind , a/c , ventilators , sitting on the cold floor , wet hair , walking barefoot ... 
  but it looks like it 's the same in many other countries . 
  the dalmatian , although they are quite wild apparently - so just like the human dalmatians :p, 
  if the polls are so inaccurate that she will compensate for such a huge margin that she has against all of her possible opponents in the second round , then she 's maybe not leading at all in the first round . 
  in other words , neither brexit nor trump were lagging behind as much as le pen is in the second round , they were both extremely close with the other option in polls . 
   maybe `` einbrenn '' ? 
  that 's how we call it - * ajnpren * , so probably . 
  yes , people call it like that here also . 
  cumin here as well , also paprika . 
  to me it always looked disgusting , i used to eat it only without eggs . 
  and then i tried it with eggs and it 's a hundred times better . 
  it 's a simple soup made from garlic , flour and eggs . 
  we call that * hladetina * , i would never try it, 
  almost non-existent . 
  we have bosnians and serbians who do it for us . 
  we have one good comedian ( for our standards ) and he has to use a bosnian accent to sound funny . 
  according to streetview , it was already used on government buildings in 2011 . 
  not sure if you count only fabric flags , but most europeans see the eu flag on car plates every day . 
  plus the other two '' dialects '' that they teach us are considered to be dialects of croatian only by our linguists , while all other linguists insist they are separate languages ( kajkavian and chakavian ), 
  [ there 's one at the main square here in zagreb ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/@45.8130629,15.9780523,3a,75y,353.14h,99.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s6sk7qvlrtnwtv0dfggmn3a!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1 ) . 
  that 's the most '' unofficial '' one that i can think of . 
  yes , winnetou was popular here , too . 
  they were shooting a new one last year , from what i 've heard . 
  not a film , but game of thrones . 
  also , the scenes for '' star wars episode 9 '' were filmed in dubrovnik and '' robin hood : origins '' is currently being filmed there , so we 're yet to see if they 'll have the same impact as game of thrones . 
   renault 4 got ta love pahor, 
  the coverage in the media is relatively okay , the meps are often in the media , but it could be much better . 
  2/11 of our meps left the eu parliament a few months ago , one is now pm and the other is fm , so the new ones replaced them and i do n't even know what they look like . 
  some issues get a lot of coverage , some do n't . 
  for example , an action which got a lot of coverage was when one of our meps announced a thorough research on the difference in quality of products in the eastern eu countries compared to the western ones . 
  the lists of properties owned by all political figures have to be available to the public . 
  so according to their property cards : president : $ 620.000 , [ her apartment building ] ( http://www.vecernji.hr/media/cache/41/09/4109b0083b62b4c64bd487a61a54e694.jpg ) pm : $ 490.000 , [ his apartment building ] ( http://m.tportal.hr/resourcemanager/getimage.aspx?imgid=931537&amp;shotid=1&amp;width=630&amp;height=360 ) former presidents , pms , opposition leaders do n't differ much and most are in this middle/upper middle class range . 
   `` pula '' is a vulgar word for `` penis '' here . 
  means `` dick '' basically . 
  i know haha , your tourists always take pictures in front of the road sign to show where they were , 
  i am not a huge fan of our coat of arms with the crown , so i would probably just return it to [ the version without it ] ( http://zeljko-heimer-fame.from.hr/images/hr-1939.gif ) . 
  that 's a conservative change that probably would n't anger a lot of people , but if i could change it to anything , i would choose a flag of one of our regions , i.e. 
  [ slavonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_slavonia ) , [ dalmatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_dalmatia ) , [ istria ] ( http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/h/hr-pn.gif ) . 
  the [ flag of the city of pula ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/zastava_pule.svg ) would also be cool , so croatia could into nordic . 
  i wonder what it would be like if merkel praised california 's secessionist movement . 
  [ how yes no !, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/dnqh-c8b53c?t=1218 ), 
  i am more concerned about his most recent comments on the eu :  quoted in german by bild from a conversation held in english , trump predicted that britain 's exit from the eu will be a success and portrayed the eu as an instrument of german domination designed with the purpose of beating the u.s. in international trade . 
  for that reason , trump said , he 's fairly indifferent to whether the eu stays together , according to bild . 
   `` if you ask me , more countries will leave , '' he said . 
  he just needs to die . 
  you can encounter inches ( zoll ) when buying electronics with screens ( computer , tablet , tv ... ) or car rims . 
  there are a few of our own '' imperial '' measurements still in use that you do n't have , but they are very rare . 
  they are the remains of [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/austrian_units_of_measurement ) . 
  * kako da ne !, 
  * - how yes no !, 
  = yeah right !, 
  * - who is cutting your hair !, 
  = who cares about you !, 
  * - you can take a photo of yourself . 
  = it 's all lost now . 
  * - my dick hurts . 
  = i do n't care . 
  * - you will see your god . 
  = you will get a revenge . 
   but im sure noone thought croatia would be at the turn of the millenium actually , our tourist visits reached the pre-war numbers only a few years ago . 
  we were always a popular destination , it 's just that we have recovered now . 
  btw , we have a very long if not the longest tradition of nudist holidays thanks to your king edward viii who wanted to swim naked with his wife and when the authorities allowed it , it became a trend . 
  i know , you traveled to a parallel universe where you were called / u/kontaktnicenter, 
  why do n't you post on / r/europe anymore ? 
  we miss your 300 uploads in 30 seconds there, 
  candle , stop it, 
  / u/kontaktnicenter pls, 
  that sentiment is usually very prevalent among our diaspora because their ancestors had to run away after the ww2 ( argentina , australia , canada ) and the ones who used to be a part of croatia back then ( bosnian croats ) . 
  the next group are the poorly educated ones from rural areas , particularly scarred in the 1990s war , who equalize the efforts for an independent croatia with the ww2 '' independent state of croatia '' , while they do n't understand that it was as independent as the '' democratic people 's republic of korea '' is democratic . 
  some of them from dalmatia do n't even understand that today they would be in italy , not croatia . 
  unlike in english , in croatian ( and some other languages ) there are formal and informal versions of '' you '' . 
  so it 's rude to use the informal version when speaking with strangers , older people , professors ... 
  [ easy cheesse ] ( https://sparkroom.com/wp-content/uploads/kraft-easy-cheese.jpg ) but pretty much anything when it comes to food . 
  i was once watching a video of an american making a cake and she bought all the parts and just put them together , did n't do much of a cooking . 
  well , who would n't want to join ireland today ? 
  can we ? 
  when they leave , you 'll probably also be obliged to protect the external eu border . 
  do you now have border control on r. of ireland-ni border ? 
  no , that 's probably because you 're an island and you 're not surrounded by the so-called 3rd countries . 
  countries on the continent are obliged to join schengen . 
  yes , i do n't see what 's there to lose . 
  what i 'm strongly against and it has been in the media , is the 2-speed eu reorganization model . 
  a horrible idea which would ghettoize us poorer countries even further . 
  davor - croatian/slavic god of war, 
   but most people enjoying spending the evening partying on the boat eh , i watched a documentary about [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ms_estonia ) and i would probably need an advil to enjoy it, 
  how long does a ferry ride to stockholm last ? 
  it does n't look very close , and i know it takes ages from croatia to italy with a ferry . 
  is it a ferry with cars or something more like a speedboat ? 
  no , as long as they do n't get angry at me for thinking i 'm russian . 
  i do n't mind people saying '' spasiba '' to me . 
  due to the incredibly ** dangerous ** situation , the specified countries now only offer guided armed vehicle sightseeing , so you have nothing to be paranoid about . 
  only for you , you need some ,
