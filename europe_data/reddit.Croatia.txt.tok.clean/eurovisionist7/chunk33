  klek - he was a giant who was flirting with perun 's ( slavic god ) wife . 
  when perun found out , he started chasing him and after a while klek became exhausted and had to stop . 
  perun shot him with an arrow and klek petrified ( literally ) from fear . 
  today , he is [ this mountain ] ( http://www.ldklek-ogulin.hr/slike/klek.jpg ) and there is a stream which appeared from his blood . 
  every night , fairies and witches on their brooms gather up there in desire to wake him up . 
  inside klek mountain , there is a pile of ducats and a snake lying on the top of it . 
  once in a hundred years young men have a chance to look for it and if they find it , they must kiss the snake and she will turn into a beautiful bride .

  yes , it 's still used in cadastral database/land registry , but together with metric system . 
  the reason they kept it is because to older people it 's easier to understand . 
  scooters are relatively popular , motorcycles not so much . 
  yes , but only for some things like eggs and roses . 
  i do n't remember hearing it for drinks , perhaps sometimes for paper tissues or plastic cups . 
  and as if english and it 's 2 articles were not difficult enough , there comes german which puts them in different genders and cases . 
  we would n't say '' i saw a cat . 
  the cat was black . 
  '' , in croatian it would be '' i saw cat . 
  cat was black . '', 
  i understand them and why they are there , but it can be tricky in more complicated sentences . 
  articles . 
  we do n't have them and they still confuse me .

  just a few weeks ago our president visited a war commemoration event in dubrovnik where she distributed serbian chocolates to the children . 
  it was a bit controversial since it could be interpreted in funny ways , but it was rather hilarious before controversial . 
  however , she would n't be our scandal queen if she did n't at least try make it even more controversial , so she decided to apologize and promise to send those children croatian products . 
  the story was completely blown out of proportion and the chocolate war is still going on .

  it 's not a bad idea . 
  she 's like a successful businesswoman , what else does a president need ... 
  i never anticipated that the americans would troll us like this .

  i would say slovenia , bosnia , v4 , germany and austria , those are our main clients in the summer and with some of them we share a lot of history . 
  we do n't really have a country-romance like there is between poland and hungary , for example . 
  are you a burgendland croat ? 
  burgenland croatian is surprisingly similar to modern croatian , i expected it would be incomprehensible after almost 600 years .

  i do n't think they are ready yet . 
  my prediction is that they 'll join only after liberland and the kingdom of enclava . 
  yes , '' hrvatska '' is most likely not of slavic origin , i 've read that they might have copied the name from an asian invader tribe to appear more dangerous . 
  wow croatia big serbia small, 
   rip mountain, 
   he ascended the \u0158\u00edp mountain did he survive ? 
  seriously , you czechs go hiking even in legends . 
  according to the historians , we came from a place in today 's poland called white croatia . 
  i believe there still are people there identifying as white croats . 
  according to a folk legend , this is what happened after they came to today 's croatia ( this is a quote from 3 months ago ) :  so there were 5 brothers and 2 sisters who came to croatia , leading the 7 croatian tribes , and they spread all around croatia . 
  they were named after the eldest brother , hrvat ( croat ) , who became the prince/duke of croatia . 
  hrvat had 3 sons ( leh , \u010ceh and meh ( rus ) ) and a daughter vilina . 
  when he died , he was inherited by his 4 children . 
  the lands were at the time controlled by the romans so the 3 brothers were discussing plans on how to get rid of the roman rule . 
  the sister overheard them and revealed the plans to her lover , who was a roman general . 
  the brothers found out about their sister 's betrayal and they killed the general before he revealed their plans to anyone . 
  the romans started to gather their army to revenge for their general , but leh , \u010ceh and meh decided to escape . 
  ( their sister , vilina ( fairy ) , escaped to a cave and the fairies that lived there accepted her and she soon gave birth to a beautiful child . 
  one day when she was sunbathing in front of the cave , her brothers , who were hunting , saw her and , as a punishment for her betrayal , they decided to wall her up in a fortress ) [ source1 ] ( http://selo.hr/legenda-o-dolasku-hrvata/ ) [ source2 ] ( https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/krapina#legenda_o_.c4.8cehu.2c_lehu_i_mehu ), 
  peacock and thirsaty, 
  in croatian it 's ' \u017eeljezo ' . 
  ` gvozd ' also means forest in archaic croatian . ', 
  and if his surname is horvat , you 've got a master elite class 100 % croat . 
  it would be translated to something like '' croatio croat '' . 
  other than hrvoje , there are plenty of old croatian names ; zvonimir , domagoj , trpimir , mislav , tihomir , borna , ... 
  i know , i was watching and cheering for raiven last year .

  is n't it ? 
  i 've heard it from other people , it 's a conversation starter : '' did you know it 's only called french but it 's actually macedonian ? '', 
  it does , your russian salad is the same as french salad in croatia, 
  we also make zserbo and it 's not the same . 
  this is like a mix between zserbo and dobos torta . 
  french salad ( francuska salata ) - it 's actually macedonian the hungarian ? 
  ( ma\u0111arica ) - a chocolate dessert ; the name is not completely misleading , it 's a croatian dessert which is probably a hybrid between two hungarian desserts,
