  also , dutch language is often described as the easiest for an english speaker to learn . 
  that 's hilarious :'d, 
  i 'll go with vatican once again, 
  not on a street , but it 's difficult to miss a [ croatian ski suit ] ( http://www.telegram.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pavlek-656x365.jpg ), 
  last three elections : presidential 2015 second round - 59,05 % parliamentary 2015 - 60,82 % parliamentary 2016 ( snap ) - 52,59 %, 
  a lot of bosnians i know have someone in the netherlands and amsterdam is a very popular destination for a high school graduation trip . 
  but it does n't come up in a conversation very often . 
  yes , '' holandija '' is something we would use for the netherlands only when acting silly around friends , speaking in serbian or bosnian accent . 
  holland ( holandija ) - never england ( engleska ) - very often , it 's easier to pronounce than '' ujedinjeno kraljevstvo '' and no one would know what you are talking about if you just said '' uk '' with croatian pronunciation yankees - never , it 's either '' amerikanci '' or , colloquially , '' ameri '', 
  i 've seen it , but i do n't follow it as i do n't know much about schulz or why he became a meme so i do n't think i would get the jokes . 
  we have a lot of remains from the roman times and even a few emperors were born in what is today croatia . 
  however , i do n't think people identify with it at all , it 's seen as the times when slavs had n't arrived here yet , even though they obviously mixed with the roman citizens and they are equally our ancestors as the slavs . 
  so i would say it 's just a footnote in this area 's history . 
  people from split might have a different opinion , as they still live inside the diocletian 's palace . 
  what about andorra ? 
  once you join russia , you never leave russia, 
  hungary , of course . 
  everything else would be a pretty dumb choice . 
  it would be quite difficult to resist that slovenian 2-boat navy , though . 
  most countries have more than just one climate type . 
  so my answer is no . 
  i live in a moderate continental climate , but i am only about 2 hours away from a mediterranean climate and i pass through a cold mountain climate on the way there . 
  but you do have a plane ? 
  i think the eu should now more focus on its internal issues , although it appears it will most likely be montenegro that will soon share the spot of the 28th member state with us . 
  ( unless iceland surprises us , or maybe canada - i would love that , nothing 's impossible ), 
  vatican - no elaboration needed, 
   supposedly we have the only statue to him outside france , but i 'm not sure how true that is . 
  we have [ one in makarska ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/@43.3057324,17.008285,3a,75y,242.06h,84.14t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1scv1urndszzqvcb0oea3vyq!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1?hl=hr ) , but it 's not nearly as fancy as yours . 
  [ the obvious ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_holocaust_in_the_independent_state_of_croatia ), 
  it 's seen as an attack which caused the us to join ww2 . 
  a lot of people have seen the movie , as well . 
  oh , you bit . 
  prepare for a thorough explanation that it 's all german , austrian , croatian , slovenian fault that yugoslavia collapsed . 
  yep , they 're everywhere . 
  not only on a roadside , you can go hiking somewhere random and you 'll find one . 
  yes , the best i 've tried is [ this one from dm ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/migration_catalog/dsc_5376/1683900/alternates/free_380/dsc_5376 ) . 
  it 's not as sticky as the orange ones from the supermarkets . 
  have you seen their supermarkets ? 
  they 're like dessert paradises , full of oriental delights , half of the supermarket is just cakes . 
  i could n't believe my eyes . 
  and it 's cheap , too . 
  ( the supermarket was called robot ), 
  i thought it went like this : croatian waters --  international waters --  italian waters . 
  however , i was corrected here recently for saying that we do n't border italy . 
  our borders apparently do meet at some narrow places in the northern adriatic sea where there are no international waters . 
  bosnia & herzegovina : food and their sense of humor ; probably the nicest people on the earth are bosniaks slovenia : we have a lot in common , mostly that we are both very jealous countries and that we love to hate each other hungary : i like that they 're aliens who speak an unknown extraterrestrial language . 
  we 're not too different and we share a lot of culture and history , but it always surprises me when i find out about a custom that we share . 
  serbia : i like that we are nemeses and i would n't change it , but i wish it was on the same level as it is with slovenia , that we can have football games without booing at each other 's anthems . 
  i also like serbian humor , just like bosnian , as we have nothing domestic . 
  montenegro : i like their hedonistic approach to life :d italy : almost everything , mostly food, 
   croatia has a president that looks ( looked ) great in bikini . 
  all of those photos are fake except for [ this one ] ( http://www.digidunia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kolinda_grabar_kitarovic_12.jpg ) , but that 's not really a bikini . 
  literally all the content in it is yugo-nostalgia . 
  how does a yugo-nostalgic subreddit have anything to do with reality ? 
  first that came to mind is this one from serbia , it was published before their election earlier this year and made news even in croatia : [ beogradski sindikat - sistem te la\u017ee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkszmpnzf-o ) ( btw , nothing happened , the same person won almost 50 % of the vote ) . 
  from croatia , well , [ this weird thing ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxsxihincbc ) , i have no idea what it 's about , they are just making fun of our former pm , jadranka kosor .

  it 's not that , we also call those * \u017eerbo kocke * , they are common for christmas , as well . 
  with a little research i found out that it 's a croatian version of * dobos torte * in the style of * zserbo * , without the caramel on top . 
  i do n't know , probably not , it 's a simple dish . 
  the most common in my family were the cooked ones with cottage cheese . 
  they are widely known just as '' \u0161trukli '' , but officially referred to as '' zagorski \u0161trukli '' to indicate where they originated from , they are not called like that just because they are made in one specific way . 
  there are all kinds of zagorski \u0161trukli , too - salty , sweet , cooked , baked ... 
  they are not necessarily gratinated , either . 
  you certainly do , i ate it in maribor, 
   are you now claiming chocolate as well ? 
  no , but i 'm sure we could have another go on zagorski \u0161trukli . 
  okay , povitica is slovenian and only slovenian , despite the fact it is recognized as both slovenian and croatian traditional dessert . 
  but dr.janez said it and that 's how it is . 
  you win . 
  can we now finally stop this stupid argument about a dessert that is not even dipped in chocolate ? 
  yes , but not where i 'm from . 
  they are popular down south , in dalmatia . 
  we 'll just have to agree that we do n't agree . 
  that person [ explored the povitica recipes in slovenia ] ( http://www.emka.si/potice-iz-slovenije/pr/1599794 ) , there is no mention of him going to the neighboring nw croatia , where we claim it to come from . 
  if there was proof , it would 've already gotten a geographical indication of origin label . 
  the fact that there was no border makes it even more difficult to distinguish where a 500 + year old dessert came from . 
  fortunately , croatia and slovenia never had a war so we had to invent something else to argue about . 
  okay , so what are you saying then ? 
  that 's it 's only croatian ? 
  because it obviously is native here . 
  there is absolutely no proof of the exact location of origin , those are only your unfounded theories . 
  no , it 's not the same as \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i and burek , we are not claiming them to be croatian , either , because they are obviously not - starting with the names . 
  slovenian and croatian arguing about products ? 
  well , i 'm not trying to say that it 's not slovenian , i 'm saying that it 's croatian as much as it is slovenian . 
  yeah , well the croatian name for it is * povitica * . 
  the '' polish thing '' was a sarcastic response to your comment that we stole it from slovenia , as if it was invented 20 years ago . 
  well , it 's obviously not, 
  honey , we all stole it from poland :p, 
  team poppy seeds here, 
   the ma\u0111arica look good - is it just chocolate and wafer ? 
  yes  and are orehnja\u010da / makovnja\u010da cinnamon and nuts , chocolate or something ? 
  it is some sort of filling with walnuts/poppy seeds , but i do n't know what else goes in it . 
  no cinnamon and chocolate afaik .
