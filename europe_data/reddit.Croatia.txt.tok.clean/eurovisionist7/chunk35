  it 's fine in small doses , but some dalmatians drag out words so much that you start wondering if they are having a stroke .

  traditionally , we do n't decorate the trees inside our houses before the december 24th , although some people do . 
  on st. lucia ( december 13th ) we plant our [ christmas wheat ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gqm8bnq.jpg ) which is meant to be fully grown for christmas . 
  you can also plant it on st.barbara ( december 4th ) but then it will become yellow sooner . 
  on christmas eve we eat dry cod fish stew , and on christmas day we eat turkey with [ mlinci ] ( http://cdn.coolinarika.net/image/mlinci-7ef29a7efc7214328bb3d5e8bd202f66_view_l.jpg?v=0 ) .

  an alcoholic starlet who makes money only off of her beauty . 
  bad hofgastein/bad gastein ( austria ) - the most charming , bad gastein is sort of like a small version of karlovy vary , great hotels and great ski tracks . 
  somewhere in slovakia , ca n't remember the name - it was quite cheap , not as crowded and we got a modern and spacious mountain house that was right on the track . 
  the only downside was that it was far from everything else and there were only a few restaurants . 
  i wish i could remember what it was called . 
  ( if any slovak could help - i think it 's somewhere near both czech and polish border , or maybe just polish ... btw i was 12 or 13 when i went there ) 3 . 
  mariborsko pohorje ( slovenia ) ; nassfeld ( austria ) ; kronplatz ( italy ) - amazing ski resorts , the reason i put them in 3rd place is because there were too many of my fellow countrymen in their checkerboard ski suits for my taste . 
  au\u010d !, 
  ssssssss !, 
  well , he 's not my president , i have nothing to hope for . 
  i 'm expecting him to be an even bigger idiot than bush was . 
  however , i am really concerned about his denial of climate change . 
  what 's the point of this question ? 
  do you know what 's the capital of burkina faso ? 
  - it 's ouagadougou !,

  '' se '' is a shortened version of '' sebe '' , you probably have it in czech,

  - two women walk down the street , one is czechia herself , the other is slovakia herself . 
  ( \u010ce\u0161ka means both czech republic and scratching yourself ) - it 's very difficult to explain as english has no cases .

  it 's quite common for people to own a vacation home , not necessarily a cottage . 
  some people have one in the countryside , some on the coast . 
  it 's also common that they use the property for gardening and winemaking . 
  you live in the vukovar water tower ? 
  orban is the pm, 
  okay , i know who the last president of austria was and i know that the next one will be either hofer or van der bellen . 
  true , i do n't know who the president is right now . 
  you do n't know putin ? 
  i know slovenian , serbian , some bosnian ( idk how many there are ) , german , french , russian , polish , czech and austrian . 
  oh , and i know the name of the lithunian president - dalia , and her surname is something like gyrboursshdbfistub . 
  good to know , amazing how i never noticed it during the sports events . 
  omg , why does poland have the same melody as the yugoslavian anthem ? 
  oh , so it 's crazy . 
  are you crazy or trolling , or both ? 
  those are n't recycled words , though . 
  yes , i am aware of the jokes and we joke at ourselves sometimes ( sebi\u0107 = selfie ) . 
  there is an institution which comes up with croatian alternatives for foreign words , anyone can send their suggestions and even win awards for the best new word of the year . 
  some words become popular , some do n't . 
  fortunately , '' zrakomlat '' did n't come to life in everyday use , it 's still '' helikopter '' . 
  '' zrakoplov '' did , but '' avion '' is still very common . 
  how ? 
  yes , we returned a lot of the old words but usually for the same things they meant earlier . 
  no , not black rice . 
  this one is normal , white rice but you add cuttlefish ink which colors it black . 
  black risotto ? 
  yes , if they are in eurovision they are european to me . 
  no , at least not the '' gymnasium '' students . 
  vocational school students probably do work . 
  i 'm not offended by it , it just does n't make sense to me nor do i see a point of it . 
  by that definition you can call the entire western europe a peninsula . 
  well , you are wrong . 
  investigate about the negative connotations of that word if you are interested , i told you everything i knew about it as a croat . 
  well , god knows what they considered a peninsula back then . 
  i still stand by my opinion that it 's a pseudopeninsula . 
  also , i do n't understand why should a name be forced upon countries that do n't identify with it . 
  geographical term for what exactly ? 
  i need exact borders . 
  that 's why croatia can not be put in one single category . 
  it 's simply on the crossroads , i do n't understand why it 's so difficult to understand . 
  a person from zagreb is much more culturally similar to a person from budapest or bratislava , than to a person from split , despite the fact they are from the same country . 
  calling zagreb southern europe is ridiculous , it literally has no similarity . 
  what region ? 
  no , we were n't conquered , at least get the facts right . 
  we supported and chose the monarchs ourselves . 
  if you had been to zagreb you would have noticed that every second building is in yellow habsburg color . 
  split is an old roman palace with ancient buildings so it 's not really comparable . 
  also , most coastal cities were built much earlier than the ones on the continent . 
  yes , what does this have to do with croatia again ? 
  we share a lot of history and culture with hungary , slovakia , slovenia , czech republic and austria , do n't you think ? 
  could you give me a source of that map , or an information about it ? 
  for a peninsula it 's a relatively new term , not to be confused with balkan mountains in bulgaria . 
  balkan peninsula is a pseudopeninsula . 
  balkan is usually a cultural term . 
  obviously , i 'm joking . 
  but it 's true that people in ex-yu countries , especially in slovenia and croatia , do n't like to be associated with that word because they feel they historically and culturally do n't belong there . 
  which is true to some degree , slovenia and croatia were under a-h and venetian influence through most of their history , while the rest of the ex-yu countries were not , excluding vojvodina . 
  well , you are getting better !,
