  murmansk never freezes, 
  so is australia , even more . 
  the only real isolation they have is of political nature . 
  in other words : - what do you think about russia ? 
  - usa is bad !, 
  i love everything about it , except for their government/president/dictator . 
  thankfully , we are one of the post-communist countries where they have no influence . 
  i also do n't understand the urge of the biggest country on the planet to have even more territory . 
  a person ( m/f ) from croatia is a croat . 
  the language is croatian . 
  the adjective is croatian . 
  i always thought vaderbilt is the americanized version of '' van der bilt '' , but i guess it 's correct both ways ? 
  spoiler alert : we die in the end, 
  they are all the same and either about their size or coast length . 
  - how do slovenes change gears ? 
  - first , second - austria !, 
  do n't ruin my proud corny croatian dad joke, 
  i love slovenia,

  how ? 
  during the k.u.k. 
  times , we were a kingdom within an empire . 
  we existed , the monarch held the title of literally the king/queen of croatia , among others . 
   barbara of celje is a direct ancestor of modern european royal families . 
  here also known as the black queen i just posted a story about her in [ another thread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askeurope/comments/5a8aup/tell_us_some_spooky_stories_from_your/d9ehvh9/ ) . 
  i can only think of this : \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af black queen is the most infamous mythical resident of zagreb . 
  she is a diabolic lady in long black robes , hence the name . 
  but her name also perfectly suits her vicious personality , knowledge of evil magic , ability to shapeshift , not to mention she even made pact with the devil on at least one occasion . 
  she was a cruel ruler , a witch , a snake and a fearsome dark apparition on the forest pathways . 
  black queen once ruled the [ medvedgrad castle ] ( http://2016.fantastic-zagreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/medvedgrad-web.jpg ) , a medieval city that rises above zagreb on the slopes of the medvednica mountain . 
  historians tend to find the source of folktales about her viciousness in actual female rulers of the castle . 
  their leading choice is barbara of cilli , a countess and queen that was obviously quite unpopular in the northwestern croatia . 
  she was also the one who supposedly walled a peasant girl veronika up in another croatian castle veliki tabor , and seemed to be a mysterious vampire who sucked blood of young people in kneginec village . 
  but , even if the latter stories are not likely to be believable , barbara of cilli could have easily deserved her black queen reputation for many historical reasons . 
  the fact that she was a foreigner who gained power over many croatian towns aside , the woman was quite an intriguing , daring and mystical figure . 
  she was a bold and deceitful politician and a brave woman who was not afraid to stand up to her husband ( we 're talking 15th century ) . 
  she was also widowed at the age of 46 , and afterwards she could n't have been found wearing anything but black dresses . 
  and most interesting of all , she practiced alchemy . 
  what else could such a character trigger in those days , if not folk tales that would adorn her with a ghastly supernatural identity . 
  be that as it may , stories about the black queen form a colourful part of local folklore . 
  so , why bother to spoil their magic with attempts to connect them with a real-life person ? 
  it might just be more romantic to preserve the fantasy within the folk tales by thinking of the black queen as indigenous dweller of medvednica woods . 
  although local folk lets the black queen myths slip into oblivion , her remembrance still exists . 
  you can still hear the children playing a game crna kraljica jen , dva , tri ( black queen , one , two , three ) with one child acting as her majesty and others doing the peasants . 
  their goal is to approach her from behind and take over her place , but she must n't notice that they are moving when she turns around . 
  indeed , there were many fearsome stories of black queen mistreating people . 
  her numerous lovers , for example , who would end up thrown out the windows after she got enough of them . 
  or her peasants . 
  she had a giant raven that terrorized the surrounding settlements . 
  it used to peck and chew off the meat of poor villagers until they 'd gone unconscious of pain . 
  people were even saying she was keeping lions . 
  the story is not as unbelievable as it seems - there indeed was a habitat of wild cats near the castle . 
  but the animal she is certainly most connected to is snake . 
  there are many stories in zagreb surroundings that involve cursed treasure guarded by snakes . 
  most of those stories are connected to the black queen folklore . 
  and here 's what made her turn into a snake : when the turks attacked medvedgrad fort , there was no one who would stand by the black queen to defend it . 
  therefore , she decided to evoke the only one who was more acquainted to the black magic than she was -- the devil himself . 
  if he would defend her , she promised to give him medvedgrad in return . 
  of course , she did n't mean it quite like that ... 
  when the castle was saved , she figured out a way to trick the devil . 
  still , the devil was even more of a trickster . 
  she ended up cursed . 
  she is still residing somewhere beneath medvedgrad in the form of a snake , guarding her gold . 
  who ever tried to find the treasure beneath the old town , never returned from that quest . 
  and that 's just a small part of rich traditions regarding the black queen . 
  we did n't hear of an encounter for decades . 
  the last one who saw her was a soldier boy whom she addressed in the form of a snake , although it might have been another snake princess . 
  she asked him to kiss her , but he refused . 
  too bad for him , for he had the chance to win the treasure of medvedgrad . 
  she now has to wait a hundred more years for a day when it 'll be possible to remove the spell . 
  who knows , it might be just when you decide to take a hike on the mountain medvednica ... 
  i do n't think you would be successful :p my grandma tells me stories that they were afraid of usta\u0161e and nazis in the ww2 , but the italians were only stealing food and no one was afraid of them . 
  it 's more like half of slovenia is italian in 1936 ... 
  no , we have fa\u0161nik / ma\u0161kare in february . 
  it 's not drava but sava . 
  i 'm from zagreb on the good side of river sava .

  it 's also know as the day to avoid some roads in zagorje , as those zagorci are prone to getting wasted and driving . 
  two of the most popular christmas songs with religious lyrics : [ narodi nam se kralj nebeski ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzvvcuo0qik ) , [ radujte se narodi ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15hclnudk9g ) well , the most popular religious song in croatia is [ this version of ave maria ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh-9rxnz_yo ) by our most respectable singer , josipa lisac , so i can not not mention it . 
  well , portuguese sounds like they are complaining all the time when speaking and czech sounds childish to me .

  it 's very loud , probably a lot . 
  yes , probably .
