  now they also come here . 
  i do n't know what is this power of ikea , i even regularly see cars from serbia and montenegro at zagreb 's ikea ... 
   almost cried the first time i saw the alps , because of how beautiful it is . 
  this was my exact reaction when i went to land salzburg . 
  it just looked so surreal . 
  and it was just a random location by the road where we stopped for a rest . 
  people think favorably of austria , it is perceived as a role model and its policies very often influence the ones in croatia . 
  naturism as a way of life is probably not as popular as in , for example , germany , but we have a very long tradition with that kind of tourism so people are very liberal about it . 
  if you are asking about nudity in general , well , people love it . 
  with the new government , the far righters have been politically decapitated . 
  we are now expecting to see their plans , as there are 2 potential dissidents from the centre-right party in the parliament , one of them , the dismissed pro-nazi minister of culture . 
  this is the first time that no far-right party has been elected in the parliament , so they are probably planning to separate and create their own party . 
  - [ hymn to the freedom ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh4ppotfyc0 ) - de facto the second anthem of croatia and the anthem of dubrovnik . 
  it was written by a ragusan writer ivan gunduli\u0107 in the early 17th century and it basically glorifies the freedom dubrovnik was so proud of :  oh you beautiful , oh you dear , sweet liberty , the gift that almighty god gave us , the cause of truth and all our glory , the only adornment of dubrava ; neither all the silver and gold , nor the human lives can match your pure beauty !, 
  - [ mojoj majci ( ru\u017ea hrvatska ) - to my mother ( croatian rose ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu7d5y4pwtk ) - written by jasenko houra when his mother died . 
  the song , however , became an anthem for savka dab\u010devi\u0107-ku\u010dar ( pm of yugoslavia ) , an activist of the [ croatian spring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_spring ) during yugoslavia . 
   in her room i enter quietly  really quietly , on my toes  i 'm scared i might slam the door too loudly  the last croatian rose has fallen asleep   and only now when she 's gone  who will wake me up in the morning  and only now when you 're gone , i know very well  you were the last croatian rose  ... - [ my homeland ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0pkho8kpfk ) - it was a charity song released during the war of independence  ...  my homeland , my homeland  has the strength of golden wheat  has the eyes the color of the sea  my country croatia  ... 
  i was surprised too that molly did n't do better in 2014 , but we can not be blamed for not giving points to electro velvet or [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhmb58nzips ), 
  we are split on that , we have the people who cross the street when there is no traffic , and then the people like me who awkwardly stand and wait for the green light . 
  - some people believe serbia is purposely causing us drought and bad weather with haarp systems . 
  - our president used to be member of the trilateral commission , led by david rockefeller , so she 's obviously a member of the illuminati . 
  - an audio tape of the slovenian foreign minister talking to an arbitrary judge was given to us by the americans , because slovenia started to distant itself from the us and flirt too much with russia . 
  - some people do n't believe in holocaust in croatia, 
  no , lol . 
  \u010cokolino is chocolate flakes + milk . 
  it was created with babies in mind , but it became popular among all ages . 
  ajvar is actually not croatian , but it 's popular here . 
  it 's serbian , so it makes sense . 
  it 's originally slovenian , but it 's our yugoslav cola . 
  i actually find it much better than the original cola , you should try the lime & ginger or tangerine cockta , if you do n't like the original one . 
  yes , i forgot about it . 
  cockta , too . 
  [ ajvar ] ( http://www.grannyssecret.com/assets/uploads/pictures/proizvodi/ajvar/en-ajvari/en-ajvar-classic-200.jpg ) - a bread spread made from bell peppers , eggplants and other vegetables .

  [ kulen ] ( http://www.index.hr/images2/kulen_2112013_shutter625.jpg ) - a type of sausage from slavonia [ \u010cokolino ] ( http://cdn.coolinarika.net/image/47cbae6461c449e42fd74fabd304ffb2_header.jpg?v=1 ) - breakfast food [ \u010cevapi ] ( http://www.epula.info/pecenjara-mons/2931/87278384.jpg ) and [ burek ] ( https://www.urimage.link/images/2015/12/13/917792861b3b60b40786732c54da15d9.jpg ) - the best of bosnian cuisine, 
  from the westernmost part of zagreb to bregana ( slovenia ) it 's 17,1 km or 15 minutes according to [ google maps ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/dir/45.7859122,15.8396262/bregana,+obre%c5%beje,+slovenija/@45.8289899,15.753023,12z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x4765c90559827c3d:0xcada52e5e31f049a!2m2!1d15.6946926!2d45.845066 ) . 
  however , i live in the northern part of zagreb and i need an extra 35 minutes to the westernmost parts . 
  note that these are not the most popular baby names : male : hrvoje , tomislav , tihomir , zvonimir , mislav , domagoj , kre\u0161imir female : dunja , vi\u0161nja , ljiljana , cvita , jasna , sanja , ivan\u010dica , jagoda unisex : borna, 
  of course , especially now that pernar is accusing people of illuminati and selling their souls to the devil . 
  no , non-swimmers are not common . 
  we have a testing in the 2nd or 3rd grade of the elementary school where you have to swim to the end of the pool and pe teachers are observing your swimming . 
  if they conclude that you ca n't swim well enough , you have to attend a swimming course for a couple of weeks , until you learn . 
  to be completely honest , i miss the days when literally no one was interested in zagreb . 
  a few years ago i could take a ride in our funicular to the upper town alone , peacefully . 
  now i walk because it 's impossible to do it without the hordes of asian tourists and their selfie sticks . 
  but , of course , i would not want those days to return because this is way better for our economy . 
  dami was robbed !, 
  yes + [ australia is already on its way here ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/24/world/what-in-the-world/australia-continental-drift-location-gps.html?_r=0 ), 
  everyone likes portugal, 
  frauke petry ? 
  well , croatia almost completely exterminated its jews in the ww2 so that 's probably where the assumption for croatia comes from . 
  we also have problems with football hooligans and deadbeats , and their holocaust chants . 
  however , they are directed almost exclusively against the serbs . 
  especially because there are virtually no jews in croatia . 
  well , you also knew he was slovene before you heard him speak . 
  that guy sounds exactly like someone from croatia or serbia would . 
  yeah , bulgaria sounds different , they linger the words a bit more . 
  i know they do , they differ here , as well . 
  but if i had zero knowledge about a person speaking , i doubt that i would be able to tell if they are from slovenia , bulgaria , bosnia ... 
  slovenes sort of have a higher pitch [ on the letter '' i '' ] ( https://youtu.be/n9iti68jwys?t=245 ) , but i do n't think i could overall distinguish their accent from croatian or serbian . 
  no , at least i 've never seen it, 
  this one is an 160 and it 's an eco version ( blue efficiency ) , so i guess it struggles a bit more than the 180 , 
  haha my mum also has an a-class but from 2011 , it 's very practical and cheap to maintain but does n't look very attractive + it 's a very loud diesel , like a tractor . 
  the new generation really does look impressive . 
  i think they go hiking unplanned , they see a mountain and it attracts them like a magnet , they want to see what 's up there . 
  and they do it in sandals and flip flops . 
  those are not misconceptions , those are 100 % true .

  omg hungary, 
  but she 's a hypocrite , she kisses with andrzej duda 3 times without any hesitation . 
  our last government collapsed 4 months ago , after only 6 months , because the first vice president of the government was in a conflict of interest . 
  some examples : - minister of economy ( 2011-2015 ) gave information about our seabed to a norwegian oil company for free . 
  information that our national company has been collecting for decades . 
  i can bet that he will end up in jail in approximately 1-2 years . 
  - our former prime minister ( 2003-2009 ) is serving his sentence in jail for high treason . 
  - culture minister ( 2011-2015 ) spending money from the official credit card , had to resign . 
  - minister of veterans had to leave after only a week in office this january . 
  he registered his address to be some old , wooden 3m2 hut outside of zagreb to avoid taxes . 
  sounds like kajkavian croatian to me,

  * returns ban jela\u010di\u0107 statue to the original position *, 
  - nikola \u0160ubi\u0107 zrinski - he led an army of 2,300 croatian and hungarian soldiers against the 102,000 turks in 1566 , to protect the fortress of szigetv\u00e1r . 
  he was offered leadership of croatia under ottoman influence , but he refused . 
  he and his soldiers all died in the battle , but they caused great losses on the ottoman side , who then withdrew instead of going to the final target , vienna . 
  - ban josip jela\u010di\u0107 - united croatian lands inside the monarchy , abolished serfdom . 
  and more . . but i do n't want to anger the hungarians , he is considered a traitor on the other side of the drava .

  it 's a really old joke , but whatever you say :p, 
  sorry , you did n't protect it in the european commission as an autochthonous slovenian joke . 
  but seriously , how is it a slovenian joke ? 
  everyone knows about the austrian basements joke . 
  yes , but they 're not used for leisure time . 
  unless you 're an alcoholic . 
  i hear austrians have great basements , though .
