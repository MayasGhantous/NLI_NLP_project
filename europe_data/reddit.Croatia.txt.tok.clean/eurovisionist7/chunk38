  the most popular '' cereal '' here is [ \u010cokolino ] ( http://coko.lino.eu/images/dist/productcokolino.png ) .

  ** article 152 ** the amendments to the constitution shall enter into force on the day of their promulgation , the 16th day of june 2010 , with the exception of article 9 , paragraph ( 2 ) pertaining to execution of a decision on extradition or surrender in compliance with the acquis communautaire of the european union , and article 133 , paragraph ( 4 ) and articles 144 , 145 and 146 of the constitution of the republic of croatia , which shall enter into force on the date of accession of the republic of croatia to the european union . 
  that 's simply not true . 
  for example , the most common engines in europe are 4 cylinder 1.4 - 2.0 s.

  you mean you ca n't import them because their co2 emission is too low for the us ? 
  0,1 litre of rum - 9,99 hrk ( 1,4 $ ),

  it is translated to a huge pimple . 
  rhubarb pristine john travolta, 
  it 's there to protect the social rights laws . 
  so if some lawmaker in the future decides to change the laws at the expense of social rights , the constitutional court will knock them down . 
  * the republic of croatia is a unitary and indivisible democratic welfare state . 
  * * power in the republic of croatia derives from the people and rests with the people as a community of free and equal citizens . 
  * * the people excercise this power through the election of representatives and through direct decision-making . 
  yep , it 's become so bad that they are now going to allow entrance only to a limited number of people per day , since it 's a unesco site and they 're damaging it . 
  unfortunately they 're not going to film got there this year . 
  so no dubrovnik in the next season , apart from the panoramas that they 've already shot before . 
  however , they will shoot robin hood in early 2017 .

  bedroom is supposed to be the coldest room , no ? 
  some people do n't even heat their bedrooms during the winter here . 
   i just read that people in a few villages around rovinj also speak istro-romanian . 
  yes , i think [ this is it ] ( https://youtu.be/prvd_sg-wnm?t=5723 ), 
  i thought that narje\u010dje = dialect , dijalekt = subdialect in english, 
  that 's so interesting . 
  are you sure she is n't just speaking italian lol ? 
  i hear something like '' me amica me fesf . . vestiti '' haha i only know that a lot of people speak venetian in istria , but there are also dialects in dalmatia that sound very italian to me , though i 've never heard anything this close . 
  but i 'm from zagreb so i 'm not an expert . 
  i mixed [ northern and middle \u010cakavian ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/middle_chakavian.png ) . 
  tbh i 'm not very familiar with the area . 
  apparently croatian istrians and slovenian istrians speak something in which they understand each other perfectly . 
  we have 3 main dialects : kajkavian , \u010cakavian and \u0160tokavian . 
  standard croatian is the closest to \u0160tokavian , as it was based on it . 
  the first two dialects are very different from standard croatian . 
  for example , the rate of mutual intelligibility between standard croatian and kaikavian is 40 % and between standard croatian and \u010cakavian it 's 42 % . 
  they are named after different ways of saying '' what '' . 
  those dialects also have a countless number of subgroups which are again often very different ( i.e. 
  northern and southern \u010cakavian ) . 
  ** kajkavian ** : + what = kaj ; northern and northwestern parts of the country ; mix between slovenian and croatian ; a lot of german loanwords . 
  + [ example ] ( https://youtu.be/prvd_sg-wnm?t=5640 ) - bednja ** \u010cakavian ** : + what = \u010da ; istria , coastal areas , islands ; i believe ~ ~ northern ~ ~ middle \u010cakavian is identical to slovenian primorski ( if someone is from that area please confirm ) ; a lot of italian loanwords . 
  + [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hptxdcfze3u ) - northern ** \u0160tokavian ** : + what = \u0161to ; slavonia , inner dalmatia and dubrovnik , lika ; this one is the most similar to bosnian , serbian and montenegrin dialects + [ example ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvjvh9h6ply ) - lika, 
  means the same thing - river, 
  montenegro, 
  some parts of the country are similar to italy, 
  [ christoph waltz explanation ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r61ecyegbm ) that you were talking about . 
  the main catalyst was an economic crisis and wealth differences between the states . 
  it all escalated gradually to the breaking point when milosevic tried to force the belgrade-centralized system . 
  this was of course against the will of the wealthier states who wanted either a confederation or independence . 
  it should have fallen apart sooner , it was too late when it did . 
   in countries where are big differences between regions , especially ethnical and economical , you need a strong centralized government . 
  yeah , that worked well for yugoslavia ... 
  it 's difficult to figure where we belong when our country looks like a boomerang,

  they have subtitles . 
  no , croats came here when they were still worshiping their slavic gods . 
  and they were called '' croats '' even then . 
  we 're not a project of the vatican , we 're not catholic serbs who were created to exterminate the serbs .

  i do n't know how they get in because i have retractable mosquito nets on my windows ... 
  btw , is there a site where i can see how common is each coin ? 
  i did n't know they were so rare , good to know , i 'm going to save it . 
  mine is from 2015 . 
  1 euro . 
  i was surprised , too . 
  sure , but we do n't learn nearly as much about chinese dynasties as we do about the european ones . 
  at least that was the case in my school . 
  we learn about all european countries , but if it 's something about a country that croatia was a part of , then we learn it in 2 parts . 
  for example , one lesson is '' maria theresia '' and the other lesson is '' croatia under the rule of maria theresia '' . 
  croatia was an independent kingdom in the middle ages , so we also learn a lot about that . 
  we do n't have euros yet , but here 's what i found in the cup where i keep foreign coins : san marino : 1 france : 1 germany : 2 austria : 2 italy : 2 spain : 4,

  russians do n't particularly like us . 
  the only propaganda i see from time to time is when the russian ambassador gives an interview for the newspapers telling that he is sad that croatia does n't like russia , disappointed in us , and so on ... '' * it 's not the french or english army that saved you in ww2 , it was the soviets !,
