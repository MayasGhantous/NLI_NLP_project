  * '' glorifying putin is at least 50 % of the interview . 
  i use it only in a semi-serious manner, 
  it means '' vulgar '' in croatian, 
  here , at least in croatia , the people who start talking to you in public transportation or in public ( in general ) usually have a loose screw . 
  maybe that 's why the people appear cold and uninterested in the conversation , it 's a situation no one expects to be talked to . 
  aorist and imperfect are alive in croatian only when you have to learn their conjugation for an exam . 
  so that 's why all those slovenes that come to croatia look like they 're preparing for the olympics, 
  hahaha , maybe it 's correct in serbian, 
  that 's '' kuda ide\u0161 '' , saying '' gdje ide\u0161 '' is incorrect , but everyone says it, 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/kxkws3oaars?t=40 ), 
  the worst has to be a police officer who threw an elderly woman on the ground for jaywalking : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6cydhapn2e, 
   `` kudy '' '' kuda '' or '' kud '' , 
  a lot of people use '' gdje '' for both cases . 
  also , informal '' di '' ( di si ? 
  ; di ide\u0161 ? ), 
  doma . 
  doma . 
  [ it 's bad ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9xdriksi7m ), 
  but our linguists make up language that 's natural only to them , so highly unlikely that will happen anytime soon, 
  we should just give up on \u010c / \u0106 and d\u017d / \u0110 already , it 's not for us . 
  and intruduce - ie instead of - ije and - je, 
  most people do n't realize the difference between '' gdje ? 
  '' ( '' where '' for the question * where are you ? 
  * ) and '' kamo ? 
  '' ( '' where '' for the question * where are you going ? 
  * ) translated to '' wo ? '', 
  in german . 
  kukuruz is also corn in croatian and kapula is onion in dalmatia, 
  our winters are cold , too . 
  i like them , 
  we have a city that 's called pula . 
  romanians think it 's hilarious , they love buying the '' i < 3 pula '' t-shirts . 
  ( pula means dick in romanian ) also , german word '' kurz '' ( '' short '' ) can sound hilarious in some grammatical cases in croatian , because it can mean dick . 
  for example , austrian foreign minister is called sebastian kurz . 
  when he arrived in croatia and our foreign minister received him , the news reported that vesna pusi\u0107 ( pussych ) received kurz in her office . 
  sounds exactly like she received the dick in her office . 
  the root . 
  i do n't know if we eat the leaves tbh, 
  romania is too hot in summer, 
  it 's not offensive , we have a square in the centre of zagreb that is named after him . 
  why ? 
  i do n't like the temperatures over 20 degrees celsius . 
  i like to chew them first :p, 
  similar here , although * 3 days * is very often replaced with * 3 hours *, 
   engolir sapos - swallowing frogs - it means someone has to hear something they do n't like we swallow the dumplings , 
  * - even if it 's your favorite guest , 3 days of him is enough . 
  yes . 
  i do n't know if it 's a requirement , but they are all meteorologists . 
  same here , except sometimes people say '' istina '' ( the truth ) . 
  i have no idea why . 
  bmk ( boli me kurac ) = my dick hurts ( literal ) = i do n't care ( idiomatic ) jbg ( jebi ga ) = fuck it \u0161bbkbb ( \u0161to bi bilo kad bi bilo ) = ? what would be , if it were ? 
  - when someone asks a hypothetical question and there is no point in answering it , then you say \u0161bbkbb . 
  in other words , '' what would happen , would happen '' ln ( laku no\u0107 ) = goodnight * a u * pm ( pizdu materinu ) = * oh , in * your mother 's pussy ( literal ) = oh , fuck ( idiomatic ) lp ( lijepi pozdrav ) = kind regards ** forbidden !, 
  ** zds ( za dom spremni ) = for homeland ready ( nazi salute , common on right-wing news sites ' comments ), 
  yes, 
  haha . 
  i actually was n't trying to be ironic , we really do have an unusual shape . 
  [ yes ] ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/travel_news/article-2764998/goli-otok-island-proposed-gay-tourist-destination-croatia.html ) , out of more than a 1000 islands , they chose that one . 
   goli otok prison camp ironically , it 's now being redesigned into a gay party hot spot . 
  well , yugoslavia was great until 4.5.1980 . 
  where is the iron curtain ? 
  not here, 
  here it 's the '' croatian embassy in london '' which says that your friend is stuck at the airport and that a certain amount of money has to be sent . 
  no , all eu countries that are not part of the eurozone are obligated to join it , except denmark and sweden, 
  because it 's a small country . 
  it 's actually more densely populated than canada . 
  yes , absolutely . 
  i mean , what is left to do ?!, 
  we 'll probably have to either build a yuge wall and make germany pay for it , or just nuke them all . 
  the situation is crazy , it is a war zone in western europe . 
  this is the ** apocalypse ** !!!, 
  look , [ this ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ursjzubiw1q ) happened in paris yesterday . 
  it 's all those fucken muslem fauls . 
  do n't we all ? 
  who knows how much oil is hiding under there !, 
  yes , how do you feel about dalmatia ? 
  do colonies of austria-hungary count ? 
  ( technically , we 're the ones who had the sea ) we had some uninhabited islands in the arctic . 
  i think they should be returned and distributed between the former k.u.k. 
  countries . 
  croatian \u0161ljivovica cures everything , let 's be honest, 
  i thought it was melania, 
  but bugatti is quite a good car, 
  - joint eu army - croatia , romania and bulgaria join schengen - more countries introduce the euro - montenegro joins the eu, 
  no , croatian dynasty has been extinct for almost a 1000 years now . 
  the habsburgs are the ones who were never dethroned . 
  they were dethroned during the independent state of croatia ( 1941-1945 ) , but since modern croatia is not its legal successor , it technically makes the head of the habsburg family a legitimate heir to the throne . 
  so , technically , they only need a 2/3 majority in the parliament to return to the throne . 
  realistically , it 's not realistic . 
  [ 2525 ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yesyhqkyrqm ), 
  nope , the results for the summer have n't even come yet :p, 
  because we 're such good people so we waited until you catch up with us . 
  but now we 're finally growing , too !, 
  they have a higher gdp per capita than portugal and greece, 
  i 've read somewhere that the royal family can in theory be introduced the same way they were dismissed , with a 2/3 in the parliament . 
  some people call it palenta , usually in dalmatia and istria . 
  has there ever been a poll on what croats think about it ? 
  jam , i forget the difference every time, 
  - [ \u017dganci ] ( http://i.imgur.com/wcy1b1p.jpg ) with milk or bacon and cheese - eggs ( soft boiled , kajgana ( scrambled ) , fried ) - [ pala\u010dinke ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jrstszt.jpg ) with marmelade - fresh cheese and cream with green onion - cereal , muesli , [ \u010dokolino ] ( http://cdn.coolinarika.net/image/prosirena-cokolino-obitelj-47cbae6461c449e42fd74fabd304ffb2_header.jpg?v=1 ), 
  not really , i do n't like the idea of hereditary power .
