  but it 's not even 100 % impossible for croatia since our last royal family still exists and they were never dethroned from the croatian throne , due to the various events . 
  we have our own version of halloween in february and it 's celebrated at carnivals like [ this one ] ( http://www.putovnica.net/files/foto/rijecki-karneval-povorka.jpg ) , where people parade trough the streets dressed up as all kinds of things ( animals , politicians , ... ) . 
  children also usually dress up for school and they go trick or treating after it . 
  the '' official '' pastry of that period is [ krafna ] ( http://www.recepti.hr/upload/imagecache/clanak/krafne.jpg ) , so they are on sale throughout february and everyone buys/makes a lot of them . 
   what is your country ? 
  croatia , i have a flair   putin souvenirs for sale in belgrade you can also see them all over the place in the serbian part of bosnia & herzegovina . 
  i find it ridiculous . 
  well , we were in the same country until recently , so i guess we know more about each other than , for example , about italy or france . 
  similar language is also a big factor . 
  for example , i sometimes almost forget that hungary is our neighbor because their language is completely different so we do n't know much about them . 
  however , slovenia and croatia are definitely western oriented , in spite of the influence of the balkan culture . 
  could you give more examples ? 
  languages of the ex-yu countries are very similar , so of course the yugoslav rock ( and other music ) is popular + a lot of people grew up on that music . 
  the only country that likes russia more than the advisable dose is serbia , because nato bombed belgrade in 1999 . 
  i do n't understand where did you get an impression that slovenia , croatia or bosnia feel more connected to russia than the eu , it makes no sense . 
  i always say this here - salzburg region , austria . 
  i had already had high expectations upon coming , but it 's inexplicable with words how beautiful it was . 
  oops , right , sorry . 
  i thought slovenia is right after us . 
  yeah , we have fanatics like that , too . 
  but they are usually occupied with vaccination conspiracy theories . 
  yes , but spain , croatia and slovenia are for some reason more successful than the rest . 
  the republic of croatia is a unitary and indivisible democratic welfare state . 
  power in the republic of croatia derives from the people and rests with the people as a community of free and equal citizens . 
  the people exercise this power through the election of representatives and through direct decision-making .

  presumed consent on organ donation if the patient is brain dead . 
  it saves so many lives . 
  yes , it 's [ a marten ] ( http://res.cloudinary.com/dk-find-out/image/upload/q_80,w_1440/a-rh-817-106705_eczyb2.jpg ), 
  haha , i 've read that in czech cura is a whore, 
  no , serbia and croatia just ca n't go together . 
  croatia is western oriented , while serbia is in love with russia . 
  yes , with the exception of slovenian and macedonian , which are not as close but still very close . 
  and a lot of them speak '' serbo-croatian '' . 
  it 's a tabu to call it a one language because of the political reasons , but let 's say they are extremely close in standard versions . 
  there are some minor differences , of course . 
  in croatia , the regional dialects are so different that a person from the northern regions has huge difficulties understanding someone from a dalmatian island , which means he better understands someone speaking standard serbian or slovenian than someone speaking a different dialect of croatian . 
  in the former yugoslavian countries , there are close business ties between them due to the fact that there is practically no language barrier . 
  also , for the same reason , musicians and other celebrities from one country are very often popular throughout the ex-yu . 
  czech '' amazing '' = croatian '' horrible '' ( u\u017easny ) croatian '' drinks '' = czech '' pussy '' ( pi\u0107a ) croatian '' similar '' = czech '' attractive '' ( sli\u010dna ), 
  here it 's considered a beer for kids, 
  maybe about hajduk , but dinamo for zagrebians is not what it used to be , now with zdravko & co. 
  sure , but do n't expect that locals will know it . ^ ^ / s, 
  reminds me of [ this ] ( https://youtu.be/j138hpgd_zm?t=7 ) , 
  '' how do you say _____ in serbo-croatian ? '', 
  hey / u/itscalledunicode and / u/the _ candle96 clone , please do n't speak to me . 
  thanks . 
  hey / u/itscalledunicode and / u/the _ candle96 clone , please do n't speak to me . 
  thanks . 
  are you yet another clone of / u/itscalledunicode and / u/the _ candle96 ? 
  can we get something in cyrillic alphabet ? 
  please !, 
  oh , right . 
  then i guess we are neighbors after all . 
  not really no . 
   low-cost flights seem ideal . 
  they have a dog and a cat , 
  i assume it 's because a lot of their population used to be ( or still is ) rural . 
  also , bosnians who came to croatia were usually uneducated construction workers . 
  they are also known for their humor and millions of jokes about fictional , naive bosnian duo , mujo and haso . 
  their language just goes so well with the jokes ( on the other hand , croatian humor is almost nonexistent , because croatian language is sterile , cold , too balanced ) . 
  a lot of the jokes are based on the stupidity of the characters , but i do n't know if those jokes started before or after the stereotype . 
  it 's : croatian waters - international waters - italian waters, 
   serbs are devils but secretly ** everyone loves their women . 
  we 're not neighbors with italy, 
   probably your eastern neighbours yeah , yeah . 
  only slovenians wear bright yellow shirts :p, 
  [ yes ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnoedtjoio ), 
  i spared montenegro , they 're land stealers , too . 
  it 's the truth and you have to embrace it . 
  ( you 're not that innocent , either . 
  we stole some things together . 
  * cough * italy * cough * ), 
  there are ethnic tensions in bosnia & herzegovina and it 's everyone vs. everyone . 
  serbia and croatia still dislike each other , but not to the level it was 25 years ago . 
  people get on very well , it 's usually the politicians who create the drama . 
  you italians keep forgetting that vatican is a country, 
  but to be fair , similar could be said for croatia . 
  they moved to slovenia and croatia during yugoslavia and most of them were construction workers . 
  slovenes - actually bosnians , land stealers hungarians - actually mongols , they like spicy food serbs - land stealers , aggressive , turks in denial bosnians - dumb , blonde muslims montenegrins - laziest nation on earth, 
  i do n't really know his history , i do n't mind if he 's from bosnia . 
  i 'm just saying that he has a bosnian accent which sounds much better in rap . 
  edo maajka has a bosnian accent and i think he is in fact from bosnia, 
  not really , croatian language is not very good for rap , it sounds cringey, 
   what animals do you eat mostly fish and poultry . 
  i do n't like pork , lamb and veal if they 're not minced , so i usually avoid them because that 's unhealthy . 
   have you ever killed an animal that you usually eat ? 
  probably not , they used to be dark blue , but this was chosen as a design after we joined the eu and there is no obligation to change it to red . 
  there is actually a weird story behind this , the minister at the time did n't want to change it to red because it was the election year and he is a social-democrat , so he did n't want people to think he changed it to red because of his party 's colors . 
  croatian + czech , hungarian , italian , sebian and slovak as officialy recognized minority languages . 
  edit : and ruthenian, 
  i can not stand him . 
  he reminds me of one of our populist politician who is a nurse but acts as if he has a phd in finance . 
   no one hates us ( no you do n't croatia ! ), 
  well , we do n't . 
  the only ones who do are old pensioners who hate everyone . 
  younger people do n't even care about the piran bay , some even ask themselves why do n't we already give it to slovenia to end that shit already . 
  lime & ginger is the best , by far !, 
  it 's a beautiful country , a popular destination over here . 
  i like [ their version of cola ] ( http://static.zena.hr/images/proizvodi/product_8915.jpg ) more than the original one and i cheer for their ski-jumpers .
