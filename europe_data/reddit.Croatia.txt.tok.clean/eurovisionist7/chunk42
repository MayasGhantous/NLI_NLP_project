  unification of all croatian lands inside the monarchy was not a small gain for croatia , along with other things . 
   can we really consider the whole country as responsible for the acts of these few ? 
  the entire countries are never responsible for wars , when i say serbia , i mean the king and the government . 
  gavrilo princip is still considered a national hero in serbia , though : http://i.imgur.com/cbosg3f.jpg, 
  it 's not edgy . 
  to be more precise , the reason that the serbian king was in power was because of that organization . 
  they ousted/murdered the members of the obrenovi\u0107 dynasty and brought the kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty on the throne in order to achieve the dream of greater serbia ( which included the territories of austria-hungary ) . 
  and it 's not like gavrilo princip was working alone , there were other members of the organization on the streets of sarajevo waiting for a chance to assassinate the prince , but gavrilo princip was at the right place when the car stopped . 
  so if it was n't him it would have been someone else . 
  there were also attempts days before when a bomb was thrown but it detonated under a car behind the royal couple . 
  technically , yes , austria-hungary declared the war on serbia , not the other way . 
  but , as i said , this is not the cause of war , it would have been started by something else if it was n't for this . 
  gavrilo princip was a member of an organization supported by the serbian king, 
  they killed the heir apparent of austria-hungary and his wife . 
  either way , this was not the cause of war . 
  if it had n't been started because of this , it would have been started because of something else . 
  [ helena of hungary , queen of croatia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/helena_of_hungary,_queen_of_croatia ) 3 . 
  it 's servus or serbus here in zagreb , some people greet with it , usually older . 
  we also have a song about it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqmolaofplm, 
  the so called independent state of croatia was a quisling regime under which a lot of our territory was given to italy . 
  however , in the beginning , before those territories were lost , many croats supported the collaboration with germany because of the tensions with the serbs and the serbian king inside the kingdom of yugoslavia who were supporting the ideas greater serbia . 
  yes , you can . 
  the accent is completely different and , like panceltic said , they pronounce \u010d an \u0107 with a bigger contrast , while croats pronounce both \u010d and \u0107 like something in between those two letters . 
  same thing for \u0111 and d\u017e . 
  they also conjugate verbs differently . 
  for example , '' i like to organize '' would be '' volim organizirati '' in croatian and '' volim ** da ** organiz ** ujem ** '' in serbian edit : yes , they also have a lot of different words from us , but we understand most of them . 
  croats also use much more diminutives , so serbs like to say that serbian is more masculine . 
  it depends on who am i talking to . 
  if it 's someone from northern croatia , then kajkavian croatian . 
  if it 's someone from the other parts of the country , then i try to speak/write in standard croatian . 
  kajkavian differs a lot from standard croatian , it 's close to slovenian . 
  however , a lot of people speak a mix between kajkavian and standard croatian , especially in zagreb . 
  i have seen this already but there is no proof of that , it could be a coincidence . 
  no , it would n't necessarily be like the russian one , it was an agreement to use those three colors , the pattern was not defined , which is why czechia and serbia have different patterns . 
  there is a legend about the croatian checkered coat of arms , the flag is just pan-slavic colors . 
  kingdom of croatia was often in wars with venice , so in one of the wars with them the king of croatia , stjepan dr\u017eislav , was caught and imprisoned . 
  the venetian doge , pietro ii orseolo , overheard that the king was good at chess , so he offered him a deal : if he beats him at 3 games of chess , he will be released and allowed to return home . 
  the king beat him and orseolo kept his word . 
  in gratitude , the king decided that the checkered crest will represent him and his people . 
  in reality , it probably just represented white and red croatia . 
  get on [ iceland 's ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkydpogtjkk ) level . 
  i think the [ uk ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga9yyy2yh20 ) still beats you all , overall . 
  september is less touristy than august , it 's a very nice place , do n't worry . 
  + maybe you find a billionaire soul mate in the marina , perhaps ivanka trump is still there , or bernie ecclestone if you like older . 
  i was only once at the istanbul airport on a layover . 
  the people at the airport were very nice , nothing to complain about . 
  i would like to go mostly because of food and architecture , but i think i 'll wait a few years when it , hopefully , becomes safer . 
  croatia - [ stone soup ] ( http://www.gastronomika.hr/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/juha-od-kamena-brujo-310x250.jpg ) - you take a stone from the sea which has small organisms and algae inside the small holes , you cook it and get a delicious soup - in a few places in croatia people eat [ dormice ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zparqz0.jpg ) . 
  apparently it was popular during the roman times but it retained only in croatia and slovenia . 
  - also , in croatia , people eat sea urchins directly from the sea as a delicacy or in a soup ( the inside , not the spines ) , i do n't know if other countries do this . 
  wow , just googled it . 
  thanks . 
  i would like to visit reykjavik , dublin and berlin . 
  i 've been to : zagreb ( home ) , ljubljana , sarajevo , vienna , budapest , bratislava , prague , rome , vatican city ? , london and lisbon . 
  i 've also been in istanbul airport if that counts . 
  it 's worth it , but i do n't suggest staying right in the city if you are going on a beach holiday . 
  villages 20 minutes away from dubrovnik have nicer beaches which are not as crowded as in dubrovnik . 
  the major downside of dubrovnik is that it 's far away from other larger cities , while split , trogir , zadar and \u0160ibenik are all relatively close to each other . 
  next time go on that blue boat close to that beach which rides every 10 minutes and it will take you to paklinski islands . 
  i absolutely love them , infinite private beaches . 
  there is this island of hvar in croatia which is always occupied by mega yachts , but it 's not better or worse than other , less popular croatian islands . 
  friends ? 
  i would say central europeans who go on holiday in croatia , they have the longest tradition of coming here . 
  we do n't really have a bff . 
  i do n't think we have an ally , either . 
   who would you save if there were a white man and a black man drowning in bay of piran ? 
  a black man because the white man could be croatian . 
  i guess one man is on the our side of ~ ~ piran bay ~ ~ savudrijska vala , otherwise it 's impossible : * how do people swim in slovenian sea ? 
  * - * one by one , switching turns . 
  we joke about ridiculously clumsy czech tourists , slovenian small country , bosnian stupidity ( stereotypically ) and montenegrin laziness . 
  edit : slovenia : - how do slovenians switch gears ? 
  - first , second , border !, 
  - shortest joke in the world ? 
  - two friends walk along the slovenian coast ... montenegro : - why did the opposition in montenegro lose in the elections ? 
  - because they promised employment for everyone . 
  - why do montenegrins move to croatia ? 
  - because they heard there are no jobs here . 
  bosnia : - what do you do when a bosnian throws a grenade at you ? 
  - you pull out the safety pin and throw it back at him . 
  - when does a bosnian leave the roundabout ? 
  - when he starts feeling dizzy . 
  that 's so cool . 
  those are some of the most popular songs in ex-yu , indeed .

  eastern and southern parts , which are poorer and more conservative ( catholic ) , vote for hdz ( epp ) . 
   are there parts of the countryside that do n't vote along with other rural areas in your country ? 
  most of the rural population votes for the centre-right hdz , except for the serbian minority , who vote for sdp . 
  it 's chocolate flavored wheat flakes mixed with milk . 
   thick enough for the spoon to stand in it . 
  that 's basically the recipe . 
  have you tried it with cold milk ? 
   i love the new \u010dokolino plus . 
  me too . 
  but i wish they would get rid of the non-chocolate cereal in it . 
  [ \u010cokolino ] ( http://i.imgur.com/riheo9g.jpg ) - it 's a baby food , but everyone eats it and it 's consumed more by adults than babies because it 's delicious .

  that 's all i know about you .
