  i think austria is quite underrated . 
  i like their beer and of course the czech ones . 
  but i am also used to the croatian beer which basically means anything is good to me . 
  ** zlo ** venija , 
  i do n't know what is the stereotype about croatia in the world , but in the ex-yu countries they think we are cold and snobby with a bad sense of humor . 
  i do n't think it 's accurate that we 're cold and snobby , but i must confirm that our humor is horrible . 
  i think it 's because croatian language is not built for humor , so it sounds cringey , unlike bosnian or serbian . 
  i knew you did n't have \u0106 . 
  honestly , that 's very smart of you . 
  it 's useless here as most croats pronounce both \u010c and \u0106 as something in between \u010c and \u0106 . 
  slovenia is so beautiful that i could drive an entire day all around it . 
  the problem is , it takes 2 hours . 
  ( i stole that joke from a comedian ), 
  wait , slovenians do n't have \u0110 ? 
   kind of like mixing d and j together that 's \u0110 , 
  croatia is not large , but it 's bigger than slovenia . 
  that 's all it takes to start the rivalry . 
  we do n't really compare ourselves to the countries that are much larger than us , but the ones that are similar . 
  yes , they are very popular . 
  at least they were when i was a kid , i do n't know what today 's kids watch . 
  it used to be cool to have their theme song as a tune on your cellphone when i was in the elementary school . 
  krtek was also very popular when i was little . 
   there is just a group of czech tourists who are rather adventurous and know-it-alls at the same time . 
  a je to !, 
  i wonder if pat & mat have anything to do with the stereotype . 
  the stereotype about czech tourists is completely the same in croatia . 
  but you do seem to get hurt a lot . 
  we love to tell lame jokes about how small slovenia is , over and over again , but we laugh every time . 
  russia is not really seen as a threat here like it is in former soviet countries , but some croats do have anti-russian sentiment in compassion with ukraine and poland . 
  anti-chinese sentiment is not really common . 
  there are stories in the media about their regime from time to time , but people do n't really pay much attention to it . 
  anti-american sentiment is quite common because a lot of people consider the us to be responsible for the crisis in the middle east and northern africa . 
  but it 's more of an anti-nato sentiment , rather than an anti-american sentiment . 
  i mean , you could be mistaken for the japanese or the chinese , but if you are thinking of violence , then no . 
   i think they make the best ones in sarajevo this is a proven fact . 
  source : my mouth, 
  true, 
  that 's how we traditionally prepare lamb . 
  best thing ever . 
   oh how great it will be when russia joins i do n't see how that is possible with the leadership they '' choose '', 
  well , would n't you be fat if your dad/husband was an ice cream magnate ? 
  they kind of remind me of honey boo boo . 
  is he famous in slovenia too or are you laughing at his surname ? 
  or his face ?

  people in western europe who are racist towards poles , they 're racist towards anyone from eastern europe . 
  it 's just that poles are very numerous . 
  i do n't think there is a prejudice against poles in eastern europe . 
   why does n't anyone use air conditioning ? 
  it was 90 degrees outside and literally like 79 or 80 in the office . 
  no taxi drivers used air conditioning , and the hotel air conditioner ( nice hotels ) were like little fans . 
  the hotel air conditioning was so bad that i thought it was broken ( it was n't ) . 
  i did n't sleep well because i was sweating the whole time . 
  seriously , what 's up with that ? 
  i live south from frankfurt and paris , and i turn the air conditioning on only a few times in a year , during the hottest days . 
  but it does n't even run all day , i turn it on for 30-45 minutes to cool down and then i turn it off . 
  usually , you really do n't even need it , the walls are thick and all you have to do is lower the blinds in the morning . 
  in the cars , it 's quite common to have it on , unless it 's a short ride . 
  shopping centers and offices are always air conditioned . 
  cyprus and malta are the fastest you can get to another eu citizenship if you have millions of $ to invest in them . 
   what makes it so that serbia has a right to kosovo ? 
  well , that 's only my opinion . 
  kosovo is very historically and culturally important to the serbian nation , if you look at serbia 's unesco world heritage sites , most of them are medieval monasteries of serbian orthodox church in kosovo . 
  those are real treasures of a country 's history . 
  i ca n't imagine if , for example , our region , dalmatia , was separated from croatia . 
  it 's like someone taking away your history from you just because you became a minority in your own territory . 
  lol , serbia has all the rights to both kosovo and an opinion . 
  no , i do n't consider it a country . 
  it 's just an opinion and i believe serbia has all the rights to it . 
  if i considered kosovo a country , then i would perhaps consider the ` republic of serbian krajina ' , an occupied croatian territory in the 1990s ( with the serb majority ) , a country , as well . 
  they were under a huge russian influence , and russian culture is european . 
  why is this so important , anyway ? 
  is culture only about religion and language , though ? 
  well , it 's also debatable that europe and asia are separate continents . 
  i trust modern geographers more , old ones thought earth was a flat surface , after all . 
  culturally , i agree , azerbaijan is more asian than it is european . 
  okay . 
  even then , azerbaijan is a transcontinental country . 
  a small part of it is indeed on the european continent . 
  i think my username explains my understanding of ` europe ', 
  croatia - land of 1000 islands slovenia - sunny side of the alps azerbaijan - land of fire iceland - land of fire and ice finland - land of 1000 lakes, 
  yeah . 
  i meant countries where most of the people are mongoloid . 
  slovenes - janezi ( plural of janez , a popular male given name in slovenia ; it 's a nickname used to make fun of slovenes , but not in a mean way ) germans - \u0160vabi serbs - \u010cetnici ( this is a negative/offensive nickname ; chetniks ) albanians - \u0160iptari ( it 's similar to how they call themselves , but it 's used as a negative connotation ) macedonian - makedon\u010de any asian country - chinese/japanese americans - ameri ( just a shortened version of amerikanci ), 
  we were taught that there were mayans , aztecs , incas and inuits , and we had to know where they lived . 
  we also learned some old cities from which i remember only machu picchu and tenochtitlan + chichen itza pyramid . 
  mass killings after european colonization and camps in which they were kept were also mentioned , but not in detail . 
  it 's just very awkward . 
  people get confused with it as they do n't know if you are expecting the meaningless '' i 'm fine , and how are you ? '', 
  answer or something more . 
  usually the ones who ask the '' how are you ? '', 
  question are the people close to you and they mean it when they ask it . 
  you 'll be fine with english , you can only google the greetings . 
  just do n't ask a european the ` how are you ? ', 
  question . 
  they were translated . 
  the subject itself is called ` croatian language ' , you have it 8 years ( elementary school ) + 4 years ( secondary school/gymnasium ) and it 's compulsory . 
  you chronologically learn about european , croatian and some world literature , from ancient to modern times . 
  we did read some songs in both croatian and it 's original language .
