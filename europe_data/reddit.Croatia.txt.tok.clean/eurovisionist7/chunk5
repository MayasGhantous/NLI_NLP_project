   anything you think i should know before moving ? 
  you might find it difficult to get used to the fact that 99,99 % of the people around you are white , since you 've lived in multicultural countries . 
  also , zagreb in the summer is not very alive , since everyone is on the coast . 
  i ca n't think of any other things , if anything else interests you , ask me . 
  well , if you know german and you 're an eu citizen , i would suggest vienna since you can study with austrians for free , whereas the programmes in english are paid . 
  international programmes are usually less competitive , though . 
  i myself am studying medicine in zagreb ( in croatian ) , if you have any questions . 
  i thought you were catholic, 
  is that a common thing in n.america to use that referral or is it just you ? 
  we do n't have snl but that is pretty accurate . 
  it 's also even more likely that he will be involved in a fatal car crash and die on the way to the airport . 
  he is even more likely to die in a plane crash on the way to his destination . 
  but imagine if you were the queen and it was all about you, 
  austro-hungarian *, 
  it 's just a prank , bro, 
  or [ this ] ( http://www.apartmani-zadar-pag.com/images/zadar-pag/pag/images/pg21.jpg ) table cloth from the island of pag, 
  1st of may falls on a weekend again this year ?!, 
  :( yeah , no day off, 
  not really . 
  bruxelles is the capital of the eu and many eu-wide decisions are made in bruxelles , so it does n't matter if you 're from the east or the west . 
  yesterday was declared a day of mourning in croatia , for example . 
  it ' very sad what people are capable of doing to other people . 
  same for croatia . 
  if it 's a car accident , a tourist lost in the mountains or if we see a boat sailing in the most dangerous weather , we assume it 's czechs ( or slovaks ) . 
  but it 's just jokes towards other slavs , a part of them coming probably from our subconscious feeling that we 're the only slavs who know how to handle hot climate and sea . 
  czechs and other slavs are our favourite tourists . 
  anyway , if you change your mind and visit croatia , you should try some of our ` alkoholna pi\u0107a ' . 
  no , it 's not what it looks like , it 's different meaning over here . 
  yeah , but we do n't have that many stereotypes for germans as we do for czechs . 
  do you have a link ? 
  i 've seen many czechs and the most common stereotype is that they wear sandals with socks on . 
  well , officially it 's ` zagrep\u010danin ' , but as a ` purger ' myself i also like ` zagrep\u010danec ' more, 
  what about their croatian and bosniak neighbours ? 
  no , i indeed used it as an inspiration, 
  she is the queen of croatia, 
  also , not that illogical , but very confusing : resident of novska - n\u00f3vljanin resident of novi vinodolski - n\u00f2vljanin resident of novalja - novaljac, 
  some of the irregular ones have the most common ending in croatia/serbia , which is ' - nin ' . 
  so are you . 
  how would you otherwise explain the incredible fertility of czech women ? 
  [ serbia pls ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etego2e9at8 ), 
  it 's obvious that the radical groups had a distinct long-term plan, 
  in croatia that 's simply ' ... , ne ? ', 
  because neutrogena, 
  i 've been to rome , lisbon and dubrovnik . 
  dubrovnik and rome are crowded during summer but definitely less in september than in july and august . 
  rome is huge and there are plenty of things to see , but it 's not really a place to relax , everyone is in a hurry and there are lots of ` sellers ' following you around and begging you to buy flowers/sunglasses ... 
  i would also suggest visiting pompeii which is 2 hours from rome . 
  lisbon is beautiful in september , very relaxing . 
  porto even more . 
  dubrovnik is crowded in the summer but it 's not difficult to walk through the city , only around the city walls . 
  it 's fairly small so there is not much to see in more than 2 days , unless you are also going to some of the islands or continuing to other nearby cities . 
  sorry , edited . 
  let it be . 
  he is happy in his own world, 
  we also have ' a ne ' which is also a sarcastic yes, 
  i agree that czech republic has the best pan-slavic flag , i would also add russia and slovenia , i like the white-blue-red pattern order . 
  croatia and serbia are a disgrace . 
  so 6000000 jews were killed because they were not socialist ? 
  or because they were not tall and blond ? 
   seriously how serious can the injuries be ? 
  but still . . 
  i think the positions of the present day far-right parties are pretty clear . 
  nazis were ** national ** - socialists . 
  the word ` national ' is the key word . 
  so it 's basically like annus and anus, 
  what is the country that nods for no ? 
  do n't mind them , they 're crazy . 
  they use the same word for ` year ' . 
  so 2 anuses ago i was in italia, 
  i do n't think slovenians use ` ja\u0161ta ' , that 's more a bosnian thing, 
  i think it means anus in their language, 
  in bosnia , too, 
  the only thing i 'm afraid about the refugees is the rise of the far-right parties in europe . 
  no one can harm us as we can harm ourselves , and we simply refuse to learn from the past ... 
  do you even english ? 
  like , wtf is that supposed to mean ?!, 
  you russians really ca n't speak english ... 
  lol , me\u0111ugorje is the most successful fraud ever, 
  shut up belarus, 
  and montenegro today earns money by advertising budva with photos of dubrovnik . 
  is n't that adorable ? 
  * triggered *, 
  ew , walk ? 
  hint : say dubrovnik is serbian, 
  nope . 
  you 'll have to try harder . 
  we 're not difficult to trigger , though . 
   did i trigger a croat already ? 
  why ? 
  education \u2260 intellect, 
  oh , that old bearded guy wearing a 50cm crown on his head ? 
  is he an intellectual or something ? 
  [ absolutely !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7m89erbidi ), 
  [ we respond ] ( https://youtu.be/cubcp2wgkyw?t=106 ), 
  [ full of life !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxwo6l5cfcw ), 
   serbia and montenegro are closer to macedonia so ** possibly ** they understand macedonian much better i assumed that there might be a dialect of serbian or montenegrin that is close to macedonian , i did n't say that there is one, 
  yeah , but i speak kajkavian croatian which is very similar to slovenian , so i understand slovenian perfectly . 
  i thought that there are perhaps serbians and montenegrins who have a dialect similar to macedonian .
