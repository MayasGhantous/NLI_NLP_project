  yes , but that was more than two decades ago . 
  also , two left-centre governments ago . 
  no one has the courage . 
  we are the only country that signed contracts with vatican , which are against the constitution of a secular country and they give the catholic church a privileged position . 
  so croatia is practically not a secular country . 
  for example , they state that the country must organize religion classes in schools . 
  we 're proud of the design , but we would like it to be on larger planes . 
  this could actually win the eurovision unlike the song you chose . 
  if you are confused by his inappropriate answer , you should be warned that he is a known troll on r/slovenia , r/croatia and r/askeurope . 
  he uses multiple accounts as he regularly ends up banned . 
  i think it might be because most of istria is missing on this map . 
  omg that 's a wonderful name, 
  professional polls are made by specifically choosing people of different age/sex/class / residence/education . . , in order to get a representative sample . 
  that 's why a professionally done poll with a sample of 1.000 people is more accurate than a random online poll with 50.000 people . 
   slovakian to me as a croatian/czech speaking literally sound like you got a croat in his 40 to learn czech . 
  it has the croatian pronunciation yet it 's czech words . 
  [ like this ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyzk0sio2vu ) :d, 
  sorry , lol . 
  we call you like that , too . 
  same like it 's not croatians but croats . 
  but then it 's completely ok to use both slovenians and slovenes . 
  i do n't understand this . 
  i know slovakian is the next closest language to us outside of the south slavic group , but how can it be on the same distance as slovenian ? 
  i understand slovenian quite well , slovakian - not so much . 
  i do n't think you get the joke  hint : montenegrins are stereotypically very lazy, 
  they are an important part of the traditional cuisine in the mediterranean areas of the country . 
  however , that 's only a narrow coastal part of croatia . 
  now that people in those areas can afford meat , we are at the bottom of the list of european fish consumers . 
  god is merciful towards the poles . 
  the rest of v4 and lithuania are much more atheist than poland . 
  we are the top wine drinkers after vatican and andorra , but still nothing . . 
  i think we 'll have to try that thing called fish . 
  i thought they joined europe now . . 
   they are usually high standing with current party leadership ( either because of their personal connections or ideology ) yep , barisic is the president of the croatian branch of the paneuropean union , while the pm and deputy pm are members of the presidency . 
  when will you stop living in the past ? 
  your name is crna legija ( black legion ) : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_legion_ ( usta % c5 % a1e_militia )  you can read this guy 's publication list here : http://www.pavobarisic.eu/en/selected-publications yeah , no thanks . 
  i 'll rather read the original authors , the ones barisic stole from . 
  like stephen schlesinger . 
   i mean that 's like saying `` according to pyongyang 99 % of the people think kim is the greatest '' yeah , i do n't see any similarities ... 
  silent or not , the majority of croats are for further integration , according to eurostat . 
  i was not complaining , i think it would be stupid if our politicians acted like rebels . 
  what made him do that ? 
  in an interview he gave when he was in sarajevo he said he was concerned about the rise of nationalism in europe . 
  he seemed like a normal , centre to centre-right , not someone who would appreciate far-righters in any way . 
   it 's an anti-immigration , anti-federalist bloc in the eu . 
  what ? 
  no , it 's not . 
  it 's an initiative to reduce dependency of eastern europe on russian energy and to induce infrastructure development and better connection overall between eastern european countries . 
  it has nothing to do with anti-immigrants and anti-federalism , otherwise slovenian president borut pahor , an open eu federalist , would have never been a part of it . 
  btw , our president also leans towards eu federalism with her public statements about the eu , despite the fact she never openly supported it . 
  same , hofer is just a populist who changes opinions as the wind blows . 
  it rarely happens that we do n't like something mama merkel says , at least when it comes to all of our politicians in croatia . 
  his head certainly has been under some sort of pressure . 
  he also claims that kolinda is a member of the illuminati and that owner of jutarnji sold his soul to the devil . 
  awkward time zone in astana , lack of interest, 
  they are back in ** for ** now . 
  their senator is amy ** klobuchar ** , could be croatian, 
   whats ** your ** favourite song in your native language ? 
  toni leskovar - [ serbus zagreb ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqmolaofplm ), 
  i like precision, 
  well serbia and poland are in cet, 
  why specifically those countries ? 
  congrats to new now !, 
  a beautiful successor of river 2020 . 
   when claiming independence with historical borders no , not historical borders . 
  the ** constitutional ** borders . 
  nope , sr croatia was a federal state of yugoslavia ( which did n't accept sr croatia 's '' fundamental human right of self-determination '' ) . 
  sr croatia 's borders were in the constitution of yugoslavia . 
  nope , sr croatia did n't invent anything . 
  just tried to secede . 
  we did n't invent our territory . 
  it was in the constitution of yugoslavia . 
   und sie sind sehr sch\u00f6n is that how you translate ... nevermind . . 
  [ this thread is exactly what we need right now ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ttt6nos.jpg ), 
  [ tal vez tenga algo que ver con esto ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/54o51j/hello/ ), 
  we protected the king , i do n't know much else about the subject, 
  i think he 's speaking about [ klis fortress ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mongol_invasion_of_europe#invasion_of_the_kingdom_of_croatia ) ( a.k.a. 
  the free city of meereen ), 
  yes , they all look like somewhat normal people , but now we have to hope that they are competent . 
  wait !, 
  kolinda promised we 're going to be among the richest countries in the world !, 
  for example , the leader of sdp mentioned multiple times during the campaign that his grandfather was an usta\u0161a ( nazi ) , without anyone asking him , in order to get some voters from the right . 
  his disappointed voters stayed at home and there is no possibility for a right-winger to vote for sdp - so he failed horribly . 
  and these were the elections he was supposed to win with a big margin lol . 
  it 's difficult to say since the government has n't been formed yet , no one has enough seats to form it so now the negotiations are in the process . 
  the big coalition sdp-hdz is still not completely ruled out as an option , but most likely it will be hdz and most + the minorities . 
  i hope it will last longer , but we never know . . 
  yes , that , too . 
  and sanader and 8 years of his corrupt government . 
  hopefully things like that are gone now , these elections it was only one side talking about ww2 and his rhetoric turned out to be an epic fail . 
  but even with all that , our economy was not very diverse , so crisis had a very strong impact . 
  2008 hit hard, 
  it 's actually not doing that bad now , we are currently having growths higher than expected . 
  but it 's frustrating since we used to have higher ppp than most of the post communist countries and now they are overtaking us one by one . 
  that 's what we said for slovakia . 
  and estonia . 
  and lithuania . 
  and latvia . 
  and poland .
