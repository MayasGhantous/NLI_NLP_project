i 'm not sure , but a guy in the comments on this video says he thinks it 's from `` the nearly complete and utter history of everything '' http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gytglthz8ao, 
  i like how they all have such a casual facial expressions . 
  stabbing , butchering , killing ... oh well , just another day at the job . 
   my only guess is that they 're pretty patriotic . 
  why do you assume that this has to be in opposition to each other . 
  this map is very deceiving because it presumes that everyone assumed the same thing under `` europe '' . 
  i can assure you that croatian society is still `` pretty patriotic '' and that overwhelming majority of those saying they `` feel european '' does not put their european identity higher than croatian one . 
  in fact , i 'll dare say that if you asked them to rate the significance of their identities ( national , regional , supranational etc ) european one would be at the bottom . 
  i think we would find out a lot more if the survey included a question to rate the significance of `` europeness '' . 
  is that ... really him ? 
  or just a look-alike ? 
  you are not the only one . 
  probably : [ tko pjeva , zlo ne misli ] ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066461/ ), 
   jennifer is our commitment to these ideas let 's oppose ah yes , google translate never disappoints . 
  croatian , istrian and that 's about it . 
  european ? 
  well maybe in a sense that croatia happens to be in europe , but it is in no way part of my identity . 
  ouch !, 
  i mean seriously , ouch !, 
  i always liked you latvia , not so much any more . 
  how ? 
  as far as i 'm aware you have no aircraft carriers , equipped for launching jet fighters , currently in comission . 
  every croatian dies a little inside each times he/she hears this song . 
  i 'm pretty sure it was in 1996 , after dayton and agreements on peaceful integration of eastern slavonia . 
  well , i was born in 1990 so it 's no wonder it escaped me . 
  but that is still over a decade of my life ( that i have more or less consistent memory of ) during which i did n't encounter a bar ( or any kind of legal/illegal establishment ) with that names . 
   `` danke deutschland '' and '' [ 1 ] genscher '' i do not remember seeing a bar with any of those two names in my life . 
  at least you are on the other side of europe . 
  i live about half an hour from hungarian border and it 's the first time i 've heard about his too . 
  which is kind of concerning since i regularly follow major croatian newspapers and news portals and i do n't remember reading anything that would hint anything similar to this . 
  if what it says in this article is true than my greatest reason for fear is how easy this managed to pass bellow public radar . 
  i do n't remember croatia being in the eu . 
  their original name was `` aliance for change '' . 
  `` kukuriku '' was the name of the reastaurant where they gathered and reached an agreement on the coallition . 
  `` kukuriku coallition '' appeared as a mock name in the press but they ( kukuriku ) accepted it as their official name . 
  all this , of course , does n't make it less silly :d, 
   the crown prince of austria was killed at ** serajevo ** ** serbia ** til franz ferdinand was not killed in sarajevo , bosnia in au monarchy but in a town called serajevo in serbia . 
  lmao, 
  just a few issues i have with this article :  yet one rising star of croatian politics ... natasha srdoc , founder and chair of the adriatic institute for public policy ( ai ) she is a political anonymus with no significance . 
  this article is in fact first time i 've ever heard of her  in addition to new laws mandating transparency , srdoc wants to prosecute all politicians , past and present , who have amassed unexplained wealth . 
  she 'd seize misappropriated amounts that reportedly total multiple billions and use the money to help pay down croatia 's debt . 
  no wonder she 's been stigmatized as `` an enemy of the state '' by the ruling croatian democratic union ( hdz ) or that she and her family have been threatened . 
  i do n't know if she and her family have been threatened but that `` enemy of the state '' part is plainely ridiculous . 
  same things are being repeated regurlarely for the past several years by numerous journalists and politicians , nothing new . 
   whatever their actual source , those threats are not likely idle . 
  among other deadly incidents , media publisher and regime critic ivo pukanic died in a 2008 car bomb explosion in zagreb . 
  six men were convicted in what was vaguely depicted in the media as an organized crime hit . 
  i 'm unsure but it seems to me that they are trying to imply this was government sponsored murder . 
  ( which is rather bold claim , aspecially without any evidencce or indication for sich an act )  the socialist sdp party already supports recourse to the imf . ), 
  ** s ** ocial ** d ** emocratic ** p ** arty of croatia - social-democrats are not the same thing as socialists ( though having in mind that us americans actualy have a serious debate over wether obama is a socialist or not this is not so surprising ) , and they do not support the imf . 
   according to srdoc , ti croatia receives funding from the state-owned electrical company hep , which itself came under corruption charges , and from croatia 's ministry of foreign affairs . 
  ... and european commission , norwegian ministry of foreign affairs , national foundation for civil society , national foundation for civil society development , transparency international secretariat , berlin - german foreign ministry former donors include : embassy of the united states of america in zagreb , balkan trust for democracy , embassy of the kingdom of the netherlands , in zagreb , european commission , ipa 2008 programme , holcim d.o.o. , royal norwegian embassy in zagreb , embassy of finland in zagreb , city od zagreb , city od rijeka , office for human rights of the government of the republic of croatia , academy for educational development , aba ceeli , oecd , usaid , open society institute croatia . 
  [ source ] ( http://www.transparency.hr/index.php?lang=en )  if nations like croatia play a larger role on the international stage without stepped-up anticorruption initiatives , that balance will be strained beyond endurance . 
  i seriously doubt croatia is/is going to be even remotely significant as the author of the article is trying to suggest this article is shamefully obvious ( paid ? ), 
  ad for this natasha srdoc and has no journalistic value what so ever . 
  someone is trying to promote their own candidate on the upcoming elections . 
   edit : then again they said `` kosor lost to stipe mesic , a social democrat , in 2010 presidential elections . '', 
  it seems proofreading is a lost art . 
  not to mention that mesi\u0107 somehow became a social democrat . 
   to contact the reporter on this story : jasmina kuzmanovic in zagreb at jkuzmanovic@bloomberg.net i somehow find it more troubling that the reporter is apparently from croatia !, 
   kosor , who will face voters on dec. 4 in ** early elections ** there is nothing early about this elections, 
  well , i did n't say it was made by slovenians . 
  are you sure ? 
  this seems a lot like slovenian pov , especially with that piran part . 
  in that case i 'll stop saying `` croatia '' and start saying only `` hrvatska '', 
   that we 're somewhere in africa roflmao !!!, 
  well , when i was in malta almost every time i said i was from croatia the answer was : `` russia ? '', 
  followed by a confused look on the face . 
  milo\u0161evi\u0107 did n't commit suicide , he died of natural causes . 
  whether or not the language we speak is the same with multiple standards or two different languages is , in reality , mostly political decision . 
  i 'm not a linguist so i ca n't expert opinion on this . 
  however the reason for this situation we have right now is that paradigm language = = nation is still prevalent over any other . 
  that is why ( failed ) attempt of making unified `` serbo-croatian '' standard was made . 
  in reality , however , there were always two standards ( if you count bih and monte negro probably even more ) . 
  all you have to do is to take two books published in ex-yu : that one which was published in croatia is written in croatian standard and one which was published in serbia in serbian , even though the language was `` serbo-croatian '' in both cases . 
  the fact is , however , that conciousness about particular identity does n't depend on the language , not if we talk about a nation in a modern sense . 
  that is why even if linguists became united in their assessment that it is the same language , national identities would not be blurred . 
   to get ripped off by the germans they can try . 
  however we are ready to take their jobs . 
  in fact we have already infiltrated all levels of german society and we are advancing job by job , our numbers are getting bigger and bigger each day until finally , one day , all germans will be jobless or working for poor wages . 
  because we are many and we take jobs . 
   spied on by the french , and forever held in contempt by the british . 
  so , business as usual . 
   for individuals or for the general population it is no bad thing to have the government accountable to another organisation . 
  yeah i guess that is a good thing . 
  one of the main things that irritates , me and many other people , is that primarily no one knows what are the terms our government agreed in the process of negotiations . 
  it is , in the words of the prominent government official , `` known to those people that need to know '' . 
  secondly , whenever they talk about importance of entering eu , prime minister and her underlings , represent this as some kind of magical wand which will make all problems disappear . 
  this , of course , makes people highly suspicious about the very idea of eu . 
  they have enough mental capacity to figure out when someone is trying to sell them fairy tales under the guise of reality . 
  exactly . 
   that you have some issues with them , those issues are purely political . 
  nothing to do with relationship between common people besides usual rivalry between neighbours , of course . 
   but do you really think that in a situation like this they ... 
  i honestly do n't know what to think . 
  i only know there is little i can do to influence things . 
  update : i do however think referendum should be held because it is important that we as a people decide about something . 
  i am however pretty certain that choosing not to enter would be more reasonable thing to do than declining the accession . 
   governments only ever seem to call referenda when either they are forced to by law or when they have a very good idea that they will get the result they want . 
  true .
