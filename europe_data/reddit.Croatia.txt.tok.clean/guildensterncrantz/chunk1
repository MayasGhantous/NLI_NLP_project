so ... assad is actually an idiot that went full retard ? 
  i mean , i hear you , and i hear / u/corvettetaa . 
  it 's just that any leader being so unbelievably * stupid * pushes my suspension of disbelief . 
  and especially a leader that has had open warfare in his country for 6 years , rebels and isil included , and is now involving russia 's help - sure russia * could * help him , a lot probably , but if they went against usa/the rest of the world , i 'm doubtful - even their economy is nowadays pressured because of crimea . 
  i somehow doubt they 'll insist if push came to shove , not over an already-damaged country like syria . 
  you have that old `` motive , means , opportunity '' thing . 
  i can see the means and opportunity , but i ca n't wrap my head around the motive . 
  i mean this is full `` too dumb to tie my shoelaces '' stupid . 
  in case i 'm not missing some joke about south-west austria ~ yea , while people usually think `` kangaroos , barrier reef , desolation , everything is trying to kill you '' when you ask them about australia , at least the desolation bit is not telling the whole story . 
  sure the outback is huge , but here : the [ climate map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d7/australia-climate-map_mjc01_1.svg/1024px-australia-climate-map_mjc01_1.svg.png ) and the [ water map . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/reliefmap_of_australia.png ), 
  i thought it was good/ok-ish . 
  not in my list of top 50 , but not something i regret watching . 
  it starts with a funny message , how during wwii the world may have been falling apart , but your regular teenager from some small town in italy had * bigger priorities * ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  familija here too , but it 's more colloquial . 
  though unlike many of the `` official proper language '' words , obitelj is pretty commonly used on the street . 
  depends on when and where you go . 
  i think it 's like the paris or venice syndrome , everybody wants to visit those , and in the worst of the peak season too . 
  dubrovnik and plitvice are the biggest culprits over here ( i mean i actually saw two koreans on a * rowboat * in plitvice , he was rowing , she was giggling into a selfie-stick . 
  that 's how bad the selfie-sticks got . ), 
  basically - you should avoid middle of july -  middle of august ( early september is best ) . 
  avoid weekends for the biggest tourist attractions . 
  walls of dubrovnik , start in early morning ( helps with the heat too ) , early afternoon is worst . 
  renting a car is best if you want to see towns/villages/countryside outside of tourist traps . 
  if not a car , there 's plenty of buses that go everywhere , prices are fairly cheap by west-euro standards . 
  research less-known paths before coming , 
   most of the eastern block became democracies overnight . 
  ehh . 
  as far as i know , most of the eastern block had some really shit times in turning from communism to capitalism , the communist pigdogs just privatized everything and became capitalist pigdogs , same corruption and white-collar robbery continued , but this time with more freedom of speech and fewer rights for workers , yay . 
  and so many of the industries fell apart , we turned from an industrial republic into a zimmer frei republic ( come to our coast and spend euromonies , pls ) . 
  and that 's not even going into the facts like : yugoslavia had a war , the russian changes resulted in bread lines and then putin , and fwiw at least over here you had the choice between more or less bad , which does n't seem to hold for syria . 
  i do n't know . 
  i think there 's only so much outsiders can help if the country they 're trying to help ca n't - or wo n't - help itself . 
  these sort of massive changes have to come mostly from the inside . 
  well yes , it 's cold . 
  but what 3rd option ? 
  there do n't seem to be any good options among the rebels . 
  the west literally colonizes syria ? 
  c'mon , as if that ever worked before , or as if eu or usa would even be interested in taking care of syria for the next several decades , when we have our own problems . 
  i mean if syria figures out a good not-assad option , i 'm all for it . 
  but it 's been 6 years of brutal civil war ( and an attempted revolution before that ... ) and still nothing . 
  pardon my confusion , but is n't the only thing `` known '' where the planes went from ? 
  which is assad 's base . 
  but it is n't proven where the * chemical * bit came from ? 
  for all i know it might have happened that the rebels had a stockpile on the ground ( are n't they known for using chemicals , anyways ? 
  ) , assad 's folk dropped some usual bombs , the chemicals went up basically on accident . 
  it 's still unacceptable that such < accidents  can happen , but it 's better than pre-meditated civilian murder . 
  at least that 'd explain the story better than assad going full retard - he may be a monster , but i do n't think he 's a * stupid * monster that 'd intentionally turn most of the world against himself in a time when he seriously needs either support or at least neutrality . 
  one of the main leave arguments was the immigrants . 
  what ends up happening does n't have a lot to do with the motivation , same goes for that lying nhs bus and so on . 
  ( iirc even the polls show that immigration is one of the most important concerns of the voters . ), 
  isolationism - again , the argument went `` more sovereignty , those dictators in brussels wo n't be telling us what to do . '', 
  so that 's literally more isolation , being the sole commander of your own ship . 
  also , in trade , whatever deals are made with eu , they 'll be less open than what uk had while in eu ( which is the main point of the eu ) . 
  and iirc the majority of the uk trade is with eu , presumably because eu is rich and * close * , unlike the rest of commonwealth , so we 'll see if the new deals with commonwealth can even out the loss . 
   the eu , the uk and the us are part of the west correction : the eu , uk , canada & co say `` how high '' when usa says `` jump ! '', 
  meaning , `` the west '' is usa and its * followers * ( when it 's a good thing and when it 's a bad thing ) . 
  eu * could * become less of a follower and more of an equal teammate in this so-called `` west '' , separate countries that are n't usa less so . 
  in fact i 'd argue that europe is already closer to being equal than it was post-wwii , when the west europe was saying `` yes , yes '' to usa so that usa protects them from ussr . 
  ( the east europe was literally under ussr 's boot , and it was n't pretty . 
  so much for independent european countries ' wishes being relevant . ), 
  as for the other organizations you mention ... imf and wto have all/most of the world as members . 
  g7 ... there 's japan and canada in there , and they do n't affect my life much . 
  i 'll grant you the un security council , you 're a permanent member there , but un is basically useless for all security , so i do n't know how much that counts . 
  ( this is a rather big comment with many generalizations ... trying to put as much of the big picture in short-ish words . 
  hope it makes sense . ), 
  ---------------------------- perhaps the confusion comes from the attitude . 
  brits may not want their empire back , but the * perception * is that they still act as if they 're somehow better or stronger as a country than the mainland european countries , as if they can afford to act in a way an empire acts . 
  it 's the extra `` stiff upper lip '' , you know ? 
  and while afaik most people see themselves as `` country first '' , `` eu second '' , `` europe third '' ( or perhaps the 2nd and 3rd are reversed ) , uk seems to be less invested than most of the mainland . 
  which to be fair , you have the size of the economy , the army , and the channel as logical explanations ( `` do n't forget you 're going to an island '' ) . 
  but imo the sovereignty issue is rather ... old fashioned , with dashes of * naive * . 
  sovereign states may have worked in the past ( or actually no , they did n't , the past was a time of empires and countries constantly at war , constantly abusing their colonies ) . 
  but isolationism - which brexit is - does n't work in the increasingly global world , in terms of trade if nothing else . 
  then in a political sense , the world has n't advanced enough for peaceful and true independence of countries . 
  you have the leaders ( the big fish , ala usa , increasingly china , eu could be it if it bothered ) , the followers ( the yes men , it 's assumed that they have enough to offer to the players ) , the irrelevant ( shit countries that nobody cares about ) , and the last - the neutral/independent who find an useful but * very narrow * niche ( the swiss keeping all our money safe ) . 
  uk is leaving the eu . 
  because sovereignty ? 
  less immigration ( = more isolation ) ? 
  does n't want to be a part of a potential leader ? 
  the trade at least seems a strange argument , commonwealth is mostly oceans away , unlike the rest of europe . 
  i mean ... good luck with that , if it ends up making sense/being a good thing . 
  hmm . 
  afaik ours comes more from the german minorities that lived all over the danube river valley - in this case , hungary , serbia , croatia , romania . 
  [ the danube swabians . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/danube_swabians ) sadly , they were mostly expelled after wwii : < the name stuck around to mean `` germans in general '' , though . 
  in any case , at least over here the name does n't have any negative undertones that i noticed . 
  at worst it 's un-serious as i said , for example if you 're telling some joke about the germans , you 'll use \u0160vabe instead of nijemci , 
  could be the obligatory / new queue downvote ? 
  or a `` i do n't like these fads/spam '' downvote . 
  both of those can turn around in the first vital hour ... godspeed , and here 's an upboat for you , 
  '' \u0160vabe '' here as well . 
  though it 's mostly used colloquially , in un-serious situations . 
  `` nijemci '' are the people in the eu parliament . 
  '' \u0160vabe '' are [ the people who ~ ~ anschluss ~ ~ reserve the beach overnight with towels up to the point it drives you ballistic ;d ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4v2cpk/angry_croatian_locals_burn_towels_left_on_a_beach/ ),

  on this pic the brightest cities `` on the other side of adriatic '' are zagreb , belgrade and budapest ( top of the triangle here ) . 
  with the exception of 2022 - * if only * :o or at least , that 's what the government , their godmother , and all of their godmother 's 3rd cousins from imotski probably fantasized about when entering . 
  then it turned out they 're not competent enough at inventing fictional workplaces to hire all those 3rd cousins ( which is rather sad , like losing at the special olympics ) , bloody hell even the godmother herself is feeling endangered nowadays .
