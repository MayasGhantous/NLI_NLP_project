  and while presumably this also benefits the poles - they get more convenient products - it 's bad once whole factories start shutting down and they lose their jobs . 
  ( made in china is another case of this . ), 
  ok , his wording in the end was unfortunate - the compensation bit . 
  but he * may * have a point ? 
  it depends , how much money did the rest of eu make selling stuff in poland , vs how much money it would have made if poland was n't in eu ? 
  if germany alone made 55 billion , obviously the total amount from the whole of eu will be larger than the 80 billion that was paid into poland . 
  so we 'd need to see how much of that total-sales-number would have been present if poland did n't seriously raise its ppp with the help of eu funds . 
  you ca n't sell anything to people who are dirt poor . 
  i suspect that it 'd turn out that once you crunch all the numbers , poland is a net gain to eu . 
   switzerland is doing fine . 
  norway , too . 
  alright , i 'm not that informed on norway in general , so i 'll refrain from talking much about it . 
  ( i do know that they 're way up in the north , away from lanes where tanks usually roll , and also they have oil money . ), 
  switzerland is the exception , not the rule in europe . 
  they 've been neutral for centuries , and you can only stay neutral if other countries let you do it ( or you can somehow defend yourself ) . 
  for reference , ask * belgium * how being `` neutral '' suited them in wwii , and there you 'll see the experience that 's more similar to your average mainland european country . 
  switzerland is also in the middle of the bloody * alps * , which means attacking them has more cost than gain . 
  now of course they were * clever * to make themselves the neutral bank for the rest , but that probably never could have happened if their terrain/geographical position was similar to poland/germany/balkans / etc. 
  mind you , uk has the nifty position of being an island chain , so fine , a lot of that danger of staying `` neutral '' ( they do n't , anyways ) is nullified . 
  and outside of war , an organization speaking with 500 million voices is stronger than the one speaking with 60 million . 
  less easy for the bigger powers to push you around in politics/economy/whatever . 
   what you do n't seem to get is that people we frustrated not with the red-tape but the excessive tape . 
  but i 've linked the map ... ? 
  it 's from [ here ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index#ranking ) ( sources for that study are in the `` citatation '' ) . 
  it 's not a perfect correlation , but ease of doing business is usually negatively impacted by excessive/incompetent red tape . 
  it was n't the `` ease of doing business in uk '' that choked uk 's economy . 
   it was n't that unskilled immigrants stole jobs , it 's that they drive wages down . 
  wait a moment . 
  does n't your government ensure some minimum wage ... ? 
  over here , if it was n't for that , i honestly believe our capitalist pigdogs would pay you with fairy dust and good wishes . 
  as for the unemployed native in general , we 've had a rise in that too , but i may as well cry about the chinese out-competing us with their big industry and cheap labor . 
  that 's the fault of capitalism/globalism , hell also the robots are taking away those slob-jobs you 're talking about . 
  not the eu 's fault our industry started dying in 90 's . _ . 
  side-note , redditor / u/scutters , this first looked like 2 redditors talking to each other , then one scutters talking to him/herself , the finally an edit . 
  ( one comment seemed to say that the referendum was binding in practice , the other that * technically * westminister could have ignored it anyways . 
  freaky moment there ! ), 
   no feeling of anger or relief is factually justified . 
  i 'm not entirely with you . 
  yes , i agree that we should feel sad , and i 'm against feeling relieved ( this is a loss ) , or spiteful or anything like that . 
  but i think anger is natural here . 
  yes , of course they contributed more money than they got back , but it 's not like eu is all about money here - it should be clear to everyone that `` every joe for himself '' mentality of the past does n't work anymore , european countries by themselves are far too small for the world , even the biggest/strongest of them . 
  then the arguments for brexit were odd ... 
  i can get people being frustrated with eu 's inability to act fast/together , but the solution for that is more federalization , which uk does n't want . 
  then just today i saw some article celebrating how uk will be `` rid off all that eu red-tape choking the economy '' , [ meanwhile uk is one of the least red-tape countries in the world . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bu6ylqj.png ) then they were n't part of schengen or eurozone , and they had no obligation to join . 
  when it comes to `` nasty immigrants stealing our jobs '' , a ) uk was one of the rare countries that usually did n't put those caps on eu immigration ( up to 7 years iirc ) , and b ) if some immigrant that probably [ does n't speak your language or at least does n't speak it as well as you do , does n't know how your country functions , also probably does n't even know anyone ] can get the job in * your country * easier than you can , dude ... something is broken there , and it 's not the immigrant . 
  and they basically rage-quit . 
  i mean ... fine . 
  wish them all the luck . 
  also when i was driving though bosnia in 2013 , i ran into konzum . 
  `` dear lord , it 's metastasizing !, 
  perhaps it reflects germany during the tourist season ? 
  seriously , so many germans everywhere , makes you wonder if there 's anyone keeping the fort at home ... 
  right , that 's why i said not solar/hydro . 
  pity about the wind , though . 
  aside from rotterdam making sea difficult ( ? 
  ) , how about those off-shore turbines ? 
  like for example what estonia/denmark ( iirc ) are building . 
  would that be feasible ? 
  can someone tl ; dr what 's going on with netherlands ? 
  i can guess that you have less potential for let 's say solar ( or hydro , but not all of them count as renewable ) , but - if you ask any kid to picture netherlands , they 'll say `` windmills '' . 
  [ what happened ? 
  ] ( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/images/thumb/6/6c/share_of_renewables_in_gross_final_energy_consumption%2c_2014_and_2020_%28%25%29_yb16.png/800px-share_of_renewables_in_gross_final_energy_consumption%2c_2014_and_2020_%28%25%29_yb16.png ), 
  no but seriously , so the article mentions trump and thatcher as idols ( to hear some brits talk , thatcher was a shade more popular than satan himself ) , and talks about the ... uk 's desire ... to kill newts and have incandescent bulbs ? 
  [ when uk is one of the least red-tape countries on earth ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index#ranking ) oh deer lord i wonder , do they imagine british workers manufacturing incandescent lightbulbs while working `` de-regulated '' hours ? 
  why not go back to petroleum lamps , while they 're at it . 
   we are the clays that say  `` gib ! '', 
  but how would the rising price of oil help your average russian , if all the oil has been stolen by the `` fine capitalists '' ? 
  they do n't share with the commons . 
  the problems of rising russian oligarchy were well known ~ ~ that ~ ~ at the time . 
  tbh russia still has them , but the perception is that putin put a brake on their looting . 
  look at the stats , `` the depression of the economy led to the collapse of social services ; the birth rate plummeted while the death rate skyrocketed . 
  millions plunged into poverty , from a level of 1.5 % in the late soviet era to 39 -- 49 % by mid-1993 . '', 
  this sharp rise in poverty - and the subsequent recovery after putin came to power - ca n't be explained by the change in oil prices alone . 
  that 's the rub . 
  should russia consider eu/nato as their enemy ? 
  eu at the very least , has all those eastern countries joining or wanting to join , mostly because they see it as more valuable than joining russia . 
  and when you look at how bad the soviet-sponsored communism worked in these eastern countries ( and the problems still existing in russia atm ) , it 's no surprise to anyone , including russians . 
  and the notion of russia itself joining eu is just silly , they 're far too large in both population and geographic size - russia to me was always part-europe , part a world for itself ( bloody hell it 's larger than some continents ) . 
  nato ... ehhh . 
  it 's clear to everyone that it 's mostly funded and led by usa , and usa and russia seem to have this perpetual rage-boner for each other . 
  so fair enough . 
  the problem then mostly comes from eu usually saying `` yes , yes '' to whatever `` nato '' decides ( nato = usa , mostly ) . 
  they 're seen as one and the same , and i think we should consider questioning that . 
  tbh he was viewed fairly positively here too . 
  of course there were elements of shadiness around him from the beginning , but i remember being a kid and seeing russia in the news as hopelessly poor/messy , also insert < drunk yeltsin  not caring about any of that . 
  that was my impression , russia being this country that could be - and was - strong , but is drinking itself to a sad death because why not . 
  so putin turned that around ( with more or less success , depending on what you look at ) . 
  and he was n't that aggressive towards the west , at least in the earlier stages . 
  fast forward a dozen years , and he 's `` rescuing oppressed russian minorities '' , so much for world stability  . <, 
  hm i just looked up for us , [ id card alone is valid in georgia for croats . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_croatian_citizens#visa_requirements ) this id card thing , i think it may vary from country to country , when concerning non-eu or non-schengen ? 
  for example we 've had only-id with bosnia for a while now , iirc longer than we 've been in eu . 
  edit : so for netherlands -  georgia , it says `` no visa required '' , but does n't specify anything about id , so that probably means you need your passport . 
  lithuania on the other hand , `` id card valid '' . 
  mind you , this list may need updating now . 
  ahhh . . the wording confused me , too . 
  or maybe the map . 
  all the german flags initially made me think that `` so germany sells a ton of stuff to everyone , no surprise '' , but it 's the other way around here - `` germany * buys * a lot of stuff from everyone '' .
