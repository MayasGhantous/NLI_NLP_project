  it 's that embarrassing uncle bob you hide when other cool kids visit :d and as for the upvoted comments and the bigotry , look at the post itself . 
  with the exception of netherlands , should vlad go rescuing more `` oppressed russian minorities '' , estonia can count more on * canada of all places * , than on france/spain/germany , who are all part of the eu `` brotherhood and unity '' on top of being in nato . 
  that 's very telling , imho . 
  yep , at worst they 're rather overly enthusiastic , loud and friendly . 
  i end up feeling a bit * spiritually squished * . 
  but again , that just mostly makes them harmless . 
   i 'm guessing you do n't really see that much of a difference between the different countries of scandinavia or the benelux . 
  sweden is homogay , norway has oil , netherlands has weed , and belgium is the most fascinating country this side of bosnia ? 
  ;d no , but point taken , sometimes the details get very blurry . 
  i could tell you a lot about germany , portugal vs spain differences not so much . 
   also why do you think the dutch government is unfriendly/unfair ? 
  hmm . 
  there 's stuff like [ this ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_enlargement_of_the_european_union#/media/file:croatia_eu_freedom_of_movement.svg ) ... and iirc netherlands does that for more than just us . 
  similar goes for the ratification of our ascension . 
  then there 's the whole messy breakup of yugoslavia ~  germany advocated quick recognition of croatia , in order to stop ongoing violence in serb-inhabited areas , with helmut kohl requesting recognition in the bundestag on 4 september . 
  kohl 's position was opposed by france , the united kingdom , and the netherlands , but the countries agreed to pursue a common approach by following germany 's unilateral action . 
   ( ... ) germany 's position was supported by italy and denmark . 
  france and the uk attempted to prevent german recognition by drafting a united nations resolution requesting that no country take unilateral actions which could worsen the situation in yugoslavia . 
  and in general , whenever usa/germany/etc wanted to * intervene in time * during that war , i remember uk and france blocking that , iirc they were traditionally/historically serbia 's allies . 
  the kicker with that war is , for all that many outsiders tried to claim `` being neutral '' and `` staying out of it '' , the example of un 's weapons ' embargo meant that * only one side was properly armed , to obvious later effects * . 
  it 's a wonderful example of un somehow managing to be * worse * than useless . 
  so idk . 
  your political position in the last 25 + years is n't as directly hostile as uk 's , but well , it 's not exactly friendly either . 
  mind you , that dutch man i mentioned . 
  my uncle worked for his firm for some years , and the field was - de-mining . 
  so that 's good \\ ^ ^, 
  there 's pacifism , and then there 's srebrenica . 
  those two should not be confused . 
  invasion by russia is far too close to srebrenica . 
   i am also not insulting eastern europeans for wanting to defend themselfs , but they want others to die for them , which is n't something you can just demand . 
  that 's literally the whole point of nato . 
  you break that , everyone may as well leave nato and we 're back to year 45 ... or earlier . 
  the only reason we 've had mostly peace in europe since the end of wwii is those alliances . 
  oh , and leave the eu for that matter , what 's the point in being in an union that ca n't be arsed to defend its members from outright invasion ? 
  aaaaaand we 're back to the early 20th century , i doubt you 'll find that enjoyable , clever german redditor . 
   i do n't see a need to let germany being laid to waste , when we can get off the line with a cold war agreement . 
  the us did it to curb their casualties , so can germany and western europe . 
  i do n't see eastern european values align too much with western ones either , so there is n't even much of a basis there . 
  i see your values boil down to being a self-interested hypocrite expecting that the east works as your meat-shield . 
  you 're perfectly right , * we do n't share the same values . 
  maybe it 's cause yugoslavia was neutral ? 
  we 're `` western '' to you , and `` eastern '' to the west . 
  hell you even had sharp divisions through history , parts were with a-h/italy , parts with ottomans . 
  so we 're kinda schr\u00f6dinger 's in terms of geography/politics . 
  ( myself , i still sometimes get wistful about how tito exhorted moneyz from both sides . 
  `` i 'd be such a shame '' , he said , `` if usa/ussr built a base here . '' ), 
  ok , i said that we know that `` not all west is the same '' - and it 's not just the ireland/uk divide . 
  one of the examples would be this very post :d but in my interactions with almost all of western euros ( so examples like ireland not included ) , they 're either neutral , or they comment on the pretty touristic sights , or it 's [ like this . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/wdqayc1sr7g?t=22s ) and always the same stereotype for everyone east of the iron curtain , except greece ( and they have to `` pay denbts ! '' ) . 
  while the counter-example in this ( funny but has some truth in it ) video for `` how the east sees the west '' - ehhh . 
  not really , imo . 
  we ca n't even agree on whether nato is cool or awful with our closest neighbors , much less anything else . 
  i guess it 's because everyone here just was n't very relevant throughout history , except for russia , turkey and greece . 
  no need to take people out of their boxes when you 'll never interact with them ... though i think that should go away now that we 're in eu . 
  as for netherlands - i 've never been to your country , though i met a single dutch man many times ( he worked with my uncle ) . 
  the government , however - not that friendly . 
  we can unite around ranting about the western euros , d'oh !, 
  oh dear oh dear how have n't you heard that [ prepare for the glory that is eurovision !, 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zshc7idubcq ), 
  similar here . 
  we were with incarnations of austro-hungary for 800 years , coast was under venice for centuries too . 
  and you can literally see that with your own eyes , i go to budapest/prague/vienna and feel right at home . 
  same for coast being `` little italy '' . 
  then perhaps we should stop throwing europe into two boxes . 
  parties that are equivalent to farage/wilders/le pen are * nowhere close * to any decisions in my country , and i 'm `` so eastern yurop '' that i 'm literally balkan ( and what a dirty word that has become ) . 
  same for the west , you have such disparate examples like uk and ireland , whose foreign politics are more different than similar . 
  if you ask random people on the street here about their opinions on countries , they 'll tell you that uk is stuck up and xenophobic , meanwhile they 'll tell you that ireland is easy-going and friendly . 
  they certainly wo n't tell you that those two are the same . 
  which is not what happens with the east . 
  you get gross generalizations like `` balkans are politically unstable '' . 
  why ? 
  oh , some mess in macedonia ... which has literally nothing to do with me , and yet when i tell people i 'm from balkans , they 'll go `` ohhh , unstable '' . 
  or a worse example , `` romanians are gypsies '' . 
  as if the roma people have n't been present in all of europe for centuries , and as if they do n't have an unique culture that persists wherever they go ( so categorizing them as romanian roma/dutch roma/croatian roma/swedish roma etc etc is rather useless ) . 
  as for politics in general , or history , or those `` cultural stereotypes '' where one side is progressive and the other is n't , we could write whole books on that . 
  plot twist : many people in the east see the historical western imperialism ( cough , colonies ) as just as * barbarian * as for example the ottomans . 
  turks annexing our clay , venice annexing our clay , same shit different language . 
  in any case . 
  if you want to learn more about these divisions * from a different pov * , i had a rant about it [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/657x5f/a_strongly_worded_letter_to_the_western_europe/ ), 
  no , they do n't . 
  us eastern euros are 2nd class citizens according to the west , regardless of how much truth the west has to support that stereotype . 
  i mean tourists that come here , they get * surprised * by the richness of our history , and also you get ridiculous reactions like `` huh did n't know your motorways were good '' , it 's like they expected bloody congo . 
  also us being `` politically backward '' , the irony of the west being the one that 's threatening to break the eu escapes them . 
  people like le pen , wilders , and bloody nigel farage - we have rough equivalents to that . 
  the notion of them getting 30 % of the vote on our elections , or managing to shape our long-term politics ( like farage did ) is frankly absurd . 
  but we 're used to being 2nd class , and we have long since learn not to expect anything better from the west . 
  no expectations and therefore no disappointment here . 
  yep . 
  osijek , to be more specific \\ ^ ^, 
  a couple of more centuries , and you 'll either be nordic , or you 'll hit the atlantic or mediterranean coasts . 
  i suppose that you 'll more likely go for the latter two , all part of your cunning plan to get to warm water , is n't it !, 
  we 're onto you !, 
  [ this plane , obviously !, 
  ok , to tell them apart on a map : [ this is slovenia . 
  ] ( https://letsfeelslovenia.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/slovenia-totally-looks-like-a-running-chicken.jpg?w=640 ), 
  ... and poland prepares to migrate west ? 
  and seriously amuses me , considering that gramps was a partisan . 
  as i recall , that redditor 's ancestors did n't manage to get rid of the wehrmacht and their collaborators on their own , needed rescuing by usa . 
  how 's that for a plot twist ?
