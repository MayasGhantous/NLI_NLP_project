  here 's the thing : you need to look at the targeted audience . 
  youtube ? 
  toxic wasteland for all countries . 
  comment sections of political sites ? 
  again , consider what manner of people would be attracted to following our often cancerous political pissing matches and herp derp statements . 
  so you already have idiotic/triggered people from croatia , and then they meet equally idiotic/triggered people from serbia . 
  is it a wonder that disaster happens ? 
  meanwhile , most sane people have better things to do with their lives than following politics . 
  jobs , families , cat and flower pics to facebook/etc . 
  i 'd say that the crew you see here on r/europe and r/croatia is somewhere around 8-9/10 when it comes to progressive thinking ... while those toxic comment sections fall under 2/10 . 
  ( the 1/10 have n't found * internet sorcery * yet . ), 
  most of the population falls somewhere in the middle . 
  look . 
  i hardly tolerate that `` usta\u0161e il partizani '' from my own local bellends , i certainly have no patience for tolerating it from random dutch ( if that 's what he even is ) . 
  it 'd be the equivalent of me randomly shitting on the dutch for their colonies , or [ insert whatever empire ] for starting wars in europe every other tuesday throughout history . 
  as for people who tend to frequent t_d , they have shown , time and again , that they have nothing intelligent to say . 
  i met all of one exception so far , in my endless hours of redditing . 
  this is just the latest exhibit . 
  meh , you do n't get `` a vacation '' to goli otok today . 
  plus , our main national passtime is poo-flinging at the politicians and the capitalist moguls , in a measure that was absolutely inconceivable during commie times . 
  just look at hdz and exhibit a : index.hr . 
  that whole ( tbh annoying ) crew would have been sent to eternal pastures in juga . 
  so amusing meta-drama brought me to r/serbia a while back , where i ran into [ this hilarity . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/serbia/comments/5o3756/posle_18_godina_otvorena_linija_beogradsarajevo/ ) just for the dramatic popcorn-value , i almost wish they actually did that , the absolute madlads : '' d, 
  go back to making america great again !, 
  side-note : this is the first time i 'm seeing a trumpeter from netherlands ... 
  i kinda feel offended on the behalf of the dutch . 
  ( glanced at your profile . 
  i 'll never understand people like you . 
  even if you 're trolling , it looks rather low-energy tbh . ), 
  the problem with letting the russians have it : we 're back to year ' 45 . 
  there is absolutely no reason to stay in nato * or * the eu if the western powers ca n't even be bothered to defend `` the convenient shield '' . 
  in that situation , if i was estonian , i 'd let the russians roll through further . 
  same if i was poland . 
  let 's see how safe the west would feel without the east to take the hits . 
  i 'm pretty sure it 's a joke . 
  eastern europe is * always * to the east of where the speaker happens to be standing , that goes all the way to ukraine and russia . 
  huh . 
  i could have sworn they had visa-free travel , heard something on news ... but the correction is : they 'll get it in 2017 . 
  that was negotiated in return for stemming the immigrant-flow . 
  my mistake . 
  if they deport them back to the assigned countries , they 'll leave the next day again . 
  and short of raising a wall of china , putting them in prisons , or gps-collaring them like dogs ( with money we do n't have , so another thing rich eu will have to pay for ) , it 'll go on and on . 
  like an endless ping-pong match , and the definition of insanity . 
  i 'm moderately certain that some serbs switch to cyrillic when typing to us/around us precisely because they know we 're cyrillic-deficient . 
  worry not , you did n't !, 
  tln is a comedy group , they 're mocking the current state of affairs . 
  it used to be serbo-croatian officially , then those two split ( war ) , then bosnian went off as well ( war ) , then montenegrin went last ( referendum ) . 
  herzegovinan is a joke cause herzegovinans have a [ very recognizable ... style of doing life ] ( http://forum.net.hr/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver.discussions.components.files/31/4604.hercegovci_2d00_velika_5f00_fs.jpg ) and then montenegrin got split because , obviously , such a pun-opportunity is too good to pass . 
  and iirc they have regional/ethnic differences too . 
  and the moment they illegally leave for germany , as we all know they will , germany treats them as illegals and deports them . 
  it 's about saving face in terms of : a ) solidarity with border countries like greece and italy ; and b ) our own fancy humanitarian laws . 
  us euros are very `` cultured and progressive '' people , have n't you heard ? 
  so very * clean * and reasonable , in this world of growing crackpots , extremists and tin-pot dictators abusing whatever law they like . 
  as a result , germany & co get an out to get rid of those that break the law ( because d'oh , nobody here was born yesterday ) , and those that wo n't break the law , well they 're the sort that 'll probably work hard to integrate and be useful , so they 're alright to stay . 
  this way , * they just sort themselves out * , doing our processing work for us . 
  very efficient !, 
  if erdo decides to withdraw from the current treaty , we ~ ~ bring back the visa regime and ~ ~ momentarily suspend every single trading link with turkey . 
  and then we wait one month . 
  oh yes , we experienced both and have scars from * both * . 
  but real talk , people who compare the eu to the reich or to ussr have n't the faintest idea about how those two functioned . 
  `` minor details '' such as genocide , gulags , suppression of wrongthink , outright coups and assassinations seem to slip their minds . 
  which is actually very tone-deaf and insulting to the many and varied victims of the reich and ussr , now that i think about it . 
  and over here folks , you can observe how us yugos can always unite when it comes to `` bantering '' with bosniaks . 
  [ \\* cackles in yugoslavian * ] ( https://i.redd.it/7ygaeyqwxftx.png ), 
  as i said , i do n't have any strong feelings either way . 
  on one hand , it 'd be neat if we could understand each other well 100 years from now , but on the other hand , i 'm personally annoyed by even some of the standardization within croatian itself , so adding several countries and their dialects to it would just waste more time and nerves . 
  but the linguists * are * insisting that they 're different languages , and their arguments for it are so thin they 're almost transparent ( as things stand now ) . 
  and besides , they 're actually working on diverging them even more quickly from each other , either inventing words , or bringing old archaic ones into circulation , regardless of how people on the ground actually speak . 
  `` perilica za rublje '' , my croatian ass . 
  everybody calls it `` ve\u0161-ma\u0161ina '' !, 
  ah , yes you were mostly right . 
  [ map . 
  ] ( http://blog.b92.net/user_stuff/upload/141/k2.8141.jpg ) it used to follow borders [ more clearly before ] ( http://languagesoftheworld.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/serbo_croatian_dialects_historical_distribution.png ) ... except for croatia , cause we 're special snowflakes that way . 
  as a close neighbor , i can tell you that the best way to amuse self by triggering bosniaks is n't telling them that allah sucks . 
  it 's saying ** `` burek with cheese !, 
  the heritage argument is pretty silly , yes . 
  it all started with the same proto-slavic language iirc . 
  ( we did have very divergent histories for the past 1000 years tho - and in some cases even before we came to balkan - so in that we 're much , much further apart than the english colonies . ), 
  mind you , before the many , many standardizations , you had quite different/borderline incomprehensible dialects , man i remember reading assigned books written in 18th century dubrovnik , gave me lots of head-scratching . 
  and do n't even let me get started on the kajkavian folk , they 're still often * gibberish * today . 
  as for differences between english and american being bigger - i do n't think so . 
  specific words , yes . 
  but just the i/ije/je / e example mentioned up in the thread makes sure you * have to * have divergent schools , or else you 'll be quite illiterate . 
  it 's like the difference between * then * and * than * ( and the people who confuse them being judged as idiots ) applied to thousands and thousands of words . 
  and that 's before you come to vocabulary divergences , some 10 % at least , i think . 
  so we 're not quite set apart enough to be really called different languages ... but we 're distant enough to require different schools . 
  i think the various powers that be are always prone to corruption , greed , and blaming `` those others '' for their own problems . 
  and i do n't think the military threats help that much , whole history you had countries/peoples threatening each other with armies , it never worked . 
  you could make an argument for nukes ensuring peace , but ... 
  i think the actual credit goes to nerds who advanced our technology to the point when you do n't need to raid your neighbors ( as much ) to feed yourself , and to politicians + economists who were clever enough to tie all our wallets together ( eu for a smaller example , globalization for larger ) . 
  it 's simply not profitable enough to go to war anymore . 
  as for demographics . 
  over here , we were under incarnations of austro-hungary ( and venice ) since 1102 . 
  ottomans bit off chunks for a while too . 
  then we finally had yugoslavia , and now even the eu . 
  * and we 're still here , stubbornly . 
  * compared to the outright invasions and direct wars of the past , i 'm do n't fear that some clowns with bombs will kill us or our identity , when so many more respectable and efficient empires failed . 
  native americans lacked : a ) immunity to euro diseases , and b ) technological edge . 
  which is in no way true for the clowns we 're discussing now .
