  central balkan , explain yourself !, 
  are you feeling hungry ? 
  do we need to send burek-aid ? 
  erm ... 90 's are bad time to point at , look at my flair :d plus , even before 90 's , you had pretty lame communism in half of europe . 
  and i would n't call ussr and usa pointing nukes at each other , nukes that 'd probably meet somewhere in central europe and turn it into glass , as some example of peace or progress . 
  it 's was a mexican standoff with wmd 's and the iron curtain . 
  if you ask me , during the time europe was native european ... we were routinely butchering each other for clay/gold/resources / pride . 
  except even that native european claim gets absurd once you go too far in the past , i 'm pretty sure us slavs came to europe from asian borderlands ( somewhere around the caspian sea is the furthest we 've been traced ) . 
  romans and greeks can call us immigrants . 
  or even further back , the illyrians etc. 
  not to worry , all our migs are falling apart atm . 
  which i guess makes them dangerous if you can time their falling-apart correctly ? 
  modern 2015 example of a croatian-hungarian war ( same will probably apply to kosovo-whomever ) , credit to / u/cocojumbo123 ~ & nbsp ; field report of the croatian-hungarian war : hungary sent both tanks to occupy croatia . 
  croatia responded by sending both of their tanks too . 
  unfortunately all tanks broke on the way and due to the lack of soviet spare parts the mechanical warfare had to be canceled , to the disappointment of german tourists which came en mass to witness the event and spent the day placing towels on the beach chairs . 
  both croatian migs landed in bucharest due to autocorrect function in their iphones . 
  both hungarian grippens landed also there after experiencing a mysterious quantum anomaly pushing them towards east ( i.e. 
  romanian prime minister declares that this is a gross manipulation of ex-president basescu and will propose deporting all pilots to vaslui county . 
  out of other options hungary infantry attacked with shots of palinka to which croatia responded with a surprise sljivovica counter attack . 
  the situation got quickly confusing since both parties used the ancient battle-cry `` kurva '' so one could n't tell anymore friend and foe . 
  it is unclear who won the fierce battle , both sides claiming clear victory . 
  aftermath reports show a large number of injured , clearly in shock state , with trembling hands , difficulty on walking straight and hypersensitivity to strong light and noise . 
  austrian experts suspect this is a previously unknown form of ptsd . 
  in unrelated news , the pharmacy nearby reports they ran out of painkillers the morning after . 
  i do n't care much either way . 
  these languages were always very similar , and they were further artificially brought closer together . 
  without the political and linguistic will to keep them together , i can easily see them drifting apart within my lifetime ... it 's already happening tbh . 
  because while there 's a lot of mixing among close geographic/cultural/trading neighbors , there 's also a lot of natural dialect divergence if the standard language is n't forcefully kept together . 
  at some point , the dialects become so different that you may as well call it a day and name them `` language '' . 
  but i think that the many who insist that serbian , croatian , bosnian and montenegrin ( note that i do n't mention slovenian and macedonian ) are very different languages are just plain embarrassing themselves . 
  so according to them , zagorci , dalmatinci & slavonci speak the same language , different dialects . 
  serbs and croats speak different languages . 
  * meanwhile i find it easier to understand guys from belgrade than guys from split . 
  * i know we 're all triggered by politics and history here , but as things are now ( meaning : not in 1800 and not in 2050 ) , it 's all a pile of * scientific * horseshit . 
  aaaaaaand with the newest epochal discovery , [ top lista nadrealista informs us  ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj66gr8p1bs&amp;t )  the language that used to be imprecisely called serbo-croatian is n't one language , nor two languages , nor four , but unbelievably : six !, 
  serbian , croatian , bosnian , herzegovinan , montean , and negrin !, 
  ... this is the moment when i awkwardly shift and admit that i do n't know cyrillic ( . _ . ), 
  that is , i mostly do n't know it . 
  what i 've seen so far is that it 's the same system of writing that we have here with latin , the spoken sounds are transcribed in a way that follows what was said , because that * makes sense * , unlike english spelling which has n't been updated since the middle ages . 
  it 's `` phonemic writing '' . 
  so i * think * that the i/ije/je / e differences would be transcribed ? 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge4sxlgiaga ), 
  eh that 's slovenians , * they 're in full-blown denial . 
  * ( one of the funniest interactions on the internet , they 're so cute talking about how they `` do n't count '' because `` they were under austria '' for ages . ), 
  sometimes we 're `` south-east yurop '' ( stopped being central in 1918 , worst year of my life , reverse trianon reverse trianon ) , sometimes we look at our politicians or people listening to turbo-folk and shake head muttering `` balkan ! '', 
  it 's the i/ije/je / e thing . 
  different writing , pronunciation and accent , same word . 
  those are very common in the yugo language ( s ) , and they 're instantly recognizable . 
  for example , pretty - lipa , lijepa , lepa . 
  if you ask me , those 3 were spoken by a dalmatian , a northern croat , and a serb . 
  ( or possibly north - * west * croat or slovenian , they have the e 's sometimes . ), 
  we get `` triggered '' at ekavica , this example in the article made the * terrible , no good mistake * of using `` svet '' instead of `` svijet '' ( world ) . 
  as if literally everyone in this thread did n't immediately think `` islam '' when they saw it . 
  that 's what everyone first thinks when they see such news , so no , there 's no need to `` hint '' at the likely cause . 
  we 're not morons . 
  but / u/earthobserver is right in that we should wait until we have confirmation . 
  and personally , i find people getting onto their pet political platforms while the victims ' bodies are n't even cold rather tasteless . 
  as if there 's anyone * on this sub , in this moment * that actually wants this to continue , and as if we all would n't rather deport everyone who 's even * suspicious * , much less proven guilty , if going that far would be the price for our personal safety . 
  but deporting those that are n't proven guilty is a legal pandora 's box i 'm wary of opening . 
  ahhh ... ok i was confused too , mixed up things . 
  so we basically voted for 4 different things in these elections : + the city/town mayors + city hall + sort of a county/municipal mayor ? 
  + county/municipal hall and you could pick completely separate candidates for those 4 lists , it 's not like the parliamentary elections where you pick a party , and the party then decides who the pm and ministers will be ( though it 's usually known who the pm will be , generally the leader of that party ) . 
  so the hall voting is done , different parties will have different seats in the halls , according to how many votes they got . 
  ( except for the state-recognized minorities , they get automatic admission , some percentage of seats again . ), 
  while the votes for the both mayors - city and county - will go onto the 2nd round , in the cases where no candidates got over 50 % . 
  i 'd say that my personal impression is that the various mayors generally have more power than the city/county halls . 
  in any case , the halls are always stacked by parties from the regular parliament , usually yes-men . 
  while for example the zagreb `` bandit '' mayor , well he sort of `` got out of control '' according to the establishment . 
  they do n't own him anymore , and the good thing is that he 's a sold soul ( will cooperate with whomever allows him power ) , but he 's a mayor of basically 1/4 croats , which makes him apparently `` capable of being dangerous '' . 
  unlike the city halls . 
  + together with estonia and hungary , they 're the special snowflakes of yurop .
