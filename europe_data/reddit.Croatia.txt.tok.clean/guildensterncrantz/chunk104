  rather mixed . 
  plenty of cities and counties need to go into the 2nd round , but so far , hdz is leading in most ( won in some ) . 
  cities are more mixed , the `` 4 big ones '' , meaning zagreb , split , rijeka , and osijek , all have the 2nd round in which hdz is very likely to lose . 
  and the plot twist is , 3 of them ( so rijeka does n't count ) have leading candidates that are `` non-affiliated '' , which indicates that the more urban people are sick and tired of our eternal right vs left . 
  but hdz would win parliamentary elections if they happened now . 
  but then ... the 2nd plot twist ( we 're an entertaining nation here ) is that the zagreb candidate , milan bandi\u0107 , has been bossing zagreb for the past 17 years ... we usually call him `` bandit '' . 
  he builds a lot of fountains , for reasons nobody can explain . 
  then the split candidate is making a comeback ^ ^ tm after he was gone for 4 years , and ... [ relevant pic .

  one thing that certainly happened : the left-wing sdp opposition had an unsightly debacle ( they 're led by someone as popular as corbyn ) , most ( think macron ) did n't do so well either , but on the other hand , the chemtrails conspiracy edgelords also embarrassed themselves . 
  also , hdz may end up losing knin , the other symbol ( after vukovar ) of right-wing nationalism . 
  to another non-affiliated .

  right , but that would be the suppression/assimilation part . 
  the invented yugoslav identity sort of worked for that in yugoslavia , so long as nationalism was suppressed by strong leader ^ ^ tm and more importantly , the economy functioned enough .

  ( if you want to see a similar effect today , look at how eu is kinda closing ranks against uk , trump , erdogan , vladimir , etc etc. ), 
  my views on multi-culti are ~ it can work if it 's something minor like food/music/fashion / etc. 
  but if any minority gets : a ) such a percentage in a country as to be large enough , so 1 million turks in germany do n't count , but 20 million certainly would , and b ) the opportunity to build isolated enclaves/ghettos - you 'll have trouble . 
  the minority will make trouble by asking for special snowflake rights , or the majority will discriminate them because it 's always easier to blame the others , or some of both ( it 's a chicken-or-egg scenario imo ) . 
  in any case , you ca n't really have `` a society within a society '' . 
  ah , forgot about that . 
  well now i 'm offended on the behalf of the adriatic !, 
  clean up that mess , italy !, 
  huh , is your side of the adriatic lame or something ? 
  ( never been more south than venice , \\* cries in croatian * ) as for the cement , yeah i hope so too . 
  our folks seem aware of the fact that a lot of our appeal comes from : a ) we 're still cheaper than italy , france , etc , b ) lots of history , clash of cultures , plus we 're clean and `` untouched '' ( not for untouched , but the perception is what matters ) . 
  so they 're mostly trying to keep us clean and not-cement ( even started banning/putting limits on the tour ships stampede in dubrovnik ) . 
  but trying to keep yourself `` clean and wild '' for those that want `` the real ^ ^ tm experience '' is at odds with the ever-increasing arrivals , last year we had 15 million visitors ... in a country of 4 million . 
  so what do ?

  as far as i know , yes . 
  do n't misunderstand , yugoslavia was n't exactly golden for them , not economically and not even so much in terms of political rights ( like take the example of them having to registry as `` muslim '' instead of `` bosniak '' ) , but ~ that country is * complicated * , to put it mildly . 
  progressives may ramble about `` multi-kulti '' and `` we 're all one people '' all day long , but the facts remain : as the concepts of national identity were born/affirmed everywhere in the 19th century , a lot of unpleasant discrimination/expulsions of minorities followed for a long time afterwards ( just look at wwii ) , and if not expulsions , then suppression/assimilation of different people groups . 
  this was the rule . 
  bosnia was caught in a crossfire of that , because by mid 20th century , around half of its population were two different religions and ethnic groups , serbs and croats , and the country happened to neighbor serbia and croatia . 
  that 's a very fragile state . 
  and yugoslavia ensured - thorough good and and bad measures - that all that stuff about `` ethnicity '' ( and even moreso religion , because commies ) did n't really matter much anymore . 
  it was sort of like a more repressive version of the eu , who cares about borders and us vs them , when we 're all in the same basket . 
  to the surprise of no one , the breakup of yugoslavia did n't go very well in bosnia .

  yes , it 's still a requirement ( though apparently not a total one , for example if you show you 're seriously decreasing debt they may look the other way ) . 
  our debt to gdp stabilized in 2015 , fell in 2016 ( it 's at 84.2 % now ) , will continue to fall this year , and the next , and probably the one after that , etc. 
  meanwhile our deficit for last year was 0.8 % , so much below the 3 % limit .

  i 'm trembling in my funky socks , whatever will happen to our sovereign currency ? 
  except ~ when asked about the dangers of not having an independent currency , the governor of our national bank said the equivalent of `` u wot mate ? '', 
  we never had an independent currency , kuna was first pegged to deutsche mark , then to euro . 
  most of our large borrowing , both by firms and by random citizens , has long been in dm/euro . 
  occasionally usd . 
  our deficit has been reigned in , once we push our public debt further ( on good track so far ) , all we 'll be losing is ... the name .

  ... did you even read the article ? 
  if anything , it explains how germany needs to be gently walked into being a functional military force in europe ( the other two candidates are uk and france , and they 're both busy with other things ) . 
  and lord knows europe needs a functional military force , primarily for defense . 
  and it 's not just the article being an unsupported opinion piece , after wwii , germany has seemed to develop an allergy to most military activities . 
  it 's laudable in its own way , but `` speak softly and carry a big stick '' only works when you have an actual stick . 
  do n't forget to bring * ordnung must sein * and euromonies , will you ? 
  zagreb ( croatia ) , may 22 ( seenews ) - the european commission said on monday it has recommended to the council to close the excessive deficit procedure ( edp ) for croatia because the country has brought its deficit below 3 % of gdp . 
  croatia 's headline deficit decreased to 0.8 % of gdp in 2016 and is projected to rise slightly to 1.1 % in 2017 , before dropping to 0.9 % of gdp next year , the commission said in a statement . 
  the edp is a corrective mechanism the european union conceived to bring back the member states ' budget deficits to below 3 % of gdp and public debts to below 60 % of gdp . 
  croatia has been in the edp since january 2014 . 
  however , given that croatia 's general government gross debt-to-gdp ratio is projected to remain above the maastricht treaty reference value of 60 % , the commission explained that the edp can only be abrogated if the commission forecast indicates that the debt ratio fulfills the forward-looking element of the debt reduction benchmark . 
  the commission is also recommending portugal exit edp . 
  if this occurs , only four member states ( france , spain , greece and the united kingdom ) will remain under the corrective arm of the stability and growth pact , down from 24 countries in 2011 . 
  trolls are a minor section of the population . 
  and yes , i count politicians among trolls . 
  i can speak from some experience in heavy modding in a fairly large subreddit ( 347k people ) : there exist more trolls and fires to put out than what your common visitor would notice , and `` ordnung must sein '' is often a thankless job . 
  but at the same time , i 'd say that around 1-5 % of the visitors are the worst trolls that need intervention . 
  and i do n't even mean only `` the most obvious shills , trumpeters '' and such ( on the example of r/europe ) , because obvious troll is obvious , they get dog-piled by the usual normal subscribers quickly . 
  i 'm talking about the * intelligent * trolls , those that `` toe the line '' all the time , `` just asking ( loaded ) questions '' and so on , baiting people into slapfights . 
  several hours later , these slapfights have turned the debate into outright chaos , because normal people can be baited into becoming angry enough to act worse than the trolls that provoked them in the first place . 
  and those intelligent trolls are a seriously tiny section of the total troll count , but they do so much damage if left to run unchecked . 
  now , imagine they get paid for their trolling . 
  * that 's our politicians and the most dangerous among their shills . 
  govnoburza translates as shitmarket here .
