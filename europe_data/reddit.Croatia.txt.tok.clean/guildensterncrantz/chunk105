  hmm ... close enough !, 
  the thing about the admins is : they 're generally useless . 
  no , seriously . 
  they keep the site running from the coding perspective , the business side , and some , very occasional interaction with mods , like when it comes to * certain * ban-evasions ( we actually need to gather most of the evidence for them ) , brigading and so on . 
  otherwise , the day-to-day running of the actual subs and content that appears on them ? 
  that 's all done by users and mods . 
  so , 99 % of the actual policing that needs to be done is done by unpaid volunteers . 
  admin intervention is visible in extreme cases like t_d . 
  specific users may as well be an ocean away from them . 
  i ca n't be sure about these mods , as in what they did exactly , but it 's not a shadowban actually . 
  so shadowbans are done by reddit admins , they basically mean that all your posts and comments appear fine to you , but normal users ca n't see them . 
  mods * can * , but they 're not notified by automod or anything like that , and they 're not able to re-approve that content . 
  it 's a measure that 's usually saved for doxxers , worst ban-evaders etc. 
  mods have something different , two measures that are `` lighter '' than an outright ban : automod filtering and automod ban . 
  first just throws your content into the modqueue for review , but same content appears on the site normally . 
  second removes it altogether , and also throws it into the queue for review , so mods can decide to release your comment . 
  the am filtering is done for troublesome users , also various trigger-content like the n-word and such . 
  the am ban is done for those users that are judged as not exactly ban-worthy , but still very ghoulish ( constantly instigating slap-fights etc ) , and also users who are likely to do ban-evasion ( they 're not notified of their effective ban , so they do n't make a new troll-account ) . 
  do my cats count as persons ? 
  i also criticize their greediness at least two times per day !, 
  fwiw your war against t_d was the funniest night/day of meme-ing i ever saw on reddit . 
  srd overdosed , i think ;d, 
  huh , i thought that the way they poldered innocent flags in their colonization of r/place made that clear ? 
  r/croatia is alright . 
  [ apparently we 're over-represented on reddit . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5t6rde/european_parliament_of_reddit_distribution_of/ddkkgm1/ ) the sub has enough people to be active , though of course not on the level of subs i usually visit . 
  it was a good idea to herd all the tourist questions to a stickied megathread . 
  and what i 've seen for now , mods do a good job of hammering the worst trolling offenders , but they do n't even have all that much work in that regard : typical morons that plague many of our internet forums ( think the equivalent of putinbots ) get dog-piled by the sub quickly . 
  only major thing that irks me is the amount of grumbling about * everything * , but then again , that 's our greatest national sport , nothing much the mods or the sub can do about that . 
  ( we 're kinda like the french , except we rarely strike . ), 
   of course big nations should be more powerful . 
  look , by all practical considerations , we 're already a colony of the larger eu states . 
  always have been through all our history , actually . 
  if germany/france/etc wanted to do a , and we wanted b , what could we * actually * do ? 
  we 're small by population , small by geography , small by economy , almost non-existent by influence . 
  do n't take this last tiny almost-irrelevant thing away from us , alright ? 
  side-note : their [ coat of arms ] ( http://www.mladina.si/media/www/slike.old/clanki/200808/m-grbi05-slovenija_display.jpg ) depicts triglav , yes . 
  triglav translates as `` three-head '' . 
  well , if we include today , the first round of local elections . 
  hopefully the political `` promotion '' ( read : lots of poo flinging ) will calm down soon . 
  on the other hand , the `` construction '' projects will probably ease down as well , as it happens around and after every elections . 
  perhaps the solution to permanently building lots of stuff would be to have endless elections , like usa ? 
  also people from the eurozone spending tourist moneys . 
  well if anyone could become the capital of the eu , it 'd be belgium . 
  strangest country this side of bosnia . 
  well what if i prefer nike tracksuits ? 
  does that make be a bad slav ? 
  yes and no ? 
  that is , yes i agree in theory , power corrupts and all that , dictatorships are far too prone to abuse . 
  but we do n't have that much experience with democratic leaders ... and neither does the world history , to be fair . 
  and then it 's all generally tangled up , democracy could n't have possibly worked out 300 years ago when technological development was low , and populace was uneducated and uninformed ( unless we count tiny cities or villages ) . 
  i can say with confidence that when all is said and done , we live better in 2017 than we did in 1967 or 1850 , but i 'm prone to giving most of the credit for that to nerds bringing up the standard of living , instead of the politicians evolving how they do things . 
  and even with that , i can also say that today we have much greater freedom of speech , but in tito 's yugoslavia , we had much greater worker 's rights , we were less enslaved to our employer 's whims . 
  so does the credit for that go to communism vs capitalism , or dictatorship vs democracy ? 
  difficult to untangle since communism and democracy do n't have many ( any , i think ) clear examples . 
  then communism itself did n't work out nearly as well elsewhere . 
  so does that tell us it depends on the leader himself , or the system , or both ? 
  in any case , yugoslavia itself getting more democracy did n't work out very well . 
  i have a lot of questions . 
  for example : how would today 's `` democracy '' work out if we * did n't * have the technological progress that allows us to watch all these politicians like hawks ? 
  i seriously doubt they 'd be as close to `` tolerable '' as they are now , regardless of the official system implemented . 
  they 're all ( potential ) thieves , same as always . 
  is this another culture thing/folk tale ? 
  correct in all you said , strange that franz joseph does n't get such good rep. and yes , all of my family would give good ratings to maria , but my grandma is * especially * taken with her . 
  hm , [ maria theresa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_theresa ) was a tyrant , and if you ask me , she did more good for this place than all our democratically-elected governments combined . 
  there 's a saying here - sto babica , kilavo dijete . 
  `` 100 midwives , sluggish baby '' . 
  basically it means that if you have too many sides wanting different things , nothing ever gets done . 
  imo today 's politicians are too tied to popularity and elections to do things that need doing , but would make people unhappy , like for example firing all the useless paper-pushers that burden our taxes . 
  and then they lack much of * real power * , like for example owning enough land/economy , to do much even if they wanted to . 
  i go out and vote for this party or that party , but the closest thing to real `` boss '' in the last 20-ish years would be [ ivica todori\u0107 and his agrokor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agrokor ) , and i do n't get any say in how * that * is run . 
  mind you , democracy is preferable to tyrants who 'd just so happen to be * unenlightened * , unlike maria . 
  much more room for abuse if power is concentrated in too few people . 
  but this system we have now may be the least of all evils , but it is n't doing enough good , either . 
  needs improvements , but the thing is , nobody really knows how to improve it . 
  do n't know how the mods define it , but i see other genocides `` debated '' all the time . 
  holodomor , srebrenica and so on , you get arguments on whether it was war crime , ethnic cleansing and so on , whether the soviets for example can be judged as directly guilty for holodomor ( how guilty can someone be for a * hunger * which is n't as clear-cut as violent killing ) . 
  arguments that i see tend to be similar for the irish famine for example . 
  point being , it is debated , regardless of how the comments do in karma/approval , they 're allowed to exist . 
  i take it that the rule is a catch-all for clearer cases like holocaust , plus the more ... unsavory type of comments . 
  you make a rule that 's pretty draconian if taken at face value , and then selectively apply it for worst cases , because otherwise you 'd get `` waahh waahh why ca n't i ~ ~ deny ~ ~ debate holocaust if one is allowed to debate holodomor !!! 1 ! '', 
  huh , is this the point where we stop trying to claim tesla ? 
  ^ ( this comment was brought to you by the croatian ministry of tourism ) ^ ( except they 're not paying me for it ) ^ ( ... i should see about changing that ) --------------------------- seasons/months in croatia , on the example of plitvice : [ summer ] ( https://www.natureflip.com/sites/default/files/photo//plitvice-waterfalls-the-highest-waterfalls-are-the-large-waterfall-at-the-end-of-the-lower-lakes.jpg ) , [ mid-autumn ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/e1/3b/ac/e13bacbcab6506a80ba15403fffe59b0.jpg ) , [ late-autumn ] ( http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000pjj8ioacsq8/s/880/880/ah-veliki-slap-sastavci-waterfalls-plitvice-lakes-national-park-croatia-4575.jpg ) , [ winter . 
  ] ( http://www.np-plitvicka-jezera.hr/files/g/1-0/540x360-4/veliki-slap-sastavci.jpg ) if you 'll be staying overnight : [ rastoke is nice . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rastoke ) avoid the trains , go by either car or bus . 
  [ bus schedules here . 
  ] ( http://www.buscroatia.com/bus-plitvice-lakes/ ) rumors have it that one can `` go over the fence '' and thus avoid the tickets , but you 'll find it hard to take the little trains or boats without the ticket , so ... that 'll mean 5-6 more hours of extra walking , i think . 
  basically , do n't be a wildling , cough up the money . 
  if you happen to be a student , see if they 'll recognize your student id , i got away with a respectable discount . 
  factors that add to the crowds of selfie-taking tourists blocking the little paths : summer , height of the season ( think mid-point between july and august ) , weekend or state holiday ( both croatian and ferragosto ) , early afternoon . 
  count on temperatures that are 10-15 degrees colder than the coast , plitvice has the mountainous climate that has nothing to do with either zagreb or dubrovnik . 
  also , it 's a national park , meaning : bring water and food for the inside of the park , no/few shops there . 
  also sensible shoes are a must , [ relevant picture of a path . 
  ] ( https://misstourist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/plitvice-lakes-path.jpg ) finally , there are several routes . 
  i think the 2nd longest ( iirc ) one is the best , takes around 5-6 hours in all . 
  start with the opposite side from the big waterfall , because you keep the best for the end , and go downhill ( relevant for your legs ) : [ entrance 2 -  st3 .

  the thing with school cheating here : depends on the subject . 
  as in , whether you figure it 's an `` useless '' subject . 
  for example , you mean to ... not go to college afterwards .
