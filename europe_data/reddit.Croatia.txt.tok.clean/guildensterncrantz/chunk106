  because you have serious connections for `` fictional jobs that were invented for social peace or connected people '' , or you 're in a field like it where you need to know code , which you learned in your spare time anyways . 
  or you 'd like to be poor , for whatever reason . 
  otherwise , you 'll go to a stem field in college , well you do n't need the `` history of art '' . 
  or you 'll go to languages , well you 'll never meet higher math again in your life . 
  you need history for neither . 
  so , you cheat those in high school ( or even primary school , up to a point ) , because our schooling is jack of all trades , master of nothing , recent graduates are kinda useless to employers , bla bla . 
  in matura : you have croatian , math , english ( or some other foreign , like german ) , plus the optional 4th ( or even 5th ) subject depending on your college . 
  like biology for medicine , history for history , and so on . 
  i went to the new matura because bologna system and its friends said my old matura did n't count , because fuck logic . 
  first : the new one is easier than what my gymnasium had before . 
  second : if you ca n't pass the croatian with a 2 , you 're an illiterate hillbilly . 
  if you ca n't pass math , you have no business entering any of the stem fields or economics or any college that asks for math , which is the majority of colleges . 
  if you ca n't pass english or german , shame on you , do you think croatia is usa and uk and does n't need at least some basic foreign ? 
  ditto for the `` optional '' 4th subject specific colleges ask for . 
  so tl ; dr : you can cheat , but it 's useless if you 'll looking to get into any college ( you 'll fail the first semester there ) , and the matura is fairly easy/basic imo , so shame on you . 
  [ shame !,

  ahah , well , sorry ? 
  :d for what it 's worth , all in all he seemed like a cool dude . 
  not perfect , but we were taught about him as a good example of `` how to modernize your country '' . 
  in any case , i 'll sooner trust un or icty or even cia * than anyone from here * . 
  numbers wary so wildly when you ask croats , serbs , even bosniaks . 
  and i seem to remember all sides doing historical revisions to facts , motivations and numbers , whenever political points needed scoring . 
  the outsiders at least do n't give three shits about any of us , at most we 're an afterthought . 
  so they have less reason to do badhistory . 
  tbh that sounds adorable af . 
  even sugary , like `` omg they finally got a room , aww my teeth ! '', 
  funny too , in the / r/madlads style : '' d as a side-note : it 's a shame you and turks get so much heat in this sub . 
  i mean there are the occasional erdo and putin bots , but those get justly dog-piled in short order . 
  the rest , something like 90 % at least , the worst of the bots and the `` totalitarian minded , violent , uneducated '' voters this sub like to think it `` fights '' , well they 're not gon na come here in the first place . 
  for example there 's all the triggering at posts that suggest we might honor the fallen of the soviet union , the common people that fought against nazis ... it 's quite embarrassing imo . 
  about [ matura ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matura ) :  ( ... ) is a latin name for the high-school exit exam or `` maturity diploma '' in various countries , including albania , austria , bosnia and herzegovina , bulgaria , croatia , the czech republic , hungary , italy , kosovo , liechtenstein , macedonia , montenegro , poland , serbia , slovakia , slovenia , switzerland and ukraine . 
   matura is a matriculation examination and can be compared to a-level exams or abitur . 
  & nbsp ; so , what do your high school graduates do on the last day ? 
  we have the usual march though the town , cultured activities like quadrilla included . 
  * mind you , when i graduated , we had the 4 quadrilla parts ( ? ), 
  of the dance , and then the fifth was [ numa numa ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oe8wzynrpnu ) because why not . 
  * afterwards we go to open concerts and get outrageously drunk , to balance the excess `` culture '' earlier in the day . 
  mm , it depends from case to case here too . 
  we 're basically building a 3rd house in the same backyard now ( 4 generations and counting !, 
  ) , so there 's always someone around to help gradma and grandpa - gramps is immobile now , but grandma is also retired so she does most of the work around him . 
  the rest of us help with the `` heavy lifting '' and such , cause grandma is also getting too old for that . 
  but if the situation was different , you have an immobile old dying person , and their children are both working ( say , there 's just the 4 people in that house ) , well it 'd be off to the retirement home as well . 
  luckily for us , we have plenty of unemployed , so !, 
  silver linings xd, 
  problem is not just the borders . 
  well , it is the borders , they were drawn up by war ( including ethnic cleansing ) , not exactly fairness or population size . 
  srpska has 49 % , but iirc they 're around 30 % of the total population . 
  so what do ? 
  and the border divisions today mostly follow ethnicity , however , even the serb-majority areas have bosniak and croat percentages , and same goes for all 3 sides . 
  then what do you do about kinda-evenly split places like mostar ? 
  and then you have issues like ... ok , to solve some of the border-gore , i 'd give the southern and some northernmost parts to croatia ( that 's basically how it looks today ) , the east would in large part go to serbia . 
  to make the countries look less ridiculous , you know ? 
  but then , what about banja luka ? 
  it 's the srpska capital and pretty far west . 
  then sarajevo is too far east . 
  and so on ... and bosniaks would n't want that to happen anyways , they 'd be the total losers of their country losing half of the population and 2/3 of the territory . 
  and finally ~ croatia incorporating herzeg-bosna would be kinda like romania incorporating moldova . 
  same for serbia and srpska . 
  we wo n't be able to handle that for quite some time yet ... or want to handle it , for that matter . 
  i 'd probably vote no if the proposal went up in 2018 . 
  [ milan marti\u0107 ordered them to leave . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/republic_of_serbian_krajina#operation_storm ) and leaving out of fear does n't count , or else every single war where the civilian populace flees would count as ethnic cleansing . 
  like for example most of croatian cities that were under attack , and had an exodus , or basically ... all of bosnia . 
  now we can talk about whether they had legit reasons to be afraid ( they did ) , what the cause of that fear was ( year 45 or year 91 ? ), 
  and so on until we 're blue in the face . 
  but to have accusations of cleansing stick , you need to have an army/state literally forcing people out at gunpoint . 
  in any case , this is getting long , i wrote what i think about storm and that war [ in this thread on r/serbia . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/serbia/comments/6bbfss/25_godina_od_tuzlanske_kolone_i_pravda_stradala_u/ ) you may be surprised :p, 
  i talked about this before with you , it was n't forgotten . 
  if anything , it was remembered too much , how can you heal the wounds and make anything like `` brotherhood and unity '' if you constantly repeat crimes one side did to the other for more than 40 years after the fact ? 
  and let 's not even go into how the figures were inflated , those strange numbers of what , 1 million ? 
  whole ndh had 7 million people . 
  to put it in an insensitive way - that 'd make us as * efficient * as germans . 
  and then again , it matters that it was basically a civil war where even ethnicity split apart ( \u010cetnici , too ) , and then even the partisans were n't exactly spotless , and that was certainly swept under the carpet . 
  not a healthy cocktail . 
  this thing again . 
  you do know that ndh killed more than just serbs ? 
  jews , roma , croat opposition . 
  yes , of course serbs were the biggest victims and it was a genocide over them in both intention and effect , but there 's also the fact that the resistance - partisans - started in croatia , had quite a few croats in it , and tito was croat by birthplace , childhood , and father , while his mother was a slovene . 
  and the whole point of the partisans and the communism they brought along was doing away with nationalistic divides . 
  and they succeeded in liberating yugoslavia from both ndh and nazis . 
  the equivalent would be ... if srpska/serbia/serbs in general made their own strong resistance movement to what jna & separatists were doing , and they succeeded . 
  which obviously was n't the case . 
  that matters a lot . 
  eh , if the montenegrins were very pro-russian , they would n't have hopped on the nato train . 
  or the eu , for that matter . 
  theoretically those two are n't the enemies of russia/russia is n't their enemy ... in practice , however , it 's clear to everyone and their grandmother that they are . 
  yeah ... there was also the perception ( regardless of how true ) that serbs took up an unfair percentage of officers and bosses etc. 
  plus the government was in belgrade , it 's sort of like the brussels today , whenever `` the eu '' does something people do n't like , `` brussels did this , brussels did that , fuck brussels !! '', 
   is it important if it ends the same way ? 
  hah , on the face of it it does n't . 
  you have a problem ... you get rid of the problem , dubious morality disregarded . 
  ( like for example compare croatia and bosnia today . ), 
  as for tito , [ o7 ] ( https://i2.wp.com/www.portalnovosti.com/img/media/image/tc4h1hwg7r8j2wq01om2f1al78x.jpg ) :d no but seriously . 
  i loved it how he exhorted money from everyone . 
  tito goes to usa , says `` ohh dear the soviets are trying to build a base here , how sad . 
  and you know , i could use a new factory , fine gentlemen . '', 
  tito goes to ussr , says `` ohh dear the americans are trying to build a base here , how sad . 
  and you know , i could use a new railway , dear comrades . '',
