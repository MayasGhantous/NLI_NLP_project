  and the country industrialized and traded with all sides , including random africa . 
  it still brings a misty tear to my eye xd mind you , i think he did well enough , or as well as could be done in post-wwii . 
  but some issues were swept under the carpet , and they just popped up again after he was gone and economy went to hell . 
  and while i 'm generally against stupid nationalism , capitalist pigdogs owning everything , the issues with religion ( we call them * catholibans * ) and so on ... repression is n't a good long-term solution . 
  you wo n't teach people to be better if you imprison wrongthink , that just gives you a `` fuck da police !! '', 
  boomerang in the end . 
  \\* sigh * i wish he/they repressed nationalism and religion less , let them die off more naturally . 
  now those two just made themselves into `` martyr revolutionaries '' against those `` bad , bad commies '' . 
  but oh well . 
  also as far as i can tell , the south dislikes renting more than the north . 
  over here , renting is basically what you do if you have to move for college , or you move around a lot for a job , and this second is pretty rare . 
  otherwise , it 's seen as burning money for nothing . 
  so you basically wait until you have a good enough job to finance the difference between the renting and buying rates/loans . 
  or until you marry and start your own family . 
  my example , i 'm nearing 30 and still living with grandma , and i 'll stay in this house - inherit it - if i do n't marry . 
  living with her is n't a problem , i 'm on ground floor she 's on upper ... and as i see it , i have more space here than in some crappy shoebox apartment , where i 'd have a million nosy neighbors . 
  well ... things were complicated in yugoslavia . 
  imagine the dankest nightmares of the brexiters . 
  now imagine they 're actually true . 
  it was something like that . 
  it kinda worked while the political strongman-repression functioned , and more importantly , the economy was good . 
  [ and then it was n't anymore . 
  ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/archive/fullsize/econ-module-yogu-gdp-chart-8_b2af6c1915.jpg ) typical stuff happened , you can see the same happening across usa and the eu in more recent years , the kicker is that after you add everything up , eu is still prosperous ( and powerless enough ) , and it has n't been made politically irrelevant by the fall of the soviets either . 
  in any case ... 
  i think minorities * can * work out , but obviously they need to be integrated . 
  first step towards that would be : scatter them around , do n't let them build enclaves , or even worse , ghettos , and ... 20 % of your country being * one * specific minority , well you 'll probably have trouble . 
  i do n't know if it 's because they 're discriminated so they stop trying to integrate , or they 're `` discriminated '' * because * they 're not willing to integrate in the first place , a sort of a chicken-or-egg scenario . 
  ( for example , the roma in basically every country . ), 
  but well , we do n't have good experience with minorities ( and before the breakup of yugoslavia , like for example the germans during wwii ) . 
  so i 'm wary about the idealistic `` multi-kulti '' proposals . 
  but in this case , i do n't feel i have much cause for concern , our quota is 1064 . 
  rosencrantz and guildenstern ? 
  also , did you happen to hang around r/asoiaf ? 
  i used to live there for over a year ( to the point they gave me a mod hat , i can say that it 's very fancy ) , before sailing to r/europe . 
  as things stand , for all i know i may end up sailing off to irl one of these days o.o, 
  that 's ... among the nicest and definitely the strangest compliment anyone ever gave me ( \uff89 \u25d5 \u30ee \u25d5 ) \uff89 * : \uff65 \uff9f \u2727,

  ** it feels like europe . 
  i love it to bits . 
  ** good job , op !, 
  [ such is life in post-yugoslav balkans ] ( http://imgur.com/gzljo ), 
  oh , i think fort europa ^ ^ tm is just a matter of * when * , not * if * . 
  if not in 2017 or 2020 , then in 2030 or 2040 . 
  we 're just not there yet mentally , `` dealing with it '' will require some unsavory actions on borders , be they land or sea . 
  but in any case , if we break the eu now , it 'll be every man for himself . 
  they 'll keep landing in italy and greece because they wo n't be able to shut the routes completely , and they wo n't even * want to * , because they 'll know everyone will be trying to get to the richer lands . 
  then italy and greece will just let them through , mass-migration style . 
  if global warming gets bad enough , us southern euros will join the wave . 
  i hear there 's space in siberia . 
  ok , then what 's the problem ? 
  we accepted our quota - even raised it - because we were n't born yesterday and we do n't feel like fighting windmills . 
  most of our lot is gon na leave croatia in a twinkling . 
  and since we wo n't be allowed to do , what , gps collar them like dogs ? 
  put them in prison ? 
  raise a chinese wall on our border ? 
  there 's nothing anyone will be able to do about that , not us , and not `` the eu '' . 
  and once they run away for germany , well germany will probably rage quit at some point and start mass-deporting them , because they 're perfectly * illegal * there . 
  problem solved , and it relieves greece and italy , which is what this whole 2015 quota is about . 
  you know , i honestly doubt it 'll get much worse . 
  eu does n't need more le pen scares , and i think that even germans and swedes are sick of this situation . 
  these quotas from 2015 are basically just meant to relieve italy and greece . 
  the greek pipeline has been mostly closed by turkey ( which is why erdo can blackmail us now ) , they 're trying to work something out with libya as well . 
  or we 'll increase border patrol , which is in the works afaik . 
  wo n't stop them all ( europe will be more peaceful and rich than africa for ... some decades yet , at least ) , but slow it down to acceptable levels . 
  haha ... 
  i do n't think that ever happened :p no , but seriously , at least over here we had a few centuries of venice nibbling the coast and ottomans trying to invade at the same time . 
  ( at least venice counts as eu . ), 
  before that , hmm , i * think * we had some mostly peaceful periods around ... 13th century or so ? 
  but i seriously doubt there were no other wars in the 13th century elsewhere in europe . 
  west , central and north euros have been redrawing borders every other decade , or at least that 's my impression . 
  basically some smart people put their heads together , and figured out that the only way to make us stop endlessly stealing each other 's stuff is to ... share all our stuff . 
   poland has to take ~ ~ few million ~ ~ immigrants from middle east . 
  it 's [ 9287 . 
  ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-odpmak5u__4/vgkjwggon4i/aaaaaaaaaa0/jxut5_pkh7m/s1600/4439-1j6f5bg.png ), 
  and yet they freak out and talk about leaving the moment eu tries to impose rules , like in this case . 
  correction ... impose quotas that were already agreed to by the member states . 
  so schr\u00f6dinger 's eu is simultaneously not strong enough and too much of a tyrant . 
  and it 's not even mass amounts , [ 9287 for poland . 
  ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-odpmak5u__4/vgkjwggon4i/aaaaaaaaaa0/jxut5_pkh7m/s1600/4439-1j6f5bg.png ) a country of 38 million . 
  i 'm not completely dismissing it . 
  i 'm saying there 's some manner of `` crisis '' every year or so . 
  following the media and the politicians in too much detail , well it 'd drive you mildly insane most likely , certainly depressed and/or paranoid , stacking cans for the apocalypse . 
  our brains are wired to find danger `` more interesting '' than good news ( it served us well , the optimistic guy got eaten by a tiger ) , but the media went too far with it simply for the sake of sales . 
  a single plane crashes , it 's on all news . 
  thousands of planes safely ferry people to their jobs , tourism , families etc every day , and nobody cares because it 's `` not interesting '' . 
  in the height of the refugee crisis of 2015 , my country was a `` crisis transit route '' . 
  my politicians were being their moronic selves . 
  the neighboring politicians were the same . 
  `` omg omg another crisis in the balkans , hide yo wife hide yo children there 'll be something bad starting in the gunpowder balkans agaaaaaaain ~ '' and you know , i never saw a single refugee . 
  if i did n't follow the news , * i would n't even know they passed through my city . 
  * my life changed in no way whatsoever . 
  when i ask my dad , he tells me about `` a major crisis '' happening every single decade since the 60 's . 
  and every single time , the media cried doom . 
  up to , and including , a literal * war * that i remember . 
  we 're still here . 
  and 900 years of different versions of unions with eu-lookalikes , plus attempted invasions , they ^ tm still have n't destroyed our identity or culture or killed us , for that matter . 
  a few million immigrants - and dubious politicians using them to score points - has nothing on that . 
  but if i 'm reading this right , fyrom is i2 + j+j 2 .
