  i2 is in serbia and bulgaria , j2 is in greece/albania/turkey . 
  hungary is r1a + r1b + i2 . 
  r1a and r1b are present in austria/germany/czechia , i2 and r1a in the rest of us surrounding slavs . 
  it makes sense . 
  i think your mobile went cray , you posted this comment over a dozen times ~, 
  ... i 'm not even czech and i 'm offended on behalf of staropramen !, 
  so ... the yellow are slavs ? 
  blue ... ? 
  anyone who gets dna mind explaining ? 
  eli5 version , i know that it 's not simple , as in it does n't quite go `` r1a is slavs '' , but still . 
  as simple/close as possible to `` so this is celtic heritage , this is sami , this is [ christopher lee ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc0s60gp5rm ) '' it can get without being useless . 
  as far as i know , the idea is to prop up the semi-functional government that libya has atm . 
  problem is , they 're too dysfunctional to patrol their coast/borders properly ( they do n't even control the whole area of libya ) , but if we basically illegally annex some bit of land there , we 're not helping with the whole project of `` make libya a real country again '' . 
  basically , killing gaddafi was a mistake in hindsight ( woooow , who knew , not like stuff like that happened other times we got involved for the sake of `` democracy '' ) , so now we 're trying to find some acceptably functional replacement . 
  hence the training for their coastal guard , the boat-loans etc etc. 
  do n't even bother . 
  a month ago , le pen was the crisis , before that it was erdogan , in the meantime we had trump and putin and brexit and on and on . 
  but telling people that it takes time to sort out the valid asylum requests , the border guard , the issues in africa and middle east that wo n't stop just because we want it - there are your downvotes . 
  or that if eu and europe ca n't sort out a little over 1 million - 1,5 million ? 
  - requests in 2015 , then * we 're all gon na die * in 2040 when africa dries out even further and we have 1 billion trying to get in , so this whole `` omg this is our doom '' is a moot point line of thinking - there , more downvotes . 
  if you ask me , the politicians who shout a lot , drag their feet over feasible solutions , but propose no valid solutions of their own - well , if anyone or anything dooms the eu , it 'll be them . 
  you do n't get to keep the money . 
  we do n't get to keep the money . 
  let 's not kid ourselves about who pays for this whole show in the eu , or why most of us are here . 
  peace ( seemingly increasingly forgotten or taken for granted ) , and * money * . 
  money for us europoors in terms of us more easily moving west , and the industry more easily moving east . 
  money for the west in terms of new markets and cheaper/new workforce . 
  and let 's not forget the type of `` friendly neighbors '' us border-lands have , and how we 'd be easy/easier pickings for them again , should the eu fall apart . 
  but that 's the peace part that 's being taken for granted , as if peace in europe is the natural state of things . 
  the quotas are first and foremost for those that are already in italy and greece . 
  people talk about `` strengthening borders '' , as if that 's going to help * with those already here * . 
  borders are a point of discussion for today and the future , not 2015 . 
  also , how would you solve the problem of smugglers getting people into italy 's waters ? 
  or , getting people close enough to italy 's coastal guard , and then intentionally sinking the boat , which obliges italy to rescue those people by maritime law ? 
  do we sink them ? 
  shoot them ? 
  deport them like australia ... where ? 
  as far as i 'm aware , we do n't even have a conveniently distant christmas island . 
  greece 's million aegean islands are way too close to turkey , which makes the situation incomparable to australia . 
  also , when it comes to deportations . 
  how do we do that , if libya/sudan/eritrea / syria/etc do n't let us do it ? 
  someone proposed dumping them into tunisia in one of these threads . 
  problem is , tunisia does n't allow that to happen . 
  do we invade tunisia 's soil ? 
  or buy them off somehow ? 
  we already tried to negotiate with them , it did n't work . 
  edit : it 'd be nice if you had an argument against what i said . 
  ---------------------- no , but seriously . 
  yes , i agree in principle that this was badly handled way back in 2015 ( or even earlier ) . 
  but , unless poland , hungary etc propose that we work out a plan to catapult the ones already in italy and greece back to syria/libya/sudan / outer mongolia * or wherever they are from * , and here i 'm talking real details , like annoying things such as international law etc ( basically , are we clear to pretty much invade libya ? 
  ) , this whole `` moral sovereign stand '' is getting old , fast . 
  [ here are the proposed quotas from 2015 . 
  ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-odpmak5u__4/vgkjwggon4i/aaaaaaaaaa0/jxut5_pkh7m/s1600/4439-1j6f5bg.png ) as far as i 'm aware the scale - the percentages and rough numbers given to countries - have n't changed much since then . 
  so poland , a country of 38 million people , is shouting a lot about ... * less than 10 000 people * . 
  most of whom will pack up and leave for germany the next day , thus making themselves `` somebody else 's problem '' , same as they are `` somebody else 's problem '' right now . 
  these days i 'd rather go back to shitposting about `` omg look at the newest crazy thing erdocrazy said !, 
   you do n't get to decide the future of the uk . 
  well nobody gets to decide what you do , as long as it 's legal . 
  ( brexit is legal . ), 
  but both eu and usa get to speak their opinions because brexit does change things for them . 
  eu can say `` do n't leave eu '' because it 's eu , obviously , usa gets to say `` do n't leave eu '' because usa is a big trading/army/etc partner to both eu and uk outside of eu . 
  obama can certainly say `` if uk leaves eu , it 'll be last in line for trading agreements '' and such , because it concerns actions that are/will be done by usa . 
  i get you , you ca n't take them in . 
  we ca n't take them in either ( beyond some tiny number ) . 
  but i 'm talking about them refusing to stay in for example czechia , or even refusing to go there . 
  imo , first step towards the solution would be germany , sweden & co shouting very loudly `` fuck off we 're full '' . 
  it 's much cheaper than any other measure ... other measures being : better deportation of those that are rejected on asylum grounds , better border patrol , no more taxi service in the mediterranean . 
  i expect some people will die in those leaky boats once the coastal guard and ngo 's stop rescuing them ( which is what the smugglers are counting on ) , but they 're dying anyways , and once the news got out , fewer would try in the first place . 
  it 'd all cost us some money and morality , but in the long term it 's cheaper than trying to accept millions we ca n't handle and take care of . 
  because i do n't think this is going to stop . 
  africa is drying out as we speak , 2040 will make 2015 look like a minor incident . 
  germany should change that . 
  as far as i know , neither the eu nor the un nor any other political structure forces germany to pay for illegals . 
  that 'd be absolutely absurd , if that worked out , one billion africans could tomorrow get into germany and demand benefits . 
  the most they can expect to get is charity . 
  but would you demand that people treat you like a refugee then ? 
  as i see it , you ca n't have it both ways . 
  of course it makes more sense to try germany , us europoors have been trying to get there ... well , for decades . 
  but we do n't call ourselves refugees . 
  and refusing to cooperate to the point they wo n't even let themselves be fingerprinted , crossing the borders through random cornfields , storming the fences , well if you ask me , that looks less like people politely asking for help , and more like an illegal invasion . 
  and i can speak from some recent experience about people feeling war , many fled croatia and bosnia in the 90 's . 
  they were n't doing it through random cornfields , and they did n't all stampede towards germany , what hungarian police is saying be damned . 
  you may hope you end up in a richer country where you already have some family , and speak the language , but you accept * whomever will take you . 
  so we 're just 5 beers away from czech-senpai !, 
  ... gib more staropramen pls \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064, 
  well , we 'd be ... if our bureaucracy and taxes had n't killed that movement dead :p plus , we 're a fairly small population , and our clay has few natural resources ( unless you count pretty vistas ) so some massive movement of industry probably is n't profitable enough when compared to for example poland that has close to 40 million people . 
  ( so that 's almost 10x our size . ), 
  basically , from what i know of most of our industry , it 's mostly the stuff we managed to keep from the commie times , or grow/improve on our own . 
  i do n't know , is it making a profit ? 
  or can it be restructured so that it makes a profit ? 
  if that works , then yeah you should keep it for sure , we have a long tradition and apparently the know-how . 
  otherwise , if we need to rescue the shipyards with tax money every few years , same tax money that 's made by industries and services that actually work ( but are barely keeping afloat ) , then the shipyards should stop pulling our collective leg . 
  well having no industry and no tourism is worse than having no industry and good tourism . 
  if we already have a beautiful country with good touristic infrastructure , why not use it ? 
  :p plus , if you ask me , i 'd say that our reliance on tourism is much less dangerous than our reliance on giants like agrokor ( around 15 % of our gdp , * in the hands of a single greedy company * ) . 
  and in any case , even our % of industry in gdp [ is n't actually that bad ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69mwda/gdp_composition_2016_estimates_cia_world_factbook/ ) in european terms . 
  we just need to figure out how to be generally more competitive in industry and services , which will first mean figuring out a few fields where we 'll be good enough . 
  my economy teacher had rants about that , how everyone is trying to make us a `` jack of all trades '' , in a tiny country of 4 million . 
  communism is dead comrade , let the lousy textile industry die already , focus on something doable . 
  and fire the paper-pushers that leech from our taxes .
