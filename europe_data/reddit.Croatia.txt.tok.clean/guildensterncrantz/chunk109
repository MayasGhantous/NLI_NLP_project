  that 's another place where communism should die already . 
  sadly , i have the expected ( ? ), 
  aversion to licorice . 
  nothing personal , do n't like the taste much . 
   seems to only be a northern - and western-european thing so far , but i 'd gladly be proven wrong . 
  oh right , i heard that finns apparently put licorice in unlikely things , like ice-cream and stuff . 
  not sure whether that 's in favor of `` licorice is good '' tho , i also heard about that ... m\u00e4mmi thing . 
  kidding . 
  i think licorice is kinda like marzipan , some love it some ca n't stand it . 
  myself , i ca n't get enough of mozartkugeln . 
  i do n't see much of them on our shelves . 
  there you have it , netherlands , new space for exports !, 
   it definitely changed my perspective on some things , reminds me of the fact that we should n't simply take a lot of things for granted here . 
  oh , that 's a long story . 
  in shortest words possible : nobody properly owned anything during communism , and it was recommended that you become a member of the party . 
  so everybody did things half-assed , plus stole potato . 
  the communist pigdogs magically transformed themselves into capitalist pigdogs ( and stole even more stuff while we were distracted by war and viva la revolucion ) . 
  sometime in early 2000 's the mass-theft calmed down , we eventually cleared things up enough to enter eu , and now the electorate is genuinely disinterested about voting ( and those that are , well many of them are the hdz lost-causes , does n't help that our left wing is incompetent ) . 
  brain drain intensified , and nowadays employers have trouble finding qualified workers willing to work for our low ( er ) wages ( does n't help that educational system needs overhaul ) . 
  politburo took most potato already , and they 're getting kinda nervous about the brain drain and the increasingly distressed employers . 
  and then eu is offering handsome money within the funds , the plot twist is that there 's only so much stealing they 'll tolerate . 
  this ends up being a good thing in the end i think , they 'll have to reform some things , up to a point , at least to drain the funds . 
  i think i 'll stick around  my field , it , is mostly corruption-proof anyways ( you actually need to know how to do your job , no place for useless paper-pushers ) . 
   same here , please keep it safe . 
  will do !, 
  also , does n't it go like : men are much more likely to use `` irreversible '' methods than women ? 
  like for example hanging instead of pills . 
  but [ women are generally more likely to attempt it . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gender_differences_in_suicide ) also if i had to guess why we 're comparatively high in europe , yeah the general poverty etc will be a factor , but as to why more men than women , another factor here will be - ptsd , for obvious reasons . 
  wait , are we reading the same article ? 
  the link mentions gender , at least across europe . 
   out of the 4.9 million deaths reported in the european union ( eu ) in 2014 , 58 000 ( 1.2 % ) were due to intentional self-harm . 
  ** almost 8 in 10 suicides ( 77 % ) were committed by men ** and about half ( 48 % ) by a person aged between 40 and 65 . 
   `` bademi u \u0161e\u0107eru '' , almonds with sugar , i think ? 
  almonds in sugar ... this might explain your teeth :p ( too sugary for my taste , brrr . ), 
  as for the hdz rant , that bit about agrokor being the bossiest boss that ever bossed ? 
  well , some of these days it seems to me that half of our politicians went to agrokor for schooling in how to boss your people . 
  naturally , the politicians and the people who actually own stuff are very good friends . 
  like our current finance minister , he was a mini-boss in agrokor up until 2016 . 
  he * claims ignorance * about the denbts . 
  this is why the government almost fell apart recently ... again . 
  i do n't even know how to feel about all that . 
  on one hand , i think we have too many very good friends running the country . 
  on the other hand , bajadera . 
  i do n't want any harm to come to it, 
  we suck , yeaaaah !, 
  actually , apparently we suck a little less than before . 
  ca n't find clear stats of what actually happened so far , but [ prediction is 2,9 % for 2017 ] ( https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-performance-and-forecasts/economic-performance-country/croatia/economic-forecast-croatia_en ) ( and yes , this also adds potential trouble from agrokor ) . 
  real stats for the end of the year/shift to 2017 [ here , 3,4 % . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/croatia/gdp-growth-annual ) also in the first two months , [ imports grew by 7,4 % and exports by 19.12 % ( wtf ? 
  ) ] ( https://www.tportal.hr/biznis/clanak/izvoz-nevjerojatno-raste-iz-hrvatske-izvezeno-20-posto-vise-robe-nego-lani-20170509 ) , so it 's quite likely we 're keeping up with the predicted growth . 
  also tourism rose by [ 20 % apparently ] ( http://www.croatiaweek.com/tourist-arrivals-up-20-in-2017/?doing_wp_cron=1495027331.4378590583801269531250 ) ... we have zimmer frei !!, 
  : ddd, 
  but is n't that the fault of the globalization , instead of eu ? 
  for example , our industry here died in a large part long before we entered the eu . 
  some of it was mismanagement and war , but the rest was `` not being competitive enough '' . 
  for the high-end products , the west muscled us out , for the low-end , that went to china . 
  and this 2nd part ca n't be helped unless we become as cheap as china ( and bangladesh , and vietnam , and etc ) , which is n't feasible . 
  something similar happened everywhere , just look at the devastated rust belt in usa . 
  eh , you 're honorary slavs anyways :p, 
  but you have n't made a counter-argument . 
  you just did the equivalent of shouting `` this is false and you should be ashamed '' , without explaining why it 's false . 
  that 's the definition of `` not contributing to the discussion '' , and on top of that you 're being unpleasant . 
  that 's why you 're getting downvoted . 
  you could have gone on to explain why it is n't feasible that czech buy local products . 
  are they more expensive ? 
  did they get muscled out of the market by eu regulations , or more likely , bigger competitors from the outside ? 
  does czechia simply lack its own products , like for example they have no sea fish of their own cause they 're landlocked ? 
  those would be * contributing * , much better than moralizing sermons . 
  wait , what ? 
  yes , agrokor is our lord and savior , the bossiest boss that ever bossed , resistance is futile . 
  ( even when they crash into `` too many denbts '' , this is why we 'll be rescuing them now , probably with taxes or similar . 
  15 % of our gdp , it 's a plot . ), 
  are you talking about quality ? 
  if you ask me , lidl is perceived as the `` sometimes dubious but mostly cheaper stuff '' , or at least it 's more dubious than what konzum sells . 
  and general stuff from agrokor , like jamnica , ledo etc etc , well we like those , same for the stuff they buy and then re-sell , like for example kra\u0161 . 
  ( try [ bajadera !, 
  ] ( https://image.dnevnik.hr/media/images/1024xx/nov2016/61295114-bajadera-kras-cokolada.jpg ) ) as for the general stuff about quality being lesser here , yeah i 'd say that 's true , why sell better stuff to * peasants * ? 
  but i do n't have the stats for it . 
  meh , le pen was talking nonsense like france having two currencies , euro for business and franc for wages , which would supposedly help in her goal to get an euro-independent currency for france ... how ? 
  also from what i 've seen of her campaigning and debating , it mostly consisted of character attacks at macron , instead of `` an actual program '' . 
  and as pointed out earlier , this bit of `` news '' consists of redistributing immigrants/refugees that are already in overburdened greece . 
  so for those , `` no use crying over split milk '' . 
  i just do n't get why somebody * sensible * ca n't make some stronger plans to deal with `` potentially more milk being split '' , like seriously increasing border protection . 
  they 'd be a runaway success , ode to joy intensifies by 150 % . 
  no but seriously , wars between major forces moved into proxies ( vietnam , middle east , etc etc ) . 
  and the nuke-holders have been careful not to attack each other directly for that reason ( well , each other + major allies like germany ) . 
  plus , the powers that be ^ ^ tm realized that it 's much easier to get disgustingly rich by pigdog capitalism , instead of major anschluss like before . 
  partially because the world has changed , before all you needed is peasants/low-skilled workers to extract value from the land , nowadays you need college-educated engineers ... that you just killed . 
  and replacing them and the destroyed infrastructure takes a lot of time . 
  wwiii simply is n't profitable enough for anyone anymore . 
  ( or at least , up until we destroy the environment to the point where we 're back to the 19th century/mass migration period , which is a moot argument . ), 
  i 'm pretty sure he 's a psychopath ( or sociopath ? 
  i always confuse those two ) , may be also moderately delusional , but not stupid . 
  he can count . 
  he can also test our patience with his statements and behavior , and also blackmail us with `` i 'll release the migrants '' and such . 
  but if we hit back , he 'd know that `` ok , over here is the limit of what they 'll tolerate '' . 
  he has n't yet found that limit , so i guess he 'll keep pushing . 
  what would you do about the ones that are already in greece and italy ? 
  because this whole piece of `` news '' is about re-distributing those that are in greece and italy , which is something that the countries agreed to .
