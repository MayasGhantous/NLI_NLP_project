  we can talk about strengthening borders , merkel 's mistakes and so on until we 're blue in the face , does n't change the fact that greece has whole camps it ca n't take care of . 
  deporting them ? 
  how and where ? 
  it depends on the thread , i think . 
  in this particular one , whatever i say that 's negative about the migrants and eu 's approach is upvoted , while me pointing out that `` stopping them from coming into europe '' is n't actually simple gets downvoted . 
  i wonder how people would feel about me saying that it 's not fair to leave greece and italy overrun ? 
  [ or about the actual quotas . 
  ] ( https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/45bd/production/_88335871_eu_migrant_asylum_quotas_v2_624gr.png ) all this fuss from orban ... feels suspicious . 
  [ like he 's pandering to the electorate , perhaps ? 
  :d ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6biwc2/the_european_commission_threatens_countries_that/dhn8fg2/ ), 
  personally i 'm willing to accept only those fleeing war , and only to a limited extent . 
  if too many of them got in , they 're still unemployed as the war winds down , they do n't even speak the new language , which means they 're not even remotely interested into integrating etc - they 're deported back to their home countries . 
  ( basically , at that point they 're no longer refugees but migrants , and they 're treated by the same migrant-rules as everyone else . ), 
  as for investing in those nations , yes i think it 'll help , but again only to a limited extent . 
  look at the comparatively much smaller disparity between the rich and `` poor '' eu , and how people move to the rich ( er ) countries . 
  ( nobody is actually legit * poor * in europe , except maybe moldova . ), 
  so better border protection and stricter rules will have to happen . 
  this is about relocating those that were already in greece and italy , especially greece , they 're kind of overrun . 
  problems are various conventions on human rights . 
  you ca n't legally deport people back into warzones ... and it 's also difficult to deport them back to countries that refuse to take them back , even if they 're not warzones . 
  theoretically you can slap sanctions on for example libya , but that 'll just probably make the already fragile libyan government fall apart faster ( so then you have a total chaos-country where there 's nobody to sanction ) . 
  as far as i know , eu dropping migrants back into libyan soil would basically work out as `` illegally breaching the territory of libya '' , which is a shade lighter than outright war . 
  also i doubt that european citizens will have the appetite for outright war in the next few decades . 
  ( we do n't like to be inconvenienced by things like dying on some foreign soil . ), 
  but ... 
  i think that some version of fort europa will have to be put into place by 2030-2040 . 
  and that will mean violent fences , deportations , probably the sinking of boats . 
  will make orban 's water canons look minor in comparison . 
  we 're just not there yet mentally . 
  it 's not nonsensical . 
  it 's * mistaken * in this specific issue . 
  that does n't mean that anyone here needs to go drastically doomsday `` eu is dead , no wait eu is dying , let 's kill it we 'll be better off if we kill it ! '', 
  here 's what 's going to happen in the future , regardless of our wishes : + africa keeps drying out under the effects of global warming . 
  its population keeps growing for some time yet . 
  the middle east most likely stays problematic . 
  + europe , in comparison , stays more peaceful and prosperous . 
  ( well , we * could * change that , have n't had a world war for a long time , right friendly neighbors ? ), 
  + obviously the neighbors from africa and middle east try to get into europe ( correction , the richer europe ) . 
  they keep landing into greece and italy . 
  ( or else greece and italy start sinking their boats , because i can see that working out well in terms of politics . ), 
  + greece and italy ca n't keep them . 
  they do n't even want to stay in greece and italy . 
  with eu , greece and italy sort-of have to listen to what eu is saying ( `` keep them in for a while , we 'll help with borders and relocation , * promise * '' ) . 
  without eu , greece and italy have n't been born yesterday , they know the migrants want to leave ... and they just play stupid and let them leave . 
  if you thought 2015 was bad , wait for 2040 and one billion ( ! ), 
  trying to get into europe if something is n't done to alleviate the problems of war and climate change now . 
  and i know that neither croatia nor slovakia can do anything relevant to alleviate these problems on their own . 
  tl ; dr : do n't throw the baby out with the bathwater . 
  but the commission is elected/put into place by the council and the parliament , no ? 
  and both the council and the parliament are elected . 
  council is made of our pm 's / presidents , parliament mep 's we elect directly again . 
  so if anything , we should be asking * them * what gives . 
  if poland and hungary are pressured , then it 's because they 're outvoted by the rest of the eu ... which is n't actually different than the specific regions of my country/populace getting out-voted by the majority . 
  personal anecdote , from a year ago . 
  a friend that works ( worked ? 
  idk , have n't heard from her for a while ) in some german reception center , she finished some anthropology + whatever college majors here , so apparently working with refugees/immigrants is within the scope of her diploma . 
  her reviews are very mixed . 
  she said that cca 1/4 to 1/3 of the people there were from syria , the rest were mostly iraq & co , and many were from africa . 
  her opinion is that around 1/3 of the total number were legit refugees fleeing war ( or a country that 's basically total chaos so it comes to the same thing ) , so around this 1/3 should definitely be helped on a humanitarian basis . 
  those fleeing poverty , well she has the same opinions on those as most of this sub does ( `` we have enough problems as it is '' ) . 
  also ... she said that it 's not unusual that those from the extreme islam countries * refuse to obey her because she 's a woman * . 
  and that this is n't something that 'll be `` fixed '' by positive thoughts about multi-kulti from our side , their culture , their whole worldview , taught them that `` it 's not proper for a woman to be commanding men around '' . 
  also she said that quite a few of those from africa are even worse , because they 're grown-ass men who grew up on the streets , how are you going to do , what , `` re-educate '' them that stealing is wrong and that force is n't a proper solution ? 
  is my friend supposed to be a mother to a 20-year-old men now ? 
  so ... it 's complicated . 
  those that are fleeing war , yes they should be helped , but thinking that it 's going to be as * easy * as teaching them a new language ( which is hard enough as it is ) is irresponsibly naive at best . 
  the migrants ' countries of origin can barely be called `` countries '' . 
  libya does n't even have a government that properly controls the country . 
  syria and iraq , nuff said . 
  pirates and wild west ? 
  same for the sudan 's . 
  let 's say you put sanctions on libya ... either nothing happens , or the barely-there-government falls apart even further . 
  assad ? 
  as if they 're gon na care . 
  the one effective `` deal or threats of sanctions '' that can happen atm is with turkey , and that 's what basically happened in 2015 , they closed their borders and weakened the flow . 
  other options are that we literally invade these countries ( being the 10th or so in line to do it ) and try to establish them as colonies ... again . 
  meh , we actually `` volunteered '' to increase our quota . 
  because we 're not eager to fight windmills here . 
  we know they 'll refuse to come , they 've been refusing to come/stay/even be fingerprinted from the beginning . 
  and since the eu does n't allow we put them into literal prisons , nothing will happen . 
  i mean i 'm just trying to imagine a situation where they 're trying to find jobs and they do n't even speak the language ... bwahahaha . 
  half of the jobs today demand english on top of croatian , some even ask for german and italian on top of * that * . 
  good luck learning croatian for a start !, 
  : '' d the other option is that we have to pay them welfare ... bwahahaah . 
  they 're gon na run away the next day if it comes to accepting our `` welfare '' . 
  or eu pays them * german * welfare to stay here , in which case it 's no skin off our backs ( hmmm our shops may even end up with a net gain ) . 
  idk why orban does n't play stupid like that . 
  trying to imagine them learning * hungarian * ... ohhh god this is even more preposterous than learning croatian , [ you special ugro-finnic snowflake :p ] ( https://dailymagyar.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/kutya_meme_ps.png ), 
  albania is in nato . 
  this stinks of * distraction * from the fact that [ it 's not just `` the opposition '' that 'd like to overthrow vu\u010di\u0107 .

  huh , if it 'll make google translate more accurate , ok . lord knows it 's lame atm ... so many things lost in the harmful translation to english . 
  english does n't even have grammatical cases , that 's most of the sentences not making sense !, 
  also as side-note ... it 'd be neat if such computer tools would `` translate '' different scripts into latin and vice-versa . 
  it did n't `` become '' , we were literally at war with each other a little more than 20 years ago . 
  if anything , it 's been decreasing with time . 
  but the complicated serbia-croatia relations are a strange thing to look at . 
  it 'd be like , idk , saying that usa is `` xenophobic '' because it does n't get along with russians , and vice versa . 
  or russia and ukraine , europe towards russia and turkey , etc etc. 
  there 's prejudice for no good reason , and then there 's `` prejudice '' towards people for actual real ( fresh ) reasons .
