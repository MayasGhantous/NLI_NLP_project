  it does n't just go away after such a short time . 
  and the serb minorities are further complicated by what they - or some other serb minorities in the same area - tried to do in the 90 's . 
  a bit hard to * trust your loving neighbors * after that , you know ? 
  but in any case . 
  we do n't like you much , you do n't like us much . 
  but i do n't think that this makes serbia `` xenophobic in general '' towards non-serbs , i know that you get along well with romanians , greeks etc etc. 
  i just looked up what they 're referring to - the `` patriotic coalition '' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/patriotic_coalition_ ( croatia ) winning 33 % of the vote . 
  except as you can see that was basically hdz and a few other minor seats , same hdz is the run of the mill conservative right-wing party . 
  are we talking the usual pissing contests with serbia or xenophobia in general ? 
  racist ? 
  for heaven 's sake we do n't even have `` races '' here , we 're all white - because no colonies and economic migrants are n't interested in us , except for bosnians , and they all happen to be white ... and sometimes muslim . 
  we get along with them . 
  not that much in detail , sadly . 
  do n't want to cheat with too much checking of wiki , so off the top of my head ... + very small population , a bit more than 300k . 
  it 's basically 3 times my own city , which makes me wonder - how does such a small country function ? 
  though i guess it 's the same question a german or a pole may ask about many european countries , so : shrug : they function well as a country all in all , though of course there are lots of jokes about `` dammit , it 's a cousin * again * '' .

  ] ( https://www.demilked.com/magazine/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/nordic-landscape-nature-photography-iceland-12.jpg ) iirc tourism has been booming recently , and no wonder .

  + one of the last european clays to be settled , right ? 
  < checks  yep , sometime between 770 and 880 ad .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-su_l7mvfok ) + so the earlier bankers ' crisis is very foggy in my mind , but iirc the gist was : greedy bankers took risks they should n't have ( business as usual ) , but then the icelanders * refused * to rescue them by taxes or whatever . 
  which was cool . 
  not sure how the debts were settled in the end ... 
  i think some of the other nordics helped ? 
  or something like that . 
  + tends to rank very high on the lists of `` state of female emancipation and leadership etc '' . 
  + also `` ukraine and latvia were the first to react by recognizing croatian independence in the second week of december . 
  the following week , iceland and germany recognized it , on 19 december 1991 , as the first western european countries to do so . '', 
  [ thanks !, 
  ahh , finally we have a romanian place that sounds weird in croatian !, 
  bogata = rich ( female adjective ) . 
  it 's not on the level of pula , but it 's better than nothing . 
  hm , maybe you should better try the stickied tourist-thread on r/croatia . 
  more likely that someone in-the-know will respond . 
  in general about the camps in croatia : yeah , there are many , i 've been in some around istria and on murter . 
  they 're generally built like : so they have the `` public '' toilets , showers and stuff ( imo there are always plenty in every camp , not like you 'll wait in lines , and they 're regularly cleaned and stuff ) . 
  now we always stayed in those [ stationary caravans ] ( http://www.perthshire-caravans.com/uploads/bg_caravan.jpg ) that 'd have the power , gas and tv connected , but i * think * you can rent a spot for your tent too . 
  never did that , so - you 'll have to ask around further . 
  my theory about the virgin-obsession in general is : virgins are usually younger and therefore probably prettier to such men , plus they do n't have any comparisons to draw . 
  not like she 'll rate you as `` lame lover '' if she does n't know better . 
  well over here the issue would n't be `` racist '' but `` anti-church '' . 
  cause priests are disproportionate among pedophiles , and they 're all white . 
  it 's more about the system not being helpful in protecting against the `` holy cows '' like minorities , racial minorities , churches , the politicians , the rich ( especially the rich ) and so on . 
  not that the system is very helpful to rape victims in general . 
  reminds me of george carlin 's rant on [ soft language . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o25i2fzfgoy ) as coincidence would have it , he mentioned : `` it 's getting so bad that any day now i expect to hear a * rape victim * referred to as * an unwilling sperm recipient * ! '', 
  mm , i do n't feel very happy with how eu/west handled ukraine . 
  i mean i get it , it 's not feasible/logical to send france and russia to war with each other because of ukraine , but on the other hand as far as i 'm aware that whole mess started because ukrainians tried/wanted to get closer to eu and west , turn away from russia . 
  goes to show that we 're not safe/worth it for the border-lands ... and it brings into doubt as to what would happen if vlad tried to `` rescue some oppressed russian minorities '' in the baltics for example . 
  cause i do n't feel that eu/nato would try hard to go to war with russia for the sake of estonia either . 
  as for the non-intervention thing . 
  yes , i usually agree that we should consider distance ... but also : culture and complexity . 
  i feel that the venezuelan problems are much easier to understand than the clusterfuck in the middle east that took the `` top complicated '' award away from the balkans by a mile . 
  like - * who do you even support in syria ? 
  because that worked out well in srebrenica for example . 
  non-intervention is n't always the answer either . 
  you typed that while being raped and robbed simultaneously , have n't you . 
  they probably took your car and goat as well , now you 'll have to go uphill both ways , right . 
  wait . 
  are you even alive at the moment ? 
  based on my totally reliable statistics , you should have been kill after submitting this post . 
  and how so you even have internet ? 
  are you even south african ? 
  am i speaking to a ghost ? 
  or worse , a putin-shill ??!, 
  that 's because `` the other parts of the world '' left the middle ages . 
  easier to `` grow '' when you start from the bottom ( most people living off subsistence farming ) , than when you 've already gone though the industrial revolution . 
  and the gdp/ppp share of the eu in the world will decline further , with our shrinking population , and * their * increasingly industrialized economies and a population finally just catching up in the demographic shift we 've already gone though with the baby boomers . 
  * this is a good thing for the world . 
  * in any case , the falling market share would happen to european countries anyways , with or without the eu . 
  if anything , eu alleviates many of the problems of us euros becoming `` too small for the world '' . 
  depends on where you 're standing . 
  if it was n't for the concepts of nation , religion , culture , self-interest etc etc , over here we 'd be turks now . 
  or italians . 
  or hungarians , they literally tried to turn us into that . 
  or serbs even . 
  and no , we would n't be better off as such . 
  the periphery is always neglected . 
  i do n't think so . 
  share of renewables in 2014 : http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/file:share_of_renewables_in_gross_final_energy_consumption,_2014_and_2020_ ( % 25 ) _ yb16.png so bulgaria , lithuania , romania , estonia , croatia , finland , latvia etc are doing well in renewables and they 're cheap . 
  apparently same goes for norway ( so said the norwegians up in the thread ) . 
  sweden seems to be a mild exception , and then you have cheap and dirty like poland , so it 's probably more affected by taxes and whatever else . 
  well , you also need to consider that uk would n't have the equally special status as it did before . 
  so they 'd be obliged to eventually adopt schengen and euro , and afaik those are quite large issues for them . 
  also , the old folks who voted leave also once upon a time voted to enter - so who knows how the current middle-aged and young will think in 10-20 years . 
  also eu will likely integrate even further in the meantime ( or else fall apart if it does n't ) . 
  not to say that i entirely disagree with you , i could see it happening , but if it does it 'll be much more difficult than it was the 1st time . 
  and yet their government is blocking a common-military eu project that they 're not going to be part of anyways because ... elections ? 
  harming/annoying the eu while they can ? 
  none of which has to do with free trading . 
  i do n't even know . 
  i do n't feel like watching the video again atm , so going off my memory ~ those that are somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd stage , still .
