  so 1st is : many are born , many die . 
  ( most of human history . ), 
  2nd : many are born , few die . 
  ( industrial and agricultural revolutions . ), 
  3rd : explosive growth from the 2nd phase shows up properly , all those * many * are now having their own 2-3 kids , so population keeps growing even though people have 2-3 instead of 5-10 kids like in 1st stage . 
  4th : few are born , few die , population stabilizes . 
  developed world is here atm . 
  negative growth is also not unusual here , because many women ( and men ) simply decide not to have kids at all , at much higher rate than ever before . 
  cause they can afford contraception , and they 'd rather focus on career & etc. 
  but since the population boom already happened , these nations * losing * in numbers is actually closer to going back to population-numbers from the 60 's for example , instead of `` omg this country is gon na die '' . 
  [ no , they wo n't . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsbt5eqt348 ) all countries go though the demographic shift . 
  our baby boomers just happened a few decades earlier than in most asia/africa , but that does n't mean that same asia/africa are n't going though the same shift . 
  for heaven 's sake , china is already done with that , they actually have an aging population atm , same as we . 
  and many go though the shift * faster * than we did - bangladesh took just 20 years to do what lasted 80 over here - better technology , more international aid actually helps . 
  sure but the question was `` why so much abortion in the east if it 's so religious '' . 
  cause those two do n't compute , and yet they work out over here by some impressive mental gymnastics . 
  same people that are against lgtb rights because `` jesus said so '' also proclaim they 're against abortion , and yet they do it ... which is i guess alright if you `` confess '' , and never again think much about the hypocritical behavior . 
  my cat also has a brain . 
  so do the people who get into accidents where they get such brain damage they 're for all purpose just vegetables on life-support , and they 're kept on that life support for years and years , despite the fact that they 'll never get better ( and they 're stressing the healthcare system that 's overstressed enough as it is , and should better help people * that can still be helped * ) . 
  or even worse cases , those that are aware enough to experience unceasing pain , but not aware or capable enough to kill themselves , so their `` loving '' families keep them that way because they ca n't handle pulling the plug . 
  or because `` life is sacred '' , i guess . 
  and in any case : planet earth is overpopulated enough , no pressing need to populate it further . 
  people - women - who are serious enough about abortion to actually do it are not good materials for loving/capable mothers . 
  all those that are most `` concerned '' about the sanctity of human life in the womb should shut up and do * something * about the sanctity of human life once it 's out of the womb , but nooooooo , after you 're born to bad parents or poor parents or too young parents , those `` concerned citizens '' are nowhere to be found . 
  they also like to fight against sex-ed , contraception , women 's rights , * those homogays * , and on and on . 
  i have zero patience for them and their hypocritical behavior . 
  communism , i think . 
  over here , we 're `` deeply '' religious . 
  and equally deeply anti-commie . 
  except when it comes to the useful things that atheist commies did , then we `` feign ignorance '' about the source of said useful thing . 
  oh , that 's not even the worst !, 
  we gave them [ 12 and 12 ] ( http://eurovisionworld.com/?eurovision=2017#hungary ) , [ they gave us 5 !, 
  ] ( http://eurovisionworld.com/?eurovision=2017#croatia ) ... perhaps trianon was n't a total mistake  . <, 
  \\  rome was n't built in a day no but seriously now . 
  i feel that issues such a global warming are much more pressing and relevant than how china runs itself . 
  in fact , if i was asked to choose whether i 'd rather that china was better toward human rights but that meant it 'll deny that climate is something that needs solving now , or a china that 's run by a one-party-system but gets things done , things that affect all of humanity , i 'd go for the 2nd option . 
  because d'oh , worrying the most about `` rights '' when africa is drying out as we speak strikes me as kinda short-sighted . 
  if we do n't do something about climate now , damage in a 100 years will be ... 
  i do n't even want to think about it . 
  and personally , i find china mind-boggling . 
  it 's a country ... with a population bigger than all of europe combined . 
  so it 's kinda closer to a continent from a certain perspective . 
  what i can say about the failures of democracy ( yes , they exist ) is a saying we have here : `` 100 midwives , sluggish baby '' . 
  basically , you have a problem when you have a 100 sides all trying to protect their own interests , and these interests do n't align - * and so nothing gets done * . 
  so i do n't even know whether the western-style democracy would work on a country the size of china . 
  that does n't mean that they should n't reach for more human rights , less censorship etc ( though i think me , and europe in general , looks at censorship of * harmful * things a bit more relaxedly than usa ) , but ... if or when they reach a better system , i think it 'll have to : a ) come from the inside , so no westerners pushing their norms on china as if one size fits all , and b ) it 'll be adapted to china specifically . 
  / u/trolokr wrote from a chinese perspective on that [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/67b7sx/eu_foreign_policy_chief_mogherini_euchina/dgp7ku0/ ) , it 's an interesting read . 
   do you like the city you live in ? 
  do you feel it 's accessible and vibrant ? 
  pretty much , yeah . 
  i 'm talking osijek specifically . 
  that is , it 's quite small by western standards ( barely pushing 100k people , and that 's with all the university students and commuters from surrounding villages added ) , and economy is fairly lame , even for croatian standards , plus in such a small city you 'll automatically have * less * of everything , like concerts and such events . 
  but on the other hand , i live in a suburb that has the best of all worlds - i 'm a little more than half an hour away by ( slow ! ), 
  public tram from the center of the city , and on the other hand i have my big garden , pretty big house ( for cheap ) , peace and quiet ... to the point that i can play moderately loud rock music at 3 am and disturb absolutely no one . 
  and yet i 'm close to `` everything relevant '' , first convenience store is 5 minutes of walking away , first bar is literally 7 houses away . 
  and the city has wide streets , dozens of big parks , mostly low buildings and houses so the sun is n't blocked , [ nice places to take a walk ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=osijek+promenada&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjgqbe-gvdtahurb8akhdj3blaq_auicigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818&amp;dpr=1.13 ) . 
  from what i 've seen of zagreb , it 's much busier ( obviously , it 's 10 times the size ) , but similar still applies to the tram convenience and parks . 
  coastal cities feel more hectic ( too hectic for my taste ) , but then again they were built between mountains and sea , and they 're overrun by tourists whenever i visit in the summer . 
  side-note : so i visited prague , budapest , p\u00e9cs , vienna , stuttgart - and they felt the same ( geee i wonder why ! ) . 
  venice less so , but then again - tiny streets , too many tourists . 
  the one exception was athens which felt more like `` wild west '' to me ... though the rest of greek cities/towns i 've been to , like kalabaka , did n't . 
  as for the chinese that come here , my impression of the few i ran into is : they mostly keep to themselves but do n't make trouble . 
  so i doubt that there 'd be problems with them like with some of the non-integrated muslims in the west getting radicalized . 
  they even sound the same !, 
  ( i do n't mix them up usually , as far as i 'm aware , australia never ruled us . ), 
  ok then . 
  in my view , denmark , greece , germany , poland , belgium and uk had the `` woman in a pretty dress singing a pop song '' , netherlands added 2 more women . 
  ( france gets a pass cause it was mostly in french , and i thought it sounded more interesting even without that . ), 
  israel , austria , australia and cyprus had `` handsome man singing a pop song '' , sweden iirc added more handsome men . 
  as a side-note , norway was at least interesting to me , it was n't a pop-ballad ( rarity , sadly ) and the staging did something different . 
  and so the people have spoken ~ ** make rap-yodeling a thing !, 
  that 's my problem with most of the songs on the right side of this graph . 
  they 're not good . 
  they 're not bad . 
  [ they 're not so bad they 're glorious . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjhjnevone ) if you played austria and australia to me right now , and did n't tell me which is which , i probably would n't be able to tell either . 
  i feel like the same handsome-dude cardboard cut-out sang half a dozen ? 
  different safe and bland pop-songs with other handsome dudes dancing in the background . 
  and do n't let me even started on performances that mostly consisted of `` nice boobs in a white dress ... 
  half-dress ( ? ) '' . 
  i 'd like to hear an eurovision which is n't a copy of the american idol , is my point . 
  i mean at least you could make it * european * idol !, 
  i * think * there was some more political stuff around the [ agrokor crisis ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69q8q6/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20170507/dh8rkf4/ ) , but nothing interesting . 
  more importantly !, 
  [ ** we made new memes !, 
  ** ] ( https://imgur.com/gallery/eef2x ) also our yugoslav/balkan/austro-hungary / venice neighbors mostly [ made themselves utterly useless by jury ( politicians ) , but useful by the televote ( the people ) . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xibiirm.png ) see , this is why we left a-h and yugoslavia !, 
  but * the people * are welcome to visit . 
  one joke-y explanation i heard about the difference between europe and usa is :  in europe , they think 100km is a long way . 
  in america , they think 100 years is a long time . 
  it 's snarky , but i think it encapsulates quite a few differences in the thinking and culture . 
  one `` strange '' thing i noticed about my internet american friends - they move around * a lot * . 
  it 's not uncommon for them to drive hundreds of kilometers to visit family for thanksgiving ( and here i mean : mom and dad from both sides , nevermind something more distant like cousins ) , same goes for packing up every few years because they change jobs a lot , but unlike us , these jobs will be scattered around , same for colleges etc. 
  so , obviously it 'll be more difficult ( and useless ) to try to build `` a community '' within your street , block , city . 
  it 's like ... usa was built by nomads who were looking for a better life ( and i think their focus on career and individualist `` fuck da police , do n't trust the government '' comes from that ) , and they sort-of kept that nomad identity . 
  while europe is much more sedentary and perhaps ... patient ? 
  both in terms of all this moving around , taking risks for the sake of career or just thrill of it ( which is n't entirely a good thing , we 're sometimes a bit too passive imo ) , but also the way we look at politics , culture , history . 
  i get the strange sense of ... well , empires come and go , structures come and go , etc etc. 
  and i get the impression - from those same american friends panicking about donald trump - that they take various changes much more seriously ( the less-passive thing ) .
