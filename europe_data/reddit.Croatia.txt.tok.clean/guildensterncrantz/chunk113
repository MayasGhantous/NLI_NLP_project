  like , ok so trump won , that 'll have effects . 
  meanwhile , in the last 100-or-so years , my country went through monarchy , another monarchy , fascism , communism , and finally democracy + capitalism . 
  and this within austro-hungary , yugoslavia , independence , and finally eu . 
  so i 'm like `` whatever , business as usual , the more things change the more they stay the same '' at many of the shitfs . 
  if that makes sense . 
  another maybe-distinct european thing is the way many euros [ punch above their weight , ] ( https://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2015/03/15.png ) but i think usa inherited that ( look at everything they accomplished in the last few centuries ) , and in any case i think a lot of that comes from our convenient geography , native animals ( you can do a lot more with horses and pigs than bisons and llamas ) and so on , so not sure how much that applies . 
  oh it was different for sure , but so were hungary , romania and moldova . 
  even croatia was `` distinctive '' ( whether it was quality music all in all is another thing , vocals were obviously impressive , the rest is dubious ) . 
  and yet they were treated quite badly by the jury ( except for moldova , and even they were n't at the top 5 ) , so the argument that portugal won because it 's distinctive does n't hold to me . 
  then there 's the [ disparity between jury and public for us . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xibiirm.png ) a bunch of those - 56 out of 103 public votes - are n't even balkan , so you ca n't even say that the public vote was excessively `` balkan block '' . 
  in any case , it was n't any more regional or political than cyprus and greece or uk and australia ( etc. . . ) in the jury . 
  popular only : portugal 376 bulgaria 337 moldova 264 belgium 255 romania 224 italy 208 hungary 152 sweden 126 croatia 103 france 90 azerbaijan 42 poland 41 belarus 33 cyprus 32 norway 29 greece 29 ukraine 24 armenia 21 netherlands 15 uk 12 denmark 8 israel 5 spain 5 germany 3 australia 2 austria 0, 
  oh he was outrageously fabulous ~ and i un-ironically think those crazy high notes are more interesting to hear than the samey-same pop , and interesting music and maybe-music should be the point of contests like this one ( if i want safe and easily digestible music , i 'll browse the top 10 popular lists ) , buuuut i 'm not sure that the people who know more about `` music and diversity and quality '' would agree with me . 
  i am a simple redditor . 
  i hear rap-yodeling or a gypsy dude singling/rapping in hungarian/romani ~ i call 6 times for each < 3, 
   the only song that did n't follow the eurovision formula would win hungary would like a word . 
  it was generic pop . 
  if i did n't know i was watching eurovision , i 'd say `` turn off the american idol , will you ? '', 
  and that 's not just the netherlands , i watched both semis this year and i 'd say half of these songs were forgettable generic pop . 
  neither good , [ nor so bad it 's good ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov3xp5zxsya ) , certainly not memorable or interesting or in any way `` celebrating diversity '' . 
  first step in fixing some of the damage would be forcing countries to sing in their native language ( just subtitle the damned thing and there goes the ireland/uk advantage ) . 
  ok , portugal won both the jury and the people , that 's fair . 
  bulgaria was doing well with both , ok . 
  the rest is bullshit by jury . 
  they 're supposed to be there to make sure that `` quality '' gets through ? 
  or better yet , to give unbiased voting outside of blocks ? 
  so why the hell did the quality jury ^ tm make sure that greece gave 12 to cyprus and australia 12 to uk ? 
  [ this is the state of the points after jury . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/7frs1wl.png ) note that france , croatia , hungary and romania are in the 2nd half . 
  also note that in the 1st half , you have azerbaijan ( 42 from the public ) , norway ( 29 ) , netherlands ( 15 ) , uk ( 12 ) , denmark ( 8 ) , australia ( 2 !, 
  ) , austria ( ** 0 points from the public , 93 from the jury ** ) . 
  [ this is the state of the points after the public vote is added to the jury . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/2umizjr.png ) croatia got ... 25 points from the jury , 103 ( ! ), 
  from the public . 
  romania ... 58 from jury , 224 from the public . 
  ( * the people have spoken , make yodel-rap a thing !, 
  * ) hungary ... 48 from jury , 152 from the public . 
  what the actual fuck !, 
  be less obvious in your politics !, 
  here too . 
  iirc it was 12 for hungary again . 
  thanks for nothing guys !, 
  if you 'll go for ballads , bulgaria was better imo . 
  yes , you 're welcome hungary . 
  thanks for nothing . 
  ukraine is a better ( non ) neighbor than you !, 
  bah , whole balkan is n't voting for itself . 
  because as we all know there 's no political voting in eurovision ... that explains hungary being so low . 
  have unlimited calls this month so i used all 20 ~ azerbaijan , armenia moldova x2 belarus x4 hungary and romania x6 i expect the popular vote will go to ballads and stuff like that , so \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  yes but sax guy first showed up years ago , during the time the yodel girl was still in primary school ~ the newness of memes matters !, 
  rap yodeling because : why not ? 
  hungary or romania ( memes will vote for epic sax guy anyways ) but then hungary, 
  ok either my musical taste is backwards , or there 's something more afoot here ~ why is for example italy favored over france ? 
  i get it in the case of for example bulgaria , ballads are n't my thing , but i can recognize that the kid has perfectly pinch-able cheeks and that he sings * very * well . 
  but i do n't get why italy in particular . 
  the ghost of harambe ? 
  ( lyrics that i do n't understand anyways ? ), 
  i like it both ironically and un-ironically . 
  ironically because , well , that should be obvious . 
  un-ironically because it 's catchy , generally sounds good , and i think yodeling is a 100 times more interesting and `` muh diversity '' than the usual bland pop-ballads . 
  omg i learned english by watching friends too !, 
  20 years instead of 3 weeks ago !, 
  ** he 's one of us ~ **, 
  or our jacques :p, 
  i thought it would n't work when i heard your song will be in hungarian . 
  not what i 'd call a musical language ( alright , we think your accent ? 
  inflection ? 
  is weird/silly af ) . 
  but it works out very well in the song , imo , 
  i 'm almost evenly and ( un ) ironically split between hungary and romania , and then armenia and belarus . 
  ( i expect none of them will win . ), 
  so i did some maths and divided my 20 votes among them , bless the multiple voting !, 
  ( it still works for the finale , right ? 
  idk i 'm half watching on tv , half on youtube , halp pls ), 
  i mean , i think he sang it well ? 
  but i probably have no understanding of ballads , cause this just makes me snooze ... 
  he 's of roma descent , yep, 
   `` it 's like a love machine ''  `` but for facts ! '', 
  yep . 
  we pretty much write as we speak , same as you , but we do n't even have exceptions like for example your v is f ( at the beginning of the word iirc ? ), 
  and such . 
  \u010c and \u0106 are pretty much the same sound ( \u0106 is less harsh ) , same for \u0110 and d\u017e ( first sound in english jean ) , \u017d is first in french jean . 
  nj is the nyet thing , and lj ... hmm . 
  [ apparently only slavs use it like that ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_latin-script_digraphs#l ) , but from skimming that article , portuguese lh is the same . 
  portugal cara ** lh ** o !, 
  so , now you know everything you 'll need to read the road-signs when visiting < 3 edit : ** nula . 
  the slavonia bit is probably correct , [ slavonia ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/austria_hungary_ethnic.svg/1280px-austria_hungary_ethnic.svg.png ) is a region in croatia , had separate kingdom/autonomous status at various times . 
  \\* cries in yugoslavian *, 
  look , i 'm not submitting myself to the torture of looking for the chart-toppers . 
  [ this one is among the few i can tolerate , and iirc it was popular for donkey ages ~ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adc0rpkuqcy ), 
  just in case you were wondering , '' \u010d '' is `` tsch '' . 
  `` nj '' is the same as the first sound in `` nyet '' . 
  we used to do that too , our dora contest , stopped in the last few years . 
  and it 's a good thing that countries do n't send something like `` topped the charts this year '' , you 'd end up with turbo-folk from balkan :o ( or maybe worse in our case in some of these past years - thompson ), 
  hm , now i wonder if the other ex-yugos will give us some traditional votes . 
  you never know which year they 'll forget the * good * traditions ... 
  them and some comedy votes is what we can maybe count on , i think . 
  but you 've been doing lamely for the last few years , no ? 
  and i do n't think it 's crap , just ... forgettable .
