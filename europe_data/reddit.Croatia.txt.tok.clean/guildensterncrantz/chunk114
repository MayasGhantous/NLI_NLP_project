  same as at least half of the songs in this contest . 
  so i 'll spare my votes for those that i like ( or remember ) . 
  italy , portugal and bulgaria i think . 
  personally - i like italy well enough , but i think armenia/hungary are better , and i 'm not a fan of yet another ballad winning ( sorry , most entries ) . 
  and i 'd like romania winning ( not that it 'll happen ) for the same reason ( s ) i wanted lordi winning , the funzies factor . 
  i heard it before , that song is almost a meme . 
  never knew i have eurovision to thank for that , though . 
  ohhh how could i forget !, 
  [ a whole bunch of you had her posters in your room , did n't you :p ] ( https://youtu.be/tda1oyy0lf0?t=1m9s ) side-note : the song is titled `` let 's get crazy '' ( this night ) . 
  written in ' 90 , the irony ~, 
  yeah ... afaik it 's gotten more expensive recently , at least in cities ( like zagreb for example , around 1/4 of us live there ) . 
  just thought the disparity may be because it 's less expensive here . 
  uhm ... cars , well usually you get at least one car per family , and they 're not exactly porche , but it 's not uncommon to see mercedes among the rich , and from what i 've seen travelling in europe ( like greece , who 's apparently much richer than we are ) , middle class cars are comparable . 
  ( prices do n't vary that much , do n't they ? ), 
  then it 's not uncommon to have some extra plot of land in the suburbs . 
  err ... maybe it 's the lack of savings ? 
  idk . 
  but just looking at the whole eastern block where home ownership is rather common , i do n't know what to make of this map . 
  ukraine does n't make sense . 
  well ireland and uk had an unfair advantage before . 
  mind you , i 'd like it more if we returned to native languages as well , the songs are samey-same enough even without being in english . 
  just subtitle them and problem solved . 
  norway , it 's not nice to tease the lower-peaked countries like that . 
  ( did n't you promise some peak to poor finland , and then decided to not deliver in the end ... ? ), 
  ca n't decide . 
  i 'm split between [ every way that i can ] ( https://youtu.be/axjt-rw2urg?t=40s ) , [ nocturne ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pgsx9kljxw ) and [ lejla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlin3mcsh4 ) . 
   in romania 95 % of the people own their home . 
  something similar here , but that also may be because our houses/apartments are n't as expensive . 
  seriously the folks that move from here to for example ireland get vertigo from the unreal housing prices . 
  also , our `` wealth '' is probably affected by the fact that we tend to stay with parents until we can afford to buy ( not rent ! ), 
  our own house/apartment . 
  so atm i 'm living with grandma , and if i do n't have to move away from this city ( and i do n't marry ) , i 'll most likely inherit her house , but on paper i own ... nothing . 
  it 's ... complicated . 
  for one thing , we 're supposed to give 2 % of gdp to nato , and most are failing even that . 
  i 'd say that the general mood among most eu citizens is n't very interested in spending money on military , period . 
  ( obviously that 's different in the border-countries with aggressive neighbors like greece , poland , romania , baltics . ), 
  so , we 'd need to spend even more than those 2 % on some eu-army , which would be tough to sell to the electorate what with the high youth-unemployment etc. 
  or , we 'd need to * leave * nato , which would be even tougher to sell . 
  and it 's not just about money ( usa takes the disproportionate burden of spending ) , but also general logistics like army training , reorganizing the equipment etc. ... 
  i think it 'd take at least a few years to shift , and we 'd be probably vulnerable during those years . 
  and trump wo n't be a president forever . 
  on the other hand , it 's not just about trump . 
  usa had dubious military `` interventions '' in the middle east and further ( like vietnam ) for a while now . 
  and sure trump will go eventually , but him getting elected on a platform of `` america first ! '', 
  ( and many illogical statements ) shows some worrying trends among the american people . 
  those that voted for trump who was talking nonsense like `` we 're gon na build a wall and make mexico pay for it ! '', 
  wo n't just go away in 4 years ... and that makes usa not-reliable-enough , in my mind . 
  and in any case , nato is mostly led by usa , most of the rest of us are mostly just accessories . 
  that means that europe as a whole ( except for russia ) is far too reliant on outside forces . 
  and the kicker is , we do n't * need * to be , while our separate armies are far too small and weak , iirc if you properly put us together ( so , integrating the needs and resources ) , we 'd have the 3rd largest army in the world . 
  so at least , we could defend ourselves if there was a need . 
  mind you , in any case , i do n't see many eu citizens being interested in anything more than defense . 
  so no `` adventurism '' in the middle east , being the `` world police '' and stuff like that . 
  um , sorry , but seriously now ~ various incarnations of a-h were better to us than venice/italy . 
  not that you lot were * all bad * or anything like that , at least you were kinda useful against ottomans , but a-h got us by politicking , venice by war . 
  one of our poets even wrote a fake-sad song when venice fell   it got so annoying that ragusa ( dubrovnik ) ceded a strip of coast to ottomans to protect self from venice ... and this is why bosnia has that troublesome panhandle on the adriatic a few centuries later . 
  mind you , you built some neat things at least . 
  [ including the very first fancy hotel in 305 ad !, 
  tbh if you asked me whether i 'd rather wear a scarf because * it 's expected * , or rather spend way too many hours and too much money on hair-dressers , makeup , a truckload of different clothes , dieting , high heels , and oh !, 
  hair removal is by far the worst ( grandma tells me of the old days where women were n't expected to remove all the hair that 's not on their head , sounds like far less painful days ... ) . 
  well , i might choose the damned scarf . 
  mind you , that depends on whether it 's `` expected '' or `` absolutely obligatory '' . 
  but it 's not like the cultured west does n't put insidious pressure on women as well . 
   ** nowadays ** only woman of older age ( grandmothers ) wear full head coverings . 
  some english speakers use the word `` babushka '' ( the word for ` grandma ' in russian : about this sound \u0431a\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 ( help \u00b7 info ) ) to indicate a headscarf tied below the chin , as still commonly worn in rural parts of europe . 
  in many parts of europe , headscarves are used mainly by elderly women and this led to the use of the term `` babushka '' , a slavic word meaning ` grandmother ' . 
  of course not , europe is a geographical term . 
  uk has n't sailed off to the other side of the atlantic ( yet ) . 
  now , whether there 's such a thing as a `` common european identity '' that exists without political unions like the eu , that 's another debate entirely . 
  your ancestors , not you personally . 
  you could have been born elsewhere ... and you had nothing to do with that `` decision '' . 
  that is , unless you think we can all somehow take * active * credit for what our ancestors did . 
  i love it how both you and / u/jacob-rees-mogg are focusing on the analogy at the end of the comment , instead of the main arguments before it . 
  that bit about common projects , the difficulty around `` quitting '' once they 've already started , uk still being in eu until 2019 at least , you know ? 
  if you have some arguments about quitting projects once they 're half-way done , same projects that the uk pledged to support in the planning stages ... actually , no , i lost my patience already , you do n't have to bother . 
  thanks for the downvotes . 
   there is no legal liability towards future eu spending after we have left . 
  you have n't left yet . 
  and that 's not how it works in the first place . 
  eu funds are agreed upon not on a month-to-month or year-to-year basis , but longer periods like 2014-2020 . 
  after the funds are agreed , they 're delivered to various projects all over the eu . 
  imagine what would happen if you cut them off in the middle of some bridge being built ? 
  this is more similar to uk paying the cinema ticket , leaving in the middle of the movie , and then asking for a refund . 
  eh , based on my observations of reddit , the people most worried about the political and financial future of europe usually dwell on t_d . 
  eh , how much does gold actually help ? 
  you get these notes `` gold gifted to this account/subreddit paid for x hours of server time '' ... the kicker is , by that they mean * one * server . 
  ( or else askreddit would have paid off the bills for the next century . ), 
  i heard that gold pays for comparatively little , most of the money is in ads . 
  see , you should have stayed for the yodeling rap , the pop-opera self-duet , norway addressing the personality disorder in the self-duet as the next song ( `` i kill the voices in my head '' ) , european destiny 's child , and so on . 
  and armenia and hungary actually had decent entries imo , which is respectable ( this is eurovision ) . 
  but is n't that tradition everywhere ? 
  eurovision is simultaneously the best and worst contest in the world , and this is why it must stay :p, 
  checked r/croatia , there it is . 
  [ i love the speed of memes in this modern world ;d ] ( https://twitter.com/bbceurovision/status/862757615318773760 ), 
  were you the one who said he 'll yodel in his sleep ? 
  [ in any case , just so you do n't forget :p ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lldzark8fsm ), 
  i thought the 2nd semi was much better than 1st . 
  only a few songs i could say i liked in 1st ( armenia comes to mind ) , a whole lot of bland pop-ballads . 
  2nd at least had some fun/differences - hungary , belarus , romania , our self-duet :d, 
  me and myself and the violinists passed ( \uff89 \u25d5 \u30ee \u25d5 ) \uff89 * : \uff65 \uff9f \u2727 \u2727 \uff9f \uff65 : * \u30fd ( \u25d5 \u30ee \u25d5 \u30fd ),
