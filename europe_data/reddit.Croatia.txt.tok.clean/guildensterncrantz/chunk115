  my national tv said 20, 
  so now i voted for hungary , belarus and romania a bunch of times , and i 'll be personally salty if they do n't go through !, 
  especially hungary . 
  the rap at the end was a bit awkward , but otherwise a cool performance . 
  and thankfully not in english . 
  called `` my friend '' . 
  that 's like the definition of forever alone, 
  ohhh come on it 's better than the billionth bland pop ballad i forget as soon as it 's done . 
  if we ca n't get * good * songs ( like [ bosnian lejla ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlin3mcsh4 ) for example ) , may as well have fun :p, 
  destiny 's children edit : omg it 's ** child ** !, 
  ca n't believe i forgot o.o, 
  \\  `` well why not ? '', 
  oh , his voice is great , that 's for sure . 
  it 's the rest that i have doubts about ... not just the lyrics , but also how the performance will go . 
  just look at what these idiots did with nina last year  . <, 
  so about our song . 
  ... i do n't even know what to say or think . 
  * yes * , jacques is singing `` my friend '' to himself in two different voices and languages . 
  make of that what you will, 
  haha , i heard . 
  it 's one of the few lists where germany somehow miraculously manages to be even worse than we are , and lord knows we 're lame \\ ^ ^ and yeah , the whole nato thing would be a problem in regards to the eu army project . 
  most of us are in nato , and as far as i know most want to keep it that way . 
  so ... would that mean 4 % total ? 
  or somehow just integrating whatever sad remains are left after the 2 % ? 
  idk . 
  but it 's a common example of a problem , many say that it 'd be * nice and wise * if europe could take care of itself and not depend on usa so much ... implementation , however , is nowhere near . 
  so the basic idea is : everyone and their grandmother can tell that eu is n't properly functioning atm . 
  some want more integration , others want less , and it 's not even entirely split into west vs east , more depends on the particular issues , for example iirc denmark is very much against the euro , while poland for example would want more army-integration . 
  so many of the projects fall though because one or several members perpetually drag their feet , in which case it 's not fair to strong-arm them into something they do n't want , but it 's also not cool for those that would want to integrate further . 
  ok , so far so good . 
  that makes sense , eu needs reforming but trying to strong-arm the reluctant would split it at the seams . 
  but as you say , the picture is n't entirely clear . 
  the 4 freedoms will stay for all , cause they 're the foundation . 
  ** but what about the money ? 
  ** would this lower/slower tier get punished for not being part of whatever project x ? 
  and i do n't mean `` direct '' sanctions , but let 's say that simply , though some time , most of the current eu development funds get redirected towards projects xyz . 
  but more importantly than that ( cause well , if you refuse to be part of whatever project , obviously you wo n't get the money for that project ) , ** will it just be a matter of goodwill ? 
  ** from what i can tell , merkel & co love to coach the issue in gentle terms like `` coalitions of the willing '' . 
  but let 's be realistic for a moment , and imagine that project z needs a certain level of infrastructure , workforce , etc etc , and if you do n't have those , you ca n't be part of it regardless of * wishes * . 
  just a basic example , let 's say the eu army needs 2 % of gdp given to it ... germany has money to spare and can afford those 2 % , we do n't have money to spare , at all . 
  or for another example , the renewable energy issue . 
  well croatia has yet more untapped hydro , solar and wind to put into gear , we 're almost at 30 % now and * i guess * we could go up to 50 % in the next decade ... poland or czechia , not so much . 
  and more examples like that . 
  i do n't think the eu has been very clear about what 2 speed will actually mean in practice , so i 'm withholding judgement . 
  imo it could be salvation for the whole block ... or it could be yet another way to make the divisions in europe not just a fact in practice , but also further * legalized on paper * . 
  it 's all the gastarbeitern !, 
   im sorry , the tabling is not working ??!, 
  * have you tried turning it on and off ? 
  ;d * here 's how : add [ res ] ( https://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) to your desktop browser . 
  ( if you 're on mobile , i do n't know . 
  but in my wise opinion , modding on mobile is an exercise in moderate insanity anyways . ), 
  res saved my sanity and formatted so many walls of text into something readable , it 's the best invention since automoderator ( who , legends say , lowered the mod mortality by 98 % ) . 
  in res , you have neat gimmicks such as user-tagging ( remember the trolls !, 
  ) , big editor , live preview , and source . 
  source should show up as a little button beneath people 's comments and posts , you can see how they formatted the text . 
  so you can just basically copy what op did . 
  or make your own table by instructions [ from here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting ) & nbsp ; \\* if turning it on and off does n't help , you should contact the admins . 
  * \\* jiggly tune *, 
  except i just cited `` article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of `` sufficient resources ... not to become a burden on the social assistance system '' . '', 
  i can pack up and go to ireland right now . 
  if i do n't find a way to take care of myself there within 3 months , i 'm done , ireland wo n't pay me benefits , that 's absurd , literally all of our unemployed here would just permanently resettle there if it was true ( they 're an army ) . 
  what actually happens is that people move , try to find some decent job , most find it , but if they do n't , they move back . 
  ( the other option is to be homeless in the streets , and in that case it 's better to move back here into mom 's house . ), 
  permanent residence without conditions applies only after you 've stayed there for 5 years , and you ca n't stay longer than 3 months if you do n't get a job within those 3 months . 
  / u/lookingfor3214 showed an example of another loophole [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6aewiw/swiss_limit_immigration_from_bulgariaromania/dherni0/ ) in any case  you have free movement of people and goods . 
  does n't sound that simple to me . 
  there 's those that work or study or just travel like tourists , and then there are the unemployed . 
  if we equaled people to goods , the workers and students would be the equivalent to wares you sell in supermarkets , the welfare tourists would be closer to ... garbage . 
  i seriously doubt we can dump our garbage wherever in the eu and make the other country take care of it . 
  hm , that assumes that we 'd all share the same concerns . 
  to add us up to the size of germany , you 'd need ... bulgaria , croatia , czechia , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , romania , slovakia , slovenia ... also finland , sweden , denmark . 
  that 's roughly equal to germany ( a bit larger ) . 
  to get up to germany + france , you also need to add austria , belgium , cyprus , greece , ireland , luxembourg , malta , netherlands , portugal . 
  the leftovers are spain , italy and poland , large countries . 
  so we could throw out a lot of the smaller fish that i added to the first two lists if us small fish could somehow mobilize spain , italy or poland to fight for our cause ... but then we 're back to the beginning . 
  ca n't help ourselves , begging for someone to intercede . 
  and in any case , many of those on the list are `` europoors '' , including poland ( biggest user of eu funds ) , and spain and italy do n't have a voice compared to france ( even though italy has a similar population to france ) . 
  * in practice * , the big/rich have more right to decide where this ship is going . 
  ( for example , eu council is made of 28 - 27 - `` equal '' members . 
  but my pm is never going to disagree much with what the bigger ones want . ), 
  so this parliament ... the higher representation just makes sure we 're * mostly * powerless in practice , not * absolutely * . 
  ninja edit : i think it 's kinda similar to your electoral college . 
  it started out that way because the `` fly over '' states were scared of the coasts , right ? 
  only unlike the eu , i think you could do away with it now - you 've been a * real * country for centuries . 
  ok , either i 'm too tired to think this late , or something does n't make sense . 
  could someone explain the whole welfare system in regards to the 4 freedoms ? 
  so in the article :  the swiss cabinet was particularly concerned that a high proportion of workers took on seasonal work with above-average unemployment rates . 
  this could result in immigrants working for short periods and then drawing unemployment benefits for the remainder of their stay . 
  ok , that 's a valid concern . 
  but i 've just skimmed the 4 freedoms article on wiki ( free movement of persons ) , in it :  second , article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in another member state , whether economically active or not . 
  ** article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of `` sufficient resources ... not to become a burden on the social assistance system '' . 
  ** articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions . 
  then example :  however , in dano v jobcenter leipzig , the court of justice held that the german government was entitled to deny child support to a romanian mother who had lived in germany for 3 years , but had never worked . 
  because she lived in germany for over 3 months , but under 5 years , she had to show evidence of `` sufficient resources '' , since the court reasoned the right to equal treatment in article 24 within that time depended on lawful residence under article 7 . 
  so this woman that did n't work for 3 years ( ! ) . 
  how come she * was n't * `` a burden on the social assistance system '' , if she was n't working for 3 years in a row ? 
  that 's the definition of a burden , she should n't have been allowed to stay after her 3 months were up . 
  as far as i can tell , the whole free movement thing basically translates to : random tourists etc can move freely , those that stay over 3 months need to get a job , obviously .
