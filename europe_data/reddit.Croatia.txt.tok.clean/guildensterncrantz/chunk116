  if they do n't , the state has room to not pay them to be welfare tourists ( and send them back ) . 
  and by getting a job , should n't a sane country also have room to avoid those that work obvious `` 1 month jobs '' to try to abuse the system ? 
  or , how is `` sufficient resources '' even defined ? 
  i mean ... by any logic , if you 're out of job for so long that you 're asking for welfare , you 're a burden by default . 
  and if you want to stop them from `` taking the jobs '' in general , unless you 're uk or ireland , you have a pretty easy loophole . 
  demand at least b levels of native-to-country language . 
  for heaven 's sake , basically every job i 'm looking at in croatia right now is asking for english at a certain level , if i did n't know english , i could forget about it . 
  i 'm trying to imagine someone forcing our employers to hire anyone who does n't even know croatian ... bwahahaha . 
  that 's not how the free market works , employers can make up the rules as they like . 
  ( the state does n't hire translators either , so good luck functioning in a society you do n't understand . ), 
  ( my whole cunning plan with this : if you limit it to those who know german/french/etc , obviously they 'll be fairly highly educated , so they are unlikely to be burdens . ), 
  not a local , but - idk how informative your brochures are , so : do n't be drunk or hungover when climbing up to meteora . 
  there 's only so far the car/bus will take you , there 's quite a lot of climbing to get to the top ( bring water , have a hat , sensible shoes , etc etc ) . 
  also , see if you can find this [ neat room ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=meteora+ossuary&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewio3-ozkobtahufccakhu6law0q_auibigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818 ) , it 's an ossuary . 
  when i visited , the room was n't exactly open to tourists , we sort of noticed the scene though a small-ish gap/window in the door , so ... surreptitiously check likely doors ? 
  :d also , if you 're going south from meteora , you could make a pit-stop in [ delphi . 
  ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/place/delphi/@38.2758556,22.6214496,9.22z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x135f795df629b6f1:0xca3bdfa3b97e9054!8m2!3d38.4823868!4d22.5009699 ) i thought it was almost as interesting as the acropolis , 
  well theoretically half of croatia is in a crisis . 
  cause our industry sells a lot to agrokor , who resells it though konzum for example , and now agrokor is having trouble paying up to the suppliers ... some of them blocked the delivery of new wares a while back , sort of a nuclear option of `` pay denbts '' ( afaik it 's all been unblocked since then ) . 
  and can you give me more tl ; dr info on mercator ( do n't feel like investigating a lot on my own ) ? 
  what i know is that it was ( is ) big , also had a lot of debts , so that 's how agrokor strong-armed them into the sale ( `` we 'll pay off your debts and you 'll give us the company '' ) . 
  and iirc slovenians were n't very happy about that . 
  so ... that debt could have been restructured somehow ? 
  if the parliament was proportional to population , smaller eu states may as well not show up , because they 'd be absolutely steamrolled by germany and france . 
  ( most eu countries have small population , so that 's most of us not showing up . ), 
  and germany and france are the actual leaders - in practice !, 
  - of the eu whose voices matter so much more than what pipsqueaks like us want , so the uneven representation in favor of the smaller countries is the best compromise possible . 
  eu can do away with that , make it actually `` fair '' , once eu becomes an actual country where the periphery wo n't be neglected . 
  ( so , sometime around 2100 , or never . ), 
  hm , if it was up to our leaders , they 'd do anything to keep their powers as they are . 
  or increase them . 
  ( unless they were bribed otherwise , it 's always about money for them . ), 
  on the other hand , if the eu coached it in terms `` so would you like to hit the eternal hdz-sdp where it hurts , the parliament is half-empty at all times anyways '' , i could see a lot of people voting yay . 
  problem would be : how to get the eu to be heard above our government crying `` omg omg they 're trying to make another yugoslavia , we 're independent and stronk '' ? 
  you just had to mention trieste , did n't you !, 
  i think poor slovenia would n't be arguing with us about the borders if you had n't annexed it , [ i mean just look at this sadness . 
  ] ( http://www.yourchildlearns.com/online-atlas/images/map-of-slovenia.gif ) ( good shopping there , tho , so i guess that makes it better . ), 
  as for places on the beach , ze germans be crazy . 
  they either get up at 6 am to put down the towel reservations ( us normal people do n't get up that early !, 
  ) , or they leave them overnight . 
  we 've had some ... [ creative solutions for that . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4v2cpk/angry_croatian_locals_burn_towels_left_on_a_beach/ ), 
  i think we `` surpass the record '' every year . 
  economists & co try to make us excited with such `` news '' in vain . 
  which makes me wonder : when will we hit a physical limit of how many tourists we can take ? 
  last year we had a ratio of 3,72 arrivals for every native living here ... 
  i mean , the coast is very long , towel-anschluss can continue fine , but i wonder at the accommodation . 
  last year when i visited split , it felt like you could hardly hear croatian on the riva build more towns with these euromonies ? 
  oh yeah , that bit with animals is seriously important . 
  a bit hard to build a prosperous society when your native animals are bison and idiot llamas ... just imagine our world without horses . 
  [ gp grey went into that here , ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeyh5wacqek ) in the context of `` how come there was n't an american plague that wiped out europeans ? '', 
   the european union is n't a country not with that attitude it is n't !, 
  one correction : it 's not communist-era . 
  that is , todori\u0107 started off by selling flowers of all things , started expanding in 80 's , but the real wind happened mostly later in the 90 's , and the whole model of operating is pigdog capitalism at its finest . 
  it 's one of the main exhibits people here would cite as `` well capitalism is n't all that great either '' . 
  mm , they were mostly keeping afloat with these debts until around 2014 , when they bought mercator . 
  as in , yes the company was huge and hugely indebted , but they also sell literal tons of stuff daily ( correction : on an hourly basis ) , so it was tolerable . 
  but then of course ivica 's greed for expansion did n't know limits and he bought the very indebted slovenian mercator , retail chain that was the biggest in balkans iirc ( or still is ) . 
  if memory serves right , slovenia was n't very happy about handing over such a big company , but agrokor twisted arms in terms of `` yea you have all these debts you ca n't repay , we 'll do that , give me most of the company in return '' . 
  that 's when nobody wanted to give new loans to agrokor anymore ... except for russians . 
  plus is did n't help that our economy has been wonky since the crash of 2008/9 , only just started recovering in 2015/16 . 
  i think that it would n't have been as bad if he did this in the consumer 's spending boom of earlier 2000 's ( and stayed away from mercator , goddamn pissing contests ) . 
  in any case , while i see some/a lot of firings in agrokor 's subsidiaries ( economists like to use gentle words like `` restructuring '' for that ) , and it may be that agrokor will fall apart as a concern eventually , most of its subsidiaries will be saved . 
  they 're too important in terms of products , pr , consumers buying their stuff ( if you ever visited this area , odds are you bought at least something owned by agrokor ) . 
  the creditors will take the largest hit . 
  if the west manipulated us into anything , that 's on the level of russians manipulating usa into electing trump . 
  meaning : the issues were many and varied , and blaming it on outsiders is silly . 
  ( if anything , west/outside world * did n't * want yugoslavia to fall apart , based on their behavior . ), 
  our thing was ... first , this area was never that rich historically , either under ottomans or being the borderlands buffer zone for centuries . 
  world wars were seriously bad . 
  then we had communism that was n't as bad as elsewhere ( another buffer zone , outsiders poured money , we industrialized ) , for example we were much better off than poland ... but it was still a lot of living off loans , and then economy crashed in the 80 's . 
  then there was a lost decade-and-some on war ( literally , croatia got back to its 1990 gdp somewhere in 2002/3 ) , also bad privatization ( we call it robbery here ) . 
  only started kinda recovering in the 2000 's . 
  and bits of germany . 
  let 's just call ourselves a colony , and first come first serve !, 
  * that means setting down the towels at 7 am , yes . 
  \\  some men just want to watch the world burn, 
  not winner , this was the first semi-final . 
  so 10 passed into finals : moldova azerbaijan greece sweden portugal poland armenia australia cyprus belgium . 
  ( imo albania , georgia and iceland were better than greece , sweden , australia and belgium , but that 's eurovision . 
  it 's important that armenia passed , so there 's that . ), 
  ok , armenia has to pass into the final round . 
  if for no other reason , then it 's because it 's not completely samey-same like half of the songs so far . 
  ( and it sounds pretty good , on top of being distinctive . ), 
  edit : in no particular order , except for armenia ~ armenia , poland , portugal , albania , cyprus , azerbaijan . 
  montenegro and epic sax guy for the comedic and meme value . 
  australia * because they 're europe . 
  * and , hmm . 
  i think georgia was ok . 
  well montenegro , as always , i love how few fucks you have to give . 
  ( on the other hand , i liked albania 's song . 
  despite the uncanny valley thing . ), 
  [ imo still one of the best tunes to come out of that whole contest ] ( https://youtu.be/axjt-rw2urg?t=38s ), 
  either that , or they wrote the song for two people , then jacques came in and said `` how about i save you some money '' . 
  well half of ours is in italian for some reason i have n't determined , can we get half a cookie at least ? 
  as another citizen from a formerly oppressive communist dictatorship , i get the feel that fellow citizens from formerly oppressive communist dictatorships look at various euros crying about `` merkelreich , sovereignty , eussr !, 
  ! , help help i 'm being oppressed , etc etc '' and think `` man , what a bunch of whiny snowflakes . 
  germany would have invaded uk or sent the tories to the eternal hunting grounds by now if eu was eussr . '', 
  * but do n't cite me on that . 
  ... well if warm feels are n't working , how about if they stuffed you with some `` perfectly symbolic '' [ mititei ?
