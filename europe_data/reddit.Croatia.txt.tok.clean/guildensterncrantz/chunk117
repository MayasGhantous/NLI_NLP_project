  you must prove your worth in eurovision first !, 
  but by that logic , everyone that 's sending weapons and similar help to war-areas is also fighting in that war . 
  which obviously is n't true , or else it 'd turn out that for example hungarians and germans fought in the yugo wars ( that 's where the majority of our weapons came from ) . 
  obviously equipment/other logistics help matters a lot , but making tanks in some safe factory and fighting in the trenches ( especially if the trenches happen to be on your own land ) is very , very different . 
  soviets killed some 8 out of 10 nazis , and that gives them most of the credit . 
  similar to that , usa gets the credit for japan .

  yeah , but you 're * swiss * . 
  if you completely joined the eu ( beyond the agreements currently in place ) , or any such political union/block for that matter , i 'd look for flying pigs and wonder if the end is near :p meanwhile , i do n't think anybody minds you not being in . 
  you cooperate where it 's really needed , mind your own business , and mind all our money , make sure nothing sad happens to it ;d, 
  not the main bits , i think . 
  going backwards in time , we had the yugo wars recently , then wwii and wwi , then the non-western balkans had the un-creatively named balkan wars around the turn of 20th century , those were the last push to get the ottomans away from here , plus there was a mess with redrawing the fresh borders . 
  before that , you had ottoman invasions and venice nibbling at the coast ( and not just here ) , and before that ... 
  i do n't even know . 
  iirc the migration period was predictably messy . 
  and * i think * the central/eastern parts had some shifting kingdoms , i seem to recall serbia extended much further south at some point , had some greek parts iirc . 
  not sure what romania and bulgaria were doing . 
  and then the byzantine empire had the typical empire-wars , but we learned that their thing was using money/diplomacy to stay safe more often than war . 
  ( that 's basically how they survived the fall of the western rome/the migration period , they paid off the invaders . ), 
  so we were n't exactly peaceful , but compared to the various borders and empires of poland , germany , france , uk , nordics etc etc doing their thing , you could say that we went to war with each other surprisingly rarely ( for europe ) . 
  too busy fighting ottomans , i guess . 
  plus the various incarnations of austro-hungary have a strange claim to fame : most of their expansion was done though peaceful politicking , instead of war . 
  eu will give 85 % of the money for the construction through the eu funds . 
  [ different article in croatian , ] ( https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/peljeski-most-dobio-pozitivno-misljenje-i-puni-iznos-sredstava-iz-eu-1157486 ) though google translate does a good enough job . 
  basically the commission still needs to 100 % confirm what was already given the green light , the long procedure of stamping papers is almost at the end . 
  the whole project will be 32,53 km long , with 2,4 km going for the bridge itself , and the rest being the access roads and the ston bypass . 
  i think the different numbers of euros in the two articles come from different definitions : the one in op says it 's 1,75 bn kuna ( around 235,5 million euros ) for access roads and bridge , while the one in this comment adds the bypass to the bill , so it 's 420,3 million euros .

  ] ( http://www.jutarnji.hr/incoming/peljeski_most.jpg/4428330/alternates/landscape_1180/peljeski_most.jpg ) now , as to why croatia is split like that , the tl ; dr is that in 1699 , ragusa ( dubrovnik & co ) and venice went like `` ewwww , i 'm not gon na border those people '' , so a strip of land was given to the ottomans . 
  because that makes * perfect sense * . 
  fast forward a few centuries , and that strip of land has been bosnian for so long we do n't even feel cool about the notion of taking away the only access to sea they have , nevermind how it would n't have the faintest chance of working out legally . 
  so we have a problem of the tourist-popular dubrovnik & co being split off from the rest . 
  and even though we cooperate well with bosnia about that border today ( you just need an id ) , the queues still get too epic , and that 's before we come to problems like our potential entrance into schengen . 
  as to why we never built it on our own , the foundation stone must have been set a half-dozen times ( it 's a popular thing to promise during the political campaigning ) , but we 're too europoor . 
  always had more pressing things to use that money for , and so it was delayed endlessly , and the issue was just this awkward but mostly ignored scar of history for us . 
  so , thank you eu , the oddness of our ancestors will finally be partially fixed with your help !, 
  [ \\* ode to joy intensifies * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnjwuye9uvu ), 
  i 'm not sure how much of it was the `` learning from mistakes '' bit . 
  that is , i agree with you in general , but i also think that people forget the horrors too easily , or even take wrong lessons from them ( the blame game , everyone likes to blame `` others '' , not themselves ) . 
  rather , i think eu gives us peace for a different reason . 
  some smart people put their heads together , and figured out that if you tie the wallets together , going to war will eventually be unthinkable because everyone simply loses too much , up to and including the psychopaths who do n't * care * about the usual things like `` people suffering '' ( we call them war profiteers here ) . 
  then the same people made it so that us euros can more easily just ... hang out together , and after some time of doing that , propaganda about `` they ^ tm are our enemies because of x '' falls on increasingly deaf ears . 
  oh , not just changing country . 
  our borders/country shape over here is such that the roaming bullshit catches you when driving on the north/eastern motorway , for example . 
  so now at least i wo n't have to wrestle with that at least when i 'm close to hungary/slovenia . 
  ( and reason number 27 to advocate bosnia eventually getting into eu . ), 
  ha , not as much as the western/northern euros ( i mention northern because sweden and denmark somehow managed to beat the uk-france record in the number of wars ) . 
  do n't know if that 's because we 're `` too low energy '' over here , or because we were busy with ottomans for the longest time ( insert accordion ) , but when you compare the number of wars against neighbors , we 're practically cuddly over here . 
  do n't know about you , but i 'm getting in the mood for ( gentle ) anschluss here . 
  in fact , if `` the eu '' would exile our politicians to siberia ( or bumfuck nowhere , sweden ) , i 'd say that 37,5 % of our folks would n't even notice , and 34,2 % would be grateful . 
  ( the remaining 28,3 % would try to stir up trouble , but they should have been committed a while back anyways , in my expert opinion . ),

  france , you 're over-achieving . 
  + today i farmed respectable karma by quoting some random french redditor : `` we go on a strike to complain about x. 
  we go home and complain about the strike . '', 
  coming from a nation that loves to complain at any given time of the day but rarely strikes about anything , i admire your high energy , france . 
  + thanks for making pepe cry this sunday , france . 
  it felt like collective justice to this non-pepe denizen of the internet !, 
  + random people on the internet ( i think they 're mostly brits and americans ) going `` hurr durr white flag '' are either examples of * banter * being misunderstood by outsiders ( possible with the love-hate relationship uk and france had though history , i think ? 
  ) , or examples of failed education . 
  have n't these people learned about napoleon at least ?? 
  + if my foggy memory of history lessons serves right , french language , culture , fashion etc etc were the cool thing to adopt across much of europe in the several centuries before the 20th . 
  sort of like , they were the usa of the time when it comes to culture . 
  * armchair sociologists * think that part of the current `` french pretending not to understand english even though they do '' is saltiness about that change .

  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dxuheifhmo ) ) my favorite account of his famous last words is : * according to one story , his last words were , `` now is not the time for making new enemies . '', 
  it was his response to a priest at the side of his deathbed , asking voltaire to renounce satan . 
  * based on his usual statements , it may as well be true < 3 + so , as if my yaoi-fangirl teenaged days were n't weird enough , discovering polandball lead me to start * shipping * colored-ball representations of countries . 
  [ france and germany are by far my favorites . 
  hah , i think that the trolley problem pops up in various wars every other day . 
  because of that , i 'm very bewildered by random people who think cheerfully about `` dealing with '' whatever enemy nation ( think russia or turkey in recent times ) . 
  are they just kidding ( so many of them ) ? 
  have they not learned history ? 
  have they bought into the airbrushed picture of war from hollywood and epic ballads ? 
  idk . 
  but since you seem informed on this particular topic ( good comment !, 
  ) , what do you think of the notion of japan surrendering if/when soviets invaded as well ? 
  cause i vaguely remember that japan was mostly broken but also impossibly stubborn as you say , but then some people think that usa+ussr would have been enough to ... well , un-stubborn them . 
  cause japan was very scared of soviets , iirc . 
  like , fighting until the bitter end was a matter of honor , but such absolutely impossible odds being shown to the people would sort of give the emperor + generals `` an out '' . 
  since they * saw reason * under the threat of more nukes , would n't they also see reason against ( almost ) equally impossible odds against conventional armies ?
