  i remember that being one of the big arguments against the necessity of nukes . 
  ( that 's not to argue that it was n't in usa 's best interests to end the war in the fastest way possible , as they did . 
  but that 's a different argument . ), 
  ha , you 're talking to someone that ( foggily , cause too young ) remembers an irl war . 
  does that count ? 
  :p and i 'd rather not fight in any war , if possible . 
  if it happened that i 'm a soldier in that situation , yeah i 'm almost positive that i 'd be more concerned with saving my own damn life , than that of some random civilians i do n't know . 
  so sure , i 'd rather go home instead of keep fighting for years . 
  does n't make my self-preserving opinions and choices right , and i think that if at some later point i tried to argue that the event that got me home * was n't * a war crime , more detached people would rightly call bullshit . 
  oh , i think i should have made myself clearer . 
  i think it goes like this : if we do n't do x , y will happen . 
  let 's say we calculated that y is worse than x by 50 % or 100 % . 
  ok , so , we do x. 
  but x is * also * horrible , it 's just less horrible , but that does n't negate the point that x is bad . 
  or something like that . 
  war is imo shitty regardless of why you 're fighting it , but that does n't mean that i think there are no legitimate causes for war ( especially if it 's defensive ) , or that `` all sides are the same '' , correction would be `` give me any war and i 'll find at least some war crimes done by the more-good-guy side '' . 
  so in my specific case , i 'm not sure whether bombing hiroshima and nagasaki in such a way was truly necessary , and i consider it a war crime , but i also acknowledge that * it worked * to end the war , and i also think that japan was not only the aggressor , * their * crimes were greater . 
  ( similar goes for nazis and holocaust vs the crimes done against german civilians . ), 
  i do feel that the random `` good-ish '' guys in war xyz committing crimes often gets swept under the rug though , which imo is n't helping . 
  learn from history , bla bla . 
  ... why are you even responding to me anymore ? 
  obviously we do n't see eye to eye , and that 's not going to change . 
  here , last ditch attempt , as simple as i can make it : you can drop a certain number of firebombs , cluster bombs , whatever bombs , and not kill hundreds of thousands of people . 
  ( obviously , given * enough * bombardment , the same number of people will die . 
  numbers of victims also obviously depend on how good your aim is , how much you care to aim precisely , the type of bomb we 're talking etc. ), 
  you can not do the same with nukes , all they ever do is mass-destroy an area . 
  if i still have n't made myself clear to you with that , it 's useless . 
  i 'm done talking with you . 
  i never said that the other bombings are n't crimes . 
  i mentioned hiroshima and nagasaki since i assumed they 're the most * well-known * bombings of japan . 
  and if you read my other comments in this thread , you 'd see that i acknowledge that a certain amount of collateral damage is * tolerated * even today , so obviously the acceptable terms of conduct would be even looser in the context of wwii . 
  but . 
  nukes are weapons of mass destruction , no way around it . 
  their whole * purpose * is to level and radioactively poison an area , and on such a scale , that you can barely argue that they 're `` legitimate if dropped over some military targets that happen to be in cities '' . 
  i consider the use of nukes over - or `` close enough '' to - any inhabited area a war crime * by default * , regardless of who does it and why . 
  [ and imo it 's a matter of shame for humanity that weapons like this were ever developed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tsar_bomba#test ), 
  not that much , actually . 
  i vaguely remember that he 's an eurosceptic ( cause that affects me , lol ) , he 's leader of labour , and he 's usually cited as the reason the opposition to tories is lame in uk . 
  the context always goes like `` corbyn '' , and that 's it , his name is taken as self-explanatory among brits ( and people who follow uk politics ) , which i take to mean that a literal clown would make for a more credible leader of the opposition . 
  i think he has all the charisma of a cactus plant ? 
  oh , and i heard that the press has n't been easy on him ... 
  i ran into accusations of a smear-campaign . 
  ... and i think his party does n't like him either ? 
  or , the traditional voters of labor ? 
  ( so i thought he 'd work out as a good short-hand for how incompetent our sdp leader/opposition is . ), 
  collateral damage is one thing , bullets and bombs `` going astray '' is as old as bullets and bombs . 
  leveling cities and calling it `` collateral damage '' is such a thin excuse it 's positively transparent . 
   as for restrictions on bombings of cities in war , nothing at the time of wwii covered it as a side-note , `` genocide '' is a term that 's been coined in 1944 , specifically for the case of nazi policies , and has been first used as a legal term in nuremberg trials . 
  does that mean that all the events we call genocide that happened before wwii - are n't ? 
  someone should tell the armenians !, 
  no but seriously now , while i 'm not a fan of applying laws retroactively , here we 're discussing whether hiroshima and nagasaki had all the elements of a war crime by modern understanding . 
  if we 'll go by legalese , all sorts of hideous events though history end up being `` well it was n't bad because the laws of the time allowed it '' . 
  i 'm even less of a fan of moral relativism excusing horrible things . 
  wait . 
  so nagasaki and hiroshima had legitimate military targets , and it 's perfectly legal and sensible to bomb those in a war . 
  that 's like ... hmm . 
  ok , i have a recent modern equivalent . 
  `` it 's legitimate to bomb hospitals because they 're treating soldiers , same soldiers who will then get up and fight us again . '', 
  i actually heard that reasoning , nevermind the fact that most of the people in such hospitals are civilians , and they die all the same . 
  it all sounds like a very nonsense argument to me . 
  as i said elsewhere in this thread , i 'm not denying that this bombing achieved its tactical military goal . 
  i 'm saying that dropping nukes on mostly-civilian cities , and this after the military leadership knew perfectly well what nukes do to their surroundings , means that the hundreds of thousands of civilians that * predictably * died ca n't even be excused under `` oops , never knew that 'll happen '' or `` oops , we mis-aimed , civilians got accidentally caught in the cross-fire , what can you do , it happens in war , etc etc '' . 
  the leadership made a conscious decision to level two cities , same cities that were mostly full of civilians . 
  what if 's and `` what would have happened if they had n't '' and `` do civilian deaths happen in every single war '' is beyond the point when we 're discussing `` is this a war crime ? '', 
  i 'm not denying that these bombings did their work successfully ( and in my opinion there are several different effects that can be counted as `` success '' in that story ) . 
  i 'm just saying that it was a terrible war crime and a successful military tactic at the same time ... but then again , i have critical opinions on what war is , and how it works out for the populace . 
  the short of it is : forget about the airbrushed versions of war you see in hollywood blockbusters and epic ballads . 
  be it considered legitimate or not , war is ugly . 
   it is stupid to call it a warcrime if firebombing of other japanese cities do n't count as one . 
  civilian deaths are war crimes , simple as that . 
  they 're ... * tolerated * until a certain point ( or proven intention to kill civilians ) because civilians usually get caught in the crossfire ( that 's what happens when you make plans to `` take '' any city ) . 
  but i seriously doubt that * anyone * could feign ignorance about what these nukes would do to civilian cities . 
  nukes are the opposite of `` precise '' . 
   im not saying that it was not horrible but people overlook many lives saved as a result of japanese surrender . 
  scrap that train of thought , because `` if we had n't , it would have been worse '' can be used to excuse every single war crime , ever . 
  `` if we do n't bomb the twin towers of new york , these americans will keep bombing the middle east '' was likely used as an excuse by bin laden at some point . 
  oh , it 's in the western world as well . 
  the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki being a war crime is somehow still [ `` debatable . 
  '' ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atomic_bombings_of_hiroshima_and_nagasaki#debate_over_bombings ) ( this is despite the fact that usa quite literally dropped two nuclear bombs on two * mostly civilian * cities and killed 129,000 -- 226,000 people , because * terror tactics * are forgivable if you 're `` a good guy '' . 
  if that is not a war crime , then nothing short of holocaust is . ), 
  then the other day we had some british redditors professing that they never heard of the british raj . 
  i think that sweeping the bad stuff under the carpet , or at least downplaying it by certain levels of omission , happens just about everywhere . 
  ( except for germany , maybe . ), 
  ohh , wish i could be reading that whole inaccurately named `` trilogy '' for the first time again < 3  `` the story so far :  in the beginning the universe was created . 
  this has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move . '', 
  i 'm quoting some french redditor :  `` we go on a strike to complain about x ''  `` we go home and complain about the strike '', 
  ah , but you can say that for the next 10 or more years . 
  it 's like people pointing out that le pen losing means she 'll just probably regroup in 2022 if france does n't improve in the next 5 years . 
  true on the face of it ( lord knows eu needs improvements , and france has legit problems ) , but that kind of thinking leads you to the conclusion that eu is in a state of eternal crisis . 
  all sorts of problems will keep showing up forever , at some point crying `` crisis , crisis , hide yo children '' and/or `` brexit , frexit , nexit , grexit , italexit '' just turns into useless panicking . 
  * and a hatred towards the meme z-exit . 
  \\  `` i do n't know if you got it '' \\  `` but i think that political correctness is bad '' \\  '' ... amirite ? '', 
  because it feels like a useless correction . 
  everybody knows , so what 's the point of a correction that everybody knows is unnecessary ? 
  call all this `` victory for europe/we 're all european today/etc etc '' a figure of speech/metaphor , if it helps . 
  that 's the first part . 
  the 2nd part is the people who say they 're `` anti-eu but pro-europe '' , and that 's the reason they go around correcting everyone , and this feels like a logical fallacy to many ( most ? ), 
  of the people on this sub . 
  i assumed that bobkellylikes is in this 2nd group ( assumed based on my experience with redditors ) , hence this fruitless comment chain .
