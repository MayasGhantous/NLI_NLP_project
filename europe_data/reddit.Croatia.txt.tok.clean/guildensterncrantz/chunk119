  corporate taxes - well , he did throw shade at tax heavens in eu . 
  and do n't get me wrong , i do n't think ireland needs to raise its 12.5 % ( iirc ) tax to be more equal to france immediately , but unfunny hijinks like apple getting away with paying close to 0 % tax needs to go . 
  and from what i 've seen of irish redditors here , they 're aware that the apple-type cases need to go . 
  as for deindustrialization ... that 's a globalism/capitalism/technology problem , not an eu problem . 
  robots are taking old jobs , cheaper workforces are taking jobs ( and we ca n't return that industry here unless we 're willing to work for chinese wages ) . 
  that shit happened in my country more than a decade before we joined the eu . 
  i guess that eu may implement some bandaids for it , but i do n't see a way to return us to the 60 's -80 's time , with or without eu . 
  sure , how they plan ahead makes a lot of difference , as does their reaction time to random problems you would n't quite expect . 
  i 'd put the euro in the first box ( the way it 's implemented is flawed from the beginning ) and the migrants in the second ( the 2015 wave was an oddity and the reaction was slow and confused ) . 
  like ... hmm , let 's say algeria goes to war with morocco in the next 5 years . 
  nothing much we can do about that , it seems an unlikely event so we wo n't plan for it , and there 'll be waves of people coming in again . 
  or some other , random 3rd crisis . 
  i think there 's only so much planning you can do for such randomness . 
  bloody hell , for all i know , usa and russia may go to war at some point in the future , but i feel that trying to prepare for that is a waste of time ( we 're all fucked anyways if that happens ) . 
  \\  `` me and my wallet '', 
  as already stated , fn had a lot of opportunity in these elections , and their result did n't quite reflect that . 
  assuming they 'll have a better opportunity in 5 years seems thin to me . 
  < looking for my armchair  < there it is !  < armchair sociology time  i do n't think he has a lot of work to do . 
  perhaps a middling amount , 6 on the scale of 10 at most . 
  the eu had two different crises since 2008 , the euro , and the migrants . 
  migrants wo n't ever be resolved completely ( or at least , people will keep trying to get into europe as long as europe is more well-off ) , the war in syria will most likely wind down in the next few years , and just increasing the border guard and shouting `` do n't come here , you 're not welcome ! '', 
  will make * enough * difference imo . 
  euro crisis wound down by now ( except in greece ) . 
  and the finance side of the eu needs a lot of work for sure , but i somehow doubt your common folk that vote for populists care much about phrases such as `` fiscal consolidation '' and similar . 
  they mostly care about having enough money in their pockets , and since the eu economy is recovering across the board , if it keeps doing that , i do n't think le pen and similar will get enough of the `` angry critical mass '' for a revolution . 
  now , obviously we might get some `` 3rd crisis '' in the next few years . 
  or we might not , we go back to the 2000-2008 eu situation ( which had the same inherent flaws in the finance side ) , and people stop caring . 
  take down the youth unemployment by some % , and nobody will care to rock the boat . 
  thank you , professor , i never knew that political unions and continents are n't the same thing !, 
  what would i do without clever trolling folks like you !, 
  here 's a piece of information for you , in return for the favor : * everyone * knows that the political eu and geographical europe are not the same thing . 
  most people could n't care less , though . 
  another piece of information for you : when you see random people on reddit saying `` we 're all european today '' or `` tonight 's result is a victory for europe !, 
  '' , or similar statements that equalize europe with eu , they do n't care for the difference between europe and eu either . 
  or you could say , * europe * is meaningless , * eu * has meaning , such statements usually mean `` this is a victory * for the europe that has meaning * ! '', 
  this whole chain , i was wondering if you 'll make a point where eu * is n't * good for europe , or you 'd explain that europe ( geography ) has actual meaning to you that it does n't for most people ( like for example , you 'd argue that us europeans share meaningful things without the eu , like culture , friendship etc ) . 
  but no , all you wanted to point out something that any child knows . 
  what a waste of my time , this chain . 
  bye now . 
  then why are you deliberately ignoring the points * i * tried to bring up , in relation to yours ? 
  you made a comment , i added to it with a counter-point or expansion ( depending on how you look at it ) , you kept repeating your same initial point , which is n't engaging in a meaningful debate . 
  for example , debating would be arguing the point that `` non-eu countries would benefit from eu falling apart '' or `` europe would benefit from eu falling apart '' and so on . 
  my points ~ 1 . 
  `` europe '' has little meaning as itself , as a geographical term , * so who gives a shit * about what such a meaningless `` eu is n't europe '' term/group of countries thinks ? 
  meaning , your point - often repeated on this sub - is empty . 
  we can argue that eu is actually good for non-eu countries as well ( unless you 're russia and turkey ) , and this includes many non-european countries like china who gets much better trade , so we can even say that `` tonight 's result is a victory for the world ! '' ... 
  unless you 're an enemy of eu , the countries that are part of it , the countries that will become part of it , the increased peace it brings to * europe * etc. 
  and if you 're an enemy-country , again , who cares about such an opinion - europe going back to what it was in the world wars is a net loss for the whole world . 
  ... and i 'm still looking for * your actual point * in this increasingly frustrating chain . 
  do you have anything other than arguing semantics ? 
  how about you answer my question - the one i bolded ? 
  is your whole point `` op should have said - tonight 's result is a victory for eu '' ? 
  if that 's so , you trolled me well , and i should have never tried to engage in a conversation with you . 
  since `` res tags remember '' , i wo n't ever make that mistake again . 
  by that logic , the rest of the world should just sign out from every single american website or piece of software . 
  or to put it in another , more absurd way : germany exports volkswagen to usa . 
  `` usa should learn german to operate that car '' . 
  and i 'm not talking `` a lot '' . 
  i 'm talking * everywhere * . 
  for example , [ this stat ] ( https://www.statista.com/statistics/325144/reddit-global-active-user-distribution/ ) says that 43.55 % of reddit 's desktop traffic is from usa . 
  it does n't feel that way . 
  it feels like more like 90 % , just based on my interactions and browsing . 
  and it certainly does n't help that your campaign-time is measured in ... years instead of months . 
  well , 597 days , that roughly translates into 1 year and 7 months ( ! ) . 
  with the term lasting 4 years , this is around 40 % of reddit time spent on bloody usa elections ... and i initially came here for the cat gifs ( \u0ca5 \u0ca5 ), 
  for more than a year , there were pepes * everywhere * . 
  even with res-blocking , one could not escape the greatness of the donald and his centipedes ( maga ! ), 
  in random places on the internet . 
  i knew more about usa 's elections than i did about my own country 's politics ( during a time when i did n't want to know anything about * any * politics of any country ) . 
  seeing the pepe cry feels like justice . 
  ... i do n't understand what you 're going on about . 
  no one with the basic access to relevant information thinks that eu is literally europe . 
  europe is a continent , eu is a political union on that continent ( and even that 's debatable in the case of cyprus ) . 
  * everybody knows that . 
  * what do you think the spirit , the real meaning , of this post is ? 
  arguing semantics like eu ! = europe ? 
  your initial comment was , and i quote again : `` it 's a victory for the eu but not europe as there is a difference because more than 60 % of europe is not in the eu . '', 
  my whole point in this chain is : europe * without * the eu has no great meaning . 
  it 's just a big piece of land , same as every other big piece of land in the world . 
  ( and we could debate ad nauseam how this peace of land worked out - or did n't - historically . ), 
  eu , on the other hand , brings a lot of peace and prosperity to its members . 
  it 's still expanding , so the non-members can hope to join one day . 
  that makes it good news for `` europe '' ... ... unless you 're russia , or turkey , or any of the european/world countries whose known position is hostile . 
  here 's a counter-question , to make myself clearer . 
  you say that `` it 's good for eu , not europe that 's not in eu . '', 
  why ? 
  ** do you think the non-eu countries would somehow * benefit * from eu falling apart ? 
  maybe patriotism is what you 're speaking of ? 
  because i can agree that patriotism served various countries well in the past ( and present ) . 
  the difference is - patriotism is the general love you have for your country and people . 
  nationalism is loving the same to the point that you ca n't / wo n't admit the failures and wrongs of your country , think it 's somehow inherently superior to other countries etc. 
  imperialism that has plagued europe ( and the world ) for all of its history is the next level , after nationalism . 
  much easier to go and steal from , or kill , some random neighbors if you think they 're `` lesser people , stands to reason we deserve their clay etc '' . 
  hah , i saw that too and wondered . 
  what are you producing ( i think big industry is a good thing , mind you ) ? 
  no , it did n't . 
  they started coming into croatia once hungary closed its borders . 
  so , we can all close our borders ... except for greece and italy , especially greece ... look at aegean . 
  all those islands close to turkey are theirs . 
  unless greece starts literally drowning them , or somehow catapulting them back to the middle east ( and can you imagine the reaction to that ) , it 's not going to stop completely .
