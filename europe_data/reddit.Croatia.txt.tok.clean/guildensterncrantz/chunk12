  eh , maybe in terms of history , and our various stats are good . 
  but if i 'll go by military power , innovation , cultural influence ( think media ) , i 'd say that us of a beats us for the past 70-100 years . 
  so we 're kinda salty at that . 
  mwahahaa , you have the `` julian alps '' , we have the `` dinaric alps '' . 
  everybody has alps these days , probably in an attempt to stop being balkan . 
  * alps all the way to tokyo !, 
  do n't worry , we can sense the smugness coming down from triglav ;d ( nice of you to try , thoough . ), 
  north/west europe does n't have the exclusive copyright to everything good . 
  and `` good '' is even debatable in this case , as you can see from [ some of the comments . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61gczr/ease_of_doing_business_in_2017_country_global/dfefxz2/ ) in any case , i explained the context and listed out the main factors [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61gczr/ease_of_doing_business_in_2017_country_global/dfe9apu/ ) . 
  this ranking basically boils down to the number of procedures and permits you need to run your business . 
  and i think it 's more interesting than the nth predictable map of how north/west dominates everything , for example til that belgium has too many taxes & co , despite being a more well-off country . 
  [ list here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index#ranking ) it 's new zealand :d then it 's singapore 2 , hong kong 4 , south korea 5 , us of a at 8 , to the surprise of no-one . 
  taiwan is 11 . 
  lurkers are people too ? 
  ( but seriously , idk . 
  may be an alt , or may have just deleted almost everything with a script . 
  oldest comment is from 2 days ago , plus definitely should n't have this accumulated post karma . ), 
  bwahaah , 13.8 million arrivals in 2016 , with 4.2 million natives . 
  seriously it 's been a long-standing parody , how politicians on a campaign promise all the awesome euromonies that 'll make us a land of milk and honey . 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_fusu3u8o8  \u266a \u266b when one day tourism blossoms  and swabians come in record numbers  the whole country will from summer alone  live like a king  only will the eternal recreationists ,  work on the field or be soldiers  slavonia will be a golf course  if working too much , arrested \u266a \u266b, 
  probably , yep . 
  and if for nothing else , i 'd like it because i mildly fell in love when i watched their [ geography now video ] ( https://youtu.be/ywxvdxovfm4?t=2m52s ) ( and even though it 's just one of the possible origins of name , `` the land of the wolves '' is so cool ! ) . 
  mind you , i do n't see it happening until the troubles with russia and the break-away regions are resolved . 
  well ... 
  i do n't think that 's fair . 
  this is just a comparative list of countries , if by some miracle the whole world got 20 % more efficient tomorrow , the rankings would stay the same . 
  and as you can see from for example switzerland , this index does n't exactly tell you a lot about things like gdp , education , democracy , healthcare etc etc. 
  it just basically boils down to what i think of as `` how many dumb fetch-quests do i have to go through to run a firm ? '', 
  with that said , from what i know as an outsider , italy does have some problems with efficiency ( despite having one of the stronger economies in the world ) . 
  ahaah at least that makes sense to me , as far as rivalries go . 
  on the other hand , i never knew that for example finland and netherlands have this `` map-rivalry '' going on ( [ exhibit a ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5mytzu/ranking_of_european_healthcare_systems_according/dc7ezog/ ) ) , never saw that outside of reddit \\ ^ ^, 
  let me guess , you 're from portugal ? 
  georgia is especially impressive when you look at where they started - 100th in 2006 . 
  then they jumped to 37 in 2007 , so there must have been some big-ass reform at that time . 
  apparently there was a revolution there in 2003 , after which georgia turned to the west and pursued some democratic and economic reforms ? 
  i do n't know much about it . 
  but whatever it was , looks like it 's working , [ look at their gdp . 
  ] ( https://www.google.hr/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=ny_gdp_pcap_cd&amp;idim=country:geo:arm:ukr&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en ), 
  well , i can only speak for croatia , and even that is uncertain - i never tried to run a business for example . 
  but since we 're comparatively low , from what i know/hear - a lot of the main factors in the grading start with `` procedures for x '' . 
  we have the best * procedures * , ask anyone , they only take years and there are 5758 of them for everything !, 
  all the business permits you need , well the public sector gives them , and same public sector is hilariously byzantine and slow . 
  and of course there are elements of cronyism , sometimes it matters more who you know instead of what you know . 
  mind you i think it 's better now than 10-20 years ago , but yeah - we have a lot of room for improvement . 
  what i hear of bosnia is us + steroids , and they 're comparable to ukraine , so i imagine the same reasons might apply . 
  some ukranian can probably give a better overview of the situation , though . 
  yea they were a surprise to me . 
  well , them , also moldova , georgia and armenia , plus luxembourg ( !! ) . 
  you 'd expect a map like this to mostly align with economic performance , hdi and such things , and it does for the most part , but then you have outliers like macedonia . 
  which is - good on them !, 
  can you remember the healthcare map , what it was titled with ? 
  ca n't find it atm . 
  ## sources and notes the latest 2017 ranking of countries is listed [ here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index#ranking ) the source for that wiki list comes from [ doing business 2017 - equal opportunity for all ] ( http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports/global-reports/doing-business-2017 ) . 
  note that this list does n't tell you which economy is stronger or anything like that , all it boils down is basically how easy it is to open/run a business in any particular country - `` higher rankings ( a low numerical value ) indicate better , usually simpler , regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights . '', 
  major factors are : + ** starting a business ** -- procedures , time , cost and minimum capital to open a new business + ** dealing with construction permits ** -- procedures , time and cost to build a warehouse + ** getting electricity ** -- procedures , time and cost required for a business to obtain a permanent electricity connection for a newly constructed warehouse + ** registering property ** -- procedures , time and cost to register commercial real estate + ** getting credit ** -- strength of legal rights index , depth of credit information index + ** protecting investors ** -- indices on the extent of disclosure , extent of director liability and ease of shareholder suits + ** paying taxes ** -- number of taxes paid , hours per year spent preparing tax returns and total tax payable as share of gross profit + ** trading across borders ** -- number of documents , cost and time necessary to export and import + ** enforcing contracts ** -- procedures , time and cost to enforce a debt contract + ** resolving insolvency ** -- the time , cost and recovery rate ( % ) under bankruptcy proceeding . 
  the list has 190 countries , and i changed the colors to point out the europe-differences better . 
  original color-map looks like [ this . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/doing_business_2017.svg/1920px-doing_business_2017.svg.png ) ( yes , the majority of europe has a bit of a `` first world problems '' thing going on . ), 
  seriously . 
  i would n't go so far as to take away their voting rights immediately after they leave , but for example my uncle moved to canada 30 years ago , he has no plans to ever return here , and yet he still votes for who 'll run the country . 
  it 's beyond ridiculous . 
  i 'd remove the permit after some time , 10-15 years or so . 
  it 'd be interested to see that as well . 
  ca n't find anything on a quick search , aside from half of athletes having lowered performance , and [ this study on medical students . 
  ] ( https://www.omicsgroup.org/journals/the-impact-of-menstrual-period-on-physical-condition-academic-performance-and-habits-of-medical-students-2167-0420.1000185.php?aid=30388 ) but when you look at that list of symptoms and their frequency in the population , yea i 'd say that you have a good point - if the woman in question ( it varies from woman to woman ) is basically physically sick , it 's highly unlikely her work performance will be as good as it should be . 
  edit : from the study on students : `` academic performance was affected as well ; study time ( 76.0 % ) , concentration ( 65.8 % ) , group activities ( 58.1 % ) , examination performance ( 51.8 % ) and attendance ( 40.8 % ) . '', 
  in a tl ; dr , it 's the shedding of the uterine lining . 
  and that tells you sweet fuck all on why some women are in pain and others are n't , and if you visit any gynecologist and do all the tests , they 'll end up shrugging and saying `` well , idk why it 's that bad , there 's nothing wrong with you physically '' . 
  as for contraception pills , it 's be nice if they were covered by the insurance . 
  or if they did n't have some unfortunate side-effects , or if they - or general pain relief - were an * actual cure * instead of the equivalent of a bandage . 
  i mean in other news we have robots strolling around mars which we are atm planning to colonize , also we 're working on creating artificial intelligence , and yet our period-pain solutions are on the level of `` have you tried turning it on and off ? '', 
  your testosterone hurts about as much as an impacted wisdom tooth ? 
  seriously ? 
  is this part-time job enough to keep these women below the poverty line ? 
  if that 's so in netherlands , good on them . 
  mind you what i think should be done is not giving women more time-off , but medical research into why painful periods happen in the first place , and how to stop that . 
  i mean we 're growing whole hearts-for-transplant in a lab today , and yet we still ca n't handle something that negatively affects so many people every single month , because `` well whatever , they grin and bear it '' . 
  no , europe without eu is just a bunch of fairly small countries that do n't affect other european countries in any substantial way . 
  seriously , if we 'll go by influence , i 'm waaaay more affected by usa/russia/china / turkey than for example the nordics . 
  they may as well live on the other side of the planet , so people talking about `` europe '' as if it 's has actual meaning ( without these unions ) puzzles me . 
  like for example `` hurr durr they 're unelected bureaucrats ! '', 
  except we either elect them directly , or they 're set up by the national government we elected earlier . 
  i never mentioned * our defenders . 
  * `` they '' are people who think that serbia still gives three shits about us - i suppose they do that after they 're finished worrying over eu vs russia and the fact that they 're not doing so well on the economic side of things , so they remember us at ... 5 minutes to midnight . 
  `` they '' are people who go on about the war that finished * 22 years ago * while our young educated workforce is moving to ireland . 
  `` they '' are people who use ** poglavnik ** as part of their username , because they 're still proud of hitler 's little lapdog monster who set us all back decades - have you no shame ?!, 
  `` they '' are people who make me ashamed of my flair . 
  caring about the croatian/serbian relations . 
  over here , rightest-wingers sometimes hurr durr about serbia/war / * disibiodevesprve * to attract their idiotic voters ( and distract them from their empty pockets ) , also in recent times the trollish left-wing zoki tried to imitate them and failed spectacularly . 
  but i think that nobody in our politics honestly cares , for the past 10-15 years nothing much changed in actual trade and things like that , which is what matters ( and people like todori\u0107 actually drive trade , not politicians ) . 
  so , `` appearance '' of caring , making it a talking point , without actually meaning to do anything . 
  for example over here the more relevant talking points , the ones where politicians actually mean to do something , are eu/nato/etc . 
  ewww , it 's posting here : s until this tragic moment , never seen one of them on reddit , in my mind they were blissfully away , infesting the youtube comment section and various news ' portals . 
  side-note : is n't \u0160e\u0161elj the only one giving the appearance of caring ? 
  with his occasional flag-burning . 
  ( mind you i 've been told that he gets clinically depressed if he ca n't burn the random eu/nato/croatian flag every now and then , so i guess that 's fine . ), 
  it 's like being in `` eastern europe '' , but even worse .
