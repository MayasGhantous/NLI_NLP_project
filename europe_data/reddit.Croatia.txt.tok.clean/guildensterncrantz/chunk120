  i 've explained myself several times . 
  i assumed that you 're one of the people who thinks that the distinction between the eu and europe matters , because you said :  it 's a victory for the eu but not europe as there is a difference because more than 60 % of europe is not in the eu . 
  so , correction would be `` it 's a victory for the europe the rest of us care for . 
  unless we 're talking russia and turkey , who have a way of making themselves relevant without the eu . '', 
  europe atm is divided into eu , those that are n't eu but they 're big ( russia , turkey ) , those that are trying to get into eu ( rest of balkans , even ukraine ) , and ... belarus and moldova . 
  and nobody gives a toss about the moldovan elections . 
  ( and then there 's the uk . 
  remains to be seen if you 'll be irrelevant , enemy , or ally post-brexit . ), 
  i 'm with you in that eu should be less accepting in terms of welfare etc , i think that 'd make a big difference . 
  however , would n't we need an isolated christmas island somewhere to detain the migrants , sort out who 's a real refugee and who 's just looking for a better job ? 
  and we do n't have that . 
  unless greece sections off one of its aegean islands , proclaims it a non-schengen zone etc. . . and then deporting them back is troublesome too ( turkey/libya/etc can just say `` lmao no '' ) . 
  eu is something that i 'm part of , along with 28 ( 27 ) other countries . 
  so , what happens in all of them affects me in greater or smaller measure . 
  that 's not true for me or my country before the eu . 
  in other words , i 'd lose most of my reasons to even visit this sub and follow the news if the eu was n't in existence ( and still expanding ) . 
  people talk about `` common european identity and friendship that 'll exist even if we break the eu '' and some such , and i have little idea where they 're coming from . 
  in fact , i 'd say that the main thing us europeans had in common though all of history is fighting with each other . 
  eu , flawed as it is , makes that very difficult , so today 's result is a good thing for me . 
  i mentioned russia because it has the biggest section of the non-eu population . 
  and i mentioned brexit in case you 're among the people who think that eu ! = europe is a relevant point - i 've seen it a lot around these parts . 
  `` just because we 're anti-eu , does n't mean we 're anti-europe '' . 
  well , from where i 'm standing , without the eu , a half-dozen to dozen countries in europe are relevant to me ( and though history , that was n't always very friendly either ) . 
  * europe * by itself , if country x is n't in eu ( and is n't russia or turkey , very special cases ) , they may as well be on the other side of the world . 
  * europe * is just a continent . 
  internet armchair statisticians . 
  \\  le the polls were wrong before \\  le hillary lost \\  le do n't trust the * experts *, 
  hm , true about the climate change bit . 
  africa is drying out as we speak , and its population is still growing ... 2040 will make 2015 look like a sneeze . 
  what to do then , i wonder . 
  build a wall in the mediterranean and make usa pay for it ? 
  well russia joining the eu ( what a preposterous thought ) would turn the eu into ... eurasia . 
  russia is basically a continent for itself , it makes no sense . 
  as for the general argument that eu ! = europe , it 's true on paper , but europe without eu does n't have a lot of meaning . 
  brexit affects my life , what the uk was up to in the 70 's did n't . 
  the thing about corruption : well , it 's not like the thieves give anyone the stats about their thievery ( they 'd be imprisoned - non-functional - thieves otherwise ) . 
  so all you can count is the `` perception '' . 
  condolences , vladimir !, 
  putin , is that your newest plan ? 
  i do n't think he 's blind to the way hollande and his whole party did in these elections . 
  or that the eu in general is blind to the fact that a putin shill got some 35 % in the 2nd biggest eu economy . 
  or , in other words : these eu leaders are * the governments we all elected * . 
  if they 're that blind to the way the wind is blowing , we 're all fucked anyways . 
  it 's saved from falling apart immediately . 
  baby steps . 
  tl ; dr is * more federalization * , i think . 
  harmonization of taxes , for example recently he threw shade on tax-avoidance that happens in eu ... ireland is one of the culprits . 
  the main reason is n't even that their corporate tax is lower than for example in france , but that companies like apple get away with paying close to 0 % tax though some legalese loopholes . 
  imo stuff like that should seriously go . 
  i 'm faintly embarrassed for you , though it has nothing to do with me , and i guess you do n't support those folks anyways . 
  dumbass politicians giving people a bad pr , my sympathies !, 
  you 've been all over this thread , spamming the usual t_d rhetoric . 
  have n't you noticed that it 's useless ? 
  are you enjoying the downvotes because you 're a masochist , or because you 're trolling ? 
  finally : why do you give a shit about france in the first place ? 
  it 's more in what she * did n't * say . 
  that consisted of actual solutions ... apparently she spent most of the time doing character attacks , instead of explaining her program . 
  one of the `` programs '' she mentioned is making france have a dual-currency ... business would trade in euros , workers would be paid in francs . 
  how * that * would give her an independent franc ( which is her goal ) , i have n't the faintest . 
  also , [ this . 
  even if it does n't ( which i doubt ) , better no change than a change that consists of  \u253b \u2501 \u253b \u30fd ( ` \u0414 \u00b4 ) \uff89 \u253b \u2501 \u253b, 
  can 2 million of you even physically fit into their ... 46.6 km of coast ? 
   good jobs we have a problem, 
  a lot of fascist blood , in our case . 
  yes , we were a communist dictatorship , there were prisons for wrongthink etc. 
  but comparing those two in our case is like ... comparing hiroshima and 9/11 . 
  and to be fair , now that we 're democratic capitalists ... things are still pretty shitty . 
  we went from an industrial republic into a zimmer frei republic . 
  we 're richer and freer , it 's better than in communism of course , but - poverty , corruption and such , they have n't gone away . 
  communist pigdogs just magically became capitalist pigdogs , business as usual . 
  and only one will survive, 
  nah , both the reddit admins and the wider interested parties figured out that karma and warm feels work out as good as money :p ( and wikipedia figured out a way to harness the humanity 's unceasing desire to correct other people . ),

  the government crisis from last week continued . 
  [ a lot of context here . 
  ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/supermarket-shook-croatia-konzum-agrokor-ruling-coalition/ ) shorter : + agrokor , our biggest retail and food company - 15 % of our gdp ( !! ), 
  - has been in a pay denbts crisis for the last few months . 
  government stepped in , deals were negotiated with debtors , suppliers etc. 
  ( the strategy was -  become too big to be allowed to fail . 
  and so it happened . ), 
  + plot twist : our current finance minister , zdravko mari\u0107 from hdz , was `` a senior manager in charge of agrokor 's strategy and capital markets until early 2016 '' . 
  he claims ignorance about the situation , even though the agrokor crisis has been brewing for years ( at least since 2014 ) , and * everybody knew * , including my grandmother and her dog . 
  + more context : hdz ( right wing ) and most ( = bridge ) have been the ruling coalition for little less than 2 years . 
  most is the junior partner ... a party that 's a bit like macron 's en marche !, 
  ( kinda neutral 3rd option that came from people that were n't much into politics before ) . 
  the first combination of hdz+m ost fell apart in less than a year , we had new elections ... for the same result . 
  ( we 're slow on the uptake here . ), 
  + 3 of most ' ministers gave a vote of no confidence to mari\u0107 . 
  the hdz pm fired them . 
  the vote then went to the parliament ... 75/75 , a vote short to dismiss him . 
  then there was a fight about the speaker of the parliament , most ' leader petrov ... he resigned . 
  + so the coalition fell apart , most is opposition now , there was talk about new elections ( 3rd in 2 years , we really do n't need this shit now !, 
  ) , but hdz managed to corral ( buy ) enough other small parties for a majority . 
  + local elections coming up soon ... what fortunate timing . 
  + meanwhile , sdp ( left wing ) , the main opposition party , is lead by a fellow that posts a lot of idiot-selfies on twitter and is about as credible as corbyn . 
  + send help pls . 
  i 'd take anschluss at this point ...
