  i 'm only half-joking about that . 
  edit out the nationality , replace with `` muslim '' or `` black '' , or for added spice , `` woman '' .

  that 's the big deal . 
  yeees , i 'm in no way surprised that this is happening . 
  or that it 'll keep happening until 2065 . 
  but it 's creepy how it 's apparently perfectly legal ... did they just actually draw the line at the old iron curtain and call it a day ?

  cia says it 's `` pharmaceuticals , chemicals , computer hardware and software , food products , beverages and brewing ; medical devices '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_republic_of_ireland#sectors ) anecdote ~ my bff says that the 3 most looked-after workers in ireland atm are : shopkeeper , cook , it nerd . 
  as already said , it 's about * what * makes the gdp , who 's doing what in europe etc. 
  and imho the industrial map ^ ^ 1 is interesting , germany and czechia come as a surprise to no-one ( just the car manufacturing is rather well-known ) , but for example romania is a positive surprise . 
  i heard that their industry is booming ( and that they 're improving as a country ofc ) , but i did n't know by how much . 
  poland , too . 
  and then the industry vs service differences between uk and ireland are funny af , and neither of those two are `` europoors '' . 
  [ 1 ] yes , i know that having a service-based economy is a thing among the developed nations , and it is in most of the countries on this map . 
  ( i just played with the colors to show the differences better . ), 
  but imho europe exporting all of its industry to china / * whomever the new china is * is n't a good idea . 
  no , i just went through all of them fast ... everything in source checks out , [ except for netherlands . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/69mwda/gdp_composition_2016_estimates_cia_world_factbook/dh7uue2/ ) all i ran into are occasional rounding errors of for example 0.1 % once you add them up . 
  france 19.4 % italy 23.9 % spain 22.4 % uk 19.2 % . 
  so those are n't enormous differences ( i had to draw the line in the map somewhere ) . 
  and just guessing off the top of my head ~ well , uk has the huge financial sector which counts for services , right ? 
  spain ... construction ? 
  italy has cars , clothes , food processing ( i think ) . 
  so i can see those giving a slight 3-4 % edge . 
  goddammit cia ( \u256f \u00b0 \u25a1 \u00b0 \uff09 \u256f \u253b \u2501 \u253b so i checked [ wiki ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economy_of_the_netherlands ) ... says it 's `` agriculture 1.6 % ; industry 18.8 % ; services 79.6 % '' , so cia shaved off 1 % from industry and 9,2 % off services . 
  though i ca n't tell what the source for those wiki stats are , all i see on a skim is more cia ... [ you 're all wrong there . 
  ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nl.html ), 
  could you go and tell t_d to stop bothering ? 
  your maymays fall flat here ... it 's rather sad . 
  huh , til . 
  i just put `` agricultural ( or primary ) sector '' cause [ wiki said so . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_sector_composition ) hmm , so definition goes `` the primary sector of the economy is the sector of an economy * making direct use of natural resources . 
  * this includes agriculture , forestry , fishing and mining . '', 
  that makes sense ... though apparently oil-economies do n't count for `` making direct use '' ( or else azerbaijan would n't have such industrial output ) . 
  probably because the oil is usually refined in some way ( in ways that ores are n't ) ? 
  idk , i 'm no economist - . - '' edit : though wiki contradicts itself in the link i shared . 
  mining is cited under industrial/secondary there . 
  [ source from here . 
  ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2012.html ) hopefully i have n't goofed the colors somewhere  ** edit ** eu average : agriculture 1.6 % industry 25.5 % services 73.6 % world average : agriculture 6.4 % industry 30.3 % services 62.6 %, 
  not `` a bit lower '' . 
  this measure is talking `` anorexic low '' . 
  [ can all your ribs be clearly seen ? 
  ] ( http://www.davidmcelroy.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/anorexic-model.jpg ) no ? 
  then do n't worry , you can still be a model !, 
  well ... by hdi , gdp , ppp etc - you are . 
  always somewhere in the first quarter of the lists ... < checks  you 're 43rd on the list of ppp per capita , out of 186 , also 36th on hdi , out of 185 . 
  so unless we count `` first world '' as only around 10-15 countries , congratulations poland , you made it into the cool kids club !, 
  ;d ( ukrainian economy is a mess , tho . ), 
  hm , not leave . 
  but complain a lot , even when it does n't make sense . 
  i think this situation with poland may be kinda similar to uk - eu was getting bad press there for a long time . 
  so if it should happen that poland becomes a net contributor at some point in the future ( imo likely , they 've been developing fast in the recent decades ) , their politicians already have the theoretical groundwork for an exit-referendum . 
  i 'm talking about my mental map . 
  same map tries to divide europe into neat lines , like a compass . 
  russia is simply too large ( it 's north , north-east , east , and almost south-east as well ) . 
  if russia is marked as east , then ... uhh , not only is east too large , romania should be south-east ? 
  but if romania is south-anything , then hungary , austria etc look awkward as central ( which they are ) . 
  i * know * that russia is east europe . 
  but i do n't know what to do with central/south-east/etc then . 
  so in my mind , russia is a `` land unto itself '' . 
  ( did you insta-downvote the earlier comment ? 
  it 's also north :d and the southern bits are almost parallel with north-italy . 
  oh , and also asia , plus if you marked russia as east , then almost half of this map is east which does n't make much sense , so - `` it 's complicated '' . 
  watching asterix and obelix ? 
  ok , then bosnia , albania and kosovo . 
  yes , obviously those countries have problems , but they do n't stem from their islam . 
  my personal impression of the bosniaks is that they 're about as muslim as my locals here are catholic . 
  they 're the `` semi-annual believers '' , as in , they go to church for christmas and easter ( or the islam equivalents ) , despite professing how very `` faithful '' they are . 
  and imo you could even argue that nazis invented the whole `` aryan superior '' thing as an * excuse * . 
  your common soldier will find it easier to kill random people if he 's been brainwashed to think they 're somehow inferior because of race/religion/ethnicity / whatever . 
  `` guys , we 'd really like to steal people 's clay and resources because we 're greedy fucks '' does n't sound very motivational . 
  and that same old story repeats itself over and over again . 
  `` we 're * better * than that lot , so it stands to reason we deserve more '' . 
  so-called barbarians in america , in india , in australia , in northern asia , everywhere . 
  they need to be * ruled by the enlightened * , obviously . 
  i see the exact same type of thinking throughout history among the cultured western euros and for example the ottomans . 
  ( and my own people . ), 
  holy war , yay . 
  no , i 've seen it on reddit , the uk-subs . 
  now that i think about it , iirc the specific context was redditors talking about how it 's a common annoying complaint in uk . 
  i take it that the word is rather racist/something-ist , and i do n't visit subs that 'd use it casually/honestly . 
  ( no idea what the uk was on about in 70 's , my folks did n't have anything to do with uk . ), 
  and you still have n't addressed the rest of my comment , or the fact that a lot of those immigrants you cite as reason are n't from the eu . 
  or are you telling me that europoors somehow became the majority of your immigrants and their descendants within the last , what , 10 + years ? 
  the number of refugees assigned to various eu countries is statistically small , barring germany/sweden . 
  eu has nothing to do with non-eu immigrants . 
  i 've seen a lot of grumbling about `` those pakis '' from brexiters in the wild . 
  inter-eu migration is eu 's fault , alright . 
  except uk could have put those 7-year-caps on `` europoors '' , and in most cases it did n't . 
  that 's telling me something about the * uk government * and its plans . 
  but of course , once the british people get angry about immigrants , they 'll say `` damn unelected eu technocrats ( like nigel farage the mep , what sorcery is this ) made me do it , i definitely do n't agree with them , no no that 's never my doing . 
  sovereignty ! '', 
  funny thing , i heard about the raj , and it has nothing to do with me . 
  that 's the name for india as british colony , right ? 
  it 's india , pakistan , bangladesh , burma . 
  ( changed to myanmar , maaan i 'm getting old . ), 
  well , i was close enough , it all split apart later . 
  look who 's talking .
