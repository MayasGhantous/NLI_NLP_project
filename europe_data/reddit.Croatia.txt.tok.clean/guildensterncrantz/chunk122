  [ we 're onto you , slovenia !, 
   as a brit , i 've got to say , we do n't . 
  how can you possibly explain brexit then ? 
  sovereignty ? 
  independence ? 
  more isolation ? 
  in * today 's * world ? 
  for heaven 's sake , the only countries in today 's world that are reasonably self-sufficient are usa and china . 
  ( by that , i mean : they could last for some years if they completely closed their borders . ), 
  and even they ca n't exactly do whatever they please , that 's how inter-connected the world is today . 
  all this talk about `` independence '' may have worked out 100-200 years ago , when most of the population was peasant joe that rarely ventured outside of his birth-village . 
  ( except it did n't even then , see endless empires and land-grabs by the bigger fish . ), 
  today , * everyone * has to negotiate for everything . 
  those with more muscle can get away with better deals , simple as that . 
  ( no , humanity has n't changed to be any less self-serving and greedy than before . 
  people get away with as much as they can get away with . ), 
  and uk choose to leave the 2nd strongest economy for the sake of ... `` independence '' . 
  well good luck with that . 
  before anyone mentions how well switzerland gets away with total neutrality : a ) they 're not as neutral as they were before , see deals with eu , and b ) switzerland found a very useful but * narrow * niche for itself . 
  that niche is n't accepting other members . 
   5th largest economy in the world , [ `` you keep using that number . 
  i do n't think it means what you think it means . 
  '' ] ( http://statisticstimes.com/economy/image/world/projected-gdp-nominal-ranking.jpg ) that 's not to say that uk is a shit rain-island , or that it 's a bad place to live , that it does n't have fancy things to be proud of . 
  but . 
  there 's the perception that the brits are snobby , that they act as if they 're still a colonial power . 
  like , the colonies and world domination went bust , and brits know that , but they did n't change their * attitude * to resemble reality yet . 
  as some irish redditor said ( in this thread i think ) - `` hello uk . 
  i could tell you things about what it 's like to be a mid-sized country negotiating with china/usa/india / etc '' . 
  personal advice from a small clay here : `` america first ! '', 
  imho the confusion stems not just from bad pr for eastern europe ( it 's * always * to the east of where the speaker happens to be standing ) , but also - russia . 
  it 's a continent for itself . 
  then caucasus is complicated too . 
  and turkey is neither here nor there . 
  when someone asks me to point to the center of europe , i 'll say `` germany '' , even though iirc the real geographical center is somewhere in poland . 
  ( or even belarus , depending on how you measure it . ), 
  [ my shitty mental map . 
  we say bih because `` i '' means `` and '' . 
  it never crossed over into english ... errrm . 
  oh god , good that it never crossed :p, 
  well ... those were giving it . 
  `` two russian banks , sberbank and vtb '' , as well as `` erste group and raiffeisenbank from austria and italy 's unicredit and intesa sanpaolo '' . 
  as for how/why they allowed this to happen , the resident economist has an explanation :  `` yet everyone , from banks and bond-holders who received higher yields , to suppliers who were allowed to demand higher prices , knew how things stood and enjoyed the ride while it lasted , '' said grubi\u0161i\u0107 , who runs a private consultancy . 
  so imo that 's wild capitalism in a nutshell . 
  profit and profit , and if the whole thing should go bust , `` well that 's unfortunate '' . 
  ( not that i 'm an extremist fan of letting the government over-regulation go wild either , * that was n't fun either * . 
  i just think that there 's nothing inherently `` responsible '' about capitalism , all it wants is profit . ), 
  but in any case , as i said , after ivica bought the overburdened mercator a few years back , only the russians cared to give new loans . 
  i guess the rest figured that they 're already in it , so ... `` hope it does n't get worse '' ? 
  the irony is that agrokor is * everywhere * . 
  if you 've ever been to croatia - or ex-yugoslavia for that matter - odds are you 've bought one of their products . 
  so we have wares that are trusted , and are being sold every second . 
  suppose the banks trusted in the market share ... ... it 's kind of like : well if you 're a bank , you 'll probably look differently at some small-time or untested business looking for a loan , and * wallmart * . 
  this is our wallmart ( and monsanto , and xyz ) . 
  ladies and gents , witness exhibit 25768 : a redditor that has no clue about the soviets , or communist dictatorships in general , unironically compares the eu with soviets . 
  unless they 're `` neoliberal democratic communists '' . 
  i 've seen equally nonsensical arguments on the internet : , 
  til what cromulent means ( or not , apparently there are layers of irony here ) :  anyhow , why does it rub you the wrong way ? 
  edit : hmm , my comment was caught in some filter . 
  edited the usual suspects out , it should be visible now . 
  anyhow , sorry for the delay . 
  oh , i do n't think agrokor will tank . 
  the grand strategy was `` becoming too big to be allowed to fail '' , and that 's how it 'll go , the small fish can die , something as huge as agrokor is rescued . 
  the worst that can/will happen is : maybe certain healthy parts of agrokor will be sold off to pay some of the debts , but ... consider how long companies like jamnica , ledo , konzum , tisak , belje etc etc have been around . 
  consumers trust them , only a moron would let that kind of good pr die . 
  as for `` other parties '' , well most is basically it . 
  we 've had hzd and sdp as the main parties since independence , with hdz winning more often than sdp . 
  problem is , it 's getting harder and harder to tell the difference between them ( * social * democrats , my ass , there 's noting social around them , and both are sold to the capitalist pigdogs ) , so we have the same `` political illness '' that can be observed in usa , france etc. 
  ( most is * kinda * like macron , actually . ), 
  and so far ... they did a lot of talking , little action to show for it ( if you ask me ) . 
  in any case , according to polls , hdz 's lead is bigger than in those last two elections ( imo that 's why plenki is acting so bossy with most ) . 
  not sure who i 'd even vote for if the elections happened soon . 
  \u017divi zid is chemtrails-conspiracy-theorist , most is meh , and if i vote for sdp/hdz in 2035 , it 'll be too soon . 
  [ pametno , maybe . 
  [ relevant polandball !, 
  tbh i do n't see much reason to change that . 
  it 'd be like , idk , changing every single piece of ( predominantly usa 's ) software because we do n't like trump . 
  or even sillier , tossing out the metric system because we do n't like france ( ? ), 
  anymore for whatever reason . 
  ( politicians come and go , who cares . ), 
  and learning a new language up to the level we 're conversing in right now is * hard * . 
  in school , i spent almost as much time on german as i did on english , and yet my english is * light years * ahead of my sorry german . 
  this is n't because my schooling was bad , but because the only way you 'll get anything more than a very broken-foreign-language is by immersing yourself in it ... that means internet , music , tv , books , movies , etc etc. 
  ( or by going abroad for a year or so . ), 
  j.k.rowling 's 700-page * harry potter and the order of the phoenix * taught me more real english than the rest of my schooling combined . 
  plus , it gets harder the older you get . 
  our 50 + year olds , their english is usually very lame , cause they focused more on german/italian/russian as kids/teenagers . 
  and this is after english has been miss popular here for around 30 years . 
  tl ; dr : why bother ? 
  and if we 'll bother , can the french output as much music and tv as usa does ? 
  my rough impression of that system is - it 's like that because it 's trying to be more fair to the smaller/less populous states . 
  afaik it 's kind of like the eu parliament , smaller countries have a proportionally bigger vote than for example germany ( if it was n't for these proportions , we may as well not show up because what are our 4 million votes worth ? 
  ) , but on the other hand the bigger countries still end up having more sway once you add all the seats ( for example france and germany are still perceived as being dominant , because well - they are ) . 
  so it 's sort of a compromise that does n't make anyone 100 % happy , but does the best that can be done so that the situation is n't totally unacceptable to anyone . 
  iirc ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) , the usa 's system is like that because they also started as a federation , so they had to offer * some * insurance to the weaker `` fly-over '' states that 'd otherwise get steamrolled by the two coasts . 
  ( though if that 's so , imho it may be time to do away with it . 
  c'mon usa , you 've been * united * for centuries now . ), 
  are you pulling my leg ? 
  english is the trade language , the internet language , the tech/it language , the main tourism language , the - by far - main language of tv , cinema , music , * everything * . 
  we 're talking in english right now !, 
  eu did not make that happen .
