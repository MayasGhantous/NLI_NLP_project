  uk did n't even make that happen , sure they had colonies , but so did the french , the spanish and so on . 
  * usa made that happen * ( i blame/give credit to hollywood especially ) , so the discussion about `` which language is native in eu '' is useless . 
  let 's not play stupid here . 
  juncker , less enthusiasm please . 
  you 're not making the rest of us learn french . 
  english has been the main international language for decades , brexit butthurt is n't going to change that . 
  for those that want a somewhat shorter version : + the [ agrokor ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agrokor ) food and retail concern employs 60k people and rounds up to around ** 15 % of our gdp . 
  ** that 's a few % lower than our total tourism-share of gdp . 
  + it spread its tentacles to slovenia , bosnia , serbia and montenegro as well . 
  + been expanding too fast , taking loans to buy more and more stuff . 
  typical pigdog capitalist greed . 
  + after they bought the slovenian mercator in 2014 ( iirc ) , same mercator that was seriously indebted , nobody wanted to give new loans except for russians . 
  + the whole house of cards crashed around 2 months ago . 
  government stepped in to take over the story ( the boss , ivica todori\u0107 , left the company ) , deals were made with suppliers and creditors , etc etc. 
  + plot twist : our current finance minister `` was a senior manager in charge of agrokor 's strategy and capital markets until early 2016 . '', 
  he * pleads ignorance * about the situation , even though it 's been brewing for years and * everybody knew * , including my grandmother and her dog . 
  + our current parliament and government have a ruling coalition : hdz and most . 
  most is the smaller partner . 
  3 of their ministers gave a vote of no confidence to the finance minister , mari\u0107 . 
  the hdz pm fired them : '' d + then the motion to relieve him of the minister role went to the parliament ... 75/75 . 
  one vote short to dismiss him . 
  he 's staying , even though 50 % of the parliament does n't want him to stay , because we 're not a grown-up country here , `` shame , what 's that ? '', 
  + and now the speaker of the parliament , most ' leader petrov , has resigned . 
  coalition is falling apart . 
  + it 's possible hdz will corral another few small parties for the majority it needs . 
  otherwise it 'll be our 3rd election in 2 years ( !! ) . 
  + the opposition , left-ist sdp , is in shambles . 
  think * corbyn * . 
  hdz will win these elections ... again . 
  probably not with a majority , so that means we 're back to where we started 2 years ago : hdz winning , needing coalition , coalition is likely most/someone too disagreeable to hdz . 
  + ** we really do n't need this shit now , economy only just started recovering . 
  hmm , well the loudness can be obnoxious in itself . 
  plus my general impression is that you 're perhaps a bit * too friendly * , not even so much about getting into personal space , but more like - `` less enthusiasm please , i 'm getting exhausted just trying to follow the chatter '' . 
  but imho it 's better to be `` too friendly '' than being grumpy/complaining every other minute etc. 
  basically , at worst - you 're harmless  ps . 
  the constant and too-big tips certainly make you endearing : , 
  thanks , ofc search did n't find it cause of different title ... 
  ca n't find it in this sub, 
  anecdote : so two of my friends spent a year working in london through erasmus . 
  their tl ; dr conclusion was : `` the brits do n't discriminate . 
  they hate * everyone * equally '', 
  may be a matter of the dictatorship being home-grown ? 
  all the others were russia 's chew-toy . 
  so they were more invaded by others than we were ? 
  the worst we 'll do when seeing a black man is * stare in wonder * , like the hillbillies we are . 
  could n't into colonies , ca n't into euromonies , do n't have them here ( . _ . ), 
  i see your education has paid off . 
  * your only direct neighbors * are canada and mexico . 
  that 's it . 
  our direct neighbors are russia and turkey . 
  if you ca n't tell the differences between these two groups and their leadership , you 're a lost cause . 
  or if you think that iraq , syria , iran , libya etc are somehow comparable to ... 
  the only even remotely credible threat to usa from usa 's neighborhood in the last 100 years was cuba , and even that only happened because ussr put its nukes there . 
  you have n't had a significant war on your own soil in more than a 100 years , and even that was ... a civil war , usa against usa . 
  do n't bloody lecture us about `` neighborhoods '' when you border 2 oceans . 
  i have n't been paying attention to it for years ... and then one day , a random aussie redditor was cheering about eurovision , `` omg will we win '' , etc etc. 
  they seemed really into it . 
  so i thought `` well i guess it 's not a totally irrelevant competition ? '', 
  and now i 'm following it again because * fuck logic , gim me hype . 
  / pol / can back the fuck off . 
  a merican living in zagreb write a bit about just that [ here ] ( https://zablogreb.wordpress.com/2013/08/28/the-problem-of-work/ ) . 
  his blog is interesting in general , cause he points out not just the flaws ( i know them all ) , but also the positives , some of which i never properly thought about ( people do n't appreciate what they have ) , and the kicker is - many of the positives he points out are lacking in usa . 
  that always gives me a strange feeling . 
  like when my friends spent a year in working in london though erasmus . 
  they had plenty of good things to say ( obviously , london/uk are much richer and just * bigger in everything * than we are ) , but they also added a lot of `` but , you also have ... [ bad thing ] '' . 
  like working 9-5 , which kinda ruins your whole day . 
  endless crowds , traffic jams . 
  certain parts of the city being unsafe ( as in , `` better not risk it '' ) after 9 pm . 
  people not hanging out much in bars/hanging out period . 
  stuff like that being good/better here , we like it but we take it for granted . 
  well , we have 28 days of paid vacation , plus 13 annual public holidays ( hopefully they do n't fall on the weekend ) . 
  maternity leave : `` 28 days before the expected day of birth , then until the child turns six months of age '' , so that 's ... 31 weeks ? 
  98 days is obligatory . 
  not entirely sure how they calculate time not at work , we have 40-hour workweeks ( ignoring the illegal overtime , that comes to extra 1-2 hours daily in worst minimum-wage jobs ) . 
  crowds usually are n't so bad that we need an extra 2-4 hours to get from/to work , let 's say another 1-1 .5 hours daily in most cities . 
  as for our misery , that 's because we do n't have enough euromonies and we 'd complain even if we had them , anyways . 
  i 've heard it said that `` us french go on a strike to complain about x , and then go home and complain about the strike . '', 
  i actually admire it in a way ;d, 
  well i can theoretically support all sorts of things happening all over the world , but if i ca n't do anything about them , i may as well not exist . 
  ( reddit comments do n't count for much . ), 
  it goes without saying that `` supporters '' in this context are french people who will vote for macron , not randoms like me . 
  well , if you 'll believe the conspiracy theorists , putinbots are by far the most capable psychological warriors :p no but seriously now . 
  i do n't think misunderstanding different countries is something just the usa does . 
  i mean i hardly get bosnia and that 's a country on my biggest border + has around 15 % of `` my people '' ... hell sometimes i do n't get the people on our coast either . 
  i just hope people think i 'm like marcon and not le pen ... oh god ... some of them thought i 'm like le pen , have n't they  :( (, 
  so is that why `` soros !! '', 
  is used as a / thread by some of these folks ? 
  i still ca n't quite figure out what 's up with him . 
  it 's like a meme in chinese that i ca n't translate . 
  well , 2022 is too far away from me to worry . 
  5 years , that 's ... obama was president . 
  my country was ruled by leftists and was n't even in eu . 
  syria was n't a problem for us , neither were refugees in general . 
  i never even heard of the term `` brexit '' . 
  ukraine has n't even started euromaidan yet . 
  i was signing up for a 2nd try at college . 
  all that seems `` light years '' of events away from now . 
  i wo n't be surprised if the next 5 years are equally `` may you live in interesting times '' ( though hopefully a positive thing instead of ancient chinese curse ) . 
  their cousins and best friends too , while we 're at it already . 
  thank you for your comment , i agree with this 100 %,
