  [ me too thanks ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68eg7v/what_happened_in_your_country_this_week_20170430/dgxy0b5/ ), 
  if she wins ( not that i expect her to , barring a country-wide unexpected and sudden identity disorder ) , they 'll get more shit than the bernie-bots . 
  president twitterbot is something that usa and the rest of europe/the world can reasonably handle ( just keep the nukes away from him ) , he 's stymied every other day . 
  le pen will call a referendum . 
  if france leaves the eu , eu falls apart , and * that * is n't something you can undo in a few years . 
  moooods !, 
  : ddd, 
  eh , is n't it more likely they 'll be salty for a few hours , and then pretend she never existed ? 
  iirc they did that with wilders . 
  i am moderately looking forward to a new remix of `` pay denbts ! '', 
  polandballs , the greek ones got stale years ago . 
  well , at least erdogan is trying to help greek tourism recently . 
  their last true friend in this world !, 
  by that reasoning , we 're never going to get visa-free travel to usa . 
  * somebody * is always going to be late . 
  * somebody * is always going to be willing to work on the black market , no health insurance , no pension , no anything , either here or in foreign countries . 
  you can always say that `` hordes '' are going to overstay on the black market , despite the fact that whole of ( relevant ) europe opened up to us in the meantime . 
  as for the hordes , i just looked up the visa-refusal stats for us , because i think it 's likely that those that get refused are refused because they 're `` suspicious '' , as in they have no significant family here , no job , etc , so they 're the ones that 'd likely stay on the black market if they physically got into usa . 
  ( my assumptions . 
  the reasoning for refusals is n't clearly explained . 
  all i can say with certainty is that `` terrorism '' does n't happen here , period , while it does happen in western europe , so there goes citing `` safety '' as a reason . ), 
  it 's at 5 % . 
  so ... you 're right , probably an increase , but not a significant one . 
  i mentioned ireland because it 's become a popular destination for our youth since joining the eu . 
  i ca n't find the exact numbers , just going off the `` state on the street '' , as in , basically * everyone * knows someone who moved to ireland in the last few years . 
  ( like my bff , 2 weeks ago . ), 
  [ old statistics ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_diaspora#statistics ) do n't tell us a lot since people have been moving from here to elsewhere in the last 100 years , regardless of visa 's and eu 's , they have n't all died off , and that 's not to mention their descendants . 
  so ... [ more recent stats , ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/item/14770-tens-of-thousands-of-croats-move-to-germany ) as in `` where the people went in significant numbers in the year of 2015 '' . 
  * germoney promised land * , to the surprise of no one . 
  overstaying in usa : bulgaria 1.74 % croatia 1.09 % cyprus 1.35 % poland 1.49 % romania 2.06 % . 
  meanwhile , random non-visa countries : chile 2.33 % , germany 1.07 % , hungary 2.92 % , italy 1.60 % , slovakia 2.36 % . 
  and it 's tiny total-numbers , too . 
  [ source here . 
  ] ( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fy%2015%20dhs%20entry%20and%20exit%20overstay%20report.pdf ) now . 
  all 5 of us go over that other threshold , the `` rejected percentage of visa requests '' , iirc it 's at 3 % . 
  and the reasoning for rejections boils down to ... 
  i do n't know . 
  being europoor ? 
  silly goose , as if people would try to get illegally into the usa black market when they can legally move to ireland . 
  this is where you 're very wrong . 
  we were assigned a quota of refugees . 
  we 're one of the few countries that actually volunteered to increase that quota , and so it happened . 
  we can not take half a million or a 100 thousand or whichever big number of `` refugees '' that refuse to stay here . 
  even the tiny number we got in the end , some 2k iirc , they refuse to come . 
  what do you expect we do , imprison them ? 
  create jobs we do n't have enough of even for our own people ? 
  and this all for a wave of migrants that ... dun dun dun ... are trying to get into germany because germany invited them into germany , without even thinking to ask whether the rest want any part in it , whether they can stop them at the borders , whether they can create new jobs for them , etc etc etc. 
  ( and yes , there 's a difference between refugee and migrant . 
  we took in hundreds of thousands of real refugees from bosnia during the 90 's war , and this was during the time our own country was at war . 
  that lot , however , was n't demanding `` more benefits '' . ), 
  and my goal is n't to punish usa . 
  my goal is getting visa-free travel to usa , which wo n't happen if we impose visa 's on them because they wo n't give a toss . 
  are you being deliberately obtuse ? 
  and achieve absolutely nothing with that . 
  as if usa would give 3 shits about some small countries imposing visa 's . 
  the point of eu - aside from better internal trade - is better negotiating position in regards to whatever . 
  450 million is stronger than 4 million . 
  ( even if germany of 82 million for whatever reason decided to wrestle with usa , they 're weaker alone than with all of eu backing them . ), 
  so the point of this threat from commission was wrestling the usa down to allowing all eu citizens to travel to usa without visa 's . 
  ( they 'll sooner back down if they lose easy access to all of eu . ), 
  for that , you need * solidarity . 
  * which is evidently lacking , as we can see , despite all the harping about `` united we stand '' , `` we 're all fellow euros '' and so on and so forth , the stuff that promotional pamphlets come up with ... not that many believe these pamphlets , and for good reason . 
  except they did n't build any of that here . 
  they might , at some point , but it 's a drop in the bucket . 
  off the top of my head , the one really useful thing that eu will mostly pay for is the new bridge we 'll be building around the bosnian panhandle . 
  aside from that , if you asked any of the citizens , our entrance in the eu hardly changed a thing . 
  tourism increased sure , but it 's been steadily increasing since the early 2000 's without the eu . 
  people move away from here more easily ( which is n't really beneficial for the home country ) , but people have been leaving this area for the last 100 years or more ( as if stricter entrance requirements like work-visa 's are going to stop the determined ) . 
  uhh ... trade increased ( i * think * ) , but we still import more than export and the real situation on the shelves ( prices , availability ) did n't change one iota . 
  and trade is all about money anyways . 
  so saying that eu is all about `` benefits '' is correct , if you ask me . 
  it 's a bit hard to build fancy non-money concepts like `` common european identity '' and `` solidarity '' with shit like this . 
  i do n't get what 's even the point . 
  `` some euros are more equal than others '' comes as a surprise to no one . 
  if the parliament did nothing , as in - if they did n't make the threats and the promises - absolutely nothing would change , and no one would care ( we 're used to shit like this , and the rest does n't care about us , business as usual , move along with your day ) . 
  but the parliament shouting a lot , those news blowing up , only for the commission to backtrack , only does this : shows that the parliament is useless , and that eu in general is a yes-man to usa . 
  ( and disappoint us 5 - `` we should have known , fooled me again . '' ), 
  how do they possibly gain anything with that ? 
  i can get it if it 's about our too-long border with bosnia that 'll take a lot of work to secure . 
  * but then again , greece 's schengen border with turkey is anything but secure because it 's impossible to secure , and that 's where the problem actually started . 
  * at the very least , we need to build a bridge around the bosnian panhandle on the coast . 
  * we 'll be doing that now . 
  * we also played hot-potato with them , not cool . 
  * everyone played hot potato with them . 
  * there are the migrant quotas ... * we actually signed up to increase our amount . 
  * then , umm ... we were n't even the ones that invited them to germany , that was germany . 
  in conclusion : for the sake of securing fort europa from migrants , we need to kick greece ( and italy ) out of schengen !, 
  or stop germany & co from inviting a million migrants into europe and then demanding that the border countries stop them from coming !, 
  yay !, 
  `` and the world gasped in shock ! '', 
   `` renting is throwing money away '' heh , but is n't it ? 
  slowly paying off some apartment you bought , sure that makes sense , no way you can buy those in cash . 
  but paying a too-big amount of money on a monthly basis for a place you 're never going to own seems the definition of burning money away for nothing . 
  most rents are almost half the minimum wage here , add the water-electricity-food-phone bills and you 'll barely have enough left to keep yourself clothed , forget saving up for something constructive . 
  i mean i get it if you get a much , much better job in a different city and you ca n't quite cover the cost difference between rent and buy ( like , the job pays 2-3x more ) . 
  or you live in a shoebox with your parents . 
  but over here i 'd say that more often than not , people have parent-houses that have at 3-5 rooms or two floors . 
  if you do n't have to move for work , it 's much more sensible to stay with them up until you can afford an equally decent apartment/house that you 'll actually buy . 
  ( or if you happen to live in a suburb like me , and you have a big garden like i do , you cash up for the construction permits , and build another house behind grandma 's for half the money . 
  and then another , for grandma 's grandkids .
