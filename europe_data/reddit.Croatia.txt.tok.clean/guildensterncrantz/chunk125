  we 're building a street here !, 
  here are my awesome calculations ~ eu 's initial rough estimation was `` 60bn or thereabouts '' . 
  our god-emperor has that dinner with may , food is bad , talks are worse . 
  may acts as if uk can leave with `` 0bn or thereabouts '' , plus wants a simultaneous fta negotiation , which would exhaust the eu negotiators to death . 
  this alarms the collective eu , because the actual money they mean to get from uk - the stuff that can be reasonably proven they owe - is '' ** 50bn ** or thereabouts '' . 
  since may and company are `` in some other galaxy '' , eu officials giggle a bit and raise the stakes to `` 100bn or thereabouts '' , since they expect they 'll get the literal middle ground . 
  either that or they think the `` people from another galaxy '' are a lost cause anyways and so they 're preparing for no deal whatsoever . 
  ( oh look , french elections coming up !, 
  we need more brotherhood and unity here , folks ! ), 
  ninja edit : nevermind , i see that you point out many of the same things in later comments . 
  but about eu facilitating globalisation ... that sounds very weird to me . 
  as in , yes i know that eu is very much for it , but i do n't think it matters a lot . 
  the destruction of industry that you mention , that happened to us long before we came into eu - around the time we adopted capitalism and/or opened ourselves more to the rest of the world . 
  our factories could n't compete , partially because they were mismanaged at the local level ( bad privatization , white-collar thieves ruining stuff ) , partially because even with good management , we 're way too small to attract the industry that 'd rather go to china for a cheaper and bigger workforce . 
  oh , and add the automatization killing a lot of jobs , period . 
  so that all mostly has nothing to do with the eu . 
  we may as well blame capitalism and robots . 
  or try to isolate our country , have everything produced locally , force the locals to buy only local stuff , regardless of price and quality ... yeah , no . 
  off the top of my head china and usa are the only 2 countries that could be even remotely self-sufficient ... not that they are . 
  look at the usa 's rust belt losing jobs . 
  ok , here 's from me ~ jobs are going the way of the dodo . 
  all those blue collar workers that lost their jobs ( and those are not coming back ) are creating social/political trouble already , with good reason . 
  and assuming that we do n't all blow ourselves up in the next 50-odd years or destroy the environment to the point we have a post-apocalypse ( at which point discussions about income are moot ) , robots are coming for 99 % of the jobs . 
  no , new jobs wo n't be invented to replace them , even the stuff we think is bot-proof like teacher , doctor , artist , event organizer etc etc will eventually go . 
  and most of us plebs are n't capable of being artists/doctors/etc anyways . 
  so all you 'll literally have is the 1 % employed that oversees the top-bots , and everyone else . 
  unemployed . 
  ( capitalism is n't designed to deal with this , all capitalism does is try to maximize profits , and obviously bots will be more profitable . ), 
  so basic income wo n't even be a matter of discussion , it 'll be a necessity . 
  only this wo n't happen all at once , the issues of rust belt voting for trump will repeat themselves over and over again , in increasingly damaging forms . 
  at which point do we call it a day and accept some literally-commie-utopia ideas , lest we anger the increasing numbers that fall into the cracks , which will probably end up in violent revolutions that 'll take humanity backwards ? 
  ( and how will this world without jobs even work ? 
  like ... will we all have `` hobbies '' that we 'll post to reddit-lookalikes for karma ? 
  will karma become the meaning of life ? 
  + are you a muslim ? 
  + are you a communist ? 
  + are you a communist muslim ? 
  + give us your social media passwords !, 
  + what do you mean you forgot your passwords ? 
  + how can you not have facebook and twitter accounts ? 
  yes , and most russians that i 've seen around here are welcome to comment . 
  however , anyone that uses this as an argument :  eu , on the other hand , is going to absolutely annihilate romania , make it a giant retirement home where no voices of children are heard . 
  after that eu elites would probably try to populate this no man 's land with mahmouds fron middle east , i guess . 
  ... is not looking for a constructive debate . 
  if he was american , he 'd be told to `` keep his shit to t_d '' , and rightly so . 
  * and breaking up the eu . 
  afaik the saudis at least are n't openly trying to cripple usa 's economy , smash it into small parts , etc. 
  nah , serbia just dumped them here after hungary made its fence work . 
  then we played stupid and dumped them to slovenia ( and hungary , till they made another fence ) . 
  then slovenia passed the hot potato to austria , and then the noise got so bad that eu allowed macedonia/serbia to close their borders , which was done quite effectively . 
  and the turkey deal only came afterwards , to relieve greece who was shut out from the rest . 
  so it 's closer to orban complaining a lot ( for good reason imo ) , nobody listening , orban raising some fences , the rest being pressured , the wave reaching the western euros , and * that last bit * did the trick . 
  in my expert opinion , we should all go back to trading in kind . 
  in other news : i 'm selling an overgrown greedy tomcat ( fluffy belly included ) for a trip to berlin . 
  any takers ? 
  i 'll even transport the bloody wretch !, 
  ... both are all about money ? 
  and the point that i was arguing anyways was made a few comments earlier . 
  to that point , a said `` bad history '' , and b said `` lazy comment '' . 
  so i assumed that b disagreed with the `` bad history '' part . 
  or , as you say , b made a comment with little value or sense . 
  well , of course they have things to lose . 
  that is , no matter what eu does , it has a net loss , same for uk . 
  but the context of this guardian piece is the dinner and the `` fundamental differences '' between eu and uk . 
  and this is n't even a matter of eu being mean `` just because '' . 
  brexit will be hard enough to negotiate to be as painless as possible within the time-frame of 2 years . 
  yet now uk seems to think that we can negotiate a fta within the same already-short time ? 
  it 's frankly ludicrous . 
  south korea and canada took 7 & 8 years to negotiate a fta . 
  i do n't see uk shortening that to basically * less than 2 * ( less than 2 because parallel negotiations ) . 
  i do n't know what may & co are even thinking . 
  blustering , which wastes even more time ? 
  thinking uk will have special rules that do n't exist for anyone else , by law ? 
  or do they think they 'll walk out with the worst possible no-deal and therefore they 're already selling it to brits ? 
  europe without eu is a chew-toy or a yes-man to bigger powers . 
  cold war , basically . 
  ( except for those countries that nobody cares about , but that 's not a good position to be in either . ), 
  / r/ukpolitics [ was n't very happy with that dinner either , ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/68kwhh/the_uk_government_is_completely_deluded_about/ ) and they 're touted as the `` more balanced '' splinter group . 
  europe is europe because it got rich at the right time . 
  it was n't exactly a haven for cultured thinking , unless you count `` colonizing the rest of the world and stealing its resources for industrialization '' as cultured . 
  or `` going to war with each other every other tuesday '' ... up to the point where we leveled most of the continent in wwii , which is one of the main reasons we 're not the biggest fish in the global world anymore . 
  as for progressive values , * spare me * , that happened in the last 100-odd years , talking about europe being progressive in middle ages is nonsense . 
  ( in fact i 'd argue that of all the euro empires , austro-hungary is the only one that can say it got big through fine pursuits like political negotiations , instead of eternal war-anschluss . ), 
  as if we fought the arab/ottoman/etc invasions because we did n't like how they were `` more barbarian '' than we are . 
  we fought them because everyone always fights whatever invader ( which was other euros for most of our history , interestingly enough ) . 
  but that 's based on the assumption that those that pirate would otherwise buy the stuff . 
  i do n't know about you all , but * i * would n't . 
  because i 'm europoor , and the content is not accessible to my small money . 
  20 years ago , i did n't have much music in my house , because i could n't buy it then either . 
  well , correction , i 'd tape some songs on radio , but that 's piracy too . 
  point is , i did n't * own * music then . 
  nowadays i do n't own music either , and i have thousands of songs . 
  so under those prices , i 'm not a `` lost customer '' either way . 
  all that pc 's gave me is better access to everything . 
  and i 'm neither stealing physical copies of the music , nor making any money of the pirates i `` steal '' , as in i 'm not doing anything like taking away the patent ( a large concern for people that get their research stolen by other companies and stuff like that ) . 
  finally ~ i 've talked about this with my american internet friends . 
  they do n't pirate much anymore ... simply because `` it 's too bothersome '' . 
  because they 've already gotten affordable and quality services that are * legal * . 
  on the contrary . 
  i 'm not going to do research on dozens of different countries , especially since such research usually consists of poring through dry wiki summaries that do n't paint the picture well , disorganized political news and/or touristic promos .
