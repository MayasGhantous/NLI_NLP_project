  threads like these give me interesting tidbits , people who visited or who live there summarizing the picture in non-dry words etc. 
  [ omg how could you forget the epic sax guy :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy1b3aggnxw ), 
  iirc the general tl ; dr is that macron wants more federalization , while cameron wanted to undo a lot of federalization that was already done . 
  i know that feel bro ; - ; pigdogs took all potato , do n't even have euromonies to go to germany and properly steal their cars !, 
  back in the good old days , you did n't need a lot of money to steal cars , you just became a member of the politburo . 
  we did n't like that system anymore !, 
  no ... for the hundredth time , percentage of votes and odds of winning are n't the same thing . 
  most serious polls put big odds on clinton winning , but they also acknowledged it 'll be a very tight race . 
  voters predictions were n't actually very off , a few percentage points iirc . 
  macron is different . 
  it 's not the odds of him winning , but again the voters predictions , that have him in a very comfortable lead , by some 20 % iirc ( so very different than some 5 % or less like clinton had ) . 
  and the same pollsters that say so have predicted the first round within statistical error . 
  `` sexist ? 
  the bible ? 
  no what are you talking about , there 's virgin mary ! '', 
  - the reasoning of most of the women i confronted about that . 
  virgin mary , whose only accomplishment in life ( as far as i can tell ) is ... never having sex . 
  * how inspiring . 
  oh , for sure . 
  it 's just that since a peaceful split was off the table , i 'm not convinced we should have stayed in that increasingly-shithole country , even in hindsight . 
  by instinct i 'd go with `` no , everything is better than that war '' , but then i again think of putin/erdogan/etc , and i wonder if i would be willing to take up arms to be free of them , if there were no other options . 
  imho if yugoslavia somehow miraculously had n't split apart back then , nowadays we 'd be the belarus of europe . 
  fuck that . 
  * you 're and you 're pushing a narrative of `` only leftists are cult-like '' , a statement that makes no sense whatsoever . 
  cultish behavior can be found in more than one side of political spectrum . 
  in fact i 'd argue that the left-wing is more scattered about and unable to organize itself into some kind of cult-like dank maymay propaganda group , than the other way around . 
   ** you would n't download a car ** ... uhhh , we could discuss that assumption . 
  idk about his father ... my grandfather had to baptize his sons in some village in the middle of nowhere , and then hide the fact that he did it , because he wanted to get a job as a schoolteacher - that 's just one of the `` benign '' examples of how things worked . 
  then you had imprisonments that followed protests like [ this one . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_spring ) also our very own equivalent of `` siberia gulag '' - [ goli otok . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goli_otok ) ( if you ever hear someone from here randomly commenting `` goli otok ! '', 
  in response to some shadiness , now you know that the half-serious context is `` these criminals need to get sent there '' . ), 
  so in response to your earlier statements about how yugoslavia was better than the wars that followed ... ehhh . 
  yeah peace is theoretically always better than war ( because war sucks for all involved , obviously ) , but this case is closer to asking `` if there was no other way to overthrow erdogan outside of war , would war be worth it ? '', 
  not necessarily .

  the person that tried to comment may have been caught in one of the modqueue filters ... may be a baby-account , or has negative karma , or linked to some banned site , triggered automod with some phrase ( for example the n-word is common among many mods ) and such . 
  extremism . 
  both extreme-left and extreme-right . 
  you may as well call them stalin and hitler , if it makes things clearer . 
  how does one even be extreme-centrist ? 
  `` we 're * violently * moderate '' ? 
  ( does that even exist ? ), 
  true story : as an english-deficient kid , i thought `` man it 's so cool that treat is named after our city ! '', 
  there goes my childhood : <, 
  yeah i do n't know either . 
  apparently he 's pushing against the `` serbs bad '' narrative ? 
  all i know is that whenever the 90 's come up , someone will go `` but wait , in wwii this happened ... '' imagine if france/poland invaded germany in the 90 's and cited wwii as `` reasoning '' , lost that 90 's war , and then kept going on about wwii whenever it 's brought up . 
  this was actual reasoning , in fact . 
  slobo 's narrative was `` we 're rescuing our minorities from the evil neo-fascists '' . 
  shirtless vlad just copied that gimmick recently , if you ask me :p as for  agenda being `` we were all in love and peace blah blah blah until very very very evil serbia started killing everyone :( '' rank nonsense . 
  yuga sucked in many and myriad ways , and we 've been trying to [ get more autonomy ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_spring ) for a while .

  i doubt you 'll find the hammer and sickle anywhere ;d but the type of architecture ... there are [ brutalist monuments ] ( http://www.cracktwo.com/2011/04/25-abandoned-soviet-monuments-that-look.html ) all over ex-yu .

  what gives , silence ? 
  [ ze germans , obviously :p ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4v2cpk/angry_croatian_locals_burn_towels_left_on_a_beach/ ), 
  and that bit of wisdom happened centuries earlier because ragusa ( dubrovnik ) and venice did n't want to border '' * those people * '' , so they ? 
  gave a strip of coast to the ottomans , because that makes * perfect sense . 
  * [ non-italian side of the adriatic is of many interesting . 
  [ here 's my other comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/68k3py/serbia_to_adopt_repressive_srebrenica_genocide/dgzd1yj/ ) explaining the difference between war crime and genocide . 
  ethnic cleansing follows the same logic , the * intention and planning * from the army/state/group of people to exterminate/chase away another group of people is what matters in both . 
  otherwise every single war where civilians die or flee would constitute as ethnic cleansing/genocide ... ... which is literally every war . 
  for example , a lot of civilians ran from osijek once the siege started . 
  that does not make the siege `` ethnic cleansing '' , regardless of whether these civilians had reason to be afraid , or what would have happened to them if the city fell . 
  probably similar stuff to what happened to vukovar , where ethnic cleansing did happen , and we can prove that because the vukovar civilians - croat civilians , so that 's why it 's * ethnic * - were forced out with arms . 
  now . 
  war crimes did happen to the serbs that stayed . 
  the perpetrators of that are still being prosecuted today . 
  however the bulk that fled ( by same reasoning as those that fled osijek ) were n't ordered to do so by croatian politicians or generals , they were n't forced to do so with arms . 
  ( the army covered 630-km front in 4 ( ! ), 
  days , just picture those logistics . 
  they were rather too busy securing areas of military importance to * bother * organizing those columns . ), 
  the serbs got the order to evacuate by their own leaders , and they did so . 
  * intention . 
  * since the difference between genocide and ethnic cleansing is in whether the people are killed or chased away , here :  in february 2015 , at the conclusion of the croatia -- serbia genocide case , the international court of justice ( icj ) dismissed a serbian lawsuit which alleged that operation storm constituted genocide , ruling that croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country 's serb minority , though it reaffirmed that serious crimes against serb civilians had taken place . 
  the court also found that the hv left accessible escape routes for civilians . 
  according to the judgement , serb civilians fleeing their homes , as well as those remaining in un protected areas , were subject to various forms of harassment by both the hv and croatian civilians . 
  so there you have it . 
  crimes were committed , but the planning and the goal of that operation - the intent - is n't there . 
  and it was n't . 
  however . 
  do i think that tu\u0111man and everyone else did everything possible to reassure the serb civilians ? 
  to protect them ? 
  did they feel very sorry that the z-4 plan was outright rejected by the sao krajina authorities , same z-4 that would give krajina similar rights as to what republika srpska got ? 
  definitely not . 
  everybody was rather too busy celebrating the fact that croatia was n't gutted in the middle anymore to feel sorry about the fleeing serbs . 
  but that 's neither here nor there when we 're talking actual deeds vs the fallout ( `` oops '' , he said innocently , `` i never told them to do that '' ) . 
  if you want a longer version of how the `` warlord balkan '' stereotype is n't true , [ i actually went on a rant about that a while back . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/657x5f/a_strongly_worded_letter_to_the_western_europe/ ) part i is the listing/comparison of wars ( west euros take the cake , definitely ) , part ii is comparisons about the current issues in eu and the then-issues in yugoslavia . 
  plot twist : the eu problems are eerily similar but still nothing in comparison in scale , that war/breakup did n't actually come about because `` balkans amirite '' . 
  does n't china also apply ? 
  not mao 's horror , but modern china is at least communist on paper . 
  they just adopted `` being rich is actually good , comrades '' because they were smart enough to adapt . 
  which means they 're not exactly communism as it `` should be '' , but then again nobody was . 
  you 'll bring a symbolic sum of euromonies , yes ? 
  deal ?
