  i can tell that when it comes to the `` dozens of srebrenicas committed upon serbs during wwii '' , they 're called genocide . 
  because they are genocide . 
  they 're just not called separate instances - the dozens - because they were all part of one policy . 
  as i said , i agree that using a single pic to prove an argument is weak . 
  at least you should link court sources in such contested cases . 
  or idk , actual war footage which is much harder to fake , lord knows we have a lot of that . 
  but your point that those pics are contested because `` someone on internet says '' they 're actually from vukovar is also not helpful . 
  `` someone on internet '' will also say that holocaust did n't happen , and they 'll use that to deny every single piece of photography/footage/etc etc. 
  and this is actually the 2nd time i 've seen that outrageous `` source '' spreading horseshit . 
  if / u/derloladin goofed with a weak argument , your dismissal of it should n't have been even weaker . 
  aside from using a single pic in an argument being lame ( it is , i agree with you there ) ~ you have any source for those links that happens to be more legit than ... someone 's blog ? 
  and a * forum * , of all things ? 
  preferably blogs and forums whose `` source '' is n't broken links and yet more blogs/forums ? 
  actual police/even army reports would be helpful . 
  now i am familiar with revenge killings happening during that war . 
  but it 's ... odd ... that you mention vukovar , since the vukovar defenders were mostly dead to a man by the time vukovar fell . 
  ( most of the rest were either captured or massacred . ), 
  `` november 19 , 1991 '' ? 
  * vukovar fell by november 17 . 
  * [ it was controlled by jna . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vukovar_massacre#timeline ) `` neo-nazo skull crushers '' ? 
  ohh ... those fine sources you linked also go on and on about `` albanian organ thieves '' , presumably they 're `` jihadist albanian organ thieves '' , because why not . 
  ** your source ? 
  as far as i can tell , it 's about the heaviness of the word itself . 
  people immediately think `` holocaust '' when you say genocide . 
  because obviously they do , and just as obviously nobody wants to be associated with that ( extra troublesome because one of the foundations of republika srpska would then be literally hitler ) . 
  but genocide is misunderstood by * meaning * . 
  numbers mean nothing , only the intention to exterminate a certain ethnic/religious/etc group of people . 
  for example , france and germany go to war and millions of civilians die . 
  but the aims and the plans of that war are n't extermination but for example annexing each other 's clay = not genocide . 
  ( war crimes , yes , every civilian death is a war crime . ), 
  another example , turks set up an extermination camp for kurds but only manage to kill a few thousand . 
  it 's about * intention * ... though apparently some debate even that , cause women mostly were n't killed . 
  ( though they were raped , and war-rape was mostly done with the goal of them getting pregnant , which iirc counts as genocide too . ), 
  can we stop it with the storm = genocide/cleansing narrative ? 
  it 's been debunked by every court that pieced the facts together , and it 's frankly tiring . 
  they were literally [ ordered to evacuate * by their own leaders . 
  * ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operation_storm#4_august_1995 ) now we can argue about why they felt they need to leave before/as a military action happened ( military , as in , army vs army which is perfectly legitimate seeing as that army happened to be illegally occupying 1/4 of our territory ) until we 're blue in the face . 
  but if civilians running away from battlefields is genocide , maaaan my own city was genocide 'd and i never even knew that . 
  tbh i think it actually is n't . 
  looks very striking ... you may even say , [ meme-worthy . 
  huh . 
  checked , you 're really right , slovenia is n't listed for precious , precious [ sarma .

  well . 
  usa preaching about anything at this moment would only backfire , trump is perceived as a perfect embarrassment of american politics ( started with bush , dignity-coffin was nailed shut with `` we 're gon na build a wall and make mexico pay for it '' ) . 
  if trump endorsed candidate a or action b too much , people ( especially young people ) would by default squint at said candidate or action . 
  as far as i can tell about the non-eu balkans , eu has a bit more street cred than usa does ... so even just not congratulating vu\u010di\u0107 on making serbia even more of his mini-fiefdom would be helpful , * thank you very much * . 
  silly fellow , we 're not sending anyone , we 're hosting the event in our beautiful city of king 's landing . 
  ( wait . 
  i do n't even know which comment you 're responding to . 
  in any case , i 'm talking about cleganebowl . ), 
  not so sure about some of your arguments . 
  that is , i do n't believe that uk will somehow turn into an irrelevant little shitcountry like some doomsday-prophets think . 
  but . 
  i think the real picture when it comes to economy-size is n't in the rank , but [ actual gdp in comparison to others . 
  ] ( http://statisticstimes.com/economy/image/world/gdp-nominal-ranking.jpg ) so that small-ish uk trying to negotiate with big china ( or usa ... pardon my english , `` america first ! '' ), 
  has substantially less muscle in comparison to [ whole eu negotiating . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/timeline/1b048b3d89f40c18fbae2983995dd452.png ) it also remains to be seen how much investors will want to get into uk after it does n't have easy access to the rest of eu anymore . 
  not sure about army sizes etc. . . 
  i would n't be surprised if usa dominated that one as much as it dominates economy . 
  ( which is why nato is usa-by-default , and also since eu countries put together would make for a respectable army , why not federalize that bit ? 
  we 're usa 's yes-men atm . ), 
  so ... you do have some advantages . 
  ( like a respectably big population of workers/consumers , many know-how 's etc. ), 
  but the way you 'll be negotiating with usa/china/india / brazil will need to be very different . 
  nah , i understood you right . 
  i 'm agreeing and adding to your comment , since it was rather short and has long chains of disagreements ( not sure where to add mine in that , so i 'm `` hijacking the top comment '' so to speak ) . 
  how does it go ? 
  absolute tolerance ends up destroying tolerance ? 
  it 's like turning the other cheek . 
  following that policy , at some point some lunatic will end up killing you . 
  the lines get blurry , but i 'd say that protecting `` free speech '' , even up to the point that * some of that speech * advocates for taking away the rights of other people , is insanity . 
  it 's ... group a advocates hideous violence . 
  the rest , being sane people , shut them up . 
  group a cries `` this is violence !! '', 
  it 's like robbers and murderers crying about `` that police is taking away our rights !, 
  i have a right to commit violence ! '', 
  25 elections later , we might finally have a government that 's worth the name !, 
  \u266a ~ \u1555 ( \u141b ) \u1557 but in more important news , [ sanity returns to the borders , yay !, 
  ] ( http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_statement-17-1182_en.htm ) tl ; dr : slovenia and croatia will switch to selective checking of ~ ~ potential terrorists ~ ~ tourists bringing euromonies if the queues get longer than 15 minutes . 
  reading over it again , yeah the article is vague . 
  but in context , slovenia ( unjustly ) got a lot of heat for the queues , from all the tourists trying to pass . 
  and then it 's bad for everybody 's tourism . 
  so both countries begged for mercy from eu officials ... this is basically it . 
  i doubt slovenia will want to create hours-long queues `` for whatever reason '' . 
  no ... what ? 
  i read that as : when the waiting time gets too long , we switch to selective checking , and tell the commission we did that .
