  if it was the other way around , as in [ tell commission the crowds are big , wait for them to decide ] , they lines would be half-way through slovenia by the time they decided . 
  this is supposed to be a quick release-valve . 
  cause the lines got up to * 5 hours * long during easter holidays ...  . <, 
  finally watching it . 
  on part4 right now ... hmmm . 
  wish the subtitles were a bit better . 
  that is , they get the gist most of the time , but it 's sometimes different in * shades * from what was actually said , you know ? 
  shades matter in politics . 
  not sure why they shortened the translations by up to 50 %  . < but this is mostly what i knew or vaguely `` knew '' , just very detailed , ordered and from the horse 's mouth , so to speak . 
  i 'm actually mildly surprised bbc got everyone to be so talkative , especially in '95 when everything was still so raw . 
  and i did n't actually know that montenegro * almost * left back then . 
  ( wish there was a follow-up some 5-10 years later , would like to see what that prez would say about the final fallout . 
  same for kosovo , it 's sort of poetic that it started there and mostly-ended there . ), 
  one correction/inaccuracy by omission that i noticed so far : our checkers coat-of-arms is waaay older than wwii , first appeared in 1495 , was even used in the yugoslav coat of arms , so making it the official reasoning is ... odd . 
  ( leave my checkers alone !, 
  the nutters are nationalistic . 
  the rest either does n't give a fuck , or despises this place , and that 's why so many of them are trying to leave for greener pastures . 
  i think if you added that all up , we 'd be below zero in how much we `` love '' this country . 
  which is n't a good thing either , self-hate never gets people anywhere . 
  he broke the bank of england once , has a history of predicting economic crashes , usually supports usa democrats which makes him the eternal enemy of t_d types , usually funds post-commie transformation , pro-democratic measures , pro eu-federalization , not afraid to criticize trump , bush , orban , brexit , etc etc. 
  he 's also a ( ( ( rich jew ) ) ) . 
  you may be onto something . 
  hmm ... no stache on tito . 
  [ lots of style , tho ' ] ( https://i2.wp.com/www.portalnovosti.com/img/media/image/tc4h1hwg7r8j2wq01om2f1al78x.jpg ), 
  are you listening to me ? 
  i upvoted your post for visibility , but here i 'm telling you that croats in general are so pessimistic/grumbly that if you gave them a swiss bank full of gold , they 'd look for hidden mines . 
  so at least one of the `` concerning '' examples you cite in your post does n't hold water . 
  also , i suspect that greece and italy are the same . 
  source : [ they do n't believe in their own countries either . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/683y3l/eurobarometer_2016_trust_in_eu_euro_support_eu/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage ), 
  and i 'm sure that if you asked the croats whether our country would actually notice if we happened to lose our government , around 67 % would say no ( along with `` why do n't we just exile them all to siberia/goli otok '' ) . 
  in fact , we did n't have a government for some months a while back , and the country barely noticed . 
  around 23 % would also complain about the general state of the country to the point that you 'd think we 're living in the middle of congo . 
  94 % would wonder `` who took my potato ?? '', 
  around 17 % would vote for a chemtrails-conspiracy theorist and eternal-bachelors-student in the first round of the presidential election because `` fuck the police '' ( this actually happened ) . 
  if 50 % of the people can be bothered to vote for anything , that 's a respectable turnout . 
  also , you forgot to mention that 15 % think our membership is a bad thing ( the same chemtrails folk , i suspect ) , while 47 % are neither here nor there ( nothing much changed since we joined ) . 
  and no political party would ever let a referendum like that even happen . 
  so hold your horses :p, 
  you 're talking about kinggeorgecommands , are n't you ? 
  [ they could ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-re-enter-eu-boat-post-brexit-uk-european-commission-jean-claude-juncker-a7622726.html ) though iirc they could n't keep the special benefits like the pound and not being in schengen anymore , basically they 'd be treated like every other member . 
  wait i 'll try to find source for that ~ edit : ok i do n't feel like searching anymore . 
  [ this article sums up what i said , ] ( http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-article-50-leave-eu-europe-rejoin-join-again-how-sacrifices-we-would-make-a7656571.html ) though i ca n't find any official sources in eu saying it like that . 
  all i 've got is a lot of noise about [ `` no more special treatment in general '' ] ( http://www.politico.eu/article/angela-merkel-no-special-treatment-for-brits-uk-brexit-eu-relationship/ ) , in terms of brexit itself and uk after it leaves . 
  wait . 
  do you think i 'm on the side of what uk wanted ? 
  or that i think brexit is a good decision ? 
  ( for both sides , i think both uk and eu will suffer for that , just remains to be seen how much . ), 
  because i 'm not . 
  and many of the uk complaints never made much sense to me in the first place . 
  for example eu has nothing to do with non-eu immigrants , that 's uk 's decision ( refugees are a statistically tiny number ) . 
  then uk did n't even implement those 7-year ( iirc ) caps on eu immigration very often , unlike other eu countries . 
  as for polish citizens and better goods : how much do they benefit if their own industries fall apart because they ca n't compete with western goods , and they ca n't even protect their industry with customs anymore ? 
  and so they lose their native manufacturers and jobs , so getting easier access to for example german cars is moot point . 
  that 's the other side of the story . 
  that is not to say that poland does n't benefit when you add up all the numbers , or that uk was somehow a loser when you add up the same numbers . 
  what i 'm saying is that we should not act as if the eu is made of parasites and noblesse oblige benefactors ... and insult each other 's intelligence while we 're at it . 
  ahh ... poe 's law strikes again . 
  well at least for what it 's worth , in my observations of this sub , it seems that the people who cry hitler at you are rare/downvoted to oblivion . 
  it 's the few idiots that are a lost cause . 
  orwell citations , on the other hand ... seeing them from people who have no idea what communist dictatorships look like is rich . _ . 
  ... it appears you 're serious . 
  or you 're taking my first eurof\u00fchrer comment seriously . 
  i hate putting / s at the end of un-serious statements ... perhaps i should have invoked some dystopian novel or a dank putin-meme to make it clear that i 'm agreeing with you ? 
  people who blame everything on germany are ridiculous , so calling you eurof\u00fchrer is pointing that out/mocking them further . 
  because `` hurr durr , eu is 4th reich , hide yo children ze germans are coming !!!! 1 ! '', 
  [ yes yes , and now do something about this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lklmahm.png ), 
  * well what else can you expect , mein eurof\u00fchrer ? 
  * edit : for the preservation of poe 's law , and so that my lame sarcasm skills do n't cause undue confusion : ** / s **, 
  if by benefits you mean eu-funds , then yes the periphery is more agreeable because they get more funds . 
  brain drain ... debatable who it benefits . 
  [ trade ] ( https://i.redd.it/b4p0azuuy0oy.png ) [ ... ? 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/yczaktmxvzny.png ) everybody harps about how poland is draining the euromonies , the infamous 80 billion they got in some timeframe i do n't remember , maybe 10 years . 
  and yet in the same timeframe , germany * alone * sold 50 billion worth of products in poland . 
  because smart people have realized ages ago that you ca n't sell anything to the dirt poor , the rich that are looking to expand their sales help the poor become less poor . 
  let 's not act as if anyone is in the eu because we 're bleeding hearts , not the poor and certainly not the rich ( you do n't get rich in the first place by giving away your wealth to charities ) . 
  we 're all here because it 's more convenient to stick together than it is to try to be a too-small state in a too-large world . 
  oh yeah , we basically get one german for every two croats living here . 
  dat towel-anschluss is real !, 
  [ we 're barely fighting back , help us pls :o ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/4v2cpk/angry_croatian_locals_burn_towels_left_on_a_beach/ ), 
  just the weapons-manufacturers . 
  the rest just lose too much . 
  this is getting armchair-philosophical , but i think a big part of that is the differences in economy now and for example 200 years earlier . 
  back then , you basically needed just the peasants , right ? 
  mostly uneducated workforce doing simple ( r ) jobs , so it made some sense to literally steal each other 's clay , kill those that complain , and that 's that . 
  ( plus food/resource production could n't keep up as much with minor population booms , so if you were a psychopath , war was another way to cull the herd , so to speak . ), 
  nowadays ... you ca n't exactly replace all those engineers you murdered in a twinkling , no ? 
  and if you kill enough of the workers that keep the state running , you end up with a no man 's land like half of the middle east , so * good luck * trying to extract something from that burning wasteland . 
  and as i said , the rich and powerful have less reason to go to war because they realized they can get rich much easier with pigdog capitalism than with outright annexation . 
  so people may not have become much more * moral * , but they did advance in technology and logistics . 
  tl ; dr : basically , we have n't been saved by philosophers and bleeding hearts , but by * nerds * inventing stuff . 
  science bitch !, 
  i do n't even know why i never used that before as a res-tag !, 
  * thank you * / u/godutchnow , my tags do n't suck as much anymore !, 
  [ on that note , here 's no time for caution . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3zvvgjrtp8 ) you 're welcome !, 
  oh , i also think we 'll see a multi-speed eu . 
  not much else you can do when certain members constantly drag their feet , and you do n't want to un-democratically strong-arm anyone ... though i have my reservations on what it 'll do to the divisions of europe . 
  on that note , did you look at the maps ? 
  here 's [ trust in eu .
