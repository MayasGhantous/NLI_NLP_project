  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kbgfpjk.png ) note that the west is more distrustful than east . 
  ( aside from greece , who 's fucked in every way . ), 
  [ here 's euro-support . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/i0me49l.png ) oh look , denmark and sweden , traditionally thought of as `` western '' , are quite against it , more than anyone in the east ( including greece ) . 
  oh ... look who has a literal `` let 's break the eu '' presidential candidate in the 2nd round ... it 's france . 
  ( not that i expect that she 'll win , but still . ), 
  uk already left . 
  wilders gained ground in netherlands in the latest elections . 
  let 's not pretend that east/west is actually significant in any important way anymore . 
  not even * orban * is threatening to burn the whole thing down . 
  i , too , find that deciding on the future of my country is helped with reddit threads . 
  has n't let me down yet !, 
  you can look at the latest [ kurzgesagt video ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxuty7ss1v4 ) for that . 
  to expand a bit ~ my impression is that many of the eu-critics seem to think the eu is somehow naive , too soft in the head or heart , etc. 
  you can see that on the first example of `` eu funds issue '' , people act as if the richer countries pay for the development of the poorer out of the goodness of their hearts ... when in fact , you ca n't sell anything to the dirt poor . 
  if you 're rich and you want to get richer , you need to look for new markets . 
  so the west/north was n't born yesterday ( it benefits them ) , and it should n't act as if the east/south was also born yesterday ( we know west/north benefit , so enough with the `` why do n't you shut up and be grateful , poland '' ) . 
  on the more general example of peace post-wwii ... that 's complicated . 
  people argue that nato , cold war , and nukes are the main factors that ensured peace . 
  ( as well as europe leveling itself to the ground and thus being unable to continue warring . ), 
  but nukes did n't stop war in general , israel most certainly has them and they 're still threatened constantly . 
  also war-deterrents being armies ( `` invading us will be too costly !! '' ), 
  has been tried for thousands of years before that , and it never worked . 
  there 's no such country that 's too difficult to invade given enough preparation , crazy propaganda , disregard for human lives , alliances of smaller countries against a bigger one . 
  ( see : * the german problem * for more info . ), 
  but ... if we go with the premise that most war is motivated by greed ( for other people 's clay , workers , resources ) of the leaders , we come to a different solution . 
  * tie their wallets together . 
  remove borders , so that workers and resources can move more freely . 
  integrate these economies to the point that a war is a total-money-loss for everyone . 
  * and this is why the eu was born . 
  it just started gently , with steel and coal . 
  you 're wrong because you 're trying to shorten the conflict to some simple narrative of `` ha , migration is bad ! '', 
  yes , it is bad when the migrants form enclaves and refuse to assimilate , when they basically become something like `` a country within a country '' . 
  however , that ignores economic concerns ( it was so bad that at times people were only allowed to drive every other day because `` gas shortages '' ) , constant inflation , large external debts , differences between poor and rich countries ( who benefits unfairly , who pays for the yugopoors ? 
  ) , the fall of the soviets making the `` neutral yugoslavia '' suddenly irrelevant ( there goes the foreign investments ) , the fact that the state was a communist dictatorship that imprisoned wrongthink the way that erdogan does today , etc etc etc. 
  it 'd be like trying to boil down all the current eu problems down to `` immigration '' , when it 's just one of the dozen factors . 
  well , at least it 's a shade better than blaming it all on religion xd, 
  i think we have a misunderstanding here . 
  to explain in as short words as possible ... 1 \\ . 
  yes , i agree that members who drag their feet are no good for eu . 
  i think everyone can agree that eu needs a measure of reform , for example you ca n't have a single currency in such disparate countries doing whatever they please with finance . 
  so , in that case more integration is needed , and uk was usually against integration . 
  merkel can say whatever , what matters is how things work out in practice . 
  see the refugee crisis for example , we were anything but united in that . 
  more integration ... eu army , perhaps ? 
  personally i 'd like that , easier to trust my fellow euros than usa-led nato . 
  however , half or more of eu is n't interested in that , i do n't see that changing with uk being out . 
  `` who pays for all that ? '', 
  this is very relevant , easy to be cheerfully united when the economy is doing well ( or improving , in case of europoors ) . 
  uk was iirc the 3rd most important net contributor to funds . 
  so eu losing that is painful . 
  if france gets out , we may as well all pack up and go home , as if germans will be willing to hold up the whole thing on their lonesome . 
  ( yea , i know that for example netherlands are also a contributor , but the problem is - they 're a small country . ), 
  also , [ these maps . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/683y3l/eurobarometer_2016_trust_in_eu_euro_support_eu/ ) uk is n't even the most distrustful country . 
  side-note , this also works as an answer to / u/bristlerider for [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/688x5p/eu_27_agree_brexit_negotiating_stance/dgwq2gf/ ), 
  wait a moment . 
   the review was supposed to add financial resources to policy areas seen as crucial by the eu ( minus britain ) , such as securing external borders ( it foresees an additional $ 2.5 billion for projects such as the eu coast and border guard , a new entry-exit system , europol and the eu 's asylum agency ) , new partnerships with african countries ( $ 1.4 billion ) and contributions to trust funds for libya and syria . 
  all of which will be delayed as a result of the british move . 
  borders , africa . 
  those are things that need doing * yesterday * , yet the uk is delaying it because ... because they have n't had enough elections in the last 2 years ? 
  because they do n't give 3 shits about what happens with the immigrant routes to europe this year , cause same immigrants are `` somebody else 's problem '' ? 
  check and check . 
  what horrid behavior , indeed . 
  i 'd have preferred if they stayed and cooperated more . 
  but since i ca n't have that ... well , it 's not like the eu is very united in values , no ? 
  or at least , maybe we have similar/same values , but we ca n't agree on how to go about doing many things . 
  point being , [ the brits whined a lot , ] ( https://youtu.be/wdqayc1sr7g?t=1m21s ) but at the end of the day they were a big contributor to the eu ( and not just in eu funds ) . 
  ... is this just banter that i 'm reading wrong , or do you genuinely believe this is n't a big loss for the eu ? 
  [ it feels relevant for the first time in my life ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqw4w9wgxcq ), 
  nah , just [ half of slovenia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_croatia#arrivals_by_country ) . 
  we love you too !, 
  ^ ^ ( and & nbsp ; is & nbsp ; the & nbsp ; weather & nbsp ; shitty ? & nbsp ; are & nbsp ; you & nbsp ; protesting ? & nbsp ; :p ), 
  depends on how you look at it , i guess . 
  czechia in 2003 was cheaper for me than croatia at the same time ( for example same lunch was 30-40 % cheaper ) . 
  greece in 2005 was 1,5 times as expensive . 
  then in 2006 coffee in stuttgart was 1,5-2x as expensive ( depending on the bar ) . 
  not sure about others ... except that bosnia is eternally cheap for us . 
  if the prices did n't change much ( or at least , not in relation to each other ) , we 're then somewhere in the middle ? 
  like , halfway between germany and maybe romania ( ? ) . 
  but , all this comes with an asterisk : the tourist-traps will rip you off totally . 
  we 're talking `` go two streets further away from the center of the city and prices fall away by 200 % , what sorcery is this ! '', 
  [ yeah my source-comment sank for some reason . _ . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/683y3l/eurobarometer_2016_trust_in_eu_euro_support_eu/dgvh2q9/ ), 
  not even just basic , some of those sources had fairly high-advanced info on it . 
  good enough for bachelors , anyways ... and i somehow doubt that regular people check the wiki in an argument about a master 's . 
  i usually trust it because it turned out to be true in every single argument i ever got into before ( this is after comparing the references ) , and because humanity has the unceasing desire to * correct other people * . 
  the most ~ ~ grammar ~ ~ fact-nazi folks flourish as wiki-editors :p, 
  europe has been at war with itself for thousands of years , for every conceivable ugly reason in the world . 
  this stopped after wwii ... except it did n't , not really . 
  the cold war was n't a peace , it was a nuke-fueled stand-off between usa and ussr , and the fact that those nukes did n't get fired and turned europe to glass is more a matter of * luck * than it is of peace and safety . 
  or in other words , if usa and ussr had decided to go to wwiii , there 's nothing anyone else in europe could have done to prevent that . 
  so the notions of `` independence '' among western euros during the cold war are delusions . 
  they were just lucky that their `` patron '' was more patron and less `` dictator '' , like what happened to the eastern block . 
  ( i guess you could call yugoslavia `` neutral '' . 
  it 's not an accident that it fell apart after the soviets were n't relevant anymore . ), 
  as for following orders in general - let 's even ignore war . 
  economy , then . 
  people have to negotiate to trade , obviously . 
  and just as obviously , those with stronger economies - those with stronger decks - have more power in such negotiations .
