  only sadness , such commieblocks . 
  are n't you a warzone and/or waiting in bread-lines ?  etc etc. 
  there 's this perception in the west that balkan = afghanistan , so nobody wants to be called that . 
  * he did it the absolute / r/madlad !, 
  fwiw random internet people got the feels for portuball ? 
  he 's * adorable * and all those jackasses with delusions of grandeur are just picking at him , not cool !, 
  \\* insert accordion music *, 
  ok , for some perspective in regards to bih , `` the 2013 census found a total population of 3,791,622 people in 1.16 million households ; 585,411 fewer people than the 1991 census . '', 
  and that was 2013 , i expect the disastrous emigration continued in the last few years . 
  everybody that can is leaving for better countries , so : who will be fighting ? 
  and with what army ? 
  as if russia would send their own army to win , what , some empty mountains with no coast ? 
  it seems to me that people talk about the balkans as if we 're still in the 90 's , so that 's why western media gasps at every single political trolling as if another major war can even break out here . 
  the major combatants in the 90 's were croatia and serbia , with bosnia caught somewhere in the middle ( and sort of having a third side , except this third side was pretty under-armed for a long time ) . 
  our `` glorious army '' looks a bit [ like this ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b0/15/10/b015100ed893704bacdbeacb28fd2391.jpg ) today . 
  and most of the people do n't give three shits about any of our neighbors , or glorious nationalism , * because we 're mostly looking for a job * . 
  this is a big contrast to the mood in the early 90 's . 
  if the eu somehow fell apart , or nato went defunct , imo the more critical areas would be russia 's immediate neighbors like the baltics with their `` oppressed russian minorities '' . 
  good . 
  the us feral honey bees are practically extinct , and our euro bees are n't doing well either , because of the winning combo of habitat loss , mite parasites , and pesticides . 
  and i can sort of get farmers who want to use pesticides for better crop production ( though apparently that may be a myth ) , but - `` it is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects , birds and bats , most of which is accomplished by bees , whether wild or domesticated . '', 
  ^ ( eu gib euromonies for bees , yes ? 
  dad said he 'll even drive his bees around . 
  rent-a-bee ? 
  tbh i do n't get how so many can say that eu made europe weaker . 
  if the question was `` did it make europe more prosperous '' or idk , fast to move in some issues , or simple , or even if the question was about some eurozone/refugee issues ( but that 's assuming refugees would n't move through europe if there was no eu , which does n't work the moment you notice they moved through serbia & co and they care about germany/sweden , not the eu itself ) , i 'd get it . 
  but * stronger * is a pretty simple question . 
  it goes ~  q : would usa/russia/china give three shits about your country and what it wants if your country did n't have most of the continent and its economy backing it ? 
  i 'd get it if most of those thinking the eu makes them weaker are from germany , or uk , or even france ( though their position is debatable too ) . 
  but it 's like the rest think they 'd be like switzerland without eu . 
  * only switzerland can be like switzerland . 
  bah , the last that i remember of seeing that nut was the latest presidential race , where he got something like 5-6 % in the first round , * behind the eternal student who believes in conspiracy crackpot theories * . 
  so that 's how much support he and his ... schtick ... have from the public . 
  in regards to the priest quote , to me it looks like he meant to say `` yea all them dying ones , well better to call the priest for them '' . 
  which i should n't be able to read from a government official !, 
  in regards to abortion , rightest-wing nutters tried to make a run against it , constitutional court ruled that as un-constitutional , they tried to gather steam for a referendum to change the law/constitution , the constitutional court ruled that as un-constitutional too \\ ^ ^ so it 's not happening . 
  as for firing him , it depends . 
  tbh our government has so many ministers and changes them so often that til this nutter is in charge of health atm . 
  so , it 'll come down to how many people notice , what he tries to change , how many care . 
  the only ministers they fire are those that come under heat , or those that disagree with the rest of the party/pm .

  hm , how do you see it , honestly ? 
  ( jokes aside , ofc comics like this will have exaggerations . ), 
  i do get a sense of reluctance to lead from germany , but then again at other times it seems your country takes the lead either because others are too distracted/dysfunctional , or there are disagreements in the union and then the strongest voice prevails by default ( this may not be fact , but it is perception ) . 
  i find that `` you 're balkan mate , no sense denying it '' and `` are n't you alpine croats '' are more effective . 
   he started a dictatorship-lite with full control of all but few media 's this is probably a dumb question , but how `` legal '' is this ? 
  and i do n't mean a thin paper cover ( `` see , we 're technically not breaking any laws !, 
  '' ) , if just about any pleb can notice that vu\u010di\u0107 & co are seriously pressing against media freedom , surely the better informed politicians can know about it . 
  as far as i can tell from this post , and the earlier info - the opposition can hardly run against vu\u010di\u0107 in any substantial way ( c'mon , we 're not counting tweets as substance ) . 
  because this all seriously sounds like putin ( or erdogan-lite ) , and yet serbia is at least theoretically trying to get into eu , which does n't compute if the sitting government has a visible dictatorship over the freedom of speech . 
  and the presidential term is 5 years , so - what ? 
  does vu\u010di\u0107 not care about adding another 5-year-setback ( on top of all the other setbacks , chapters that need closing ) ?

  turkey ca n't into eu the same as estonia ca n't into nordic !, 
  also , poor baltics . 
  they 're the only ones behaving and keeping their mouths shut , and they get `` xaxaxa '' behind them as reward :o, 
  it 's top thread on polandball when you search for `` ordnung '' , and one of my all-time favorites . 
  [ thread here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/polandball/comments/2rarii/for_the_sake_of_ordnung/?ref=search_posts ) i 'm still kinda confused in regards to `` tomato sauce on mi box '' - is it mafia/blood ? 
  or something in regards to pasta and italians being triggered at heathens who put ketchup on it ? 
  hm , well at least when it comes to history , off the top of my head you have the macedonian dispute with greeks ( how related was alexander to modern-day fyromians and greeks ) and also the issue of whether they 're south-slavs or bulgarians , also how slav/not-slav bulgarians are in the first place etc. 
  then there 's some confusion in regards to bosnia too , maybe not that much in terms of accepted scientific history , but more like `` it is known '' general knowledge that depends on whom you ask . 
  i can also imagine issues arising from russia and its neighbors , with the more recent soviet/pan-slavism which tended to mean `` no we 're all slavs which means * we 're all actually [ nation x ] '' . 
  * and afaik the whole migration period is confusing/has missing records and such . 
  for example , we 're `` slavs '' here . 
  but what does that even mean ? 
  iirc genetically we 're very much related to the indigenous population that was here , which means romanized illyrians , probably ? 
  and then the slavs came and imposed their language and culture . 
  except it 's also disputed how much of an imposition that was , iirc there was the example of the burial practices which were apparently unchanged .

  ( \uff89 \u25d5 \u30ee \u25d5 ) \uff89 * : \uff65 \uff9f \u2727 \u2727 \uff9f \uff65 : * \u30fd ( \u25d5 \u30ee \u25d5 \u30fd ) in regards to the eu institutions ~ one thing that seems relevant to me is : the past month and half i spent on this sub did more to bring eu/its institutions/various european countries closer to me than the past few years of being `` in the club '' did in general day-to-day stuff and even the parliament elections . 
  now of course that 's mostly my own fault , politics in general bore me/depress me ( be they local , or the usa elections you could n't escape from ) , so i avoid the topic most of the time , or just do n't bother researching it in detail . 
  but still , it 's a bit odd [ this comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5x2hqr/eu_parliament_to_vote_on_visa_regime_for_us/deezpgz/ ) feels like a more reasonable/relevant summary of the eu political structure than a million official pamphlets/websites we got upon joining . 
  i do n't know if it 's a failure of the local politicians , or eu structures , but judging by how many people from various countries rant about the `` byzantine structures of eu run by faceless * unelected * bureaucrats '' , it looks like the problem is pretty widespread . 
  ditto for the lamest politicians being sent to brusselles , as you point out , that should really stop asap , especially since at least over here people generally have more faith in the competence of the eu than our local politicians . 
  ( i hear that the same applies to greece etc. ), 
  oh , i heard about that , how swedes do n't check for ufo 's but russian submarines . 
  ( also referring to russia/russians as `` ivan '' , for some reason . ), 
  is it a meme , or for real , or both ? 
   people say you can love europe without loving the eu . 
  perhaps you can , but without the eu , most european nations are mostly distant strangers that really do n't affect somebody 's day-to-day life in any way . 
  for us , the `` relevant '' folks are our immediate neighbors in ex-yuga , then austria , hungary , italy and germany , and after that usa , russia , china , and turkey , because of various political/cultural/economic ties . 
  when it comes to travel , we could do that for a long time , * assuming we have the money for it * , which is hit-and-miss . 
  trade - yes , it 's stronger now , but it 's not like the eu invented the concept of buying german cars ( in that sense we 're closer to made in china than whatever random european nation ) . 
  odds are that i 'll never even visit all - or even most - of eu countries in my lifetime . 
  what * changed * is that now we 're a member of the `` club '' , so that means that what for example swedish politicians vote for in the eu structures like the parliament does affect me now much more than before ( however indirectly ) , so i feel like i should pay more attention to what 's going on in sweden , how random swedes think and live etc etc. 
  but without that , they 're just a pretty distant nordic country that has little to do with me . 
  yes , yes , but you 're an honorary slav anyways !, 
  it 's mostly because you tend to group with is in various statistics , also [ this obligatory polandball , see the language comments ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bpxf5tv.png ) ), 
  i think it goes like - well , car crashes and similar accidents are a fact of life , they happen fairly randomly , so our brains do n't register them as an active danger . 
  because if you were afraid of accidents , you 'd never leave your house , and there 's not much you can do against this randomness anyways . 
  while terrorist/motivated violence , that has a clear `` logic '' behind it , and we feel like we can predict it - `` do n't walk in that part of the city late at night '' and so on . 
  and so even though i 'm more likely to be run over by a drunk driver in my own backyard , i hear news about targeted violence in berlin/london/brussels / tel aviv and i instinctively go like `` gaaaah , better not risk it '' , even though the risk is statistically small ( er ) . 
  i 'm partial to erdolini . 
  it just rolls !,
