  if usa/china came around to make a trade deal with croatia , and it was us alone against them , and we did n't like the imbalance , we could do literally nothing about that . 
  same china just moves along to a different country . 
  but , if the deal is between eu and china , that 's a different story entirely , china obviously has more desire to get in such a large market , so they 'll agree to a better deal . 
  and finally , about the guns : look at how many eu countries care about that . 
  the answer is : they just do n't , so czechia is outnumbered , as it happens in every single democracy . 
  i do n't care for many of the decisions made by my own government either , but i just have to deal with that ... it 's either `` dealing with it '' , or moving to some abandoned island . 
  i 'd rather follow orders from germany/france , than from usa/russia/china . 
  china is n't exactly a good example of values . 
  russia , that never goes well . 
  usa ... 
  i doubt most of them even know my country exists , while i do n't have the same doubt for germany/france . 
  plus , the numbers are different . 
  usa is strong enough to dominate any of the european countries ( yes , even germany/france/uk ) . 
  `` america first ! '', 
  meanwhile , those stronger countries in the eu are surrounded by many , many small ones , so while for example germany could do a lot of harm to croatia alone , it 's different for example against croatia + czechia + hungary + poland . 
  and meanwhile , put us all together into one eu , and you have something formidable enough to deal with russia/usa/china , * just in case it 's needed * . 
  without the same eu , all everyone in europe is - chew toy , or yes-man . 
  right , that 's the most surprising part imo . 
  euro is generally well-supported in the countries that were the worst hit by the financial crisis ... my best guess is , greece/spain/portugal / italy are more dependent on tourism than usual , and money exchange is one of the million factors that can make a tourist decide to not come to your country ? 
  i wonder if schengen-support would have similar values ... and meanwhile trust in eu is generally lower in same countries . 
  so it probably goes like `` common currency good , but politicians need to make better decisions '' ? 
  weeell ? 
  update ? 
  seeing as i have n't heard about any deviant acts occurring in front of our parliament ( general government nonsense inside is a different thing ) , i assume your trip went alright ? 
  well of course i dun goofed somewhere !, 
  finland is missing in euro , though i updated the imgur post itself , not sure how to make res/reddit display the update without users going to imgur . 
  [ here it is , finns like euro too . 
  well would n't belgium then also have lower trust ? 
  it 's comparable to poland . 
  germany 41 france 28.5 poland 51.4 belgium 49,2 . 
  and then you have italy 33.7 , so terrorism does n't quite apply again . 
  ( the refugees in general , maybe . 
  italy and greece are the busiest in how many come in , though i 'd hesitate to make any conclusions on greece , the only thing they believe in is euro - not even their own government has their trust . ), 
  idk ... if there are any patterns i can see on these maps , then it 's : countries that do n't have euro hate euro the most , and ... * maybe * countries that like eu democracy have more trust in eu . 
  and it 's odd that france and germany dislike the democracy when their voices are the loudest , while the more `` peripheral '' members seem to like it more . 
  same here . 
  though grandpa repurposed a few for nuts and bolts . 
  similar here . 
  that is , we 're not as cheerful as you are , but as you can see we believe more in the eu democracy than in our own politicians ... which is an `` awesome '' achievement , seeing as we hardly see any eu politics ( while we see too much of the home grown kind ) . 
  getting us into nato and eu is one of the few good things the governments of the past 20 years did , it 'd be suicide if they tried to take us out . 
  yeah apparently it 's 59,2 % for you . 
  i guess you could look at it this way : italy is one of the founders of eu , and the anti-euro folks are at 40 % , so maybe that 's why you hear a lot from them ? 
  plus your stats are fairly low on the whole , highest for euro , then eu democracy 47,2 % , trust in eu and home democracy at 33.7 % . 
  so ... umm . 
  are you italians people who generally complain a lot ( i feel for you ) , or is the general situation in italy and italy within eu rather bad ( i kinda feel for that too ) ? 
   for me it 's incomprehensible why would anyone want to join euro now . 
  it 's all the same to us . 
  our currency has been religiously following the euro ( and before that , deutsche mark ) since its inception , no significant devaluation & co were ever done . 
  most of our large borrowing and savings are in euro/usd/etc . 
  also switching would help our tourism a lot . 
  against that list of whatever 's and pros , you have the * theoretical * devaluation ... that we 'd never do cause our debts and savings are in outside currencies . 
  may as well \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  but ... why ? 
  the only countries that dislike the euro in any great measure are those that do n't even have it . 
  even the super-skeptic france and greece like the euro . 
  as for general euroskepticism , almost everyone has some measure of it . 
  give it another 25 years and we 'll be finally rid of hdz !, 
  euro is strange . 
  you 'd think its support would be lower because of the crisis , i heard everyone and their grandma complaining about how `` you ca n't have a single currency in such disparate economies '' . 
  yet it seems to be doing well even in greece . 
  also something that 's less visible because it does n't apply to all : it seems that those countries that have a low trust in home democracies believe in eu democracy more . 
  map information taken from this [ bruegel study ] ( http://bruegel.org/2017/03/european-spring-trust-in-the-eu-and-democracy-is-recovering/ ) , you can easily flip between countries in figure 3 . 
  no , you 're using senseless buzzwords . 
  your comments are almost the equivalent of saying `` no '' , with no explanation or point . 
  ... checked your profile ( you never know when t_d may strike again ) . 
  omg , [ random orwell !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/682apv/theresa_may_d%c3%a9couvre_le_principe_de_lunion/dgv60bb/ ) you do realize that if eu/the west are anywhere close to popular dystopian works , then it 's * brave new world * , not * 1984 * ? 
  1984 was written as a communist parallel :p, 
  i assume you 're speaking from intimate experience with communist dictatorships - and specifically , the soviet communist dictatorship - so therefore you have a point when bringing up the soviet union in a conversation about the eu ? 
  in fact , do enlighten us . 
  i 'm all ears :d ( i 'll give you props , at least you did n't go straight for hitler . ), 
  so the thread died down so probably only you will see this ... but anyways ~ uh , we did n't get a state after wwii . 
  we got more of yugoslavia , which was n't exactly sunshine and roses and everybody should be able to acknowledge that ( communist dictatorship , cough ) . 
  and even in wwii , let 's not forget that the partisan movement started in croatia or that tito was a croat ( though again , nobody is saying that serbs did n't make up a substantial percentage/majority of that army , at least in the beginning , or that you were n't by far the biggest victims of ndh ) . 
  but us not getting the right to independence after wwii was * right * , you do n't get to whine about commie oppression after going full hitler . 
  it took another 50 years of bad karma and slobo going full retard , leveling vukovar + shelling dubrovnik ( yeah we 're `` lucky '' that dubrovnik is unesco world heritage site , because the outsider 's press cares more about pretty monuments than human victims ) for us to get the `` right '' to independence . 
  it 's like ... imagine france went to aggressive war with germany in 90 's , and this is after germany being under 50 years of shitty dictatorship where some countries are `` more equal '' than others . 
  ( point being , yuga post wwii was closer to soviet union than the shiny west , brotherhood and unity my ass . ), 
  and this french-german war is ugly , unjust , and it has some dubious motivation from french in the first place . 
  french lose , and then they keep muttering about wwii whenever it 's bought up . 
  my grandfather was a partisan ... my father and uncles were defenders in 90 's . 
  gramps is dead , the rest are not . 
  i do n't remember wwii , but i remember my osijek being besieged and shelled . 
  * it 's really not helping in the `` blame-game '' . 
  [ meet belize ;d ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/flag_of_belize.svg/1280px-flag_of_belize.svg.png ), 
  true story : once i joined this sub , ofc i ran into some people with that flair . 
  for just a few seconds i was overjoyed because `` omg i can get my beloved pineapple for flair '' , and then `` whaaaa ? 
  ... impostors !! '', 
  and that is how i met noord-brabant . 
  think of zoki as the equivalent of president twitterbot . 
  ( we even replaced him !, 
  with hdz !, 
  \\* laughs hysterically * ), 
  uhh ... no . 
  yugoslavia was a communist dictatorship that imprisoned wrongthink the way erdogan does today . 
  the way that hiring for jobs went is ~ so my grandfather finished his college , wanted to get a professor 's job . 
  for that , he needed to completely hide the fact that he baptized his sons , and he also needed to be a good little communist , hiring went by `` who you know '' instead of what you know . 
  nobody owned anything so nobody tried very hard , and everybody stole . 
  the country was up to its gills in debt . 
  a ton of its earlier economic `` progress '' only happened because usa & co were pouring a lot of money into the neutral buffer-zone .
