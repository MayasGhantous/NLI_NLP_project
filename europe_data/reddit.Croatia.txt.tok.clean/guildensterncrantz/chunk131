  [ same economy finally broke in the 80 's . 
  ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/archive/fullsize/econ-module-yogu-gdp-chart-8_b2af6c1915.jpg ) and that 's before we even come to the political clusterfuck of the 80 's ( for context , imagine what would happen if for example poland hijacked half of the votes in the eu council and then said `` veto veto veto '' ) . 
  it was n't all bad , `` comrades '' did some good things . 
  but on a whole that state was even more artificial than the eu , and it did n't even have the benefit of being a mostly-prosperous democracy like the eu . 
  leaving was the correct decision . 
  well ... at least polandball gives you a cool eyepatch ? 
  ( but seriously now , how did your flag happen ? 
  never googled that , tl ; dr ? ), 
  [ unless you 're niger :p ] ( http://i.imgur.com/vonkuek.png ), 
  not excuse everything , but they certainly did n't help . 
  i mean just look at the differences between the areas held by them , and for example austro-hungary . 
  but i could go on and on about reasons ~ always had small population , so those wars that we did have , like the world wars , had a greater impact . 
  you do need a certain concentration of people for large-scale industry etc. 
  then the clay we have here is mostly lame . 
  take croatia for example ... we have the sea , that 's useful . 
  italy who happens to be next to us has ** 4 ** seas . 
  rivers are nice ... except they flood constantly and turn the land into a swamp . 
  fertile soil in the north ... but not much of it , and southern soil is mostly useless . 
  impassable mountain ranges separating the two . 
  no oil , no gas , no ores ( or at least not a significant amount ) . 
  oh and let 's not forget the shifting of trade to the atlantic just as the industrial revolution started . 
  no colonies to fuel the industrialization either . 
  it goes on and on . 
  i mean of course out wrong `` life choices '' throughout history did n't help , same goes for the quitters-attitude . 
  but it 's not like getting rich is n't easier when you happen to be a more-isolated and well-positioned island like the uk who also stole some sweet , sweet colonies full of resources . 
  have i mentioned the colonies yet ? 
  for the millionth time : are we talking refugee or immigrant ? 
  refugees have no reason to refuse to stay , we 're a perfectly safe country . 
  but now that i think about it , the tiny number of immigrants assigned to us by eu ( less than 2k , iirc ) also have no reason to refuse to come here , we can certainly take care of so few people . 
  they 're not refusing to stay/come because croatia is even close to being the kind of shithole as the countries they came from , though they 're certainly * acting like it is * . 
  they 're refusing for the same reasons as they 're refusing to stay in czechia & etc , they want * germany * . 
  and as far as going to germany for quick euromonies goes : `` get in line ! '', 
  what what what is that monstrosity < googles  < it appears nobody is taking that proposal seriously  bloody hell you scared me for a moment !, 
  meh , `` balkan silly place '' is common wherever i go on the internet . 
  maybe not from you personally , but the stereotype of `` backwards warlords '' is alive and true . 
  but i 'm talking more about internalized hate . 
  let 's say something corrupt/wrong happens in nordics ( lord knows no country is immune from corruption ) . 
  they 'll be out in the street , protesting . 
  same thing happens here , everyone just shakes their heads , saying `` well of course , it 's balkan '' . 
  it goes like : why even try when nothing ever changes , easier to abandon ship and move to germany . 
  people here are mostly divided into two camps : blind nationalism that always blames `` someone else '' for the problems , and those that utterly hate the place they were born in . 
  neither helps . 
  ottomans invading did screw things over , but nation x invading nation y was regular tuesday for most of european history everywhere . 
  ( aside from ottomans and venice , we were actually more peaceful than for example nordics , france-uk and so on . ), 
  then communism was bad , but it was actually worse in most of the eastern block than in yugoslavia ( and you do n't hear `` hurr durr eastern block unstable '' ) . 
  `` balkans amirite '' is a popular narrative both here and elsewhere , sure , but i think it serves a different purpose . 
  it goes `` well yes of course your country is corrupt , but what did you expect , you 're balkans amirite . 
  now stop complaining . '', 
  yeah my opinion is sort-of divided on flags . 
  on one hand , people say that the rule should be : can you draw it by hand in 5 minutes ? 
  and that makes some sense , but on the other hand there 's only so much variety you can get if all the flags are so simple . 
  in the end i decided i like our pineapple : has a crown made of 5 other coats-of-arms , [ allows something this * fabulous * to happen ] ( http://airshowinfo.hu/en/img/blog/varazdin/2.jpg ) , [ the jokes are endless ] ( http://i.imgur.com/96cgl4t.png ) etc etc ;d, 
  bah , ask anyone from balkans , and they 'll tell you all about how we actually live in the middle of congo . 
  and they 'll probably go on that rant while on their daily 3-hour coffee break . 
   it was also dumb that our government more or less endorsed macron because that 's an argument le pen can use against him . 
  how can she use it against him ? 
  `` oh look , our most important neighbor does n't want me winning !, 
  yay we 're gon na build a wall and make germany pay for it ! '', 
  i mean if that sort of argument works on french voters ( `` let 's piss off all the people that matter '' ) , they 're a lost cause anyways . 
  these lost-cause voters in france are hopefully a small segment , so germany clearly signaling its opinion is n't harmful . 
  in fact , it may actually help the voters that are intelligent enough to realize that france is n't an island . 
  also every single red-white-blue : [ dank u , nederland \\ ^ ^ ] ( https://i.redd.it/4czg0e70h4py.png ), 
  wait wait wait , what 's going on here !, 
  has / u/tvrtkoikraljsrbljem grown yet another ~ ~ alt ~ ~ split personality ? 
  or are you two fighting ? 
  article thinks :  it was a secret ballot , but the math tells us that at least 15 of the following democratic member states of the u.n. economic and social council voted to elect saudi arabia to the u.n.

  credit to / u/sn0r from the [ italian president 's plane escorted by eurofighter typhoon ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/627hly/italian_presidents_plane_escorted_by_eurofighter/ ) thread ~ ----------------- people who have n't seen a fighter jet escorting their airplane in person do n't know how incredibly spectacular it actually is . 
  you 're sitting in a big tube , flying serenely through the sky , looking out your window ( which in itself is incredible enough ) when suddenly these little wasps appear in the distance . 
  they swoop in with a speed you 've never thought possible to line up right on the wing of your aircraft . 
  and then you see the pilots in their tiny bubble canopies and you realise that those are real guys and they are strapped to millions of euros worth of fuel , jet engine technology and raw killing power that can take you out in the blink of an eye . 
  these young lads can fly across the entirety of europe in an hour or so and have ultimate command of the skies . 
  maybe they 'll wiggle their wings at you . 
  maybe they 'll wave . 
  and then they pull away again . . faster than a sparrow in flight . . up or out or down . . it does n't matter . 
  the agility and speed just silences you with its awesomeness . 
  it 's a sobering moment . 
  look , if usa and russia directly attack each other , especially if it 's with nukes , whole europe is going to be a radioactive wasteland 6 months later so this discussion is useless . 
  [ have n't shared this video in years :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcpjgl2bals ), 
  otherwise in translation  where all the turks ( go ) , little mujo follows it 's the equivalent of `` monkey see monkey do '' , i guess . 
  nah , that 's just kinggeorgecommands . 
  otherwise known as `` that brexit guy '' and `` that guy who bet le pen will win first round '' . 
  the terms of the bet were : he 'll wear the eu-flair for a week if he loses . 
  kept his word , so respect for that . 
   acceptable wines well i guess that if french call them `` acceptable '' , they 're actually very good . 
  nice to know :d, 
  but most slavs do n't have close cultural ties with russia ? 
  off the top of my head , you have belarus and serbia ... hell even montenegro is moving towards nato and eu ( despite russians investing some money into montenegro iirc ) . 
  afaik the rest of ex-yu is neutral at best , poland is n't arming itself for giggles , czech and slovaks still negatively remember what communism did , ukraine is at outright war , hell even romania and bulgaria do n't like them ( though it 's debatable how slav they are ) . 
  in fact , i 'd say that slavs in general are * more * hostile/distrustful of russia than other euros . 
  obviously they would be , being on the other side of the iron curtain sucked , period . 
  heh , even icty made that mistake . 
  i ca n't be the only one that thinks the accusations leveled at gotovina were a `` well the people we wanted to trial about all this are inconveniently dead , but why waste even more paper '' case . 
  ( and it 's dubious those accusations would have even stuck for tu\u0111man & co - i mean if they could n't make em stick for slobo ... ), 
  tbh i personally frown a lot on hiroshima & nagasaki . 
  i mean you can argue about that ending the war , `` what would have happened if you did n't '' , how it worked as a military action etc etc , but to me that was blasting two civilian cities to the ground ( 129,000 -- 226,000 + killed ) . 
  and yet so many decades later , the fact that it was a massive war-crime is somehow [ `` debatable '' . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/atomic_bombings_of_hiroshima_and_nagasaki#debate_over_bombings ), 
  bad snek how does one even step on it ? 
  yeah , we like you lot ... even when we should n't, 
  hmm .
