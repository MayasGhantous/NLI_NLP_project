  have any examples of an eurogay plane ? 
  it has to be * fabulous * , of course . 
  well , yes ? 
  and we 're grateful for the political support ( plus , the direction from which many of the weapons came from ) . 
  but the actual fighting , both in 91/92 and then 95 , was done by us . 
  my point is that while i was resentful as a kid in the 90 's - `` why is nobody helping us ? '', 
  - looking at it ( and the middle east ) in retrospect , i suspect it could have been worse . _ . 
  as for bosniaks , they were the worst-hit by the embargo , in large part because of geography . 
  so it 's no wonder they got the shortest end of the stick . 
  and that 's a case of un - outsiders - involvement making things worse . 
  well i already ranted about the weapons embargo , which created serious difficulties . 
  so the un just staying out of it in earlier stages would have been helpful . 
  as for general usa involvement ... 
  i do n't know . 
  on one hand , usa/nato showed that they can break up a fight with the later bombing of serbia ( regardless of whether it was the appropriate/just response , it did settle down kosovo ) . 
  on the other hand , whenever i look at what outsider 's involvement does/fails to do in the middle east ( ongoing clusterfuck since i can remember ) , i thank my lucky stars that croatia at least was ignored and left to `` handle it '' on our own . 
  nobody has any particular good or bad interests in us , safety through irrelevance , yay . 
  bruh , i have witnessed your comments and downboats , and while i 'll grant you 're anti-globalist/very right-wing/etc , you 're nowhere near as bad as the t_d spammers that occasionally try to invade this sub . 
  because i 've seen you * make some sense * , among other things :p, 
  begging pardons ; - ; it 's a meme i use as short-hand for `` it does n't matter at all which gender/sexual orientation/belief/etc etc you are '' . 
  how dare you  eastern europe ? 
  [ ohhh dear lord now you 've done it xd ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge4sxlgiaga ), 
   this is the general belief on the internet about the french . 
  usa-internet , maybe uk-internet . 
  the rest of us scratch just our heads , `` do n't these people remember napoleon ? '', 
  well , not psychic . 
  but you do n't need to be psychic to realize there are only two options on the table : peaceful dissolution of yugoslavia , or war ( to keep it together , or to simply annex different parts ) . 
  so in the case that peace talks break down , how does it even remotely help if only one side is armed ? 
  it does n't take a genius to predict what happens next ... 
  no ; - ; [ but at least we have kulen !, 
  ] ( http://www.tasteofadriatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kulen2.jpg ), 
  well ... while i generally agree with you - un does n't get enough credit for what it does right - in this specific case , the yugoslav wars of the 90 's , they were n't just useless . 
  they were * worse * than useless ( in my view ) . 
  i 'm specifically talking about the [ weapons embargo ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/yugoslav_wars#arms_embargo ) . 
  the tl ; dr of that bit of `` wisdom '' was : forbid the sale of weapons to yugoslavia ( obviously ) . 
  with an interesting plot twist , there was already a well-armed army within yuga , the yna , and yna turned into a default-serbian army . 
  so basically the other sides were caught with their pants down in ' 91 . 
  now we did manage to smuggle ( and steal from yna ) enough for some basic defense , but the un asking about the actual situation on the ground would take all of 5 minutes . 
  ( bosniak side had it hardest when it came to smuggling , no wonder they came off worst in that war . ), 
  that tells me that un was either too incompetent to tie its shoelaces ... or it had some very different ideas on what should happen in yugoslavia . 
  fwiw my first encounters with that meme were turk-based . 
  or generally ottoman/muslim based ... also popular whenever isil does isil things . 
  ( there 's also erdogoon barking at us , and then you get `` is it happening again ? '', 
  and then `` remove kebab time ? '' ), 
  it was only when i later randomly googled the origin of the meme that i learned it started with bosnia . 
  i think it may be because of what happened later/the general context . 
  in yugoslavia in wwii you had nazi invaders , native nazi collaborators ( ndh or `` usta\u0161e '' ) , and nazi/anti-fascist resistance ( `` partisans '' ) . 
  same partisans just so happened to be commies ( yeah , i know , pick between fascism and communism , we 're really the special olympics here ) , and they did win , but well ... it 's kind of like the soviet victims in wwii . 
  not as nearly as `` tragic '' to westerners . 
  fwiw , i think if you asked whatever random croat on the street , they 'd hardly know about the negative press . 
  mostly because following the press makes us go for the bottle , politburo took potato here , politicians playing yakety sax there ;d what 's in the general consciousness of random folks here : government does a commemoration at jasenovac every year . 
  some people appreciate that , others think it 's not enough , half an hour later it somehow ends up with * disibiodevesprve * , after which every sane person changes the channel . 
  but it 's not forgotten ? 
  i hear about jasenovac basically every other day ... any more remembering and i 'd be german . 
  as for those that chant `` za dom spremni '' , they 're not intelligent enough to understand that the saying has different meanings to different people . 
  i 've tried to draw it out to them , believe me ... think of them like \u0160e\u0161elj-supporters . 
  lost cause , but the `` silver lining '' is that the dumbest of them will die out in the next decade or so . 
  ... i hope you let him keep the boxers, 
  false notions of war : too many hollywood action movies and epic ballads . 
  then everyone acts so * surprised * when innocents get harmed , as if they did n't get harmed in literally every war since the beginning of time . 
  and this is n't specific to any one nation/culture . 
  i see people from all countries ( except maybe switzerland ) thinking positively about `` dealing with '' turkey/russia/middle east/insert place x that y does n't get along with . 
  but that 's the thing with un protection missions . 
  they 're largely useless , no ? 
  it 's not that the dutch should be blamed , it 's un getting involved saying `` we 've got this '' , when they do n't actually take care of anything . 
  then the sops who trusted that un will actually do * something * end up getting the short end of the stick . 
  i mean ... 
  i guess un is n't utterly useless when it comes to general aid-missions ? 
  health , medicine , etc. 
  but when it comes to breaking up conflicts , [ all they 're good for is writing `` sternly worded letters . 
  huh , any examples ? 
  ( also , yugoslavia was largely catholic/orthodox . 
  plus aggressively atheist by politics . ), 
  i used to think it does n't get any worse than trp ... then incels turned up . 
  goes to show that `` it can always get worse '' ( . _ . ), 
  it has quotas ? 
  it over here could n't care less , for heaven 's sake you do n't even need a college diploma , as long as you can code . 
  you may as well identify as an apache attack helicopter for all they care . 
  none of the colleges over here have any particular quotas either , you get in by grades and entrance exam , finish by grades the same . 
  ( or else some fields would n't be so dominated by one gender . ), 
  if we do better than some western euros - [ we do ] ( http://www.uis.unesco.org/_layouts/unesco/women-in-science/index.html#details!lang=en&amp;view=map&amp;region=40530&amp;country=hrv&amp;panel=fields ) - then it 's not because of laws . 
  but i started to reply to another comment of yours ~  while the dirtier and uncozy professions are with  99 % males and nobody dares to move a lip about these . 
  where are you from , if i may ask ? 
  because off the top of my head , here the worst - least paid - jobs are mostly taken by women . 
  shopkeeper/cashier and cleaning * lady * , and this is n't a small share of total population either . 
  the construction workers have it good in comparison ( i actually wish i could have worked as one after high school ) . 
  and nobody cares about that bit of inequality either . 
  that 's nonsense . 
  women are literally physically weaker , they ca n't do these jobs as well as men can , why would you even hire someone for equal pay if the same person ca n't do the job equally well ? 
  it is different . 
  there are no physical requirements there . 
  not necessarily , [ at least when it comes to science in general . 
  ] ( http://www.uis.unesco.org/_layouts/unesco/women-in-science/index.html#overview!lang=en&amp;view=map&amp;region=40530 ) also supported by [ this table . 
  ] ( http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?datasetcode=scn_ds&amp;lang=en# ) from what i can see in patterns : eastern block does better than west . 
  in our case , [ women are still worst represented in engineering & tech ] ( http://www.uis.unesco.org/_layouts/unesco/women-in-science/index.html#details!lang=en&amp;view=map&amp;region=40530&amp;country=hrv&amp;panel=fields ) ( yay for doctors !, 
  ) , but we still do better than for example [ netherlands . 
  ] ( http://www.uis.unesco.org/_layouts/unesco/women-in-science/index.html#details!lang=en&amp;view=map&amp;region=40500&amp;country=nld&amp;panel=fields ) ( it seems that for total-science representation among former-commies , czechia and hungary do worst . ), 
  \\  how dare you !, 
  & nbsp ; ( no but seriously now , marzipan seems to inspire ideological differences . 
  some ca n't stand it , some love it to bits . ),
