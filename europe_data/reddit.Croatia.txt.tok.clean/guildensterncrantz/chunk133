  i still do n't get it . 
  `` humiliating content criminalized '' ? 
  that 's ... 95 % of our journalists that should be criminally prosecuted but are n't . 
  literally all of my media `` humiliates '' something , usually the government . 
  apparently i do n't know the meaning of that word anymore . 
  it 's a government mouthpiece , parliament interfering with it is `` well , d'oh '' , they outright own it . 
  they ca n't / do n't do that with with networks they do n't own . 
  maybe i 've been living in a freedom-less state and i never noticed !, 
  shhhhh, 
  and since montenegro is the next in line to join up anyways ( at least when it comes to chapters opened/closed ) , albania is the next when you look at the coastal traffic corridor ( the missing link , slovenia -  croatia -  montenegro -  ? 
  -  greece ) . 
  and when it comes to money in terms of eu funds , none of these options would be net contributors ... only the difference is , turkey has nearly 80 million people , albania has 3 , bosnia has 3,5 . 
  turkey would likely be a larger drain , at least at the beginning . 
  and that 's before you look at [ issues .

  oi , what 's wrong with mozartkugeln ? 
  hold on are you trying to tell me 9/11 * was n't * an inside job ? 
  so did the croats in bosnia , and yet the croats in croatia are still responsible for funding them and helping them . 
  ( and this was proven for both sides . ), 
  for heaven 's sake both sides wanted to literally annex themselves to serbia/croatia at different points . 
  that 's a very lame `` shield of innocence '' , if you ask me . 
  huh , [ i think this is it . 
  ] ( https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/1994-12-01a.pdf ) large chunks are blanked out ... though various news-sites and books use it as source for the 90 % claim . 
  i suppose they got access to the more relevant bits ? 
  or the number is somewhere in that link , but i did n't notice ( honestly , i do n't feel like attentively reading this ) . 
  as for the opportunity , uhhh , ok ? 
  now i 'm getting rather too philosophical , but i do n't believe in the concept of a * clean * war . 
  you have these `` armchair generals judging after the battle is done '' , always acting so * surprised * that innocents were harmed in war x , as if innocents did n't get harmed in literally every war since the beginning of history . 
  if they 're so concerned , they should protest before a war starts , what do they expect ? 
  did they learn about war from airbrushed american tv or actual history ? 
  so no , i 'm not surprised that serbs had the biggest share of war-crimes in bosnia . 
  but that 's the thing about war ... the moment your tanks cross into somebody else 's land , you can expect it 'll get ugly fast . 
  in the case of yugoslavia 91-95 , the specific case was : none of the battles happened in serbia . 
  if it was different , if croatia sent tanks over danube into serbia , we 'd probably be having a different story today , but that 's a what-if . 
  all you can do after the dust settles is see who did what ( as far as can be proven , anyways ) . 
  have you read the link ? 
  it also states that this particular report was n't something the usa politicians wanted , because they were still hoping to work something out with slobo . 
  to the surprise of literally no-one , most outsiders did n't want yuga to break up , or just simply did n't give a toss ( look up un weapons embargo and which side it benefited ) . 
  as if you 'd need any cia - or outsiders , period - meddling to break up yuga , when yuga 's coffin was being hammered since before wwii . 
  ( brotherhood and unity , my ass . ), 
  but if you do n't agree with cia , how about [ human rights watch ? 
  ] ( https://www.hrw.org/report/2006/12/13/weighing-evidence/lessons-slobodan-milosevic-trial ) or the [ un general assembly in ' 92 ] ( http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/47/a47r121.htm ) report on the situation in bosnia ? 
  i found those within 5 minutes of skimming what wiki put into its sources . 
  or , how about : if you have any even remotely credible sources that go against that cia report ( beyond statistical error ) , share . 
  and i 'm not counting `` well , * everybody knows * '' , it seems that different sides `` know '' different things . 
  ( this is why i 'm not quoting any sources from ex-yu . ), 
  they use the metric system instead of freedom units ? 
  wait wait , is that the same thing as royale with cheese ? 
  and do those french really drown it in mayo ? 
  i agree that reports from none of the 3 sides can be really trusted , numbers have a nasty tendency to get inflated by as much as 300 % . 
  so ok ... [ does cia count as propaganda ? 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/09/world/cia-report-on-bosnia-blames-serbs-for-90-of-the-war-crimes.html ) it 's apparently the most supported report that can be found anywhere . 
  ( though certainly not the only report . 
  but all other outsider-reports i can recall go along a similar vein , only the specific percentages change somewhat . ), 
  do n't get me wrong , all 3 sides sucked in different measures , there were no saints in the 90 's . 
  but this false equivalence for the sake of , what ? 
  fairness ? 
  somebody 's feelings ? 
  politics ? 
  yea , it is n't helping bury the hatchet . 
  if they meet membership requests like everyone else , yes . 
  [ they never even tried .

  ''  ... [ why do n't you skip back to t_d , hmm ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/672fc9/live_live_coverage_of_the_french_presidential/dgntvmn/ ), 
  i 've long since grown tired of this bullshit . 
  turkey is n't closing its door ? 
  even thought its friendliness is this side of russia ? 
  does he think europe gets regularly struck by selective amnesia ? 
  as for `` waiting for 54 years '' ( except it 's actually 30 , can he literally not open his mouth without obvious lies pouring out ? 
  ) , * cry me a river * . 
  since its bid , turkey ... [ closed 1 out of 35 chapters . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/accession_of_turkey_to_the_european_union#table_of_chapters ) 1 !, 
  and those are the same chapters that everyone has to go through , without bawling to anyone who 'll listen about how `` unfair '' it is . 
  has nobody ever explained to him/them that you may as well wait * forever * if you refuse to actually cooperate ? 
  i hope the 251 passing though here got back home alright . 
  best korea ? 
  entschuldigung , i somehow skipped over the `` alone '' part . 
  and yeah , i agree with you , everyone here should chip in . 
  definitely not stable , especially if eu/the western alliance falls apart . 
  but world war ca n't involve the main powers fighting head on , because they can always threaten each other with nukes . 
  proxy wars in the middle east is where the pissing contests are atm . 
  besides , the powers that be realized some decades ago that they can get rich much faster and better by capitalism/white-collar robbery/call it what you want , than by conventional stealing of clay and resources . 
  they lack motivation for too much direct war . 
  nato is a mostly usa-thing . 
  so europe mostly depends on usa 's goodwill ... regardless of whether that 's a good idea or not . 
  i do n't think many people here are interested in growing the euro armies to the point they 're playing the world police role , but at least being able to defend ourselves in case of an invasion is surely a pragmatic thing ? 
  no abdul here . 
  none of me worrying about armed `` normals '' snapping and going on a rampage , either , though those are called `` mentally ill '' instead of `` terrorist '' , * because that makes me so much safer * . 
  i 'll pass , thank you very much . 
  yeah , i can see that from the thread . 
  it 's just surprising . 
  i vaguely remembered that they have less restrictive gun control than most of europe , but did n't know they take it so personally . 
  i mean i 'm used to usa which has guns somewhere in the bill of rights and is n't shy about letting the whole internet know ... this is me meeting a very big point of difference-in-thinking within europe . 
  oi you leave my \u0161nicle alone !, 
  ... actually nevermind more for me !, 
  lost the bet , kept the promise / r/madlads, 
  ok ... but i still do n't understand why anyone would be pro-gun . 
  if it 's recreational , like hunting , you have licenses for that . 
  if it 's protection ... uhh , you 're not going to walk around downtown with your pet kala\u0161njikov , or at least hopefully that wo n't happen without getting you committed .
