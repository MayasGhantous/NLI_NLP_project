  so the argument that guns help against terrorism is thin at best ( personally , i do n't want * anyone * walking around with a semi , a small gun , hell even a knife , because you never know when they might * snap * ) . 
  and unless you 're toting a bazooka , you wo n't be helped against the more recently fashionable truck-attacks . 
  not sure why it 's a big deal anyways ? 
  the arguments against this measure sound like those that usa has , so that 's not helping either . 
  why would anyone insist on having a semi ? 
  uhh , tradition ? 
  protection ? 
  it 's so important that they 'd rather leave schengen/eea , which i just ca n't compute . 
  can anyone enlighten me ? 
  yeah i 'm not sure what op is going on about ( it was probably worse immediately after brexit , but that 's understandable ) . 
  the most i 've seen in the last 2 months i 've been here is the occasional uk-hater ( french are the most common in my experience ) , plus people being salty/throwing shade at brexit itself , but not uk as a whole . 
  ( i throw shade at brexit because i think it 's a bad decision that 'll hurt us all . 
  i 'm doing the same with french that want to break eu . ), 
  also , if op thinks that brits have it bad ... try being from balkan/usa/russia / turkey ( . _ . ), 
  \\  nonsense , i 'm `` controversial '' atm , such edge much wow \\  also , if you want to have the arrows without quote-formatting , put \\ before  \\  like this, 
  oh yeah , hundertwasser is to me one of the more interesting ... 
  architects around . 
  but then again , i 'm a fan of gaudi/dali/etc , so idk how objective my opinions are  i liked that part of vienna especially because my impression ^ ^ 1 of that city is that it 's very beautiful , and probably a good place to live , but also somehow ... cold ? 
  too orderly , perhaps ? 
  [ example . 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b3/ef/6d/b3ef6d657e1eb16bcbe15e64161a3eef.jpg ) [ another example . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/schloss_sch%c3%b6nbrunn_wien_2014_%28zuschnitt_2%29.jpg/1200px-schloss_sch%c3%b6nbrunn_wien_2014_%28zuschnitt_2%29.jpg ) so this was a nice quirky-break from the typical central-europe architecture . 
  [ 1 ] i spent less than a day there , on the way back from prague . 
  it 's like ... like getting a tasty sandwich and only being allowed to take one bite . 
  better than getting no bite at all , but still :o, 
  as i said , it 's not racism because it 's not about outdated concepts of race . 
  so instead of talking shit about skin color , you talk shit about religion , and with the same attitude . 
  i could edit the old racist arguments about `` those blacks are inherently lesser people , hordes are coming , hide yo children '' with `` those muslims are inherently lesser people , hordes are coming , hide yo children '' . 
  so , correction : `` i 'm not judgemental , but ... '' adapted . 
  exactly , they are n't , and this is why the kind of shit that would never fly against africans or asians is a-ok against muslims . 
  racism got smart and * adapted * . 
  are you talking marcon or le pen ? 
  \\  insert freeze peach \\  insert slippery slope fallacy \\  bonus karma orwellquote.jpg, 
  why is it beside the point ? 
  i got used to internet nonsense a long time ago . 
  / pol / , t_d , whatever , they 're hive-minds , and i assumed that it 's just inexperienced brats that do n't reflect the population at large at all . 
  2016 taught me otherwise , nowadays i take what such circlejerks are ranting about with 30 % salt , instead of 70 % as i used to . 
  one of donald 's main proposals was `` deporting the bad hombres '' , `` building a wall and making mexico pay for it '' , and let 's not forget america first . 
  acting like there are n't at least undertones of racism and/or exceptionalism there is also counter-productive . 
   people in post-industrial areas with sky-high unemployment and no prospects voting for le pen are n't dumb idiots voting against their interests . 
  alright , the people that fell into the cracks are n't being addressed properly . 
  but let 's not pretend that the likes of trump/le pen/nigel farage are n't populists offering lame solutions , same solutions that 'll only screw over same unemployed people . 
  on the example of le pen and her `` wise '' plan to destroy the eu , that sort of thing will lessen trade and therefore employment . 
  so they are voting against their own interests . 
  as far as i 'm aware the politicians are alright ? 
  as someone said elsewhere , you 're one of the most important countries for us when it comes to trade , banks , investments , tourism , even our gastarbajters ( not as many as in germany , but still ) etc etc. 
  so politics mostly reflect that , but we 're not resentful about how important you are . 
  and if you asked the zeitgeist in 1918 , it 'd go like `` fuck this ship , i 'm leaving '' , but a lot of time and * worse * unions passed since then ;d so the people are neutral at worst , and that 's mostly because we do n't skype with you as much as we do with germany . 
  ca n't speak for slovakia , but a-h were mostly alright as far as empires go , at least for us . 
  yes , there were ugly times like the attempted magyarization . 
  and the periphery goes neglected , as is the case in many empires/even modern countries . 
  but on the other hand , we united with them peacefully , though politicking , instead of war-anschluss , which by default makes them better than 95 % of the usual empires . 
  and it was - debatably - helpful to be with them during the ottoman invasions . 
  it 's debatable because a ) it 's not like they were helping the military frontier out of the goodness of their hearts , better to have aggressive invaders on the periphery than in your capital , and b ) ottomans got tired out by the time they came to us . 
  but i 'm still convinced it helped , look at what happened with the rest of independent balkan countries trying to stand up to ottomans . 
  plus , the areas where they ruled are still generally more prosperous today than the ones under that were under ottomans and even arguably venice . 
  the problem with australia , well the first is different geography . 
  they 're much more isolated than italy , or god forbid greece ( and their islands ) . 
  but the christmas island-type solution was proposed anyways ... problem is , we have no such convenient islands , or even agreements with them . 
  iirc they were trying to negotiate something with tunisia , renting some bit of their clay/their small island ( ? 
  ) , in return for payments etc etc. 
  tunisia wo n't agree to it . 
  the rest of mediterranean africa is even more of a lost cause . 
  mind you , maybe they manage to work something out in the end ... 
  i hope they do . 
  because the first problem we have is our impossible-to-guard borders , and basically rounding them up for processing and then possible deportation . 
  and i do agree with you on careful integration ( two speed seems the best gentle compromise at the moment ) . 
  i just feel like these nationalists wo n't even give eu a chance to take it careful/fair , cause they want miracle solutions now . 
  [ \u253b \u2501 \u253b \u30fd ( ` \u0414 \u00b4 ) \uff89 \u253b \u2501 \u253b ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stjepan_radi%c4%87#assassination_in_parliament ), 
   he advocated granting greater autonomy to ethnic groups within the empire and addressing their grievances , especially the czechs in bohemia and the south slavic peoples in croatia and bosnia , who had been left out of the austro-hungarian compromise of 1867 . 
  youuuuuuuu ... !, 
  \\* shakes fist *, 
   regarding the '' migration strawman '' , why do you think people are voting for nationalist parties that are anti-eu ? 
  i do n't know if it 's a strawman , but it does n't make sense . 
  facts : europe is a good place to live . 
  most of our closest neighbors in africa and middle east ... not so much . 
  until europe becomes as much of a shithole as libya , migration from libya will not stop . 
  ( or libya gets better , along the lines of mexico-usa at least , but even there you have illegals . ), 
  facts : greece , balkans , italy , etc - they ca n't handle that sort of wave , short of literally shooting them at border or sinking their boats . 
  australian solution is n't working out here ( for various reasons ) . 
  facts : if we break the eu , the border countries will have to handle the wave all on their own , they wo n't be able to do that ( or they wo n't bother , why stop them if they 're trying to get to germany/france/sweden ) , only this time there wo n't be an eu to distribute the load , or help with borders , or try to force * any * kind of cooperation . 
  meanwhile , everybody will get poorer because of lost trade , border countries are easier pickings for `` good friends '' like erdogan and putin , and/or whole of europe is again a yes-man to usa/russia/coming up soon - china . 
  so that 's like getting an arm cut off ... which you `` solve '' by cutting off the other arm and shooting yourself in the head . 
  i 'll be all ears when someone proposes a solution that * makes sense . 
  huh , why ashamed ? 
  are n't you one of those * adult * countries of europe ? 
  various nationalists will tell you that all our various unions sucked , croatia stronk and independent , bla bla , however ~ even they will admit that [ maria theresa ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maria_theresa ) was cool cause * she got things done * . 
  + side-note to that , my dad says [ these trees ] ( http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/61909786.jpg ) in my suburb were planted by a-h . 
  thanks ? 
  + most interesting part of vienna i saw in my too-brief visit was [ hundertwasserhaus . 
  ] ( https://www.wien.info/media/images/hundertwasserhaus-19to1.jpeg ) + haydn , mozart , j. strauss , vienna secession ( thanks , i like it !, 
  ) , ... conchita wurst . 
  well , at least s/he has [ style . 
  ] ( http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/port/860/c/conchita-wurst-84fa3abd5a549ed008c23dad01fe5271dbb293a1.jpg ) + sometimes they get triggered if you call them `` little germany '' . 
  + some of them also occasionally say `` gib back coast \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064 '' + i actually went as `` that girl from sound of music '' on a musicals-theme-party . 
  but sound of music is n't a big thing in austria itself ? 
  * on that note , from [ tourist stereotypes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3amdy3/croatian_stereotypes_about_european_tourists/ ) : `` an austrian , just like a slovene , either comes on a bike or with a car with at least 6 bikes on the roof . 
  he does n't go to the beach but you 'll find him riding his bike in the middle of the mountain track . 
  you 're driving a golf 3 tdi and have a dead race to the top . 
  you try to push him off the track but he lifts the bike and drives on the back wheel while you end up hitting a rock .
