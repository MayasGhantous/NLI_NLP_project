  he comes to the top first and the half litre bottle of water he brought still has 4 decilitres left . 
  he gives it to you because the fan in your car is broken . '', 
  you 're right , they believe that ( as far as i can tell ) . 
  so i 'm actually wasting my time in this thread , getting upset in vain . 
  if they ca n't see how a return to the cold war politics ( or worse ) will be bad for europe , i 'm talking to a wall . 
  all i can hope is that most of the voters are n't that ... careless . 
  as i see it , there are two options : + the eu leaders ( who just so happen to be one and the same as the country leaders we all elected ) are absolutely retarded , and they ca n't see the way the wind is blowing with economic issues and rising nationalism that 's trying to destroy the eu much , much faster than said economic issues . 
  + the same eu leaders can see all that , because it 's logical that they 're equally or more intelligent than me , my grandma , and my dog . 
  ( literally everyone can see the problems . ), 
  they 'll do * something * about it . 
  like the two speed europe , which is basically the only possible compromise at the time . 
  in any case , economic problems destroying the eu is a * maybe * . 
  marine le pen destroying the eu is a * definite * . 
  we wo n't even be discussing the eu problems if she kicks france out of eu , because eu wo n't even exist . 
  it 's the equivalent of getting your arm hacked off ... and then you `` solve '' that by shooting yourself in the head . 
  and yes i feel that the comparisons are apt , because my country has been in different unions since 1102 ( ! ) . 
  the current eu problems are * small * in comparison to possible problems such unions can have ( did have !, 
  ) , and they 're definitely tiny in comparison to `` every country for itself '' . 
  for example , europe has a lot of illegal immigration . 
  but those immigrants wo n't stop trying to get into europe ... up until europe becomes a total shithole , like their own countries . 
  so they 'll keep trying , only the border countries will be dealing with that alone , after the eu is broken apart . 
   but in the long one perhaps it 's better for a disaster like trump to happen to initiate the change . 
  if the same kind of reasoning is used in the french elections , marine le pen will win , break the eu , and there will be no fixing that . 
  it will be a change , however . 
  and it wo n't impact france the worst . 
  has n't he mentioned more guards at the borders , more stringent integration of those already there , more deportation of illegals ? 
  that 's half of le pen 's schtick . 
  as for the rest , like the euro crisis , the uneven levels of cooperation between member states etc etc , that 's not up to him alone . 
  that 's up to the european * union * , which is apparently going forward with the two speed plan . 
  tbh that 's the best that can be done when you have some countries constantly dragging their feet , others wanting more integration , and you 're trying not to strong-arm anyone into anything . 
  so , the willing will be able to pick and choose . 
  he sounds like a proponent of that , and on the side of having france integrate and cooperate further . 
  but even if he 's literally only status-quo ( which i seriously doubt , as if the various eu politicians are deaf to the way the nationalistic wind is blowing ) , i 'll take that over a woman who 's trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater . 
  ok , fair enough . 
  i did n't go into details of marcon 's platform and how it relates to various countries , all i know is that his proposals are rather mixed : pro-neoliberal ( ? 
  ) , pro-integration-of-immigrants , pro-better-borders , pro-eu . 
  this last bit is what matters the most , by far . 
  i understand that france has troubles it wants to solve . 
  but i also understand that politicians come and go , platforms come and go , crises come and go , but if france wrecks the eu * now * , that is n't something that 'll `` come and go '' . 
  it 'll be just gone , and by the time europeans come to the bright idea to unite again because united we 're stronger ( to the surprise of nobody that can * count * ) , i might be trying to handle * one billion africans * storming into europe because africa is drying under global warming out as we speak - only i 'll be handling that alone because it 's every country for itself . 
  or bosnia may fly to pieces , turkey goes full retard , vlad rescues the oppressed russian minorities in the baltics , etc etc. 
  i feel that everybody who votes for candidates that are anti-eu ( whether openly or david cameron-style ) is either naive about all that , or worse - just simply does n't give a fuck . 
   do n't beg for left-wing votes you do n't need or blame them for the shit situation you put us in . 
  i have n't put anyone into anything . 
  my country is n't the one that 's threatening to break the eu into little pieces with a candidate that likes to pose with putin , a known `` good friend '' of the eu and his closest neighbors . 
  so my patience for distinct policies in 5-6 french candidates is rather thin , when i can easily see another * war * , or a remix of the cold war ( and i 'm not kidding about this ) , starting in europe within 10 years of eu flying to pieces . 
  since le pen 's attempts to break the eu make her more of my enemy than anything erdogan can do on his own , and since i literally ca n't do anything against her 2 weeks from now , all i can do is talk to you , * because you can vote against her * . 
   macron is right-wing . 
  then why is every government , pollster , and media group calling him a centrist ? 
   as for the trump/sanders allusions , i 'm afraid you 're the one not making sense . 
  you said you wo n't vote against le pen because your candidate is out . 
  this is what bernie bros did , abstained from voting for hillary , which gave them trump , who 's even worse . 
  trump allusions - you went on about how you were insulted as a left-winger . 
  trump supporters loved going on and on about how everyone insulted them too , so their vote was partially a protest vote , too . 
  ( or in your case , a protest non-vote . ), 
  i 'm trying to parse through what you said ... ok , le pen is right-wing . 
  extreme right-wing in some stuff , almost leaning left in some other stuff ( or at least , she * says * she 's adopted some of the left-ist concern for the workers ) . 
  put it all together , she 's right-wing . 
  right-wing votes for right-wing , left-wing votes for left-wing , both vote against the opposite , or for the center , if their favorite candidate is n't in the running . 
  yet you , a left-winger , wo n't vote for a centrist or * against * a right-winger because ... * you expect the right-wing to vote against itself ? 
  * what kind of sense does that even make ?? 
  also . 
   you ca n't insult and libel and make the left-wing worse than le pen all election long then ask for their vote against her . 
  i heard the exact same arguments from trumpeters , `` how dare you call us x you 'll be sorry you did that , here 's my protest vote !, 
  for x ! '', 
  and ,  no need to guilt trip left-wing people that do n't want to vote for him . 
  that was the bernie bots . 
  unless i seriously misunderstood you - in which case , i apologize - it 's amazing that both of those attitudes somehow united in one voter . 
  it does n't apply to us . 
  as i said , our kuna has been following euro - and dm before that - almost religiously , since its implementation . 
  all we actually lose is the * name * , while we gain easier tourism . 
  edit : and most of our large borrowing is in foreign currencies anyways , euro or usd most often . 
  but have n't most people been calling it a variation of czech-something for a long time now ? 
  and then , other people ca n't help but imagine `` bohemians '' , [ the hipsters of 19th century , ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/df/36/21/df3621440d79cc9c84a1b1b2ff784771.jpg ) whenever someone says `` bohemia '' ... or hear freddy mercury 's dulcet tones \u266a \u266b, 
  [ well we actually reduced debt ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/croatia/government-debt-to-gdp/forecast ) last year . 
  or our gdp grew , more likely . 
  [ they 're aiming for 75 % by 2019 ] ( http://www.reuters.com/article/croatia-debt-idusl5n1fg2oe ) through financial gimmicks that may as well be in chinese to me ( if some economist has things to say about that plan , i 'll be grateful ) . 
  [ the deficit has good news apparently , ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/business/18433-croatia-s-deficit-lowest-since-2002 ) for what it 's worth . 
  so hopefully something will actually happen with all that . 
  * mind you , debt is n't the end-all of economy . 
  look at uk for example ... [ or usa . 
  ] ( http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-debt-to-gdp ) i 'd rather our loons cut through at least some of the red tape and encourage the creation of new jobs/recovery of actual industry ( `` zimmer frei republik ! '' ), 
  first . 
  that makes a lot of sense , and thank you for explaining  that is , as someone who was a child in the 90 's , i find it kinda hard to relate to people being mostly content to live in less-free states . 
  on the other hand , i know that democracy by itself is n't an end-all goal of progress ( first you have to ensure you have legit candidates to vote for ... still working on that here . _ . 
  ) , and i can sort of understand how people can be alright with whatever system as long as it ensures they live fairly well , i heard plenty of that from older people around me . 
  so on a whole you 're a fascinating country to me , one of the very few examples of * adaptable * communism that can keep up with modern times . 
  and i really hope that if - or as you say , * when * - you transit to democracy , it 's gradual and sane . 
  at least you can look at us former commies and see where the worst pitfalls are :d, 
  and fillon 's voters apparently have a memory that resets every 2 weeks ? 
  she 'll stop saying things that are juuuust this side of `` sharia law ate my baby '' , which is half of her platform ? 
  she 'll stop trying to break the eu while posing with putin ? 
  ohhh dear lord i hope nobody is dumb enough to fall for that ; - ;, 
  serious question : how would implementing democracy on a country the size of china even work ? 
  i mean ... she said it right , they 're continent-sized . 
  the next biggest `` countries '' that are democratic are india and eu , india has many issues and not even remotely the same industrial output as china , while eu is a much , much looser organization . 
  do n't get me wrong , i 'm all for freedom , but something so gigantic having many voices who 'll probably want very different things , is n't it just likely china would fall apart into break-away regions and/or internal chaos ? 
  especially if the transition is as sudden as the rest of us former-commies had ... though i 'm not sure how one can even go from dictatorship to democracy in an `` orderly fashion '' . 
  yes , and it 's all actually a part of a complex hidden in [ one of tito 's submarine bases ] ( https://www.hvarboats.com/img/place/big/17e61-vis_submarine_tunnel.jpg ) no but seriously now , / u/silkkiuikku , apparently it comes from different plays of sunlight ( if that 's the english phrase for it ? ) . 
  openings in the ceiling and the sides , and then `` at this time of day the sunlight reflects through the water coming from the white floor of the cave and bathes the grotto in aquamarine light , while objects in the water appear to be silver . '',
