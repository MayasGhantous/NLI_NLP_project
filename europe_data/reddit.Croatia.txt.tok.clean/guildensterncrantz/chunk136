  be quiet now . 
  do we have to embarrass ourselves in literally every balkan thread ? 
  ok you lot seem to be missing some signals here . 
  / u/zetzet , you were trying to point at the fact that eu ascension takes time ? 
  or that newest future members will need to adopt euro immediately ? 
  while / u/eurovisionist7 got confused cause serbia has little to do with us ... so he thought * you * think we 're serbia or something ( our flag 's coat of arms resembles a pineapple , or so the dutch say ) ... so then he called you `` ethiopia '' as a dig ... because estonia ... but you 're not estonia , you 're lithuania -------- aaaah , i 'm lost !, 
  [ sentimental attachment i guess . 
  ] ( http://www.onlineforex.net/wp-content/uploads/croatian-kuna-coins.jpg ) and i can appreciate what the euro-bridges mean , but they 're just so ... [ bland in comparison . 
  ] ( http://www.atsnotes.com/catalog/banknotes-pictures/croatia/croatia-28.jpg ) also , i can tell unsuspecting strangers that `` we trade in martens ! '', 
  soooooo ... 
  i wonder when they 'll let us into euro . 
  i mean personally i 'd rather keep our kuna , whenever i go outside i ca n't adjust at thinking in `` 7-and-some * more * '' so i overspend , but tourism etc would like euro . 
  not that i blame the elder eu for being wary of us , stuff just mysteriously tends to not-function here , but if there are any exceptions , then it 's finance . 
  we 've been mostly stable in deficit/pay denbts/currency for a while now ... and we mostly follow the euro-trends anyways ( so no loss of `` independence '' on our side ) , before that it was the deutsche mark . 
  bad bureaucracy is the tl ; dr. [ i copied the most relevant factors here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61gczr/ease_of_doing_business_in_2017_country_global/dfe9apu/ ) and there was the usual discussion in that thread , why we think any particular country does well/or not on that measurement . 
  ( that was the day i learned belgium has way too many taxes . ), 
  off the top of my head , it may be a side-effect of their mafia ? 
  you can have your opinion on whatever facts , so long as you do n't * act * on those opinions that happen to be ignorant or harmful . 
  for example , anti-vaxxers . 
  they 're so convinced in the `` sanctity of opinions '' that they 're using the freedom-argument to defend their willful ignorance ... which just so happens to be harming not only their own children ( child abuse !, 
  ) , but also everyone else . 
  look up [ herd immunity ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herd_immunity ) , for example :  measles was considered eliminated in the united states in 2000 . 
  but if the first month of 2015 is any indication , this year will easily beat the record number of measles cases recorded in 2014 . 
   the narrative during this outbreak , or any measles outbreak really , is that measles is a highly transmissible disease . 
  ** so transmissible in fact that 90-95 % of people must be vaccinated in order to protect the entire population , or achieve what is called herd immunity . 
  do n't be ridiculous , mosques look perfectly nice . 
  [ islamic architecture in general ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=islamic+architecture&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahukewjwh-scxl3tahwsl8akhewicpgq_auibigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818 ) is very beautiful ( at least to my eyes , though i suppose it may also be because i 'm bored with all the typically west/central europe architecture here ) . 
  also , what / u/leagueoflucian said . 
  but which countries are `` cool '' to hate ? 
  tbh russia got stale decades ago ... usa is wearing thin lately , too . 
  ( though president twitterbot did his best . ), 
  is turkey in again ? 
  we did n't hate them much for the past 100 years ... 
  well those coastal folks not only use strange words i do n't understand , but they also seem to have only two settings : `` not a single fuck was given that day '' and [ excessively hyped-up . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/azzmgph.png ) and i blame * you * , just so you know !, 
  ninja edit : happy cake-day !, 
  well they stayed away ... on their island . 
  oh bloody hell . 
  how do you imagine the eu is supposed to work out if members can do whatever they want ? 
  there 's a saying here , translates to something like `` 100 midwives , sluggish baby '' . 
  eu has a lack of a clear vision and implementation of decisions , not the excess . 
  half-measures like having the same currency without having the same economic policy do n't work at all . 
  but on the other hand , you have these members that perpetually drag their feet on this or that part of the policy , with a single veto grinding everything to a halt . 
  so , `` several speed europe '' . 
  those that want to integrate further on trade/currency/army / environment protection/etc etc can go ahead , those that do n't want it will be simply left aside , their choice . 
  and not just him , from what i can sense of the other eu officials , they 're all uneasy . 
  first brexit , then trump , then erdogoon threatening us every other tuesday , and now this rising populism across europe - it 's not drastic yet , but everyone and their grandmother can see how the wind is blowing . 
  they 'll * have to * do something . 
  ] ( http://croatia.eu/images/01-01/kravata.jpg ) apparently visiting romanians like to take selfies with the signs ;d, 
  huh , i almost said that they were the first to recognize us , but  ukraine and latvia were the first to react by recognizing croatian independence in the second week of december . 
  the following week , iceland and germany recognized it , on 19 december 1991 , as the first western european countries to do so . 
  ehh , close enough ? 
   or how about ease of doing business , where france is near the bottom of europe ? 
  [ it literally is n't . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ease_of_doing_business_index ) i even made a map that points out [ the differences within europe ] ( https://i.imgur.com/bu6ylqj.png ) better . 
  ( and since that map hardly corresponds to hdi/gdp/ppp , it 's not the most relevant measure . ), 
   or iq , which has been dropping for decades due to mass migration from low iq regions in the world . 
  ahhh . 
  i looked at the sources for that study . 
  a lot of `` lynn '' - this [ lynn , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iq_and_the_wealth_of_nations ) i assume . 
  that disgusting study is not only blatantly racist , after all plenty of things are racist , but it 's utterly * stupid * . 
  according to lynn and vanhanen , [ whole swathes of africa ] ( https://iq-research.info/en/page/average-iq-by-country ) are supposed to be drooling all over the place ( you know that iq below 70 is not only very [ rare ] ( https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a5fb218eb8d8419ba58d9f0b1daa2bfd ) , it 's at that point when people may call you medically retarded ? ), 
  excuse me if i 'm not wasting time on any study that quotes lynn a lot ( and that 's just lynn that i 'm aware of , never checked the others , but i would n't be surprised if they had a similar `` methodology '' ) . 
   the entire french system is rotten to the core and france 's voting cattle just keeps voting for more of the same . 
  because all the frenchmen who actually desired just and efficient governance are dead and their children are lazy , spineless cowards . 
  ohhh , you brave redditor of 13 minutes , i 'm done with you . 
  res-tagged . 
   but france has been in the gutters for a while now  france in the gutters  france  '' ... '' [ hdi map 2016 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/2016_un_human_development_report.svg/921px-2016_un_human_development_report.svg.png ) [ nominal gdp per capita 2015 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/gdp_per_capita_%28nominal%29_2015.png ) [ ppp per capita in 2015 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita_in_2015.svg/863px-countries_by_gdp_%28ppp%29_per_capita_in_2015.svg.png ) [ global peace index 2016 ] ( http://www.dw.com/image/19313416_401.png ) i know that this sub has some seriously skewed `` first world problems '' perspective . 
  but if not advancing as fast as * germany * makes you `` in the gutters '' , i do n't even know what to say . 
  the world is then split into the 1 % good and 99 % bad ? 
   express does n't agree with my views and spins real stories so hard they leave the realm of reality does n't mean thy have no right to report it . 
  but that 's not journalism or reporting . 
  if it has about as much truth in it as my grandma 's nonsense ramblings , at the very best it 's nonsense , at worst it 's lying propaganda . 
  you can not lie and then defend your lies with `` everybody has the right to speak '' , as if accidental or deliberate ( more often deliberate ) false speech is somehow as equally valuable as the truth . 
  if you 're in the business of reporting * facts * instead of `` opinions '' , then you ought to be held to the standard of reporting goddamn facts . 
  it 's like ... it 's like bleeding to death , and demanding a surgeon , and you do n't get a surgeon but a believer in `` alternate medicine '' , but that 's a-ok because `` freedom '' . 
  what ? 
  `` hon hon hon '' ^ ^ & nbsp ; france , & nbsp ; 2017, 
  so we have a dick city and a dream island . 
  anything else ? 
  a wet dream village perhaps ? 
  depends on what you look at . 
  a single parliament making all the important decisions , like my country 's parliament does ? 
  no way , europe is far too large and diverse for that . 
  croatia has had almost 900 years of experience with a centralized government in multi-country unions , periphery is usually neglected in such cases , and do n't let me even get started on fair representation ( tyranny of majority is what happens more than it should ) . 
  mind you the eu parliament/etc are far too powerless as they are right now . 
  some middle ground between what they are atm , and national governments - would work out best , i think . 
  common language ? 
  we 're already talking in english here . 
  common culture ? 
  again , we already share a lot of culture , though i 'd argue that it 's usually imported from usa ( and even uk ) , not much cross-over between non-english speaking countries . 
  common defense ? 
  i 'd rather sign up for that than nato , which is a mostly-usa organization . 
  common currency is n't working out without a common fiscal policy , so something has to give there . 
  free movement within borders is alright , though again i wish that the periphery did n't take the shorter end of the stick . 
  tl ; dr : more unity than what we have today would be welcome , even necessary , but eu ca n't become usa . 
  i do n't think it even should .
