   europe without the eu is the us . 
  less than usa , because usa is still a superpower , as far as these definitions go . 
  they have a lot of people , a big army , many internal resources , big gdp and ppp , they neighbor mexico , canada , and two oceans . 
  we neighbor turkey , the middle east , russia and african `` countries '' such as libya . 
  and all that talk about germany , uk , france and italy being in the top 10 gdp 's means almost nothing because the real picture looks like [ this . 
  ] ( http://statisticstimes.com/economy/image/world/gdp-nominal-ranking.jpg ) usa - and even china - can squish these 4 any time they want . 
  ( and that 's just those 4 , the rest of us might as well be little bugs in terms of muscle . ), 
  meanwhile , the picture is [ much different ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/world_share_of_nominal_gdp_imf_weo_2015.png/1024px-world_share_of_nominal_gdp_imf_weo_2015.png ) when you put the eu together . 
  i understand why people are concerned with the issues eu is facing , both internally and externally , but i ca n't understand how anyone can think these small euro countries can stand * on their own * in today 's world . 
  to me , it 's `` pick the least bad '' : obeying russia , usa , china , or eu ? 
  politics supported by scientists is the way to go . 
  scientists alone would n't be able to come to a consensus quick enough , for example if you asked an economist and an ecologist about what to do about power plants , they 'd likely have very different answers ( at least for some small time-frame ) . 
  politicians then find some compromise that can satisfy both sides enough . 
  ( unless they 're beholden to big business , then global warming turns out to be a `` chinese hoax '' . 
  but that 's bad science anyways , so moot point . ), 
  communists hoping for a fascist coup ... ohhhh . 
  a tiny part of me hopes they get to see how communists are treated by fascists , if only for the schadenfreude-popcorn value . 
  ( the rest of me is horrified by the ignorance and the potential fallout . ), 
  outside of very small/local groups of people voting for very simple/direct decisions , direct democracies are nonsense . 
  most people are n't informed enough about most political issues , because that 's not their job in the first place . 
  imo politics may as well be as complicated as surgery , and you do n't expect the non-surgeons to know * enough * to decide about that . 
  the difference is that politics affects us more , and the issues can be `` kind of '' parsed down to a few simple-ish platforms ( a promised vague x , b promised vague y ) that you vote for . 
  the real direct decisions are then taken by these experts that are - presumably - more informed and wise than you are . 
  is n't it the infamous 200 families owning almost everything ? 
  or at least that 's the story i heard . 
  much better than 22 people for 40 % , but ... still no good . 
  first time i 'm seeing that sub . 
  ... i have so many questions . 
  this is better than any walk of shame through srd or karmacourt \\* . 
  on that note , how do r/europe mods treat cases of bamboozlement ? 
  yes ... but that does n't explain t_d . 
  the 2nd link in my comment , they 're literally saying that `` either way , trump wins '' . 
  and by either way , they mean that either le pen wins , or france turns into a rape-istan , so then trump can point at france as an example of what not to do . 
  so they 're actually saying `` it 's all * good * for us '' . 
  ahhh , well \\* shifts uncomfortably * i did n't !, 
  i know i know , i suck , my username is literally them , and i 've been saying i 'll read/watch it for * years * . 
  people just awkwardly stare at me in wonder when i say i have n't yet . 
  [ shame ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/a0/70/c2/a070c2c611e45a47568cf903d4620a71.jpg ), 
   how is that subreddit not quarantined ? 
  as far as i remember , the working theory of the dramanauts of srd is : politics . 
  they 're far too big , and far too endorsed by mr. president ( for heaven 's sake his ama was there instead of at / r/iama ) . 
  can you imagine the media shitstorm if admins did anything more harsh than just stopping them from spamming r/all ? 
  i know that feel ; _ ; and thanks !, 
  my highschool self was very impressed by the end of hamlet , what with the `` ps . 
  oh yeah , just in case you were wondering , side goons 1 & 2 are also kill ! '', 
  i concluded that shakespeare was actually a very intelligent troll , so ~ \u2661, 
  i have two vague working theories : + they come from some seriously unfortunate backgrounds , so cheering at someone else 's suffering is normal to them ; + they never experienced true loss/pain/fear in their spoiled , bratty little lives . 
  my experience had a lot of absolutely snotty brats talking about violence/war when they know * jack shit * about both . 
  armchair generals taken to the extreme , basically . 
  / u/derdiedas812 / u/francepourquoijv [ maybe here ? 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/6732gh/live_french_election_results_and_discussion_thread/dgnqbka/ ) i seriously do n't want to browse that sub further ( . _ . ), 
  edit : [ ok better one ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/6732gh/live_french_election_results_and_discussion_thread/dgnpxxa/ ) and i 'm done !, 
  pay no mind to kinggeorge , he 's been deliberately bleeding karma all over the thread . 
  ca n't rightly tell you what he means to accomplish \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  is n't their voting sort of similar to our eu parliament ? 
  as in , for the parliament the representation is skewed towards smaller countries , but that 's set in place because otherwise most of the eu would get drowned out by the 3-4 biggest states . 
  usa sort of started in the same way , an union of states that were promised a fair-ish representation ( regardless of most people living on the two shores ) . 
  spoiler tag that shit ; _ ;, 
  right , but is n't her loyal group rather small when you total the votes ? 
  as in , her platform will find it harder to attract other voters , unlike marcon who 's rather * safe/moderate * to vote for . 
  no but seriously now . 
  it does n't take a genius to notice that le pen is anti-eu and also very right-wing ( at least when it comes to foreign policy ) , and that people rally around * extreme * leaders when bad things happen . 
  nobody wants to hear `` we 'll continue business as usual '' or `` let 's not be hasty '' in such situations . 
  they want fast deportations . 
  whether any interested parties will/would like to actually try to make something terrible happen is a matter of debate ... and my paranoia , so i 'll refrain from trying to draw some objective conclusions ( . _ . ), 
  yea afaik he 's seriously likely to win , this is n't comparable to trump and clinton , who were much closer in odds . 
  * unless something drastic happens in the next two weeks , like `` certainly not suspicious e-mail leaks '' , or god forbid , a major terrorist attack . 
  wait . 
  what happens if the 2nd place is tied ? 
  all 3 go into 2nd round , or ... ? 
  yep . 
  but i did n't even need to look at critical responses and ridiculous methodology , [ the map itself made me / headdesk ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/national_iq_per_country_-_estimates_by_lynn_and_vanhanen_2006.png ) . 
  then i looked at the listing/actual values ... [ it 's frankly disgusting . 
  ] ( https://iq-research.info/en/page/average-iq-by-country ) do people even understand that iq below 70 is where someone can call you medically retarded ? 
  whole swathes of africa are supposed to be drooling all over the place , according to that study . 
  i 'd bet it 's [ this ridiculous study . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iq_and_the_wealth_of_nations ) that thing makes no logical sense , but i guess that many people who `` are n't racist , but ... '' like to take nonsense like that for granted . 
  side-note , regardless of the `` discussion '' : your username is lame . 
  are you serious ? 
  i guess you get some points for originality , at least it 's not an orwell quote , and does n't have much to do with `` seize the memes of production '' , or whatever is * cool * these days . 
  but implying that europe is going into some kind of doom ... smh , every time . 
  live in a city that 's fairly close to it . 
  can confirm , billion mosquitoes ; _ ;, 
  wat what 's going on here ? 
  marcon has fangirls ? 
  why did i miss this ? 
  is there a club ? 
  i only knew about trudeau, 
  [ relevant polandball ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/lklmahm.png ) ( though mind you maybe it backfired ? 
  as in , now france leans too-left ? 
  is it all your fault again , njema\u010dka ?? 
  i know , his odds were clearer/better than those in french elections . 
  it also helps that france has two rounds , and of the 4 main candidates , one is absolutely anti-eu , while the other is ... 
  i do n't know . 
  he could be a well-meaning but sober reformer ( as in , maybe he can be negotiated with for some middle ground , lord knows that eu * does * have some issues ) ... or he could be a copy of david cameron ( and look how well that turned out ) . 
  but on a whole , the reports i got about usa were rather confused , trump looked like an improbable clown to me , and as i said , my friends reassured me that it 'll be a close match but that he wo n't win . 
  turns out they 're those coastal folks living in their bubble/underestimating the rust belt . 
  you speak as if post-wwii was a good time for the other side , the one to the east of the iron curtain . 
  it sucked , period .
