  and do n't forget what kind of an uneasy peace that was , usa and ussr pointing nukes at each other , same nukes that would most likely meet somewhere in central europe and turn it into glass . 
  that 's not `` peace '' . 
  that 's a stand-off . 
  trump was mildly concerning , but my american friends told me he wo n't win ( so i did n't panic beforehand ) , and he 's on the other side of the atlantic anyways . 
  i was writing my final college thesis during brexit , so i never paid much attention . 
  turkey was more concerning than trump ( and arguably even brexit , because they 're so close to my clay ) , but then again i do n't expect they can do a ton against eu all on their own . 
  but here in the french elections , eu is basically at stake , much much more than it was during brexit . 
  if france is out , party 's over . 
  for context , i barely care for my own country 's elections , our left and right are almost equally incompetent/corrupt , but they 'd never do anything drastic . 
  for one of the small clays that can barely prosper and be protected within the eu , much less without it , i 'm scared about an election for the first time in my life . 
  megathread was getting overcrowded , mods would need to set it to sort by / new immediately if we wanted to follow the situation live . 
  plus , it was old , would n't show up in people 's frontpages ( assuming that they browse by / front ) . 
  ohhh , spare me that argument . 
   hungary , for example , has offered no places but was allocated a quota of 1,294 1294 ... in a country of 9,8 million . 
  and then  indeed , under current offers of places , there are 5,989 spaces unused , including 40 in slovenia , 480 in romania , 1,298 in bulgaria and 100 in poland . 
  those are hilariously tiny numbers . 
  as for uk , look at the stats : 115 * per million * . 
  if 115 per million can `` steal dem jobs '' , i do n't even know what to say . 
  besides , from what i heard brexiters complaining about , it was the eastern europe bringing wages down ( again , solved by better enforcement of lawful minimum wage ) , plus people who are neither from eu , nor asylum seekers - `` those damn pakis '' was the wording used . 
  eu has nothing to do with those . 
   for a start , stop saying you are pro-european when first and foremost you are pro-eu . 
  yes , theres a difference . 
  i never understood that argument . 
  people that are anti-eu usually say `` yes , but we 're not anti-europe , eu is not europe '' . 
  well for sure it is n't , but europe without eu is just a bunch of countries that happen to share the same geographical continent . 
  it 's no different from any other continent ... except , if my memories of history lessons is correct , * this fine continent * kept robbing and butchering itself for thousands of years . 
  if that 's what they call `` fine european identity '' , i 'll pass . 
  but what intent ? 
  my country 's in the same eu . 
  we 're not bringing in `` waves of immigrants to keep the machine running '' , or whatever the plan is . 
  so , if certain countries are doing that , it 's their own decision , not the eu 's . 
  it 's especially glaring for uk , who could have put those temporary caps on immigration from other parts of eu ( iirc it goes up to 7 years ? 
  ) , but mostly did n't . 
  that 's the uk government 's doing . 
   while bringing in an immigrant army to do the jobs cheaper and drive wages down . 
  or , you can have a minimum wage for the worst jobs , and nobody , immigrant or native , can work for less that that . 
  if your country has employers paying off the books , then it 's the employers ' fault - and the fault of the country that ca n't enforce its own rules . 
  for heaven 's sake , this is not just about immigrants . 
  we barely have any , and we still struggle to kill the grey economy - * someone * will always be willing to work for less than the minimum wage . 
  i love that whole comic to bits . 
  by the time it came to `` our opinions have not achieved perfect harmony yet '' , i was sold, 
  it 's not just dubrovnik , you can find such `` streets '' in split , \u0160ibenik etc etc. 
  i guess when you live between the mountain and the sea , every * passage * that cars ca n't go through counts as a street . _ . 
  ... insert accordion music ? 
  yes , well , you still have more islands than we do  :( (, 
  but even outside of school , media helps . 
  ( we learn german in school as well , almost as many classes as english , yet we ca n't speak it half as well ) . 
  we do n't dub anything outside of kid cartoons , and of course there 's most of internet being in english ( at least at the beginning ) , so much music etc etc. 
  as a couch-potato kid , i basically learned by accident - or maybe it 's not accident , maybe they sub instead of dub as a part of a * cunning plan * :p, 
  aside from kugla vanilij * e * , it 's perfect !, 
  i 've heard it said that the english are * beerwolves * : normal-ish northern euros at home , crazy drunken werewolves elsewhere . 
  it 's not the moonlight but the orange glow of the easyjet cabin that sets them off \\ ^ ^, 
  [ relevant in the last 3 panels ? 
  would n't know , never had an empire to lose . 
  do n't know how you formerly-massive countries banter with each other ... we just ca n't into relevance here, 
  most of your questions are answered in the article , i wo n't reiterate here . 
  and i 'm rather impatient with orwell comparisons because : 1 . 
  `` orwellian '' has been overused by everyone and their grandma to the point it lost nearly all meaning ( or , if everyone is a nazi then nobody is a real nazi ) 2 . 
  people - western people , to be more exact - cry orwell when they have never experienced `` orwellian '' in their life , for context , see soviet union and whether it 's even remotely comparable 3 . 
  wrong literature !, 
  if we 're going by amazing books everyone quotes because they 're amazing , everyone read them , and quoting them makes you look smarter , then the modern western world - and its problems - is waaaay closer to * brave new world * than * 1984 * . 
  when we 're going about access to information already , it 's not that the west lacks info , like in 1984 . 
  it 's that the people are constantly bombarded with the abundance of * worthless information * . 
  maybe it 's the catchy war-songs ? 
  why does everyone always jump to orwell , whenever free speech is concerned ? 
  comparing * this tool * to orwell 's ministry of truth is like comparing a bee sting with your arm getting hacked off . 
  i believe they call it `` the slippery slope fallacy '' . 
  you can spread whatever lying propaganda from paid shills you want , you can claim that sweden is under sharia law at the moment , but you do n't have the right to be protected from people calling bullshit on that . 
  flag that nonsense with `` this is a lie '' , because it is a lie , and it 's not being used for some innocent freedom-purposes either . 
  let 's not be naive about how lying propaganda is having a field day on the internet . 
  hm , but the thing about working hours , do n't you have a weekly cap on it ? 
  or monthly , whatever , depends on the type of job you have . 
  how it works out over here : we have a 40-hour workweek . 
  some people get free weekends , but then they work 8 hours mon-fri . 
  some get free sundays . 
  some have the occasional shift on sunday , mostly morning , but that 's usually just stores , which comes in handy to all the people who do n't have the time to shop during the week ... and these stores , especially big malls , earn much more on sat-sun then during the week . 
  it 's from [ portugal the shit-rectangle ^ ^ : < ] ( http://i.imgur.com/bpxf5tv.png ) ( i get about half of my world knowledge from polandball nowadays . 
  some people said this makes me about as informed as half of the official negotiators ... ) ninja edit : hmmm , so he was n't hanging upside-down . 
  alright , that bit is my twisted imagination ( \u0361 \u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361 \u00b0 ), 
  `` drunken russian doing a racist impersonation of spanish while hanging upside-down and being strangled '' , i believe . 
  yep \\ ^ ^, 
  well , if the cheering about america first is a hint , they want to be the first-est in the world . 
  which to me does n't seem compatible with the notion of teamworking with * equals * . 
  eu countries put together can challenge america first much , much better than they can separately . 
  ( `` divide and conquer '' is about as old as rome . ), 
  ohhh , do n't even bother . 
  i 'll have you know that reliable sources ^ ^ tm leaked that germans actually do have a sense of humor , [ they 're just not allowed to show it in the presence of non-germans . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61mohf/me_today_at_pulseofeurope_in_cologne_germany/dffru16/?context=3 ), 
  strangest thing , while browsing polandball i somehow started * shipping * ball-representations of countries . 
  ( and i thought it could n't get any stranger than my yaoi-fangirl teenaged days . ), 
  [ example . 
  [ the pedestrian bridge . 
  ] ( http://i0.wp.com/bankovnikrediti.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/osijek.jpg?fit=846%2c564 ) it 's usually not very busy , and you can see most of the nicer parts of town from it . 
  [ i prefer the british version , too ~ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge4sxlgiaga ), 
  mm , idk if you read the books , the show did n't translate all the details properly ( and it went past the books in s06 ) . 
  but one interesting thing that can be observed from tywin : most of the great lords hated him , but did n't fear . 
  that 's why you had basically everyone declaring war on lannisters after robert died ( so lesson 1 : make sure you 're * scary enough * even to your equals ) . 
  then lannisters won the war sure , but that 's with some very fortunate plot magic ( like stannis droning renly ) , as well as help of the tyrells who were there because money , not obedience . 
  then it 's interesting to look at what happened after tywin 's death : his * legacy * was paraded naked around king 's landing , with peasants throwing poop . 
  so lesson two : obedience towards fear only works while you 're strong enough , after you weaken , nobody * cares * to defend you .
