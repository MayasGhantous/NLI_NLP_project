  ohhh , right . 
  we missed out on all that `` excitement '' with the bulgarians , probably because they 're too many mountain ranges away for any passive-aggressive relationships . 
  no , you were clear enough . 
  isis was n't involved in the planning of the attack , but the lunatic that did it shared the same ideology , so they 're taking credit in that way - the shining light that shares the truth of the world , down with the decadent west , holy war revolution , bla bla . 
  but the football analogy leads me on another tangent . 
  as far as i can tell , isis - and groups similar to it - would like to take credit in a way that makes it seem like this `` truth '' they fight for is difficult to perceive among the brainwashing lies from the establishment , whatever it may be . 
  but in my experience if the football hooligans did n't have the club to rally around , they 'd pick something else . 
  it 's not about ideology , but about feeling `` righteous '' about yourself while you beat people up . 
  huh , no ? 
  we do n't have any strong feelings about bulgarians . 
   `` cygan '' and `` rumun '' ok seriously , i `` knew '' that slavic languages are similar , but seeing it so much on this sub is kinda creeping me out . 
  like finding some long-lost cousin you never saw before , you know ? 
  it 's `` cigan/cigani '' here . 
  though fwiw we do n't equate them with romania , probably because it feels like they 've been here forever , no large scale immigration from romania in more recent times . 
  over here , of those that i met , some are cool people . 
  some tend to make their money by collecting scrap metal , and i do n't mean stealing - it 's that guy that drives around the place in a van , shouting `` old iron !, 
  give old iron hereee ! '', 
  but then again , others do n't get along so well , when i was keeping shop , i had to watch the resident roma kids like a hawk because they did tend to steal way more often than other kids . 
  now as to why these roma kids had a case of sticky fingers , that 's complicated . 
  but being poor is no excuse imo , plenty of people are poor here and they do n't steal , or at least not at the same rate . 
  and it 's a bit difficult to empathize when you 're working for a disgracefully low minimum wage and you have to pay from your own pocket for everything stolen from your shop  . <, 
  yea , `` rathaus '' bounces somewhere between `` rat-house '' and `` war-house '' , depending on which language i 'm thinking in . 
  so then i end up imagining a bunch of very war-like rats , and then it 's off to [ mine-sniffing rats , ] ( https://3c1703fe8d.site.internapcdn.net/newman/gfx/news/hires/inallittakes.jpg ) and they 're so cool + adorable . 
  rats being bros !, 
  debatable , i think . 
  they went on about hillary for a long time after she became a political non-factor . 
  ah , let the merican be . 
  it is a bit tone deaf to compare tu\u0111man to death squads and the native american mess , but keep in mind that foreigners hear conflicting reports about the war , there * was * at least some level of shadiness from our side ( like for example the earlier plan to partition bosnia , also i would n't put it past del ponte to at least try to trial tu\u0111man for storm , regardless of whether it 'd have worked ) , also as others pointed out , he was responsible for the nasty `` privatization '' of the 90 's . 
  tbh i 'm not all that happy with the name either  . < i think the intention was more - just about everyone has memorials to controversial figures . 
  uh , it 's a reference to monty python . 
  [ this bit . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7tvauojmho ), 
  i heard that they 're using the diamond money to invest in more long-term stuff like education , the financial sector etc. 
  so at least they 're not blind to the dangers of reliance on mining , more like using it for a head-start . 
  * what have the brits ever done for us ? 
  bah , i 've seen him around , yes . 
  and i usually stay away from these ... debates ... precisely because i tend to go on a rant , plus it 's a tired old topic anyways . 
  but yeah , penkala would have been much better !, 
  never heard of anyone having mixed feelings about him . 
  now we have zoki 's ridiculous attempts to look hip to the right-wingers to thank for this ... not that it helped him in elections  . <, 
  to be fair , that 's because there are basically no terrorist attacks here , in general . 
  we 're just not interesting enough to various `` holy crusaders '' against the rotten west , or whatever their schtick is . 
  of course they 'll attack - `` make examples of '' - usa/uk/germany / france/brussels . 
  [ we know you just adopted him !, 
  they are spreading , * one burek at the time . 
  hm , but you improved too . 
  in the 2015 list i linked , you were in the `` high '' box instead of `` very high '' like now . 
  climbed up 2 spots same as we , both of us also had the total of `` 0.004 '' improvement . 
  which is nothing to sneeze at apparently , the only improvements stronger than that are `` 0.006 '' , belonging to russia and italy . 
  so - congrats , 
  we like you too !, 
  which is a good thing really , not sure how it happened but seemingly all of our bakeries are yours !, 
  i suspect a plot , but since we 're ok with you it 's fine i guess . 
  i 'm still salty at the grammatical genders !, 
  how can * m\u00e4dchen * be das , it 's literally a noun that = girl , i ask you :o, 
  yay !, 
  montenegro , [ we and you are not in the total ass-end of the cool kids anymore !, 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index#very_high_human_development ), 
  i suppose it depends on how you look at it . 
  to some , only ukraine/belarus/russia are ee , some include romania and bulgaria , to some everything east of germany and austria is ee . 
  and almost nobody wants to be labeled as such :d as my personal anecdote , i felt more at home in czech republic than in germany/austria/italy . 
  to me it means that we 're both ee , or we 're both central , or we 're some kind of a mashup \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  but wait , how long do they `` stay russian '' ? 
  i mean , on first glance , what you 're proposing seems as strange as for example germany producing specific entertainment for their turkish minority . 
  it 's assumed that minorities/immigrants will integrate in the society they arrived in , right ? 
  do you have a lot of first-gen russians , or do they stay separate through generations ? 
   i 'm still working out the details of how their plan , how about ~ `` we do n't want your money '' `` we already have it '' `` we make sure nothing sad happens to it '', 
  no , no , i mean - they 've been neutral for centuries . 
  and other folks mostly left them alone . 
  so they probably have less reason to be salty at europe ? 
  does n't have to mean anything , i think . 
  we have the same coffee habits - drinking it in any kind of company , at least until 10 pm ( when we switch to beer ) , but apparently we 're not that high in total consumption . 
  it 's probably because we nurse one cup for hours , that 's how our coffee shops are always full . 
  hmm . 
  maybe it 's just a matter of personal taste , then ? 
  i always thought that people that do n't like coffee because it 's bitter just have n't gotten used to it - it was an acquired taste for most of the people i know . 
  my example , i did n't like it as a kid , but nowadays i genuinely like the bitter-sweet taste . 
  but then again , i also hated the `` bitter '' chocolate before , while today i 'll take aztec chocolate over every more-sugary choice \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  all of europe has a bone to pick with all of europe . 
  except for the swiss , i suppose . 
  & nbsp ; ^ ^ ( we & nbsp ; were & nbsp ; with & nbsp ; you & nbsp ; for & nbsp ; 800 & nbsp ; years , & nbsp ; and & nbsp ; we & nbsp ; still & nbsp ; do n't & nbsp ; understand & nbsp ; word & nbsp ; you 're & nbsp ; saying . ), 
  ^ ^ ( you & nbsp ; special & nbsp ; ugro-finnic & nbsp ; snowflake & nbsp ;  . < ) ^ ^ ( can & nbsp ; we & nbsp ; skip & nbsp ; that & nbsp ; part & nbsp ; first ? ), 
  pffft , that 's delusional . 
  saying that they banned us for something implies that they noticed we exist outside of the tourist season . 
  ca n't into relevance !, 
  ( therefore i 'm salty at slovenia being more relevant . ), 
  but did n't the famous scientist nikos teslapoulos prove that we 're all actually greek, 
  [ tbh i prefer this one .

  i submitted the map that was later edited with new information , [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/mapporn/comments/5kqa2u/first_printing_presses_in_europe_with_respect_to/dbx76tn/ ) . 
  i saw this map show up yesterday in the ottoman thread , quick search did n't show the link on r/europe . 
  thought it might be interesting to look at , 
  not a direct neighbor , but ~ as i see it , it 's a foregone conclusion that some economies and armies are/will be stronger than others . 
  so being nervous about the `` bigger fish '' is just a matter of changing labels - it can be usa , or russia , or germany , does n't change the fact that we 're small and crunchy and taste good with ketchup . 
  and if i could choose between bad and worse , i suppose i 'd rather that the most relevant army was european than from usa . 
  yeah , we 've had a few thousand years of bad history here , but in the more recent times usa has a spottier track record when it comes to policy ( see : middle east , electing a meme into office ) .
