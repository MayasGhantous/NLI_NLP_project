  so just in case eu falls apart . 
  you 're all still gon na vacation here for a symbolic sum of euromonies , yeees ? 
  this is a pretty insightful comment . 
  i think most of it is spot on ( except maybe the bit about change , though idk if my perspective is skewed because i feel like change is n't happening fast enough ) . 
  in regards to the whining , pessimism , people quitting and just moving to greener pastures ... this is going to be long , hope i can make sense . 
  you have to look at historical context as well as present-tense , because our `` identity '' was born at least 150 years ago , when most `` nations '' became what we think when we say * nation * in a modern sense . 
  so : this bit of clay we have here is n't the worst in the world , but it 's not the best either ( few internal resources , mostly lame soil , crossroads of 3 continents ) . 
  throughout middle ages , we had ottomans and venice trying to bite off chunks . 
  being pessimistic/wary about human nature becomes a survival skill . 
  meanwhile , we were within various forms of austro-hungary for 800 years , so we do n't even have some `` glorious old days when we pawn 'd x '' as some point of pride . 
  not that a-h was bad , you do n't stay with someone for so long if it 's bad , but still - you 're the little fish . 
  then in 19th century where `` national consciousness '' was built in a modern sense , same a-h did go bad , it was literally trying to turn us into hungarians ( one of the many reasons we nope 'd out after wwi ) . 
  our unified language , culture etc etc become a real thing while stronger powers were literally trying to wipe it out of existence . 
  post wwi , the original idea of uniting into yugoslavia was - aside from `` we 're all small here , united we 're stronger '' - the hope of getting better autonomy in yugoslavia than what we had in a-h . \\* cue hysterical laughter * yugoslavia 1 literally shot our leading opposition politician - stjepan radi\u0107 - in the middle of the parliament ... because he was campaigning for greater autonomy for croatia . 
  so much for `` brotherhood and unity '' . 
  then you had wwii , in which [ this happened . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/65yls0/what_do_you_know_about_croatia/dggt8if/ ) after that there 's yugoslavia 2 , which did n't suck quite as badly as y1 , [ but it still sucked . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_spring ) fast forward to late 80 's . 
  tito is dead , and yuga is basically going full retard , and this in the circumstances of ussr being kill , which nullifies the importance of the neutral 3rd option . 
  meanwhile , seeing as we `` came to be '' as a people in the form of eternal underdogs , you have this `` 1000-year dream of freedom '' being bandied about , the notion of croats always being under somebody else 's boot which is bad , so `` we 'd like some independence now , thnx '' . 
  there 's a war . 
  it 's bad . 
  but those that did n't run away , well they 're actually optimistic , under the assumption that things will * finally * look up after we 're free . 
  all the good pr usa/west spread about democracy and capitalism ( by tv mostly ) is helping . 
  the war is over , we sober up ... and we realize that while we were fighting , * the people that were supposed to lead us , our fellow croats * robbed the country blind ( and this on top of the war damage , smth like 20-25 % of our economy was literally leveled ) . 
  communist pigdogs just transform into capitalist pigdogs . 
  so ... this is where you just quit , because you give up on hoping that * anyone * in this world will give 3 shits about the common man ... or even some minimal decency and responsibility . 
  and yes , we did lose a decade of development [ starting with 90 's , ] ( http://www.mindthismagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/croatian-gdp-per-capita-from-1990-to-2010.png ) and even before that our yugo-communism was n't much to write home about . 
  so of course we wo n't change into germany in a decade , but ... things are basically 10x harder than what we hoped for . 
  so while i agree with you that quitting does n't make sense , the people here are so very tired of struggling , and we have little idea on * where to even start * , how do you fight corruption when it 's ingrained in the marrow of your country ? 
   it 's tragically funny ( there must be word for these 2 together . . ) hmm so `` schadenfreude '' is getting your kicks out of someone else 's misfortune . 
  too narrow/doesn ' t apply here . 
  ... ca n't think of any other words in english/german . 
  we have `` tragikomedija '' here ( as a literary genre , but can be used for me_irl as well ) , you can borrow it for old times sake ? 
   i imagine bosnian croats being like greek cypriots ... from what i know about greeks and greek cypriots , that 's an excellent comparison . 
  never saw it worded like that , so - thank you for this comment , 
  was n't / r/ukpolitics created to balance out the story ? 
  as in , r/uk is apparently too leftist/gloomy / * remoaner * , so politics splintered off to be kinda neutral ? 
  ( tbh politics does seem a little more centrist/less * we 're doomed * when i occasionally glance at those two . 
  and to be fair i 'd say that the percentage of uk quacks is fairly low here on r/europe . ), 
  as far as i can tell he 's a regular troll . 
  only unlike executivemonkey ( say a prayer for the murican soldier o7 ) , he 's not funny/he may actually mean it . 
  res tags are a beautiful thing . 
  yes yes , but if you all go like `` hold my wine/hon hon hon '' this weekend , we all reserve the right to eternally mock you for following the uk 's lead . 
  ( side-note : is calling them `` rosbif '' actually popular in france ? ), 
  so what i 'm saying is , france pls * save us , obi wan marconi !, 
  \\* elizabeth taylor , richard burton , sophia loren , carlo ponti , and gina lollobrigida visited me on my islands intensifies *, 
  ha , i found out about the cat thing from their [ america first ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svdr-y03xx4&amp;t= ) video , which had me in stitches . 
  there were seriously a lot of awesome america first videos , but imo iran is somewhere in the top 5 . 
  in general i was tickled pink that basically most of the world engaged in hilarious political hooliganism ( i mean , * namibia * of all places joined the fun pretty early on , and now that i think of it your south africa was fun too \u2661 ) . 
  and then it 's a fun way to learn about different places in the world . 
  dry wikis and cia fact-bases do n't tell you a lot about the humor ( both self-depreciating and banter ) . 
  lebanon i could see , but iran is too big and too ready to go ballistic to get outright invaded like that . 
  economic sanctions and political isolation are more likely . 
  ( and i actually hope nothing unfortunate happens to their territory , if for nothing else then it 's cause they 're the only [ cat-shaped country ] ( https://iranian.com/features/2002/november/cat/images/1a.jpg ) i 'm aware of . 
  i mean ... * look at those tiny , cute little cat ears * ;d ) * as for eastern yurop , communism and various dictatorships sucked , period . 
  giving much credit to the west is like saying that you need a lot of effort to `` convince '' the people to take back the potato politburo took . 
  were n't there some talks with tunisia ? 
  about building those detention centers on some spots of land tunisia does n't need much ? 
  so the idea would be to pay tunisia some sum of money for that , plus whatever 's needed to keep the centers running . 
  ( cheaper than letting everyone into europe . ), 
  then , obviously make it known that the farthest they 'll get is tunisia - they 're not the reason all these people are taking the trip , so the pressure should go down . 
  because as things stand , with or without eu , immigrants will stop trying to illegally get into europe ... once europe becomes another shithole . 
  have you ever been to war ? 
  seen it come into your city ? 
  experienced the consequences of it , which do n't go away by `` winning '' ? 
  i 'm guessing you have n't . 
  be silent then . 
  hm , maybe it 's the number of kosovo-albanians over here ? 
  if you ask anyone , they seem to somehow own every single small bakery in croatia . 
  i suspect a plot , but since it 's delicious , ca n't make myself care \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  i hear you , and i agree . 
  that is , i agree in principle . 
  i do n't think realpolitik works like that . 
  since we 're talking about wwii and nazis anyways , question : how many people give three shits about massive war crimes committed against germany ? 
  or hell , how many even dare * truly condemn * usa for leveling hiroshima and nagasaki ? 
  of course scale is important , what the red army did and what usa did does n't compare to the holocaust and nanking , numbers - and motivation - matter . 
  but since people like `` black and white '' narratives , the good - well , less bad , that 's how war works - guys committing atrocities is n't treated with equal condemnation . 
  and history is at least somewhat written by the winners , there 's reporting facts , and then there 's reporting different facts with different * tones * , minimizing one side or the other by omission etc. 
  then look at what germany and japan did next : they humbly apologized . 
  they turned a new leaf . 
  and that did n't destroy them , [ on the contrary . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/61yxz1/each_countrys_top_import_partner_xpost_rmappon/dficu4x/ ) they also got a lot of help rebuilding from the good guys ... we did n't . 
  we got another 45 years of shitty communism and dictatorship , and unfortunately that was done by the `` good guys '' . 
  so i get how/why people get confused about ndh and partisans , but ... nobody outside of ex-yu cares about that ( we do n't even have the advantage of being too relevant to ignore , like germany and japan ) . 
  so it 's about bloody time * everyone * here stopped insisting that `` za dom spremni '' is actually just a patriotic greeting ( like it somehow does n't matter that usta\u0161e used it and therefore tarred it with a stain that does n't wash away ) , because we may as well be talking to a wall . 
  \u0160ta je on neki resident troll ? 
  well tbf russia is bigger than some continents . 
  if i had to choose , i 'd call most russians european ( both because most live in the european part , but also long and involved history ) , but in general to me russia is just this ... land unto itself . 
  get lost mate, 
  that 's because we 're morons . 
  so ndh , aside from going full hitler , also happened to be fighting for an independent croatia ( nevermind them being nazi muppets , that was the official line ) . 
  because yugoslavia sucked even in its first incarnation , we either wanted out or greater autonomy ( why does this sound familiar ? ) . 
  partisans went the opposite way , preserving yugoslavia and not being nazi muppets ( because seriously , nazis suck ) . 
  and the whole partisan movement started in croatia , it fought against ndh * and * germany , it was one of the rare cases ( or the only one ? ), 
  where outsiders ' intervention was n't all that necessary to get rid of ze germans , hell tito was born and raised in croatia and his mother was a slovene , while father was a croat . 
  and partisans - and allies - won . 
  so instead of pr marketing * that * , our idiots go on and on about `` sovereignty '' , `` but partisans also had war-crimes '' , `` communism sucked '' , `` yugoslavia sucked even more '' . 
  ** as if anyone cares . 
  yep .
