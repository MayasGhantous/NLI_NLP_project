  in case you want to fit in with the [ tourist-stereotypes ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3amdy3/croatian_stereotypes_about_european_tourists/ ) , here 's for australia ( seems to fit with what i observed for aussies when on vacation ) :  `` the australians pay for ten days , end up in the local beer hall the first evening and you do n't see them the next nine days . 
  they come back on the tenth day , wearing the same t-shirt and shorts you saw them in when they arrived . 
   they panic looking for the passport , they are late for the flight . 
  they hug and kiss your mother , say hello to the neighbor who is watering her garden , although you are not speaking to her . 
   they yell greetings at all passers-by , wave to everybody who looks their way . 
  you and your neighbor wave back ( you are professionals , after all ) . 
  when the australians are out of sight you tell her to fuck off and drink a glass of water with sugar to get your breath back . 
   do n't worry about the australians not catching the flight , 'cause they are born lucky , forever lucky . 
  there 's always a long line , delayed departure or something . 
  whether they are late three hours or three days the plane will not leave without them . '', 
  iirc ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) , the caucasus theory comes from the iranian [ tanais tablets ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tanais_tablets ) , written somewhere in the proximity of rostov-on-don . 
  the croatian name for croat - hrvat ( horvat ) is apparently also iranian in origin , at least linguistically . 
  so the theory is that before central europe ( around slovakia ) , we came from the general direction of the caucasus . 
  mind you , it 's rather foggy . 
  same for most theories trying to figure where we came from to central europe - too many missing records etc. 
  do you want to get labeled as `` national enemy '' ? 
  because this is how you get labeled as national enemy, 
  right . 
  that link lists the reasons people are outraged , but i still find it hard to grasp the actual why . 
  would they get less angry if she threw the can at the cop ? 
  if she was n't a kardashian ? 
  if appropriately grave music played in the background ? 
  this is the kind of hilarious outrage that only makes the protesters look stupider . 
  found how many czechs never came around to try to climb biokovo in flipflops !, 
  yes , but . 
  trump winning tells me there 's something seriously broken in usa . 
  and i do n't mean to go all `` yea it 's the bible-belt woman-hating racists that voted for him '' , as if it 's even possible for nearly-half of usa to be that way . 
  ( afaik the problem with hillary was simplifying the issue in such a way , `` boooo you racists ! '' ), 
  his campaign promises went from moderate sense ( we have a problem with illegal immigration ) to la-la land nonsense ( we 're gon na build a wall and make mexico pay for it ) . 
  he promised to bring back jobs to the impoverished workers , which ignores that a ) capitalism goes to wherever the grass is greenest , if you mean to compete with china in terms of mass-production , you better accept chinese * wages * , and b ) jobs are going the way of the dodo on planet earth , * we welcome our new robot overlords * . 
  that example is telling me that usa has a concerning number of people who fell into the cracks , and that same people believe that massive , complex problems can be solved in a twinkling with a proper `` can do '' attitude . 
  basically , around half of usa fell for unrealistic populism . 
  ( or more than half , afaik that bernie was also promising some naive stuff . ), 
  and this is not happening only in usa ( though usa being the strongest country on earth makes it more concerning ) , and i do n't think it 's going to change any time soon . 
  til about usa 's ... `` test banks '' ? 
  wait , what is that ? 
  do they have the same exams every year , or something ? 
  what we have over here sounds similar to what you describe for uk . 
  depending on the specific course ofc , but usually the questions change from year to year up to a point - there 's only so many ways you can test the knowledge of most college courses , unless somebody invents `` new hot water '' in the meantime . 
  in general , the specifics usually change in the test - you ca n't ctrl+v the old answers - but `` informing yourself '' about what kind of stuff the professor asks about is perfectly acceptable . 
  hell , many of them let you take a blank copy home ... easier to figure out why you failed * again * that way :p, 
  side-note , you 're `` ma\u0111ari '' here ( \u0111 reads like the first sound in french jean ) . 
  so you see , we did pick up at least one word in all those centuries of a-h !, 
  i understand what you 're saying , it 's easier to use country of origin . 
  and it 's more politically correct . 
  but it 's also very misguided in this * specific * case imho . 
  we call them roma ( cigani in colloquial mostly ) , they 're called roma/gypsies elsewhere , and from what i can tell , they have the exact same behavior and culture * everywhere * . 
  for example i listen to some bulgarian/swede/etc complaining about something the roma did , and they may as well be talking about my roma . 
  so ... labeling the country of origin is rather useless in this case ... they came from northern india ( iirc ) , and they came with a distinct nomad-like culture that acknowledges no state boundaries . 
  reverse trianon reverse trianon 1920 worst year of my life !, 
  ... seriously ? 
  i mean i get giving each other all the points in eurovision , but football ? 
  our own bbb and torcida wo n't cheer for each other against 3rd teams , just out of sheer `` principle '' . 
  i do n't think i 've ever heard of * anyone * not liking the irish . 
  ( well , except for the english . ), 
  they 're either cool what with the music and the pubs , or at most people will feel sorry for their troubles with the english . 
  edit : about driving . 
  most of it should n't be a problem , aside from finding parking spots in the most crowded areas . 
  the small coastal roads also sometimes get jammed up ( depending on time of season , day , whether it 's weekend , but i think you should be fine one month from now ) . 
  but on the motorways , pay attention to poles/czech/slovaks , especially if they 're going south . 
  they 're the most frequent car-crashes over here , mostly because many of them drive from their homes in * one day * , which is a long trip , so by the end the driver is getting tired :o, 
  if you 'll rent to go to plitvice , why not simply keep the car for the whole visit ? 
  ( not sure about pricing difference as well as the whole logistics , you 'd better ask in our [ tourist megathread ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/62x90n/2017_croatia_tourist_thread_ask_anything/ ) about it , coastal locals should know better than me . ), 
  if there 's one thing i 'll say to tourists it 's : * do n't do the usual thing * . 
  many tourists come by cruiser or plane , do n't rent a car , and then they jostle with all other tourists on the walls of dubrovnik in the peak of the peak season ... because the walls of dubrovnik are in literally every tourist-brochure . 
  now that 's because it 's worth seeing them - of course - but for example if you 're looking for a nice * non-crowded * beach , you wo n't find it in the middle of a popular city . 
  meanwhile , [ the whole coast from split to omi\u0161 / makarska/dubrovnik ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/southern_croatian_adriatic.png ) is basically one big beach an hour/two away by car . 
  as for the two days in dubrovnik - i 'd recommend you visit [ lokrum ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=lokrum&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjxhevjwa7tahvckiwkheu9cucq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818&amp;dpr=1.13 ) ( there are regular ferries ) on the 2nd , one day is enough to see most of the old city . 
  well split -  plitvice is just around 3 hours by car ( iirc ) . 
  and there are plenty of cheap buses to take you there ( though maybe reserve a ticket in advance ) if you think renting a car is too much hassle . 
  but i 'd seriously recommend that if you wo n't go to both , then better go to plitvice alone . 
  yea krka has the advantage of letting you bathe in the water , but it 's much smaller , and ... ok , from my limited exposure to the rest of the world , only the [ greek meteora ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=meteore&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewir9ko9u67tahwciswkhwctchwq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818&amp;dpr=1.13#tbm=isch&amp;q=greek+meteora ) compares in how * surreal * it is ( if you ever go to greece , to hell with the coast if you wo n't visit meteora ! ) . 
  [ those pics you see around , ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=meteore&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewir9ko9u67tahwciswkhwctchwq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818&amp;dpr=1.13#tbm=isch&amp;q=plitvice+lakes ) most of them are n't put in any filter - colors really are that funky , and you have around 5-6 hours of walking along such paths . 
  it was bad enough when i was a kid and my canadian uncle 's girlfriend said how everyone giggled at her when she 'd say `` and then i 'm going to split '' , but now reddit taught me we have a dick-city in romanian . 
  i mean ... what 's next ? 
  well , they did anschluss most of it [ at one point . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/hrvatski_skolski_muzej_zemljovid_3_300109.jpg/1024px-hrvatski_skolski_muzej_zemljovid_3_300109.jpg ) it did n't last very long to be fair , but we never did regain western bosnia etc ; _ ; on the other hand , their food and coffee is awesome , so i 'm rather ambivalent about it all ... ohhh who am i kidding . 
  who my overlord is seems slightly less irl-relevant than the precious , sanity saving coffee :p, 
  ah , read the article , did n't watch video . 
  our coast having `` tourist traps '' is well-known to us . 
  and that ends up in discrimination of foreign tourists because obviously they wo n't be that familiar with the place , so they 'll go for the most obvious/easiest locations like the literal center of dubrovnik/etc , while the locals know better - or just have more patience - so they move a street or two away where prices miraculously evaporate to half . 
  euro is a kinda-problem too afaik , the conversion is n't exactly 1 eur = 7 kn , so while the locals may accept eur , they 'll round it up instead of down ( what sorcery is this ?? ) . 
  this is why tourists are generally advised to exchange the currency and to research a bit before coming ( there must be thousands of reviews and tips starting with tripadvisor , hell we even have a reddit megathread on r/croatia ) , point being , if you go for the laziest mass-tourism , you 'll possibly get ripped off . 
  and that rovinj case you linked , there was outrage about it everywhere - it 's because it 's an * extreme * example . 
  where would that be ? 
  * and it 's not just the fields , from my limited exposure to your cities , most of our northern cities are similar to yours . 
  the south/coast meanwhile has a more italy/venice flavor . 
  pics taken yesterday with a lame-camera ... through the car window . 
  wanted to share because as far as i can tell most outsiders think `` sea '' when you ask them about croatia . 
  and it 's no wonder , the coast is promoted everywhere as a tourist resort , for obvious reasons : it 's pretty ( prettier ) than the continental parts , and same northern parts are mostly used for farming and industry , i do n't see that changing any time soon . 
  but the whole `` other half '' of croatia mostly looks like those pics , smaller hills/mountains rolling down into the panonian basin , mostly agricultural fields with the occasional forest . 
  i 'm sorry that you got downvoted to oblivion , when as far as i can tell you 're just pointing out the thought-process of outsiders . 
  it is a sore spot here , though . 
  and not just here , pan-slavic ideas did n't work out anywhere because originally they were supposed to be about us slavs being close cousins that should unite because united we 're stronk ( er ) , bla bla , and such unions were supposed to have equality ... but some people ended up being `` more equal '' than others ( cough , russia ) . 
  so you have bad history in the context . 
  and then a lot of historical ignorance in general . 
  i mean , i do n't exactly blame outsiders for not knowing , as if i 'm very familiar with the detailed histories of west euros/asia/americas / etc. 
  but it 's not just about language , i see outsiders claiming that everyone in ex-yu is the same ethnicity divided by religion and that the break-up of yuga was religion-based . 
  which is ...
