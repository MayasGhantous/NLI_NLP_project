  getting chased out with stick is * very extreme * even for my experience here . 
  that is , there is a dress code for churches , and i do n't recall ever seeing anyone not following it , maybe because it 's mostly locals that already know , or maybe because those that do n't were asked to leave . 
  but stick ...

  huh , wonder what emigration statistics would say about ireland , then ? 
  but seriously now . 
  emigration has been a thing here for ages , those other 4-5 million did n't leave in the last 20 years , for heaven 's sake `` gastarbajter '' has been our colloquial word for ex-pat since at least the 60 's . 
  it is problematic that the current population decline is extra bad here ( we never had that many people in the first place ... ) , however ... [ becoming an `` awesome place to live '' apparently does n't help .

  well ... logistical problems . 
  we 're in eu , they are not , so imagine we join schengen one day ( haha , ha ) and you have this tiny strip of coast bisecting the country . 
  or say you want to finally connect dubrovnik with the rest of the country by motorway , you have to negotiate with a different government for that . 
  ( assuming that eu would even treat neum as part of eu , which - of course it would n't . ), 
  and even though we 're cooperating well with bosnia when it comes to traffic , the queues sometimes get too epic . 
  i thought so too , but then i checked by wiki ( this sub is * ferocious * with alternative facts ) , and [ wiki says it was venice . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neum#history ) mind you ... 
  i guess it depends on how reliable wiki is : shrug :, 
  that tiny bosnian part of adriatic ... well . 
  the tl ; dr of what happened there was ragusa ( dubrovnik ) and venice going all like `` ewwww i 'm not gon na border those people '' , and then venice gave a strip of coast to the ottomans . 
  because that makes * perfect sense . 
  * fast-forward 3-and-some centuries and maybe half a dozen founding stones later ( promising to build a bridge `` in the next few years '' is one of the favorite campaign promises ) , looks like we 're finally building the damned bridge .

   everybody knows that marine le pen is corrupt , but it 's a surprise for nobody and its voters just do n't care at all . 
  huh . 
  so from my limited exposure , afaik she 's gained ground because she adopted some leftists policies . 
  basically promising help to the unemployed , strengthening economy , which the youth seems to be buying ? 
  ( iirc her greatest support is in the youngest age bracket . ), 
  soooo ... a populist politician promising a better life to those who fell into the cracks turns around and steals from the state ( one of the main reasons they fell into the cracks in the first place ) , and that does n't work out as incompatible ? 
  i generally agree that all but the most benign forms of islam are incompatible with any progressive society . 
  same goes for christianity & co , imo . 
  but i also think that blaming it all on islam , or at least saying that islam is the first problem , is wrong . 
  the world wars were n't fought in the name of god . 
  slavery was n't done in the name of god . 
  colonization was n't done in the name of god - or at least , the * motivation * was n't god but greed . 
  stalin was aggressively atheist , same as all other fine comrades . 
  the plot twist is that haters gon na hate , regardless of what their * excuse * is . 
  and religious people tend to be very us vs them , you attack `` islam/christianity/the great spaghetti monster '' and they see it as an attack on both what 's good ^ tm and themselves . 
  instead of saying `` your allah sucks/your allah does n't exist '' , i think it 'd be much more productive to say `` your society sucks because it 's violent/you stone people to death/your country is poor/etc etc '' . 
   yeah fillon is corrupt but the others are too well ... are n't they ? 
  a `` totally clean politician '' is an oxymoron . 
  imo choosing one or the other boils down to `` which one is * least * corrupt ? 
  '' , or corrupt/incompetent . 
  in fillon 's case , i guess that he was either unlucky to get caught with worst timing , or more likely , his corruption was just dumber/bigger . 
  ( though mind you , does n't le pen also have similar scandals around her ? 
  and yet her support does n't seem to be falling much . ), 
  does n't explain bulgaria , though . 
  they have 588 318 , or around 8.8 % of the total population . 
  serbia tries to migrate to bosnia ? 
  xd * mind you at least we got the [ teeth in one . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/eyjgvcm.jpg ) always thought we look like some kind of demented pacman-reject trying to eat bosnia !, 
  redditor asked me `` have you never had ... [ insert personal experience ] '' . 
  and i said no , i never had such an experience with any woman i ever interacted with . 
  if * your * personal experience is different , that 's fine . 
  nope . 
  that is : we can usually agree on `` this one is conventionally handsome '' and `` that one is an orc reject '' . 
  it 's the ones in the middle - most men , tbh - where we vary in degrees . 
  but even the womenfolk that are head-over-heels for their so 's wo n't claim said so 's are seriously handsome if they just are n't . 
  best you 'll get from them `` well he 's kinda-attractive * to me * '' , for which i blame the hormones . 
  umm ... did you drop your / s ? 
  [ ( depends on angle ) ] ( http://emptylighthouse-production.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/field/image/ad_1.jpg ) ( and we 're bitterly divided on that anyways ) ( this is worse than my memories of trying to decide which backstreet boy is best ), 
  i think it 's the other way around . 
  famous actors/actresses are deemed attractive * because * they would n't have become famous if they were n't attractive in the first place . 
  also , do n't underestimate [ the power of makeup . 
  ] ( http://cdn6.viralscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/kate-moss-without-makeup1.jpg ) as for those that look meh regardless ... yes , the extra factors can/do improve the situation . 
  but you ca n't exactly flip it 180 . 
  erdolini is n't meh , he 's a shade more `` handsome '' than danny devito . 
  well , yes . 
  as does charm , intelligence , humor etc etc. 
  but speaking as a woman that 's been analyzing - among other things - male beauty for more than a decade with other women of all ages and differing tastes ( different in * details * , at least ) , all these extra factors can turn for example a 6/7 into a 9/10 . 
  but they wo n't turn a goblin into a model , our eyes function just fine thank you very much :p that 's why those snarky tips on `` how to attract the opposite gender '' always have [ rule 1 : look attractive . ], 
  it 's not about good or bad candidates . 
  it 's about dictatorship not having * any * candidates because [ you do n't vote for kings ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl4ufirmtxg ), 
  true democracy is nonsense . 
  first , most voters are n't informed enough about most issues that need to be decided - this is why we have representative democracy , where the leaders are presumably experts with enough information and wisdom to make the right decisions . 
  but also , you have the tyranny of majority as a possible consequence . 
  minority rights * should n't * be up to the majority vote because - `` it does n't concern me -  idgaf '' . 
  same for certain human rights , period . 
  imo people democratically voting to usher in a tyranny also should n't be allowed . 
  it 's like ... being 100 % tolerant , this theoretical ideal goal of tolerance , results in people tolerating the intolerant . 
  `` we 're very multi-kulti ... unless you 're a nazi/islamist/racist / hateful little shitgoblin . '', 
  hmmm . 
  i remember you from other threads , especially the ones about the protests in serbia . 
  you were saying something along the lines of `` ehhh these snowflakes just do n't like the results of democratic elections '' , and this was about protests that were precisely against how undemocratic the serbian elections were . 
  vu\u010di\u0107 is sort of like an erdogan-lite , same suspicious ballots , propaganda over the media he controls , corrupt state etc etc. 
  now i 'm wondering if i 'll see you defending putin one of these days, 
  yes , yes , but . 
  ... handsome ? 
  i was skeptical about the very concept of two speed - and i still am , tbh , because i think too many divisions will just fracture the union even more . 
  and it was n't clear what exactly the requirements would be , and then the media/politicians presented the yay/nay votes as a division between east and west , rich and poor , etc etc. 
  then the first example of two speed came out ( the only one i 'm aware of so far , somebody please correct me if i 'm wrong ) .
