  it 's about the european public prosecutor 's office , which is supposed to `` combat financial fraud with eu funds '' . 
  [ 16 states signed up for it  ( http://www.euinside.eu/en/news/16-member-states-will-establish-the-eppo ) belgium , bulgaria , croatia , cyprus , the czech republic , germany , greece , spain , finland , france , lithuania , luxembourg , portugal , romania , slovenia and slovakia . 
  which is ... so much about divisions between rich/poor/east / west/etc . 
  as far as i can tell , it just boils down to the coalition of the * willing * ( so far ) . 
  depends on how you look at it imo . 
  on the face of it , i 'd agree that major changes should need the majority . 
  but ... if you look at turkey atm , the problem is blind faith/ignorance/lack of education , right ? 
  so , say you 're a country with a troublesome percentage of idiot-voters . 
  you want to introduce some good but major change . 
  how do you get the 2/3 to vote for it ? 
  educating your populace is * hard * and does n't happen overnight , so better if you need just a slight majority for something good , no ? 
  i 'm not surprised . 
  our diaspora also usually votes for right-wing , the same right-wing that 's been robbing the country blind for the last 20 years . 
  it 's because the right-wing does a lot of flag-waving , while the leftists are `` those unpatriotic * commies * '' . 
  then the same diaspora tries to lecture me how life over here actually works , even though they left 30 years ago . 
  when we 're at formatting already , [ add res to your desktop browser . 
  ] ( https://redditenhancementsuite.com/ ) among the dozens of handsome gizmos it has are the live preview and big editor , you can see how your post/comment will look in them . 
  so the voting should finish around an hour from now . 
  when do first preliminary results come in ? 
  as in , over here sometimes it takes almost until the next day to count everything up , but if voting finishes at for example 7 pm , you have 95 % correct reports around 8-9 pm . 
  the world has n't advanced as much as we may have hoped - seriously , the posturing between usa and russia is straight from the 80 's , same goes for the mess in the middle east , enduring mess in africa etc. 
  however . 
  yes , people overestimate the importance of war . 
  possibly because they think `` those pacifists are idealists '' , `` diplomacy is for the naive '' etc etc. 
  as in , humans are still greedy and prone to violence , so one must have a large army killing whatever people to be counted as powerful ? 
  but the beautiful thing about technological progress and white-collar robbery capitalism is that : a ) it makes war too costly , and b ) it gives the powers that be a way to get indecently rich by * trade * instead of war . 
  because if you ask me what the cause of every single historical war was , i 'd say `` greed '' . 
  and mostly greed by the leaders . 
  we simply found a different way to satisfy this greed . 
  that first pic ~ basically you cook the eggs in some kind of red-onion soup . 
  ( idk what the exact recipe is . ), 
  the details come from various nice leaves you gather , and make them stick to the egg by putting the whole thing in pantyhose . 
  so the color seeps through the hose , you get lighter patterns where the leaves were . 
  yeah , basic income is more a question of when instead of if . 
  even the jobs we think are reasonably safe - like teacher , doctor , artist - will be at least partially replaced by bots . 
  all you 'll have left is the 1 % that controls these bots , the difference being that the 99 % are n't poor , but literally penniless . 
  mind you , this is all assuming that society as we know it does n't become apocalyptic , in which case discussing income is moot point anyways .

  i like [ this one ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a5bjxrarl0 ) better ,

  the bold black line is the geographical limit , dark orange is political ( greece gets a pass because they 're older than anyone else in yurop , plus no commie ) . 
  i mean it 's one thing to be definitely balkan , another for it to kinda-not-count , depending who you ask ; _ ;,

  ] ( https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/18141-ec-expects-border-crossing-problems-to-be-solved ) that commissioner said , paraphrased : `` yea croatia and slovenia have to talk to each other about this . '', 
  talk about what ? 
  the fact that the new * brilliant eu idea * of `` verifying the documents of every eu citizen '' is causing traffic jams during easter holidays ? 
  and if you go back , the reasoning for these hilariously inept regulations is `` terrorism '' . 
  uh ... if * they * are coming from slovenia , what are they gon na do , blow up some beach here ? 
  ( our grand strategy is being safe-through-irrelevance . ), 
  as for the other direction , we hardly have any migrants here , terrorist or otherwise .

  nitpicking about done goofed , typo ? 
  mm , it 's the reichtangle . 
  there are two main interpretations , and i think that both of them may apply up to a point : + so the first is - people can do good , and have mostly good intentions . 
  but there 's usually something selfish/dark tucked away in all of us , as a part of our driving force . 
  + the * guilt * as a motivator . 
  i do n't think i have to explain that one .

  as far as i can tell , a lot of people think that children are reasonable people . 
  ... of course they are n't , this is why we do n't let them make important decisions . 
  children are little half-demons that constantly test the boundaries . 
  anyone who thinks that * reasonable discussion * can convince a kid in an obstinate-fit to quit howling never met a kid in an obstinate-fit . 
  for example ... 
  i was around 5 years old at the time . 
  coming home with my grandma after grocery shopping , after she would n't buy me some stupid toy . 
  so i cunningly waited until we were almost home , where other grannies gathered in the street to gossip . 
  that 's when i started howling , precisely to make a scene - i knew * exactly * what i was doing , wanted to embarrass her in front of other grandmas . 
  she smacked my ass for all the world to see ... and i never pulled shit like that again . 
  not because it hurt , or because she scared me , but because i was so * embarrassed * . 
  just the common thought process of a little 5-yo `` innocent angel '' that really wanted that toy ;d ( besides , if we go by `` emotional pain '' , getting a time-out , or getting toys taken away , was much much worse to me . ), 
  as far as i can tell , ours works out like the weed-laws . 
  nobody 's gon na arrest you for smoking a blunt . 
  with kids it goes like : anything harsh - think bruisers - is of course forbidden . 
  but some 4-5 year old kid howling up a storm that could wake the dead ? 
  and then getting a smack on the ass ? 
  yeah nobody 's gon na bother you for that . 
  * she and in my defense , the hdi map i linked - most of europe is various shades of green , with a few yellow 's . 
  africa is the opposite . 
  and to be fair , i think that most people who know anything about politics/economy/the world have the rough idea of tunisia for example being fairly advanced . 
  even if you ignore old history , they 're basically the only country where the arab spring worked out . 
  so generalizing `` it 's like africa '' mostly applies to , idk , 80-90 % of africa . 
  and yeah you * can * generalize about balkan too , nobody denies that we 're behind the north/west euros , but my point was , this `` behind '' to me feels like it 's saying `` you 're orange/red '' instead of `` you 're light green instead of dark green '' . 
  therefore - `` balkan is a shithole '' . 
  which it is n't . 
  ( or people have some first world ideas on what `` shithole '' actually means . ), 
  but .
