  fair enough , i should n't have generalized africa so much . 
  thanks !, 
  and yep , it 's mine . 
  i noticed the same , not just this sub but internet/irl in general . 
  so this has been brewing for a while . 
  and now that the dust has settled , it actually went better than i expected . 
  i seriously thought i 'll possibly sink to oblivion within the first hour , before i even get the chance to reach the hot page . 
  so - while the post was n't as active as i hoped in my impossible fantasies , it still went well enough . 
  ( i think the first problem is the length . 
  barring specific cases like idk , / r/askhistorians or similar long self-post and essay-length discussion subs , reddit usually has a short-ish attention span . 
  the simple economy of karma * timing vs the time it takes to read a post , well , it means that very short content flourishes here . ), 
  if you read through the comments , you 'll see that i also ask a similar question . 
  if it works for scotland and kosovo , why does n't the same apply for catalonia and bosna ? 
  i personally lean much more towards self-determination , but i also think there must be * some * limit . 
  for reference , there 's that onion article on the middle east ( automod does n't let me link it , you can find it under `` everyone in middle east given own country in 317,000,000-state solution '' ) . 
  but bosnia ... it 's not just srpska . 
  herceg-bosna wanted to separate and join croatia for a while during the war , too . 
  did n't work for them either . 
  i think dayton was the best that could be done to stop the carnage at the time , but it 's not a perfect long-term solution . 
  first problem with splitting bosnia apart , both back then and now ... [ this border-gore . 
  ] ( http://ontheworldmap.com/bosnia-and-herzegovina/map-of-ethnic-groups-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina.jpg ) how do you sort that logistical nightmare out ? 
  or have the bosniaks agree to cripple their country even more , what are they , born yesterday ? 
  and then , it remains to be seen if serbia and croatia would even want to incorporate these parts . 
  * back then * , maybe . 
  nowadays ? 
  ehhh . 
  we have enough problems to solve all on our own , incorporating herceg-bosna would be a bit like romania incorporating moldova . 
  our economy wo n't be able to handle it for a while yet . 
  i sailed from westeros to r/europe , and the next thing you know , i 'll turn into a responsible adult-ing adult irl !, 
  no but seriously now , i 'm taking a break from r/asoiaf fandom , if i have to argue who inherits the iron throne one more time ... !, 
  still modding , but i expect i 'll be back to the sub for real sometime around s07 . 
  side-note 1 : to be * definitely right * about asoiaf , one needs to read around 7000 pages of history . 
  to be equally , gloriously right about yurop , one needs to read ... 7000000 pages of history :o side-note 2 : who are the mannis-bros and dany-lovers of r/europe ? 
  eu-skeptics and federalists ? 
  i mean ... dany is constantly going on about `` breaking the wheel '', 
  hm , maybe it 's a matter of pov ? 
  from my own pov , whenever i 'd encounter some negative opinion about my country or my people ( which to be fair , is very limited outside of internet , mostly stories i 'd hear from people who traveled elsewhere , and even then the negative experiences were a small-ish section of interactions ) , it 's never `` haha well what can you expect from croatia '' , which would equate to your french example . 
  always `` haha balkans ! '', 
  we 're always this * group * that 's obviously clearly defined in the mind of the speaker , you know ? 
  it 's not like `` well of course the french complain/brits are snobby/greece must pay denbts/etc '' , it 's always just `` balkan '' , like a nasty word that explains everything . 
  re : the projection etc , i 'm also not entirely sold on that . 
  ( a bit too freudian for my taste , if for nothing else , then it 's because i do n't think outsiders * care * enough about us to `` project themselves '' . 
  as you say , it 's more likely that many/most of the stereotypes will concern close neighbors . ), 
  re : when it was written - apparently 1999 , so it 'll be outdated in several senses . 
  i do think he has a limited point in balkan being * safe * , or at least safer , to diss than other parts of the world . 
  for example ... you can freely say something negative about africa , lord knows they have problems . 
  but , say something rude about * africans * - i do n't think i have to list the common insults - and many/most people will look at you like \u0ca0_\u0ca0 or even in the height of refugee/terrorist crisis , person a says something negative about islam , give it a moment and person b will jump in with `` not all islam !!, 
  that 's racist ! '', 
  i do n't see much of the same for us . 
  perhaps because we really are safer , and easier for comparison . 
  i mean - boasting about how your country is better than the democratic republic of congo , well . 
  first , that 's like kicking a puppy , second , throwing `` banter '' at them will likely just sound racist . _ . 
  oh ... bosnia and kosovo are complicated . 
  well , i do n't have a lot of contact with kosovo , though at least i know it 's a thorny and complicated issue . 
  i lean mostly towards people 's right to self-determination , but . 
  if scotland and kosovo can secede , why does n't the same work for catalonia ? 
  or different bits of bosnia ? 
  or just about any random part of any state ? 
  and then mix up various interest groups in international politics , violent past , unclear rules and you have an unfortunate stew . 
  ( if you ask me , give the northern parts to serbia , the rest to kosovo or hell , even unite it with the rest of albania , but that 's just my * opinion * . 
  i 'm not qualified to judge here . ), 
  bosnia ... 
  i know a bit more about that . 
  imagine 3 roommates are in a 3-way relationship that 's hit-and-miss . 
  it becomes outright rape and beating at some point . 
  outsiders come in , and force the 3 roommates to keep on living in the same apartment indefinitely ... then the outsiders wonder why the 3 are n't cheerfully getting along 22 years later . 
  time can/does heal wounds , but seeing * that person * every day does n't really help , you know ? 
  hmm , not 100 % sure about romania , but did n't they have a seriously bad time in both communism and the transition time , which was in 90 's ? 
  of course there 's room for improvement , but have n't they come a long way since then ? 
  mind you , i hear you about first/only bad impressions sticking with someone for a long time . 
  well ... 
  i gave it at the end ? 
  it 's a 1:20 video where \u017di\u017eek humorously recaps the divisions in * cultured vs barbaric * europe . 
  tl ; dr of my own post which is more detailed and serious , when concerning balkan , 3 stereotypes : + `` balkan is violent . '', 
  there i list the major wars we 've been in for the past 1000 years - 6 of them , and most were defensive . 
  meanwhile , the rest of non-balkan europe had dozens of major wars , and then it exported them to literally the whole world in the form of colonization . 
  there i summarize the history or eu * and * yugoslavia . 
  they 're creepily similar up until the end . 
  ( eu has n't ended * yet * , so it remains to be seen how that will happen if it happens , and how europe looks afterwards . ), 
  i also point out that croatia at least was in some form of mini-eu since 1102 ( ! ) . 
  + `` balkan is a shithole . '', 
  yes , we 're less prosperous than western euros . 
  however , europe has a * first world problems * thing going on , so talking about balkan as if it 's closer to africa than nordics is unfair , [ here 's the hdi report for 2016 . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/2016_un_human_development_report.svg/921px-2016_un_human_development_report.svg.png ), 
  thanks for the link , will check it out in more detail later . 
  i skimmed the [ top comment ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/64i9f6/how_did_the_balkans_become_the_region_of_europe/dg2nxag/ ) , and it 's interesting enough . 
  but one thing i do n't quite agree with there : the amount of blame it puts on outsiders ( or at least i read it that way ) . 
  now obviously the outside world is always relevant , the notion of totally independent states is naive nonsense . 
  and imo the fall of the soviets , and communism in general , affected the situation a lot . 
  ( basically the neutral 3rd option only works if there are two sides - west and east - one can choose to be neutral from . 
  the money outsiders poured in here to keep us as a buffer zone certainly helped . ), 
  but . 
  claiming the outside interests ^ ^ tm broke apart yugoslavia when its coffin has been in the making ... ever since it came into existence ... [ is a bit like claiming putin elected trump into office .

  glad you like it !, 
   tbh in my case , i was 4 and half years old when the war started , so in one sense some of my very first memories are the sirens , but on the other hand i was too little to actually remember the war much , yugoslavia even less . 
  so to speak about `` how it was '' , i have to go by what the older people around me say , and dry historical summaries . 
  the tl ; dr is mostly a recap of the dry summaries , with some added flavor - for example , if you ask wikipedia , it may minimize how much the bad economy affected * everything * . 
   `` eu give potato , only potato '' ? 
  about that , here 's a maybe-relevant polandball :d http://i.imgur.com/ivhvqhv.png,
