  and in any case , even if you do n't know the stats , us euros have this impression of france as `` monday guillotine , wednesday general strike , friday napoleon invasion '' . 
  just comes across as ignorant tbh \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  yes , yes , but in the aftermath , they 'll have to do all the work they 're not doing right now . 
  in a fallout-case , the rich might get away alive somehow ... and they 'll be the equivalent of cast away . 
  as if money or gold have any value in a world where you survive by picking mutant berries . 
  that 's why i ca n't follow the `` logic '' of all those conspiracy scenarios where they ^ tm want to destroy the world that makes their lives awesome in the first place . 
   even though they 'll never allow us to join , and we 'll never accept their conditions for joining . 
  let 's not be hasty here . 
  if you lived in the 80 's and someone asked you whether the communist party will implode in the next 10-15 years , you 'd probably say no . 
  if you asked people in 2015 whether the uk will rage-quit the eu , they 'd most probably say no ( * everyone was surprised * ) . 
  politics change , and if eu will keep expanding - not now , but i 'm talking the next 10-20 years - they ca n't leave you ( or you and bosna ) as the only non-eu country left in europe . 
  ahh , deleted the post , was caught in a filter , see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/64ww89/a_strongly_worded_letter_to_the_western_europe/dg5u5vb/ ) . 
  just a side-note in regards to stereotypes being true ~ which ones ? 
  you mean the occasional idiot that zips through ? 
  the thing is , when i see idiots from here , i also tend to think `` balkanizam '' . 
  but when i see idiots from elsewhere , and dead lord they have some * seriously , hilariously stupid people * , i do n't `` think '' in a similar confirmation bias . 
  one main thing i do see from our folk , but this is n't part of the usual huehuehue-balkan , is the eternal whining . 
  ask anyone , either on the street or on internet , and it 'll turn out we all live in the democratic republic of congo . 
  that is a shithole . 
  and there are hundreds of [ shitholes between them and us .

  ahh ... there was a miscommunication with the mods . 
  the post was caught up in a filter , an hour or so passed , i mailed them with `` nevermind , i 'll try re-submitting later '' , then i went afk .

  so , sorry for being late ... deleting now . 
  maybe i 'll try again tomorrow . 
  * as for \u017di\u017eek , as i said i 'm not very familiar with him , philosophy is n't something i follow much ( arrogance would be one of the dozen reasons :p ) . 
  i just know some of his thoughts , and since he 's a professional philosopher , i assume his data/research/etc is at least better-sourced than some random bloggers ' :d, 
  ur killing the mood, 
  ** notes : ** + tl ; dr at the end . 
  it 's a short and funny video . 
  + i expect i might offend some people with this - the topic after all concerns a rather offensive stereotype . 
  i find that the quickest way to attack stereotypes about whatever group x , is to remark about the same thing z being present in group y , if it happens that group y thinks it 's somehow `` better '' than group x because it `` does n't do '' z. 
  + aaand with all that said , i 'm not writing a ponderous cultural-historical tome on geopolitics and the psychology of humanity , [ citation needed ] . 
  if you disagree for whatever reason ( up to memes included ) , if you have whatever other citation , discussion welcome !, 
  i 'm just writing a self-post based on my personal observations and whatever dusty history i remember . 
  ---------------------------------- ## [ welcome to the balkans ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1tj2zj2wvg ) * note 247 : i 'm mostly speaking from the perspective of the western balkans , my country in particular . 
  for obvious reasons . 
  have you ever heard of [ slavoj \u017di\u017eek ? 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavoj_%c5%bdi%c5%beek ) he 's a slovenian philosopher i 'm not all that familiar with , partially because philosophers put me to sleep . 
  i did encounter some of his thoughts on the divisions in europe in the last few months though , and i think he 's onto something at least when it comes to the `` dreaded balkan nobody wants to belong to '' . 
  or dreaded `` eastern europe '' , if you 're further up north . 
  both are * always * to the south/east of where the speaker happens to be standing , and that goes all the way to ukraine . 
  ( and in my experience , ukrainians will tell you that `` they 're not as bad as those russians '' . ), 
  the serious version of the un-serious video i linked in the tl ; dr is [ here . 
  ] ( https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jii/4750978.0006.202/--spectre-of-balkan?rgn=main;view=fulltext ) it becomes too philosophical for my taste by the middle , and while i think he makes some good points , he also neglected some . 
  ** stereotype no 1 . 
  ** ** `` those balkans are quarrelsome warlords . 
  '' ** yes , there was a war following the breakup of yugoslavia . 
  since the rest of the world hardly hears about balkans if it does n't concern some disaster - which is a good thing , mind you - it 's no surprise that outsiders sometimes ask whether they 'll be `` safe '' coming to the [ 26th most peaceful country in the world ( ! ) . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_peace_index#global_peace_index_rankings ) outside of this recent-ish war ( 22 years , that 's like , * yesterday * ) , off the top of my head , we had ... wwii and wwi , in which as the names imply , basically everyone was involved in . 
  ( except switzerland . ), 
  before that , we had venice trying to annex the coast , napoleon trying to annex all of europe , and ottomans trying to annex all of europe . 
  those were defensive wars , and obviously they were n't limited to balkans . 
  the rest of the time , we were usually in some version of a union with incarnations of austro-hungary/habsburgs/hungary alone , and if that empire has any unusual claim to fame , then it 's the fact that they mostly expanded by unions/marriages / * politicking * , instead of eternal war-anschluss . 
  ( you could say they fucked their way to the top ? ), 
  meanwhile , again off the top of my head , here 's what not-balkan europe had : + vikings + protestant-catholic wars + expanding and contracting empires , too many to count , you could say it was a `` regular weekly anschluss '' + france and uk having something that 's literally called the `` 100 year war '' + i 've been informed that denmark and sweden somehow managed to beat the france-uk record in the number of wars ( ?! ), 
  + france and germany had that thing where they `` have to be eternally hostile to each other '' + napoleon , cause he bears repeating + the roman empire + alexander + let 's not forget who the leaders of the world wars were , and what 's the difference between the * excuse * and the real * motivation * + russia annexing all of northern asia , big difference being that they managed to hold onto their colony + [ the rest of the world ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/sdctborftw0yhpxk9bwub_glt4jkqiwoyjfvddghny4.jpg?w=1024&s=6efd3f62fde90ac62c22792b49c4dd25 ) being colonized by a select few western euros + i 'm possibly forgetting up to a dozen big wars . 
  compared to all of that , we 're downright cuddly . 
  lazy , even . 
  low energy ... ? 
  ** ** `` those balkans are quarrelsome nationalists that ca n't cooperate on anything . 
  '' ** let 's back up a bit . 
  most of balkan has either joined the eu , or is trying to join it ( with more or less enthusiasm ) . 
  eu is in a crisis , everybody and their dog knows it . 
  the rough timeline : + separate we 're weak , we can either nod along to uncle sam or to mama rusija . 
  partially because a couple of wars leveled us . 
  let 's unite because united we 're stronk ( er ) and we can tell uncle sam and mama rusjia to fuck off , if need be ? 
  and since we 're precociously clever , we 'll be the mostly-neutral `` 3rd option '' . 
  + union grows , integrates . 
  some do n't like this increasing integration . 
  some want more of it . 
  the super-state is n't exactly what everyone hoped it 'd be . 
  + but , friendly outsiders are investing and trading , plus we 're no slouches in rebuilding and making more of a good thing . 
  important people ^ tm flatter us . 
  economy is prosperous . 
  + economy stagnates . 
  influential outsiders become erratic . 
  the richer west/north resents paying so much for the eternally lazy/incompetent east/south . 
  on the other hand , same east/south is saying it 's not that simple , west/north gains a lot with increased trade , brain drain , the blasted mutual currency , etc. 
  + crisis , economy tanks . 
  + parallel to all of that , concerns about sovereignty . 
  everybody feels pushed-around by some faceless bureaucrats from some distant capital they never connected with . 
  + intellectuals are trying to manufacture an overarching european identity , unity-peace-and-unicorns . 
  most people do n't feel it very strongly . 
  + issues with parliament representation , as well as who supplies a disproportionate number of bureaucrats . 
  unfunny veto-hijinks in the council . 
  + the geographically isolated but rich uk rage-quits , leaves after a referendum . 
  + shortly after that , france quits in a similar fashion . 
  + poland , which benefited a lot from the project , tries to annex most of france , and also rolls over germany in the process . 
  germany ends up having a 3-way with france and poland , for old times sake . 
  + uk stays unscathed cause it has a scary uncle sam and it 's an island , d'oh . 
  poland fails in annexing france , the unfunny 3-way in germany fails . 
  25 years later , germany has a moderate personality disorder . 
  i had you up until france quit , did n't i ? 
  this was n't the tl ; dr timeline of the eu ( and its possible break-up ) , but the timeline of ** yugoslavia ** , its breakup , and the subsequent wars that followed . 
  also it 's not a perfect analogy because what the uk , france and germany are to eu roughly translates to what slovenia and croatia were to yuga , plus in this case , poland should have the biggest army . 
  and keep in mind that france might quit anyways , remains to be seen what happens after the elections coming up soon . 
  another obvious difference is that it 's highly unlikely people will go to war to keep the eu from falling apart . 
  but what happens afterwards ?
