  remember that if/when people praise the eu , it 's because along with it , yurop had an unprecedented period of peace . 
  this is not our natural state . 
  and let me tell you ~ be you an eu-skeptic or defender , you probably have concerns about how the eu ( not ) functions nowadays . 
  the current eu problems are minor compared to the problems yugoslavia had for all of its existence ( and both incarnations ) , [ especially in the 80 's . 
  ] ( https://chnm.gmu.edu/1989/archive/fullsize/econ-module-yogu-gdp-chart-8_b2af6c1915.jpg ) greece was the worst hit by the eurozone crisis , and i have n't yet heard about them driving only every other day `` because gas shortages '' , or experiencing the concept of `` there being no product xyz on the shelves today '' . 
  yugoslavia also happened to be a communist * dictatorship * , so try being `` democratic and sovereign '' like that . 
  eu 's political importance also has n't been nullified by the fall of the soviet union . 
  and yet i hear people complaining about the eu every day . 
  that 's not to say that they have no cause to complain , but if eu 's flaws are concerning and * legitimate * , why is the story of yugoslavia falling apart `` dumb nationalism '' ? 
  remember we all may revert to aggression if the eu falls apart . 
  side-note : when it comes to uniting/cooperating with bigger powers for the sake of safety and prosperity , our first union with hungary was in ** 1102 .

  map comes out in the sub . 
  ** stereotype no 3 . 
  ** ** `` those balkans are a shithole . 
  '' ** seriously now , i think a lot of europe has a bit of a `` first world problems '' thing going on . 
  healthy competition is good , and of course you 'll look up instead of down when searching for inspiration . 
  and comparing most of europe to africa or middle east ( or a concerning percentage of planet earth ) just becomes depressing/useless . 
  but when it comes to balkans , you know what i 'm talking about , right ? 
  nowadays at least on the internet ( which is 99,9 % of my contact with outsiders ... ) you can just say `` do n't go to balkans , tis a silly place '' and * everybody knows * . 
  it 's that embarrassing uncle bob you like to hide when other cool kids visit . 
  \u017di\u017eek thinks it 's a form of racism , and that part of the reason for it ( aside from * projection * and feeling better about oneself by looking down ) is because balkans-amirite is just about the only remaining acceptable form of `` i 'm not judgemental , but ... '' left to the first-est world :  because balkan remains a part of europe and is inhabited by white people , racist clich\u00e9s that one would n't dare use in reference to some african or asian nation can be freely applied to balkan . 
  i 'm not so sold on that . 
  travel agencies were acting as if croatia popped into existence out of nowhere in early 2000 's , saying strange things like `` they have * surprisingly * lovely nature and rich history '' . 
  it 's like westerners equated all communism with bland commie blocks , or we were n't a `` lovely '' vacation spot since [ at least 305 ad ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/diocletian%27s_palace ) , or history started in the 20th century ? 
  i guess people thought communism = bumfuck nowhere , siberia ? 
  also memetic `` politburo took potato , only sadness '' . 
  and then the next thing they remember about balkans is the yugoslav war which was bad in itself ... but then it also made geography exams 7-countries-harder , which seems more irl-relevant to random strangers that have nothing to do with us . 
  ( myself , i fail at all those ussr - stan countries , * and how 's that for tone-deaf ? 
  * ) so it could be a form of normal ignorance everybody has when it comes to more distant/less politically or economically relevant parts of the world for whomever you are . 
  i ca n't exactly boast about my nuanced knowledge of south america/australia/most of asia/actually most countries in the world , including some in europe . 
  not sure what else could be the cause for westerners using balkanization as a dirty word , or acting like we 're much closer to [ the red countries instead of the dark green countries .

  -------------------------- ## [ tl ; dr. ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge4sxlgiaga ) ps . 
  but seriously , do n't break the eu , you wonderful sexy beasts !, 
  we are catholibans . 
  i still ca n't decide whether we made a mistake by going south from poland . 
  problem with europe is that geographically speaking , it 's a very large peninsula masquerading as a continent because `` culture '' . 
  and those `` hurr durr cultural differences '' are a more modern thing , it used to be that the mediterranean was the center of all things interesting ... old rome , and greece , and even ottomans plus all the other muslim/transcontinental empires did n't see some strong dividing line . 
  whole mena was very much relevant for europe and its development . 
  and then of course , russia annexed the whole northern asia and exported its way of doing things all the way to vladivostok , so - where do you draw this `` cultural '' line ? 
  religion ? 
  but pardon me , the various ugly wars between the christian factions tell me a different story . 
  and obviously islam itself is n't such a dividing line even today , bosniaks and albanians are undoubtedly european . 
  what , who was more `` civilized '' or , who was the enemy or something , some deus vult narrative ? 
  ehh , interesting side-note from history : the republic of ragusa ( dubrovnik ) sold a small strip of land to ottomans ... to protect itself from * venice * . 
  it worked , they kept their independence for centuries , up until napoleon , another fine `` european '' , put an end to that . 
  i guess it comes down to * choice * in the end . 
  turkey more or less chooses to be its own thing , not quite european and not quite middle eastern , but something special , separate from both ... same applies to russia in way . 
  georgia and armenia , on the other hand , choose - want to be - in our group . 
  so that 's that , i think . 
  they 're `` ehh '' i guess . 
  wo n't really cure you , more like give you the equivalent of a bandaid in terms of diagnosis and medication . 
  too few doctors , too little space and time , people do n't like going there ... but then again , people do n't like going to hospitals in general . 
  and psychiatry in general does n't quite `` cure '' many people . 
  for what it 's worth , they do help the cases i know . 
  as a side-note ~ the one in my city has only the ground floor . 
  that struck me as strange , all the other buildings in that hospital complex have a number of upper floors . 
  then i thought about it a bit and went like '' ... oh . 
  huh . 
  checked the wiki itself , it 's the same when i open it ( d'oh ) . 
  but ... 
  [ here . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/l0s5n1r.png ) hm , i thought those snippets that google turns up are from wiki . 
  since you kicked up a hornet 's nest , op , here 's two humorous recaps , what a slovenian stand-up philosopher slavoj \u017di\u017eek has to say about `` nobody wants to belong to balkan/eastern europe '' , and `` what 's the difference between central and eastern europe '' . 
  it works like a charm !, 
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwdrhqnz9lo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge4sxlgiaga, 
  i do n't think it matters what you or i think , but what the consensus is . 
  when i google `` croatia '' , first result that pops up is the wiki link with `` croatia is an eastern european country with a long coastline on the adriatic sea . '', 
  i mean , geography itself is dubious anyways , iirc some geographers put the center of europe in poland , some even in belarus . 
  and yet people everywhere will go `` lol wut ?? '', 
  if you tell them that some parts of those two are supposed to be `` western '' . 
  bloody hell we ca n't even decide what is and is n't europe in the first place , geographically the whole continent is part of eurasia . 
  so , it 's up to opinions , which are influenced by propaganda a lot of the time . 
  and the loudest voices in propaganda certainly are n't * ours * , we 're too small and weak for that . 
  tbh to us it is n't really relevant here , what outsiders think , * except * when they try to keep us `` in the region '' . 
  the region being western and central balkan , which is more backwards than we are , so obviously we have no interest in being politically or economically tied down to them . 
  it 'd be like ukraine being forced to stick with russia instead of eu . 
  we 're using latin script , we were with hungary and austria 1102-1918 , and we are and were so `` catholiban '' that the borders of the ottoman empire are basically our modern borders today . 
  ( yes , that 's how that bit of madness came to be . ), 
  zagreb is more west than stockholm . 
  * they still call us eastern europe * , with sometimes widening it to `` south-eastern europe '' , and there 's little we can do about that . 
  it 's complicated . 
  what i 've seen of right-wing ( moderate to extreme ) in west eu , it always seems to involve these two things : anti-immigrant rhetoric and some manner of eu-exit or at least eu-decentralization . 
  both are non-issues here , the only party that rants against eu are chemtrails-lunatics that only barely got into the parliament as a joke/protest vote , as for the movement of people , that is a problem in that we 're experiencing worrying brain drain . 
  not one of `` them '' plans to stay here . 
  for economy ... we basically do n't have a more-socialist left wing . 
  it 's capitalist pigdogs all the way down . 
  if anything , it 's ironically our right-wing that buys more votes/social peace with `` social bandaids '' . 
  typical sjw-type topics ? 
  ehhh . 
  keep in mind that we never colonized anyone so that 's `` white burden '' being a non-issue , for a start . 
  female rights ? 
  again , discussion seems less polarized and relevant than in west ( i give credit to commies and their `` everyone is a comrade '' mantra ) . 
  lgtb rights is an issue , but again , most people are way more concerned with getting a decent job than that , any kind of platform that rants for/against someone being `` privileged '' does n't work . 
  i think that 's called `` identity politics '' in the west . 
  as for minorities , biggest one we have is serbs , and that discussion is charged and complicated because of the war . 
  so , as a tl ; dr , i do n't think that the typical divisions on what 's supposed to be right and left wing applies much here . 
  we 've had very different paths from west eu and usa .
