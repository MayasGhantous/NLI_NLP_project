  we have 3 main dialects . 
  standard language is based on one , \u0160tokavski . 
  the other two , kajkavski & \u010cakavski have pretty much an equal amount of history , literature , regional stubbornness & etc behind them ... so trying to force these other two to `` speak standard '' would produce howling about murderous oppression or something . 
  plus , even the people who speak `` normal '' \u0160tokavski have their differences from standard language which is perceived sort of like ... pompous snobbery made up by dusty linguists . 
  they ai n't taking our `` real talk '' away from us !, 
  [ can we borrow your ideas , crazy explorer senpai ? 
  :3 ] ( https://thevieweast.wordpress.com/2009/05/16/communist-czechoslovakia-planned-construction-of-underground-tunnel/ ), 
  my opinion is that i do n't have a firm opinion - i do n't know much about the issue . 
  ca n't judge because i know i 'm missing facts . 
  is it about money ? 
  cultural and/or historical differences ? 
  mismanagement of these regions by the central government ? 
  all of the above ? 
  in general , i 'm not a complete fan of self-determination arguments , because they can lead to absurdity , whichever patch of land declaring independence the moment they feel displeased ... that 's chaos . 
  on the other hand , keeping people inside some country they do n't want to be in is no good either . 
  ideally both sides would agree to the secession , like the example of scotland where iirc london is obliged to let it happen if the scots vote to get out . 
  so , apparently spain - the central government , anyways - wo n't agree to let that happen , to no surprise ( which sane country wants to get weaker and smaller if they do n't have to ? ) . 
  i guess that then the referendum needs to have strong enough results ( 2/3 at least ) , plus it 'd help if there 's some legal loophole/historical background like what uk/usa/germany / switzerland/etc have with their parts . 
  gah , bosnia is a present-day problem cause their roads suck in comparison . 
  so not only do we have the stupidest country shape this side of chile , taking the shortcut from north-east to south-east is n't entirely smart . 
  and also , their neum is a legit problem . 
  we 're lucky in that eu will give most of the money for the bridge around it . 
  emigration has been a thing here during communism also ( we were n't behind the wall ) , and before communism . 
  basically , it started being a problem , uhhh , when steam ship tickets got cheap enough ? 
  something like half of us live outside croatia . 
  and getting into eu only made it worse simply because getting elsewhere is even easier now . 
  it 's not just the unemployed leaving , but employed also , people want bigger paychecks , and we wo n't get on germany 's level any time soon , even with minor miracles . 
  so ... we have too few doctors . 
  too few engineers . 
  and this is all young-ish people we educated with our tax money . 
  there is a silver lining , mind you . 
  even though we have many unemployed still , labor shortages are visible in many fields already , so now the employers have two options : import bosnians , or raise wages . 
  both are a good ( ish ) thing . 
  as for the aging population , and `` wait who 's gon na finance the retired people in 20-50 years ??!, 
  '' , that is a problem , but i think a greater problem is automatization that 's been killing jobs for a while now - and will continue to do so . 
  so i feel like our current model of jobs/retirements/whole economy will have to change anyways , with or without the demographic crunch . 
  uh ... the other half of the country . 
  no , seriously . 
  there 's more than just the coast to croatia ( in the lower , diagonal part of the `` v '' shape ) . 
  and the plus is that the continental part is n't overrun by tourists , which tends to make tourists complain ... about themselves ( ??! ) . 
  now , i guess people are n't as interested in the continental part because it 's `` samey-same '' when compared to hungary , austria , czech republic ( it 's like we shared a country for 800 years or something !, 
  ) , but that complaint is also kinda odd - the coast is samey-same when compared to italy . 
  i guess it 's the lack of promotion ... or the lack of sea , poor sun-deficient northerners just want a tan during vacation . 
  anyways , some exhibits : + [ vukovar ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/vukovar_turm.jpg ) with its lingering war-damage and [ memorials ] ( https://s3.amazonaws.com/gs-geo-images/7fb78956-1f1f-4382-8067-5825dfce4f12_l.jpg ) ( there 's where the `` but i thought balkan is war-like ! '', 
  is ) + [ kopa\u010dki rit ] ( http://www.tzosbarzup.hr/userfiles/image/gallery/baranja-aerial-0049-kopacki-rit.jpg ) nature park + [ osijek ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0a/50/d6/0a50d6210c7e16fffc4ab6d4b3a83cb9.jpg ) + [ \u0110akovo ] ( http://www.pecsma.hu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/dakovo.jpg ) + its stud farm + [ vara\u017edin ] ( http://blog.uniline.hr/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/varazdin-panorama.jpg ) + [ trako\u0161\u0107an ] ( http://www.seoski-turizam.hr/resources/files/images/venues/galleries/52/144/trakoscan2_800x600.jpg ) + then there 's zagreb . 
  imo zagreb is more interesting than any of the coastal cities/places ... obviously , it 's much bigger , there 's more to do and see . 
  like for example the [ advent .

  to hell with all their fish and olive oil , eat [ \u010dobanac .

  are we properly friendly even now ? 
  with our competing interests ? 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  eu functions enough so far , because we have enough common interests and benefits of cooperation . 
  but even with those , just in today 's threads you have the divisions between nord stream ii and the three seas initiative . 
  there 's that old saying - `` nations have no permanent friends or allies , they only have permanent interests . '' so let 's say the whole structure that 's keeping us civilized enough breaks apart . 
  what 's stopping any and all of us from pursuing our specific , competing interests ? 
  mutual benefit ? 
  * but we just broke the eu * , which was the best structure for the insurance of said mutual benefits . 
  in this disturbing what-if scenario , apparently we or our politicians or both decided that neither the increased economy nor the increased safety/peace that the eu brings are relevant anymore . 
  so , it 's `` every man for himself '' then . 
  all of us being small fish - yes , even germany and france - means we 're easy pickings for bigger/more belligerent powers . 
  i can only hope that my country in that case gets to be usa 's yes-man , instead of china 's or russia 's , or bloody hell , turkey and saudis have been sniffing around bosnia lately . 
  and that 's before the immigrant crisis gets into full swing . 
  these last few years , that was * nothing * . 
  assuming that humanity does n't figure out a technological way to deal with global warming ... we 're heading into another great migration period , i think . 
  only , if i 'm still alive at that point , i 'll probably join the wave that starts in africa and tries to get north . 
  this last week , for the first time ever , forest fires reached the outskirts of split , our 2nd biggest city . 
  meh , so many of our debts - both public and private - are already in euro . 
  before euro , it was deutsche mark . 
  so any theoretical sovereignty we have over our kuna is just another sad delusion , kuna has n't been independent since its inception . 
  devaluing it for the sake of exports or whatever would just make our debts go boom , so that 's not happening - period . 
  all the `` difference '' we get is just the name of the currency . 
  meanwhile , switching to euro would make travel and tourism easier , so ... we lose nothing , only potentially gain something . 
  i think you misunderstand . 
  this conversation started with `` every summer there 's a few '' , to which you responded with that being an understatement . 
  `` there 's a few '' according to what most people remember ... according to what is news-worthy . 
  tiny localized fires happening in dalmatia has n't been news for probably a thousand years now , it 's about as remarkable as `` hail falling in the north for a few minutes '' . 
  * this latest wildfire * is certainly news-worthy and it will be remembered within the sentence of `` every summer , a few wildfires '' . 
  well i guess it depends on how we count . 
  `` so a hill burned down '' is n't exactly news-worthy . 
  we need a few hills and/or houses threatened to properly remember it , otherwise it 's somewhere in the ranks of `` crazy czech tried to climb biokovo in flipflops '' . 
  this one is co-owned with hungarians , but anyways - [ the siege of szigetv\u00e1r ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/siege_of_szigetv%c3%a1r ) . 
  because : + defenders : 2300 -- 3000 . 
  attackers : 100 000 -- 300 000 . 
  + casualties : everyone on the defending side , the last 600 in the final charge . 
  20 000 -- 30 000 on the attacking side . 
  then suleiman died in his tent of old age while it was happening , ottomans went back constantinople to get a new sultan , and basically vienna was n't threatened again for more than a 100 years . 
  zrinski was a general badass , too . 
  i think some hollywood editing ( throw in a romance there or at least a lot of manly bonding ) could make it a new this is sparta . 
  boring answer , but what can i do , imo it 's definitely the most beautiful : [ plitvice lakes national park . 
  ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=plitvice+lakes&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewiz6p7m7k7uahulg5okhtxrawqq_auicigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818&amp;dpr=1.13 ), 
  to tell bih and serbia apart : remember that bosniaks are muslims . 
  our idiotic country-shape is like that because those were the old military borders against ottomas . 
  so that 's why it looks like we 're trying to eat bosnia . 
  aside from the obvious people listed ( switzerland etc ) ... turkey ? 
  people , we are n't getting constantinople back . 
  it 's gone .
