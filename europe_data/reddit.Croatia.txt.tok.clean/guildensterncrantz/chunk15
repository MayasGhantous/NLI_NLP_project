  ok , can someone eli5 what the deal with soros is ? 
  why is he `` responsible for every conspiracy '' ever ? 
  i ca n't find any straight answers , googling just gives me stuff that 's visibly crackpot tinfoil . 
  what do you think is most likely to happen ? 
  if the eu project soldiers on ( pretty likely , i think ) , and bih continues as it is , it 'll end up being a hopelessly poor country surrounded by eu . 
  hell i read somewhere that half of bih already moved out to greener pastures , there 's only so long this can continue . 
  the notion of war is silly , neither croatia nor serbia can afford it ( nor want it , as far as i can tell ) , nato and eu do n't want it , russia is too far away and what would be their gain , anyways ? 
  peaceful anschluss is dubious too , first the 2/3 sides in bih would have to agree to it , then - how would you even do it ? 
  the borders would look ludicrous if we go by ethnicity , and you 'd still be left with a bosnian side somewhere in the middle/scattered about , also tbh ... we have enough problems all on our own , without trying to incorporate the herzegovian economy . 
  it all looks like romania and moldova to me . _ . 
  what are the odds that the 3-government system quits ? 
  fun fact back at you : something similar happened here in the end , too . 
  iirc there was some whining about the walk of shame segment ( nekkid woman , church , omg !, 
  ) , then got started filming for dorne in spain at the same time because * alc\u00e1zar * , i heard there was also some extra bureaucratic tape , so they ended up moving the rest of the king 's landing & co production to spain . 
  i mean to be fair they do n't need that many sunny exteriors nowadays , but still  . <, 
  + cradle of western civilization/thought , socrates , plato , aristotle , pythagoras , diogenes :d + also their ancient drama has more murder , incest , plots and schemes than a regular game of thrones season . 
  + iirc the romans straight up copied most of their philosophy/art/architecture / etc and just renamed it like a modern day `` abibas '' . 
  + while the coast is pretty and the acropolis is definitely worth visiting , [ do n't forget the interior . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60hwid/meteoragreece/ ) seriously , i 'm convinced that meteora is one of the most metal places on earth !, 
  + gyros , not kebab !, 
  + through a weird chain of events , i ended up in a high school where we learned ancient greek . 
  our `` knowledge '' basically boiled down to knowing how to read the alphabet and nothing else . 
  most of our teachers did n't have this all-important skill . 
  then , in our school , every class had a permanent classroom for itself . 
  this meant that we had plenty of time to write out history/chemistry/art / math/whetever cheat sheets on our blackboard , in plain sight , before any test :d ** \u0391\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ce \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1 !, 
  i was just trying to find a genetic study of modern macedonians , all that stuff about haplogroups etc ( i do n't even really know what it means , i just see geneticists using it a lot ) . 
  [ have a cute map here , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/jvc2opu.jpg ) but no macedonia on it , and even saying `` well they should be similar to serbs/greeks/bulgarians '' would trigger some people . 
  and so my cunning plan ^ ^ 1 to prove that macedonians have some `` genetic right '' to alexander was foiled !, 
  something similar here . 
  obviously the list reads like an advert for men who 'd like to go back to the `` good old days '' , but even these `` old days '' are something you 'll sooner find in a typical western country ( fantasy ) in the first half of 20th century , instead of here . 
  `` they do n't whine or get clingy , and they never hold a grudge '' - knowing my grandmas and their stories , it 's true that there was n't much * whining * , more like twisting his ear off whenever he 'd get some stupid ideas , including what 's the `` proper '' place for men and women . 
  the proper place was : hard labor , for both of them , ai n't nobody got no time for ego-pandering when there 's food to be grown . 
   come on , do something * pokes with a stick * come on !, 
  will you stop poking people with stick ? 
  here 's / r/subredditdrama for your popcorn needs !, 
  huh . 
  i remember it was the sort of room you do n't actually get access to , you can just see the skulls through the little window-like openings in the door , and it was n't even a part of the official tour . 
  goes like , one hungover person sees , blinks a bit , calls others with `` am i seeing things ? '', 
  and so on . 
  we figured it was some part of the orthodox burial ritual or something , just for the priests that hang around there . 
  til it applies to greece in general , which is ... `` why did n't i google this '' and `` yeah kinda creepy , but also cool ! '', 
  at least here , the - sko , or to be more correct in this case , - ko goes for adjectives . 
  \u010ce\u0161ko = czech ( something ) , \u010cesi = the czechs ( people ) , \u010ce\u0161ka = czechia/czech republic ( we always called it \u010ce\u0161ka , regardless of the republic-whatever 's ) . 
  oh yeah , i was generally more impressed with the interior ... maybe because a pretty coast does n't mean that much to me :d mycenae was super-interesting , partially because of how * old * it looks even from a distance . 
  plus seeing an irl place that 's kinda connected to the greek myths/dramas we had to learn in school was neat , sort of like going to an irl rivendell would be . 
  [ and the epidaurus theater ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/epidaurus_theater_03.jpg ) ... we did a little test there . 
  some of us sat on top of the steps , others went to the bottom - the flat area in the middle ( arena , iirc ) . 
  they sang for a bit , at normal speaking volume , and we could hear them * perfectly * at the top , as if they were singing right next to us . 
  perfect acoustics , to the point of creepiness . 
  oh , people always talk about the greek coast or parthenon & co , and while those are definitely worth seeing , imo meteora wins by far . 
  1st or 2nd most surreal place i 've ever been to , [ looks like something that `` fell from mars '' ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0vz1mni.jpg ) from kalabaka beneath it . 
  ( side-note : the hotel manager who put a pool with a perfect view on the roof is * genius * . ), 
  seeing one monastery from the other , and the valley between - so cool . 
  and there was this one room full of skulls , for some reason . 
  also note : there 's only so far the bus/car can take you , you 'll be doing lots of climbing . 
  try not to be hungover from the night before :o, 
  yes , well , we mostly blame you for having the [ most hilarious borders this side of chile !, 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/60hilf/kaiserthum_oesterreich_austrian_empire_ca_1815/ ) getting to the coast from the north-east is so annoying , either have to drive though bosnia or take the long way around : < but seriously now , i do n't think it 's so much hate here ( ottomans were a 100 years and 3 major wars ago ) , but - concern , which i guess may end up being hate , depending on what happens now . 
  because erdogan and all that . 
  it 's weird , yeah . 
  never heard of a `` yugo-slavonia '' , slavonia is a region of croatia , and there was a [ kingdom of croatia-slavonia ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kingdom_of_croatia-slavonia ) , but it was a part of austria-hungary . 
  then in 1918 , the dissolution went : czechoslovak independence 28 october 1918 ( on map ) -  state of slovenes , croats and serbs independence 29 october 1918 ( [ not properly on map ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/state_of_slovenes%2c_croats_and_serbs_blank_map.svg/375px-state_of_slovenes%2c_croats_and_serbs_blank_map.svg.png ) ) -  vojvodina lost to serbia 25 november 1918 ( not on map ) -  dissolution 11 november 1918 ( not on map cause then austria-hungary should n't be here at all ) . 
  ah , i pulled out just the european countries , cause otherwise my comment would be even more unwieldy - 155 countries on the list . 
  anyways , in the link op provided , you have extra links at the bottom for download . 
  this is from `` online data/chapter 2 '' , in the excel it 's `` figure 2.2 whr 2017 '' . 
  for the non-yurop countries that are around the top , it 's canada 7 , new zealand 8 , australia 10 , israel 11 , costa rica 12 , usa 14 , chile 20 . 
  the lack of perspective i suppose , as i implied . 
  as / u/mil _ cord points out , it goes `` where do you think you are between the best and worst possible life for you ? '', 
  people here do n't often think about africa/middle east aside from `` death , destruction , hunger '' etc , while for example ukraine will probably spend a lot of time looking at russia , the rest of europe etc. 
  but it still becomes a bit odd sometime after the 50th mark . 
  for example libya is at 68 , and they 're a mess . 
  they 're also sort-of closer to europe in terms of culture ( who they 'll compare themselves to ) , and they do have ways to get news about the better parts of the world - this is n't like the 50 's where tinpot dictators could easily sell the narrative of `` we 're doing great , really '' . 
  so from 156 countries , ending with central african republic , here 's glorious yurop : 1 \\ . 
  norway 2 \\ . 
  iceland 4 \\ . 
  switzerland 5 \\ . 
  finland 6 \\ . 
  netherlands 9 \\ . 
  sweden 13 \\ .
