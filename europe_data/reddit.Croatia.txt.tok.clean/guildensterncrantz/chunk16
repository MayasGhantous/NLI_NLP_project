  ukraine side-note : ex-yuga , seriously ? 
  you 're more miserable than * moldova * ?? 
  i know that complaining a lot is a national pastime here , but some perspective would be nice . _ . 
  also estonia , hungary , portugal etc. 
  i can see greece being miserable because of `` pay denbts ! '', 
  and ukraine because of their `` oppressed russian minorities '' , but what gives ? 
  portugal is apparently sadder than venezuela . 
  the article does n't actually say `` how '' europe can do that , aside from  europeans love to complain about donald trump and the collapse of the liberal order , but have done very little to support the struggle for turkish democracy right next door . 
  it is not too late to deter erdogan from his path -- and europe has enough economic leverage and political clout to do so . 
  trying to nicely ask does n't work . 
  support the struggle for democracy , how exactly ? 
  somehow magic the imprisoned journalists and kurdish leaders into freedom ? 
  or cut off the economic ties ? 
  that does n't necessarily work , or at least it may not work very fast . 
  erdogan and his lot can just use that as more fuel for propaganda ( this can last for years ) , or maybe even find other economic partners who do n't care about our european values that much . 
   people are not religious , do n't believe in god , but many believe in `` some '' higher life force or spirits but is n't that just different wording for `` god '' ? 
  apparently this study just asked `` do you believe in god ? '', 
  i think that 's a too vague question . 
  if you asked me whether i believe in a personal jesus who died for my sins , and all that dogma , i 'd say no . 
  but if you asked if i believe in higher force/actually a very drunken trolling programmer who set the natural laws of this world and may be hiding in one of the 13 ( ?!? ), 
  space dimensions , i 'd say `` uuh , probably ? '', 
  which basically translates to just a different * form * of god . 
  what about the more `` unofficial '' rules ? 
  for example , over here you could theoretically be religious . 
  but in practice , once my grandfather wanted to get a job as a high school teacher , well he had to baptize his sons in secret because `` good little comrades are atheist . '', 
  if he had gotten dismissed , of course religion would n't be written up as the * official * reason . 
  right , but i think the approach from the article is pretty wrong . 
  building up a capable army is one of the easier things , at least in comparison to building up something more complex like industry/finance/schooling system . 
  and for context , * every 5th person living in the world today is chinese . 
  * if push came to shove , i think the `` smaller '' countries - except for usa - would be unpleasantly surprised by china 's ability to wage war . 
  ( they have nukes too , should it come to worst . ), 
  and as for soft power ... uhhh . 
  is uk ahead of china because of the commonwealth ? 
  not sure how much that one counts . 
  meanwhile uk 's relations to their own close neighbors and trading partners - eu - are pretty messy at the moment . 
  afaik their closest ally right now is usa lead by the likes of donald trump . 
  and when i look at my house , seemingly half of it is `` made in china '' . 
  that looks like more legit soft power if you ask me ... 
  ok , not eu . 
  but the idea of * any * separate european country being more powerful than china seems ridiculous . 
  iirc it worked when macedonia/serbia closed borders ( at least , the balkan flow was stemmed even before the agreement with turkey ) . 
  but i do n't know if it 's even possible to guard greece , too many islands too close to turkey - what are they going to do , sink their boats ? 
  mind you just letting them know that greece is as far as they 're going to get might do most of the job . 
  do n't you old nan me !, 
  but seriously now , at least theoretically we have to join ... eventually ... by the time asoiaf books are finished ? 
  tbh we do n't even care all that much , for one thing we 'd have to secure our hilariously shaped borders better . 
  but is n't everyone but ireland obliged to join eventually ? 
  and ireland just got the opt-out because of uk ( they 'll probably keep it ) . 
  mind you schengen can be delayed a lot ... but not indefinitely , at least in theory . 
  in case you were wondering , it 's [ zagreb cathedral ] ( http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-usyperjyrag/uuamracbqhi/aaaaaaaacec/rtgwatbfxue/s1600/704px-zagreb_cathedral_areal_1.jpg ) at 105 m. ( it has `` bandages '' on it because they 've been restoring it as far as i can remember visiting . ), 
  side-note : so now i got curious about the height of st. vitus cathedral in prague , my impression of it was `` whoah '' , so i thought it 'd be much taller . 
  it is n't , shorter by 8 meters . 
  to be fair , it just ... 
  [ looms .

  to be fair , those 3 sadly have something in common : nobody gives a toss about them . 
  too eastern , too poor , too whatever . 
  not in nato , not in eu , no prospects of joining any time soon . 
  there 's only so far russia could go in terms of open aggression in europe - they do n't have the men or the money to fund an army that 'd be necessary to go even as far as poland/germany . 
  ( hilariously , at lot of their economy is dependent on europe . ), 
  i could see them taking a bite out of the 3 baltics , but i seriously think that eu would intervene in that case . 
  and while eu may not be armed to the teeth at the moment , believe me when i say it does n't take very long - a year or two - to double or triple the size of your army , if you 're determined to do it . 
  i 'm talking about the beginning of the war , meaning 91/92 . 
  we had very little - next to nothing - at the time , hell our * regular police * made up a significant part of the `` army '' . 
  within the next year or so , we got plenty of these smuggled weapons , also we straight up [ stole a lot of stuff from the jna bases scattered around , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/battle_of_the_barracks ) and then we basically turned into a war-economy in the next few years . 
  that does n't change the fact that the initial loses of around 1/3 of the croatian territory would n't have been as bad if we were n't almost defenseless in the beginning . 
  and as for bosnia , that was a bit later in the timeline ( 92 -  95 ) , by that time we sort-of had a functional army . 
  plus , over there everyone fought everyone at different periods ( part of the reason why their war was a much uglier ) , the `` difference '' is that bosniaks and croats mostly fought together against serbs in the beginning and end . 
  which is a lame difference , as far as these things go . 
  could be true , for all i know . 
  ( i do n't know . ), 
  but in that case , it does n't apply to us , we 're mostly kebab-free ( in fact we were usually the traditional euro condom against kebab . _ . ) . 
  if you ask the folks on the street here , the impression is that despite paying lip service to peace and democracy and all that , un/west did n't want yugoslavia to break up , so this embargo was an easy way for them to `` sadly wring their hands , omg there was a short ugly war , who could have guessed , what can you do '' . 
  so it 's a good thing that some countries like germany and hungary ignored that in practice and sent weapons to us anyways . 
  well , them or their smugglers , it 's hard to tell how much the officials turn a blind eye to such things , plausible deniability etc. 
  eh , these [ clinton tapes ] ( https://www.amazon.com/clinton-tapes-wrestling-history-president-ebook/dp/b002poeqtk ) have been around for a while . 
  you can question their validity of course , but [ what op submitted is in there . 
  ] ( http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/books/excerpt-clinton-tapes.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 ) and when it comes to the weapons embargo , it 's a fact that the west/un put it in place despite knowing full well that such an embargo left jna as the only prepared/functional army in ex-yugoslavia in the early 90 's , the same jna that turned into a de facto serbian army . 
  why they did that is a matter of debate . 
  also maybe australia , i heard they have a bit of a climate change deniers infestation going on . 
  i suspect it 's more `` full psychopath '' than full retard . 
  because fuck what the environment looks like in 100 years , they wo n't be alive at that time , and there 's oily money to be made now . 
  i just hope that it ends up being not-that-relevant . 
  iirc china is * bigly * investing into green energy ( because they 're choking already , d'oh ) , similar goes for europe , hopefully similar will go for india and other growing giants . 
  worst are the periods 7-8 , 12-14 , and 18-20 hours , those ferry all the high school kids . 
  sometimes i actually wait for the next one to arrive if i 'm not in a hurry , anything is better than ... feeling all that `` i ca n't even '' wafting in my direction . 
  is n't a big part of that the developing `` 3rd world '' ? 
  as in , i read somewhere that the number of people below poverty line dropped by 50 % , or 2 billion to 1 billion , within the twenty years of 1990-2010 . 
  and iirc most of that population below the line ( and many that are/were close to it ) was n't from europe . 
  so in a sense , it 's harder to raise your gdp if it 's already pretty high , than it is to improve from rock bottom . 
  a while back i browsed some of the archived top posts on this sub , plus stuff that concerns my region . 
  and the ones from 2 years ago , it 's not uncommon to see someone with an uk flag acting like , well , a part of the eu . 
  like for example when we joined up . 
  nowadays you have a lot of anger/shame/saltiness from `` both sides '' of the channel and remain/leave factions . 
  makes all those old posts look even sadder : <,
