  those also tend to have the occasional `` u '' and random dicks around them . 
  but what bugs me out more is the many `` pero + marica 29.07.2014 '' and similar . 
  i 'd like an update on the situation more often , you know ? 
  as in , are they still together ? 
  or broken up ? 
  and why ? 
  i ca n't handle the suspense !, 
  in that regard , [ this one wins . 
  ] ( http://opusteno.rs/slike/2016/12/smesne-slike-31947/dzabe-si-krecio-jos-je-volim.jpg ) = `` you whitewashed in vain / i still love her '', 
  but how would you research that ? 
  i 'm no biologist/psychologist here , so just going off what i `` know '' from common knowledge ... stuff like diet , genetic diseases etc , well it 's not * that * hard to isolate in some study , right ? 
  for comparison , take what we know of heart conditions and what we know/understand in regards to the human brain . 
  that example of black americans being more prone to heart conditions comes across as something that 's not * that * affected by the more psychological side of the equation . 
  when it comes to the intelligence side of the story , studies show that different - better - diet , education , even emotional health in childhood have great impact ( hell just look how the world iq improved in the last 100 or so years ) . 
  and we all heard about examples of identical twins raised in different conditions who end up having very different `` ways of thinking '' . 
  i do n't know how you 'd find legit differences in different populations without doing a lot of controlling for conditions . 
  huh . 
  odd to think of our clay as being quake-prone , even though dubrovnik was basically leveled in 1667 . 
  i guess it 's just because our earthquakes are comparatively rare and not that devastating , at least when you compare to the pacific ring of fire , or the bigger problems we have with floods and forest fires . 
  man , why did that fall out of fashion ? 
  i could think of a few situations where that would come in handy ... 
  and people talk as if a really determined/organized terrorist would be stopped by border guards . 
  plot twist : smuggling ( of just about anything ) is old as dirt , and in worst case you can just pass around the official border checkpoint , plenty of easy terrain here . 
  hm , i guess it depends on what kind of tourist you are . 
  over here , we have something like a split ~ there are those that go to the coast ( or skiing in winter ) for the sake of * vacation * , which basically consists of lying around on some beach , perhaps thinking deep philosophical thoughts . 
  most of the time we just go to our own coast for that ( and slovenia/italy for skiing ) . 
  then there 's * tourism * , as in visiting countries for the sake of the landscape , food , history etc. 
  this is basically `` all other countries '' - nobody is going to hand over a lot of money to go to greece for the sake of their beaches - we have our own , and the point is seeing parthenon/meteora etc. 
  so in that sense , serbia has plenty to offer imo . 
  dat 80 's hair ;d ( i mercilessly mock my parents , aunts and uncles for that . ), 
  i recently looked up our tourism stats ... for 2016 , more than 2 million german arrivals . 
  while that 's not a lot of them - they have 80 million people iirc - it 's still 1 of them for every 2 of us o.o so i guess that deutsch is becoming something of a necessity on the coast . 
  also , our colloquial word for ex-pat is basically `` gastarbajter '' . 
  germoney make good money , build nice house , buy mercedes to show off when visiting family , yes ? 
  ooooh ... tl ; dr : i do n't know/it 's complicated . 
  as / u/jtalin & co point out , most of the people here believe more in faceless eu bureaucrats than our kangaroo politicians . 
  ( to be fair , that 's because we basically do n't believe in our lot at all , and we 're skeptical of the goodwill in politics in general . 
  the eu lot is more competent though , so if they 'll be megalomaniacal psychopaths with delusions of grandeur , at least they 'll invest in the economy & stuff better , because in return that means more money for them . ), 
  when it comes to the army example , that one has an additional layer of complexity . 
  i think most of the younger people here would n't care if they 're protected by our army or the french/german one , same for people who are n't very nationalistic in general . 
  however , our middle-aged folks remember the yugoslav wars very well , and the veterans have a lot of influence/they 're very capable of stirring up trouble . 
  and the yna was an army that was * supposed to * protect everyone , but then when the war started it turned into a de facto serbian army . 
  so the notion of us giving up our * theoretical * sovereignty in that example will go down like a lead balloon . 
  ( i say theoretical because usa is the army that matters , and ours is a shadow of it 's mid-90 's self anyways . ), 
  gdp issues ... well , how would it work ? 
  we 're already supposed to give 2 % to nato ( we do n't ) , would another 2 % go to eu army ? 
  but in general , the best thing that can be done in that regard is our gdp growing . 
  which is a whole another set of issues - if i were you , i 'd keep pouring the money in south/east europe , but i 'd also make increased demands on the same countries getting rid of all the useless bureaucrat cronies - professional paper-pushers . 
  my impression is that at least 15 % of our gdp goes into feeding that lot . 
  make the public sector efficiency your first demand for `` big boys club '' :d mind you , the last option is that you do n't have the same requirements for all the countries , for example us europoors can get by with 1 % of gdp . 
  but in that case , you 're the ones that hardly get anything from the deal . _ . 
  let 's leave white papers alone and be practical for a moment . 
  for example , you get a law/agreement where you need to give 2-3 % of your gdp into the eu army . 
  germany and france can spare that , we ca n't . 
  we 're therefore not obeying the `` law '' and we 're out . 
  or let 's say one of the requirements for whatever concerns the efficiency of the judicial system . 
  have you looked at ours lately ? 
  sanader 's been at trial for , what , 6 ? 
  7 years now ? 
  and something like that will take years and years to improve , and while we 're doing that , the `` higher-speed '' eu moves further along into integration , which means they probably get richer , while we 're down in the hole - meaning the gap only widens . 
  i do n't know . 
  i mean , i guess it 's possible that these richer countries are proposing this with good intentions , and all that will be required is the will alone ? 
  because politicians are bleeding hearts ? 
  stranger things have happened , i guess . 
  edit : maybe this is just pessimism talking . 
  we 've tried to get into unions with different bigger powers ... how many times now ? 
  6th time 's the charm ? 
  [ tl ; dr  ( http://www.ecfr.eu/page/-/ecfr206_the_future_shape_of_europe_-_countrymap.jpg?v=1489486317 ) + the west/the rich are sick and tired of not getting anywhere . 
  too many countries , too many opinions ( see for example the eurozone problems , the refugee crisis clusterfuck etc ) . 
  + so they want to integrate further without those that drag their feet . 
  + but they kinda differ on what integrating further would mean . 
  + uk is out , poland and hungary are complicated . 
  they 'd integrate on some stuff ( like poland and eu army for obvious reasons ) , but they want more power to national governments . 
  + most of the countries are concerned that this `` several speeds europe '' would mean a slow shattering of the european * union * - stronger countries dominating unfairly , countries eventually rage-quitting . 
  + some of the `` swing states '' are skeptical because they think they 'll be left behind by default cause they 're poorer or smaller ( portugal honorary slav again ! ) . 
  others like denmark like the opt-outs they got by referendum . 
  side-note : anyone here reminded of yugoslavia ? 
  the richer west/north tired of being dragged down by the poorer east/south , central government trying to increase its powers , national powers resisting fang and nail , waaaay too many different interests and opinions , some vague notion of brotherhood that most people are n't buying into ? 
  but that 's the thing , when i saw this thread i thought it 'll just be a fun one , maybe with some teasing and the occasional salty redditor . 
  i mean we had map threads of `` which country jokes about which '' and they worked well , despite how ridiculous the topic is and how error-prone the `` data collecting '' for that must have been . 
  instead we have this bitch-fest because op used wikipedia , instead of some other dozen sources , all of which disagree with each other , probably because height-differences by nation is a vague/error-prone topic . 
  but that works for all of dinaric alps ? 
  at least as far as those records go . 
  i guess you can doubt such records in general , but op did say he used wikipedia with its possibly dubious sources . 
  imho such studies in general are often dubious \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  huh , you were n't kidding . 
  average for europe is 177,6 cm , the rest is usually below that . 
  we take the top 18 spots , then it 's new zealand . 
  as far as i can tell he 's this sub 's outrageously murican mascot . 
  i see a lot of nobly sacrificed karma in old threads ... :'), 
  and this is after all that razor wire . 
  getting some seriously mixed signals here ... 
   the swirling crises have stoked fears in brussels that the institutional crises could descend into ethnic conflict and a geopolitical confrontation , 16 years after the yugoslav wars ended . 
  what would they fight with , * strongly worded letters * and [ rusty mig 's ? 
  ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b0/15/10/b015100ed893704bacdbeacb28fd2391.jpg ) all the ex-yu armies are in tatters , and most of the folks here are `` trying into eu '' anyways . 
  the whole area is surrounded by nato . 
  putin is n't annexing anything because to do that , he needs to go through romania and bulgaria first ( sorry guys ! ) . 
  the whole area is also barely worth it in terms of internal resources ( time to be thankful that we have little to no oil and similar ) . 
  croatian and serbian `` crisis '' has fallen on the level of playing hot potato with the refugees and whatever our embarrassing politicians think is `` a witty comeback '' .
