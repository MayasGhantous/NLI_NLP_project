  this is politicking and russia trying to look like a big brother , but the worst that can happen is putin gets an economic/political foothold - if he feels like investing , which i somehow doubt . 
  mind you , the article is right in that the slowdown in eu expansion is slowly starting to have the same effect it had on turkey . 
  [ long context for us here ~ ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5ztfpv/who_pays_the_most_into_the_eu_and_who_gets_the/df126tm/?context=3 ), 
  so our situation is a bit complicated . 
  this is data for 2014 . 
  [ source here , in croatian . 
  so you have these `` periods '' . 
  one of them was 2007-2013 . 
  we only got into the club in the 2nd half of 2013 , and we got a budget of around 1 bn $ for that . 
  because of the n +3 rule , meaning you can draw out the money for 3 years afterwards - in this case , until 2016 - it was more important to draw this first billion out . 
  apparently we managed to use 84,5 % ( 972 million ) , which is `` above eu average '' . 
  so the following period is 2014-2020 , with n +3 until 2023 . 
  we get 10,67 bn $ for that . 
  we 're lame with that so far , at 12 % so far , below the eu average of 28 % . 
  ( [ other source agrees . 
  ] ( https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/countries/hr ) ) the lady says that 's not unexpected because of the effort to draw out the earlier money , but that we should also * hurry up and take euromonies , too many bureaucrats , too many requirements for small firms , bla bla * . 
  extra reason to hurry up and take the monies/make plans is because eu will be figuring out the plan for after-2020 this year . 
  [ yet another source ] ( http://www.poslovni.hr/eu-fondovi/hrvatska-od-2013-iz-fondova-eu-povukla-19-novca-322712 ) : in 2014 we got 584 million , in 2015 556 , in 2016 - 850 million . 
  ok ... we 're `` hurrying up slowly . '', 
  oh , looks like we 'll be finally building the pelje\u0161ac bridge , mostly with euromonies ( i heard it 'll be around 85 % of it ) . 
  context : bosnia has that little panhandle on the adriatic coast ( they can into coast !, 
  ) , it splits off the dubrovnik-neretva area from croatia proper , which is plenty inconvenient for transport , tourism ... and the fact that we 're supposed to join schengen one day . 
  my impression is that they `` made plans '' to build the damned thing every 4 years , the foundation stone must have been set a half-dozen times by now . 
  [ relevant polandball ( first 5 panels , anyways ) . 
  aah , you 're right , looked at it closer now . 
  yeah , it 's off , by the website spain should be contributing ... around 10,5 instead of 11,1 bn . 
  do n't know how the map-maker came by these numbers . _ . 
  it does n't match for us , off by 20 million as far as i can tell . 
  but at a glance it works out for ~ ~ spain , ~ ~ slovenia , hungary , bulgaria , czech rep , poland etc. 
  seems the map just has some small ( ish ) mistakes . 
   mount etna , one of the most active volcanoes in the world , began erupting for the first time this year towards the end of last month . 
  seriously , people . 
  sightseeing an active volcano , which is definitely lively `` since the end of last month '' ? 
  it reminds me of george carlin 's rant about `` people who build their homes right next to an active volcano and then _ wonder why they have lava in their living rooms _  . < '', 
  minor nitpicking : it seems strange that he spends most of the time looking at the paper . 
  we get negative points for that in college !, 
  i guess it 's fine if he 's using the paper for dutch which he presumably does n't know ( and it 's a nice touch anyways ) , but english at least should only get the occasional glance at the paper ... \\* grumbles about having firmer criteria for bloody college speeches than for eu politics *, 
   4th top comment was serious , but all the others i saw were jokes . 
  see , i was half-convinced that all the comments on t_d were part of a very convincing , but still ultimately ironic ruse . 
  then donald trump got elected into the white house . 
  maybe his voters voted * ironically * , maybe they were honest , or maybe 4chan 's diagnosis of `` we actually managed to weaponise autism '' is true . 
  in any case , it stopped being funny once t_d and similar gave the option of thermonuclear global war to a * real life dank pepe . 
  wait wait wait what 's going on here , i thought ^ ^ 1 germany mostly pairs up with france or poland !, 
  this is an exciting new development !, 
  * & nbsp ; ^ ( [ 1 ] i get most of my inter-country relations from polandball . ), 
  i think queenstark might be referring to the saltiness that came from the attempted magyarization ? 
  we do n't have a good track record of joining unions where everybody is `` supposed to be equal '' \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af but , seriously . 
  most of the people that lived here at the time were peasants that were more concerned with potatoes than some great nationalistic values . 
  why 'd you try to spread hungarian ? 
  : o to this day i 'm convinced it might have worked if it was n't for the language problem . 
  together 1102-1918 , and we do n't understand a word you 're saying , you special ugro-finnic snowflake  . <, 
  you know how ustashe are the boogeymen for serbs ? 
  chetniks are the same for croats . 
  are you seriously asking that ? 
  :d do n't know about floodplain , we build them * everywhere * . 
  professional builders seem to just do the apartment buildings here , it seems everyone had the grandfather teach the younger menfolk how it 's done - this is when it pays off to have all those cousins , 2nd cousins , good neighbors and so on . 
  you just need to pay them off in beer and building * their * house in turn \\ ^ ^,

  how do you stand when it comes to potential - wind , solar , biomass ? 
  also , any chance of getting some eu investment since you 're formally in the ascension process ? 
  i think you 're right . 
  iirc we get more 50 % of our power from hydro , so if it was counted in renewables , we 'd have much more than 29 % of those . 
  apparently * some * hydro power counts as renewable , but most does n't . 
  it seems that large power plants [ do n't count mostly because they `` disrupt the natural environment '' ] ( http://www.governing.com/topics/transportation-infrastructure/gov-hydropower-renewable-energy.html ) . 
  oh , i get what you 're saying , at least we lose the theoretical breathing room . 
  but since the inception of the kuna , hnb never did anything with it , always kept it `` stable '' ( following bigger currencies ) , even during this latest crisis that started in 2008 and just recently left us . 
  if they have n't done it then , i somehow doubt they 'll do it once the next one hits . _ . 
  as to why they 're so stubborn about it , i do n't know . 
  do n't even know if those were good or bad decisions . 
  but wait , do n't a lot of the greek problems come from the euro ? 
  as in , yes there 's too much government spending etc etc , but if they had their own currency ( devaluing it , i think ? 
  ) , they 'd have more breathing room when it comes to fixing their economy and similar . 
  and the problem is that euro needs to stay the same , so when it comes to greece more and more money is being poured into into a sieve basically . 
  ( correct me if i 'm wrong , this is just the stuff i heard . 
  when it comes to the financial side of it , we 've been pretty stable for a long time ( one of the few things that actually work here ) . 
  and our kuna follows the euro anyways , deutsche mark before that - none of these devaluation tricks are/were used - so changing the name of the currency does n't lose us anything for real . 
  it gets even more glaring if you live in the north and visit the coast/south every few years or so . 
  iirc sometime between 2009 and 2013 , it 's like they started sprouting like mushrooms everywhere . 
  which is a good thing of course , about bloody time we used those winds for something . 
  now if only we sped up the increase in percentage of solar panels , i read somewhere that we could supply several countries our size with solar alone .
