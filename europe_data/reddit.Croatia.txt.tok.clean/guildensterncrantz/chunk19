  `` there are other ways to pay tribute to srebrenica , regardless of the responsibility and the consequences of what happened in srebrenica . 
  all members of the united nations were , if we take the facts into account , equally responsible . 
  in particular the nato members and all those who participated in that period , but did nothing to prevent the genocide in srebrenica . 
  i think it 's an indication that srebrenica really becomes a subject of political manipulation in the moments when srebrenica is needed for someone , but when we in srebrenica need someone , it 's often dropped and they do not come in adequate time , or do n't come at all , '' said durakovi\u0107 . 
  & nbsp ; ** have them leave us alone living with our pain ** mp in the house of representatives of the parliamentary assembly of bosnia and herzegovina sadik ahmetovi\u0107 said on klix.ba it would be best to let srebrenica live with their pain , and that brussels is a place where they need to solve their disputes . 
  `` we are a small , defenseless people , over which the world allowed the committing of the most serious form of war crime , a crime of genocide . 
  no one today can say that they at least tried to help , because the crime in the protected zone of the un in srebrenica took place front of cameras . 
  it was the first time the world watched the crime of genocide on television , and nothing was done '' , ahmetovi\u0107 was unambiguous . 
  he added that the people over whom the genocide was committed should be left in peace , and by no means used , in any context , when a big ones fight . 
  `` the results of the global showdowns can only have greater or lesser consequences for the small and weak . 
  therefore , it would be best to leave us alone to live with our pain , which i am afraid that in today 's world with little or no justice , nobody understands , '' he said . 
  he said that turkey and the netherlands are members of nato , and that brussels is a place where they can resolve their differences through dialogue . 
  `` we will respect any agreement , after the genocide against muslims in srebrenica we hoped that the world , especially europe , would learn their lessons . 
  i 'm afraid that after 22 years we 're even further from the values that then prevailed , not only in europe , but throughout world '' , concluded ahmetovi\u0107 . 
   westboro baptist church should be free to spout their nonsense as should neonazis and the rest of us should spout the opposite . 
  does it work ? 
  since everyone is up in arms about freedom in this thread , because laws against hate speech can get easily twisted in practice ( fair enough ) , let 's talk about whether combating hateful speech with non-hateful speech actually works . 
  you can , of course , use facts against these hateful groups , their arguments usually do n't hold up to logical scrutiny . 
  ok ... let 's look at an example that 's not so much hateful , but more - ignorant and spreading harm through its ignorance : the anti-vaxxers . 
  how does using * logic * work against those ? 
  badly , is n't it , since it 's bullshit believed by easily gullible people , and the consequence is that [ children are dying . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5z3fog/measles_kills_17_unvaccinated_children_in_romania/?ref=search_posts ) in some ideal world , logical arguments - and human rights , in general - would win the case every time . 
  but imo that 's a bit like saying that in a logical world you would n't need police because nobody attacks anyone either physically , emotionally or verbally . 
  every violent hate-group , including whole states committing genocide on the basis of [ gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate_speech ) starts by sharing ideas through words alone . 
   well your quote included fat people it included fat people because in the specific case of reddit , r/fatpeoplehate was banned , then it was r/coontown , and then r/altright . 
  they were banned for doxxing - sharing irl information about reddit users , inciting violence against them . 
  this is one of the no-no 's on all of reddit . 
  the shining examples of humanity that gathered in these subs * loved * to hide their douchebaggery behind `` but my free speech !!, 
  '' , as if that 's some kind of magical shield that protects your `` rights to abuse people '' . 
  eh , i think it depends on what kind of country and rule of law you have , hell it even depends on how active the citizens are in resisting injustice . 
  banana cases will persecute the opposition under the excuses of `` doing away with unpatriotic traitors '' or some such tripe . 
  but those are countries with authoritarian politics and as such they ca n't exactly talk about democratic values or human rights , you know ? 
  and i 'll grant that the line when it comes to discrimination can get blurry . 
  as you say , speech that directly calls for violent action should go first - it 's easiest to recognize , and i think it makes a large percentage of reported cases , anyways . 
  but i think that `` not exactly violent '' racism/misogyny etc etc are also troubling , and should be pushed down . 
  for example , me saying that `` those blacks are much less intelligent and capable of learning civilized behavior '' is n't me calling for direct violence against them , but it 's still racism which some will accept as truth ( especially impressionable idiots or children ) , and it 's usually a short step from that to organized discrimination . 
  why naive ? 
  `` hate speech is speech which attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as gender , ethnic origin , religion , race , disability , or sexual orientation . '', 
  that 's the very first definition . 
  are you talking about the logistical difficulty in implementing measures against it ? 
  possibly relevant pasta ( ? ), 
  from srd , written after the dramatic banning of r/altright :  first the came for the fat people haters , and i said nothing because another person 's weight is n't really my business . 
   then they came for the racists , and i said nothing because i was not a racist . 
   then they came for the nazis , and again i said nothing because , seriously , fuck nazis . 
   then they did n't come after me because i 'm not a hateful little shitgoblin . 
  turns out they were just going after awful people and things are much better now . 
  i do n't know germany 's hate speech laws ( though that should be easy enough to google , for those that are curious ) , but i guess that at the very least it applies to trying to incite violence . 
  statements like `` i hate x '' may pass , but `` why do n't we just kill x ? '', 
  should n't . 
  seems weird for croats to hate bosniaks more than serbs . 
  do n't get me wrong , everyone fought everyone in that war , but at least from the outside looking in - it 's rep. srpska that threatens to annex itself to serbia every once in a while , while you do n't hear the same for herceg-bosna , plus at least they fought together against srpska at the beginning and the end . 
  mind you , that 's like winning the special olympics of `` good alliances '' < . < in short , this is the first i 'm hearing about this version of `` who hates whom in bih '' , except for the blame-ottomans part ( though today it 's more fashionable to blame yuga/serbia/communism / nationalism ) . 
  yes , yes , by now we all gathered that erdogan is a hateful little shitgoblin , but using * srebrenica * of all things for nasty little political points , why does n't he ask bosnia how they 'd like their painful past mentioned in arguments that do n't involve them , oh !, 
  [ shame !,

  do / r/highqualitygifs rules apply ? 
  meta , mentioning of ~ ~ mods ~ ~ / u/arathian , unrelated dickbutt ? 
  oh , in regards to that , people usually have their own washing machines . 
  or at least , i have n't heard about cases where people tend to go to laundromats , or even any kind of `` cleaning somebody else does '' unless we 're talking about very difficult/delicate materials or stains . 
  it 's not much of a thing here . 
  yea it 's weird . 
  by this geo-default logic , i should have been subscribed to r/europe from the start , which was n't the case : i never once saw the sub in my r/front , and i had to subscribe here once i found the sub a month ago . 
  idk how they determine `` from where '' you 're making your account , is it by isp , or do they ask that you say where you 're from - i do n't remember how the registering process went . 
  ( my understanding of the whole thing is that r/all is all of reddit , barring the quarantined/private subs , and those subs that opt out . 
  i definitely see random subs on my r/all that are in no way default , the only criteria seems to be the `` hotness '' of the thread . 
  on the other hand , r/front is just the stuff you 're subscribed to ... plus the defaults ? ), 
  fwiw grumbling about downvotes usually just invites more downvotes in my experience . 
  as to the question of defaults and r/all - afaik r/europe is n't in the `` regular 50 defaults '' . 
  so for most people , it appears in r/all the way every other sub that did n't opt out appears . 
  so that 's how you get random americans finding this sub . 
  however apparently there 's a lesser known version of the defaults - the `` geo-defaults '' . 
  i 've found a bit about it [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/theoryofreddit/comments/40q7jt/how_does_a_subreddit_get_made_a_default/cywuad3/ ) , tl ; dr : if you register from some european location you 'll get r/europe as one of your defaults , which means you 're automatically subscribed to it . 
  but can you just imagine the nosey old grandmas ? 
  it 's annoying enough in the suburbs , where i only get a `` so when are you settling down ? '',

  there should be at least 200 of them in that building :o, 
   should scotland become independent and then wants to rejoin the eu , no one will want a hard border between scotland and england ... 
  it 's not just that , scotland trades with england much more than with eu , right ? 
  and in the geographical sense their situation is the opposite of northern ireland . 
  do n't get me wrong , i think most euros would be happy to get another state into glorious yurop ( much saltiness came from brexit ) , but it 's a question of how much scotland benefits from the rest of uk vs how much eu would invest in it . 
  is the situation between scotland and westminster so bad that splitting off would be worth it ? 
  well the report on us is 73 pages long ... interesting tidbits/tl ; dr : + ** regarding progress in reaching the national targets under the europe 2020 strategy , croatia 's record is mixed . 
  it is on track in terms of energy efficiency , reducing greenhouse gas emissions , increasing the share of renewable energy ( except in transport ) , reducing early school leaving and reducing poverty and social exclusion . 
  however , this is less the case for targets on tertiary education attainment and employment rates , r&d investment and renewable energy in transport . 
  ** + government debt is declining , but still wonky . 
  + private sector debt is declining , but it 's still bad . 
  + financial sector is ok-ish ( i think this is the hnb part ) , but we 're still vulnerable to hijinks like for example that mess with the swiss franc . 
  + unemployment is falling rapidly , it was 12.8 % in 2016 , 3.5 % less than in 2015 . 
  * however * , half of that is `` temporary jobs '' and everyone and their grandmother moving to greener pastures ( literally ireland ) . 
  + business environment still suuuuucks . 
  apparently the productivity of firms is improving , but `` inefficient allocation of resources has prevented productive businesses from growing faster than their less productive competitors . '', 
  also the state-owned firms are the worst , to the surprise of no one . 
  + when we 're at the state level , our courts are still as efficient as extremely epileptic sloths . 
  + state administration - all those godfathers , best cronies , 2nd cousins ' 3rd aunts hired by cronies - it 's still atrocious . 
  * + we really should have gone through with that educational reform . 
  primary/secondary education attendance rates are good , tertiary is increasing , but we still have `` too many goddamn economists '' ( you natives all know what i 'm talking about ) , education in general is n't keeping up with what 's actually needed for the workforce .
