  it 's so much harder to steal from the eu than from local baba mara , sad !, 
  t.t my read of the last few years is that they 're getting moderately nervous about the brain drain and definitely panicky about all the eu funds they have n't managed to pull out yet ( clock is ticking ) . 
  it 's all rather entertaining tbh :d [ ode to joy intensifies ~ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t6jghoc.gif ), 
  mwahahaha ;d side-note : so once we got in , our government of course cheered about that on facebook , twitter etc. 
  now i do n't remember which one it was - i think twitter ? 
  - but in response to that post , some random slovene went like `` yay welcome brothers !, 
  we busted yuga , we 'll bust the eu too ! '', 
  i saw it on a list of `` first reactions '' to our entrance in one of the net.newspapers \\ ^ ^ ( no but seriously now . 
  if eu breaks up , it 'll probably be the western euro 's fault . 
  like some other ~ ~ eternal wars ~ ~ ~ ~ screw-ups ~ ~ things i could think of ... hurr durr . ), 
  so just in case eu breaks up ( and we only just got in ... ) , all you euros are still gon na come here for summer and leave euromonies , yeees ? 
   but the id part would be going too far for him . 
  wait a moment . 
  if i use public transport in my own country , i either have to pay the one-way ticket , or more often - i have the transport-id that i update once a month for some sum of money . 
  this very same transport-id has information about me : my national id , my student-id if i 'm a student , my workplace info if i work . 
  that whole `` open borders '' business is also over-blown , for example we 've had an id-only pass with bosnia for a while now ... and nothing special happens . 
  border guards check it , it takes less than a minute at most times . 
  the idea is - immigrants have to be id 'd as well , which is n't stomping on any of their `` human freedoms '' , for heaven 's sake the citizens of country x do that all the time . 
  * then , connect those databases , and share them among interested countries . 
  * ( this all assumes that the border guards are efficient in checking . 
  though tbh i do n't see why they 'd take more time to check electronic id 's than old passports , or visa 's , or whatever . ), 
  lmao . 
  i almost stopped reading when they reached * pernar * for quotes . 
  if you go to / r/croatia , he 's that sub 's favorite dank meme ;d  yet his populist sentiments have galvanised the youth , and he enjoys a huge following . 
  that would be the same people who ironically voted for harambe and ken bone in usa . 
  he 's literally going on about chemtrails and breaking the power of the banks , by , i do n't know , telling them to gib money back ? 
  idk , it 's all rather incoherent ... though entertaining :p as for `` foreign speculations '' that war might break out in those `` hurr durr balkans amirite '' , why do n't those speculators focus more on russia and usa supporting different sides in syria , eh ? 
  huh , the thread 's been here for an hour , and nobody mentioned [ the emu war . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emu_war ) reddit , i am disappoint . 
   the pipeline will never happen . 
  i 've seen nabucco come and go , and that was when things were going well . 
  this will fail as surely as that . 
  ok i 'm far from an expert into cost/gain measures , but has n't the situation changed since then ? 
  as in , turkey has a rising wannabe-sultan , russia is back into the annexing business , their gas had issues before ( like that recent-ish winter they shut it off cause ukraine was stealing it or something , this is what nordstream is supposed to fix ? 
  ) , and then trump 's support is ... erratic . 
  so that should give us more motivation at the very least . 
  ( as for it being too costly , we 'll see ? 
  iirc some 15-20 years ago people were saying wind is useless/not profitable , now it 's rising fast . 
  we ca n't depend on green-only for sure - at least for now - but less reliance on gas is good . ), 
  as for middle east and `` hard power '' ... do we want to meddle into middle east ? 
  or anywhere else , for that matter ? 
  i think we seriously need an army that can defend europe , but i do n't see why we 'd want to play the `` world cop '' by war . 
  this is n't because i believe the world has changed much for the better , that the powers that be became kindly bleeding hearts ( or if they did , it 's not enough ) . 
  it 's because my take on the way most of the world functions since wwii is - well , these powers that be realized they can get rich much better by trade/capitalism/white-collar robbery , than by war . 
  this is what i think the paper is trying to get at when it throws shade at `` outdated models of power '' - large scale and near-constant war may have made sense * before * , but it does n't now . 
  take for example the middle east , if we assume that - beside embarrassing pissing contests - it 's about * oil * . 
  how has war worked out ? 
  ruined infrastructure , dead workforce - engineers you definitely need included - lunatics running around , both there and in the west . 
  a bit hard to make easy profit from that , no ? 
  for heaven 's sake we have a non-recognized county called isis with a de facto control over [ an area of this size . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/syrian%2c_iraqi%2c_and_lebanese_insurgencies.png/1280px-syrian%2c_iraqi%2c_and_lebanese_insurgencies.png ) as if anyone truly benefits from that . _ . 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  the eu has so far been too slow and erratic in responding to many issues . 
  but we * could * improve that , we do have some important things in our deck . 
  it 's more a matter of `` ca n't be bothered yet '' , than it is `` well they have nothing to bargain with '' . 
  hmm . 
  not so sure about russophilia . 
  perhaps it 's more prevalent in some of the former-eastern block countries , and i have n't noticed ? 
  for example , over here tito told stalin to fuck off all those years ago , and we were one of the bleeding commies . 
  ( i would n't say we 're as russo-phobic as some others , but at best we 're neutral . ), 
  serbia is the biggest exception i can think of , but their case is rather unique ( cough , nato bombing ) . 
  then baltics and poland ca n't stand them as far as i can tell . 
  meanwhile we 're making plans to get another pipeline for oil/gas , but from israel and cyprus . 
  and we 're switching to green energy as fast as we can . 
  so russia 's economic chokehold , as dubious as it already was , will weaken even further . 
  usa ... we trade with them much more afaik , but even that is rather small compared to how much we trade with each other . 
  ( look at those `` top import/export partners '' tables . ), 
  and atlantic need not depend on usa alone , take for example the ceta with canada . 
  the army is the next biggest concern . 
  the solution to that would be making/integrating the eu army ... 
  i do n't know how fast that can happen , or whether it ever will . 
  and that is a big problem . 
  also when it comes to `` power '' - did you happen to read [ this ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/63ahvl/the_brussels_effect_the_unprecedented_and_deeply/ ) by any chance ? 
  it never succeeded on the sub in terms of karma , possibly because the document is 68 pages long - . - '' but it 's an interesting read - neither very fangirlish nor dismissive towards eu . 
  it 's worth taking a hour or two to go through it , imo . 
  asks some interesting questions on `` what is power in the first place ? '', 
  well sure usa can do whatever ... but how is that a change from the last 70 years ? 
  :d meaning , whatever `` power '' europe or the rest of g7 or g20 or the bleeding useless un thought it had - mostly an illusion . 
  usa has been dictating a lot of stuff since wwii , both with its army and its economy . 
  it was a matter of accident/better policies that the west euros went along with it then , but do n't like it * now * . 
  ... or a matter of having less choice . 
  that 's one of the dozen reasons i support eu ( even with its serious flaws ) , it gives europe more ability to shrug off whatever usa wants - or russia wants , remember how bad the `` other choice '' during the cold war was . 
  obviously i 'd like it best if the main power got over its `` schizophrenic moment '' quickly , but given that i was never a huge fan of their military interventions ( starting with vietnam ... ) and the type of capitalism they promote , maybe it 's `` about goddamn time '' europe reconsidered all that nodding along it did with usa . 
  or in this case , we can read between the lines . 
  minister says there 's `` no friction '' , but that 's an obvious politicking-lie given that there 's a lack of a `` joint statement '' . 
  meaning usa has different ideas , the rest of g7 is n't going along with these different ideas , or else the joint statement would be along the lines of `` a chinese hoax '' . 
  europe ca n't make usa go along , but usa also ca n't make europe go along . 
  ( this 2nd is a good thing . ), 
  yea ... 
  i 'd count russian asia as another started-as-colony . 
  russians just managed to hold onto it , unlike the western euros with their own colonies . 
   the uncomfortable choice of handing over personal information , including social media passwords and mobile phone contacts , or running the risk of being denied entry to the country , under a new `` extreme vetting '' policy being considered by the trump administration . 
  ... what the hell ? 
  my boss does n't get my passwords . 
  my mom does n't get my passwords !, 
   tourists from the uk and other us allies including germany and france , could be forced to reveal personal data , as well as disclose financial information and face ** detailed ideological questioning ** ( . . ) [ like this ? 
   slovaks , deal with it , they like us better than you . 
  any guess/explanation why ? 
  for us you 're like these eternal twins ^ ^ 1 that occasionally drink together , with the exception that the czech are the ones doing crazy stuff like climbing biokovo in flip-flops ^ ^ 2 ... then the mountain rescue service has to pick them up \\ ^ ^ [ 1 ] on second look , the differences in approval may as well be statistical errors . 
  my conviction that you 're practically twins may stay unshaken .
