  also , pensions are too low/disorganized . 
  mmh , it could be explained away by comparing it to uk . 
  but yeah , it seems strange to go by `` student assessments '' as you say . 
  our schools are nothing to write home about , and iirc it shows in the pisa science/math tests for our 15 year olds - if it was based on that , we 'd be lower than we are on this map . 
  basing iq on knowledge seems strange in general , even if there is a strong correlation . 
  just about everyone knows at least one * idiot * who 's hard working enough for good grades - they learn by heart . 
  the point of tests that include stuff like raven 's progressive matrices is that you may as well be illiterate , your ability to * think * is what 's tested there . 
  ( hell my youngest brother 's grades were just barely passable , while i had a 's and b 's . 
  he still edges me out by a few iq points . ), 
  those are all the '' - stan 's '' , afaik . 
  i mostly fail at placing them on a map , with the exception of the 3 i added - know the other 4 are somewhere in that area , but the correct order ... : /, 
  [ map . 
  ] ( https://www.google.hr/maps/place/otok+ga%c5%be/@44.9387571,13.7163167,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x477ccff24226ab81:0xd1f94f53b2bec581!8m2!3d44.9387136!4d13.7188446 ) name is ga\u017e apparently , in the brijuni archipelago . 
  [ brijuni are one of our national parks ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brijuni ) , so you may be able to visit with a tour ? 
  ( not sure what 's included in tours , never went there . ), 
  fun side-note : `` in 1945 after world war ii the brijuni became part of yugoslavia and president marshal josip broz tito made the brijuni islands his personal state summer residence . 
  slovenian architect jo\u017ee ple\u010dnik designed a pavilion for tito . 
  almost 100 foreign heads of state visited tito on his islands , along with film stars including elizabeth taylor , richard burton , sophia loren , carlo ponti , and gina lollobrigida . '', 
  ehhh ? 
  the not-free countries are purple here . _ . 
  * here 's to hoping they notice our ... `` thingy '' ( as some dutch fellow called it ) , in the middle , if they go looking for more flags to burn . 
  tbh to me it looks like a counter-attack at luxembourg bragging , that tiny red spot in the west just stands out :p, 
  * side-note : it 's fun seeing mongolia just chilling in the middle of all that red/purple/whatever the bad color is on a particular map . 
  fair enough , it 's not simple . 
  but the question always goes `` why are ee/balkans/whatever poorer than [ insert rich place ] '' , and blaming it on some huuuuge differences in cultural values is also nonsense imo . 
  people are people everywhere , much more similar than different , so while you can generalize and say that for example uk is more `` hard working and honest '' than croatia ( ? 
  ) , i think that all those neat colonies , the natural resources , and the good geographical position makes 90 % of the real difference . 
  because let 's face it , most of this lame peninsula has shit soil , few things to mine , shit mountains in the way of infrastructure ( just look at how much it cost us to build a single highway from zagreb to split ) , and bad position because every single invading horde tries to either takeover and exploit but not really invest , or just burn and destroy on the way to better lands . 
  ( it 's easier to build a rich society if you 're for example a switzerland in the middle of the bloody alps , meaning that no one sane tries to annex you , because why would anyone annex the * alps * ? ), 
  eh , acting like a glorified euro condom against ottomans does n't exactly help development , especially when you 're ruled from distant budapest or vienna ( it 's like the differences between capital cities and the periphery in modern countries , but this time the periphery is n't even the same nation ) . 
  also , the shifting of major trade ( and conquest , insert new clay to exploit ! ), 
  from the mediterranean to the atlantic did n't help either , hell it weakened even the ottomans . 
  then after those two - and some bad wars - passed , we got the communism . 
  it 's like someone cursed us by asking `` well , what else can go wrong ? '', 
  crimea had a majority-russian population , it 's a stone throw away from russia , russia out-numbers and out-guns ukraine in a way that ca n't be compared to turkey and europe , and sadly - most powers do n't care about ukraine the way they do for eu ( eu is one of the powers , actually ) . 
  so tl ; dr : the situation with eu vs turkey has little to no similarities with ukraine vs russia . 
  not my fault we have the most awesome coat of arms :p * but seriously , red and white is vertical and horizontal on the edges , combination in the middle . 
  makes perfect sense to my eyes , 
  so , since there 's a lot of patterns in these flags , maybe change the order a bit ? 
  i like what you have here !, 
  but , it looks very chaotic . 
  not sure in which order to go , but ~ this is an extraordinarily ugly hack job done in 10 minutes of paint ( of all things ) . 
  rough idea : http://i.imgur.com/jh37v1t.png edit : on 2nd look , should switch the 3rd and 5th row . 
  eagles in the middle , lions in the beginning and sort-of end . 
  maybe ? 
  i mean , it 's great that the stuff regarding society/values works out with you . 
  but from what i see/hear on the street in regards to the middle east is just ... exhaustion . 
  it 's like that darkness induced audience apathy you get with people watching media that is way too grimdark , they just stop caring at some point . 
  so i think it may turn out that atat\u00fcrk rolling in his grave will be taken as `` oh , more middle eastern shit , that whole region is backwards '' , instead of making israel in particular stand out more as a good example . 
  i guess it 's kinda similar to how outsiders go `` lmao balkans '' whenever they hear about any argument happening here . 
  and israel in particular - well . 
  what we generally `` know '' is that you 're richer , more advanced ( from tech to society ) , there 's sympathy because wwii , but on the other hand the mess with palestine throws a shade on everything , you 're sort of `` part of the problem '' as well . 
  now as to * why * the politics in the middle east are such a mess , that 's complicated and since it does n't concern our daily lives the way europe/russia/usa do , you 'll get limited understanding of the details :1, 
   eu policy turned out to be a policy of double standards and cheating can someone explain what the `` reasoning '' here is ? 
  they were outvoted 27 to 1 . 
  is there any legal basis under which they can complain , as in this was one of those decisions that need * everyone * on board ? 
  because to me it looks like they 're just bullshitting . 
  and i can get bullshitting if it 's for the sake of looking tough to others , getting more stuff through negotiations and such . 
  but poland is the highest net recipient of eu funds here , it 's not like they have much leg to stand on like for example the uk did . 
  ^ ^ ( there & nbsp ; goes & nbsp ; my & nbsp ; cunning & nbsp ; plan & nbsp ; ; _ , 
  so what you 're saying is , we 're should organize ourselves , secretly take pics of these clerks , with useful descriptions like the statistical likelihood of passing ? 
  which one requires you do n't waste their time on chit-chat , which one is amendable to bribery via fancy liquor ? 
  if said like `` greenland with rise 10/10 ? 
  '' , ok ( but that 's the point of the earlier rice-comment anyways ) , but i thought / u/gormhornbori wooshed the whole thing . 
   umm . . * rise . 
  it 's a meme . 
  see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/2np694/what_tasty_food_would_be_distusting_if_eaten_over/ ) :d, 
   it also would also prevent infighting within that group . 
  like the whole of european history , yes . 
  but it 's not only that , the other problem is that there already exist big nations who - to the surprise of no one - attack smaller/weaker ones . 
  it 's ironic that op mentions ukraine when ukraine is under attack by russia , who `` just so happens '' to not be directly attacking the eu , or usa , or china . 
  because the size of the army and quality of weapons is a big deterrent . 
  hehehe , same here . 
  sometimes i need a 2nd look to notice that `` wait , there 's no gizmo in the middle '' . 
  eh , that assumes that a few years of work in dublin would earn me that much money . 
  ( and the house basically needs no renovations at all , that 's why i said it 's a `` good big house '' . ), 
  idk , we had so many people work in/move to germany in 60 's and 70 's , and they all built themselves nice big houses back home , it got to the point where our colloquial word for ex-patriot is `` gastarbajter '' . 
  but that changed quite a bit since then : west eu is n't importing low-skilled workers at the same rate as before and/or stuff grew 200 % more expensive here in the meanwhile . 
  meaning , the same house that my neighbor built would cost 5x more today , while paychecks did n't grow at the same rate . 
  do n't get me wrong , for those that have nothing here , or for those with no hopes of finding a decent job , moving is definitely more worth than trouble . 
  but for the rest , it 's not so straight-cut . 
  ( take my friend that has an english-teacher degree . 
  since she 's not a native , that degree is worth 7x times less in ireland . ), 
  but we do , in many cases . 
  for those that do n't , it could be any or the combination of the following : 1 \\ . 
  different language . 
  you can hardly know any foreign one as well as you know your own , so now we 're talking about a `` quality of life '' where you basically lack the `` average '' common citizen communication skills . 
  and of the foreign languages , obviously english is most well-known , which leaves you with ireland alone . 
  culture shock . 
  it depends on the country of course , some are more similar than others . 
  but take norway for example , they lead the group in so many areas , and yet my friend who 's no great patriot or emotionally attached to us - he was sick of it within 6 months . 
  so someone who 's pretty `` cold and detached '' here thought that norway is `` too cold and detached '' . 
  similar would probably apply in reverse as well , we 'd be too nosy/chatty/whatever for them . 
  ( hell i experience that whenever i run into an american in the wild . ), 
  related to point 2 ) , let 's say that your `` europoor '' country works/doesn ' t work in different ways . 
  but , at least you know where everything 's at , how and why different things work ( or do n't ) . 
  all that flies out of the window once you move outside . 
  this also applies to for example moving from our coast to the capital , just on a much smaller scale . 
  your odds of making it . 
  if you 're low-skilled here , you 'll be low-skilled there as well , and it 's pretty unlikely the richer countries will want you , or give you a paycheck that 's worth the cost of moving .
