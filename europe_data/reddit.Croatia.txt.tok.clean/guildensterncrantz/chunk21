  if you 're high-skilled , it depends . 
  programmers `` speak '' in code and english basically , they can adjust anywhere . 
  the same does n't apply to lawyers , teachers , historians etc etc , where what you learned in school is usually different depending on the country . 
  this final one varies from person to person , but - if you 're moving somewhere , you 're starting over from scratch . 
  over here , i inherit my grandma 's house with no cost whatsoever . 
  it 's a good big house , but if i sold it , i 'd be able to buy ... some tiny shit apartment in dublin . 
  but there 's no `` declaring '' here . 
  this fellow was quite literally on meds . 
  he could be from just about any * continent * and his most important description would still be `` a paranoid schizophrenic on meds '' . 
  tbh they look like comrades distributing solidarity . 
  * side-note : you ( accidentally , i assume ) posted this comment 3 times . 
  i think most of europe ( barring moldova/belarus/ukraine ) has a bit of a `` first world problems '' thing going on . 
  on my example , croatia is usually somewhere in the ass-end of eu , grouped with romania and bulgaria . 
  and the differences with for example germany or sweden are very visible . 
  but on the other hand , when you look at the * whole world * , and not just by total gdp or the number of millionares but stuff like health care , freedom of speech/press , civil rights , public safety , transport , infrastructure etc , most of the lists divide the countries in 3-5 `` boxes '' . 
  and we 're most often somewhere in the ass-end of the first box . 
  so while it 's true we have a lot of room for improvement , we 're not exactly what westerners think when they laugh `` balkan , amirite '' at us . 
  afaik serbia is worse off than us , but * at worst * that may put you in the `` 2nd box '' , which again hardly makes you a miserable shithole . 
  that would be drc congo , which has `` 35 km of paved road per 1,000,000 of population '' . 
  well there can be political gain if they want to cooperate . 
  it 's not like the uk is some tiny-ass irrelevant country , with or without eu , or that the only thing they can bring to the table is money ( and lame food ) . 
  if the goal of the eu is prosperity and unity for the whole of europe , it 's not like we can leave the uk as some kind of a pariah on the outskirts forever , and that 's before you consider the awkwardness with ireland and northern ireland . 
  mind you i do n't expect for anything great to happen in regards to this for a while , a decade or two at least . 
  * this post reached r/all last i looked . 
  do n't you have that spicy `` hello r/all plebs , behave '' pasta for such events ? 
  the wars of the 90 's were ethnic , not religious . 
  blaming it on religion would be like blaming it on cyrillic vs latin alphabet . _ . 
  huh . 
  this is the first i 'm hearing it . 
  when asked about croatia , most of the ( internet ) people i meet respond with : 1 . 
  never heard of it 2 . 
  war mines death horror balkans huehuehue 3 . 
  saw you on / r/earthporn 5 . 
  aaand more recently : game of thrones ?!, 
  there was also a period of `` aaaah , \u0160uker ! '', 
  back in the 90 's and early 2000 's . 
  any particular reason why poland does n't see it that way ? 
  well , i do n't know the circumstances ... but based on age , the fellow may have emigrated from yuga ? 
  or maybe there 's confusion in regards to ethnicity vs citizenship ? 
  also now i 'm imagining a situation where he has no id/similar , and he 's speaking in one of the 4 * very `` distinct '' languages that are totally not just dialects , no sir !, 
  * that we have here < . <, 
  sooo ... who are the usual suspects for stuff like this ? 
  ( my family on the coast never told me it happens , i wonder why !, 
  it mostly goes like : if meeting germans somewhere in bruxelles , they 're `` nijemci '' . 
  if meeting germans somewhere on our coast , towel reservation of best spots included ( how do they do that !, 
  ) , they 're '' \u0160vabe '' :d, 
  i heard that i 'm supposed to grab my pitchfork in situations like this one < . <, 
  rakija masterrace !, 
  side-note : `` nijemci '' is germans here , too . 
  country is njema\u010dka . 
  though colloquially they 're often '' \u0160vabe '' ( from swabians ) . 
  ha , if it helps , assuming that you have a blank map with names missing ~ bih is that country that we appear to be trying to eat on the map :d serbia is on its eastern border ( and ours ) . 
  as for the baltics , latvia and `` litva '' confused me for the longest time too ( estonia was easiest cause i just needed to remember the e-odd one is on top ) , but - they go alphabetically . 
  tbh i have n't seen it on this sub much , but outside of it - i suppose ? 
  they sound sort of similar ... both are ex-commie east ( ish ) europe , both have fairly small countries that i think a lot of non-european people ca n't place on a map . 
  no tito no party, 
  redditor mixed up baltics and balkans ? 
  insert triggered baltics \\ ^ ^, 
  i 'll go with slovenia . 
  ( just because they 've been pretty quiet for a while now , it 's becoming suspicious . 
   from `` former yugoslavia '' . 
  goddamit czechia . 
  regardless of which color you are , you 're messing up that neat straight iron line !, 
  the population of africa might or might not become a crisis that seriously threatens europe - [ this is a pretty good tl ; dr. ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsbt5eqt348 ) tl ; dr of tl ; dr : every population goes through several stages : high birthrate + high death-rate , high birthrate + low death-rate , which leads to the population explosion , and then it stabilizes at low birthrate + low death-rate . 
  the whole west went through it and not so long ago ( think baby boomers ) , we 're at the stable stage now . 
  developing world is still in that transition , but they are getting there , and faster than we did : technology and international aid is more advanced now . 
  tbh i think the problems caused by climate change may end up being bigger ... and they 'll hit us as well . 
  yep it 's a major problem in europe atm , i agree . 
  though mind you , while it 's fashionable to blame putin for the world 's ills lately , i think he needs to do pretty much * nothing * for eu to either fall apart , or transform into something else that 's less useful . 
  calling certain countries `` pigs '' has been around for a while , and it did n't start in moscow ... or if it did , it caught on so quickly that it points at some ugly truths in regards to how the west/north eu feels about the south . 
  similar goes for east eu , `` europoors '' in general etc. 
  and the south/east is n't blameless here either ( `` omg these westerners are gon na rob us/destroy us/take away our freedom '' etc ) . 
  and all that i 've written here feels unreasonably pessimistic - eu falling apart would be rank idiocy . 
  but recent events like [ trump , brexit , putin 's policies ] are telling me that humanity has n't advanced as much as it seemed 10-or-so years ago . 
   here we see the elitism of the typical western european see how that works ? 
  i could take the wonderful opinions you 're expressing all over this thread as proof of what the people you 're sharing a country with think . 
  but just like the redditor you 're responding to is ... odd ... 
  i assume that you 're not a good representative of the germans . 
  you might try doing something like that one of these days . 
  huh , this is one of the cuter ones . 
  even better than the `` shrug bot '' \u00af \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af \u00af \\ \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af ( i prefer the 2nd version , though ) edit : congrats on your alphabet :d,

   `` do n't worry , we do n't want your gold ''  `` we already have it ''  '' ... be a shame if something happened to it . 
  sad ! '', 
   when greece , italy or others need it . 
  let me guess , you 're talking about the hilariously badly thought-out `` plan '' for dealing with the refugees ? 
  so [ that 's where ] ( http://prigorski.hr/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kolinda-i-pahor-660x330.jpg ) she [ got the idea !, 
   because the local markets offer much better food . 
  it depends on which product we 're talking about . 
  yea , some local stuff is better than imported , so i/we buy that . 
  other things - even the lamer ( in comparison to western eu ) imported stuff is better/cheaper - the cheaper bit is very important when it comes to us `` europoors '' . 
  as to why it 's so , ask globalism , capitalism , whatever - nutella sells globally and ferrero is italian , you may as well ask `` why do n't germany/netherlands/uk / poland/insert country have a brand that 's as successful as nutella ? '', 
  the markets of today do n't exactly sell things as fairly as they should in theory - profit is the holy grail , not customer happiness . 
  ... i 've already explained the situation when it comes to the common customer , and how market chains are using ( abusing ) it for their profit . 
  now several countries are banding together to literally fight against this discrimination , which is `` about fucking time '' . 
  this thread , and several threads on the same topic before - i tend to see people from more privileged countries being confused/angry as to why these countries are doing it now , in this manner ... which in turn confuses me .
