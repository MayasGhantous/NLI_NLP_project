  it goes like `` buy why are you buying shit ?? 
  just stop !, 
  '' , as in , `` if you demand equal quality you 'll get equal quality '' which is ... exactly what these countries are doing right now . 
  but that would make sense if there was a better nutella on the shelves . 
  there really is n't imo , a couple of locally produced ones , but i like them even less than i do the knock-off nutella . 
  so my choice boils down to `` eat or do n't eat nutella-like products '' . 
  and same is repeated across many types of product . 
  plus , my single act of rebellion - one lost customer - will hardly make anyone care , when the rest of the people will continue buying the lamer nutella because they have the same ( not ) choice . 
  and this lamer nutella - it 's not * horrible * , just of lesser quality than what is sold in the `` 1st rate '' countries - for the same price , oh the irony . 
  and because it is n't horrible , and because it has a chokehold on the market , it sells . 
  and since a single customer can hardly negotiate with market behemots , now you have whole countries saying that enough is enough . 
  this is one of the examples of how big organizations like `` country '' can make themselves useful to the small people . 
  what if you do n't have a choice ? 
  all the stuff on your shelves is `` 2nd speed '' . 
  or you do have a m\u00fcller , but there 's only one or two of those in your city , and you wo n't go there for your day-to-day grocery shopping , which is most of it . 
  these shithead companies that claim that tastes vary hardly need to adjust their practices if they dominate the market . 
  i ca n't exactly tell a big chain like m\u00fcller to open up a small shop in 20 different locations in my city , because that 's not what m\u00fcller does here , period < . <, 
   food companies add that they are simply adapting to tastes in different markets . 
  yes , yes , our taste is that we like our fish to have * less fish in it * . 
  here 's one from me : [ political/cultural in dark orange , geographical is the blue line . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/balkans#/media/file:karte_suedosteuropa_03_01.png ) ( apparently we ca n't even agree on what balkan is ! ), 
  at least you have budapest ? 
  apparently , we have only sadness everywhere . 
  at least you do n't grin like a little kid when papuk shows up in the great distance on particularly clear days t.t, 
  imo that 's the best america first video . 
  `` and now are so equal we carry our feminists around everywhere . 
  good old canth would be so proud '' :d, 
  yep . 
  [ your big northern neighbor among them , ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felony_disenfranchisement#in_other_countries ) apparently :d i think it makes sense - most of these prisoners will `` rejoin '' society at some point , why should n't they get a say ? 
  especially since they 're a sadly-interesting group : so many of the criminals end up being such because they fell into some nasty holes in the system . 
  so maybe their opinions are just as valuable - or more valuable - as those of the 1 % , or the lucky-ish middle class and so on . 
  if it 's about integration according to the willingness of countries to participate ( for whatever reason ) , then it looks fair ... but has dangers of fracturing the very concept of unity that the whole eu is built on . 
  when i say willingness , i mean simply countries choosing freely whether they want to participate in for example the eu-army and such . 
  but let 's take it a bit further . 
  what if that example of eu-army goes like : `` you can only participate if you give an x sum of money for it , or an x part of your gdp '' ? 
  both the sum of money and the percentage of gdp do n't have the same impact in various countries . 
  for example germany 's economy ( and its development ) is so strong it can probably spare 2 % of gdp , or a certain amount of euros , while the same does n't apply to hungary or croatia or bulgaria that are just making ends meet . 
  i do n't think it 's an accident that the `` big four '' - germany , france , italy , spain - are the main proponents of multi-speed . 
  now if that 's just because they 're sick of arguing and going nowhere with idk , orban or similar , that 's reasonable from them . 
  but with the amount of snobbery and anti-europoor whining i see from the richer/bigger countries in eu , i somehow doubt that 's the case . 
  or reverse-pimples . 
  cause they 're blue instead of red . 
  why ? 
  i mean , they seem cool . . ? 
  but it 's odd that * anyone * is pretty universally loved . 
  ... is it the `` can not into nordic '' memes ? 
  tbh it does n't make us * anything * much , here . 
  the main thing that changed for us is ... easier travel , both ways . 
  we get more tourists , though mind you our tourism was growing a lot even before eu , it 's in dispute how much the slightly-less-hassle at the borders affected that . 
  and we get an even more serious brain drain , which is good in that we have fewer unemployed young people ... and a disaster because we were one of the countries experiencing a population decline long before eu , and trying to keep the country going in 40 years will be ... interesting . 
   part of the reason is because of eastern european racism against immigrants . 
  so now being too poor for their liking is called racism ? 
  look up the stats . 
  look up how many people hungary let in in the long time before they started using tear gas , and how many of those asked for asylum . 
  then at one point while we were hit with the big wave - [ `` out of 13500 migrants , * one * woman claims asylum for herself and her children . 
  '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3leybm/out_of_13500_migrants_who_have_entered_croatia/ ) and it 's not because we 're racist towards them , but because they `` want germany and sweden '' . 
  that 's all they ask for when they come in whatever not-germany-rich country , getting transport through the country as fast as possible , and they even refuse fingerprinting and such - because they do n't want to return to one of the not-germany countries . 
  first time i 'm seeing this particular triggering ( you do n't seem to be the only one in this thread ) . 
  hmm . 
  do n't have the timing on the map ... but let 's assume that the world `` syphilis '' did n't get invented only 100 years ago -  there should be at least some `` ottoman disease '' on the map , no ? 
  so assuming that it spread from one place to another ( which may as well be false as far as i know - because i do n't know anything about it ) , if you go by the name ( s ) alone , you can make a few chains ~ france -  spain -  benelux , denmark ; portugal -  uhhh , japan ( ? ), 
  france + spain -  gb&i reland france -  nordics ; germany -  poland -  russia france -  italy -  balkans -  asia minor -  middle east -  ... ? 
  -  india with china and scotland being outside of the chain/having different names for it because why not . 
  so in conclusion : it 's all france 's fault . 
  < conspiracy hat on  unless * italy * got away with starting it all !, 
  we do that `` tap forehead , for idiots '' thing here . 
  * also that `` twirl finger for crazies '' that english speakers think is outdated . 
  how do they indicate crazies , then ? 
  cross their eyes or what ? 
  and not just long-term , if i understood this right . 
  among other things :  sentinel 2b will also monitor natural disasters such as floods , earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , as well as support humanitarian relief efforts . 
  nasty flooding in particular - well , you hear about it happening in europe every few years . 
  better coordination can only help . 
  huh , i 'd have picked [ vukovi umiru sami . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pfaelefo28 ) ( mind you [ bosnia beats all us ex-yugos . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlin3mcsh4 ) ), 
   overall , rates of uxoricide are much higher than rates of mariticide . 
  of the 2340 deaths at the hands of intimate partners in america in 2007 , [ female victims made up 70 % . 
  ] ( https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/ipv-factsheet.pdf )  [ in the region of south-east asia , ] ( http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85239/1/9789241564625_eng.pdf ) 55 % of all murdered women died at the hands of their partner , followed by 40 % in the african region and 38 % in the americas . 
  preliminary findings of an ongoing study [ estimate that globally , approximately 35 % of murders of women are committed by intimate partners . 
  ] ( http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77421/1/who_rhr_12.38_eng.pdf ), 
  are you talking about feminists or `` radfems '' here ? 
  this is an important question , it 's like the difference between regular men and the red pill . 
  would n't be fair to judge half of humanity for their particular rare lunatics , you know ? 
  and / u/raven630 gave you good explanation of the differences in powers of men and women in a patriarchal societies . 
  if you do n't recognize this as your society :  there 's generally a ceiling career wise and most respectable women are housewives . 
  ... then congratulations , progress !, 
  on the other hand , here 's another example from / u/auckland345 :  patiarchy is a system where men dominate powerful positions . 
  as there is n't a country where the men/women are represented roughly equal and most of the positions are dominated by men they are . 
  now if that last one rings as false to you - you may not be dominating any powerful positions - and your life is n't anywhere as close as * easy * as the lives of the `` top men '' , consider whether your average , not particularly [ talented , lucky , * sexy * ] woman has it easy working an unskilled-labor job for a lower wage than the equally unskilled man , whose paycheck is bigger just because he 's born physically stronger and so he gets the job that 's more physically demanding . 
  mmh , but if that 's the case then balkans do n't make much sense , same for turkey . 
  they 're not exactly progressive when compared to the west , and yet they 're doing much better than the more northern east . 
  looking at the map , it 's not about weather , or economy , or religion , or social rights , corruption , or being in the eu even . 
  which makes it a more interesting map than the usual west/east divides , but i 'm stumped atm . 
  suppose it just varies from specific country to specific country , for whatever complicated reasons i do n't know as an outsider . 
  gib back clay * sorry , browsed too much polandball recently . 
  but the map is strange . 
  does n't seem to have much to do with the economy ( cause balkans , mostly ) or different prevalence of patriarchy/feminazis ( balkans again ) . 
  maybe it 's about rakija ? 
  but wait , does romania have rakija ( they 're the oddest duck here ) ?
