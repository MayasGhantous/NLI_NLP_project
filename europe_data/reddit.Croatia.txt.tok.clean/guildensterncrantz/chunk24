  but they did n't seem to feel very strongly about it , it 's like haggling is more of a pastime for them , 
  i 'll give you that the way it 's written is too self-important ... but . 
  russia , usa and china are n't carrying that torch , or at least they are n't with their * alternative policies and good comrades * in the recent times . 
  most of africa is still crawling out of the hole , with just a few exceptions . 
  india is ... 
  i do n't know . 
  developing , but it 'll take more time . 
  let 's not even go to middle east , it 's a sad place . 
  that leaves us with ... south america ? 
  or australia stronk ? 
  do we really want to give the leadership of the free world ^ tm to a bunch of smirking kangaroos ? 
  important questions here !, 
  russians , perspective ? 
  beyond just `` the loss of power on world stage '' . 
  why the perception of there being more mutual distrust and bitterness in the world ( when before we had the iron curtain ) ? 
  also , `` 53 percent said that they missed the unified economic system '' - how did the transition work out/didn ' t work out ? 
  ( i 'm wondering if it 's similar to our own `` yugo-nostalgics '' . ), 
  [ starting here does n't help ? 
  ] ( https://razvoj.gov.hr/ ) ( i would n't know , not doing business here . ), 
  also i think that what / u/zmeiotpirin is referring to is us finally getting a move on with actually using these funds for something . 
  a while back i read something about 2016 being twice as good as drawing them out when compared to 2015 ( or it might have been 2014 and 2015 , but i think it 's more recent than that ) . 
  huh , so that 's basically opposite of us . 
  mind you , i would n't say we have `` a lot '' of wind farms - at least compared to how many more we could install - but [ they 're growing ] ( https://renewablesnow.com/news/croatia-posts-sharpest-increase-in-wind-power-capacity-in-see-in-2015-ewea-512568/ ) much , much faster than anything solar here . 
  despite the fact that our coast has so many sunshine hours we could supply power to several countries our size . 
  i 've decided to blame it on an organized conspiracy against our greatest historical national enemy : propuh . 
  every single grandma will tell you that you 'll get seriously sick from drafts . 
  it 's worse than sitting on cold surfaces , according to them :d, 
  same here . 
   the anti-bolshevik faction of this party , known as the right srs , which remained loyal to the provisional government leader alexander kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the bolsheviks in the course of the russian civil war and subsequent persecution . 
  if you 'll follow the german anschluss of the best places on our beaches , same sunscreen policy applies here \\ ^ ^, 
  nadan vido\u0161evi\u0107 , the former head of the hgk - croatian chamber of commerce * . 
  arrested in 2013 , the court is moving with the speed of a particularly epileptic sloth , as is the custom here . 
  last i heard of it is that his trial for corruption finally properly started a month or so ago . 
  somewhere in his basement/villa , they found a collection of paintings worth 5 million euros , the standard collection of expensive wristwatches ( idk if it 's just here that collecting wristwatches is a * thing * for the powers that be ) as well as ... 
  [ this . 
  ] ( http://www.lovac.info/images/stories/novosti/2013/vidosevic%201.jpg ) * there 's a running gag here , about how all business owners need to pay certain taxes to the hgk , and yet we 're searching for an honest businessperson who ever had any use for that organization - have n't found any yet . 
  i have no earthly idea what those professional watch-collectors are even supposed to do . 
  looks like map-maker forgot us again : < when it says yesterday , i assume that it means `` the share of wind power in country x by march 2017 '' instead of `` this particular * day * , the turbines were all on strike or something '' . 
  [ whole report for 2016 from windeurope.org is here ] ( https://windeurope.org/wp-content/uploads/files/about-wind/statistics/windeurope-annual-statistics-2016.pdf ) . 
  anyways in it , by the end of 2016 we had 422 mw , compared to for example estonia with 310 mw , czechia with 281 mw , and hungary with 329 mw . 
  i could buy estonia 's percentage in consumption being better cause they consume less in total ( fewer people , d'oh ) , but not hungary and czechia . 
  wait , wait . 
  are you proposing we take potato ? 
  also it 's not like the richer eu countries do n't benefit from the brain drain from poorer ones , or easier trade , or an union that 's politically and geographically bigger . 
  ( not sure about the whole of europe , but in eu - afaik , yes . ), 
  romania has much better reasons to protest , and while it 's good from them that they 're doing something against such corrupt proposals , the fact that their government wants to make itself immune to justice in such open ways - it does n't look good . 
  oh dear oh noes , now what ?!, 
  our glorious leaders ca n't even say `` well at least we 're better than romania and bulgaria '' !, 
  how are we supposed to handle this * identity crisis * ? 
  bulgaria , please please be a dear and do n't pass us , too . 
  the stuffed polar bears bought with stolen tax money by people whose purpose in the government nobody knows depend on you , if we should somehow become worst , something * radical * might happen - like for example the mass firing of people who buy stuffed polar bears with stolen tax money :0, 
  oh , sure it is . 
  but just going off my impression , i 'd say that a way bigger proportion of the women in our fandom is on tumblr , facebook or even various fanfic sites . 
  we have something like a chicken or egg situation on the sub : did the high ( ish ) proportion of dany-haters/stannisbros evolve on the sub naturally ( because stannis did nothing wrong ) , or did they come first and chase away the girls ( stannis is an asshole manchild ) ? 
  i believe you , but that 's ... unusual . 
  this is n't a sub organized around some male-dominated topic , you know ? 
  hell the last we checked on r/asoiaf we had something like at least 20 % girls , and that 's a limited poll-resource . 
  and the asoiaf story itself is perhaps a bit closer to traditional-male-space/topics , * i think * . 
  why would this sub be even worse than that ? 
  actually , it should be much higher than 5 % . 
  statistics are foggy and they vary by subreddit , but the more legit stats i can find say that somewhere around 1/3 of redditors are female . 
  [ for example alexa agrees with that . 
  ] ( http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com ) it 's just that reddit is mostly anonymous , which somehow translates to people thinking they 're mostly talking with men instead of figuring it 's 50/50 or at least something more even than `` there are no girls on the internet '' . 
  then if you 're a part of a smaller sub that has established `` regulars '' with gender-neutral names ( or lacks gendered grammar ) , everyone gets really surprised when the topic comes up - `` omg you and you and you are all women ? '', 
  ( anecdotal : i get called `` dude/man/bro '' around every two days . 
  do n't bother correcting because it 's awkward . ), 
  uhh , i 'm agreeing with you ? 
  that is , you say that it 's wrong to hate countries for their former policies , which is the argument of those that were occupied by ottomans . 
  because this happened over a 100 years ago . 
  i 'm adding to your argument , because wwii is even `` fresher '' in the memories of this sub , and yet you do n't see us hating on each other for that . 
  * also as a side-note , many of those that were occupied by ottomans in some distant past have fresher `` villains '' to hate atm ( soviets , the mess that is former yugoslavia etc etc ) . 
  not even 100 years - wwii is fresher than that . 
  by that `` hate them cause ottomans '' logic , most of this sub should hate most of this sub . 
  well fwiw atat\u00fcrk 's reforms are seen as a very positive example here , sort of like `` well if * they * could do it , why ca n't we ? '', 
  unfortunately it looks like the more recent events are undoing all that ... : <, 
  is it just me , or does the title imply that eu will support irish reunification ? 
  :d which is n't the case in the article . 
  all it talks about is the benefits that both sides of the border got from being in eu , and how troublesome this change is ( starting with trade issues ) . 
  it 's not the case of eu saying it 'll support the ni waving a revolutionary flag against the uk \\ ^ ^, 
  idk , perhaps it works like that for you because you 're * france * - you 're not exactly a total pushover even without alliances . 
  as in , you have enough size in area and population , your economy is ok and same goes for internal resources should you go into isolation , your army is ok too ( especially the nukes ) . 
  but most of the sovereignty arguments i hear from smaller countries ( be it in area or army or economy ) are functional bullshit : looks very neat on paper ( freedom !, 
  ) , in practice it 's nonsense . 
  these countries are anything but self-sufficient - they have to import a lot of stuff , like for example this neat reddit platform i 'm using atm ; and they 're not able to defend themselves should the bigger fish ( which comes down to a smaller number of countries ) decide to screw them over . 
  so , you have to make various alliances , and the moment you make them , you have to give up some of your `` sovereign '' ability to be your own sole master . 
  [ slightly relevant polandball ~ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/kstjxeq.png ), 
  sure , but do we really need our cities to be so * neon * ? 
  it 's like a carnival . 
  i ca n't sleep unless i completely draw the blinds , to the point i 'm basically hermetically closed . 
  it 's especially annoying during the hot summers . _ . 
  and i miss the stars . 
  have n't seen the [ milky way ] ( https://fairfaxparks.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/milky-way-derek-rowley-derekscope.jpg ) in my life , but at least i could sort-of see the stars on the street when i was a kid . 
  and the same street ( s ) were n't so dark you could n't see where you 're going at night . 
  this state of perpetual twilight at night is too much < . <, 
  i do n't know if i 'm more disturbed by the fact that i can clearly see the nile ( are n't we taking this light pollution too far ? ) ... 
  or that north korea looks to have vanished in a black hole . 
   the eu seems to want the uk to sign its name to a bill for nothing in return no , they want the uk to pay up on the commitments it took :  the eu 's $ 1tn , seven-year budget was negotiated in late 2013 by eu leaders including the british prime minister . 
  it is due to expire at the end of 2020 , although bills may be trickling in until 2023 . 
  and  gr\u00e4ssle said the $ 60bn estimate looked reasonable when the uk 's share of eu liabilities , pensions and budget promises was taken into account . 
  but the estimates vary from 20-70bn .
