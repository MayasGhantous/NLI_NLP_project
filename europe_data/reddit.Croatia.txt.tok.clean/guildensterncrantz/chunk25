  now , let 's say you do n't pay up whatever the final sum is . 
  how can you expect a good-will deal like ceta after that ? 
  as for this having nothing to do with eu disbanding , let 's not be politically naive . 
  you were one of the oldest and strongest members of the eu , which is increasingly pressured by big armies and economies in the globalized world , as well as internal nationalistic and structural tensions . 
  you literally rage-quit on the project . 
  how the eu handles this * ugly * divorce makes all the political difference in the world . 
  afaik the best possible carrot the eu can offer is something like what switzerland and norway have . 
  but that would n't be considered a carrot in uk because the main rallying points of brexit were less immigration and more sovereignty , both of whom you can kiss goodbye if you want to stay in the common market . 
  so , the next option is negotiating good trade deals , because you 're still part of europe and nobody wants to actually ruin you , or be an idiot when it comes to doing business . 
  but it wo n't be like in eu , without you agreeing to * give * like norway and switzerland do ( but wait , they 're in schengen - nevermind , again ) . 
  as for the payments - what do you expect ? 
  for eu to say `` oh ok , rage-quitting is totally fine '' ? 
  they may as well disband such a * weak * union instead . 
  huh , this is the first such map where someone gets it kinda-right . 
  it 's `` hrvatska '' for us . 
  also we 're identical in `` italija , makedonija , albanija , austrija , slovenija , belgija , latvija '' . 
  hmm , so we 're closest to ... lithuanian here . 
  btw we call you `` litva '' . 
  the benefit is that the notions of `` union and equality '' become less * empty posturing * written in some promotional pamphlet written in bruxelles , as far as the non-western eu is concerned . 
  ( i know that this is political saber-rattling . 
  i know it probably wo n't go through if usa wo n't play ball - which it probably wo n't . 
  but the support for it that i 'm reading in bloody reddit comments still means more to me than some promotional pamphlets . ), 
  right , but that would be like judging men 's rights movements ( that do have things to fight for , like for example father 's rights ) with the likes of the red pill , which also proclaims itself as a fighter for men 's rights . 
  ** southern lazy illiterate race unite !, 
  ** & nbsp ; but seriously now op , this is great . 
  so many of the current stereotypes present in * 1903 * schools , makes you wonder :d, 
  well at least we 're all duly grateful for the cuisine ? 
  and coffee , for some reason i have this idea that you brought the vital sanity liquid to the balkans a couple of centuries ago . 
  ( do n't disabuse me of that notion . ), 
  right , but these increased demands are coming to trump 's desk , so that 's why i 'm musing about the odds of him agreeing to it . 
  ( somewhere close to zero . ), 
  plenty of le pen and eu falling apart ( lulz ) , too . 
  but in the last week , no hits on such an article ( within the first page of results ) when searching with either `` eu '' or `` visa '' . 
  oh come on . 
  most of what i 've heard from trump in the last year and some is criticism of either eu as a political union or specific eu countries ( bonus rally cookies for throwing shade at eu countries for how they 're handling immigration , * because he saw that on fox news * ) . 
  and his opinions on putin and/or russia are much more positive and friendly than what 's usual for usa presidents . 
  chinese hoax !, 
  [ do we count as non-barbarian , ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/20/26/e4/2026e473aad24c491f11db6b2e990f7c.jpg ) italy ? 
  ohh man , now i miss gyros again . 
  we have fairly good burgers , kebab , a million things that 'll clog your arteries like it 's running out of style , but i have n't yet found the handsome example on the left side ; _ ; * which is all a bit ironic , because when i spent 10 days in greece in 2005 , we had something like a gyros overload - it was everywhere . 
  grumbled `` if i see it in the next 10 years , it 'll be too soon '' . 
  it 's like i cursed myself :0, 
  you forget the amount of international violence - that 's also a factor . 
  usa has seemingly been at war with someone `` every other tuesday '' , for as long as i remember . 
  and while your internal violence stats are n't on the same level as congo ( well , d'oh obviously they are n't even close ) , you 're usually somewhere in the [ lower end of the developed countries . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#by_country ) apparently that 's not enough to offset the wars . 
  yea i do n't expect that trump and his cronies will cooperate on this . 
  not * impossible * , but very unlikely , regardless of everyone else cooperating ( something something , build a wall ) . 
  maybe it 's the political stand-off between the federation and republika srpska ? 
  as in , srpska occasionally threatens to annex itself to serbia . 
  not sure whether that counts , though . 
  i wonder how many of these believers are what i call `` the holiday faithful '' . 
  as in , the churches are full for christmas and easter , and nearly everyone would like to marry in a fancy one - [ not that i blame them tbh , ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/27/fc/3e/27fc3e07c44cb06c0ee15ebd5aac545f.jpg ) it 's so much nicer than the clinical state office . 
  it 's fascinating how most of our `` godly '' folk pick and choose the most convenient bits , like the sacraments - compare the numer of people confessing their sins to those sacraments that mean a big party ( there 's a pig turning on the spit somewhere ) for extended friends and family :d, 
  knowing the speed of eu-usa diplomacy , sometime in 2045 ? 
  :p but seriously now , this was just the parliament . 
  the council would need to confirm it first , and then there 's the usa side of the story : they can decide to give in to the demand , assuming that the proposal even goes through from our side . 
  ( for a fairly good tl ; dr of the eu structure/governance , see [ here ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5x2hqr/eu_parliament_to_vote_on_visa_regime_for_us/deezpgz/ ) . ), 
  my opinion is that this is a gesture of solidarity to the eastern eu ( in the midst of the eu crisis - lots of skeptical people ) , plus the parliament rattling the saber at usa because this issue with the visas is fairly old , usa is still the only one with no promises to introduce equal visas for all of eu ( while the reverse is n't true ) and so on . 
  tl ; dr : it 's highly unlikely you 'll need a visa this summer . 
  yes , but among the arguments i usually see for visa refusal , overstay rate is the most common . 
  i 'm trying to figure out * why * the refusal rate is at 5,29 % . 
  as i said , it would n't be the suspected violence . 
  another issue can be infectious diseases , but we 're clean in regards to that ( cleaner than usa i 'd say , with how much more popular anti-vaxxers are there ) . 
  illegals come to mind again , but ... look at the total number of expected departures in 2015 . 
  it 's 20,781 - this is tiny , and for good reason . 
  the type of illegal worker , or beggar , or welfare tourist that richer countries fear - they usually do n't have the means to even travel to usa , legally or not . 
  or it 's much , much cheaper to reach germany , which gives welfare more freely anyways . 
  ( not that this is the goal - our folks go to richer eu to earn * a lot of money * , which means having a job , not begging for welfare . ), 
  so i looked into it - tried to figure out why croatia in particular needs a visa . 
  there 's a much cited figure : the number of visas rejected . 
  the threshold is 3 % . 
  [ for 2015 , ] ( https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/statistics/non-immigrant-statistics/refusalrates/fy15.pdf ) we had 5,29 % . 
  ok ... another figure that 's cited as a big part of the reason for visa rejections is the number of overstays , which makes a lot of sense . 
  [ for 2015 , again ] ( https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/fy%2015%20dhs%20entry%20and%20exit%20overstay%20report.pdf ) , we have ... 1.09 % , which is lower than some of the visa-free countries . 
  sooooo ... it 's not that . 
  i do n't know what it is . 
  the illegals ? 
  have n't found any stats yet , but that idea sounds more than a bit odd because why try usa when you can legally go to ireland ? 
  it certainly would n't be the amount of `` suspected terrorists '' - unless you count the football hooligans as terrorists - because we 're * 77 places above * usa in the [ global peace index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_peace_index#global_peace_index_rankings ) . _ . 
  finally , i was wondering whether i should feel sad about all this , like the world does n't like me for whatever reason . 
  [ here 's a list of countries i need a visa to visit . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/visa_requirements_for_croatian_citizens#visa_requirements ) well ... 
  i feel better now :p, 
  i do n't know if i 'm seeing things - looks like iraq takes a bit of iran , too ? 
   everyone gets smaller or stays the same  except for ireland xd, 
  [ obligatory ~ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb6bwsa_ldq ), 
   after we 've been stripped of them for peanuts , why does that sound familiar ? 
  ; _ ; mind you , on the other hand , i 'm not sure it 's just the capitalist pigdogs ( well , they 're just white-collar thieves actually ) that are the only ones to blame . 
  we had way more industry and jobs sure , but the jobs were for pretty low paychecks ( lower than today ) , and what we were producing would n't have been able to compete in the globalized industry anyways . 
  it 's that old difference between mercedes and trabant . 
  because they 're poor ( retirement money is small ) and they 're collecting plastic bottles to sell ? 
  it 's free money . 
  but if they were starving-poor , they 'd go to the soup kitchens . 
  and how constantly is `` constantly '' ? 
  i barely see them in osijek , and even when i do it 's in the early mornings after the drinking kids go home . 
  ( of the homeless , uhhh ... there are none . 
  a couple of beggars , but nobody sleeping at doorsteps or under bridges , which is n't that non-existent in the glorious west . 
  same for the starving . ), 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marriageable_age#europe ) at least not in europe .
