  the legal marriageable age is 18 in all european countries , with the exception of scotland ( 16 ) and andorra ( 16 ) . 
  there can be extenuating circumstances , where it 's lowered to 16 in most , 15 in some , but as a rule that 's with the consent of parents and/or the court , or the girl is pregnant ( court again ) . 
  which is no surprise , the [ age of consent ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ages_of_consent_in_europe ) is usually set at 14-16 , and even there you usually have complications - two non-adult teenagers screwing is different from for example a 14 year old + a 35 year old . 
   the girl was married off to a cousin when she was only twelve years old . 
  what utter nonsense !, 
  iirc that map was for 3rd language ? 
  but anyways , yea german is the most common 2nd foreign here , though it gets fewer years/less school hours than english . 
  and iirc some high schools do n't take german as 2nd , but french/italian/spanish ( i think ) . 
  but even with plenty of schooling , there are two problems : a ) german stays in our memories similar to how for example math , history or art stay ( they do n't ) ; b ) and then there 's only so much language you can learn in any school , especially when its grammatical genders just are n't cooperating ( * das * m\u00e4dchen , wat !, 
  i 'm still salty ) . 
  so our english is , idk , something like 10 times stronger than our german , because we 're constantly exposed to it through media and internet . 
  rammstein lyrics just ca n't keep up : <, 
  yes , yes , but how do delije and torcida feel about that ? 
  oh do n't over-dramatize . 
  most people either work legally or they do n't work at all - even the idiots learned by now that the `` illegal employers '' tend to forget to give you a paycheck . 
  we had 1 642 474 people in the labor force in 2015 , the notion of all these people being illegal is nonsense , how would the country gather all those taxes anyways ? 
  and the notion of starving is ridiculous also . 
  being unemployed ! = being homeless/starving . 
  you 'll probably be very poor , yes , but this is n't a 3rd world country or usa . _ . 
  well language is a big deal - most of our youth knows enough english , german and other languages are a different story . 
  so in eu we 're down to ireland and uk , and uk is ... well . 
  the perception was that they 're less welcoming to foreigners ... turned out that it 's not an unfair perception ( cough , brexit ) . 
  also , see , we feel like we 're culturally closer to ireland than many other eu countries . 
  all those northerners/central euros are so dreadfully serious ( w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk w\u00f6rk !, 
  ) , we sympathize with your troubles with uk , and most importantly you appreciate the importance of pubs !, 
  sitting down with your friends for a coffee or a pint , how can some people live without that is beyond me o.o, 
  mmh , she and her fiance plan to return after 10 years or so . 
  her case is complicated - she could ( and did ) find a job here , but her fiance does n't have college education , so his pickings here are pretty slim , and also a lot of it is related to the paycheck ( why work for way less money if you do n't have to ? ) . 
  plus both of them are what i call `` travelers '' , before that they spent two years in vietnam ( of all places , i was `` lol wut ? '', 
  when they first came up with that plan , but it turns out that the bad rep vietnam has here is very exaggerated ) . 
  side-note : a lot of our youth is leaving for ireland , i actually know more people over there than in germany , which is our traditional `` promised land '' . 
  so ... yay ireland , you 're doing something right ? 
  it 's a creative attempt to rekindle the flame war , i 'll give em that xd, 
   australia * i 'm not even austrian and i 'm triggered, 
  and when we look at the uglier side of it , most people are straight and even if they do n't have anything against gays , they 'd feel less motivated to help them because they 're straight and they lose nothing . 
  abortion is like the total opposite of that :d and from the examples i know , all of my ultra-catholic old aunts , both grandmas , their old friends from the neighborhood - they all feel that abortion should stay . 
  funny how those old-fashion `` values '' bend when it 's convenient \\ ^ ^, 
  and then the government brags about taking down unemployment . 
  yes , yes , that 's all very nice , my college educated best friend is leaving for ireland next month , she 'll make another wonderful statistic !, 
  mmh , tesla was more complicated - croatia and serbia have ( well , * had * is more of a case nowadays because war ) something like a `` dual identity '' for croat serbs and vice versa . 
  where you strongly identify with both countries , you know ? 
  but i said `` let 's not even start '' because croatia and serbia would like an exclusive claim to tesla , and it ends up in idiotic internet wars , where some troll because they 're bored , others take it seriously . 
  and the hilarious thing is - tesla himself would n't care for these discussions . 
  oh dear , let 's not even start that one !, 
  he was a serb by ethnicity , born in croatia . 
  he liked both . 
  he moved to usa * because obviously he did * , end of story . 
  also if the talk about peace and unity and mutual appreciation in yurop is n't really your thing , remember that if we stay separate , as far as the world stage goes , we 're all small and crunchy and taste good with ketchup \\ ^ ^, 
  ah , none that i saved . 
  those are just the two i could remember and search for off the top of my head . 
  they 're in r/polandball , try searching there ? 
  edit : here 's [ another one . 
  ] ( http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/polandball/images/3/35/country-balls-parenting.png/revision/latest?cb=20151024124902 ), 
  i assume you want the lyrics to be in separate lines ? 
  you need to use extra spaces/empty line for it . 
  this :  euro neuro , dont be dogmatic , bureaucratic  you need to become pragmatic -   euro neuro , dont be dogmatic , bureaucratic  you need to become pragmatic fixed :  euro neuro , dont be dogmatic , bureaucratic  you need to become pragmatic -   euro neuro , dont be dogmatic , bureaucratic  you need to become pragmatic, 
  [ i know i know !, 
  i do n't know about others/the world , but over here ~ greece is balkans geographically , but not culturally . 
  they had their own distinct thing/culture much earlier than the rest of us , and their influence/politicking in the more northern parts was smaller . 
  hell when it comes to history/culture , i guess you could argue that turkey is closer than greece ( cause ottomans , d'oh ) . 
  slovenia ... we see them like a lovechild of us and austria . 
  they were close to them for a long time ... but then again , you can argue that the similar should apply to croatia , cause most of the parts were under strong venetian , italian , hungarian , austrian influence for a long time as well . 
  then slovenia was part of yuga the same as we were ( and yuga is totally balkans !, 
  ) , so now we like to snicker at them trying to act like `` we 're not like those guys , really ! '', 
  3rd time 's the charm ? 
  :d but seriously now , perhaps donald and brexit may actually work against her . 
  those two have n't shown smooth sailing after they won - seemingly half of the news coming from uk is hard negotiations and uncertain/failing economy , while donald 's policies are fascinating surrealism including `` is this real life '' * alternative facts * . 
  so maybe those two examples may end up making the moderates reconsider ? 
  and as others point out , she has to win the 2nd round as well as more political allies later on . 
   we will even make sarma only using rice uhhh ... there 's sarma made with something other than rice ? 
  or only with rice ( whaaaat ) ? 
  as in , the vital ingredients are rice , minced meat , cabbage . 
  ^ ^ ( did & nbsp ; i & nbsp ; just & nbsp ; say & nbsp ; something & nbsp ; bad ? ), 
  yes , i see that he 's pushing for other - imo better - scenarios . 
  i do n't like this idea of 2-speed europe , for various reasons . 
  first is that we already have something like that , at least in practice ( not by law maybe , but definitely by economy , brain drain , help from eu funds received , political cooperation etc , meaning the measures that matter more ) . 
  it seems to me that those who are interested in scenario 3 would just put a `` whatever , screw you europoors '' and/or `` fine , you can cooperate even less '' on legal paper , which makes me wonder what 's the point of being in eu even more than i do now . 
  and seeing that we already have public knowledge of certain countries doing better/worse than others ( for various reasons , again ) , you 'd expect the examples in that scenario would be more specific . 
  so the examples have nothing to do with anything ? 
  12 states , 15 states . 
  so there 's no reason for these numbers , for example in the case of the 12 states , it 's completely random , meaning there are no existing agreements , or even hints of agreements , between any particular 12 states ? 
  and the 21 states example is even more concerning imo . 
  ** `` workers in 21 member states can access additional and increasingly similar labour rights and social protection regardless of their nationality or place of residence '' . 
  ** no reason for [ 6 others ] to fall in the cracks in the system ? 
  like `` for example '' bulgaria , romania , croatia , latvia , hungary , poland ( just going by ppp here ) . 
  or any list of states that usually do n't cooperate - or fail - in the efforts to increase/normalize labour rights and social protection across the eu ? 
  if these numbers are just totally random examples that do n't reflect anybody 's plans or wishes in any way ... fine . 
  but that does n't make them very useful information for an average citizen wanting to know `` how will my country being shoehorned into the lower-speed europe affect me ? 
  all i heard is that merkel is interested in the idea , and obviously germany wo n't be in this literal 2nd class . '', 
  < rant  here is your problem , eu . 
  you 're about as clear as fog !, 
  here i am , average denizen of the internet , getting curious as to which states are these :  15 member states set up a police and magistrates corps &  connected cars are used widely in 12 member states and nothing !, 
  at least , nothing on a 10-15 minute search . 
  not by google , and not even in the bloody pdf you linked on the official site !, 
  if you were submitting a graduating paper for college you 'd fail because you did n't link your sources at the end of the paragraph , or even the whole * scenario 3 * section !, 
  ohhh you 'd even fail wikipedia . 
  huh . 
  so calling denmark `` stupid sweden '' was the youtube guy lying to me ?? 
  obviously we do n't like to be called as such , because there 's usually a `` retarded shithole '' sound to it , and also it brings flashbacks to yugoslavia , which we do n't like . 
  `` south-east europe '' is preferred .
