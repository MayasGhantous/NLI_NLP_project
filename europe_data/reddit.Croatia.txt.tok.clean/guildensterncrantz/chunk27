  but politically/culturally we 're balkans , as is whole of ex-yuga if you ask me . 
  mind you if you ask geographers , it 's not that clear , for example [ this division ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/balkan_topo_fr.svg/1400px-balkan_topo_fr.svg.png ) or [ this one . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/karte_suedosteuropa_03_01.png ) apparently they draw the northern edges on sava , or sava + danube , so we 're technically half-in . 
  * sangria is awesome . 
  mind you , we make it instead of buy it . 
  for our parties , we have a designated and eternal sangria-maker . 
  [ beautiful !, 
  ] ( https://supervalu.ie/image/var/files/recipes/imported/sangria_460x260.jpg ), 
  + hungary and romania ? 
  + uk and france . 
  + germany and france are complicated - they had a ton of wars , but apparently they like each other in the last 50 or so years ? 
  + uhh , the nordics . 
  i think it 's denmark and sweden , finland and denmark ( ? 
  ) , finland and sweden ( ? ) . 
  everybody loves norway . 
  come into eu , norway pls . 
  + balkans and ... balkans . 
  serbia against croatia , serbia and croatia and turkey ( ? ), 
  against various parts of bosnia , serbia against bigger parts kosovo . 
  turkey and greece . 
  slovenia is claiming it 's not balkans . 
  i heard that it started out as genuine trolling ( some people blame 4chan , because obviously they do ) , but then the satire-deficient saw it and overran the original rare pepes ? 
  i still do n't get what the `` two speed eu '' is about . 
  there are already `` two speeds '' in eu , when you look at just about any measure . 
  there 's no denying that certain countries do much better than others . 
  in fact i 'd argue that we have more than just * two * speeds here . 
  aside from that , you have the euro and schengen , and those are again already split . 
  do they mean to kick certain countries from euro more easily ? 
  delay others joining even more ? 
  or what ? 
  split the parliament , voting , or economic and military agreements ? 
  again , those are kinda vague already , as the article points out : `` small groups of countries can join forces in defence , or decide to pass a new law as a result of flexibility in the eu rulebook . '', 
  you know ... ** \u00c7 ** is actually growing on me . 
  seems like a fair compromise between the so-called purity/barbarism of people who use \u010d and \u0107 , or lack the \u0107 . 
  the little drunken tail looks more adorable than some little hat or ... half-hat ? 
  ( mind you i still think the umlauts look lamest . ), 
  a bit of irony : when we visited greece , our latin teacher had a running commentary in the bus . 
  it 'd go like :  [ on the right , some ruin , just a few columns left ]  `` aaaaand on your right , you can witness how hillbillies and barbarians ruined everything that used to be pretty ! '', 
  < creepy stalking time !  hm , [ snoopsnoo disagrees . 
  ] ( http://snoopsnoo.com/u/petique ) mostly posts here , but there is some on t_d ( statistically ) . 
  best comment in last few months is [ here . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/5bs976/this_man_is_gonna_save_america_today/d9qv4rw/ ) uh , the stuff about ukraine is complicated as far as i can tell , but on a quick [ comment search , ] ( https://redditcommentsearch.com/ ) i just found that `` russia did n't start a * full-scale war * against ukraine yet '' . 
  then there 's the [ clinton-soros stuff . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5p00lb/george_soros_says_theresa_may_will_not_last_and/dcnkecq/ ), 
  oh , the mines are getting cleared - but it takes time . 
  afaik there are several problems : we have no maps in regards to where they 've been laid ( so just mapping them took a while ) , a lot of them tend to be in difficult-for-machinery places like forests , ragged rocks and such , then even the floods can move them around a bit . 
  the last i heard of it was some report by the government that promised we 'll be finally done clearing them up by 2019 ( i take that with a grain of salt , because it 's our government - they get lost in spacetime ) . 
  in regards to safety , [ all the minefields ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/croatia_minefields.png ) are clearly [ marked ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/landmine_warning_sign_in_croatia.jpg/220px-landmine_warning_sign_in_croatia.jpg ) - you may see variations of that sign , in any case , `` mine '' = `` mines '' . 
  and all the hotspots for tourists were the first to be cleared , so the odds of you stumbling into a minefield while following regularly traveled/hiked paths are basically nil . 
  i suppose that you may end up in danger if you randomly go off-path in the middle of `` bumfuck nowhere , former battlefield '' . 
  and we do occasionally hear about someone dying from the mines , but all the cases i remember were the deminers themselves . 
  i do n't know much about serbia or bosnia , though , so take this with a grain of salt ~ what i heard about bosnia is that their situation is much worse , for sadly obvious reasons - war was worse there , and they 're poorer/less organized in removing their mines . 
  but afaik they mapped/put up signs around their minefields too , so you should be safe . 
  so far i 'd agree with you . 
  mind you , the subs i usually visit/lurk in are very focused around a particular topic or type of content - like for example srd , / r/photoshopbattles , r/asoiaf - and imo they 're pretty good at what they do , be it posting or the comment section . 
  / r/europe is much broader than that , so i think that by default there 'll be content that does n't interest this or that particular redditor . 
  but in general , the average comment here is pretty interesting , and same goes for people disagreeing with each other . 
  ( one nitpick i have so far is the occasional extra aggressiveness in downvoting/discussing whatever . 
  but not sure if that 's because of the sub structure , or europe being very salty at itself for the past cca 2500 years . ), 
  one question : those fads , like the cartoons , or nth biggest city , or `` x country vs civilized people '' that 's on the front page right now . 
  does it happen all the time ? 
  it seems that 3-4 of these fads ran through the sub in the past week . 
  what was it like before ? 
  ( it looks ok to me atm , but then again i would n't know about changes . ), 
  what gets me the most in regards to croatia is the `` but is it safe ?? '', 
  like , dude . 
  the war ended more than 20 years ago . 
  it 's safe enough to walk alone drunk at 3 am in every city/town/village i visited here . 
  and the question is usually asked by people from the west who live in huge cities where `` it is known '' you should avoid certain city blocks after nightfall - just in case . 
  the worst i 've ever heard of happening with some frequency is stolen cellphones/wallets if you leave your bag unattended ... usually in * turbofolk * bars . 
  ( but then again , i hold that you should avoid turbofolk bars for your own sanity . ), 
  [ shrug ] i definitely was n't subscribed , and do n't remember it ever showing up in my r/front . 
  but mind you , when i do venture out of specific subs ( r/asoiaf is most common in my case ) , i usually go to r/all , which happens to be fairly usa-centric ^ 1 as i said . 
  1 : jk , it 's cat and gif-centric . 
  joined the sub a week or so ago . 
  it 's a good break from the general reddit , which feels very usa-centered ( obviously it would , they 're the largest group here by far ) , feels almost like i found home on the internet again . 
  i just need to catch up on all the polandball and/or `` politbiro take potato , such is life '' memes \\ ^ ^, 
  ok ... why is this downvoted to oblivion ? 
  i can see people reading it as sarcasm . 
  but on the other hand , i can just as easily see it being an honest compliment - tone is difficult to read on the internet . 
  ( bloody hell even at first glance at posting history - first page or so - this redditor does n't sarcastically attack germany or even europe in general , in any way . ), 
  that 's why i used the wording of : big countries , small countries , stink eye . 
  my politicians will say `` yes , dear '' to whatever the stronger parts of eu , or even usa say ( assuming there 's no conflict there ) , regardless of how much sense it makes or how the general populace feels about it . 
  germany * alone * is 11.4 % of our exports and 15.5 % of our imports ... meanwhile we barely count as a blip there , unless it 's about tourism , which is one of the few things that 's keeping us afloat . 
  and no , this is n't really germany 's fault , and the people here do n't even resent them for it . 
  but pretending that facts like [ wealth , population , military , even surface area of country ] do n't largely influence the * practical * decision-making of the eu is just silly . 
  which brings us back to the main reason for euroskepticism here - the `` small fish '' feel like they 're getting `` offers they ca n't refuse '' , and you 're screwed either way : either you join the big guys and hope the policies wo n't harm you ( much ) , or you try to stay more independent , and it 's even worse because you completely sink in the globalized market that has behemoths like e.g. 
  china . 
  well to beat the dead horse a little more , the lack of cooperation/joint action when it comes to for example the refugees . 
  i see it like this : so people proposed fair-ish ( ? ), 
  quotas . 
  and by people , i mean `` the most powerful countries in eu giving stink eye to their weak/tiny fellows '' . 
  other countries do n't want those quotas , because they 're poor or have their own problems , or they do n't want many refugees period ( who may be economic migrants , depending on whom you ask or how you count ) , or whatever other reason . 
  then germany says `` we 're welcoming a ton of you !, 
  '' , or something that gets mistranslated as such among the refugees . 
  and that 's fine if germany is saying that for * itself * , they can do that as far as i 'm concerned . 
  but then a few million people stampede through south-east europe , and all of a sudden it 's a * common * european problem , and we 're supposed to defend the borders , despite the fact that we literally ca n't in terms of logistics , nobody even asked us what we really think about it , and nobody is sending proper aid . 
  hungary putting up fences is a problem , but then serbia and croatia not putting up fences is also a problem . 
  the general public is split between the extremes of sob-stories and `` let them all in , shame on you '' , and `` bloody hell why do n't you use tear gas and barbed wire '' , and meanwhile there 's little to no cooperation and agreement between the leaders . 
  so this may be an extreme example - eu usually does n't face a crisis on this scale - but it 's still worrying .
