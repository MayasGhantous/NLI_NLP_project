   the main stereotype ( according to other former yugoslav nations ) is that they are a lazy bunch . 
  * a dalmatian , a bosnian , and a montenegrin were competing on a 100-metre dash . 
  the dalmatian quit half-way in . 
  the montenegrin did n't even start . 
  * [ * the bosnian got lost .

  border dispute on the coast . 
  been going on for a while now . 
  it 's something along the lines : we have various legal claims to a bit of coast/sea ( bay of piran ) , i * think * our claim is better on paper , but then again slovenia is tiny and their access to sea is even tinier while we have more coast than we can settle with visiting germans ( for now ) so may as well give them an inch ... but then again , if we do that , insert `` muh rights '' etc etc. . . anyways , slovenia blocked our ascension to eu for a while because of that . 
  it boils down to a pissing contest for the most part . 
  so now other responsible ( international ) adults will decide on the issue . 
  you must prove your worth in eurovision first !, 
  some is laziness ... but i think some is also the cringe-factor , or even the `` aww that 's so adorably wrong '' factor . 
  in my case , mispronunciation is pretty common among people whose native language is n't slavic , and then you have the example of the [ dazzling grammatical cases . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5wg0zp/number_of_grammatical_cases_currently_in_use_in/ ) trying to get those correct is just too much pain , and when they 're wrong , the person just sounds like a kid . _ . 
  edit : and then on top of that , english-speakers in particular seem bad at pronunciation . 
  i 've decided to blame all the extra vowels - or strangled consonants - that seem to randomly pop up in english .

  what happens after donald , then ? 
  one for peace and one for ... idk , economic sciences ? 
  [ side-note to mods \u2661 ] ( http://www.geekynews.com/pub/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thor-hammertime.gif ), 
  in this case , that 's not how reddit really works . 
  it 's one thing for the sub to be flooded by ships or childhood cartoons , in which case i suppose the mods can/should intervene for a while , if only to slow down the `` karma-grabbing fad '' . 
  if you want to see more non-brexit posts , post them yourself . 
  or downvote if you think they do n't contribute . 
  if these posts are thriving , it 's because the sub finds them interesting . 
  ah , you mean you all actually do want your corrupt overlords out of the jail , you just have n't realized it yet ? 
  yea i ca n't really understand the example of donald . 
  apparently his voters were fighting against `` the system of elites '' that exploits them - makes them poor while the rich ones get richer . 
  and then they vote for the guy with a * gold-plated * hotel ? 
  the sorriest of the 99 % fighting against the 1 % by voting for the richest of 1 % ? 
  a lot of our `` blondes '' that are born blonde ( ish ) turn light/medium brown by the time they come to 20 's . 
  so they `` make themselves blonde again '' by dyeing their hair , sometimes just highlights ( which is partially related to why i see more female than male blondes ) . 
  what i think of when someone says `` nordic blonde '' rarely happens here . 
  apparently you count as a distinct type of southern `` blonde '' :p,

  eh , as far as i can tell , it 's just so that they can make europe look worse . 
  i 'm generalizing here , but it seems to me that socialism is still a dirty word to many americans , because * of course * if you have a state that meddles in things like health care , workers rights , education and co , you 'll end up with everyone being poor ( `` politburo take potato , such is life '' ) . 
  many of the european countries ( north-west-central europe more than the rest ) are both rich and they have some dirty socialism going on - and this shows that the usa system is n't truly the best in the world . 
  and adopting some of the eu system would mean less power and money for the powers that be of usa . 
  and since it 's much better for those white-collar thieves to blame the dirty immigrant mexicans for the problems in usa , and since they also have to make for example sweden look worse , why not blame the dirty muslim immigrants ? 
  tbh i think the serbian one is more inspired , he winks when you hover over the pic . 
  ours should do something too , then . 
  smirk ? 
  i think so , too . 
  it 's just the various nationalists arguing , because they think counting blood-cells is very important ( it gets extra ridiculous when you look at how much mixed blood the balkans tend to have ) . 
  tesla himself was n't interested in this us vs them mojo , but since that goes against the flag-waving narrative ... 
  mind you , then you also have the bored internet dwellers who just start the argument again for its popcorn value xd, 
  alternative opinions ? 
  so nitpicks/criticism , in decreasing severity : + uh , starting with 2:18 , maybe do n't use the circle with the uk flag ? 
  cause they voted to leave , which the skeptics are using as an argument that eu is falling apart . 
  + so at 0:30 , once you transfer from the problems/skeptics to the pro-eu sections , you start with croatia and the background music is so quiet for a few seconds that for a moment i thought my audio died . 
  this background music starting quiet and getting louder is ok , but i think you should start a bit louder ( it 's especially jarring after the fairly-loud problem parts ) . 
  + the language situation is a bit odd . 
  this is a mostly-english video , right ? 
  or at least , you 're assuming your audience knows english . 
  while i like that there are more languages than that in the video , perhaps add some proper eng-subtitles on them ? 
  + hmm , [ what does eu mean to you ? 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/qj3h-r8nuga?t=41s ) section may come off as too sappy . 
  the [ anti-war , going abroad , free movement , community ] parts feel appropriate to me , but a lot of the stuff in `` what does it mean ? '', 
  reads a bit like a handsome brochure designed in brussels , instead of something that people honestly think , even the pro-eu folk . 
  huh , apparently it 's because there are no `` official '' lyrics . 
  this goes for bih , spain , san marino and kosovo . 
  yeah ... 
  i can see trying to figure out which ones are salvageable , and which ones are so radical they 're a waste of time in a practical sense . 
  i can also see reaching out to the salvageable ones . 
  but trying to `` deradicalise '' the worst of them - maybe in some * ideal * world it 'd work , but doing ... what ? 
  chanting freedom values ^ tm at them ? 
  it 's laughable . 
  better use those resources to influence the younger/less radical ones before the lunatics get to them , if you 'll do anything at all . 
  ( aside from just steal money and make the country * look * safer , as happened here . ), 
  i think part of the problem is that whenever you try to speak a foreign language with some locals , they switch to english xd plus , the lack of widespread media in any other language . 
  my formal schooling when it comes to english rounds up to ... 13-14 years , and tackling a single order of the phoenix by j.k.rowling in early high school taught me more * actual language * than all that schooling combined . 
  school gave me grammar and some of the most important vocabulary . 
  everything else was subbed-tv , music , books , internet . 
  ( side-note : imo the countries that dub foreign media are making a terrible mistake . 
  subbing is faster , uses fewer resources , keeps the original acting untouched , and it even ends up teaching your people something important , without them complaining about `` school sucks ! '' ), 
  i always thought it sounds like a mix of old latin ( or , a bit slower italian ) and extra consonants ... ** h ** in particular , though i feel like there 's more k , s , r , t as well . 
  italian + a dash of something that 's more similar to slavic languages ? 
  anyways , it sounds great . 
  i love most of them . 
  it 's one win after the other , by the time i came to the end i was grinning like a loon , and then greece did me in x '' d, 
  * innocent polandball , i promise, 
  [ but does your box still has wet ? 
  it 's not so much `` giving people free stuff '' , as it is `` dangling the carrot juuuust out of reach '' . 
  i do n't know how other countries deal with the dynamic duo of corruption and incompetence . 
  here , it goes like this : you have the pm , the president , all their ministers , the whole judicial system , the works . 
  the best guess is that around 87 % of them are corrupt or incompetent or both . 
  soooo ... let 's say that we march in protest , take all of that down ( there 'll be the innocent 13 % going down with them ) . 
  but the problem is , every single one of them has an aunt , uncle , best man , and 128 cousins either working for the state at the lower levels ( that 's how they all hire and vote for each other ) , or working in banks , or education , medicine , oh and do n't forget that these godfathers ^ ^ cue & nbsp ; music are best friends forever with the all the biggest fish in media , industry , manufacture , * that person who 's keeping you employed and feeding the taxes . 
  * we call it `` the octopops '' . 
  and there 's basically no one who can make a 3d map of them all , who stole what and how bad was it , is this or that white-collar robber actually a net gain for the country because they employ a lot of people in our surviving industry and tourism , will we end up like the bloody middle east if we try to dismantle them ... not that anyone knows where to really start . 
  you 'd need non-euclidean geometry for that 3d map , perhaps also the higgs boson . 
  besides , us plebs , we do n't actually know all that stuff because it 's not our job to know it . 
  i bet that every person from norway also does n't know the intricacies of who 's the pirate friend of whom in their great population and complex social structure . 
  this is why we 're not the politicians or the investigators . 
  however , the politicians and investigators do know it ( at least better than we do , as i said , it 's non-euclidean ) , so that 's why eu tells * them * : `` clean mess or no gib euromonies ! '', 
  this might end up becoming a measure where that last stick is removed . _ . 
  [ eh , you all are special snowflakes ~ ] ( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/14/90/f4/1490f46852c5e03d8e25fbec3dc001d6.jpg ),
