  and then i 'm like : '' ... '' xd . _ . 
  oi , we 've been passive-aggressively arguing about the coast with slovenia * forever * . 
  the most that happens with that is mutual whining to whomever will listen , and jokes about them being tiny < 3 ( as for the break-up of yuga , that was a complicated situation that 's more similar to for example a bunch of german bundesl\u00e4nder deciding to become independent . 
  two established states like germany and denmark throwing shade is much different in practice . ), 
  but are n't we supposed to argue about borders in otherwise boring times ? 
  my amusement is [ purely innocent ~ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/xihhuqs.png ), 
  * assuming that other nationalists across eu do n't use the uk as a leading example . _ . 
  and i 'd agree with it being lose-lose . 
  sure , if the uk economy tanks now after they left , or eu uses the harshest possible penalties , i can see that scaring the break-eu folks . 
  but on the other hand , uk was a big part of eu in terms of gdp , trade , population , army , you name it . 
  so it 's debatable that having lesser ties with them is worth them `` no longer complaining about everything '' , especially since the rest of the countries bicker about stuff every other tuesday too . 
  and besides , i 'm doubtful about the harsh penalties that 'd `` show the rest of them '' . 
  it 'd only isolate uk in europe , and then they 'd turn to ... who ? 
  putin ? 
  nobody sober wants more of those two on our doorstep . 
  heh , but you 'd end up being `` doj\u010dland '' - just does n't have the same look to it :  the `` eu '' -  `` oj '' stuff happens because we basically have no diphthongs ( iirc eu , au , \u00e4u ) , that is , whatever you pronounce is what is written - ( almost ) always . 
  though to be fair , the german spelling rules fit into something like a single a4 page , can be memorized in a few hours . 
  english , on the other hand ... 
  i have no idea what 's going on with that spelling and i 've long since given up on figuring it out . _ . 
  most of the people i see here are at least skeptical of eu - no one denies that it has problems as it is now , though what exactly the problems are will differ . 
  however , the world has changed a lot in the last 50 or so years , so european countries standing by themselves , trying to get heard in the global economy and politics ... it 's like the difference between california negotiating with china and usa negotiating with china . 
  plus most of the pro-leave arguments that we saw from uk - your own papers and politicians - were n't exactly * complimentary * to the rest of the eu . 
  so , of course there 'll be salt . 
  \u0161 -  german `` sch '' \u010d -  german `` tsch '' \u0107 -  basically the same thing as \u010d , a bit softer ( do n't ask why , even we 're not really sure ) \u017e -  first sound in french jean \u0111 -  first sound in english jean ( there 's also `` d\u017e '' , which is the same thing but harsher , same issue as \u010d and \u0107 ),

  this performance reflects the ability of all three countries to generate steady prog - ress during periods in which they experi - enced slower economic growth . 
  poland , which had the highest growth-to-well-being coeffi - cient in 2015 , continued its strong perfor - mance and is in the fifth spot this year . 
  oh , just wait until our government hears this !, 
  `` see , i knew you were whining for nothing !, 
  more taxes now ! '', 
  ok this has gotten pretty long and philosophical ... 1 \\ . 
  in a lot of issues , there is no simple answer in `` who should get to decide what 's wrong and right '' . 
  so as generalization , i 'd say : ethics , logic and science ( because it 's the best we 've got ) . 
  yes , all 3 of them failed us at bad times . 
  but it sure beats going with `` my gut feeling '' . 
  there 's a big difference in shading between speaking out against a corrupt government , and speaking out against * easily * disproven quacks that harm people by spreading their ideas . 
  i understand why it can look like a slippery slope . 
  in this particular issue of anti-vaxxers , they had all the opportunity in the world to prove that their ideas are scientifically correct . 
  or to put it differently : the government is accountable to the people , and how it should work is a matter of constant debate . 
  you wo n't * debate * with your surgeon , claim that your `` voodoo spells '' or whatever nonsense can fix that tumor better than his medical science can ... meaning , you * can * claim that your nonsense is fact , but after it 's proven false , you 're done . 
  `` but what i disagree with is people not being able to decide about their kids '' . 
  look up [ herd immunity . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herd_immunity ) they 're not just harming their own kids , but * all of us * . 
  and as a side-note , i do n't think that any parent has the right to harm the health of their own kids , either . 
  same as all child abuse .

  i 've decided to blame the bald eagles and their first amendment !, 
  ^ ^ ^ ^ / s but seriously now , i 'm not sure/it 's complicated . 
  to be fair , a lot of our human history you had the powerful trampling over the freedom of speech , religion , choice and so on . 
  even in the many cases when it turned out that the `` unpopular opinion '' was true . 
  so you have these fears that outlawing this/that bit of freedom is not just immoral ( because freeedom ) , but that it 'll also hurt our progress as a society . 
  in regards to this specific case - anti-vaxxers - i think a large part of it is also the lack of trust in science ( `` maybe they 're wrong , or maybe the scientists are corrupt '' ) , or even the lack of understanding of science ( `` what 's the harm of my choice ? '' ) . 
  i guess that , when it comes to tolerating stuff that should n't be tolerated ( like the intolerant people , because they do n't share our `` all humans deserve human rights '' mojo ) , it 's probably a combination of this fear of lynching in the wrong direction , and people not appreciating the danger of the propaganda you mention . 
  a lot of these `` 100 % free '' proponents i meet have too much faith in humanity - they think that people will * obviously * not accept bad ideas , so no harm done . 
  which ... sometimes really fails . _ . 
  + they had a love-hate relationship with france for most of the history ? 
  not sure why . 
  i 've been told that the english are genetically programmed to sink french ships . 
  + gloomy weather , at least in the southern parts . 
  + the whole brexit thing is a mess . 
  i 've heard that a lot of the people who were for staying did n't feel like they need to vote , then it looks like the consequences of leaving were n't properly explained to the leave section . 
  also i heard there were outright lies in the campaign , like for example promising that the extra funds that went to the eu would be diverted into nhs , which magically turned into '' * maybe * it 'll go there '' after the deed was done . 
  + the industrial revolution . 
  thanks !, 
  wait , wait . 
  this attitude where `` words do n't matter , just shrug it off '' is wrong . 
  we 're not talking about school-yard bullies , though for the record i think that also counts as verbal/emotional abuse . 
  given circumstances , words can and do move whole nations and societies towards good or bad . 
  in that sense , every example of a bad ideology that started with only words - which is most of them , really , this is how ideas and movements spread - can say `` well whatever , i was just stating my opinion '' . 
  your private opinion can be whatever you want , but once it becomes words that go like , for example `` blacks are a sub-human race , i think we should enslave them '' , you 've crossed a dangerous line . 
   harmful ignorance is a problem of defining , would you like the biggest religion to dictate that you 're all spreading harmful ignorance like the non existance of a deity which will punish or harm all evildoers etc. , yeah , no . 
  we can argue about the existence of god , heaven and hell etc , all day long and never reach a definite conclusion . 
  i 'm talking about science here . 
  you ca n't argue the fact that vaccination is necessary for public health . 
  ( well , it * was * actually argued , and the scientific conclusion was that the anti-vaxxers are full of shit . ), 
  if your * opinion turned speech * is spreading false and harmful information in regards to health , then it is not covered under `` but my free speech , what 's the harm '' . 
  the harm is in the measles returning . 
  yeah , i see those two scenarios as well . 
  and i also think eu will sooner fall apart than grow closer together . 
  which is such a bad idea on a long-term/global scale . 
  this is n't the 1900 's when european countries were powerful and kinda self-sufficient ( well , by exploiting the colonies , but whatever . 
  1800 's , then ) . 
  all these nationalists seem to believe , or at least promise , that they can somehow turn the clock back to the old days when your market competition was pete from the next village , instead of behemoths like usa , china and similar ... ^ ( and that 's before we come to the incoming robot takeover . ), 
   you let people police one type of speech =  you allow others to do the same on topics you do n't agree with and you have eastern germany in a nutshell eh . 
  freedom is alright , but not at the point where `` your rights '' harm someone else in very definite ways . 
  so some kind of absolute freedom , where everyone can do as they want , would be a total anarchy where the strongest end up abusing the weak , which definitely removes rights like `` the freedom to not be abused '' from the weak . 
  it all ends up being illogical . 
  as an extension of that , free speech is * usually * alright , and many times it 's hard to draw the line . 
  but in general , when your free speech becomes * hate speech * , when it promotes violence towards others , or spreads harmful ignorance like these anti-vaxxers - to hell with that .

  i would n't know ... but now that i think about it , the last snow in dalmatia i heard of was when the kerum dynamic duo was ( not ) running things in split . 
  you all did n't clean up the new snow , apparently cause you expected it 'll melt , except it did n't , everything got frozen , people were falling over everywhere . 
  northerners made helpful instruction videos on the purpose of the shovel , and that kerum sister whatshername , she said something like `` pa \u0161ta idu marmontovom di se kli\u017ee , ima i drugih ulica u splitu ! '', 
  i think montenegro lol 'd at that . 
  this one is more industrial than usual , covers 3 different peoples ~ a dalmatian , a montenegrin and a bosnian were racing a 100 meter dash . 
  the dalmatian quit half-way .
