  [ 2 ] whyyy u do dis ? 
  hm ... `` yugoslavia , of which sr croatia was a part , had legalized the practice in 1952 based on a medical , eugenic or a legal indication . 
  in 1960 , a social indication was also allowed . 
  in 1969 , a rule that a commission 's approval was required for the termination of pregnancies within the first 10 weeks -- was rescinded . '', 
  for eastern block - as you say , we should look from country to country , but i found this on a quick search - '' ( ... ) a reliance upon abortion , in part because periodic shortages of birth control pills and intrauterine devices made these systems unreliable , ( ... ) '' so , * reliance * implies that it was at the very least widely available , which probably means it was legalized in some way ? 
  fwiw we do n't , but that 's because they 've been here `` forever '' . 
  as others explained , it translates best to `` faggot '' , though for whatever reason * , it 's used more often than in usa . 
  ------------------------------- * insults over here are usually way less tame than what i think is usual in usa . 
  we use `` jebiga/jebote '' the way the polish use kurwa , as basically interpunction ( closest translation would be `` fuck it '' ) . 
  `` fuck you '' is taken rather more cheerily here , too . 
  `` cunt '' is common instead of heavily offensive . 
  then there 's the thing with mothers - and them getting fucked by various ( including dogs - `` jebo ti pas mater '' ) , instead of them being yo mama so fat ( which is again tamer ) . 
  does n't mean we have anything in particular against the concept of mother . 
  also serbs have a creative one that never caught on here much - `` jebo je\u017ea u le\u0111a '' ( `` may you fuck a hedgehog 's back '' ) . 
  tl ; dr : we 're not exactly as progressive in terms of lgtb as some other progressives , but `` pederu '' is so old it 's at most a shade more insulting towards gays than the generic `` fuck it '' . 
  over here , it goes : globalism is a new-ish thing , therefore it 's against conservatism/old structures . 
  globalism is also against nationalism , so obviously nationalists do n't like it . 
  nationalists and conservatives are also the same people because to simply put it : every man/country for himself may have worked * before * - or at least , it used to be our dream ( muh independence ) , nobody is truly `` sovereign '' now . 
  ok , but you can see how the same might apply to some of our own elites ? 
  but that aside , i 'm talking about the american public . 
  so many of them view the world in pre and post-9 / 11 terms ... and while yes , that was afaik the biggest terrorist attack in terms of sheer numbers , my impression as a young teenager was `` this must mean that 30-40k people died '' . 
  then i checked , and it turned out that - no , it was 2997 . 
  and yet it seemed that the fear inspired was just slightly lower than hiroshima . 
  the point is n't in `` we should n't react to terrorism '' , the point is `` we should n't * overreact * to terrorism '' . 
  it 's like ... take 9/11 . 
  usa freaked out at that as if someone nuked new york out of existence . 
  this freakout then lead them to make/accept some very dubious decisions , both in internal security ( patriot act ) and external war on terror ( or was it war * of * terror ? 
  they look so similar ) . 
  point being : yes , the rising terrorism in the west is concerning , but it 's not a bloody war . 
  let 's all calm down a bit . 
  this sounds like the plot from hitchhikers . 
  remember the golgafrinchans , how they loaded all their useless folks on a ship and sent it off to space ? 
  and then the remaining useful people on the planet lived prosperously , up until they were wiped out from a virus * spread from un-wiped telephones * ? 
  what i 'm saying is , maybe we do n't rightly understand which vital purpose the daily mail has . 
  as an outsider : just please , please , whatever you do , do n't break the eu ( \u0ca5 \u0ca5 ) france ... s ` il vous pla\u00eet ? 
  ( what 's the equivalent of `` france pls '' ? ), 
  nationalists and conservatives tends to be the same people , anyways . 
  radical in terms of religion ? 
  as you can guess from my earlier comment , it 's not any group in particular . 
  we 're more religious over here than some of the central/west/even baltic euros , though some of it is a sort of counter-attack against the former communist party that discriminated religion . 
  ( it becomes more about * identity * than honest belief - more than is usual . ), 
  or : all sides will have their `` jehovah '' type idiots , as well as their fair-weather `` believers '' . 
  relations in general ... hoo boy . 
  not sure i want to touch that one ;d the tl ; dr would be - the most radical ones are those that are still mentally in the 90 's ( or lord help us , wwii ) , you can find them on all sides . 
  more specific ... separatists in bosnia seem to be the most `` charged '' group . 
  i think it 's similar around the different sides in kosovo , but i have less contact with them . 
  but what if i like dogs in theory - they 're good people - but i prefer to keep cats * precisely because they 're self-reliant psychopaths ? 
  * dogs need company and care . 
  cats only come around when they need a scratch , or feeding , or they 're simply endlessly greedy ( but their feelings do n't get hurt when i push them away , cause d'oh they 're psychopaths ) . 
  would you happen to have any polls that translate to similar radical islam , but from earlier ? 
  obviously isil is a more recent thing , but same-ish values were n't born yesterday . 
  asking because ( ethnic tensions aside ) bosniaks never came across as very radical/backwards to me , religion included . 
  it 's like ... `` yea they 're muslims , but on average they 're about as religious as we are , and we go to the church a few times a year '' . 
  for next time \\ ^ ^  vu\u010di\u0107u pederu !, 
  to be fair - blaming eu for our economic woes is a bit silly , we 're masters at screwing ourselves over . 
  remember vido\u0161evi\u0107 , the leader of hgk - same hgk who nobody knows the purpose of - buying stuffed polar bears with our tax money ? 
  eu did n't do that , and there are so many of the same ilk robbing us since time immemorial . 
  for heaven 's sake our former pm is at trial for corruption . 
  the euro crisis did hurt us even though we were n't in eu , sure , but that 's because our kuna follows the euro & co religiously , and we do most of the large borrowing in euro/usd anyways . 
  before that , it was the deutsche mark , so if it happened that the mark got into a crisis , same story . 
   1918 worst year of my life ; _ ;, 
  ok , this is a long one . 
  let me start with the dreaded eu funds . 
  poland has been the `` problem kid '' recently , and i see west/north euros - both politicians and random people - throwing the eu funds in its face . 
  as in , `` omg we pay for so much of your stuff , this is so unfair , and then you have the conceit to complain , why do n't you humbly shut up '' ( paraphrased ) . 
  now while we can debate about the quality of the current polish leadership - i do n't like them much either , they 're going about their complaints the wrong way at least - one of their ministers did recently point out a very interesting fact . 
  it goes : 1 . 
  so poland got 80 billion euros from the eu funds , some time frame i do n't remember . 
  10 years ? 
  `` poland should be humble about that . '', 
  however , in the very same time frame , germany * alone * sold 50 billion worth of products in poland . 
  if you add up the rest of eu , the amount of * profit * certainly far exceeds those 80 billion . 
  ... `` you ca n't sell anything to people who are dirt poor . '', 
  in conclusion : west/north euros are n't investing into east/south * because they 're charitable bleeding hearts . 
  * successful people do n't work that way , period . 
  ha , \u017di\u017eek has a bit to say about these eastern/balkan / `` those other people '' divisions in europe . 
  [ tl ; dr : it 's always to the east of where you 're standing ;d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge4sxlgiaga ), 
  following his earlier point - your random french do n't care much for estonia - same works for a lot of europe in general . 
  yes , we 're in the same relatively small continent , but my history and current state is much more affected by ottomans/turks , than for example the nordics . 
  ( of course the most relevant are my immediate neighbors , then germany , austria and italy , then usa/russia/china . ), 
  i 've seen many arguments from the brits - about how them leaving eu does n't mean they 're leaving europe , and while that 's true , `` europe '' without eu does n't really mean much . 
  now as to why i 'm much more pro-eu than against it ( while acknowledging it has flaws that need fixing ) : i do n't believe the world/humanity progressed as much as it may have seemed 10-15 years ago . 
  on one side , this is the most prosperous and peaceful age in history , but on the other hand the most relevant non-eu politicians - mostly elected politicians , * which is telling * - still behave in a `` dog eat dog '' manner . 
  tl ; dr : if the whole thing splits apart now and it 's every man for himself , i may as well dig out the old tanks , * just in case * . 
   those who flee should be deported by not complying with the european authorities . 
  yes , they should , but that 's not what happened . 
  i assume that nobody sane wants to stop people who are legitimately fleeing from war . 
  ( those that flee from poverty , well that 's a different case entirely . ), 
  so - many of them come into greece/italy/etc . 
  they want to move further into europe . 
  they refuse to be id 'd . 
  how is that in any way * legal * ? 
  distributing them legally through countries would be one thing , eu countries having to build literal razor wire fences to stop them , or just playing dumb `` hot potato '' with them ( as we did ) is something else . 
  and obviously there 's resentment because merkel invited them into germany ( * that 's her right * , as far as i 'm concerned ) , then said to balkans to let them through , but once the wave became too large , started pressing that we defend the borders/register them . 
  ( even serbia , which is n't even in eu , thus making the situation even more absurd . ), 
  meanwhile , they do n't want to be id 'd because they know it 's easier to deport them to the point-of-registration country like that . 
  so you end up with this ridiculous situation where countries that never invited the refugees that want to reach germany/sweden/etc need to keep refugees that want to reach germany/sweden/etc . 
  it 's not that simple . 
  croatia for example , we 're one of the countries that actually volunteered to increase our quota , from the one first proposed . 
  and it 's not some big number of people we could n't find jobs for , some 2000 or similar - quotas take into consideration how much you can take .
