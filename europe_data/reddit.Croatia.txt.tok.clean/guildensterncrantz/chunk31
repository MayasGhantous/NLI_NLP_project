  and now the spd is leading , which means that germany seems to want * more * of the `` left-ish '' stance on immigration ? 
  ( as you can probably tell , i really do n't follow politics all that much . ), 
  [ there are alternative sides around that debate . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsbt5eqt348&amp;t=1s ) it 's a pretty short video in itself , but tl ; dw : demographics are way more complicated than `` smart west = responsible '' and `` poor east/south = irresponsible '' . 
  there are several stages that all societies go through , in regards to [ high birth , high death rate -  ... -  low birth , low death rate ] . 
  at some point in that transition , you get few deaths and many births , which leads to a population explosion . 
  west finished with that , the so-called developing countries are still in the process ( think baby boomers ) , and they 're actually going through the phases faster than we did , at least partially because of better technologies and international aid . 
  to my stupefied surprise , both are half-half ... depending on who you ask . 
  that is , when it comes to politics , culture etc , people mostly count ex-yuga , albania , romania and bulgaria as balkans . 
  [ but if you ask geographers , ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/karte_suedosteuropa_03_01.png ) the northern boundary is so\u010da -- vipava -- krka -- sava -- danube . 
  so i had the oddest identity crisis when i found out :o, 
  and you 're not even , if you count croatia and slovenia . 
  ... which you should n't , slovenes get salty at that :p but seriously now , why does it under-perform ? 
  dull teachers , students not caring , as is in my case ? 
  huh , your system sounds kinda similar to what i know of germany . 
  we have elementary 8 , high school 3 or 4 ( 3 is mostly the vocational schools , everything else is 4 ) , then college we used to have 4 , now it 's 3 +2 by the bologna process , which is a bit of a disaster here . 
  afaik the goal of bologna was to shorten a lot of college education from 4 to 3 years , because officials looked at colleges and realized it 's mostly bs theory , little practical work , which means people waste extra time on nonsense they wo n't need for jobs . 
  ( well , most of them . 
  think people who 'll organize the factory into running , instead of teach at colleges , invent the warp drive , cure cancer etc. ), 
  * of course * us idiot balkans took that to mean they should n't shorten to 3 , but lengthen to 5 years of ... more dusty theory . 
  eh , it 's not even so much the `` buying '' from what i see , buying jobs yes , school - nobody really cares about your scores . 
  elementary school is peanuts and nobody ever fails . 
  high school is harder ( also a lot depends in which one you are ) , but then again by that time all most kids want is the bare passing grade , which is again easy with most teachers - and people still rarely fail a whole grade . 
  you cram without understanding for high school finals ( matura ) , sign up for some college that does n't have a lot of math , or if it does , it 's the bare-bones passing again . 
  and of course , you promptly obliviate anything you managed to learn as soon as you 're out . 
  well no , this is college level ( mostly because of the integrals and the subject matter , fourier transform of signals ) . 
  but the math that i remember from high school , all the functions in particular , were n't much easier than that :1, 
  huh . 
  estonian kids like learning [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zzpoolx.png ) without even knowing why it 's supposed to be useful , and all narrated by a dull voice that could put the summer sun to sleep ? 
  i do n't know about the rest of the countries , and when it comes to croatia , this is more my observations than some kind of organized statistics ~ we get tons of math in school , from the beginning of elementary . 
  iirc after croatian ( grammar , literature ) it 's the 2nd most prominent school subject , and by the time you finish high school , you have 11 or 12 years of math under your belt , and even the majority of colleges require it in some fashion . 
  it 's even one of the 3 obligatory subjects for high school diploma . 
  the problem is more in the teachers and `` popular opinions on math '' . 
  not that the teachers do n't know the actual * math * , but as a general rule i saw in my schools and from everyone i know , the teachers make it so hopelessly `` boring and pointless '' . 
  for example , we start learning trigonometry , and we jump into the equations immediately , without the teacher remembering to tell us why we are learning it in the first place ( for example , it 's used in radar , signals etc etc ) . 
  i learned more math from one year of college than the preceding 12 years of elementary + high school put together . 
  in my case , it 's because the teacher bothered to start us on integrals by asking `` so how do you calculate the surface area or volume of irregular shapes ? 
  you know that the natural world is n't made of neat cubes , right ? '', 
   that you give a damn about your customer . 
  why is this necessary ? 
  do n't get me wrong , the service industry should be polite and helpful , if their help is needed beyond just the money exchange ( grocery store , do n't need them , buying a pc , * maybe * need them ) . 
  but i came there to buy whatever as fast as possible , not make a new friend . 
  what 's the point of these fake cheery smiles and greetings , if they 're just a part of the job and everybody knows it 's fake ? 
  maybe it 's something along the lines : murder is rare ( ish ) and extreme , and showing it on tv wo n't necessarily inspire kids to go out and murder irl people ? 
  while showing boobs - for goodness sake , these teenagers might figure out it 's ok to go out and fondle some real ones :o, 
  huh , i thought that was sweden . 
  ( mind you my source is srd and that dank meme war sweddit had with t_d . ), 
  this was a time before google maps , so for putting literal arrow signs between the rialto bridge and st. mark 's square , thank you venice !, 
  ~ the navigationally challenged, 
  i had a vague impression of leukocytes being `` the white cops in my blood '' for the longest time :d, 
  i suppose it depends on where you 're from . 
  in general i see a lot of doomsday hysterics from usa , and my extra-right ( not exactly alt-right , more like a lite version ) folks are also trying to scare people with `` the muslim horde invading , look at what 's happening to germany ! '' ... 
  but then the rest of us remember that germany accepted around a million immigrants ( or more ? 
  it was a million last i looked ) , and that germany had 80 million people on its own before that . 
  1 vs 80 does n't look exactly right for `` sharia law '' to me . 
  i mean , sure , both are just units . 
  ( well , the meter actually has to do with the speed of light , which is n't arbitrary in any way , but fine . ), 
  it 's about the units within the system . 
  you can memorize [ this ] ( https://nesciowriters.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/units.jpg ) in a couple of hours and you 're set for life , you just change the name of the unit from for example milliliter to millimeter and that 's that . 
  this is because the system makes sense . 
  hell , even though neither celsius nor fahrenheit are the standard units ( that 's kelvin ) , celsius makes way more sense to me because water freezes at 0 and boils at 100 , which is stuff you meet as a small child . 
  meanwhile , 1 foot is 12 inches , 1 yard is 3 feet , 1 mile is ... 1760 yards ? 
  5280 feet ? 
  63360 inches ? 
  you might as well say that 1 mile is `` 63360 potato units '' . _ . 
  poor mountain rescue service , everywhere ( . _ . ), 
  yeah , if it was part of the same ideological group doing hate-bonery things , would n't they also target the rest of v4 ? 
  actually , poland and hungary seem to get in clashes with that lot more often than czechia and slovakia . 
  hehehe , and our politicians never fail to take credit for it . 
  plot twist is , most of our hydro is quite a bit older than their political careers ... they 're literally taking credit for what `` those bad , no good yugocommunists '' did xd, 
  errr ... southern europe , welcome to eastern europe ? 
  or the other way around ? 
  hey !, 
  we had many long discussions on what is and is n't central europe in these posts !, 
  even discussions on whether central europe exists at all . 
  \\* shakes fist at chicken-stealing ancestor * \\* at least you could have stolen from hungarians !, 
  do n't know if this applies to ukraine , but here ( osijek ) , from what i remember ( i was a kid ) ~ actually , things work out surprisingly normal . 
  you 'd think a country at war would be apocalypse , no ? 
  but it 's not , not really . 
  first , not all parts are affected , and this does work for ukraine . 
  so the parts that fighting avoids , well they 're in a raised state of alarm ( just in case fighting does spread there ) , and they 're dealing with a lot of refugees , plus there 's the economic and logistical pressure . 
  the parts that are under attack ... a lot of people run away , especially those that ca n't fight ( women , children , old , sick ) . 
  of those that are obliged to stay , it was n't just soldiers and cops for us but , civilians who do the * vital jobs * were also under some kind of military obligation : a certain number of - from doctors to power-generation folks to even postmen , they have to stay . 
  the state says so , right , they 'd be deserters too if they ran for it . 
  mind you , the line between soldier and civilian gets a bit blurry , everybody - every house - had an ak-47 , `` just in case '' . 
  ( thankfully we never had to use ours . ), 
  and tied to that , people somewhat naively think that war is `` soldiers ' business '' . 
  ehh , the organized fighting itself , sure , but civilians not being at war is n't really true . 
  these doctors who are stitching up the wounded , what are they , if not at war ? 
  same for the rest who keep everything running , from power to food . 
  also , all sorts of civilians sign up to be soldiers - volunteers - because army itself ca n't keep up in numbers . 
  shelling - you have the siren alarms for when it happens . 
  so everyone takes shelter , mostly in basements . 
  then , i remember we put that big brown sellotape on windows , so that they do n't break from the shocks . 
  also , around our [ bus/tram pit stops ] ( http://arhiva.dalje.com/slike/slike_3/r1/g2009/m04/x213199744239223688_3.jpg ) , there were big sand-bags , up to shoulder-height or further . 
  patchwork shelters for people caught outside . 
  these shells , well whomever was throwing them - they did n't have a very good aim , i 'd say . 
  cause they were falling all over the place , civilian suburbs included . 
  finally , big part of the reason the place keeps running ~ well , you know how in normal times , people bicker about everything under the sun ? 
  and they do n't have much to do with each other , like , when 's the last time you said more than `` good day '' to that anti-social neighbor 4 houses down ?
