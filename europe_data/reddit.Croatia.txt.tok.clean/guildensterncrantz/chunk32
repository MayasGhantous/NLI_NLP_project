  anecdote from my street , said neighbor 4 houses down got a shell-to-roof , that is , his roof got basically blown off . 
  and he did n't wait for the politicians or the responsible organizations to fix his roof . 
  everyone from the street chipped in to buy new tiles and beams , dozen people came to actually do the physical job of fixing that roof - and it was fixed , in like 10 days . 
  and that 's how people go through a war . 
  but but  hrvat je tat ? 
  & nbsp ; ps . 
  why is that even a thing ? 
  do n't tell about piran , it 's older than that dispute . 
  what 'd we do ? 
  boomerang effect , i assume . 
  at least it happened with our commies . 
  it 's one thing to teach people that excess religiosity is stupid/backwards , or to let the power of faith die away naturally , it 's something else entirely to forbid it . 
  you only create martyrs like that , and seeing the many ways in which commies sucked in general , well - `` that 's got ta mean the other guy is right , right ?? '', 
  also , given that both soviets and yugos had the pan-slavism thing going on , which translated to denial or dismissal of different ethnicities - or their absorption in the biggest one - well , the faith got extra tied with cultural/ethnic identity . 
  yeah ... it 'll take a lot of time to fix this mess . 
  iirc bosnians are the champion class clown in ex-yugo . 
  and our national pastime is grousing about everything . 
  if we could connect that to power-generators , we 'd have enough electricity for whole balkan and further . 
  we mock you because you 're a neighbor , and i fancy i can feel an air of smugness coming down from triglav - occasional prickle should help that smugness not become even more insufferable . 
  as for bad intentions , i rather doubt you did n't have them . 
  as if we need more salt on our most recent ( in a long line of ) disasters . 
  go on , tell hungarians they 're actually slavs , see how that 'll go . 
  also , [ better map . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gll0m9y.png ) oh look , austria and czechia , `` what a great difference '' . 
  yep , you just do n't do humor , janez . 
  do n't you have fangirling to do over austria , hoping senpai will notice you for the first time in your existence ? 
  see ? 
  and that was n't even the meanest i could pull out against you . 
  as i said , you 're no good at humor . 
  over here , we 're way better off than bosnia , but we have the * decency * not to `` laugh '' at their economy . 
  here , tell us how very oppressed you are by big power russia , that works to activate the underdog-sympathy . 
  bring that awesome cheese i hear you 've got . 
  do n't deny shots of rakija . 
  so , slavic cultures that were more affected by roman-germanic cultures for more than a millennia than by fellow and often very distant slavs are supposed to ... have more in common with these slavs they have n't seen for a 100 years , than with their geographical and political neighbors ? 
  you really think that for example czech and slovenians have more in common with ukranians and russians , than with austrians and italians ? 
  i 'd have reservations , and this is n't because i have n't met cool roma or i believe in any kind of genetic nonsense or whatever . 
  but ~ it 's the attitudes . 
  roma * are * discriminated or at least viewed with suspicion , and we can discuss why that happens until we 're blue in the face ( was it the chicken or the egg ? 
  ) , but the fact is that there are unfortunate attitudes . 
  so , i 'd need to think whether i 'd want my grandchildren to struggle with that , assuming that they end up - looking visibly roma . 
   aha , arizona ? 
  haha . 
  my favorite wild west shopping of the early 2000 's :d mind you , the times we shopped in hungary and bosnia have passed by now , nowadays it seems to me we have more shopping malls with every type of wares than we have people that 'll buy all that stuff . 
  and well , we were passing through on our way back to osijek , so \u00af \\ \\ _ ( \u30c4 ) _ / \u00af, 
  possible yeah , confusing christian/catholic . 
  apparently only 60 % approve of these infidel atheists anyways , you might be onto something . 
  would be fun to see `` how would you approve of the orthodox ? '', 
  from the other thread , we 're more tolerable than usual of the muslims , but you know , those 3 have specific meanings here :p, 
  hm , but our biggest minorities are - serbs , by far , then it 's bosnians , but bosnian non-muslims are more common . 
  so basically , whites who happen to be christians . 
  and our approval for christian marriage is bigger . 
  maybe it 's because it 's a weird question ? 
  as in , who knows how people answer/what goes through their heads ... race is n't much of a thing here , even the roma who are arguably a different race as roma/gypsies first , `` non-white '' a distant second . 
  so some people give the wrong answer intentionally or because they 're confused . 
  \\  be almost 100 % white \\  have less than 90 % approval for relationships with whites \\  ???? 
  you know , i 'm warming up to the idea that some 10 % or more people answered ne because `` i 'm not comfortable with my children having relationships , period . '', 
  ah , shopping around br\u010dko , and as for the rest , unfortunately only passing through , making short-ish pit-stops . 
  almost convinced them to take an afternoon-trip to sarajevo , but no cigar ; - ;, 
  pardon me , but in my opinion you have a very strange way of looking at europe . 
  and i think that if anyone should know better , then it 's us euros - how fortunes can change , sometimes rather drastically . 
  that still does n't mean that those who are in misfortunate states right now are n't european - they still share the common culture , language , history , hell they 're even within the geographic borders . 
  geography becomes debatable on the edges , like turkey and caucasus , but that does n't work for ukraine . 
  i mean , if kiev is n't european , then i do n't know what is . 
  but are they bosnian postmen ? 
  that 's ... not how it works . 
  i know that borders of europe are arbitrary , but they 're not so arbitrary that you can toss out countries according to their gdp . 
  by that measure , ireland only `` became '' europe in the last several decades , us yugos were somehow `` more '' european than a lot of the warsaw pact and so on . 
  and what the hell , to make the gdp/hdi/etc requirement more absurd , i know australia is part of eurovision , but they 're not actually europe . 
  tbh it 's annoying and corny , but [ i have to ~ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtga0jvhp2a ), 
  bosnians come to slovenia for work , and slovenians go to bosnia to find their fathers . 
  hehehehe . 
  heh , well at least you 're listening  and to be fair , it 's not like i can boast about my detailed knowledge of americas . 
  usa i know plenty about ( you lot just `` can not into irrelevance '' :p ) , but if you asked me about how exactly canada came to be , or even worse the south american countries ( with the exception of brazil ) , i 'd draw a blank . 
  i expect europe will be even worse than that because we have a few dozen languages , 4-5 religions and around 3000 years of history behind it all . 
  in the shortest way i can put it ... 
  i think europe 's greatest strength and problem is that we 're packed like sardines here . 
  drive 100-400 kilometers , you 're in a different country with a different language and history . 
  and we 're way too stubborn to assimilate into each other ( most recent large attempt - 60 million people died ) . 
  so while i think it 'd be neat if we were as big and strong as your america , it 's way too late for it . 
  and considering everything that 'd be lost in said assimilation , i feel that it 's not worth it . 
  for balkans , hmm . 
  i mentioned rome , constantinople , a-h and ottomans . 
  aside from religion , another thing is alphabet . 
  these two maps : [ alphabet ] ( http://www.eurfedling.org/maps/alphabets_europe.jpg ) , [ religion ] ( https://churchpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/traditional-religions.png ) - they tell a story , because they show , to a limited extent , who was under which influence . 
  so you can use it a a quick-and-dirty cheat sheet for remembering `` who 's who '' . 
  see , but that 's the problem . 
  before 1918 , with the exception of bosnia , we really had almost nothing to do with each other . 
  independents duchies/kingdoms of serbia and croatia , with different/shifting borders tho ( serbia was more south than today , then lots of bosnia was croatia ) . 
  croatia joined hungary in 1102 , then later on the habsburgs . 
  we struggled over the coast with venice/italy often , and ottomans gutted us , though in the end we pushed them back to our modern-ish borders ( never got back the bosnian parts ) . 
  our cultural/political/economic / religious spheres were rome , budapest and vienna . 
  meanwhile , serbia stayed independent longer , fell under ottomans , in the meantime migrated north ( vojvodina was much more hungarian before , also see the kosovo issues ) and all over the place ( hence their diaspora in croatia for example ) . 
  they regained their independence in 19th century , unlike us ( though we were divided on whether we want it at all ) . 
  before ottomans , their political/cultural/economic / religious sphere was ... well , the byzantine empire . 
  so even in the very basics , you had a thousand years or more of rome/constantinople and austro-hugarian/ottoman empire dividing us . 
  bloody hell it looks like we did n't even come to balkans together , iirc serbs came earlier . 
  then southern poland , before the final migration - [ look . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/white_serbia_white_croatia01.png/800px-white_serbia_white_croatia01.png ) so , we 've had a really , really long history here , with different invades , influences , established ethnicity , institutions and all that stuff . 
  saying that we 'd be all the same if it was n't for the in-modern-times irrelevant issue of religion is ... uninformed , at best . 
  as far as we can tell from historical evidence , croats never called themselves serbs , and serbs never called themselves croats .
