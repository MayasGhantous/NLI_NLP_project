  if we 'll talk culture , precisely because of these invaders/unions , our coastal folk is waaaay closer to italians than serbs - obviously , too many mountain ranges dividing them , little common history . 
  so i looked up foreign investments in croatia - by country . 
  and there was the usual crew , austria , germany , hungary , also netherlands , though i personally heard of their firms doing stuff here so it did n't surprise me . 
  [ but also , for some reason , luxembourg . 
  ] ( http://www.aik-invest.hr/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/graf-zemlje-eng1.png ) should i be suspicious about that ? 
  for what it 's worth , recently we had salty reddit slapfights with slovenes around that ridiculous border dispute . 
  and i got ta say , arguing with them just is n't the same . 
  do n't know if that 's because their banter skills are n't up to par , or they do n't know which buttons to push , whatever . 
  y' all remain my favorite people to slapfight with . 
  close second are brexiters . 
  pa sam pretpostavila da je ovo `` more of the same '' . 
  [ exhibit . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6duphu/literacy_rate_in_the_kingdom_of_yugoslavia_1931/ ) a i slovenci niti su imali rat , niti su si dopustili onda da ih tijekom rata `` veliki patrioti '' oplja\u010dkaju u lo\u0161oj privatizaciji . 
  the people in knin who tried to say and wear fascist symbols ? 
  arrested . 
  thompson 's concert in slunj ? 
  we 've had a keruffle around that in the last few days , there have been charges flying . 
  and the situation around thompson is awkward and complicated , because of very long and awkward reasons . 
  his thing is that he 's arguing that the controversial zds greeting should be disconnected from the fascist wwii regime because it 's older than that , and that the fascists stained it for sure , but the real meaning is just patriotic . 
  my opinion is that it 's way too late for that ( think how deutschland \u00fcber alles was stained ) , but one of the reasons why it 's even a matter of debate is that the fascists used all sorts of historical symbols , and yet we 're not abandoning those . 
  like our currency , or our old checkers coat-of-arms . 
  there 's been a debate on banning all symbols of totalitarian regimes . 
  funny thing , many of the people who jak the loudest against the fascist stuff wo n't like it when all the commie stuff is forbidden as well . 
  and the rest of my comment ? 
  the lack of anything binding us before 1918 ? 
  see , we did n't decide to build yugoslavia because we suddenly realized we 're actually the same people . 
  we built it because there 's safety in numbers ( why does this sound so familiar ? ), 
  and we figured pan-slavism is a neat thing , `` wo n't it be better if we 're united with fellow slavs ? '', 
  it failed utterly , * twice * . 
  because it turned out that our different traits and interests were n't reconcilable . 
  traits like economy and previous infrastructure , for example , much more relevant than the simplistic narrative of `` religion '' . 
  interests like `` who 's gon na pay for all the stuff '' and `` who gets to rule '' . 
  i honestly do n't understand why i should care to `` make myself one '' with people who were largely irrelevant for most of my history , and without even economic cookies for my trouble . 
  here , we 're trying to export more to germoney and similar , because said countries will buy our stuff for a much higher price . 
  we 're buddying up with usa because usa has a very large army , and they were either neutral or helpful so far . 
  and so on . 
  eh , i felt a strong degree of closeness and familiarity in prague as well . 
  in many ways , arguably more closeness than in bosnia - sure i * understand * bosnians while i do n't the czech , but the way the place looked and appeared to function is more similar . 
  i mean , water is wet , we have closeness to czech because we were in same austro-hungary for ages and we 're fellow slavs . 
  even more ridiculously , zagreb looks more like similar to vienna/budapest than it does to split . 
  even the mentality of northern croats is - i think - more similar to southern hungarians than the coastal croats . 
  so ... what does that mean and what should be done about that - if anything ? 
  my armchair analysis is that yuga fell apart because , along with the failing political significance and shitty economy - we did n't * respect * each other . 
  not our differences , not our heroes and villains , not our problems , not our capabilities , not even our identity . 
  call me back in 50 years , and we 'll see where we 're at . 
  croats adn slovenes were pretty salty at a-h in 1918 as well , nowadays all sides established a common narrative , mostly apologized for the wrongs , and we 're a-ok . 
  but we have ongoing beef with serbia ... slovenia 's been annoyingly snotty too . 
  we have actual - arguable - reasons to dislike them . 
  we do n't really for those 4 groups in the poll . 
  and based on what i noticed among the people ( so to speak ) , literally no one minds the chinese keeping their shops for example . 
  they keep to themselves ( do n't integrate ) sure , but not a single problematic peep from them ... they 're taken as these weird but quiet and hard-working people . 
  blacks , the rare ones we get , well for example i met this cool and funny dude from namibia , * studying medicine * . 
  it 's not like they 're building ghettos . 
  then bosnians do like half of our construction work xd and besides , our results are in the `` whatever , ok ? '', 
  range , not the `` omg i really , really like them !! '', 
  face-to-face interactions ? 
  they 're mostly alright . 
  but country-to-country ? 
  ehh , depends . 
  a less-known fact is that montenegro also warred against us , they made up a lot of the crew that shelled dubrovnik . 
  and yet , i do n't know of anyone that 's salty at montenegrins , and politicians are also largely friendly . 
  bosnia ... bosnia has 3 minds about everything . 
  serbia , well that 's a clusterfuck . 
  we ca n't agree to the most basic facts around what happened in the 90 's . 
  and i 'm not just talking politician 's pissing contests , but supposedly more-progressive redditors telling me that serbia did n't go to war with croatia . 
  it works out similar to russia claiming it 's not at war with ukraine presently . 
  so , * compromise * around many of those issues is completely unacceptable to us . 
  and there 's a question of * necessity * too . 
  as in , people are encouraged to make nice if they have to make nice . 
  [ our export destinations in 2015 . 
  ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/hrv/show/all/2015/ ) those 5 % ... honestly , not worth the `` compromise '' . 
  so were and are the other dialects that were n't made into the standard language because they were n't close enough to the \u0160tokavski that 's spoken in much of bosnia and serbia . 
  and reading literature from longer ago in either of the 3 dialects we have is hard for me today ... and when i look at the differences , most of them seem to come from the intentional standardization and `` bring this thing closer together '' . 
  a process which is being undone in the last 25 years . 
  anyways . 
  ex-yugo , same as everywhere , has the dialect continuum . 
  yes , that does include slovenia and macedonia , people who live near borders of those understand slovenian and macedonian way , way better than i do . 
  ( those are definitely foreign languages to me . ), 
  and albanian is completely foreign to the rest . 
  so , aside from the dialect continuum , the republics that made yugoslavia , what do they have in common ? 
  culture ? 
  ehh , by that measurement , dalmatia should be part of italy . 
  history before 1918 ? 
  not even close , if we ignore bosnia , macedonia and montenegro , which came to be as countries much later . 
  ( though for macedonia , bulgaria lays a stronger claim , not us yugos . ), 
  religion , spheres of influence we leaned towards ? 
  nothing . 
  tell that to the irish , will you ? 
   we are the same people separated by greed , and religion . 
  and 1300 years of history ? 
  do you care about serbian history ? 
  its heroes , its villains , the culture and institutions and tales and relationships the same history built ? 
  do you care about greeks and russians because they 're somewhat friendly nations to you ? 
  i do n't . 
  because all that does n't apply to me . 
  at most , i have a degree of intellectual curiosity , but that extends no further than curiosity i 'd have for most nations that do n't matter much in the grand scheme of things . 
  bloody hell i know american/german/italian / a-h history way better , because those do matter for either my history or my present . 
  did you read stories by ivana brli\u0107 ma\u017eurani\u0107 in elementary school , because they 're nice stories and she 's * your * writer , did that affect your development in childhood ? 
  how similar are we really , then ? 
  the west does n't give 3 shits about any of us , as long as we do n't make the west look awfully incompetent , and do n't create a disruption in terms of economy or refugees .
