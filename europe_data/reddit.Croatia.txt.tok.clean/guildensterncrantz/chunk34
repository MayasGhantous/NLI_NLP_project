  they do n't care , because they have no reason to care . 
  put together , we 're somewhat bigger in population than romania . 
  we 're not exactly poor ( well , there are differences among ex-yugos , but nobody is africa-level ) , but we do n't have that much potential - small population , difficult terrain , barely any internal resources worth mentioning . 
  yugoslavia ... one of the reasons it stayed together was the external pressure , dipshits to the east , dipshits to the west , us deciding to be the buffer zone . 
  once soviets fell , nobody cared anymore ( the non-aligned movement lives to this day , and it 's about as relevant as the african union ) , economy was shit , we were tired of tolerating each other 's bullshit , that artificial `` brotherhood and unity '' nobody really bought melted away . 
  the rest is history . 
  if you 're anything like us , you barely have any blacks or asians , and the rare ones that live here - i never once heard of them making any problems . 
  muslims mostly mean bosnians and albanians here , not the radical lunatics from the middle east , so that probably affects our `` whatever , ok i guess '' . 
  i 'd be a bit weird to think very badly of the guys that keep their bakeries open 24/7 and therefore save you when you 're starving drunk at 3 am . 
  jews ... eh , do n't have that much of them either , and same as blacks and asians , they do n't make much trouble . 
  heh , i do n't think so . 
  the [ sheave ] ( https://awoiaf.westeros.org/images/8/8f/the_eyrie-tn.jpg ) looks about [ the same ] ( https://roaminroeck.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/dsc_0705.jpg ) , tho ' ps . 
  try to find the [ ossuary ] ( https://ssl.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/i0000mb1vssgu4js/s/650/650/angier-1209-meteora-greece-6513.jpg ) if/when you go there . 
  i feel like vale should be greece ~ they have about equally high mountains , indented coast , also i * think * the irl inspiration for eyrie was [ meteora . 
  ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=meteora&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewj5o5cxkndvahwqj5okhdmoaxsq_auicigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818 ) side-note : meteora is so awesome , if you can only visit one place in greece , honestly skip the acropolis ( as hard as that decision is ) and go to meteora . 
  those pesky italians tried to get their mitts on our city of king 's landing many times , no can do ~, 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  everyone and their grandmother knows that greece is special , whether it 's because of the bits of ancient culture you managed to preserve , the language and alphabet , or even your geography which forces you to be a maritime culture ( unlike most of the rest of balkan ) . 
  and afaik our neighbors do n't call it `` greek influence '' but `` byzantine influence '' . 
  and this byzantine influence appears as relevant to their nation/culture building as rome/vatican does for us . 
  that 's not to say that greece is strongly tied to its balkan neighbors now , but ... 
  i do n't know , have you visited some of these countries ? 
  i have n't regretfully , but i did visit budapest , vienna , prague , plus i 've been all over greece . 
  to me , greece felt * very * unfamiliar , with perhaps the exception of mentality ( your people 's temperament seems similar to our coastal folk ) . 
  on the other hand , the former a-h cities felt like a copy of my northern cities . 
  so , if the influence of the now long-dead a-h is so visible in former a-h ( ditto for italy and our coast ) , would n't something similar work for former byzantine empire and its satellites , plus whatever traces the ottomans left ? 
  but of course , that all depends on what you consider culture . 
  geographically , you 're as balkan as can be . 
  some of the rest might argue that they 're central or eastern - the north/west/east borders of balkan are n't 100 % clearly defined . 
  but you 're on the very southern tip of the peninsula , it does n't get clearer than that . 
  and yes , you are different , ancient greece is older than these divisions . 
  enough of that ancient culture was preserved , alright . 
  after ancient greece , there was the byzantine empire - does that count as your heritage as well ? 
  i thought it does . 
  so , this empire and rome divided the rest of the balkans in their spheres of influence , military/economy/religion / culture . 
  some of us leaned towards rome , others towards constantinople . 
  then , you all had the misfortune of being occupied by ottomans ( unlike some of the rest ) for a long time , that left a mark . 
  so saying that you ca n't be culturally grouped with central and eastern balkan which modeled so much of itself * on your example * , or shared so much of the circumstances with you , is weird at best . 
  it 'd be like italy claiming it has nothing to do with our dalmatian coast , or that it has more in common with portugal than dalmatia , despite the fact that you can * see italy * in our coastal towns . 
  or , italy claiming that the dalmatian coast has more in common with bulgaria and serbia than with italy . 
  `` because balkan , ewww '' . 
  it 's nonsense . 
  geographically ? 
  russia is too big , the geographic center of europe - and there are several , disputed ones - is much more east than what people think . 
  when you ask `` where 's the dividing line ? 
  '' , people will say germany or maybe czechia , but that 's geographically very incorrect . 
  historically or culturally ? 
  we had about equally little to do with both uk/france and russia . 
  most of `` central '' europe had more to do with germany/austria , who are called western , and yet if you called slovakia/croatia/etc western , people would stare at you . 
  sooo , where do you put us ? 
  slavs are east ? 
  but geographically , czech are almost equally west as austria , same for slovenia , and what do you make of the non-slavs on the other side of the iron curtain ? 
  latin/cyrillic alphabet ? 
  [ does n't work . 
  ] ( http://www.eurfedling.org/maps/alphabets_europe.jpg ) religion ? 
  [ does n't work . 
  ] ( https://churchpop.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/traditional-religions.png ) basically , the term central europe is very nebulous , but it seems necessary if we 'll define europe according to east/west/north / south . 
  i hear you . 
  and it goes beyond the wars for us . 
  yugoslavia was a good idea on paper at the time , and well at least it kept us safe from our `` loving '' neighbors , we industrialized ( though that would have happened anyways ) . 
  aside from that , given its many and varied failures , to be honest - to hell with any idiot who thinks it 's a good idea to `` get strong ties with the region '' . 
  from my point of view , that 's as stupid as , well - ex-ussr deciding that their progress lies in russia instead of the eu . 
  experiment 's over , we 're back to our old political alignment . 
  one side-note/partial correction ~ austro-hungary did n't stop at czech republic and slovenia . 
  slovakia and croatia were a part of that too . 
  in our case , we spent 800 years with first hungary and then the combination , which is imo more relevant than the 71 years of the failed yugo experiment . 
  and if you 'll consider religion as part of culture , which is the correct thing to do because in the past religion was much more tied with politics and culture , and then draw the line rome/constantinople or catholic/orthodox , we 're on the western side again . 
  aside from that , good comment . 
  ehh , calling slovenia balkan appears to be a more effective trigger than calling them alpine croats , so i rather doubt they like being called eastern as well . 
  `` we 're central '' , they say to everyone and their grandmother . 
  heh :d good map , anyways . 
  and for what it 's worth , over here baltics are baltics . 
  people do n't mention you in terms of east/west/north , but just baltics ... probably because you 3 stick with each other , and you 're odd ducks in general , not slav , not `` viking '' , not xyz . 
  tbh you 're kinda lucky in that , `` baltics '' does n't have negative connotations . 
  on the other end of the continent , we get to be eastern or balkan or occasionally southern ( of the recent pay denbts !, 
  infamy ) , * joy * . 
  / u/h2ppyme , were you making a lighthearted joke , pointing out unfortunate ignorance through sarcasm , or ... ? 
  bah , i just used your comment to get the point across . 
  `` hurr durr you should n't be ok getting grouped with nigel farage '' . 
  people go like `` well why do you lot get triggered by being called eastern '' , easy to say when you 're in the west and people go to the effort of distinguishing your country from other western countries . 
  and `` west '' does n't mean a crapton of negative stereotypes which are n't even true half of the time . 
  and that they have no clue , i know that . 
  we 're irrelevant to them . 
  but most of the west is equally irrelevant to us , and yet i do n't see the same amount of gross generalizations . 
  bloody hell south america could n't matter less to me , and yet i can point to at least some of the differences among them . 
  given the long history italy had on the other side of the adriatic , which only really ended after wwii , you 'd think at least you lot would know a thing or two ; - ;, 
  your flair points to a place in italy , unless i googled the name incorrectly . 
  and in op 's map with which he 's making a point , italy is part of western europe . 
  so , you say `` you 're ok with this '' , being part of western europe i assume . 
  and * my point * , and op 's point , is how unfair it is that countries that rarely have much to do with each other are grouped together so often . 
  i see that every other day , generalizations like `` eastern eu/europe does [ insert negative thing ] '' . 
  and when i ask around , it usually turns out that * some specific country * from the east is doing that negative thing . 
  so , why does n't it go `` specific country x '' , instead of `` eastern europe '' ? 
  i listed out some negative events or stereotypes that come from western countries . 
  and to draw an equivalent , i grouped the west together , instead of saying `` uk messed up here , france there , etc etc '' . 
  because that 's what happens with us . 
  saying `` east is n't cooperating on migrant quotas '' is just as dishonest as saying `` west is threatening to break the eu '' ( farage , wilders , le pen ) . 
  well , shame on you then !, 
  why is your western euro country constantly striking against something ? 
  and threatening to break the eu every other tuesday ?
