  and pretending you do n't understand english ? 
  and you anschluss the beaches in early mornings !, 
  the tax-haven bullshit is also not very nice , so much about `` our common interests '' . 
  and you messed up the migrant flood !, 
  and that nigel farage , how can you not be embarrassed by him !, 
  & nbsp ; you get my drift ? 
  news : `` eastern eu making trouble again ! '', 
  facts : it 's v4 . 
  or not even v4 , but hungary and poland alone . 
  so , to make it fair , should n't you , an italian , * do something * about uk 's strange life choices ? 
  + laziness , you toss the colors in mapchart or wherever , though even that sometimes takes time , because countries often do n't care about putting themselves in neat boxes + too many small states - between poland and greece , also benelux , gets hard to write out the numbers sometimes, 
  i figure italy would get salty about istria again , so maybe better not :3, 
  [ so it is :3 ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6k1bkd/monument_to_potato_in_me%c4%91imurje_county_croatia/ ), 
  [ tell me about that purity , will you ~ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/gll0m9y.png ), 
  because croatia is considered eastern when it comes to simple east/west divisions ( you * might * argue that we 're central or southern , but nobody will ever say we 're western ) , and you lot are more to the east than we are . 
  the problem starts with russia being so huge . 
  if you divided europe in even boxes , the center of europe would end up being in poland . 
  or even belarus . 
  and nobody thinks that some parts of poland or belarus are `` actually western '' . 
  but if italy and ottomans and napoleon do n't count , how does serbia count then ? 
  wait , what are you even counting for serbia ? 
  90 's annexation of bits ? 
  ( that 's the same as venice and ottomans . ), 
  sfry should n't count at all . 
  or are you talking about yugoslavia1 , when king established his dictatorship , dismissed the parliament ? 
  wait , but yugoslavia1 ceased to exist , is there anyone who even `` inherited '' it ? 
  i think the problem is something similar to the dialect continuum when it comes to language . 
  ( as in , slovenians will mostly understand the kajkavian speakers , similar goes for the south/east parts of serbia and macedonians ( i think ? 
  ) , while slovenians and macedonians do n't understand each other . ), 
  just on our example , coast is closest to italy , north-west to slovenia/austria , slavonia to hungary but also vojvodina , but then the other parts of serbia ... not so much . 
  bosnia is its own story , split on 3 or more lines . 
  then going with the continuum , i seriously doubt that slovenia is somehow closer to/more influenced by macedonia or even serbia than it is by austria . 
  macedonia is closer to bulgaria ( and pretend-greece ) than the rest of us . 
  we have the food we `` borrowed '' from turkey . 
  and ex-yu rock , i guess . 
  and endless arguments . 
  except even those do n't work for everyone , montenegro seems to get along with all . 
  other similarities , like the difficult transition to capitalism , i listen to the rest of ex-commies and it 's the same thing repeating almost everywhere . 
  besides . 
  the biggest `` cultural influence '' all of us share is n't each other , but usa . 
  sigh . 
  it 's just frustrating . 
  balkan as a geographical term is just that , only geography ( though vaguely defined ) . 
  problem is the very negative stereotype , which no-one sane wants for their country and people . 
  yes , i did hear stuff about the criminals from multiple western countries , but the thing is - they were n't * ours * ... 
  i do n't even hear anything about our gastarbajter , unless it 's `` there are a lot of them '' and `` they receive less social welfare than even the native germans '' ( i do n't have anything for netherlands ) . 
  and i 'm about as responsible for these criminals as you are for the french striking and pretending not to understand english . 
  or brits brexiting . 
  you get my drift ? 
  you would n't want to be lumped in with someone else 's shit either . 
  especially if you 're a small country where reputation matters a lot . 
  our politicians choosing who will rule , first with hungarians and then with habsburgs ? 
  varying degrees of autonomy , dependent on circumstances ? 
  [ tesla 's passport ? 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/putovnica_nikola_tesla_01082.jpg ) well , that works for croatia , i 'm not * that * informed on slovenia . 
  i assumed you concluded it was n't that bad in retrospect , because of the - let 's say , favorable - opinions on austria that today 's slovenians display . 
  ( favorable is putting it lightly . ), 
  my bad . 
  we did n't do nuffin russia told us red-white-blue are a totally legit slav thing now that 's my story and i 'm sticking to it, 
  i have my opinions on that bit of whining . 
  yes , we have it too , narrative about `` hurr durr 1000 years ' dream of independence '' . 
  that narrative was established mostly in the 19th century , during the nation-building that happened everywhere - go figure . 
  i hold that you * do n't * stay in a union with someone for 800 years ( !, 
  ) , with hardly a rebellion to speak of , if it 's `` help help i 'm being oppressed ! '', 
  and i have something to compare a-h with , venice and ottomans annexing our bits . 
  there were rebellions and wars concerning those `` every other tuesday '' . 
  came here to be criminal ? 
  seriously ? 
  keep dividing every year ? 
  again , which ones ? 
  yeah , i know many of us speak the same language so it gets harder to tell the difference , but that 's no excuse . 
  irish and brits speak the same language , but try to tell them they 're the same or put them in the same box , see how well that goes . 
  and that 's our problem with these `` balkan '' generalizations . 
  everything you said for greece is true for most of croatia . 
  if we can go to the effort of not lumping * belgium * with netherlands or france , then really ... 
  ah , i hear you , but i still think a lot of these divisions are arbitrary cold war - that is , commie and not-commie ones . 
  slovenia and croatia spent 800 years in some version of union with hungary/austria ( and bits were occupied by venice/italy at times ) , and were catholic which meant they were culturally turned towards rome . 
  while the rest were turned towards constantinople , and spent time under ottomans . 
  you can see * that * border on croatia 's modern borders . 
  and yet , we 're grouped with balkan and ex-yugos because of only 73 years of yugoslavia . 
  which was n't even in any block during cold war ... it 's just because of the commie-thing . 
  people jak about `` culture '' , and yet zagreb looks more like vienna than skopje . 
  greece is as geographically balkan as it gets , if there 's any country that ca n't escape from balkan , then it 's greece . 
  yet they 're not called balkan . 
   my point - to reiterate - was that it matters what politicians do , as you can clearly destroy progress in war or through disastrous economical policies . 
  happy ending is not guaranteed . 
  oh , sure . 
  to expand a bit ... 
  i do n't know if bulgaria has anything like that , over here we have these `` yugonostalgics '' . 
  people who argue that the old system was n't that bad , or was actually better in some ways . 
  ( looking at how we lost worker 's rights after the fall of our communism , they do have a point . ), 
  and among the many arguments is `` well , look at all the industry/etc etc that was built '' . 
  and i think giving a lot of credit to tito for that is a fallacy , because industry was coming - would have come - anyways . 
  obviously , politicians do n't like to talk like that , you wo n't find them saying `` well , this recovery would have just happened '' , nooo they 'll take credit for everything that 's good . 
  and i feel like something similar might be happening in the west . 
  i also feel that if we 'll look for politics doing a lot for science , then we need to go way back , to the time where patents/copyrights for inventors were established . 
  that might be the more relevant turning point . 
  but back to your point about war ~ yes , obviously war destroys progress . 
  but i 'm not sure how having only one power , or having multiple powers affects that . 
  did we avoid wwiii because of politics , or because of * nukes * , which are again a technological invention ?
