  maybe the multiple-powers bit works as checks-and-balances ? 
  like , if there was only one power in the world , what would stop it from establishing a total dictatorship ? 
  no , but i read that initial comment as `` the world progressed in the last 20-30 years because the cold war ended '' . 
  and i 'm saying that 's not true , the world was progressing during the cold war as well . 
  and on both sides of the iron curtain . 
  now , obviously we can argue about the failings of communism/socialism , why those ca n't really function long-term . 
  i do tend to agree that they ca n't . 
  however , the same commies here built up industry , and universal free schooling and education , raised standards incomparably ... actually , the scale of the leap we had during communism is way , way larger than the last 25 + capitalist years . 
  and this standard-of-living is what the comment was addressing . 
  so , my argument is that politics do n't really have that much to do with progress . 
  i give credit for the vast , vast majority of humanity 's progress in the last 100-200 years to * nerds * , not politicians . 
  my opinion is that politicians need to only be as `` good '' as it is needed so that nerds can do their work in peace . 
  to be fair , was n't this  an amazing decrease in poverty , hunger , and disease , and a remarkable increase in wealth , education , and living standards . 
  ... a matter of technology progressing ? 
  as in , the world developing regardless of what politicians do ? 
  in regards to the east/west or usa/ussr or even commie/not-commies divisions , it 's not like the not-commies were the only ones to make great strides in the 2nd half of the 20th century . 
  or , it 's not china and eastern block and even yugoslavia waited for the west to build schools and hospitals and factories . 
  that 's fair , but . 
  most that i met did n't have much of a distinction between * i believe * and * i know * that `` there is no god '' . 
  add more than a few dashes of snobbery where `` those believers are stupid , ha , they believe in something they ca n't prove ! '', 
  the irony of fact that atheists ca n't prove their position either escapes them . 
  if you ask me , both of those are a * belief * , an opinion . 
  and all of us can explain our reasoning as to why we believe there is/isn ' t a god with more or less success , but since nobody has the answer , i do n't see much reason for all the butthurt . 
  + italy claims it because istria dalmatia rightful clay + hungary claims it because it was actually `` theirs '' through most of history , italians were illegal interlopers , they pull out the old agreements , claim that * we * obviously made the decision before we disappeared + bosnia claims it because `` look , bosnia and croatia actually were the same thing 600 years ago '' + serbia claims it because srbija do tokija + while they 're all arguing , austria and germany buy all the concessions :3, 
  [ balkan is always to the east/south of where the speaker happens to be standing ~ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge4sxlgiaga ), 
  as a person from an ex-commie country , you should know very well that being non-religious does n't necessarily make people any better . 
  in an amazing plot twist , haters gon na hate , and idiots gon na idiot , regardless of which ideology - or presumed `` lack of ideology '' - they excuse that with . 
  and yes , i do consider irrational people irrational . 
  i 've met far , far too many militant atheists who were equally * willfully deaf * to counter-arguments in discussion to consider them rational . 
  some were n't even willfully deaf , but just stupid . 
  that happens as well . 
  to be fair , we got something like 15 million tourists last year ... our native population is 4 million . 
  so you need to add those that ca n't afford or do n't vacation for whatever reason to the fact that we 're a foreign colony during the tourist season . 
  ohhh thank you . 
  i almost thought it 's rare to conclude that a bunch of atheists are just as irrational about the issue as the religious are . 
  to expand : i met a number of rational believers and non-believers , smart people who could explain themselves well . 
  and then , of course , i met plenty from both sides who were equally unreasonable about it , only religious rant about hell , while atheists come up with bullshit like `` religion is the biggest cancer of the world '' . 
  as weird as this sounds , it 's like - `` atheism became their new * belief * , the religious became their new devil '' . 
  look , i 'm not a fan of merkel 's reaction , and i 'm even less of a fan of the general eu response to this ( `` no no no not my problem , not my problem !, 
  '' ) , but afaik merkel opened the doors * after * italy , greece and hungary were about to implode anyways . 
  italy and greece have been sending warnings about the problem for * years * before it hit us all in 2015 , but obviously everyone else liked to be useless or worse ( like stopping italy from ferrying them back , iirc , because `` human rights '' ) . 
  in some ideal world ~ you 'd finish a non-useless college by 23-24 , get a job immediately , have the first kid by , let 's say - 28 , 29 . 
  the second by 33 maybe . 
  of course , the occasional couple would have 3 , simply to make up for those that have one or none , so these years need to be moved around a bit . 
  but that 's the ideal world in which you may get to party in early 20 's , travel the world a bit , get a decent job by 26 . 
  so ... yeah , no , not happening . 
  would it be more or less insulting if usa 's flag was used instead of australian ? 
  oh , i said that it was the best chance of getting fixed , not that i 'm sure it 'd have worked . 
  in regards to serbia , i 've long since concluded that slobo did n't give 3 shits about the krajina serbs ( and serbs in general , for that matter ) , he only cared for money and power . 
  but the question is , would the destruction of rs mean that to keep power , slobo needs to keep warring ? 
  as in , the mood - elections - in serbia dictate that . 
  on one hand , everybody and their grandmother told * us * that sao krajina is here to stay because bla bla bla , insert threats , insert dire predictions , 4 days later they said `` but but our experts said otherwise '' . 
  on the other hand , sao alone is n't the same as sao + rs , that 's like +1 vs +3 difficulty . 
   i agree , i do n't like the guy , and i do n't like particularly any politician in bosnia , but that aside , is n't he just like every other politician from the balkans ? 
  no , i meant ... ok . 
  if the best odds of economic recovery were resting on the shoulders of a croat/bosniak , would you vote for him ? 
  and the other way around , would the other two peoples vote for someone who is n't them ? 
  and , let 's assume that you 're an enlightened fellow who sees that ethnic divisions are n't getting you anywhere , all of you are drowning in shit . 
  would enough people , across all of bosnia , be equally enlightened ? 
  or would they keep voting for shitheads 1/2/3 * just because * they 're `` theirs '' ? 
  a number of people will always vote for stupid ideology instead of real concerns like * taxes and jobs * . 
  the goal is to have the smarter folks outvote the idiots who are mentally still in the 90 's or wwii or whichever * past , finished time * . 
  honest but brutal opinion incoming ~ bosnia 's best odds for getting `` fixed '' were in summer ' 95 , when arbih , hvo and hv were a stone-throw away from banja luka . 
  but usa said `` no no , you ca n't do that , i 'll kick you if you do that '' , and so we did n't . 
  and putting moral issues aside , to this day i ca n't tell whether it would have worked to rid bosnia from rs , and even if * that * happened , what would have become of serbia ( and montenegro ) . 
  the logic went like `` dude , serbia already took in a massive wave of refugees in a matter of days , if it took an even bigger one months later , it 'd fly to pieces/get a civil war/have no choice but to continue warring/you 'd have a total basket case as a neighbor/etc etc '' . 
  so , that did n't happen , and bosnia kept on crawling like a mini-yugoslavia kept together by external force and/or the lack of ability to keep warring . 
  all the arguments for why it 's in the end good that juga fell apart work for bosnia too , only bosnia ca n't do that thing where the kids get into a fight and the teacher sends them to their own corners of the classroom . 
  as for `` well , what do ?? '', 
  today ... 
  i do n't really know . 
  but i feel that its starts with  the whole point of declaring rs independent in 1991 was to avoid bosniak rule over serbs , that kinda goes to hell if rs loses it 's autonomy/entity status . 
  i do n't think dodik is your friend . 
  i think he 's a thief that 's keeping you miserable by playing on your emotions . 
  he 's blaming others for all your problems . 
  and then there 's the mentality of `` tito stole but tito also gave '' which we all inherited , along with `` ehhh , better if i 'm robbed by * my own people * '' . 
  no , it 's not better that you , takamorisaigo , are robbed by a serb instead of a croat or a bosniak or whomever , because you 're robbed all the same . 
  and you 'll keep on being robbed while you vote for ethnicity first , instead of `` economic program '' . 
  we have something similar with hdz/sdp or right/left divisions . 
  `` why are you voting for/against hdz ? '', 
  `` well , beacuse it 's hdz ! '', 
  only ours is n't as harmful as yours ... which is bad . 
  being better than our lot is nothing to boast about . 
  i think the poor economy is a chicken-or-egg scenario . 
  that is , first issues are : bosnia being rather underdeveloped even before the war ( `` thanks for building no motorways , tito '' ) , then the war hit them so much worse than it did croatia and serbia . 
  so the starting position was already lamer . 
  but , if you were a foreign investor , would you invest in bosnia , with its byzantine politics and regulations ? 
  add the preposterous triple-government system , it 's hard enough to keep one government from screwing everything over ( i 'd know ) , 3 of them ? 
  just the public sector is way , waaaaay too large . 
  and given that the 3 sabotage each other - and the whole country , including * their * people - out of spite , distrust and whatever else , well how can the economy get better ? 
  ( i know that blaming the war-damage does n't work even for bosnia in 2017 , because i can look at how much work was done to actually fix it - proportionally , in comparison to croatia and serbia . ), 
  oh , it is . 
  but i do n't think it was supposed to be this way , in year 2017 . 
  dayton was the best that could be done in 1995 , without further bloodshed . 
  but it did n't really make anyone happy , rs serbs did n't get to annex themselves to serbia , bosniaks saw rs getting around 50 % of the country as `` rewarding the aggressor '' , croats did n't even get their own entity ( and also did n't get to annex themselves to croatia , which was the goal at mid-point of the war ) . 
  and the normal people who do n't care about all that ? 
  well , they constantly get `` rewarded '' by a disfunctional state . 
  it 's like belgium , but poor , and the entities hate each other 's guts half of the time . 
  in more normal states , the leading politicians blame the opposition and the other way around whenever something does n't work , but in bosnia , add these literal divisions ... like , imagine if the russians in estonia got autonomy , what are the odds that either of these two entities could ever get anywhere when for every bit of incompetence/corruption these estonian politicians do , they can blame the russians ( and the other way around ) ? 
  anyways , i * think * that the plan/hope was that the 3 people 's in bosnia will ... settle down with time , so then the state could move towards abolishing these divisions .
