  what a shock , is n't it ? 
  eastern euros must all think the same , do n't they ? 
  which is the exact same bigotry you presumably fight against . 
  your view is that `` people x discriminate against people y. '', 
  but , what you just did is discriminate against people x , throw them all in the same box based on negative examples . 
  if i did the same , i 'd conclude that `` all you western euros are like the uk '' . 
  i assume that you would n't like * that * . 
  you think vladimir putin and donald trump are the leaders of eastern europe ? 
  do you even know the basic geography ? 
  uh , which bit ? 
  bigotry in general ? 
  or the relation of serbia with t_d and alt-right ? 
  this bigot ( on the opposite side of the spectrum ) assuming that serb = t_d , which is the exact same type of narrow-minded judgement they proclaim to fight ? 
  ^ perfect example of all-encompassing bigotry i mentioned , / u/porodicnostablo . 
  this fine fellow either lack reading comprehension , or s/he never bothered to actually read your submission . 
  so , they assumed that since you 're a serb , you must have said something t_d-like , instead of the other way around . 
  how excellent , this one caught both usa and eastern europe at the same time . 
  such enlightenment !, 
  it 's meta , i think . 
  meta 's are supposed to go to / r/europemeta ... dead sub , unfortunately . 
  anyways , they 'll tell that `` it 's not racism '' because religion is n't race . 
  my view is that many of the eastern euros never cared to adopt the `` do n't judge a box by one of its many contents '' policy , while western euros adopting is was paper-thin . 
  take the roma example . 
  afaik some `` verily progressive '' west/north euros used to sharply criticize `` those unenlightened easterners '' about the treatment and/or the lack of integration of the roma people . 
  * then * , those same snobby euros got their own roma neighbors . 
  that made them rather quiet , fast ... so much about high ideals . 
  ( it reminds me of people saving poor african children with * internet petitions * , feeling very good about those `` enlightened '' efforts . ), 
  the tone people here use against islam , they use the same tone against russia , africa , china , usa , etc etc. 
  in short , people are bigots and like to pat themselves on the back about how non-bigot they are at the same time . 
  i have so many what-if questions , and so many questions in general ~ i do n't know how familiar you are with our history , as well as its retroactive narratives . 
  there 's that `` 1000 year dream of independence , hurr durr '' . 
  and i scoff at that , we may * talk * about muh sovereignty , but we are n't completely * stupid * - we know that we are small and politics is less cooperation and nice ideals , more greed and violence . 
  small fish like us need unions to survive and do well , simply because various neighbors ( like italy/venice , cough ) will annex whatever they can . 
  so as a whole , the logical conclusion i arrive to when i look at 800 ( ! ), 
  years of our union with hungary and then a-h is that obviously it was good for us . 
  ( there 'd be more rebellions , for a start , if it was bad enough . ), 
  or less bad than the alternatives , like falling to ottomans or whomever . 
  and for what it 's worth , a-h really did invest in our infrastructure , education and so on . 
  so - why all these problems in the 19th century ? 
  did * we * grow more nationalistic and greedy ? 
  did austria ? 
  or both ? 
  19th century was a time of nation-building pretty much everywhere , when suddenly it mattered which language your emperor speaks , like it did n't before . 
  so i wonder whether a-h could have withstood the pressure of being so very multi-ethnic , where common people do n't even understand each other , much less have the same interests . 
  to me that empire looks like a mini-eu ... only , way too soon . 
  way before its time , where we not only lacked the harsh lessons of the world wars , but also lacked the basic logistics like a modern citizen 's society with its separation of powers . 
  i mean , just look at the enormous efforts needed to keep even the modern eu together and functional enough ... as for yugoslavia , oh . 
  good idea in theory . 
  shoddy implementation . 
  radi\u0107 went on about `` ne srljajte kao guske u maglu '' , and we totally ignored him . 
  only , i do n't know if any of us had the proper time needed to set better foundations for that country - bigger fish on the borders looked quite hungry . 
  for what it 's worth , at least it kept us safe enough from said bigger fish . 
  heheh , enjoy :d and if you have any touristic questions , we have a tourist megathread stickied on r/croatia , 
  i ca n't speak for bosnia with the same confidence , but ~ as always , we had rather split in opinions here . 
  sure , a-h both lost the plot and was n't very good for us by the end , the last 100 years maybe . 
  ( but i 'm not buying the `` oppression '' narrative before that , we willingly joined both hungary and habsburgs later , and all that whining reminds me of how various countries today whine against the eu ... that is , if whining was even widespread at the time , instead of * retroactively added by later historians and intellectuals . 
  * ) so , quite a few of our people were active in the pan-yugoslav ideas in the later half of the 19th century , and once the whole empire fell apart after wwi , well - `` we may as well '' . 
  but , there were also people who genuinely wanted to stay in a-h , saw ferdinand as a legit hope and so on . 
  so that assassination was a kick in the teeth for them . 
  though as i said , his death was the first nail in the coffin , the empire going bust after wwi was the end of it . 
  everyone was out of options , so ... \\* shrug * now , whether a-h would have improved if it won the war or ferdinand survived is a matter of debate . 
  ( i 'm leaning towards - yes , it probably would have - because we were n't the only slavs pushing for even more autonomy . ), 
  and of course , gavrilo 's action also got retroactively darkened by the many and varied failures of yugoslavia . 
  but yugoslavia being judged as equally bad or even worse than a-h is a story for another time , and i doubt gavrilo could see into the future . 
  well , ours has clear reasons . 
  perfect snapshot of our ruling politicians , what i think he may have been thinking : [ ... maybe i should n't have said that the recent massive fires where football fans were more useful than the government are just excessively `` media attractive '' ? 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/0hlk2d8dabcz.jpg ), 
  and the strangest thing is ~ so i totally do n't know the history , but ukrainians tend to claim that the whole rus thing is actually ukrainian because it started in kiev etc etc. 
  or something like that . 
  and it may be that slavs as a whole migrated from somewhere around the black sea , some went north , some west , some south . 
  so it stands to reason that the folks around kiev are the `` oldest '' . 
  so ... does that mean that i 'm actually ukrainian on this blessed day ? 
  but being born in europe or having european background means ... what ? 
  speaking an indo-european language or having institutions that were built in europe ? 
  being white ? 
  yeah , that 's not limited to europe , colonial powers exported a lot of things . 
  and same culture was also influenced by mena . 
  i mean , me saying that i 'm european has all the significance of me saying that i 'm slav , or that i eat more wheat than rice , or whatever . 
  it 's a `` and , so ... ? '', 
  statement , i do n't think i 'd feel my `` europeaness '' as something relevant , unless i visited sub-saharan africa or china or whatever . 
  eu at least , that 's a political union with goals , and i voted yes to join it . 
  that 's more significant to me than an accident of birth . 
  you are aware that the uk is an island with at least somewhat significant cultural and political ties around the world ? 
  and oh , look , i have another difference .

  but what would it even mean , considering yourself `` european '' ? 
  europe is just a continent , it does n't have much meaning on its own . 
  would n't identity go more like ... 1 . 
  i 'm country/ethnicity x ( those two are different sometimes , and may make up another number on this list )   2 . 
  i 'm from city/region y    3 . 
  i 'm from eu       4 . 
  i 'm from europe ? 
  different parts of europe , usually on opposite geographical ends , did n't have much historical reason to even think of each other , and similar would go today . 
  today , many of us have more reason to consider china , usa , japan and so on , than we do each other . 
  eu is the thing that changes the situation . 
  and the funniest thing , this article has links for all the countries , questions , everything . 
  it 's under `` standard eurobarometer 87 '' , then you have the factsheets for everyone . 
  to the surprise of no one in croatia , croats are apparently mildly trusting and optimistic of the eu , while the national government and internal issues are `` all doom and gloom '' .
