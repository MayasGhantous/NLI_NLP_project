  it 's not just putin himself that 's the problem , but the structures that let putin rule - from people 's opinions , to how the society is run in general . 
  so , that 'd take a while , you do n't go from dictatorship/oligarchy to a society ordered in the western way overnight ... we 're talking two decades , at least . 
  then , they 'd need to do a lot of work to charm/reassure their neighbors who get triggered the moment you say `` russia '' . 
  on top of that , i 'm not sure that the more populous eu countries would like to lose their numerical ( and economic ) superiority in the union . 
  and finally ... 
  i 'm not sure whether it 'd be a good idea even from an economic perspective . 
  russia is bigger than all of europe combined . 
  it literally borders the pacific ocean . 
  that - and its complicated internal structures that keep all that big geography and population together - means that russia will have different priorities . 
  take just the simplest questions like `` trading with china '' , we 'll have different answers for that . 
  maybe it 'd make more sense - from both points of view - to give this hypothetical more-friendly and orderly russia a looser economic agreement . 
  i think that the same will happen with turkey if or when they reform as well . 
   says the person who arrogantly made a wrong assumption about greece in the very same thread . 
  who are you even talking to ? 
  hm , well so many of them have english/foreign equivalents . 
  but anyways , here 's some + kud svi turci , tud i mali mujo . 
  `` where all the turks ( go ) , little mujo ( follows ) . '', 
  mujo is the stereotypical bosnian name/joke character , the equivalent might be `` when in rome , do as romans do . '', 
  `` better ( to have ) a sparrow in the hand then a pigeon on the branch . 
  '' , it 's the equivalent of `` a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush . '', 
  = `` as indebted as greece '' . 
  yes , it is way older than the most recent pay denbts crisis . 
  sorry greece !, 
  = `` where there is smoke , there is a fire , too . '', 
  we use that one when you get all sorts of accusations flying around , basically it means `` well there must be at least * something * nefarious in all this '' . 
  = `` the apple does n't fall far from the tree . '', 
  = `` when a willow bears grapes . '', 
  basically , that ai n't happening . 
  = `` have both the sheep and the money . '', 
  it 's having your cake and eating it too . 
  = `` first sweep the ground in front of your own door . '', 
  it 's a version of `` he who is without faults , cast the first stone '' . 
  = `` one hundred midwives , sluggish baby . '', 
  something like the eu ( dys ) function today xd + `` svakog gosta tri dana dosta . '', 
  = `` three days of every guest is enough . '', 
  = `` quiet water wears down mountains . '', 
  still waters run deep . 
  = `` the one who wakes up early , catches two fortunes . '', 
  the early bird catches the worm . 
  = `` the one who wakes up early , spends the whole day sleepy . '', 
  no , you 're only showing a typical outsider 's ignorance with your comment . 
  serbia and croatia quite literally had more than 1300 years of separate history and politics . 
  we did n't even come to the balkans together . 
  they turned towards constantinople , we turned towards rome . 
  we were with versions of austro-hungary for 800 years ( !, 
  ) , they were either independent or conquered by ottomans . 
  by your logic , literally none of your former colonies are countries or people groups , * ignorant brit * , they 're all just `` brits in denial '' . 
  except you have better cause for calling usa `` big england '' , because usa has been conquered by you , is a land of immigrants which started with your people , and has left you * only * 250 years ago . 
  ignorance is not a sin , you do n't give 3 shits about us so you do n't have reason to inform yourself . 
  but acting like * you * know my country and my history better than i do is something else entirely . 
  they all look the same to me !, 
  and when does `` love '' genuinely play a role in international politics ? 
  assuming that propaganda about `` yes , yes , we really love each other '' may not apply . 
  1300 + years of separate history and politics rings any bells for two of them ? 
  yes , yes , they 're dialects , which through political decisions have been proclaimed as separate languages . 
  and the same worked in reverse , they used to be further apart but through pan-slavic and later organized yugoslav political efforts were brought closer together . 
  ( there 's a reason the \u0161tokavski dialect was chosen for `` standard croatian '' , and it 's not it being somehow more pure or anything , but simply being spoken more widely in the rest of ex-yu . ), 
  given the lack of political effort to keep the whole thing together nowadays - it 's actually the opposite , linguists working extra hard to undo the standardization - i expect that said dialects will drift apart again . 
  ottoman invasion worst century of my life gib back rightful clay ~, 
  i expect that most of ours would be shilling for the croatian department of tourism . 
  except they 're not paying us ; - ;, 
  but even if the ottoman empire `` lives according to them '' , do n't they know how far said ottomans managed to get into europe ? 
  i mean ... we can argue about ottomans for all sorts of reasons , but i think we can all agree that they were relentless . 
  and it still took them centuries to take only the balkans , where they were permanently stopped anyways . 
  is n't it - all of them ? 
  ( seriously , that got old ages ago . ), 
  uhh , map is wrong for us . 
  as can be seen from the legend . 
  well if the rest is anything like we are , there may be something in what you said , just without the / s. 
  we 're split into two rough groups : tourists , and vacationers . 
  `` vacationers '' go to our coast ( vast majority of them anyways , i mean `` sea is sea '' ) , or whatever body of water - like lakes - they can find to get a tan . 
  so the people who live on/near the coast in the first place do n't have that as a reason to travel . 
  `` tourists '' on the other hand , are those who travel for the sake of sightseeing & etc. 
  i guess that you poor warm-sea-deficient euros do n't have that distinction . 
  i think relatives may not count ? 
  or the questionnaire may be [ a bit different from our dsz . 
  anyways , according to them , we should be around 56 % not taking any trips . 
  yes and no . 
  not even the geographers can agree on what is and is n't west/east . 
  or where the dividing line between those two would be ... the first problem is russia being so yuge . 
  iirc some geographers put the center of europe in poland , some even in * belarus * , and people go all `` lol wut ?? '', 
  if you tell them that some parts of belarus or even poland are supposed to be * western europe * . 
  then add all the culture and politics and history on top of that , not just the iron curtain not making geographical sense , but also issues such as prussia , austro-hungary , polish-lithuanian commonwealth and so on ... and basically , people came up with `` central europe '' to cut the arguments short . 
  but , we ca n't quite agree on what central europe is supposed to be either . 
  picking a fight with janezi is like ... like a slapfight with some bespectacled nerd . 
  as a side-note , whomever came up with using the word `` slammed '' as part of political reporting should take a public walk of shame , cersei-style  . <, 
  we beat hungary to become world champions in waterpolo . 
  [ suddenly , i care about waterpolo !, 
  yes , but - the parties !, 
  i 've been to a wedding that just happened in the office , not the church . 
  it was pretty lame as far as weddings go  . < that sterile , music-less office is light years away from a wedding inside a pretty cathedral . 
  and it 's like that for many other sacraments that we take `` very seriously indeed '' . 
  baptism , eucharist , confirmation , marriage , bloody hell even the funeral . 
  they 're all rites of passage in a way . 
  and you gather the family and friends for them , make a big feast out of it . 
  i mean , i 'm agnostic leaning towards atheist and i want to do all that stuff in the church , same as i want to go to mass for christmas and easter . 
  not because i identify with some `` god '' much , but it 's just ... it 's just what we do , as a tradition . 
  ( i mean , what 's next ? 
  a wedding without accordion ?? ), 
   safety situation ** overall **,
