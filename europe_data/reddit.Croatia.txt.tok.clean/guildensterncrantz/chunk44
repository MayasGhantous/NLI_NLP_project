  as a side-note , for us it 's `` slovenski '' & `` slova\u010dki '' . 
  also slovenija & slova\u010dka . 
  so , they 're easy to tell apart , one has \u010d and the other does n't . 
  ( then , we have a region called slavonija/slavonia , but fortunately it 's not on the coast so the tourists do n't get confused . ), 
  well they do occasionally mutter `` gib back coast , istria rightful clay '' , so - * serves them right . 
  oh , i hope so . 
  sometimes it seems to me that if you keep quiet , as in - do n't initiate whatever and just go along , but also do n't make problems/demands - you just sort of go ignored . 
  and then you get lumped in with neighbors , because that 's what people do with less-known variables . 
  as can be observed with random statements that start with `` east eu does x '' . 
  romania and bulgaria are actually part of the reason for my doubts , look at their ascension to schengen . 
  they fulfill all the technical requirements afaik , even the fears over `` dey took our jobs ! '', 
  do n't work because that 's not what schengen does , but those two are still blocked by a few western countries ( iirc netherlands , germany and finland ) because ... 
  i do n't know . 
  plus , the earlier comment about `` well , east eu can do their own multi-speed unions of whatever '' seems odd , because that 's exactly what the three seas initiative is - better integration on this eastern periphery - and yet the same initiative is greeted with suspicion/hostility in the west . 
  we 'll see , i suppose . 
  except for football . 
  but since world cup ' 98 , we always seem to think that `` this will be the year we finally get to gold !! 1 ! '', 
  what if i told you that croatia is one of the few countries that 's eager to join the eurozone ? 
  much more eager than some countries that are traditionally seen as `` western '' . 
  and this is a perfect example of multi-speed eu where goodwill alone is n't enough . 
  we can want the euro all we like , we do n't fulfill some of the requirements needed for it . 
  ( like the share of debt-to-gdp not being above 60 % ... nevermind that half of the eurozone does n't respect that polite `` suggestion '' , which is n't a suggestion but a rule * for us * . ), 
  this ties with [ my general fears ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6qb5x2/macron_merkel_talk_european_hard_core_france_and/dkvzerq/ ) that the faster-speed eu wo n't be just a matter of being a yes-man , but a matter of wealth , institutions and so on . 
  just take the comment you just wrote . 
  you divided the eu into `` east and west '' . 
  where west is ... better ? 
  more agreeable ? 
  meanwhile , from my point of view , the west is so agreeable that the uk just rage-quit the eu . 
  and sweden and denmark do n't want the euro . 
  and countries like romania and croatia get lumped in with the v4 , while their policies are n't the v4 policies . 
  ( did you know we actually volunteered to increase our quota of immigrants ? ), 
  read the numbers again , will you ? 
  what if both sides are hypocrites that are to blame ? 
  the west with its `` holier than you '' attitude , thinking that eu is some sort of ridiculous charity organization , and the east with its `` omg merkelreich is coming for our freedom !! '', 
  my general impression , from seeing both sides rant whatever makes them feel better about themselves , is that we should all cut down on the bullshit for a while . 
  sort of , honestly look each other in the eye , admit that we 're all bastards looking out for our own profits , admit that eu * is * a good way to increase profits for all , and move from there ? 
  because this bullshit about `` dey took our jerbs '' and `` dey took muh sovereignty '' is : 1 . transparent ; b ) annoying ; and c ) getting us nowhere . 
  * as a side-note , looking at the west/east or rich/poor rants , folks : this eerily reminds me of the root cause of yugoslavia flying to pieces . 
  so , do not take for granted what we all have here . 
  oh , i think we can all agree that those two are bad . 
  and at disastrous levels in most of eastern eu . 
  however , putting up borders would be fighting the symptom instead of the cause . 
  those brains we 're losing ? 
  well , we were n't putting them to work anyways , that 's the reason they 're leaving . 
  even with the unemployed being probably our greatest export , we 're still above 10 % , among the worst in eu . 
  and not letting them leave just gives you ... what ? 
  people who burden their families and the social welfare even more . 
  we need more jobs and better wages , not borders . 
  are you talking about one of the 4 freedoms , or the refugee/immigration relocation scheme ? 
  those are quite literally not the same thing . 
  inter-eu migration of eu citizens means that you , a croat , can move to germany to work . 
  if that did n't exist , we 'd be even worse off than we 're now - so many of our companies owned by foreigners , with profits being siphoned off elsewhere , so many of our local companies being unable to handle the competition in the increasingly global market . 
  to put it in simpler words , fi\u0107o and stojadin were shit cars that sold within yugoslavia because yuga was rather poor , and somewhat protected from better cars - insert germany , japan etc. 
  that ( crappy ) system went the way of the dodo way before we joined the eu . 
  but even if it somehow survived until 2013 , it 'd die then , with the more-open borders of eu . 
  so , free movement of people is here as a pressure release valve . 
  the migrant allocation scheme is something else entirely . 
  it started with greece being about to implode under pressure ... and nobody can let greece implode . 
  they have to `` pay denbts '' first , remember ? 
  ( western eu may * talk * a lot about the benefits of multi-kulti and `` being humanitarian and nice '' , * as if they were born yesterday * , but the motivation is something else entirely , i think . ), 
  my point is that you should first disagree with the uncontrolled movement of * owners * within the whole eu . 
  we 're slowly but surely becoming a glorified colony here . 
  remember the industry and jobs we used to have , but do n't anymore , because quite a lot of it was n't competitive in the globalized markets ? 
  do n't be silly . 
  people are leaving croatia , not entering it . 
  that was the joke , `` our locals join the migrant stream xd '' so , unless the eu means to introduce putting gps collars on them , or putting them into jail , or funding all the `` search and return '' missions , or raising a berlin wall at the border , most of those we get will leave croatia the next day . 
  * you 're safe from the nasty muslims , do n't worry < 3 *, 
  i do n't think it works that way . 
  i 'm no economist , so someone correct me if i 'm wrong ~ the reason you have free movement of goods/services/capital and people is that they * have to * go together . 
  if companies can move across borders easily , that will presumably mean people losing jobs in the old country , or even also people losing jobs in the new one , because the richer/bigger/more competitive companies - from the west , mostly - muscle out the local ( eastern ) ones . 
  so as to not have endless arguments about money going wherever , while people ca n't follow it , you basically make the issue a non-topic by allowing the migration of workers . 
  gdp per capita ? 
  look , i do n't * know * how exactly the two speed thing will function . 
  its architects seem to talk a lot along the lines of `` coalition of the willing '' . 
  which is neat and all , would solve the problem of `` how do we integrate when we have members dragging their feet '' , so you basically just integrate those that want it , end of story . 
  but . 
  let 's talk logistics for a moment ... let 's say ... `` in project x , every country is supposed to give an y amount of money , or a z percentage of gdp . '', 
  well , that works out better for those that can spare more money , does n't it ? 
  1 billion euros is n't the same thing for germany and croatia , same as 1-2 % of gdp - germany may be able to spare those small percentages , * we * do n't have any amount to spare because we 're only just making ends/deficit/debt / etc meet . 
  i do n't see how many ? 
  most ? 
  of whatever integration projects wo n't have such clauses , you either have to put an x amount of money on the table , or you need already-existing infrastructure/systems , be it in road quality or tax system or whatever . 
  so i 'm pessimistic about the already lower-speed eu being able to participate , regardless of them being willing or not . 
  the rich kids , probably . 
   croatia has an external border that it should protect too . 
  easier said than done . 
  so as i said yesterday in a different thread , greece was about to implode . 
  hungary was overrun as well . 
  and it all almost-functioned while the stream went north normally , not like any of them want to stay in greece/hungary/croatia . 
  then hungary put barbed wire everywhere , and they were stuck in serbia . 
  after that , serbia started bussing them to our border . 
  we got hundreds of thousands within days ... in a country of 4 million ( that 'd be like , idk , germany getting 1 million daily ) , but the problem was that slovenia and austria started blocking their borders too . 
  so , in lack of other options , we started pressing serbia to divert them elsewhere by closing the border to their cargo traffic , then citizens . 
  * we got immediate howling about that , had to drop that measure within a day or two . 
  * imagine what kind of howling we 'd get if we put our own barbed wire on borders ? 
  water canons , well i do n't even dare consider that option . 
  and anyways , i 'm told that serbia was * instructed * to keep the flow going anyways , not like they kept their borders opened just because . 
  as for our side , not that we feel like wasting money on barbed wire , when they do n't even want to stay here , we ca n't afford to keep half a million or more here , they refuse to even be fingerprinted , oh and remember how everyone `` condemned '' orban for his wire ? 
  that 's the thing with this stream . 
  border countries are somehow supposed to `` stop them '' .
