  because sadly wringing hands and saying `` what can i do '' is on the level of `` feed hungry african children with facebook likes '' . 
  do n't pull my leg with false moralizing , if spain has problems with austerity and corruption and neoliberal policies ( and ethnic cleansing in the future ) , it 's because the people of spain * let that happen * . 
  `` we '' outnumber `` them '' by hundreds of thousands , we * could * demand that things function better , but we ca n't be bothered to . 
  so we 're both shitposting on reddit about how we `` protest '' against the way things are . 
  i gave two examples of homogenization process : forceful assimilation and ethnic cleansing . 
  you said  and it will tend to homogenize by the same means . 
  so what , you 're telling me that forceful assimilation/ethnic cleansing will happen but you do n't support it , so what ? 
  you think such processes happen without the support of the citizens ? 
  and quite large support , both are inherently violent processes that need at least passivity from most people , if not action . 
  ( though quite a lot of action is needed as well . ), 
  it ca n't happen that the nation is split 50/50 and such events happen as an `` oops , who knew '' . 
  so are you telling me that you think it 'll happen in spain for example , but * you * will be one of the special decent snowflakes that 'll try to stop it ? 
  hey , if you 're all for ethnic cleansing , go vote for political parties that will do that . 
  regardless of laws , and how awful of an idea would it be to give politicians and soldiers the lawful power to cleanse people according to race/ethnicity . 
  ( beware , they could turn the same powers against you . ), 
  you 'll also have to find people who 'll * actually do it * , and who will take the fall for it in courts - do n't expect that those in power will be the fall guy who makes his hands dirty . 
  or , were you talking about forceful assimilation ? 
  how would that work ? 
  those with `` insufficient levels of patriotism '' are deported ? 
  ohh dear , what an excellent idea , that one would get * me * on the chopping block . 
  i thought all sorts of immigrants were invited into germany because germany had serious labor shortages ? 
  most of the world did n't get homogeneous naturally , that 's what 's wrong . 
  it was mostly either forceful assimilation , or in the last 100-200 years - ethnic cleansing . 
  they just used to call it `` population exchanges '' , as if that makes it better . 
  plus at least one old one that , based on my observations , only seems to appear in terrorism/immigrant threads . 
  which indicates at least a dullness of personality , i mean can you imagine only ever talking about a single thing ? 
  i get you . 
  my question at the end was more like ... `` what if country x is so much poorer in nominal gdp per capita that exporting my stuff to them is barely worth the cost of producing x , shipping x and so on '' . 
  because , well , that 's what happens in practice with all sorts of poor countries , richer people do n't even sell stuff to them because it 's not worth it , or they found better places to sell x , or whatever . 
  basic and stupid example , but nobody really cares to sell ferrari to croatia because even our richer folks are on the mercedes-level . 
  yes , ferrari again has a very specific monopoly for a very-luxury good , they can hike up the prices a lot , sure . 
  but they do n't even care to `` make at least * some * profit '' here when they can sell for full price in usa/germany/etc . 
  it just seems to me that even the ppp per capita 's of various countries would be more even across the world if most companies cared to adjust their prices * enough * . 
  so my guess is that this price-adjustment simply is n't worth it to said companies ... at some point , you need citizens with paychecks that are `` close enough to be worth it '' . 
  and here i 'm not talking about only luxury/monopoly goods like ferrari , but things that count as `` basic needs '' , like electricity cost , or not basic-but-middle class , like tourist travelling . 
  of course , there 's another complication in the works . 
  take china for example , both their gdp and ppp per capita are much lower than ours . 
  however , china is such a humongous market that they have enough of the very-rich people , so exporting costlier stuff to them is again worth it . 
   if your higher salary buys you 5 oranges in the us , it does n't make you richer than somebody in the eu that has a lower salary but who can also afford to buy 5 or more oranges . 
  ok i 'm genuinely asking here , not trying to attack you , i 'm not an economist so i 'm wondering ~ my impression is that nominal gdp is more useful when agreeing to trade talks . 
  ppp shows you more the quality of life , as you illustrated on your oranges example , `` how rich are you - * how rich you live * '' is n't quite set in stone . 
  but . 
  let 's say you 're not buying local oranges or whatever , but for example you 're buying usa 's f-16 's . 
  same usa wo n't really lower the price of those f-16 's just because you 're a country whose nominal gdp per capita is lower , they do n't care that your ppp per capita is n't * equally lower * in comparison ( because it 's adjusted by all sorts of internal things ) . 
  and same goes for all sorts of things that are imported , let 's say that citizens of usa , croatia and ghana pay `` about equally , in percentages '' , for their bread - bread will be much cheaper in ghana than in usa , alright . 
  however , the same does n't work for pc parts or similar . 
  like , i 'm a trader looking to export stuff to all sorts of countries . 
  is n't it more sensible to look at their average wages in dollars/nominal gdp per capita ? 
  because obviously i care to make as much money as i can , and so then why would i want to lower my prices to the point they 're affordable to whatever poorer country ? 
  no , but seriously ... 
  i do n't think so ? 
  the tricolor was definitely adopted from elsewhere ( on that slavic congress , apparently ) , but our checkers - or variations of them , anyways - are way older than that . 
  like , officially it 's been our symbol for 5 + centuries , unofficially longer than that , 10th or 11th century ( though such old information is always dubious ) . 
  but i do n't think we met north brabant at the time . 
  or , like , even if russia stole that too ( ?? 
  ) , we did n't have much to do with them either ( at the time ) . 
  i think russia `` borrowed '' your colors first , anyways . 
  then they said to the rest of us that `` this is a totally legit slav thing now '' . 
  that 's my story and i 'm sticking to it !, 
  strange . 
  i thought this was about even or even smaller than the wave that came from the yugo wars  it is estimated that the wars in croatia , bosnia and herzegovina and kosovo produced about 2.4 million refugees and an additional 2 million internally displaced persons . 
  also , i 'd know a thing or two about being `` overwhelmed '' :  from the perspective of asylum for internally displaced or refugees , croatia took the brunt of the crisis . 
  according to some sources , in 1992 croatia was the host of almost 750,000 refugees or internally displaced , ** which represents a quota of almost 16 % of its population of 4.7 million inhabitants ** keep in mind that during 1992 , we were at war . 
  then , different war :  according to a united nations early march 2016 report 1.6 million people were registered internally displaced by the ukrainian government but you do n't hear daily howling about that , do n't you ? 
  do n't misunderstand me . 
  this refugee/immigrant crisis * is * a problem . 
  but our spastic response to it - or a lack of response , `` la la la not my problem '' - is the bigger cause than the numbers themselves . 
  no , you overestimate the impact of a million refugees on a continent that 's above 700 million in population . 
  bloody hell , if push came to shove , germany alone with its 82 million could absorb this 1-2 million without becoming `` unstable '' . 
  2015 , media was howling about the `` newest balkan crisis created by the refugees '' . 
  they ^ ^ tm passed through my city . 
  * i never even saw them .

  endless blue-sky sunshine just makes me squint like a mole ( i do n't think i could function without sunglasses ) + it heats up everything . 
  mind you , clouds can get dull too when the sky is uniformly gray , but that version appears less often . 
  can confirm , looks like it 's yet another thunderstorm incoming here in osijek atm . 
  i 'm feeling dreadful stages of * promaja * . 
  also , [ zagreb yesterday . 
  oh dear , i 'm an easterner , and i think that your `` but whatabout moooslims '' derailment of the thread is annoying as hell . 
  we get the bloody useless `` discussions '' on immigrants in seemingly every third thread on this sub already . 
  poland dismantling its system of checks and balances is n't the immigrants fault , but the fault of the power-hungry pis . 
  ahhh , ukraine has then recently had just a strange uptick in russian tourists ? 
  please do n't buy into saudi propaganda , it 's fairly embarrassing . 
  can someone give me a tl ; dr of this ? 
  why wo n't usa play along now ? 
  as in , is there a good reason , or is it `` just because '' , or because iran does n't get along with israel , or with saudis , or ... ? 
  ( i have unfavorable opinions on the western support of the saudis , but it 's not like anybody 's asking for my opinion there . ),

  translating to , what , 40 languages ( ? ),

  iirc he was gone for a month or so . 
  one day he 's in slovenia , then the next in rome , then taking a ferry to spain and so on . 
  i envy him a bit . 
  i mean , i could n't imagine sleeping in a bag , or on a bench ... like some hobo . 
  on the other hand , he 's so much freer than i am , both in the amount of money he needs to travel , but also decisions - `` huh that looks like an interesting side-trail , time to investigate '' and so on . 
  + spain and france had a baby ... + ... and it grew up to be an adorable tiny tax haven .
