  but that this mafia also does n't cause wide-spread trouble to the rest , if they fight , then it 's among themselves . 
  probably the worst fires we ever had . 
  not the worst in terms of the dead , that 's still the old kornati fire ( after which we bought canadairs , too many firefighters died there ) , but ~ this is the first fire i recall getting so close to big population-centers ... [ like split . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/tbf815s.jpg ) + luckily , no dead afaik ( except one old man that had a heart attack ) + damage is mostly material , some houses burned down , and not all of them permanently inhabited , lots of olive groves are kill etc + [ drone footage ] ( https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/pogledajte-snimke-pozara-u-splitu-napravljene-iz-drona-1183363 ) of split the day after + [ this happened ] ( https://i.redd.it/f08n8i9j8caz.png ) + it turned out that the football fans - torcida in this case - are more useful than the government + as were the civilians , defending their home and city with buckets , fire hydrants , whatever + pm rather stupidly called the reaction to these fires overblown , said that they 're `` attractive to the media !, 
  '' , and of course ... he 's been misquoted a hundred times since then , '' ... such attractive fires we had '' + so the main problem was n't that we did n't call on neighbors to help , but - the goddamn bura wind which meant that their planes would have been grounded , same as ours + \\* shakes stressed-out fist at the wind * + some of these fires have been/may have been human-made + some slovenian firefighter was vacationing around tisno when it burned ... as he came back home , he gathered handsome donations in firefighting equipment for tisno . 
  his reasoning boiled down to `` fuck politics , shit 's on fire yo ! '', 
  + and as we put our fires under control , sent canadairs to montenegro ... busy time on the whole coast . 
  and also , montenegro is seeing the first benefits of nato membership , i think nato was first to organize help . 
  ( though also ukraine and israel and switzerland helped them iirc . ), 
  not sure how true this is , all i 'm saying is very 2nd hand from my friends who moved to ireland ~ they say the biggest problem group in ireland is the irish . 
  and this is kinda related to ireland importing so many workers from all over eu . 
  they say that the pro-natalist measures mean that the state gives you somewhat handsome money for every kid you have , the child benefits , right . 
  so , if you have 3-4 kids , we 're talking decent paychecks , assuming that you do n't spend a lot on luxuries . 
  so ... that means a number of young people not working which sounds neat , but - it 's not good for them , long term . 
  imo people need to * do something * with their lives . 
  & nbsp ; or , it could be the weather . 
  or brexit possibly messing up the border with ni . 
   we ask the turks to do it for us because we do n't have the courage to physically stop the migrants . 
  we do n't even that courage . 
  we ask the turks to do it * because they can * . 
  because turkey has land borders with the middle east on which it can pull an orban . 
  greece ca n't do that on its problematic borders , because they 're made of sea , you know . 
  `` defending '' in that case tends to mean `` drown them '' , if your notion of courage is that ... and it 's not an `` ask '' but a `` trade '' , remember ? 
  turkey is n't doing it because we begged nicely . 
  we bought them with deals ... so , there 's your eu border-defense . 
  oh , their voters might . 
  well , looking at the total gdp ppp instead of per capita makes it even more unfair . 
  take out romania , poland and sweden from that list ( sweden is an arbitrary decision on my side , you can exchange sweden for hungary or czech rep or greece for example , all of them are around 10 million ) . 
  the remaining countries put together are about equal to germany in population size . 
  if you add up everyone , you get 150 million people ... less than `` 2 germanies '' . 
  my point being , sometimes `` country '' is about the size of a berlin suburb . 
  and watching absolute gdp or ppp is misleading , unless you 're making a trade agreement ( this is where china is a beast ) . 
  per capita tells you more about the actual well-being of the country , and ppp per capita at that , because gdp per capita tells you little of the costs of living ( in both , china is ... pretty poor ) . 
  [ such is life in eastern yurop  . < ] ( https://youtu.be/wdqayc1sr7g?t=22s ), 
  fires in the south , floods in the north , hurricane level bura wind , droughts , hail , storms ripping trees , biblical mosquitoes , up to 3 meters of snow in the hilly parts , occasional earthquake , oh and also a post-socialist society that sometimes still finds it relevant to argue about wwii . 
  also i have n't even started on the neighbors !, 
  and people wonder why we walk around with a resting grumpy face , like we 're peeved at the world . 
  bah , rade is `` that generic slav stereotype '' is so many movies , no point blaming slovaks for adopting him . 
  exhibit a : [ boris the blade ] ( http://www.imfdb.org/images/1/1d/s-borris.jpg ), 
  but if a group consists of mostly men , then it 's no surprise it has a disproportionate amount of rape suspects , no ? 
  i mean , we 're not inventing hot water here , all over the world , men are much more likely to be accused of that . 
  i looked up these stats yesterday , for example the immigrants from my country are about even in gender , so the statistic for them is basically the real picture . 
  but for a counter example , someone pointed out that the usa group has a disproportionate number of army men , so ... obviously that will skew the average ( not just because they 're men , but * army * men ) . 
  if the mena region is uneven in gender , the statistic needs to be taken with a grain of salt . 
  now , if you got them to be even in gender , it * could * turn out that they 're higher than native germans anyways . 
  but that 's guesswork , not fact . 
  gah alright , i failed to see things ( \u0e07 ' \u0300 - ' \u0301 ) \u0e07, 
  no , something like 74 years ago . 
  if you 'll throw out random whataboutism , you should at least educate yourself enough to make it stick . 
  that 's a common narrative among the `` poor oppressed '' redditors here , as far as my experience goes . 
  and it does n't hold water . 
  you get banned if you act like a pig to your fellow redditors ( general civility rules ) , you post bullshit without source , brigade from t_d and so on ... and you deny genocide , go too far in cheering eugenics , foul stuff like that . 
  meanwhile , anti-immigrant sentiment is alive and well . 
  to the point where people * almost * suggest things like ethnic cleansing , they do n't put it in such words of course , but weasely stuff like `` it 'd be nice if we could just deport them all . 
  them being the criminals and the radicals * of course * . 
  what do you mean , we ca n't figure out who the radicals are without legal due process ? 
  ehhh , we 'll find a way ! '', 
  your comment has amazingly little to do with the question asked . 
  unless i 'm failing to see things , bosnia also is n't counted . 
  greece neither , if you count it as balkan . 
  also slovenia and albania . 
  ( i do n't know what counts as balkan . ), 
  [ also , yeah , averages might get skewed . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demographics_of_germany#foreign_nationals_in_germany ) ( but i am suspicious of op 's stats , same as you . ), 
  [ myself , sometimes i give in and listen to stuff like this ( . _ . 
  ) ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dllpp9hltuk ), 
  tell everyone how not-balkan you are ? 
  hmmm . 
  i was going to blame ex-yugos ( that 's who our non-eu folk are anyways ) , but slovenia has them too afaik . 
  guessing , guessing ... the difference is in the reasons they live here and in slovenia . 
  people basically go to slovenia to w\u00f6rk . 
  here , they stay more out of inertia or whatever , `` been here since grand-grand-grandfathers time !, 
  '' , and `` here '' would largely be the krajina region and easternmost croatia , around vukovar & co. . and those are ... well , they 're mostly poor af . 
  few jobs . 
  but ... that does n't even make sense . 
  ok , maybe it does for netherlands , they had some colonies ( though afaik they never managed to hold onto them for long , how much damage did they even cause ? ) . 
  i guess it would apply for belgium because of congo , ok that was bad . 
  but when did sweden colonize africa ? 
  had a lot of black slaves ? 
  had a civil war in regards to slavery ? 
  how could sweden have the lack of black rights when it - well , it did n't have blacks . 
  iirc there was some ugliness regarding the roma people , but then again , pretty much all of europe had some ugliness regarding them , so it does n't apply - all of us should have `` white guilt '' . 
  or maybe i missed some historical lessons . 
   do you think any of your friends have been repressed jobs wise out of interest ? 
  maybe . 
  but it 's complicated . 
  so my friends , well they 're genuinely interested in being what they are - news reporters , english teachers , actors , etc. 
  however , when we discussed why they never got this interest/willpower to go into technical sciences ( barring 2 of us ) , their reasoning went like `` meh , math/technical/etc was so boring , i think i 'm no good for it ! '', 
  but the thing about them finding math boring is ... * that was true for everyone * . 
  i do n't know what it is about math-teaching being so mind-numbingly boring in elementary and high school ( and most of stem , actually ) , but it just is in my experience . 
  my college teacher taught me more interesting math in one year than all my teachers in the preceding 12 years combined . 
  so everybody had either bad grades or limited/bored understanding of the more technical stuff by the end of high school . 
  the difference is that boys powered through that fact anyways , maybe because they 're more used to having lame grades so it does n't discourage them , maybe because of the expectation-thing . 
  `` gah , i 'm not signing up for foreign language , it 's all girls there ! '', 
  or something like that . 
   yeah i have a lot of friends and family like that , it 's really frustrating , i just want to slap them and tell them that they 're good enough to do whatever they want haha here 's to the two of us spreading the understanding that the computer is n't actually a magical mystery box !, 
   i know both of those people and i honestly think that that is how it is these days . 
  maybe it is different where you live . 
  ha , i know a few examples too . 
  woman in it here , man that was a sausage fest xd and my rants/suspicions on the nurture-thing partially come from that .
