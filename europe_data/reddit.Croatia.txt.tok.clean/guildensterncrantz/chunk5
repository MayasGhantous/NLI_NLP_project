  also , [ croatian spring ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_spring ) - `` cultural and political movement that emerged from the league of communists of croatia ** in the late 1960s ** which opposed the unitarisation and called for an economic , cultural and political reforms in sfr yugoslavia and therefore more rights for sr croatia within yugoslavia . 
  in 1971 , the yugoslav authorities suppressed the movement by force . '', 
  that breakup was a long time coming ... 
  ok , correction : all sides are whitewashing what they did in the war . 
  i mean it 's ridiculous that today you ca n't even get some approximate number of victims . 
  i 've seen `` records '' bandied about , for example the sao-krajina exodus , it goes something like : 120k or 200k ? 
  that is not a small statistical error . 
  rome was n't built in a day and all that , negotiations and peace take time , but it 's been more than 20 years and we still ca n't cooperate even as far as getting the numbers to be even remotely close/correct . 
  on the other hand , while i know that all sides committed war crimes ( especially in bosnia ... ) , i think that concluding `` everybody sucks '' is also misleading/not telling the whole story . 
  true on the face of it , but if of the 3 sides , one commits 80 % of the crimes ( another * estimate * i 've seen ) , then throwing them all in the same box is n't helping . 
  or , you can look at it this way : montenegrins were the ones that shelled dubrovnik ( for the most part ) . 
  how come pretty much no one is salty at them nowadays in croatia ( while the same is n't true for serbs ) ? 
  probably because of history lessons . 
  mine went something like `` so bosnia was settled by croats ( and serbs ) , was part of different kingdoms , then ottomans came , part of the earlier population converted , they 're the muslim / ** bosniak ** now '' . 
  problem is , there were separate bosnian kingdom ( s ) even before ottomans came ( iirc ) , so we ca n't really whine `` kebab gib back croatian clay '' . 
  then people point out that various part of croatia also had their separate kingdoms that united later , politics ! = ethnicity ( true enough ) , but ... if several centuries of different politics are n't enough for a country to get its `` grownup national id '' , usa should n't even exist . 
  it 's a silly argument . 
  [ i think montenegro is the coolest ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3fwavjskm8 ) ( at least , from the ones i heard ), 
  `` bo\u017ee \u010duvaj kraljicu '' ( \u017e -  first sound in french jean , \u010d -  german tsch ), 
  well ... most of the campaign promises are either very bland ( same program everywhere ) , or they 're deeply unrealistic . 
  there are problems that need to be worked on , but on the other hand - how much can any government change in 4 years ? 
  some upwards trend is expected , but such improvements are never easy or quick . 
  plus , i think politicians are trying to convince the people that they are more important than they are in reality . 
  they 're not kings , they 're not feudal lords , they 're not even dictators , and yet they promise ~ ~ stuff ~ ~ nonsense as if they are . 
  the world does n't exactly work that way anymore , way too many checks and balances - which is good on one hand , because dictatorships are obviously bad . 
  on the other hand , i do n't recall anyone ever asking me to vote for the ceo of the [ biggest company in croatia . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agrokor ) in other news , that company is in dire straits at the moment , because its leadership was too greedy - too many debts to repay . 
  now banks are taking over ... 
  i have n't voted for these foreign bankers either . 
  and yet they own the things that matter more , which makes them more powerful than any pm that comes and goes . 
  that 's not the real problem . 
  i mean we barely had 54 % on our last parliament elections , good luck getting 50 % for eu . 
  those that did n't vote are fairly easy to shut up with `` why did n't you vote , then ? '', 
  ( for those that feel like they have no one to vote for , as in `` the right is corrupt , the left incompetent '' , we even have a new-ish crackpot party , they can catch the * protest votes * . ), 
  my impression was opposite . 
  to be more specific , afaik all such tests need to be as unbiased as possible in regards to education - you mostly do n't answer knowledge-questions , but riddles , and pattern-riddles at that . 
  the idea is to measure how well/fast someone recognizes patterns ( so again the test may not be entirely fair because some people solve such riddles for fun , meaning they can use experience in the test ) , solves problems that they presumably have n't met much in school/irl etc. 
  because there 's no point in testing knowledge , for that we have school tests . 
  though to be more specific again - i remember the test had several * types * of puzzles . 
  and then when i 'd get to for example question 3 . a ) , this would be the first i 'm seeing something like that , but by 3 . b ) -  3 . h ) , i 'd solve those faster than 3 . a ) , cause it 's more of the same thing . 
  so they do test knowledge-application in a very specific way . 
  are n't the results always age-adjusted ? 
  as in , if you measured an average kid vs an average adult , the kid would turn out to be an idiot - our brains are developing all the way to age 25 ( iirc ) . 
  that 's why the tests may be similar , but the scores are adjusted to the same age group , for better context . 
  ha , possible :d it could also be a matter of concentration . 
  the test i solved in the hospital as a kid , could be that i was just sleepier/less relaxed than at home ( what with the psychologist flipping papers in the same room , occasionally looking at me etc ) . 
  i mean these tests rely a lot on how sharp your brain is in the moment , i can see a lot of night owls tanking the tests that are organized in mornings \\ ^ ^, 
  whenever one of these `` iq tests '' asks a lot of general knowledge , especially usa history - it 's bullshit . 
  in general , iq tests need to have as few knowledge/word questions ( especially questions in a foreign language , or * english spelling * ) as possible . 
  stuff like [ raven 's progressive matrices ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=raven%27s+progressive+matrices&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjjiyxlxi3tahucqzokhatgatmq_auiccgb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818&amp;dpr=1.13 ) and similar pattern-riddles should take a lot of space in it . 
  in general ... maybe try finding mensa tests on their official websites for your country ? 
  [ this one for croatia ] ( http://www.mensa.hr/glavna/iq-probni-test ) looks fairly similar to how i remember the legit test-by-psychologist i solved looked like . 
  only ... either i grew smarter by 12 points since i was 13 , or that test is off by 12 points : '' d, 
  i read somewhere , how when it comes to iq , it 's `` important to have enough '' , as in - be at least average ( as most people are ) or maybe a little above average , but being a genius is n't that helpful for most things . 
  wo n't necessarily make you richer/more successful , or happier ... and i seem to remember that a lot of those mensa folks do n't get along with most of society all that well ( on average , again ) . 
  ah , i read the map wrong , thought the chinese purple is lower than euro/anglosphere blue . 
  and thanks for linking the listing , that 's what i was looking for . 
  ... yep , it does n't make sense . 
  look at that , equatorial guinea has an iq of ** 59 ** . 
  this is down syndrome territory folks , til there are whole swathes of africa drooling all over the place . 
  this is frankly disgusting . 
  i 'm not sure about that one . 
  that lynn and vanhanen study ~  ** for 104 of the 185 nations , no studies were available . 
  ** in those cases , the authors have used an estimated value by taking averages of the iqs of neighboring or comparable nations . 
  then there were some dubious results , [ in africa particularly . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/national_iq_per_country_-_estimates_by_lynn_and_vanhanen_2006.png ) i ca n't find it on a quick search , but i seem to remember that most african iq 's were waaaay below 100 in that study , somewhere in 60-80 range . 
  imagine that , a country where the * average * iq is 70 , which means that the majority of your population is somewhere between `` borderline deficiency '' and `` definite feeble-mindedness '' . 
  like ... what the hell ? 
  do there people even understand that 60-70 is where someone can call you a * medical retard * ? 
  how would you have anything resembling society if that 's half of your society ? 
  and then this methodology looks strange , too . 
  do n't know what they count as past studies , but looking at education results is misguided at best . 
  everybody knows that it 's not necessarily the * smart * that finish colleges , but the * hard-working * . 
  the iq test i solved in a hospital as a kid had a lot of raven 's progressive matrices and similar in it , because the point of such testing that you may as well be illiterate , what 's measured is how fast/well you can think , not * what you know . 
  * edit : looking at the map again , so most of africa is way below 100 , and china and india are n't doing so well either . 
  again , what ? 
  can you even get the `` average world iq is 100 '' if those 3 places , containing almost 4 billion people , is on average below or way below 100 ? 
  depends on how you look at it . 
  if you 'll go by just how much whatever country gets/gives to the eu funds , it 's no loss at all ( but then neither are some other countries already in the block ) . 
  if you 'll look at the broader picture , eu may end up surrounding a bunch of small and hopelessly unstable mafia states , which is no good for anyone . 
  i went to a jesuit high school ( gymnasium ) , not because i 'm very religious , but because it was the school with the best program in my city . 
  no regrets - the people were cool , and basically everyone from my class is a doctor/teacher/engineer / etc now ( i 'm actually the black sheep cause it took me a while to get my degree ) . 
  but that 's because the teaching in the school was secular , aside from religion being one of the mandatory subjects ( that was the easiest class we dozed through ) . 
  tl ; dr : `` religious '' schools are ok if their management is mentally in the 21st century . 
  huh , interesting . 
  how does that work out ? 
  cause 4-yo sounds too young to me , by attention span if nothing else . 
  is it more like preschool ( kids learn some letters , numbers and basic facts , but it 's mostly learning through play or just playing ) , or more serious - books , homework , very little scheduled `` play '' ? 
   maybe big reserves means the money is not being put to good use ? 
  could be ? 
  i mean obviously the swiss have all the money in the world , their case does n't tell us much . 
  and it looks like there is some vague correlation between more reserves -  richer people ( nordics are green as usual , greece is red as usual ) , but it 's not as strong as it usually goes in such maps . 
  the most glaring example is us and slovenia , they 're years ahead of us in most things . 
  idk why slovenia has such small reserves , i can only say that for everything that does n't properly function in croatia , our financial sector has always been sound . 
  the `` central monetary authority '' , our hnb ( national bank ) has been very cautious/stubborn since the beginning ... perhaps too cautious ? 
   so , my country has less money in the bank per capita than i do ? 
  i am gon na go out and celebrate . 
  buy myself that ice cream i was saving for . 
  you 're from uk , i think ? 
  so , that 's the spirit - always look on the bright side of life ;d,
