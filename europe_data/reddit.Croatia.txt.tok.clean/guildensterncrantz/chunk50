  and proven to the point where you ca n't argue that `` society is to blame '' . 
  and alright , those two even make sense from an evolutionary perspective . 
  but the differences in stem participation ? 
  far too many variables for my liking . 
  if women are inherently `` inferior '' in stem , why does their participation vary so much depending on country ? 
  there 's an interesting line along the old iron curtain , the ex-commie block usually has more even male/female participation in stem . 
  why is that ? 
  * if biology is the deciding factor * , why are russian women more active in stem than for example uk women ? 
  i can think of more than a few * social , man-made * differences between russia and uk , but that 's exactly the problem , if the different participation of women is largely affected by their society , then you ca n't in the same breath argue that `` nooo , it 's all about biology '' . 
   until macedonia invades greece and you can stop right there . 
  macedonia ? 
  attacking greece ? 
  that 's like a poodle attacking a german shepherd . 
  i think people need to be careful about `` biological differences '' because it 's a chicken-and-egg argument in regards to `` nature vs nurture '' . 
  as far as i 'm aware , zagreb for example responded immediately . 
  sent help as soon as they were asked . 
  and they were asked to send help ... last evening . 
  so this point about `` been burning for 3 days '' does n't stand , fires in dalmatia happen literally every summer , and dalmatia - that is , local forces - manage to deal with it nearly every time , no help needed or asked for . 
  how are the rest of us supposed to know that * in this specific instance * , the situation was/is worse , if we are n't informed of it ? 
  if we are n't told to send reinforcements ? 
  it 's not like us continental folk are strolling around the area , making judgement calls on the situation . 
  and i 'm not talking about index alone , the biased cancer that they are . 
  ( same as most of our news-sources , they 'll all just biased in different ways . ), 
  i 'm talking about * everyone * , i was updating the live thread on r/croatia last night , and half of the tweets relating to for example #split or #dalmacijauplamenu were political grandstanding , unrelated bullshit . 
  i see you only read the clickbait headlines . 
  or biased pieces that have little to do with `` actual reporting '' . 
  he said that these fires were * attractive to the media . 
  * which they certainly were and are , so much clickbait , so many vultures eager to assign blame instead of , you know , doing their goddamn job - reporting !, 
  or trying to help . 
  no , scoring political points by blaming the opposing politicians , and gathering likes on facebook , is apparently more `` important '' . 
  no casualties , as far as i know . 
  well , they did find one old man dead , but it appears to have been a heart attack . 
  the stress , probably . _ . 
  all in all , given the size and speed of the fire , we got off - lightly . 
  hope you manage  and it 's mostly under control by now . 
  problem was : fires breaking out all over the place , over-stretching our response units , and the blasted bura grounding the planes during a lot of yesterday . 
  so that 's how the fire reached the outskirts of split & co. . . late evening was then `` far too exciting '' . 
  but , ground units kept it from spreading further , and then the wind died down today , so planes could do their work better . 
  it 'll still take a few days work to put out the smaller fires in the middle of bumfuck nowhere hills , but - we pulled through , for now . 
  we do have enough . 
  iirc we 're actually one of the better countries in that regard , we have more than our size would suggest - and we often borrow our canadiars to neighbors . 
  problem was the very strong bura wind which meant these planes could n't fly half of the time . 
  the ruling coalition is as wobbly as the fellowship . 
  plenky can only dream of having some ring of power . 
  ohh , good :d last i heard was that you were asking for nato help , and nato was like `` errr , who has planes they can spare ? '', 
  is it a useful plane at least ? 
  like a canadair or whatever . 
  as in , is this nato genuinely being useful ? 
  * not anymore , that fellow stopped updating it last night . 
  that was a * live thread * that reported every single report and rumor we could find . 
  including all the comments from people who presumably live close to the affected area . 
  it 's not like mods and/or the sub asked for id 's like in iama . 
  and rumors were reported because official confirmed news can hardly keep up with all the developments , situation changes every half-hour . 
  and the portals and the tweets we followed , half of the time they were reporting - * unconfirmed rumors * . 
  for one thing , forest fires in the south are a common occurrence during summer . 
  they do get bad sometimes , as in `` spreading a lot , reaching villages '' and so on , but ~ nothing on this scale so far , as in , a big city like split being endangered is a first for us . 
  ( or at least , it 's a first as far as my memory goes . ), 
  hijacking this comment : there 's drone footage in [ this article . 
  ] ( https://www.vecernji.hr/vijesti/pogledajte-snimke-pozara-u-splitu-napravljene-iz-drona-1183363 ) shows the size of the burned area in/around split . 
  filmed at noon today . 
  it was an honest question , no need to get hissy . 
  it 's not like random countries do n't ask for help with stuff like this , bloody hell montenegro was asking yesterday iirc . 
  our problem with this particular fire was the goddamn bura wind which meant that our planes could n't fly half of the time . 
  and since you understand us perfectly , you know that people were asking for `` source ? '', 
  immediately . 
  and the person who even started the whole conversation said `` look , i 'm just sharing * rumors * , does n't mean any of this is true '' . 
  well actually , the civilians reacted very well last night . 
  for a start they listened to authorities , as in `` they did n't panic even with scenes like the one above '' , they did n't clog the roads with cars trying to run away . 
  kept calm , closed the windows as they were told to do , turned down the water consumption in parts of the city that were n't affected , etc. 
  then , the blocks in split that were endangered , like kila , as in `` they fire was basically there , at the edges '' ~ without prompting by anyone , and before the firefighters came , they organized themselves and started spraying water from the hidrants all over the place , soaking the ground and whatnot . 
  this seriously helped slow down the fire-spread . 
  same for people in villages/hills , iirc they just used buckets there . 
  then , the football fans also organized themselves . 
  first it was the torcida ( locals , fans of hajduk ) , then their rivals from zagreb/dinamo - bad blue boys - and so on . 
  that lot contacted the firefighters who then further sent them whenever needed . 
  i heard that even the ultra tourists helped  & nbsp ; tl ; dr : so , if you happen to be somewhere close to the fire , you can help . 
  you just need to pay attention to what the authorities are saying first . 
  one of our firefighters chimed in a while back on r/croatia . 
  he said something along the lines of `` it 's a 0 to 100 job '' . 
  as in , vast majority of the time , they just gather dust and receive a decent paycheck all the same , easiest/best `` job '' in the world . 
  but then , a few times a year , it dials up to 100 - you 're expected to react fast , stay calm , work crazy hours because when fires start they usually start in too many places and/or they spread so fast in the local area that support from the rest of the country and the neighbors is delayed ... and risk your life . 
  and imo , our firefighters do it very well , up to that `` risk your life '' bit . 
  so , i honestly do n't mind paying them to `` gather dust '' the rest of the time . 
  they more than earn it . 
  [ ... dead serious !, 
  ] ( https://www.europeanbestdestinations.com/best-of-europe/best-hidden-gems-in-europe-2015/ ) ... i mean . 
  * hvar * is hidden ?? 
  it 's so `` hidden '' that its major is now introducing biblical fines for the sodoma & gomora type of tourists overrunning it . 
  i do n't even know . 
  ninja edit : [ though i 'm more going off from what people that browse r/travel tell me . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6lu81v/croatia_the_hidden_jewel_of_europe/djwnbpl/ ), 
  not now . 
  the roads are either : a ) too close to the fire , or b ) too busy with firemen and people helping . 
  the last thing they need is panicking tourists clogging up the way . 
  if evacuation becomes needed , those in charge will organize it . 
  yeah , as of now , * very unconfirmed * - but yes . 
  there 's a rumor going around about one of our neighbors . 
  a few ( ? ), 
  people have been arrested on suspicion so far ... remains to be seen who exactly they are , obviously police is n't saying anything at the moment . 
  and agree , we really do n't need shit like that .
