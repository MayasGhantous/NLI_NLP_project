  i genuinely hope it turns out to be a false alarm . 
  ( but i do think there was a human element here . 
  fire of this size , it 's quite unprecedented . ), 
  the one i linked is called `` biology in the balkans '' xd and the neighbors - [ you mean this ? 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/zkb8g7a.png ) ( since we 're here already , why is bulgaria in a bad mood ? 
  or - a bully ? 
  never heard any stereotype like that irl . ), 
  the frequency does seem greater . 
  and this is the first time a major settlement has been endangered here . 
  i mean , forest fires in the south during summer have become almost no-news . 
  they get close to some villages , a few houses or cars burn down , lots of material damage , sometimes firemen die , though that 's thankfully rare enough . 
  a big city like split ... our 2nd biggest ... this is unprecedented . 
  basically , with this fire , * everything that could go wrong - did . 
  + [ geography now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slvmp7zbbku&amp;index=6&amp;list=plr7xo54pktt-h8t-dtr4mxy0_mpbwukhw ) says they 're a perfect destination for `` tripsters '' : tourists who are `` so over '' all those well-known locations that are `` sooo yesterday '' . 
  ( i wonder how much of that is his american pov . 
  non-euros sometimes still unironically call croatia `` hidden '' . 
  i believe bulgarian coast has n't been hidden to romania & co for ages . ), 
  + serbia & co sometimes rant about `` backstabbing '' , though i 'm not sure who exactly backstabbed whom because these accusations seem to fly from all sides of the balkan wars . 
  fortunately croatia did n't have anything to do with that bit of confusion . 
  + and that 's basically how we roll with bulgaria : we do n't . 
  too many mountain ranges between us , do n't have much to do with them . 
  like , the last time we went to war was ... [ more than a thousand years ago . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian%e2%80%93bulgarian_wars ) we shared a border at the time , apparently . 
  and also - protected serbs/serbia ( ? ), 
  in a bit of historical irony . 
  + they had a few respectable empire-attempts that lasted a while ... and then the ottomans came . 
  + invented glagolitic and cyrillic alphabets . 
  they get very salty when credit for cyrillic is given to russians . 
  ( side-note : croatia used glagolitic all the way to 20th century , in liturgy at least . ), 
  + if they pass us in hdi/ppp/gdp rankings in the future , our stunning governments finally wo n't have citation needed for `` well , there 's worse than us in eu ! '', 
  anymore . 
  + launched their first satellite recently  + [ random relevant polandball ~ ] ( https://i.redd.it/u8k4l1858gux.png ), 
  gah that 's one of the more ridiculous things . 
  whenever there 's a fire , your first thoughts go like `` save the people , save the houses , save the power-plants '' and so on . 
  and now a blasted * missile base * needs to be rescued too , because obviously we do n't need to add ... missiles exploding ... to the problem . 
  it 's like something out of a surreal horror movie  . <, 
  to repeat myself ~ for everyone close to that area : ** get water , charge your phones , pack up the essentials and be ready to go !, 
  ** solin is apparently already without electricity , split is hit-and-miss , no power means water-pumps not working !, 
  this is n't the time for selfies , folks !, 
  [ this fellow is updating maps as the news come . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/6nuzqs/a%c5%beurirana_karta_po%c5%beara_svakih_par_minuta/ ) black is `` houses burning '' , red is `` confirmed fires '' , yellow is `` unconfirmed fires '' , green is `` situation under control '' . 
  ** edit : ** map is n't being updated anymore !, 
  it appears that the situation is mostly under control . 
  do pay attention to news in the live thread on r/croatia and other such sites . 
  what witchking said , however ~ some of the roads are currently closed . 
  so , check the situation tomorrow . 
  tourists and random people who for whatever reason are n't following the live-updates in news ~ if you happen to be anywhere near split or the fires in general : ** get water ** , charge your phones and/or random batteries you may need , be packed and ready to go . 
  parts of split have lost electricity by now , and that means no power for the water pumps !, 
  firefighters , mountain rescue service , army support , volunteers - it 's not enough . 
  the goddamn wind is constantly changing direction . 
  and the canadairs can barely fly in these conditions . 
  also now the leftover mines appear to be blowing up . 
  [ sky over split .

  & nbsp ; side-note ~ if this is man-made - as it tends to often be , either intentional or some moron throwing away a lit cigarette butt or similar - * goddamn you . 
  unfortunately , this is n't even news anymore . 
  i ca n't remember when was the last year we * did n't * have forest fires in the south . 
  when i was a kid , probably . 
  they just become newsworthy when they ca n't be put out in 1-2 days and/or they swallow houses . 
  or worse . 
  and it 's getting worse - by degrees - every year , no matter what we do . 
  and this whole global warming business has only started . 
  we 're doomed : <, 
  [ lovely cake too < 3 ] ( https://tortekolaci.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/kolac-karpati.jpg ) ( sorry , just wanted to share that there 's an awesome cake called karpati . 
  everyone needs karpati in their life ! ), 
  dictatorship , i 'll give you that . 
  ( though some eu countries do n't have much to boast about there . ), 
  core values ? 
  i do n't even know what those would be ... outside of `` let 's profit together '' . 
  nowadays it seems to me we 're arguing about what our values are even supposed to be every other day . 
  does it turn out , in a plot twist , that * arguing * is our core-est value ? 
  mmm , tourism is something like 20 % of our gdp . 
  so , obviously not enough to keep us afloat or make us rich ( nobody except island micro-states can get rich from tourism anyways ) , that 's industry-exports still , but it helps . 
  but i worded that incorrectly ~ all of ex-yu does n't have that many internal resources , except maybe kosovo with its lignite . 
  imo people here are very silly when they imagine that `` omg we could have been the new switzerland/germany/whomever '' . 
  ex-yu can feed itself , it can supply electricity and water to itself , it can also export the extras , but that 's nowhere near some norway in oil or , idk , canada in agriculture or similar . 
  slavonia for example could definitely feed croatia , export extras to serbia , hungary etc. . . problem is , serbia and hungary have their own crops . 
  it 's not a `` get very rich '' field . 
  in regards to motorways ~ you know , when it comes to you and montenegro and even albania , i 'd support us or the eu or both chipping in/helping build the blasted transport infrastructure . 
  our dalmatina cost a lot , and it 's a good road ... and it 's half-empty during off-season . 
  because it 's not connected to greece . 
  same goes for the lack of budapest-osijek-tuzla-sarajevo-split . 
  `` hurrr durrr balkan is the cross-roads of 3 continents ... crossroads without roads ! '', 
   i read somewhere that the croat numbers in bih might fall to below 390.000 at the end of 2017 which is crazy . 
  that might be one way of solving the problem . 
  if the 3 peoples in bosnia ca n't get along , another solution is to have the other 2 slowly emigrate/naturally die off . 
  as harsh as me saying so is . 
  as for the tone thing ~ well ... look at this thread , or many balkan threads in general . 
  it seems to me that some - some , not all or even not most - bosniaks tend to blame serbs/croats for everything . 
  like we all did in yugoslavia , basically . 
  so that 's not a good recipe . 
  and also , imo everyone looks after their own interests , so bosniaks care about bosniaks but not serbs and croats ( and the other way around ) , so if you removed dayton , same serbs/croats would fall into cracks more because they lack the numbers . 
  bosnia does n't seem to have an united identity where `` we 're making the life of * bosnians * better '' . 
  it 's still an us vs them thing . 
  yes , but ~ the old `` load '' gets lighter as time passes . 
  iirc literally all of eu has had gdp improvements in the last year ( or two ? ) . 
  look at what happened and is happening with countries like poland or even romania . 
  you 're all growing , and at a very fast rate , bloody hell even croatia is growing in the last 2-and-some years , despite my government ( s ) being permanently lost in space-time . 
  ( they sometimes still argue about wwii , it 's stunning . ),
