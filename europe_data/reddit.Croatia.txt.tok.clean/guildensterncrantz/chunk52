  afaik spain is very close to becoming a net-contributor . 
  same for ireland ( or have they already officially become a contributor ? ) . 
  a lot of money has been poured into poland , but if the same poland continues its amazing growth , they will become a net contributor in the future too ( i give it 10 years ) . 
  this is actually part of the grand strategy of eu expansion , you remove barriers , the poorer grow , the richer get new markets to expand into , at a certain point the poorer are n't actually `` poor '' anymore . 
  and everyone benefits from that . 
  so , adding the rest of ex-yu in the next 5-25 years is n't the same as adding them 10 years ago , or now . 
  therein lies the problem . 
  or the first problem , anyways . 
  i mean , you have it bad enough with not having that many internal resources , then there 's still lingering war-damage , then before that , something like several centuries of neglect by various empires/unions ... the way i look at it , it 's much easier for croatia to make itself largely interconnected by motorways when we inherited at least 1/3 of them from yugoslavia , unlike bosnia . 
  and this political gridlock does n't appear to be leading you anywhere much . 
  imo dayton was direly needed to stop the carnage in the 90 's , but nowadays it 's not good enough ... and the arguments to remove it trigger the croats and the serbs . 
  because they do n't trust in bosniaks , as the slight majority , not working against them . 
  and to be honest , given the * tone * i hear from many bosniaks - i 'd be wary as well . 
  so ... all 3 sides are to blame . 
  yah but the ones croatia ( and most yugos ) have concern ... a few fistfuls of dirt and a tub of sea , basically . 
  they 're positively tiny , and they do n't actually interrupt the functioning of these states . 
  ( i mean , those disputes go so ignored in practice that some madlad czech proclaimed `` liberland '' on one of the no man 's land danube islands . ), 
  cyprus - i think they were accepted not just because of greece 's backing , and their strategic position , but because the politics in regards to turkey looked more optimistic . 
  there was more hope the issue will be resolved peacefully ... which probably works against serbia , tbh . 
  something like `` we 're not importing * yet another * frozen conflict , not trusting these people will resolve it once in '' . 
  well ... croatia joined in 2013 , in the middle of the eurozone crisis . 
  when i look at the news of that time , the narrative was `` ohh dear lord eu is falling apart , what do about pigs , the end in nigh '' and so on . 
  and i 'm not saying that eu managed to resolve all the problems of 4 years ago , but - it has n't fallen apart . 
  even brexit may end up giving us incentive to rally , in the long run . 
  and more importantly , the eu barely notices that croatia joined . 
  cause we 're small , do n't drain a lot of funds , do n't have a lot of `` gastarbajter '' to export ( statistically speaking ) , do n't make a lot of trouble in general . 
  and this newest expansion also did two things : make the eu look better ( `` see , someone still wants to join ! '' ), 
  and pacify the remaining non-eu somewhat ( `` they have n't totally forgotten us '' ) . 
  so , for example letting at least * tiny * montenegro ( it 's like , the size of a london suburb ) join in the next 5 years would work as a good signal to the rest . 
  poor bosna , can only into relevance when both sides start ranting about `` gib rightful clay !! '', 
  they have it - * the worst * . 
  nobody listens to what they want , and yet they 're geographically too interesting for their own good . 
  hmmm , you have n't annoyed me yet either xd & nbsp ; no , but seriously , i think that even if someone has an agenda , they need to be careful to make solid arguments . 
  in regards to serbia , talk about \u0160e\u0161elj or the war or corruption or whatever , not silly claims like `` omg serbia will ruin eu '' . 
  as if any of us yugos have the power to do that , we have n't * ever * been internationally relevant outside of tito using the narrow opportunity in the cold war . 
  ( the surviving non-aligned movement of today is basically irrelevant . ), 
  and . 
  us croats in general have some triggered people who see serbocommunists in every shadow , but it appears that we have nothing on bosniaks . 
  it just gets cringey tbh  . <, 
  hm , that assumes yugoslavia could have handled * democracy * . 
  which is basically the opposite of what happened . 
  old non-democratic communist party splintered along state/ethnic lines the moment we got the opportunity to actually elect people . 
  and those splinters had very different ideas on how to run the place , starting from `` more or less centralization ? '', 
  also , there was serious economic trouble ... which imo started the whole thing , i do n't think people mind `` being oppressed '' as much when their wallets are full . 
  ( see : the middle east petrostates , china , etc etc. ), 
  also , the cronyism and/or corruption which the party established and we inherited . 
  `` be good with the party and you 'll get a job . '', 
  the problems we have today in large part come from inheriting that . 
  funny how the old yugoslav communists `` converted '' into fine patriotic capitalists , no ? 
  :p the party is dead ... long live the party !, 
  let 's talk realpolitik instead of `` fine ideals '' for a moment . 
  why would serbia sanction russia , when it 's not in the eu or nato yet ( and wo n't be for some time yet ) ? 
  russia is one of the few countries sticking up for serbia in international politics atm . 
  soooo ... why would they not just lose those 5 % but also a political `` friend '' for the sake of , what , getting a `` good boy ! '', 
  from the west ? 
  same west is n't planning on letting serbia join in very close future . 
  when the time comes for serbia to join - meaning , after they resolve all the chapters and the problems with kosovo - then they 'll join the sanctions . 
  ( i put friend in quotations because - countries have no friends , only interests . ), 
   because uk looked after it 's own interests . 
  serbia looks out for russia 's . 
  you 're still not making sense . 
  you think your common serb will get any say in how serbia votes when in eu ? 
  because they 're the ones that have this wrong idea that `` russia bestest most important friend ever '' . 
  serbia 's politicians will be the ones voting . 
  and they know exactly what is and is n't in serbia 's interests ... translation : it 's not sticking up too much for a distant country with a gdp the size of italy and falling political significance . 
  [ serbia 's export destinations . 
  ] ( http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/srb/show/all/2015/ ) ( that is one fascinating site . 
  look at export/import destinations for various countries , * it explains so much . 
  i 'm all for good serbia-bashing when there 's room for it and i 'm feeling argumentative , but you 're not making sense . 
  serbia will bring stagnation , discord and downfall to eu ? 
  even if they wanted to - which they do n't , they can see how the economic winds are blowing - they ca n't . 
  eu already has quite a few more massive problems than a country the size of serbia ... like terrorism , brain drain , bad integration of certain minorities , russia and turkey and usa and uk and mena making problems every other thursday , greece drowning in debts , unemployment , automatization and globalization destroying industry , the mess that is eurozone , etc etc etc. 
  none of that ruined it yet . 
  and i do n't think it will in the future . 
  if you think that * serbia * will somehow tip it over when neither the uk nor poland can ... dude . 
  your propaganda is showing . 
  keep in mind that the divisions in eu are already - too many . 
  in regards to russia , the problem is n't so much your size and power ( or the lack of it ) , but that you would n't be the first russia-friendly country with veto power , and plenty do n't want to make that group any bigger . 
  when it comes to accepting your entrance in eu ( which all countries need to do for it to stick ) , i do n't think germany will be your first problem because of your friendship to russia . 
  germany is ... * odd * when it comes to russia ( like , pushing the sanctions/the talk against them , while in the meantime they 're building nord stream ii ) . 
  it 'll go like : poland , baltics and co look at serbia , see that it 's friendly to russia , and say `` veto ! '', 
  and they , as a block , are already significant enough . 
  bah , some of the new words we get are closer to ... invented . 
  regardless of how the people feel about it , pc parts/it in general is a fine example . 
  years after the nerds adopt `` hardver '' and spread it among the people , they ^ tm come up with `` o\u010dvrsje '' . 
  because * muh language purity * . 
  and my college professors ask us to not use that cringe because it makes them die inside . 
  other stuff is more our words or the words we used to use before the yugo standardization , like for example the names of months .
