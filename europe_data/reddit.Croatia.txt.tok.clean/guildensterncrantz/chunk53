  now , the more philosophical question is : what is this union worth ? 
  as in , until which point can every country protect its selfish national interests - where do you draw the line in `` this will piss off my allies too much , not worth it '' ? 
  in this specific case , how much does germany benefit from cheap russian gas , and how much is it damaged from the growing divisions and distrust in the eu ? 
  we all need to remember that the eu is * not * a charity organization of bleeding hearts . 
  we 're all here because we benefit one way or another . 
  so , in a cold * pragmatic * sense , to protect our own interests , we need to make this union functional . 
  and it seems to me that the smaller , more short-sighted , country-specific interests get in the way of that often . 
  or ... `` that russian gas will have little worth if the union where you 're making most of your bank falls apart '' . 
  fwiw , i think quite a few people are just as annoyed by the endless echo-chambers regarding `` the immigrant apocalypse incoming hide yo wife hide yo children , is n't islam the worst , look at what erdocrazy said today , president twitterbot does n't get the eu does he , is eu actually a merkelreich , who is and is n't a putinbot , breakfast means breakfast , more g\u00f6tterfunken ?? '', 
  and so on . 
  if you spend a month or so on the sub , you 'll know all the arguments by heart . 
  endless , useless arguments on issues so complicated that all the politicians and experts of this world do n't know how to resolve them ... given to redditors who seem to vote only by feels . 
  and the feels look like `` the daily two minutes hate '' to me . 
  do n't get me wrong , there has been an unmanageable shitposty increase in `` x of europe '' in the last few days , but ... such threads often give interesting information . 
  like examples of what the national cuisine of iceland is , who the great heroes of poland are , discussion about that . 
  if you make up your mind on such long-term and vital decisions regarding your country by reading * reddit comments * ... well . 
  i do n't know what to tell you without giving offense . 
  look , i 'm not part of the pitchfork emporium that proposes we should just drown people , or invade libya , or whatever . 
  there are many laws that put the eu between the rock and the hard place , * and these laws are very much a good thing * that should n't be callously thrown away . 
  however . 
  how can you say this :  neither australia , nor the eu , nor italy was/is actually threatened financially , socially or in any other meaningful way by refugees . 
  ... with a straight face ? 
  do n't you understand what 's going on ? 
  europe is by far more prosperous than africa . 
  it will be by far more prosperous than africa for a long , long time yet . 
  if random people from shithole , africa who have no prospects of anything resembling a decent life * know * that europe will take them in , what do you think will happen ? 
  actually , it 's not `` will happen '' . 
  * it 's already happening . 
  * they come , in increasing numbers , every year . 
  and this will not stop until either of these two happens : + we stop them from coming ; + europe is n't more prosperous than africa anymore . 
  we could help africa grow ... however , for the time being - the next several decades at least - it 's far more likely that europe becomes `` kinda like africa '' if we have another world war ... or we `` take in '' so much of africa that we 're now also just another shithole . 
  we ca n't handle such an influx of people . 
  would n't france troll them more ? 
  is she `` ultranationalist '' ? 
  or is she acting to look out for germany 's interests ... and/or keeping her ear to the ground in regards to what german citizens want ? 
  in this specific rant of mine , they want cheap gas that wo n't be interrupted by `` russia 's issues with its neighbors '' . 
  and then , germany is certainly not the first in line when it comes to any possible aggression , unless france or denmark attack it , which is an absurd notion . 
  sooo ... why would your average `` hans '' on the street give 3 shits about some distant poles or baltics ? 
  to the point of risking death ? 
  as i noted in the end , this is certainly not just germany 's problem . 
  see for example italy being left to basically fend for itself when it comes to the migrants . 
  or greece drowning for the sake of paying back debts to banks and/or richer states . 
  or uk rage-quitting over `` dey took our jerbs ! '', 
  or hungary and poland ranting against `` the eu '' , by which they mean `` the merkelreich borg '' , all for the sake of `` muh sovereignty '' which translates to ... 
  i do n't even know , dismantling the constitutional court ? 
  using eu funds to finance anti-eu propaganda ? 
  it seems to me that half of the states are ranting against each other for one thing or another . 
  ( and then those that actually largely behave , like romania and bulgaria , go resoundingly ignored . ), 
  reminds me of yugoslavia . 
  nobody is buying into this `` brotherhood and unity '' thing . 
  nobody can agree on how to reform this awkward union . 
  so yeah , i do agree with what the writer said about eu having serious weak-spots , but i 'm not very optimistic on everyone 's willingness to actually make this thing work . 
  the stuff the article states seems paradoxical/incomplete information . 
  so * common defense * is cited as something the vast majority of citizens support . 
  meanwhile , here 's the [ latest poll ] ( http://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p2.jpg ) in regards to `` would you defend nato allies under attack by russia ? '', 
  how can we trust in eu-defense when you get information that only 40 % germans favor actually defending the east , if push came to shove ? 
  and spain and uk are n't much better off . 
  france barely goes over 50 % too . 
  it seems to me that people say they `` favor '' common defense , but they do n't ... think about what that actually means ? 
  which is literally `` would you defend your allies ? 
  '' , no way around that issue . 
  then , * energy security * is something we apparently favor too . 
  i suppose that the easiest way to translate energy security would be `` have as many internal resources as possible , and that which is imported , needs to be imported from reliable sources . '', 
  which russia with its gas ... is n't . 
  regardless of how * cheap * their gas is , i do n't think anyone here forgot that `` incident '' a few years ago when they stopped delivery in the middle of the winter , and half of europe had a crisis . 
  and all over some politicking in regards to ukraine , before the war even started - perfect example of * blackmail * . 
  and so ... the 3 seas initiative is trying to build an lng connection between poland and croatia , and obviously many of the vulnerable/russia-dependent states in between . 
  keep in mind that lng 's are a beautiful thing because they can receive gas from just about anyone , so fewer blackmail possibilities by any * one * state . 
  the commission is supportive enough to partially finance the project . 
  and yet , on the political stage , germany frowns ( because nord stream ii ) , while trump 's usa is full of praise . 
  the likes of * donald trump * shares our interests better !, 
  so again , same as for mutual defense , it seems to me that people may be responding without thinking . 
  `` energy safety , yes yes , that 's very nice . 
  but not if it personally inconveniences us in any way , money is more important than safety ! '', 
  seems to me like eu citizens are largely in favor of having their cake and eating it too . 
  ( and not just the west , lord knows some of the east also sometimes has issues when it comes to `` solidarity '' . ), 
  i 'm starting to grasp why the polish call croatian `` the un-cute version of czech ''  . < also , yes . 
  `` knedliky '' , [ that 's so adorable , ] ( https://i.imgur.com/hiirm.png ) i feel like pinching cheeks < 3, 
   you guys do fine on your own ... there goes cunning plan no . 
  mods ~ there 's a new one growing , `` foods of europe '' . 
  make a megathread for that , keep this one , and so then we have two top threads as `` food , poop '' . 
  you know it 's perfect !, 
  hm , this is interesting . 
  i mean - genuinely interesting . 
  would you consider uploading the whole post to r/croatia ? 
  and/or r/travel and such , though i think for those , an imgur album would be better , put the comments below the pics . 
  attention span of redditors ... is maybe somewhere around 40/50 pics maximum i think , assuming that they 're good pics with the commentary broken up . 
  like for example for samobor , you can give one of the town itself with `` so , went to samobor '' , then next is the old castle , then next is the krempita ? 
  stuff like that . 
  r/europe might be interested too . 
  you can put links for the agencies/guides you had in a comment . 
  title it something like `` took an adventure trip to cro and bih , pictures with specific commentary/advice here ! '', 
  what i 'm thinking is - since you already did more/better than the usual `` cruiser crowd viewing of tourist traps '' , why not farm your well-earned karma ? 
  worse countries joined eu before we did . 
  our entrance in the eu took a decade or more , delaying us even further without excuse - we solved all the chapters - would have been hypocritical . 
  so , the problem is then in the eu 's eastern expansion since year 2000 ? 
  people argue it should n't have been done , because of problems like hungary and poland . 
  the argument that the eastern expansion should n't have happened works out ... if you think eu is some sort of * charity organization * or * exclusive club of perfect countries * . 
  it 's neither . 
  richer countries wanted to expand their market - and their political influence .
