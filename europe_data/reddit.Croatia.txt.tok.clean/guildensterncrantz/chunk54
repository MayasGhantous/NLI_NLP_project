  the whole eastern block , it would n't have ever become some kind of `` west-allied germany '' , because turkey or russia or whomever would have gotten to them first . 
  and finally , when it comes to `` stability and problems '' . 
  uh , the so-called pigs are all much older members than we are , so much for stable economies . 
  emigration ? 
  we 're a tiny nation whose gastarbajter are hardly noticeable in statistics . 
  politics ? 
  well , excuse me , but it 's not here that parties/people like le pen , wilders , orban , farage and so on have any relevant political success . 
  i sort-of agree with you , there are some topics that rarely end well ( especially anything regarding immigrants/refugees !, 
  ) , and the common talk about the yugo wars is seriously tiring even to me , much less people to whom the topic does n't matter , but ~ illuminating discussion about it can happen . 
  [ exhibit . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/5dlsdl/nsfwtoday_croatia_marks_25_years_of_fall_of/da5j1id/ ) i 've never seen anything like that irl , for which the first reason would be logistics - it 's difficult to have the different sides even meet face to face . 
  so ... thanks , reddit . 
  good question ... 
  i do n't know . 
  guessing : they count them as foreign if they do n't have our citizenship ? 
  which happens fairly often iirc , so regardless of how they identify and when they moved out , they do n't count if they 're not officially our citizens . 
  so those with dual citizenships may count as domestic ... one of the reasons i 'm guessing that is the fairly small number of bosnians , who - in my impression - flood our coast . 
  quite a number of bosnians have dual-citizenship . 
   '' come here . 
  we are the most exclusivist destination in europe . 
  only a very few get to enjoy our superior services . '', 
  warning : that may end up becoming false pretty fast . 
  we went from `` omg undiscovered '' to `` omg so touristy '' in less than 20 years . 
  and then the tourists that had n't caught the `` yeah , they 've been discovered '' memo complain ... about their fellow tourists . 
  at some point , also expect them to start complaining that [ you 're not `` eastern european '' or `` exciting '' enough . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/shitamericanssay/comments/6jkmwt/arent_you_all_russian_or_something_like_that/ ), 
  oh , yes - it does . 
  ( source : i mod a few other subs . ), 
  basically , when you ban someone , you have the option of determining how long the ban will last . 
  a few days , a few months , whatever . 
  if you leave the field empty , that 's translated as `` perma-ban '' . 
  once these days/months/whatever pass , the redditor is automatically unbanned , mods do n't do that manually - and they do n't get notified either . 
  ( though we do have the option of keeping mod-notes on people , that 's a mod toolbox add-on . ), 
  side-note , mostly unrelated ~ i remember you !, 
  just checked the tourist megathread ( your comment is still the 2nd most popular !, 
  ) , you 're that solo-traveler guy i marked as `` adventurist '' in my mind . 
  have n't heard an update , soooo ... how did you like your trip in general ? 
  some people linked it in this thread already , but here goes again : [ bbc 's death of yugoslavia ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dds9m7osvog&amp;t=5s ) is a solid start . 
  imo it lacks perspective by the end , was filmed in 1995 shortly after dayton was signed , so obviously at the time it was n't clear how dayton would work out , the later conclusions reached in the hague court and so on . 
  and it obviously lacks the conclusion that happened in kosovo in the end . 
  but for what it is , it 's very good . 
  5 hours give you so much war-footage , so many interviews with all the main actors ( who are surprisingly candid here , i guess it 's because they lacked perspective too - did n't have the time to get defensive about the hague accusations etc ) . 
  for something shorter , this [ askhistorians long answer ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/askhistorians/comments/64i9f6/how_did_the_balkans_become_the_region_of_europe/dg2nxag/ ) is good , explains that - incorrect - meme about balkans being `` unusually '' prone to ethnic conflict , explains quite a few reasons for juga 's break-up and the wars that followed . 
  oh , they 're supposed to be trialed and punished , no argument on that . 
  but i do have a mild disagreement about `` war in general '' . 
  consider this : to `` take '' any country , you must take its cities , obviously . 
  not just because of their infrastructure , but because armies do n't exactly neatly line up in some empty filed , like a dumb hollywood movie . 
  so ... what happens as you take these cities ? 
  civilians flee , civilians die , and in quite large numbers . 
  `` collateral victims '' is what they 're called . 
  and yet , people go to war anyways . 
  perhaps it 's because they watched too many hollywood movies . 
  or maybe they think they 'll , what , aim better ? 
  or they relativize it , thinking `` better theirs than ours '' or `` better save the many instead of the few '' or whatever . 
  and then , some of them just do n't care because they 're psychopaths ( war-volunteers do tend to have a disproportionate number of them ) . 
  obviously organized genocide , ethnic cleansing , war crimes in general - it is n't `` necessary '' to win a war , not a legit military tactic . 
  and of course it 's supposed to be prosecuted . 
  but the notion of a * clean war * ... 
  i do n't think it exists anywhere outside of theory . 
  or some future where drones will be * that * precise . 
  maybe . 
  that is , yes you 're right , croats are mostly catholic , serbs orthodox , bosniaks muslim . 
  but idk ... 
  i think there are better reasons for us to `` be different '' than religion which was n't taken very seriously in commie yugoslavia anyways . 
  ( that is , it was almost banned . ), 
  if you look at history , croatia and slovenia leaned west not just because of rome/catholicism , but all those long centuries of unions with hungary/austria/both ( and occupation by venice along the coast ) . 
  while serbia leaned east towards constantinople , religion is again one element , but imo more important are geographic/economic proximity . 
  then bosnia was split apart between those two political poles/was part of croatia and serbia in more ancient history . 
  then ottoman invasions , again differences , croatia 's modern borders is basically where they were stopped long-term . 
  and given more than a thousand years of these differences , you have this vague idea of `` pan-slavism '' that 's based on ... language and geographic proximity , mostly . 
  meanwhile , in early 20th century , the economies and infrastructure of these republics were very different . 
  [ exhibit a. 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6duphu/literacy_rate_in_the_kingdom_of_yugoslavia_1931/?ref=search_posts ) by the end in the 80 's , the differences in gdp were still big ... it 's kinda like `` western and eastern europe '' nowadays . 
  i see people on both sides in eu ( and outside of it ) harping on and on about `` cultural/religious/attitude differences '' , but i like to look at the money first . 
  because i think the well-being of the commons , and the different interests by country/corporation/whatever are usually the * real * reasons for these so-called divisions . 
  it 's just that saying `` well , serbia wanted to keep the big/rich lands because money '' or `` croatia/slovenia figured they 'll be richer if they split off '' sounds so mundane , does n't it ? 
  everyone likes more noble sounding excuses . 
  [ 13,8 million foreign tourists last year . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tourism_in_croatia#statistics_by_year ) in a country of 4 million . 
  that 's a rate of ** 3.45 ** . 
  and this year !, 
  first 6 months , [ tourist arrivals up by 22 % compared to last year ] ( http://www.total-croatia-news.com/travel/20206-record-tourism-results-posted-in-first-six-months ) . 
  through our long history , there were many attempts at colonization here ( some succeeded ) , but anschluss-by-towel must be the most bizarre yet . 
  edit : dropped a million, 
  spare me . 
  most of the greater powers always treated us like different degrees of shit . 
  it 's simply because they could and can . 
  take a present example , the terrorist attacks happening in the west . 
  can you imagine how those news would be treated if it was balkan ? 
  something like `` hurr durr * savage * balkan being savage ! '', 
  compare average wage , ppp and gdp per capita , hdi and so on . 
  there 's a reason croatia ( and slovenia ) got into eu before the rest . 
  and in any case , throwing even the remaining states into the same box is silly . 
  montenegro and bosnia for example , the way they function is at least as different as it is similar . 
  or , in other words ... most of eeu has worrying brain drain . 
  ... and ? 
  does that mean that for example lithuania is now `` like balkan '' ? 
  apples and oranges imo . 
  kosovo is firstly complicated because it was legally a part of serbia , similar to for example croatia and dalmatia . 
  all kosovo had going for it on paper is the old autonomous status ... which does n't apply for republics like montenegro .
