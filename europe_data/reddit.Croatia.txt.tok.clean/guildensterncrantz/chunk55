  as for the rest ... the split with montenegro was civil because serbian relations with mn were and * are * civil . 
  because of history ... and the fact that mn is so small in both land area and population it - triggers no-one on balkans . 
  as for why relations between for example croatia and serbia are bad and were always tense : blaming it on something simplistic as religion is silly . 
  from the start , serbia wanted more centralization in belgrade , croatia less . 
  that 's about good old * power * . 
  neither would have minded if the other one was as * agreeable * as montenegro . 
  it 's ok . as a kinda side-note ~ i 'm actually very salty at what the bosnian croats did in that war . 
  i mean , me and my folks here in slavonia basically did n't have anything to do with it , and i guess that bit of ... * bullshit * when these croats turned on you in the middle of the war was maybe somewhat morbidly `` fixed '' because they made peace later and fought with you against serbs , but still . 
  what the hell . 
  i mean i can sort of guess that nobody knew what to do with bosnia in the 90 's , and these croats probably figured that the bosniak side is a sinking ship , but . 
  no excuse for the crimes . 
  and in some political/whatever sense - very bad form . 
  backstabbing  . <, 
  right , but to answer both you and / u/hey _ you_asked ~ i vaguely remember that war ( i was a kid ) , my parents & etc remember it very vividly , for rather obvious reasons . 
  the propaganda/news at the time always went like `` serbs are attacking us !, 
  '' , not `` the orthodox are attacking us ! '', 
  yes , the religious figures blessed the guns and all that rot , but i think you 'd find it hard to find many people who thought `` i 'm gon na kill these people because they pray to a wrong god ! '', 
  it was largely `` i 'm gon na kill them because they 're croat/serb/bosniak '' , or `` this is my land , not theirs '' , or `` i heard that they are killing our people '' , and by we/they , the division is ethnicity . 
  i mean , atheists were killed all the same . 
  or people whose ethnicity does n't correspond to the `` expected '' religion . 
  for example of wars in balkan , you could call the ottomans `` religiously motivated '' because there , religion was used as the excuse for land-grab in a much greater measure . 
  probably the difference between temporary ban and perma-ban . 
  `` very , very banned '' is probably perma-banned with not even the slightest chance of appeal . 
  * one idiot is talking about bleiburg . 
  which is neither the time nor place , it 's off-topic , and in any case , regardless of how you view bleiburg , it falls within the wwii-aftermath directly , so the whole nitpicking point about the title - `` what is and is n't unrelated to wwii '' - does n't stand . 
  you are aware that these bosniaks were n't some `` immigrants '' there ? 
  as in , they lived in bosnia for centuries , and serbs had basically zero cause to `` remove them '' , aside from good old land-grab ? 
  but the yugo wars were motivated by ethnicity and/or land grab . 
  religion is a very distant 3rd . 
  good old belarus , you can count on them being n/a in so many maps posted here . 
  well ... + for an intro , [ geography now ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasqsotxkhk ) is probably solid . 
  ( well , it was for most countries so far , the ones i know anything about . ), 
  + when people are asked `` so which is the worst/poorest country in yurop '' , belarus is one of the more common answers , but . 
  despite being so politically ... weird ... they 're not * that * bad - [ hdi ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_human_development_index ) , ppp https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_sovereign_states_in_europe_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita . 
  if they were in the eu , they 'd be somewhere around the bottom , but considering that the eu is pretty much always in the `` first quarter '' of the world , belarus is n't actually some kind of dank desolate eastern europe . 
  + [ unusually high share of agriculture and * industry * in gdp . 
  ] ( http://imgur.com/a/vejb5 ) + i liked their latest [ eurovision song . 
  ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elqblpcthai ) + i heard they 're making money from the russia sanctions . 
  theoretically eu & co do n't trade with russia ... but they do with belarus . 
  and belarus trades with russia . 
  rumor has it that they 're exporting things like shrimp that 's `` so totally fished in belarus '' and similar . 
  no , that fellow apparently does n't believe croatia . 
  then i pointed out that the project has been approved by the ec . 
  apparently that 's not enough either , because ec is also `` a conspiracy '' . 
  i mean , this bridge has been in plans for a dozen years . 
  bosnia had all that time to protest to whomever they like ... like the un/international court of justice . 
  they would n't get what they want from un or any international law !, 
  same as slovenia actually , maritime law is very clear about such cases , everybody knows in advance how that judgement would go . 
  and that 's why neither is even * trying * to make a case with icj . 
   serbia did n't exist , croatia did n't exist , bosnia did n't , everybody was everyone in their banovinas . 
  well , how does that not piss people off ? 
  for heaven 's sake slovenia and croatia joined juga because they figured there 's safety in numbers and they expected they 'd get more autonomy than in a-h . 
  these preposterous borders are the opposite of that , worse than anything a-h ever came up with . 
  even serbia was pissed af . 
  that 'd be like destroying the nation-states within eu today , redrawing borders everywhere , getting some half-french half-german `` regions '' for example . 
  absurd . 
  it does n't occur to you that the european commission , which agreed to fund 85 % of this project , had international maritime law in mind when checking all our documents ? 
  even though the only reason that bridge is of significance to the eu is the fact that coastal - and therefore , also maritime - borders are a mess ? 
  you think the commission was asleep on the job ? 
  even though they usually nitpick through all the thousands of pages for every project that asks for eu funding ? 
  if you had read the article , you 'd have found out that croatia agreed to spend all the extra money and time needed so that this bridge gives more than enough room for * every possible ship * bosnia may want to sail there . 
  including warships . 
  do n't you think that 's unfair ? 
  :d i met a number of snobbish slovenians ( whenever there 's any argument , croatia is suddenly `` so balkan '' that it must mean we `` lose by default '' because `` balkan '' ) , but - i met very few slovenians whose main hobby seems to be shitting on croatia . 
  and bosnia , and kosovo , and albania , well you get my drift . 
  few `` internet warriors '' among them . 
  fair enough . 
  forgot about the banovina borders ... mostly because they were reversed later , plus they never looked sensible to me . 
  or well , [ they made sense if ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/banovine_jugoslavia.png ) you 're trying to piss off all the nations in yuga/weaken them etc. 
  that 's why they did n't stick around for very long , nobody was happy . 
  sure he is . 
  but you know there 's a difference sometimes . 
  that one ... in my experience with him , he 's so '' \u010cetnik '' that dra\u017ea would be proud . 
  ( in other news , he thinks that there 's no such thing as a croatian or bosniak ethnicity , we 're all serbs in denial . ), 
  so him being from ljubljana is n't very relevant . 
  eh , they can stall us out of sheer pettiness . 
  or stall us to look more `` heroic '' to their local voters , `` poor bosna courageously fighting evil croatia , alas the western conspiracy did n't like us , victims that we are '' or some such rot . 
  stuff like that seems to be the reason for half of the international arguments nowadays . 
  there 's the darker timeline where they also get some kind of `` chimney '' because fuck us ... slovenia could force us into it with the eu ascension , bosnia ... 
  i do n't know , it can always threaten to fall apart or something , international community sometimes does strange things to `` keep the peace '' in ex-yu . 
  mind you , i think this other option is seriously unlikely . 
  note to anyone thinking about arguing with this fellow : do n't . 
  he 's a serbian troll hiding behind the ljubljana flair ( so that nobody gets extra salty at slovenians again ) . 
  [ latest exhibit . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6m7jss/croatia_tells_commission_to_stay_away_from_border/djzjfx3/ ), 
  yeah , and that arbitration with slovenia just gave them new ammo . 
  after all ... if slovenia can demand some `` chimney '' ( regardless of maritime law on borders ) , why not bosnia too ? 
  or so the `` logic '' goes . 
  as the article states , eu already approved funding for the bridge . 
  so the commission certainly does n't seem to think we 're breaking some `` rules '' with this . 
  [ map . 
  ] ( http://split.gg/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/peljesac-bridge.png ) so the short of it is that croatia has been split for centuries , and the problem of neum was never rectified by a-h/jugoslavija/whomever because - they did n't care enough . 
  so bosnia has this little panhlandle on the coast ... they do n't even use it for anything , main port is in our plo\u010de . 
  and the plans for the bridge have been in the works for a dozen years , bosnia had * more than enough time to complain and negotiate * . 
  and we ca n't build a motorway to dubrovnik and the rest of the far south because the concept is useless - bosnia is not in the eu . 
  no , this is just them trying to hinder us because * they can * . 
  in their arguments , you have `` well , slovenia could , we can too ! '', 
  this is just the first exhibit ( of the many that i expect ) in regards to `` why that shady arbitration with slovenia was a bad idea '' . 
  sharks be smelling blood . 
  germany was waging a war with almost all of europe at the time .
