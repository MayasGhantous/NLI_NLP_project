  it 's about looking good so that we have better alliances on the world stage ... and about trying to pull `` the world '' into a more * sensible * future . 
  more cooperation , more respect , more thinking long-term instead of `` fuck you , i do what i want , i look after only my own interests , might makes right ! '' . 
  such selfish primitive thinking * leveled * europe twice in the 20th century alone . 
  no , i do n't think they 're spineless . 
  you do n't become one of the most ( or most ? ), 
  successful unions/economies if you 're spineless . 
  or stupid , or naive , or a bleeding heart - the world does n't function on `` goodness '' . 
  the problem is that eu is trying to position itself as the progressive voice of reason on the world stage . 
  in rough words , we 're trying to pr ourselves into being `` better '' than usa/china etc. 
  and again , i do n't think that 's because we 're stupid bleeding hearts , but because `` well-mannered and nice '' people do n't pick as many enemies . 
  so the values we promote are n't just good for us internally - our citizens - they 're good for our foreign policy , and adding to it - more of the world adopting more respect for human rights would be good for * everyone * . 
  on a specific example ... eu sinking these boats is a pandora 's box . 
  not just because it 's illegal , but because , let 's say * we * need similar rescuing at some point . 
  you do n't want a precedent where people kill you when you need help at sea , no ? 
  hm , one of the problems i encountered in such mega-rants and/or big discussion topics in my time on r/asoiaf : if you do n't cover all ( or most ) of your bases in the first post , people commenting will attack that which you have n't covered . 
  even if you say `` yeah , side-topic b will be covered in post b '' . 
  imo the 3 stereotypes i talked about are * added up * when it comes to reasoning for `` why balkan is shit '' , if i talk about economy alone , people will go `` but what about war '' , or the other way around . 
  plus , series posts are also difficult because you have to convince people to read the other installments :1 maybe such massive discussions would be better if just the barebones were submitted by op , like a `` let 's discuss balkan in terms of : 1 . war 2 . politics 3 . economy & etc '' ? 
  though i/we would need to avoid the trap where mods go `` this is / r/askeurope material '' . 
  anyways , glad you like it , 
   `` i shudder when i hear statements like , ` we must close the mediterranean route . ', 
  how do you close the sea ? 
  does that mean no longer saving people ? '', 
  that 's exactly what it means . 
  everybody has realized by now that the rescue operations are n't helping , the more you rescue , the more come next year . 
  so eu is now in a very uncomfortable position of having to choose between `` be the bastion of human rights and fine values we 're trying to be '' and `` get swamped by endless numbers of people looking for a better life '' . 
  it does n't even matter if these people are fleeing war or general poverty or both . 
  they will come to europe if they think europe will receive them - in their shoes , you 'd do it , i 'd do it , everyone would do it , it 's a no-brainer . 
  and it wo n't get any better , africa is drying out as we speak . 
  if something is n't done to slow down global warming & co , year 2050 , you 'll have half a billion people trying to move to greener lands . 
  so , now we 're stuck between the rock and the hard place . 
  and i think that in practice , eu will * let them drown * ( and probably say `` oops , accident , what can you do ? 
  '' ) , eu will close ports , eu will strong-arm the origin countries into accepting them back . 
  we just find it hard to `` say it '' , actually honestly commit to doing it , because of the whole `` fine progressive values '' thing . 
  so , everybody is sort-of `` passing the hot potato '' at the moment . 
  but is that sentiment a thing here ? 
  that is ~ yes , i 'd say that croatia has no interest in the extremist lunatics , or trying to integrate/take care of hundreds of thousands of `` refugees '' and so on . 
  these terrorist attacks in the west may bring up `` not this shit again '' thoughts , remind us of ottoman invasions in a way . 
  but , take bosniaks or albanians who are muslim ... 
  i 'm not seeing any significant spike in hostility towards them . 
  cause their islam is n't very relevant , they 're not extremists . 
  so i do n't think people here would hate on turkey * just because * it 's muslim . 
  erdogan is a problem for sure , but he 's a problem in the way vladimir is a problem ( religion does n't really matter ) . 
  juncker is dat you, 
   edit : oh no everybody is retarded . 
  i 'll get you for this hans !, 
  not everybody !, 
  proud staropramen fan represent !, 
  ( just had 2 last evening . ), 
  ... idk what 's wrong with them : <, 
  nah , croatia specifically does n't fall in the general balkan trend when it comes to turkey/ottomans . 
  they did attack us , and we did fight them for centuries ( i mean , our modern borders are basically the old military frontier ) , but they never really managed to have the occupation stick . 
  some parts took a century or two to liberate , and we never got back western bosnia , but that 's about it . 
  so we do n't have some kind of `` well , we 're so messed up because ottomans abused/neglected us for centuries '' like for example romania/bulgaria do . 
  we were with/under a-h and venice , and it shows . 
  and besides , a lot of time passed since we last fought the ottomans , for example the balkan wars had nothing to do with us . 
  so at worst , we 're usually neutral towards modern turkey ( then erdogan came along , but that 's a later story ) . 
  as others say , this is more likely just a troll/freak occurrence . 
  i do n't think so . 
  everyone in europe is looking for their own interests . 
  countries have no * friends * , only interests . 
  and if protecting interests means abusing your neighbors , so be it . 
  and that 's how it was in basically all of european history . 
  eu did a neat trick in that it tied all our wallets - our interests - together , so the `` good old traditions '' of rape , burn , pillage , kill - are n't necessary anymore ( we share resources , so little reason to steal ) , and in fact , doing so would be too harmful . 
  people have n't `` changed '' to be somehow `` good '' , they just figured out a better - more peaceful - way to protect and build their , their country 's - prosperity . 
  as if most people care about nebulous concepts like `` europe '' or `` brotherhood and unity with strangers on the other side of the continent '' . 
  i 'm not very optimistic on how long this supposed `` friendships '' would last if common unions such as eu fell apart . 
  well , self-posts get filtered ... uhh , sometimes ? 
  that is , automod pulls them off the sub , mods need to approve . 
  given that r/europe mods have way too much work , that can take hours , and by that time , the post is buried - the rule of r/europe ( and a lot of reddit in general ) is that you have that 1-2 hour window in which you have the chance to reach the front/hot page of the sub . 
  a post that gets approved 4-8 hours after posting ... may as well not bother . 
  i submitted a single self-post to this sub so far , my rant on the [ hurr durr balkan is that uncle bob europe is ashamed of ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/657x5f/a_strongly_worded_letter_to_the_western_europe/ ) thing . 
  i thought it was a good post . 
  the comments also approved , or at least , they approved of the post , even if they disagreed with my conclusions . 
  i put serious effort in that post . 
  the first few times i submitted it , it took 4 hours or more for it to show up in the / new queue ... it took almost 2 days of me contacting the mods through modmail and coordinating with them so that the post * finally * shows up within one hour . 
  and even then , look at the karma and activity , it did n't quite sink , but it was n't a big success . 
  it could be because r/europe is n't interested in that kind of discussion , or they did n't like my way of writing analysis , but imo the more relevant problem is the * length * . 
  it 's basically an essay , and r/europe ( and most of reddit and internet in general ) has no patience to spend 5-10 minutes reading something . 
  so , pictures and `` omg erdogan so crazy !!! '', 
  it is when it comes to fighting for karma - for visibility . 
  so kolinda went to poland for the three seas initiative meeting , scheduled before g20 . 
  [ trump finally acknowledged her existence ... ] ( https://ip.index.hr/remote/index.hr/images2/kolitrumphinaaaaaaaaaaa.jpg?maxwidth=625 ) and more than that . 
  so you all probably heard how he was full of praise for poland and eastern eu . 
  but , one of the first specific things out of his mouth was [ `` you 're gon na build that lng terminal on krk , croatia , righto ? 
  '' ] ( http://time.com/4846780/read-donald-trump-speech-warsaw-poland-transcript/ ) recap : poland already has its own lng terminal , and one of the specific things the 3 seas wants to do is : build another in croatia , connect those two , make the 3 seas ( baltics , v4 , austria , slovenia , croatia , romania , bulgaria ) less dependent on russian gas . 
  because eeu does n't like/trust russia , or it does n't care for german nord stream ii pipeline where germany gets a more direct line on russia and then resells that gas to the rest , or both . 
  i support the lng plan . 
  the beautiful thing about these terminals is that they can receive gas from just about anyone - usa , canada , norway , qatar , etc etc etc. 
  so , fewer blackmail opportunities for any single country . 
  plus , some money for us in reselling that gas . 
  meanwhile , reactions from brussels and germany are ... not that encouraging , as far as i heard . 
  i find this mighty interesting , that * trump of all people * is the one that 's `` full of praise '' for eeu while the west usually just criticizes - yes , of course he 's doing it because he has gas and weapons to sell , he 's looking out for usa 's interests . 
  but it appears that in this case , * our * interests ( and even safety ) align better with usa than the west eu . 
  * `` nations have no permanent friends or allies , they only have permanent interests . '' * ... or something like that . 
  that 's how you perceive it because it 's true . 
  well , correction ~ people talk about politics and economy as if they 're somehow `` separate '' from each other in the real world . 
  which is bullshit , of course . 
  exhibit a : russian monopoly on gas in europe . 
  russia dislikes something or does something unfortunate ?
