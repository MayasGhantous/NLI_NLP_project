  better tread carefully , annoy them enough and they 'll turn off your heating in the middle of winter . 
  your voters will riot by the 2nd day , so there goes your `` independent '' politicking in regards to russia . 
  ( yes , such a break in the selling of russian gas hurts russia 's economy even more , * but remember the 2 days it 'll take for riots to start . 
  * ) so this new boogeyman ^ ^ 1 `` intermarium '' has a plan : connect the polish lng terminal to the one croatia will build . 
  lng terminals can buy gas from just about * everyone * , this includes usa , canada , norway , qatar , australia ( iirc ) , sometime in the future also possibly israel , cyprus and egypt . 
  so there goes us `` being blackmailed by that one single country supplying gas '' . 
  & nbsp ; 1 : here 's how this article is lying about details to push its * agenda * ~ `` western balkans '' ( or , austro-hungary , that is - croatia , slovenia , austria ) have n't been invited into the `` intermarium '' later , which the author interprets as a mistake , because of serbia bla bla bla . 
  * croatia and poland * started the three seas initiative . 
  in fact , the first meeting was held last year - in dubrovnik . 
  so what you 're trying to tell me op , with this regional-nuts-divide , is that england and benelux have a much greater density of people per capita than for example croatia and spain do ? 
  have to say , i 'm seriously interested in seeing the lng-terminal plan work . 
  recap : there 's already an lng terminal in \u015awinouj\u015bcie , poland . 
  now croatia is supposed to build one on/around the island of krk , which is very close and connected by road with rijeka , a major port . 
  then , better transport links between those two and voil\u00e0 !, 
  central/eastern/southeastern eu ( the three seas initiative ) has smaller dependency on gazprom and russia in general . 
  frankly speaking , to hell with nord stream ii and all the other streams that bypass us and/or give any * one * country dominance/blackmail opportunity , especially one as aggressive as russia . 
  of course trump 's glowing words for the initiative are there because usa is most interested in selling us its gas through these terminals , but the beautiful thing is ... lng terminals do n't really discriminate . 
  unlike pipelines , they can receive gas from all sorts of countries : usa , canada , norway , qatar , i also heard that cyprus , israel and egypt will be looking to sell in the future ( found gas recently iirc ) . 
  so yeah , as far as not just money but also * safety * goes , i think this north-south gas connection would be very good . 
  alright , alright , since you 're a very non-noob tourist . 
  1986 , man i was n't even born yet . 
  what was it like ? 
  ( or if you 've been recently-ish , how has it changed for the better/worse ? ), 
  yeah but , you 're * almost * locals here . 
  especially herzegovinians , i swear a ton of them come down to makarska every other weekend during summer . 
  got ta admit , my first thought was `` stealth serb '' . 
  turned out to be 10x worse , a. . . what do we even call them ? 
  people who hate on own country/people while assuming that the shit they throw does n't end up covering * themselves * as well ? 
  ne , greece has n't been hidden since it invented the western civilization . 
  [ and then , some models have degrees . 
  ] ( https://youtu.be/5bj6eskucbw?t=6m5s ), 
  well fwiw ~ i visibly cringe whenever some tourist complains about tourists . 
  `` omg croatia too touristy '' , i bite my tongue ( well , fingers because keyboard ) not to snap at them like `` you know what would help make the crowds smaller ? 
  * you * not adding to them !, 
  :3 '' however !, 
  that does n't count for v4 , slovenia , germany , austria and italy . 
  you lot `` discovered '' us when we were n't so `` touristy '' , bloody hell even before we existed as a separate country , so you have the right to complain about `` these new crowds , kids these days '' < 3, 
  the trick is ~ moving to new markets !, 
  south korea for example , we were perfectly `` hidden '' to them up until a few years ago . 
  then they made some random * romantic show * here : `` 5 men and 5 women in their 20 's and 30 's embark on a 10 day adventure-packed , matchmaking and heart-breaking emotional rollercoaster ride from zagreb to dubrovnik in hopes of finding their true love amongst team members . '', 
  and that is how we went `` 10k -  almost 400k '' south korean tourists in around 6 years . 
  i do n't even know !, 
  rumored or actually found guilty ? 
  because all the trials that happened later in the end found `` no legit links '' to whatever . 
  i think ^ ^ 1 that 's / u/kontaktnicenter . 
  ( so , beware . 
  there 'll be so many mental gymnastics in his arguments that trying to parse through them will give you a headache . ), 
  new alt obviously , old account appears suspended site-wide . 
  hmmm ... does that count for ban-evasion , to be forwarded to admins ? 
  & nbsp ; 1 : i only saw the tail-end of kc 's ... trolling . 
  slovenians attacking him because he 's trying to hide behind ljubljana flair and it embarrasses slovenia . 
  anyways , the rhetoric is the same ( from what i saw ) , plus other slovenians say that 's kc . 
  when edgy `` fuck da police '' retards are forced to visit jasenovac during primary/high school . 
  i mean we do that for vukovar already ( and i support it ) , why not jasenovac too ? 
  also pointing out with more emphasis how much of dalmatia that pig * sold * to italy . 
  and that he ran away like a coward in the end , i mean even hitler had more `` honor '' than that . 
  and that nazis had to bring him back from italy because they lacked local muppets in the first place . 
  and that if it was n't for tito , we 'd have been under * chetniks * , because that 's what churchill was considering . 
  also , since we all have a consensus on how terrible nazis were , add `` adolf and his lapdog paveli\u0107 '' everywhere . 
  by the end of schindler 's list even , that would be very effective imo . 
  so ... mosquitoes were even worse . 
  is that what you 're telling me , op ? 
  well , damn . 
  and i tagged you as a fun-guy . 
  ( i think it was something concerning the kolinda-vu\u010di\u0107 meme-romance . ), 
  anyways ... well , you had these big protests ? 
  so , that means you all are n't mentally dead , no ? 
  there 's hope yet , 
  i 'd like to actually see a good breakdown of where taxes go . 
  whenever i think of `` public sector '' , for every useless paper-pusher , i get one doctor , policeman , fireman and so on , which are certainly jobs i do n't want to see privatized . 
  so all i `` know '' is that our public sector is too bloated and that bandits like mayors/etc drive cars they should n't be able to afford , but i do n't actually * know * where most of the waste is . 
  if you decided it 's a good idea to fire 10 000 people tomorrow , who would it be ? 
  ( aside from hgk , they can all go as far as i 'm concerned . ), 
  but anyways . 
  i sincerely love the fact that thinking `` better avoid that neighborhood after sundown '' is n't a thing in my life ... 
  i get a lot of `` culture clash '' when speaking with various strangers on the net about that ( especially when it comes to female-safety ) . 
  and i 'm not sure i 'd actually want to exchange that , moving to some country where i 'll be potentially much richer , if it 'll mean potentially-violent homeless on every corner , or where i 'll feel the need to get a gun `` just in case '' etc. 
  pretty much all our robbers are white-collar , the most successful ones we call `` politicians '' . 
  oh , i 'd say that wars and hypocritical excuses for them are basically the only real thing we have definitely in common . 
  nowadays , i 'm way more influenced by usa culture than eu culture . 
  ( and i 'd say that this works for all of europe . ), 
  historical cultural and political impact that built/influenced our nations ? 
  hmm , for us that would be hungary , austria , italy ... ottomans . 
  then for every , idk , german writer whose books we read in school , we get one russian , and yet germany `` is properly european '' while russia `` is n't '' - if we 're going by values such as cooperation , human rights etc. 
  do n't get me wrong . 
  i 'm not denying that euros influenced each other a lot , or that industrial revolution and enlightenment did n't start here , etc etc. 
  but i 'm not seeing this stark line drawn between `` europe '' and `` not-europe '' like turkey/a lot of mena etc , when we warred and traded and were influenced by these groups as well . 
  for me hungary gets the no . 
  1 spot , but as `` non-euro '' as turkey supposedly is , they were a dozen times more relevant for us than the nordics for example . 
  yeah , i just sort of ... `` take it off '' with my fork . 
  i do n't care if that makes me look like a peasant :p, 
  how would you say arguing with croatia has been going lately ? 
  i 'm rather confused , do n't know what to make of your newest multi-kulti pm , kolinda 's pink dress at inauguration , the passive-aggressive ( ? ), 
   tompouce < googles  hmm , yep it looks similar-ish . 
  we do n't do the [ crazy icing ] ( https://hollandathome.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/oranje-tompouce.jpg ) mind you . 
  and as far as i can tell , tompouce is n't made with custard cream ? 
  no i want to try it to compare . 
  a few seconds of googling gives me [ this recipe .
