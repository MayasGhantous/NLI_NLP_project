  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cremeschnitte ) * no , seriously , try it . 
  people talk about our olive oil/truffles/seafood , but krem\u0161nita beats them all handily in my humble opinion . 
  ninja edit : and for all that the coast gets the spotlight , the continental parts are worth checking out too .

  nein how about this ~ we keep dubrovnik , give you the cruiser stampede ? 
   because rural turkey is a middle eastern backwater . 
  that is something that * can * change . 
  greater changes happened in all sorts of countries ... including turkey , with atat\u00fcrk 's reforms . 
  however , turkey halving its population and with it , voting power - would not have happened ( and that is a good thing ! ) . 
  so yes , eu does have legit reasons to quit this charade , turkey was n't willing enough to reform . 
  but it 's highly debatable whether that would have helped .

  but the danube does n't gib iron gates \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064, 
  the shortest way i always saw that ~ religious `` know '' that there is a god . 
  atheists `` know '' that there is no god . 
  agnostics `` do n't know '' whether there is a god . 
  ( yeah , the worst atheists i met are just as silly as some of the worst religious . 
  `` i know '' , yeah you know jack shit , same as the rest of us . ), 
  well , as much as we liked wojtyla , he was n't croatian . 
  heh i think bosnia takes the winning prize for `` most difficult place to be in '' . 
  they 're like the poland of balkans :p mind you , yeah , your ancestors situating themselves around the middle of the balkans ... may not have been a good idea . _ . 
  so as a rather dazed kid , i had this strange idea that albanians were part of yugoslavia . 
  which is n't exactly untrue , kosovo albanians certainly were , but realizing that the country of albania was n't made me feel like my childhood is a lie and/or i might be an idiot . 
  they 're one of my go-to examples when ignorant people rant about `` moooslims ca n't adapt '' . 
   according to a 2010 survey , religion today plays an important role in the lives of only 39 % of albanians , and albania is ranked among the least religious countries in the world . 
  fun fact : they have the [ bektashi order ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bektashi_order ) , exhibit a of how nobody parts a balkanite from his booze :  an imam was preaching about the evils of alcohol and asked `` if you put a pail of water and a pail of rak\u0131 in front of a donkey , which one will he drink from ? '', 
  a bektashi in the congregation immediately answered . 
  `` the water ! '', 
  `` indeed , '' said the imam , `` and why is that ? '', 
  `` because he 's an ass . '', 
  random ~ very pro-nato , looking to join the eu , totally turned towards the west , etc etc. 
  lots of touristic potential imo . 
  also , here i 'm hoping that we all finish the motorways so that we can connect slovenia to greece by adriatic . 
  rumor has it that most of the weed in the balkans comes from there . 
  their own word for themselves is * shqiptar\u00ebt * ( ? 
  ) , but they get offended when yugos call them '' \u0160iptari '' . 
  to be fair , the name does tend to have negative/insulting connotations . 
  it seems that somehow most of the small bakeries in my country are owned by the ( kosovo ) albanians . 
  i suspect a plot , but do n't care enough to investigate - they saved me far too many times i was drunk and starving at 3 am < 3, 
  [ i still unironically think jacques killed the pokemon intro :d ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jivslsnm910 )  insert `` haha \u017dak singing about how he wants to be the biggest '' xd, 
  we could use ... hmmm . 
  `` half a burkina faso '' ? 
  true , true . 
  but is n't danube one of the rare-ish rivers that 's big enough for heavy cargo ? 
  at least in this area . 
  ( just off the top of my head , drava and sava ca n't compare , sava around zagreb is ... just no . ), 
  i feel that this bad connectivity on the adriatic is a problem that 's slowing all of us down . 
  i 'm talking trading with italy , bunch of mena countries etc. 
  hiking in flip-flops , yes . 
  also trying to paddle to islands on air-mattresses ... `` well it did n't look that far '' , they say . 
  we love the czech because they 've been coming here for decades , so many of our high-school trips go to prague , etc etc. 
  but they do keep our rescue-services very busy , the madlads . 
  well , give it a few more years and you 'll pass through exactly zero border-checks on your way to the coast !, 
  some of that would be the falling demographics , yep . 
  both from the birth/death rate , plus the emigration - that lot is n't a burden on their family/the social system anymore , plus they send some money back . 
  but also , our tourism has been rising as usual , every year is a new record . 
  [ oil refining , pharma , ships ] ( https://www.tportal.hr/biznis/clanak/izvoz-nevjerojatno-raste-iz-hrvatske-izvezeno-20-posto-vise-robe-nego-lani-20170509 ) ( looks like the '' \u0161kver '' finally got a grip , thank the sea gods ! ) . 
  also apparently you lot are our 3rd most important trading partner , najlep\u0161a hvala :p, 
  `` hurr durr balkan is the crossroads of 3 continents ! '', 
  [ yeah , crossroads without roads . 
  ] ( https://i.imgur.com/2bskkaul.png ) afaik most of the heavy cargo goes through serbia , and same serbia noticeably has no sea cargo-ports . 
  as far as i 'm concerned , if montenegro/bosnia/albania / etc do n't have enough money to build/finish these motorways on their own , * we should do it for them * . 
  because otherwise our side is gathering dust in the off-season . 
  well , yes i think we should use the beauty of our country as much as we can . 
  and i 'm not just talking the `` sun and sea '' vacations , we also have plenty of interesting history to show ( and not just on the coast !, 
  ) , plus it 's always good when you can offer various activities , from tour guides to sport-y stuff . 
  and for various types of pockets , too . 
  we also have plenty room to expand our tourism to the continental parts + off-season . 
  [ example . 
  ] ( http://www.adventzagreb.com/?lang=en ) tourism so far is around 20 % of our gdp . 
  but that 's a sign of : a ) we 're good at tourism , and b ) we 're bad at most of everything else . 
  look at france which is a touristic giant - tourism certainly is n't 20 % of their gdp ... because france also has respectable industry ( and other services ) . 
  our industry , well some of it was destroyed in the war , but even more was ruined in the bad privatization of the 90 's ( we call it robbery here ) ... of course globalization and robotization hurt us similarly to how it hurt usa & co ( ca n't compete with china and robots ) , but i 'd say that * government-sponsored * mismanagement did even more damage . 
  then examples of how we 're not working properly on everything else ~ we import more food than we export . 
  that 's preposterous , we have enough good soil to feed all of ex-yugoslavia . 
  electricity , our hydro is somewhere at 50 % of our total potential , wind and solar even less , aaaaand we import more power than we export . 
  and so on . 
  and the wonderful thing about relying on tourism so much , all it 'd take is a few isil-or-whomever bombs in the neighborhood and * we 're doomed . 
  oh , problem is that most of the transport work we 've done so far seems targeted at tourists alone . 
  our railways are a disaster . 
  we must be one of the few countries in europe where it 's faster and cheaper to go by bus instead of train . 
  so , we - especially dalmatia , whose ports need better connections with the north - can forget about a lot of heavy cargo . 
  then the motorway we built from zagreb to split ( and a bit further ) , yes it was a good idea , it 's a good road etc. . . and again , it 's way too empty during off-season . 
  because the idea of building an adriatic motorway from slovenia to greece has been `` an idea '' for lord knows how long , problem is , montenegro does n't have motorways , albania is hit and miss . 
  ( and first we need to build the pelje\u0161ac bridge to connect dubrovnik with split - finally . 
  it 's in the works in the next few years . ), 
  and bosnia is yet another disaster . 
  easy enough to finish connecting slavonski brod/osijek to budapest , but connecting osijek to for example split or dubrovnik through bosnia ... well . 
  [ maps . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6g2e31/the_current_state_of_the_european_motorway_system/ ) and also , our too-high motorway tolls mean that people in off-season ( read : no crowds ) rather go by smaller roads . 
  and the whole construction in the 2000 's , well let 's just say that certain amounts of money mysteriously `` went astray '' in strange pockets . 
  that would be the `` steal whatever you can '' thing at work  . <, 
  i know . 
  i 'm joking . 
  well , half-joking . 
  in the 26 years since independence , here 's the `` ideas '' from every single government we had : 1 . 
  defend country 2 . 
  join nato and eu 3 . 
  share touristic pics everywhere 4 .
