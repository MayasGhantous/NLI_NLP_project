  6-7 to 14 here , then it 's off to 4 years of high school . 
  afaik most countries start primary school around 6/7 , though there are some differences in how long it lasts - some have that `` middle school '' between primary and high school . 
  germany has something like that iirc . 
  new map , just europe here . 
  also i changed the colors around from [ op 's link ] ( http://world.bymap.org/financialreserves.html ) , as far as i can tell , in it the countries with more reserves ~ ~ per capita ~ ~ are bad . 
  idk why . 
  [ there you go , ] ( http://i.imgur.com/0fugi1l.png ) / u/stevenfries !, 
  * excuse me if i messed something up , this was done in a hurry . 
  switzerland is funky cause otherwise it 'd mess up the whole color scheme . 
  gim me ~ ~ 10 ~ ~ 20 minutes or so , i 'll make a new map for yurop . 
  that map that op linked apparently goes by total reserves ( instead of reserves by capita ) , and it thinks that bigger reserves are ... worse . 
  * note - i can see that i 'll need a special funky note for switzerland , else the scheme will be all messed up . 
  hm , i 'm lazy so - have any sources ? 
  as in , polls into what brits think about this issue ? 
  personally i 'm split . 
  adding it as a condition in brexit wo n't help imo . 
  and on one hand , greeks should get `` the other half of acropolis '' back into greece ( as the joke went , when i visited ) because obviously they should , it 's their heritage . 
  on the other hand , as someone pointed out in the article comments , one of the big reasons london is such a popular tourist spot is precisely all the heritage they have squirreled away in their museums . 
  ( same goes for rome , paris , st. petersburg , new york etc etc. ), 
  no way i 'll ever be able to visit 100 different cities/countries , so having a lot of `` stuff '' be present in fewer locations is convenient . 
  eh , to be fair , the flag is one of the areas they win . 
  nothing against the greek flag ( personally i think it looks soothing ) , but [ this is way cooler .

  what the hell , you all had the opportunity to use something like [ this ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/vergina_sun_-_golden_larnax.png/330px-vergina_sun_-_golden_larnax.png ) ? 
  ( whyyy not ? 
  it 's so cool ! ), 
  yea you 're right , they are often used interchangeably . 
  but they should n't be , there 's a big line between being proud of the good your country does , and being proud of * everything * your country does . 
  i find that the worst nationalists often call themselves proper patriots , and they use that to excuse or downplay the bad . 
  which i guess is n't a surprise , people like to think they 're awesome , and they identify with groups , so any attack on the group translates as an attack to self . 
  the sad thing is that you 'll never become better if [ `` everything is great '' .

   the troubles thing you mentioned is odd as that is northern ireland not ireland as the other guy mentioned . 
  oh , but ireland was n't exactly rich , no ? 
  i mean the irish themselves were leaving ireland . 
  ex-yuga emigration was usually targeted at countries that were * much * richer than yugoslavia , the point was to make money fairly easily ( language and culture were considerations only after that ) . 
  and yeah afaik germany is still our no 1 destination ( and they tourist on our coast in summer , so i guess that 's fair :d ) , but that 's just business as usual , not very interesting discussion . 
  i think people may get confused by the difference between nationalism and patriotism ? 
  the first is bad , the second need not be . 
  i think that many of the most passionate pro-eu and anti-eu arguments often miss some points . 
  pro-eu or pro-federalization arguments do have a point in that we 're stronger united , people are people wherever you go ( we 're more similar than different , other-ization of outsiders is negative ) , free movement of people and goods is usually positive , but the opposite arguments also have a point . 
  different countries have different needs , one size does n't fit all . 
  speaking as a person from a country that was in different unions with bigger powers * since 1102 * , i can say that historically , uniting into bigger conglomerates is n't always that good . 
  the `` periphery '' is often neglected by the central powers at best , used as a convenient shield or sucked dry of resources/people at worst . 
  and the premise tends to go like `` let 's unite , we 'll be stronger together , * but we 'll all be equal * '' , it ends up being `` hahaha , * some of us are more equal than others * '' . 
  so you have reasonable doubts in the good intentions , equal rights etc etc of projects like the eu . 
  ( power corrupts , bla bla , people usually look out for their own interests first , etc etc. ), 
  personally i 'm much more on the pro-eu side , but it remains to be seen how it 'll work out . 
   one guy asked what the attraction over the uk and germany is . 
  ireland is a more recent trend . 
  if i understand it right , this stat goes into all immigrants that were born in croatia and live elsewhere now , so we 're talking about 60-70 years here . 
  ofc usa , germany , austria etc etc will have far larger numbers , they were popular destinations for as long as we 've been emigrating , and germany & co have n't changed their rate afaik . 
  but , the interesting thing is that ireland only emerged as a popular destination in the more recent years - of course almost no one was moving there 40 years ago . 
  it is extra popular among our youth nowadays , so that fellow did have a good question - why ireland in particular ? 
  as for the immigrant caps , i think everyone may be overestimating their effect . 
  of course it helps that ireland loosened them earlier , but for context , nowadays * we ca n't even visit usa as tourists without a visa * , which does n't stop many of our folk moving there . 
  afaik canada and australia also have fairly bothersome paperwork , still targeted destinations . 
   at the same time , an increasing number of other countries , including australia , brazil , china , and japan , are following the eu 's lead and adopting mandatory labeling schemes for gmo products . 
  this narrows the u.s. farmers ' scope for trade diversion . 
  then it goes on to how the usa farmers are pressed by this : ca n't export the gmo to eu , ca n't export it to other big markets - as stated , china , japan , brazil , australia . 
  those are huge numbers of consumers . 
  and how it is n't logistically easy to produce two sets of crops . 
  also , gmo is n't the biggest , it 's the last example . 
  before that , you have `` environmental protection , health protection : regulation of chemicals , privacy regulation , antitrust laws '' . 
  i 'm around half-way into reading it . 
  this is fascinating , so far . 
  puts into words why we felt like we * have to * join , and it 's not even about external threats attacking us in any `` traditional '' way , like outright war . 
  ( ofc i still have n't come to the weakness/drawback parts . ), 
  yea about mercator , should n't have bought it . 
  that 's when all the banks - except for russian ones - stopped giving him new loans . 
  fast forward to 2017 , and he 's down , apparently said banks will take over the management , restructure the company ( and this in spite of government scrambling to have their own takeover ) . 
  [ it 's all terribly dramatic ~ ] ( http://i.imgur.com/t6jghoc.gif ), 
   like it 's something different . 
  you mean , like poles are n't blowing themselves up in western europe in the name of some god ? 
  what as small distinction that is ... 
  yes , they do . 
  letting them in as registered refugees is one thing , illegal crossings are something else . 
  [ also , thank you so very much for the loan , non-pineapple bros \\ ^ ^ ] ( https://i.redditmedia.com/yncuvp5icg7ebsn1h2k7ueypau-tzky66flpa0eusrg.png?w=309&amp;s=63aae676d15477674954af26c10a7dba.jpg ), 
   `` no you wo n't you bloody ** barbarians ** ! '', 
  you lot and bosnia tickled me pink !, 
  came later to the game , and i remember tiny bosnia appearing beneath the eu flag just as we were battling the void ... they were so innocently safe beneath us ( alas , it appears that france partially rekt them in the end ? ) . 
  then after usa & co finally murdered the void , you lot show up right in the ashes of the center : '' 'd, 
  2011 consensus was 4,28 million , 2016 estimate is 4,19 million . 
  mind you , that 's total population . 
  there are also immigrants/different ethnicities . . mostly serbs and bosnians - their nationality not specified as far as i can tell , but i guess that most would be bosnian croats . 
  the 90 % croats is ethnicity . 
  oh , i do n't know . 
  our own shape is the most ridiculous thing this side of chile , and it is troublesome for transport , security ( ca n't defend our border with bosnia in the case of refugees for example ) and so on . 
  i mean , if you look closely at the map , [ bosnia has a tiny panhandle on the adriatic around neum . 
  ] ( http://www.geoatlas.com/medias/maps/countries/bosnia%20and%20herzegovina/bo372a8/bosnia_phy.jpg ) and this is a huge issue , dubrovnik & co are cut off from the rest of the country , tourists travelling to it must either take a ferry , or pass the border checkpoint * twice * . 
  and we get along with bosnia in all that , but even with good relations , as an eu country we ca n't build a motorway there ( problem would be solved if bih was also eu , but that 'll take a while ) . 
  so now we 're building a bridge across pelje\u0161ac ( and eu is paying for most of it ) . 
  and this is just one tiny piece of land that 's a problem even between two countries that are mostly getting along . 
  i ca n't see bosnia peacefully splitting apart if at least half of its internal border-gore does n't get resolved ... aaaaand that gives people unfortunate war-flashbacks . 
  i do n't see the will for it . 
  [ ha , our oldest models are yours :d ] ( http://www.visit-croatia.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/zagreb-transport-e1407498839298.jpg ), 
  since you mention that , and i 'm too lazy to google , tl ; dr of what 's the thing about germans stealing dutch bikes ? 
  it does n't have to stay that way . 
  belgium comes to mind as the closest equivalent - also a country that 's split by nationality , has more than one parliament etc , and while it may look very strange to my eyes , it somehow functions ( and fairly well , at that ) . 
  but for bih to work , these ... `` multiple personalities '' need to start cooperating .
