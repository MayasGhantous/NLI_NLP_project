  build roads 6 . 
  steal as much as possible 7 . 
  so basically if or when our economy does well/better , it 's in spite of the government , not because of it . 
  did n't our general economy finally start recovering when we did n't have a government for months on end ? 
  that is , we just had those technical-caretakers ? 
  i do n't know about you , but to me that feels like a sign :3, 
  ah , common problem on the coast , especially when it rains ( and the rare times it snows get absolutely hilarious ) . 
  old towns tend to have stone/marble/whatever streets , i guess it 's because `` why not build in stone when you have so much of it '' . 
  ( houses though , they tend to be stone because of strong winds like bura . ), 
  give it a century or few , and that stone has been polished to the point it gets slick . 
  [ for those wondering ~ ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n86pf-wqkrw ), 
  sometimes i wonder how we 're still here , yeah . 
  on the other hand , all these passing empires sometimes drop interesting things while on their way wherever . 
  like burek !, 
  spain has the funniest loopholes , better even than netherlands . 
  so from the source ~ possession :  legal ( private areas only , illegal in public areas ( decriminalized ) , offenders receive an administrative fine . ), 
  possession of more than 70/100gr . 
  ( depending on the autonomous community ) is considered as possession with the intention of trafficking . 
  sale :  technically illegal , but cannabis can be acquired in private smoker/cannabis clubs . 
  selling itself it 's punished by prison in all the ways , even for first offenders . 
  transport : illegal ( decriminalized ) cultivation :  legal ( only for own consumption . 
  if the plants are located somewhere visible from the street/public place , it 's an administrative offense ) so basically you can grow your own weed , as much as you want , so long as you light it up at home ... and it 's not visible from your balcony : '' 'd looks like amsterdam has a rival :p, 
  ha , when i search the wiki source page , the only countries that allow it for religious usage are ... italy , and * jamaica * . 
  [ that 's what the source comment is for . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6kv9b7/legality_of_cannabis_by_country_possession/djp1gug/ ) go ask the wiki editors `` which brain-inhibiting '' they 're doing . 
  there 's a difference between * possession * and sale/transport/cultivation , the massive amounts you link are tied to `` the intention of trafficking '' , which even spain prohibits . 
  albania :  the law of prohibition exists but however with high availability of cannabis plants throughout the country , this law is often unenforced . 
  meh , we 've been `` pretty place that 's cheaper than italy/greece/spain '' for decades now . 
  or even longer than that . 
  the vast , vast majority of our old tourists - v4 , austria , germany , slovenia , italy - i have n't ever heard any particular complaints about them . 
  and recently we 've had an increase in usa , australia , france , far east like japan and south korea - they 're ok too . 
  i mean yes of course the students looking to party will be noisy and messier than usual , and novalja/zr \u0107e beach did sort of `` ask for it '' because [ this is the promotion ] ( https://www.google.hr/search?q=zr%c4%87e+beach&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=x&amp;ved=0ahukewjdjasc0evuahxgnjokhxmldi8q_auicigb&amp;biw=1707&amp;bih=818&amp;dpr=1.13 ) , but you do n't have to act like a pig all over the streets because you 're young and drunk . 
  source : i was young and drunk not that long ago . 
   he 's anti eu ( so are milions of europeans ) , but pro europe . 
  here 's what happens with `` europe '' without the eu . 
  easy pickings who hope that usa - the gentler master - gets there before russia does . 
  or china , or whomever . 
  after the world wars in which most of europe leveled itself to the ground , europe lost most of its power and relevance . 
  the west was * lucky * that they got to be usa 's yes-men ... the east , i do n't think i have to explain what happened to it . 
  eu could put a stop to such a sad state of affairs ( already did , to a point ) . 
  i 'm extremely wary when outsiders who can break any of us separately play `` concerned '' about this `` bad eu '' * which stops them from breaking us as easily because there 's safety and strength in numbers . 
  except the `` free , free shit '' does n't include defense . 
  eu does n't have any kind of functional defense when it comes to its edges like poland , and poland knows it . 
  usa is still more reliable in terms of military defense , regardless of eu 's `` army integration '' dreams . 
  so in this case , yes of course poland is looking into keeping good relations with a vital ally . 
  if the `` rich eu '' does n't like that , well ... spending more on defense and being willing to use it to help poland will be needed . 
  sort of/almost . 
   cannabis in portugal is illegal but decriminalized , having been decriminalized in 2001 when all drugs were decriminalized for possession in the nation , with criminal penalties replaced with civil penalties and drug diversion programs . 
  so it 's not legal like tobacco or alcohol are , but you 're not gon na get thrown in jail ( and * i think * not fined ? ) . 
  instead , portugal got smart and instead of prosecuting random junkies , they help them . 
  ( last i heard , it 's working . ), 
  of course when i say junkies , i 'm talking heavy stuff ... 
  i guess that portugal does n't care about light stuff like weed . 
  yep . 
  this must be the first pattern-less map i saw here . 
  no east/west , north/south divide , nothing on the type of religion or the lack of it i think , no gdp/ppp/hdi pattern , not even [ `` well apparently the atlantic makes you gay '' ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6km2gy/where_europe_stands_on_gay_marriage_and_civil/djn4kdn/ ) . 
  i do n't know . 
  you can hate on weed regardless of where you 're from ? 
  yes , but that counts for all sorts of countries . 
  i 'm going by what 's counted as law and/or noted down as the lack of enforcement ( like albania ) , because it 's in my source , and i ca n't guess how seriously for example bulgaria takes possession/personal use , regardless of the official law . 
  mostly law , but i made some exceptions when the law vs enforcement is neither here nor there . 
  like for example albania , over there it 's theoretically absolutely illegal , but !, 
  nobody really does anything about personal use ( and well , more than that but that 's a different story ) . 
  anyways , netherlands . 
  possession : `` decriminalised for possession of up to five grams ( in case of a police control it is still confiscated ) , for public use and for use in ` coffeeshops ' . '', 
  then sale : `` decriminalized for ` coffeeshops ' '' . 
  and so on . 
  so imo with these loopholes you count for `` legal '' . 
  the only other case like you is spain , and even there going over 70/100gr is counted as trafficking and obviously illegal , then for buying you use some loopholes too , etc. 
  in the honor of greece legalizing the [ medical use of cannabis ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6ksu2h/medical_marijuana_is_now_legal_in_greece/ ) , i made this map because why not . 
  [ source here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/legality_of_cannabis_by_country ) there are dozens of different sets of laws in yurop ( plus their enforcement ... ) , this is by what wiki says is `` official '' . 
  so i grouped them in 9 ( 10 ) different boxes and ordered them around by what i think counts as `` severity '' . 
  obviously , this map can be up to debate . 
  spicy ex-yu slapfight that * does n't * involve serbia , which made the serb redditors feel very strange indeed . 
  it 's the endless border dispute with slovenia . 
  recap : + jugoslavia never settled its internal borders properly , especially not the maritime borders . 
  + so croatia and slovenia have been arguing since independence . 
  slovenia cares because they want access to international waters , which the usual divisions of sea-borders would n't give them ( it usually goes half-half for various bays and seas , bay of piran in this case ) . 
  croatia cares * because of the principle * . 
  translation : because we have other uncertain borders with ex-yugos , do n't want bad precedent . 
  + bunch of agreements in 90 's and 00 's fell through . 
  so slovenia blocked our access to eu because * we 're not friends anymore ; - ; * . 
  ( see : the other reason we care about the * principle * . ), 
  then we agreed to the arbitration because we 're both too petty to resolve the issue on our own , and so they unblocked us . 
  + then in 2015 slovenia was caught trying to influence the judges . 
  to the surprise of no-one , croatia jumped on that opportunity to withdraw from the process , some vienna convention of withdrawal or whatever . 
  parliament voted unanimously that the arbitration does n't exist for us anymore . 
  + slovenia do n't care about that . 
  the court investigated itself and concluded that the court is clean . 
  + this thursday the verdict was given . 
  it 's not actually bad because both sides are mildly instead of strongly displeased . 
  problem is that croatia is like `` what , that non-existent arbitration ? 
  '' , because * principle * . 
  same * principle * means slovenia wo n't hear of trying to settle it bilaterally . 
  + and now , what do ?
