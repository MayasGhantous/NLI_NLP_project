  they 're howling about the moooslim apocalypse as if the 10 million are all muslim . 
  4.2 million of these immigrants * are from the eu * , as the article states . 
  ( this of course ignores the non-eu europe like a lot of balkans , russia and ukraine , plus the turks . ), 
  million-and-some of the recent `` syria , iraq and afghanistan '' were let in . 
  except the african and arabic people that redditor mentions are n't from europe or the eu ... which means they have nothing to do with the eu single market , which only allows the migration of eu citizens . 
  bah , italy looked very anschluss-y that decade ( also , anscluss-y period ) , so us and slovenia thought `` safety in numbers , right ?? '', 
  also , panslavism was a thing in the 19th century in general , and in the same 19th century a-h lost the plot and was pretty mean to us , so fellow south slavs looked like a good safety-parachute . 
  so plenty of our intellectuals supported the idea of the union . 
  i mean , we were n't 100 % for it of course , plenty others hoped that ferdinand would really work on making slavs in a-h equal to austrians and hungarians . 
  but then gavrilo princip literally shot that possibility dead , a-h lost the war and fell apart , and so `` there we are '' . 
  mind you , we soured on yugoslavia pretty fast , sometime during 1920 's . 
  because slovenia and croatia hoped that union would give them more rights and autonomy than a-h did ... and yugoslavia - well , serbia - went like `` lol nope '' . 
  but that 's a later story . 
  hmm , no , i think that with the amount of daily complaining my people create , we should have protests on the scale of romania . 
  ( if only we could wire those complaints to power-generators , we 'd have enough power to sustain half of the eu . 
  complaining is the best national sport we have , clueless listeners would conclude they 're listening to the democratic republic of congo , given the scale of complaints . ), 
  and i prefer to stay here and try to make it better here . 
  and it 's not just the wonderfully big house i 'll inherit from grandma :p i do n't feel like leaving my home to be a permanent 2nd class citizen in some other land i do n't give 3 shits about . 
  and yes , this does happen too much . 
  the german gastarbajter i know ... going into 3rd generation now , and they 're still `` those ausl\u00e4nder '' . 
  the drawbacks make the benefits not-worth-it to me . 
  and my point with linking all those ppp/hdi/etc etc stats was that it is n't actually * bad * here . 
  it could be better , yes of course , but it 's not like people ca n't live decently here . 
  some ca n't i suppose , some want to be rich-rich with low qualifications , some think that 10 000 kuna is n't a decent wage with our costs ( ??!, 
  ) , but the way you speak about moving to ensure a good life for your family , it 's like you think there 's no such thing here . 
  there is , for many , many people . 
  we would n't have been accepted into eu if there was n't ... that 's the point of eu . 
  it 's not some charity for `` those * poor * dears '' :p, 
  i 'm starting to doubt you know croatia as much as you say you do . 
  when relevant protests like the direly needed educational reform happen , * 200 people come * in a city of almost 100k . 
  that is not the definition of `` they fought very hard to make it better '' . 
  that is the definition of a spiritually lazy nation where people expect that justice and richness and all that good stuff from the west will `` just happen '' . 
  so i suppose it 's a good thing the folks are leaving for places where it `` already happened '' , no ? 
  croatia has problems because we - all of we , those that are staying and those that are leaving - let it happen . 
  we let it happen in the past , in the present , probably in the future . 
  we 're either lazy or stupid or both , and blaming `` the state '' for our own failings , for the criminally low voter turnout at elections - * especially low youth turnout * - is preposterous . 
  our politicians suck because we let them suck because we elect them even though they suck . 
  ( with rare exceptions like those 200 that did turn up to protest something relevant . ), 
  and no , i 'm not surprised that my cousin is leaving to work the lamest jobs in some other country even though he could live * perfectly well * here with the more respectable and socially useful job we educated him for . 
  angry and disappointed , yes , but not really surprised . 
  because i know the people here . 
  it appears i did strike an unpleasant chord for you . 
  sorry about that ... though i 'm not sorry for holding my opinion on this nation i know very well . 
   but it 's not a trivial bump in salary ? 
  re-read my comment again , since you seem to be taking this strangely personally . 
  i said that i 'm `` surprised '' exactly nowhere . 
  in fact , i wrote about the passivity of the people here that is the problem . 
  `` you get the government you earned '' , or something like that . 
  the vast , vast majority of people who are leaving for greener pastures did exactly nothing to make this country richer or more orderly , same as those that stay ... actually , worse than those that stay , we educate them first with tax money ( same for healthcare and a dozen other services paid by taxes ) , which makes them a net loss to the country . 
  they 're leaving because it 's the `` path of least resistance '' , as i stated in my initial comment . 
  i have little sympathy for the vast majority of them - `` thanks for nothing '' . 
  but it 's not a trivial bump in salary ? 
  as i said , by ppp ( which is more relevant than gdp for `` quality of living '' , gdp tells you nothing about the costs of living ) , ireland and germany have more than 2x or 3x on average . 
  as for youth unemployment ... ohh , i could go on about that . 
  so you 've lived in zagreb . 
  you must have noticed that basically every single bar/coffee shop is packed full at all times , and plenty of those sitting there for hours are youths ? 
  same bars and coffee shops that are on every corner . 
  do these youths look like they 're looking for a job very hard ? 
  or even working on getting some marketable skills ? 
  it took me 10 minutes in stuttgart to notice that the same does n't apply . 
  i talked about this a lot with my job-seeking adviser . 
  she and all her colleges say that most of the jobless youth are demotivated , as in `` they 're not even trying '' . 
  because they do n't want to work here at all , because of the lower paycheck . 
  they 're waiting for the opportunity to screw off to ireland . 
  and as for the same people whining about corruption ... more hypocrisy imo . 
  `` those that have n't cheated on a test , those that have n't bribed someone to get ahead , raise a hand ... 
  i 'll be waiting '' . 
  people whine about our educational system being a mess ... then you have protests for the exact same education being reformed , and my city of osijek that 's experiencing worrying brain drain - * 200 people show up . 
  * the rest are sitting in some bar , complaining about how `` screwed up this country is '' ... 
  i assume they expect josip broz will reincarnate and `` unscrew '' it , all without them not needing to do a thing . 
  so yeah , croatia has problems . 
  but i 'm not buying into the hypocritical whining about `` it 's all their ^ tm fault '' . 
  let 's go by numbers . 
  if we look at ppp per capita https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_gdp_ ( ppp ) _ per_capita , croatia has 22 795 , germany has 48 111 , ireland 69 231 . 
  so that 's a bit more than 2x or 3x , roughly - fair enough . 
  `` it 's not all about money and what you can buy '' , ok . all that other stuff like what works and what does n't is important . 
  alright ... [ hdi by country . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_countries_by_human_development_index ) that also looks at life expectancy , education and so on , plus income per capita . 
  goes from norway 0.949 to central african republic 0.352 . 
  croatia has 0.827 , germany 0.926 , ireland 0.923 . 
  safety ? 
  [ global peace index ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_peace_index ) : `` peace is correlated to indicators such as income , schooling and the level of regional integration '' , `` peaceful countries often shared high levels of transparency of government and low corruption '' , `` small , stable countries which are part of regional blocks are most likely to get a higher ranking . '', 
  goes from iceland at 1.111 to syria at 3.814 . 
  croatia has 1.665 , germany 1.5 , ireland 1.408 . 
  basically the majority of the relevant stats i can find support my first statement that - no , croatia is n't some kind of `` 3rd world shithole '' , and yes , majority of these people are moving for money alone . 
  and even the money bit - gdp/ppp per capita - puts us into the first quarter as far as countries go . 
  so it 's not about us being `` omg so poor , must move to germoney to live decently '' , it 's about people wanting to get `` so much richer '' , wanting to be in one of those 1-10 countries . 
  i mean ... fair enough , who does n't want to be super-rich ? 
  but the sob-stories do n't check out . 
  not in legit stats ... and not my personal anecdotes either . 
  my bff moved to ireland recently . 
  she got her `` english teacher diploma '' here . 
  that one is obviously useless in ireland ( foreign vs native language ) , so she 's working in burger king now . 
  as for - why ?? 
  well , her so left for ireland earlier ... because he has a high school diploma , that `` 3x the paycheck '' thing . 
  my cousin finished the police academy , it 's decent * guaranteed * paycheck plus plenty opportunity to move up in ranks . 
  he 's talking about moving ... so that he can work in `` some burger king '' too . 
  and so on . 
  bah , my `` just do n't '' was in the sense of `` do n't start this argument again '' because us and slovenia have been arguing about it for * years * . 
  and it never goes anywhere , like most ex-yu arguments .
