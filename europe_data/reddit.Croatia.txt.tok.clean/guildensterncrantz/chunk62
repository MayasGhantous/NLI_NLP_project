  and `` it remains to be seen what will happen '' is true , that court has limited-to-none options of enforcing the decision . 
  commission has n't said anything yet , and signals from separate eu countries ( and wider ) have been mixed . 
  so blaming the eu for `` taking away our rightful clay !! '', 
  is jumping the gun at this time . 
  as for rightful clay , the point of that whole argument and arbitration is that there 's no `` rightful '' for either side , juga did n't settle the borders properly and so here we are , arguing . 
   leave austro-ugarska  join jugoslavija  leave jugoslavija  join eu  mumble about `` muh sovereignty '' all that time, 
  that dispute is as old as independent croatia and slovenia are . 
  and we both initially agreed to the arbitration because we 're too petty to settle it on our own . 
  and it remains to be seen what will happen in the end . 
  so - just do n't . 
  \\ + she has croatian ancestry ( ? ) . 
  such multi-kulti , many tolerance , much wow . 
  i have plenty of bad things to say about vu\u010di\u0107 ( mind you most of it is 2nd hand from serbian redditors ) , but i sometimes wish my politicians were as good at pr . 
  what eurovisionist said , people expected yes would win . 
  plus , our voter turnout is generally lame for everything , people are passive/lazy/disillusioned with politics in general , `` what 's the point of voting when x/y will win anyways '' . 
  mind you , imo there is the problem of eu being pretty bad at explaining what it is and what it does . 
  you have plenty of wrong for-and-against arguments flying around , and then also the * lack of arguments * as well . 
  i learned more about the eu in a few months of browsing this sub than in the 3 + years of living in it ... and redditors are a small % of the population . 
  what you say about us being kinda-integrated already : in which way do you mean that ? 
  asking cause the only other balkan country i visited properly is greece , and i do n't think they count for this argument . 
  google translate did well in this case \\ ^ ^, 
  as others said , our tourism was rising ( well , first going back to the 80 's levels ) anyways . 
  and unfortunately many of our youth use it to screw off to ireland or germany , which to be fair - emigration has been a thing here for more than a century ... but making it easier does n't really help . 
  people use the `` path of least resistance '' , so even if they 're doctors who can live perfectly decently here , they rather go to germoney and earn 2x . 
  as for visible improvements ... depends . 
  my city , plenty of firms do n't know how to use the eu funds cause they 're incompetent like that . 
  then some others do , for example we 'll be getting a new river port , modernized and extended tram lines , sprucing up the old town , then the water supply firm started draining even the access funds . 
  so i guess , eu is what you make of it . 
  our lazy and incompetent who still live in the commie times mentally - expecting that `` the state '' will take care of you - well they get nothing . 
  my hope is that the negative effects like the increased brain drain will actually force the state and the employers to become less awful . 
  lately some of the employers have had trouble finding or keeping their workers , which means not just less money for them , but also less taxes gathered , which altogether means less profit for our white-collar robbers be they politicians or not . 
  so i hope they 'll just be forced to `` get a grip '' . 
  and when croats came here in 7th century , they thought `` well , even if this clay does n't have many internal resources to boast of , at least it 'll make for pretty paintings '' . 
  and that 's why it 's easy to karma-farm today . 
  just go to / r/earthporn and submit [ `` plitvice '' .

  ( and then there 's norway . 
  they have both pic karma and oil . 
  so unfair ! ), 
  and then we wonder why romania beat us in ppp lately  . <, 
  pozdrav !, 
  hmmm , would you say this one is properly spicy , as an `` impartial '' balkan observer ? 
  i feel that it comes off kinda like [ this ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ozjp2oq.gif ) :1, 
  hope something like that happens , yep . 
  but first we 'll need a bit of time for the dust to settle , like give it a few months . 
  your lot can claim that you 're working on implementing the arbitration as it is , our lot can claim we 're working on making a new deal ( iirc our parliament ruling basically obliges us in that sense ) . 
  do some minor irrelevant tweaks ^ ^ 1 if needed so that the text does n't look like a copypasta . 
  both sides claim awesome diplomatic victory and we move on . 
  1 : can we `` give back '' jo\u0161ko joras pls ? 
  it 's madam  and no but seriously , it 's so lame . 
  something like [ this . 
  ] ( http://i.imgur.com/ozjp2oq.gif ) [ google translate ca n't quite handle this hilarity , but try anyways ~ ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/6ite9n/nije_vic_ako_slovenija_u_zaljev_uputi_ratni_brod/dj8wu51/ ), 
  bosnia had n't had a coast in ... uhhh , almost never . 
  there was some short-lived bosnian kingdom in the middle ages that had southern dalmatia . 
  we owe them the coast in no way whatsoever . 
  in fact if we 'll go by `` who squeezed who '' out of territory , we can easily say that ottomans squeezed * us * out of our old bosnian clay . 
  ( and quite a lot of it . ), 
  the sea border with slovenia is disputed because it was never properly settled in the first place . 
  and as for slovenia having a tiny - unfair - coast in general , first you should [ blame italy . 
  ] ( http://www.slovenia-activity-holidays.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/political-map-of-slovenia.gif ) as for `` being nice '' , what kind of an argument is that ? 
  can you just imagine russia giving free gas because `` they have more than enough '' , germany giving free vw 's because `` they have more than enough '' , so on and so forth ? 
  in fact , since i mentioned italy already , why do n't they just give trieste to slovenia , they have more than enough coast and that 'd be nice , would n't it ? 
  \\* do n't listen to these two idiots . 
  no , there wo n't be . 
  if anything like that happened , more than half of croatia would stampede to the eu while they still had the chance before we pulled out completely . 
  what would be left is the bellends , the `` too old to run '' and so on . 
  not that it will possibly ever happen , such a referendum - not a single current or potential ruling elite would let us vote on it . 
  * they know where the money and the safety is . 
  * or are you buying into those ridiculous `` sovereignty '' fables ? 
  take a good long look at our history and * guess * why we 've been in some version of eu since ** 1102 ** , barring the brief war + reconstruction interruption between 90 's and 2013 . 
  meh , official naming of regions in yurop goes by compass , most often they put us in `` south-east '' . 
  outside of that , you get distinctions like baltic/balkan/iberian peninsula etc. 
  we 're around 2/3 or 1/2 in balkan geographically , depending on who you ask , and it 's not like we 're trying to state otherwise . 
  and balkan itself has so many negative ( imo propaganda , but that 's a different rant ) connotations that obviously nobody likes to be associated with it , up to and including greece who 's as balkan as it gets ( they literally ca n't escape anywhere else ) . 
  but it 's not like we get omg triggered when all sorts of geographers/politicians etc refer to us as balkan , not comparable to slovenian triggering . 
  ours is saved for `` are n't you just serbs '' , `` are n't you yugos all the same '' , `` were n't you soviet '' and so on  . <, 
  why are you spewing bullshit everywhere ? 
  if you knew anything at all about us in either present or history , you 'd know that we 've put up with waaay worse than this without war . 
  i 'm starting to doubt you 're even from croatia . 
  go pick a fight with some internet \u010cetnik if you 're that bored , this tough guy talk against janezi is just cringey . 
  ca n't you see from the username alone that he 's a troll ? 
  wait your turn for when it comes to resolving the bosnian border !, 
  it remains to be seen 2 . 
  we 're not even pretending to be serbia 's friend , have n't been for ... a very long time now , been tense with them almost as long as we 've been friendly/allied with you ( well , used to be , apparently we 're not friendly and allied anymore ) 3 . 
  we do n't tell everyone and their grandmother about how not-balkan we are . 
  tbh this last bit feels the most cringey to me ~, 
  do n't be so mean , they 're still salty about trianon . 
  wait , squabble in balkans or the rest of yurop ? 
  or both ? 
  ( tbh i find this refreshing after all the `` breakfast is breakfast '' , `` are v4 great defenders of sovereignty or backwards catholibans '' , `` who was insulted by dank vlad/erdogoon/president twitterbot today '' , `` moooslims are coming hide yo wife hide yo children '' and so on . ), 
  bah , it 's stupid trolling/joking ( knowing that redditor ) . 
  [ such absurd `` what if '' jokes have been rampart lately . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/croatia/comments/6ite9n/nije_vic_ako_slovenija_u_zaljev_uputi_ratni_brod/dj8wu51/ ) though perhaps he should have indicated sarcasm more clearly , yeah i agree that the comment looks ... hillbilly at best . 
  no , you 're bringing up gotovina for the purpose of trolling/character attack , he has literally nothing to do with this thread or argument . 
  i have low patience for such * balkan * behavior . 
  does that count ? 
  avoid weekends , especially weekends in summer . 
  ( selfie-sticks seem to be multiplying ! ), 
  actually , here 's [ general tips . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6c9do9/plitvice_lakes_croatia/dhszw2u/ ) also while you 're between here and there , see if you have a couple of days for zagreb and zagorje , imho zagorje is prettier than the coast ( though that 's just my taste probably ) .
