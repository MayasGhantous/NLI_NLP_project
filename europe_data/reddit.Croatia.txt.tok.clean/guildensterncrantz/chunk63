  museum of broken relationships is apparently awesome , i do n't even know why i have n't visited yet , been to zg a dozen times at least ... / headdesk . 
  and can recommend climbing up to medvedgrad , good view . 
  maybe merkel is salty about the immigrant clusterfuck ? 
  iirc she wanted us to `` keep them '' somehow . 
  [ except that fellow did really threaten to send a warship and `` buy some more '' in the bay . 
  ] ( https://www.vecernji.hr/premium/arbitraza-slovenija-hrvatska-dimitrije-rupel-1177959 ) so that bit of idiocy does come from someone official on your side , while ours boils down to redditors shitposting , afaik . 
  and stay the hell away from gotovina and the war , you got off very lightly and you do n't get to play `` being the general after the battle '' . 
  oh look , you border a * single * ex-yugo and you could n't resolve it in 25 years . 
  it got so bad you were caught compromising the neutral court , and now you 'll be relying on outsider 's arm-twisting to resolve it . 
  teach me your progressive ways , civilized senpai !, 
  yeah , in the end i think we can all agree that this whole fight is stupid and damaging . 
  i mean i 'd be fine with these borders if they were amicably settled in 2000 's , not like me or the vast majority of people here care about some small patches of land/sea . 
  it should n't have become a matter of `` principle '' ... could have been resolved at least two times in earlier 2000 's , but that did n't happen because * i do n't even know * . 
  political posturing from both sides is my best guess . 
  and [ kosor and pahor ] ( http://lifestyle.enaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/borut_pahor_jadranka_kosor_50713.jpg ) looked so promising . 
  \\* sigh * you 're still gon na come to coast , right ? 
  and we 'll buy gorenje . 
  except you 're off-point . 
  yugoslavia did n't care to settle the internal borders properly , because why would it , when we were all `` yugoslavs '' , brotherhood and unity and all that . 
  this is why we have disputes with ex-yugos but not with hungary for example . 
  yes , it 'd be good if we became less dependent on tourists . 
  except that atm they 're around 20 % of our gdp and it seems that there 's no plan for replacing it with something else , certainly not from any of our governments that `` care a lot '' about us plebs . 
  so you may as well go like `` if croatia was germany , this would n't have happened '' for all that it 's relevant to the argument . 
  we ca n't afford to lose the tourists , and we certainly ca n't afford to lose the huge amount of trade with slovenia . 
  except we can afford sanctions way less than they can . 
  and too many go though slovenia as it is . 
  as can be seen from the epic lines this easter . 
  tourists are finicky , taking the longer way around though hungary , well they just might decide to go elsewhere . 
  we do n't have the upper hand here , that 's the point . 
  you know , it 'd be top trolling if vu\u010di\u0107 and kolinda and all that lot decided to settle our borders in like - 5 minutes . 
  say , make danube the border because that 's just sensible , but then tally the numbers , see how much territory croatia loses like that , do an exchange somewhere in the south to make it fair . 
  vu\u010di\u0107 would look downright * progressive * compared to janezi . 
  can you imagine the press ? 
  hdz and sdp and most and everyone will fold like a wet tissue if or when slovenia creates another 5-hour-long queue on the border . 
  well , look at it this way . 
  aside from economic issues , all those chapters to be resolved and so on - so , standard eu ascension stuff everyone goes through - the two biggest obstacles for us joining was handing over the generals ... and slovenia . 
  i do n't think i have to explain how del ponte and her rants against us were personally perceived ( `` you 're hiding gotovina !! '' ... 
  and he eventually gets found on * canary islands * ) . 
  but that did n't feel like some kind of shock , we learned to keep our expectations low when it comes to the international community , random stranger-countries etc. 
  slovenia 's blocking did come as a nasty shock to me . 
  we were friends/allies for more than a hundred years before ... for heaven 's sake , croatia 's been supporting montenegro in its nato/eu ascension , and we have way less historical or present reason for it than you supporting us . 
  it seems that i was wrong about the friend bit . 
  and the ally bit , that 's just stupid . 
  most of the world does n't even know we exist , not like we have allies to spare . 
  yes , but when we 're at slovenian troubles with sea access , slovenian troubles with small coast , it 's [ perfectly clear ] ( http://www.maps-of-europe.net/maps/maps-of-slovenia/detailed-physical-map-of-slovenia-with-all-roads-cities-and-airports.jpg ) who the clay-stealing thief is - if there is any . 
  and yet `` we 're the thieves '' . 
  they 're too big to argue with , obviously . 
  oh , hold your horses . 
  we 'll be forced to accept it , if not visibly , then in `` backroom arm-twisting '' . 
  this ruling is eu 's baby , they 'll push it if for nothing else , then `` reputation '' . 
  and the fact that nobody really gives a shit about either slovenia or croatia , so they could n't care less about our disputes and who 's right/not right , so long as the issue is `` solved '' somehow . 
  1/4 of your gulf ? 
  are you trolling or you just never looked at that map ? 
  i can already see it . 
  people hang around on croatian coast ... enter `` slovenian '' sea . 
  border checkpoint at the edge of water !, 
  it ca n't , that 's the point , and they 're not even trying because they know it . 
  getting access to international waters is n't guaranteed anywhere . 
  except we lost the arbitration in the ina-mol case with hungary , and ina is probably a dozen times more relevant for our interests than the bay of piran . 
  and the government accepted that decision without a whine . 
  oh yeah , we 're balkan savages here . 
  that 's why we 've been caught compromising the supposedly neutral court . 
  but after 2015 , as our government left the proceedings for obvious reasons , they offered - and kept offering - that this gets solved bilaterally . 
  all i heard from your side is `` no i do n't care , arbitration continues '' . 
  so apparently you `` do n't trust '' in it getting solved bilaterally . 
  ( or you do n't care . ), 
  we do n't trust in that court * because it 's been compromised * . 
  the thinking goes `` fool me once , fool me twice '' , if it 's been compromised in your favor once , who 's to say it wo n't be again ? 
  and this is after you 've been trying to strong-arm us on the issue for more than a decade , starting with the eu-blocking - that is the perception of the issue here ... eu ascension is about a dozen times more relevant for any country than some bathtub worth of water . 
  and you got there first , so you used that fine opportunity to `` bully us '' , because fuck good relations between first neighbors and old allies . 
  yah , i think usa only rarely remembers we even exist , so i really do n't see them caring ... unless they randomly spy on everything ( i think they do ) and then they just ... hand out cookies sometimes , depending on how they feel that week . 
  first time i 'm hearing about this . 
  mwahahaah the karma is mine in this case senpai !, 
  ( you have more than enough already . ), 
   brushing it all to luck would be a crime . 
   lots have to do with culture . 
  first , i said that * most * is up to luck . 
  you can try to be as `` culturally advanced '' as you please , it does n't help if geography , climate , violent neighbors etc etc are n't cooperating . 
  like for example the ussr choking eastern europe , do you think france would fare better if you switched it with poland geographically ? 
  and yet there are still stereotypes about `` lazy '' eastern euros , after all they `` must '' be lazy or incompetent because they 're poorer , right ? 
  ( that kind of thinking is usually present among the rich , they think that if they could make it , everyone can make it , and if they had n't , it must be a failure of character . 
  good single-country example is usa and its belief that they 're a nation of `` temporarily embarrassed millionaires '' . ), 
  my * point * about the historical examples of southern euros outshining the northern is that such circumstances can and do change . 
  if a single nation like czechia can go from rich to poor to rich again in a little over a century , then - where is this `` inherent '' worth - or lack of worth , of character , of culture which is the nation 's character ? 
  corruption , unemployment , wealth , all of that can and does change over time . 
  west and north is richer and more orderly now . 
  does n't mean this is set in stone . 
  really ? 
  would those same south euro countries be the ones that colonized so much of the world , invented the western civilization , and then re-invented it during the renaissance ? 
  and all this during times many of the north euros were poor af/illiterate barbarians ? 
  please do n't be that fool that thinks there 's much to the argument about `` inherent '' differences . 
  empires come and go , good times come and go , sometimes you 're the byzantine empire that outlasts the western rome by a 1000 years , sometimes you get annexed by ottomans . 
  yes , but sometimes people get drunk or mad or temporarily insane , and in those cases it 's better if they do n't have easy access to such deadly weapons . 
  you can kill people more easily with a gun than with a knife . 
  mind you , i suppose it makes more sense for finland ... your population is pretty spread out over a large area , no ? 
  just the wild animals could become a problem , and that 's disregarding your unfriendly neighbor . 
  i did n't even know this stereotype about romanian = roma before i came to this sub . 
  the most i heard `` on the street '' was that you have a lot of them ... but no nonsense about them being romanians or coming from there . 
  i mean ... they 're a nomad culture that came from india ( iirc ) . 
  and anybody who knows anything about them will be aware that * citizenship * to them means little .
