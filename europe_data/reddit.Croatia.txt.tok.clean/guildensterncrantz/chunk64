  they have their own thing , their culture/ethnicity/whatever , and they keep it wherever they go . 
  it 's kinda like , idk - maybe like jews , * but even more * , because jews stand out waaaay less/integrate more . 
  though i suppose it helps that in my language it 's rumunji vs romi ( and the non-pc version is `` cigani '' anyways ) . 
   im nationalistic after all i am a patriot two different things . 
  patriot loves his country , but also acknowledges its faults , and respects - or is at least neutral to - other countries . 
  nationalist `` loves '' his country so much that he acknowledges no faults in it , and he often disrespects other countries . 
  it 's the difference between loving your country and thinking it 's `` the best '' and everything wrong is `` always the fault of these others '' . 
  ( sound familiar ? ), 
  then there 's the 3rd group , idk what they 're called . 
  it 's the people who hate their country/people ... possibly in the mistaken - edgy - belief that `` they 're * special * , not like the rest of these fools here '' . 
  imo they 're dumber than even the nationalists , while those throw shit at others , the haters throw it - on themselves . 
   is the danube really against you ? 
  yep . 
  [ see here . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatia%e2%80%93serbia_border_dispute#/media/file:croatia_serbia_border_backa_baranja.svg ) serbia claims that danube is the border , croatia claims that old border is the border . 
  danube is obviously on the side of serbia !, 
  ( god is a serb ?? ), 
  but seriously now , yeah i also think that what you propose is best . 
  keeping the old border is senseless , you 'd have these small-ish pockets of land on the other side , just building enough bridges would be a nightmare . 
  so , we could `` trade '' somewhere in the south , [ after danube diverts east .

  hmm ... unless i 'm mistaken , your recent posting history suggests you 're an alt-righter . 
  so no , you wo n't fare very well on r/croatia . 
  and to be honest , i think that 's a good thing . 
  whyyy, 
  you 're overestimating the importance of piran itself for us . 
  if there 's any coastal problem we have , then it 's neum . 
  it 's not about the bay on its own , as long as the verdict is n't something preposterous like `` people go from croatian coast ... into slovenian sea . 
  border checkpoint at the edge of water !! '', 
  it 's about the perception of the dispute . 
  we feel that you 've been trying to extort us for more than a decade . 
  first with the eu-blocking ( now that felt personal and ugly ) , after which we both agreed to take it to impartial judges , and then the same `` impartial '' judges were compromised from your side . 
  if that 's not an example of arm-twisting * just because you can * , then i do n't know what is . 
  yes , everyone and their grandmother knows you 're `` superior '' to us . 
  economic indicators , quality of life , all that . 
  however , personally i ca n't stand superiority complexes that go like `` we 're * more capable people * than you are '' . 
  slovenia was closer to vienna than croatia , of course vienna invested more in its development . 
  it was n't the military frontier against ottomans for centuries on end , of course its loses were n't as bad historically . 
  it could leave yugoslavia basically-peacefully , because guess again , it did n't have `` oppressed minorities '' to be rescued , and having croatia as a meat-shield helped again . 
  in general , i 'm not buying in most such superiority complexes . 
  some nations were luckier than others because of geography or climate or even native fauna ( look at the americas , no horses and no pigs , can you even imagine the `` fine european civilization '' without those ? 
  ) , some nations were better at * stealing * other nations ' stuff . 
  so while i think there is something in being more hard-working and such , i 'd say that luck is most of it . 
  aaaaaaaaaaaaa i thought it was just a serbian cunning plot !, 
  but i did n't know you were in on it too !, 
  in retrospect , i * should have known * , is n't serbia your 2nd best neighbor ( after the black sea ) ? 
  in any case , i 'm onto you now !, 
  i expect that our government will likely have some demands from serbia before they enter the eu , yes . 
  though most of what i heard so far is the issues with croatian minorities in vojvodina , not the border which honestly goes ignored in day-to-day life and politics . 
  ( hence you get hilarious memetic events like that crazy czech establishing `` liberland '' in no man 's land . ), 
  in any case . 
  this whole border dispute makes me cringe ( whenever i remember it , it 's not much of a thing here ) . 
  slovenia and croatia were allies in most issues for the past 100 + years , just look at the developments in yugoslavia ( and even before that , in a-h ) where you usually had `` slovenia and croatia think x '' , like some pat & mat . 
  and instead of solving this peacefully and being each other 's allies within eu and nato and so on , we 're doing the equivalent of pulling each other 's hair . 
  and it 's not like we have many other allies to spare , most of the world barely remembers we even exist . 
  it 's sad and it 's stupid . 
  which is the other reason this dispute over a. . . bathtub worth of sea ... exists . 
  danube is the border with serbia , because it makes sense to have natural barriers as borders ? 
  but it keeps shifting in a way that means we 're losing territory because it 's a bloody river that could n't care less about `` territory '' ? 
  yeah i can already see it , `` xaxaxaxa but you lost the same dispute with slovenia , gib clay !! '', 
  in any case , i predict more political idiocy , regardless of the verdict . 
  our government 's position is that this arbitration stopped existing , we did everything relevant to withdraw from it , and so the verdict does n't matter , regardless of who it favors , and the issue should be settled bilaterally . 
  slovenia thinks 100 % the opposite of that . 
  it 's like two children yelling `` la la la i ca n't hear you ! '', 
  hmmm . 
  politburo took potato ? 
  err ... but then the irish do n't fit . 
  can the uk count as a politburo ? 
  and til !, 
  it 's like , why have n't i heard of this * amazing * achievement before ? 
  i feel like the internet has failed me ( . _ . ), 
  so apparently the municipality of belica in me\u0111imurje takes its [ potato farming very seriously . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/belica,_me%c4%91imurje_county ) now i 'm kinda salty . 
  i 'd like a corn monument for myself , thank you very much !, 
  in theory . 
  in practice  the jna had disarmed the territorial units of slovenia and croatia prior to the declaration of independence , at the behest of serbian president slobodan milo\u0161evi\u0107 . 
  mm , we feel we `` kinda get '' ireland because they had the long-standing issues with brits , plus emigration , plus general poverty , the issue of northern ireland ( kinda like parts of bosnia for us ) etc etc. 
  ( and the appreciation of the pub ! ), 
  they turned the whole poverty thing around in recent decades , which actually gives me faint hope . 
  but in regards to your larger point ~ yes , i tend to agree that the `` omg big differences '' are overblown . 
  we 're all human and far more similar than different . 
  but , what are we supposed to do , create some superstate that covers the whole world ? 
  bad idea , if for nothing else , then logistics . 
  big countries/empires tend to neglect the periphery , and then it gets harder to keep some sort of cohesion as the population + physical distance grows . 
  and i do n't know why there should be need for it when loose unions like the eu work well enough in terms of sharing resources and keeping the ( internal ) peace . 
  and so today we get modern nations that were built from common history and common institutions . 
  they 're not perfect of course , but imo it 's better than proposed alternatives ... we 're social creatures . 
  we like our `` groups '' . 
  giving credit to usa for the breakup of yugoslavia is like giving credit to putin for all the populist uprisings in the world . 
  it 's 98 % nonsense . 
  ex-yugos are all grown up and they do n't - and did n't - need `` big bad usa '' to make them hate each other . 
  the decay of yugoslavia started as soon as that country was made after wwi , `` it was all good as long as tito was alive '' is a [ simplistic myth . 
  ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/croatian_spring ) the issues that country faced were eerily similar to the issues eu faces today ... with the difference that the eu is n't a communist dictatorship that 's experiencing a 2,700 % inflation rate . 
  here 's a counter question : what does actually separate me from poles ? 
  czech ? 
  or even further , the irish for example ? 
  i listen to their stories and it sounds so samey-same .
