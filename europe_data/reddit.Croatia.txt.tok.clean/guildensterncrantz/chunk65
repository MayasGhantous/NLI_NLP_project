  prague felt like home . 
  ok , here 's a specific example . 
  i just read [ this article . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6jz1j1/europes_backyard_tensions_rising_in_balkans_as/ ) it only sounds `` familiar '' to me because those are close-ish neighbors and so i 've kinda learned how they think though exposure . 
  but feeling any kind of closeness to russia , turkey , the rest of the middle east , it sounds ridiculous to me . 
  `` russians/greeks are our brothers '' - my reaction is `` what , why ? '', 
  and turks are even further away , i 'd say that all of significance they left here is the good food like burek . 
  then take how vu\u010di\u0107 became president recently . 
  `` no tv debates ? 
  media is all for him ? '', 
  again , as unhappy as i am with my politicians , that sounds preposterous . 
  macedonia clinging to alexander may as well be something from a different continent as `` close '' as it feels to me . 
  bosnia ... * belgium * would probably understand that how that country ( not ) functions best . 
  and on and on it goes . 
  or if you do n't `` believe me '' and my impressions ( i do n't know why , all sorts of nations in the world look samey-same to me but i do n't go claiming that they actually are because i suspect my opinion is * ignorance * ) , here 's a [ raw numbers example . 
  ] ( http://suffragio.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/balkans-gdp.png ), 
  the un peacekeeping missions did ... nothing ( at least in croatia and bosnia ) . 
  un in general did nothing , or worse , what with the weapon 's embargo that made things worse because only one side was properly armed in the beginning , so the other two had to smuggle and/or raid jna barracks . 
  nato got involved by the end in bosnia , and then of course in the late 90 's in regards to kosovo . 
  how effective that was is debatable , that is , it 's debatable how `` righteous '' that mission was . 
  but the un , i think yugoslavia is a perfect poster example of `` why one needs to count on un being useless or worse than useless '' . 
  that 's a common opinion among outsiders . 
  the fact of the matter is that all western balkans really have in common - more than they have with the rest of slavs , or greeks , or italians/etc - is geographic proximity and language . 
  ( and not even all of them , slovenes and macedonians are unintelligible . 
  plus between those two you have the dialect continuum , standardized language is one thing , me understanding the kajkavian speakers another . ), 
  the tl ; dr is that croatia , serbia , slovenia had more than a thousand years of separate history , bosnia centuries , certainly longer than literally every anglosphere ex-colony , and yet people do n't ask usa `` well why do n't you unite again , are n't you just brits in denial ? '', 
  i mean , to go back far enough in history when we were one people ... you 'd probably have to go to the migration period when * all slavs * were one people . 
  so before the 20th century , we had next to nothing to do with each other . 
  in croatia 's case , hungary , austria and italy had 10x more influence than for example serbia . 
  after the disintegration of a-h and the ottoman empire , yugoslavia was made for political reasons , like a mini-eu : `` there 's safety in numbers '' . 
  it failed pretty badly ... and that 's that . 
  `` centuries of fuckups '' is my best guess . 
  it used to be part of croatia/serbia , then they made an independent kingdom ... shortly before ottomans invaded . 
  not a good time to be independent . 
  next followed a few centuries of being under ottomans , plenty of population converting to islam . 
  then a-h finally annexed it in late 19th century , but by then neither a-h nor the bosnian muslims were interested in splitting the whole thing between croatia/serbia . 
  yugoslavia followed that policy . 
  so by the 90 's you had a country where half of the population was `` minorities '' ( croats and serbs ) , and also all 3 groups were mixed up everywhere , it 's not like you had clean ethnic lines to draw . 
  so the whole thing was kept together because ... nobody really knows what to do with bosnia . 
  at least , nobody knows from acceptable moral standpoint . 
  [ + the 5th largest lignite reserves in the world :3 ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/kosovo-lignite.jpg ), 
  i 'll be damned , looks like you 're right . 
  you know with his ranting against nato/globalism/capitalism ( ? 
  ) / the `` west '' , he 'd fit right in with the yugonostalgics here . 
  no , your argument is still off-topic and `` whataboutism '' . 
  the bloody point of this article is justice being served for srebrenica . 
  and the dutch were there under the un mandate , nato only got involved later ... and `` as it happens '' , against the side that committed srebrenica . 
  that - and the markale massacres of civilians in sarajevo - was their key motivation/explanation for getting involved , in fact . 
  your `` but what about nato being bad '' is so stretched in this case that - it does n't make sense . 
  keep your crusade for some middle east thread , will you ? 
  ... what does that have to do with srebrenica ? 
  well russia and serbia see nato as an enemy/are salty at it . 
  belarus tends to either think what russia thinks , or they just ... do their own thing . 
  moldova leans towards russia , no ? 
  irish are neutral because it appears their only natural enemy is the brits , and that stopped getting heated a while back . 
  finland and sweden ... afraid of what russia would do if they tried ? 
  or they do n't trust such organizations , at least i 've seen some finns say so . 
  ( bad history with relying on others , i think ? ), 
  also about sweden , well russia would first need to go though finland ... 
  i 'm sorry , but i have to !, 
  `` if russia attacked sweden , sweden would fight to the last finn '' . 
  bosnia always has several separate opinions on stuff . 
  switzerland and austria are `` always neutral '' ... because switzerland keeps all our money safe , austria does n't have that , but then again they 're very far away from potential battlefields . 
  slovakia , bulgaria , greece and turkey are in nato ... idk why their support is lower . 
  except maybe greece and turkey because - they 're each other 's first `` enemies '' , nato does n't help there . 
  & nbsp ; but based on my `` expert '' analysis , maybe it 's not so much about being in/out of an organization , but more the other part you said - having need for it , and then not liking to help people who need it more . 
  `` we 're neutral '' , they say . 
  i usually translate it as `` yeah we know we 're not the first in the line of fire , too bad about those that are '' . 
  i do n't even know why i keep talking to you . 
  i know you 're provoking me . 
  it 's the small chance that someone else reads this slapfight , i guess . 
   so croatia did exist as a sovereign nation after 1100 ? 
  it existed within a * personal union * with hungary and later austria . 
  your first argument was that we were `` under a-h '' and therefore we could also be `` under you '' , as in conquered by army . 
  let me put it into simplest words possible . 
  union is * willing * . 
  annexation is not . 
  union is what happened with us and a-h , us and yugoslavia , us and eu . 
  we were/are fine with it the vast majority of time , meaning we 're cooperating . 
  annexation is what the ottomans did to you , and what ottomans and venice and ultimately serbia tried to do with us , with varying degrees of success . 
  we were n't fine with that , and i assume you also were n't fine being under ottomans . 
  actually , going by * your * logic , hmm it seems that since you were unwillingly under ottomans for centuries , it seems that * you * would be easier to keep cowed after conquering , no ? 
   it was us who beat ottomans and austrians into submission ( balkan wars / ww1 ) . 
  are you aware that we `` removed kebab '' centuries before you did ? 
  in fact , they could never properly take us for any relevant periods of time . 
  also , i seem to recall that several other countries participated in this final war against ottomans . 
  austrians , ahahaha that 's a good one . 
  the entente beat the central powers - for the most part . 
   nato literally won that war . 
  if it were n't for our idiotic leadership , croatia would have had republika srpsksa of its own . 
  what the hell does nato have to do with operation storm ? 
  besides usa training our folks and allegedly sharing intelligence ? 
  it seems that you 've learned alternative history in regards to the recent past as well . 
  but do keep telling yourself that you lost that war because of `` mighty nato '' , whatever makes you feel better . 
  i 'm done with you . 
  i could almost swear on my left kidney that you added  also , croatia was under austrian/hungarian rule for almost a millennia . 
  i would say they were far from failures in that respect . 
  so that 's why i commented much later . 
  i did n't have much to add to `` he was an idealist and a megalomaniac '' . 
  i usually do have something to add when ... a certain type of neighbor ... revises my country 's history , contrary to all relevant historians .
