  and as for your * fantasies * of partitioning us , you tried in the 90 's when you were much stronger , and it did n't work then either . 
  it was even less likely to work after wwi :  the total number of casualties is placed around 1,000,000 : 25 % of serbia 's prewar size , and an absolute majority ( 57 % ) of its overall male population . 
  see ? 
  your `` megalomaniac '' king probably saved another double-digit percentage of your male population . 
  he was smart , this one time . 
  ah , you edited again . 
   also , croatia was under austrian/hungarian rule for almost a millennia . 
  has it escaped your notice that this was a willing unification ? 
  personal union with hungary after our last king died ( there was a got-style clusterfuck in regards to `` well , now what ?? '', 
  and the hungarian fellow had some claim through marriage , so ... ) , then after the battle of moh\u00e1cs , same shit - the hungarian throne was empty , we choose ferdinand i. 
  ( and yes , i do use `` choose '' , bunch of nobles convene somewhere and decide . ), 
  and this lasted for 800 years . 
  compare that to the violent annexation attempts by venice and ottomans . 
  more battles and rebellions than i can count , while the relationship with incarnations of a-h was ... well mostly nothing `` interesting '' ever happened . 
  mind you , * you * may have learned an edited version of that history , i suppose . 
  you 're spying within the enemy ranks , i presume ? 
  we are `` working '' and `` studying '' very hard , of course . 
  from what i can tell/guess , greeks and greek cypriots are sort of like us and bosnian croats . 
  not the same country , living in different surroundings , but for various reasons - like twins . 
  like , if closeness between people goes : 10 for same country and ethnicity , 1 for totally unrelated ( like us and china for example ) , 7 for first neighbors with fairly close historical ties , then then these two cases would be 8 or 9 . 
  oh , unless he was brainless , i 'd say that he knew what his violent attempts at centralization would do , it 's not like slovenians and us were somehow quiet or unclear in what we expected from yugoslavia , from the very beginning . 
  hint : the opposite of that country being just as unequal/or worse than a-h by the end . 
  hence me saying `` one of the * rare * wise decisions he made '' , that country was poisoned as soon as it began . 
  and as i hinted earlier , all sorts of more powerful empires/republics/etc tried to annex and/or subjugate us and slovenia . 
  they failed . 
  i seriously doubt that serbia - coming from its terrible loses in wwi - would have somehow succeeded . 
  and what does your off-topic character attack have to do with cyprus or what / u/annoyameps said ? 
  if that was the plan * back then * , then your king may have made one of the rare wise decisions in his life when he went with politics instead of conquest . 
  * you are n't the ottomans * , regardless of how much your proposed borders are a copy of their ( brief ) heyday . 
  yeah they 're [ underrepresented on reddit ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6jli6t/european_countries_subreddits_number_of/djf4dlw/ ) , and that means even more because their population is pretty small . 
  plus , because bosnia is complicated , its croats and serbs sometimes/often ( ? ), 
  use croatia/serbia flairs ( i 've seen that so far as often as i saw bih flairs ) . 
  unfortunately , [ no .

  we do have an island in a lake on an island . 
  ( sort of . 
  well , they 're calling them `` lakes '' . ), 
  [ st. mary 's island on mljet ] ( http://www.absolute-croatia.com/dubrovnik-region/mljet-island/attractions/item/st-mary-island ) , is that [ enough ? 
  ] ( https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/06/3c/73/7f/adriatic-explore-day.jpg ) :d, 
  in case you were n't confused enough by slovenia and slovakia , there 's also slavonia/slavonija . 
  [ map of regions in croatia . 
  ] ( http://www.croatiaexclusive.com/portals/0/linkimages/cex-main-maps/map-regions.png ) also , slavonia is perhaps the furthest away from what people think when they say `` croatia '' . 
  those would be the coast + coastal mountains , * maybe * zagreb and [ zagorje ] ( http://www.direct-croatia.com/images/slike_gradovi/krapina.jpg ) if you passed through there on your way to the coast . 
  [ slavonia ] ( http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/66053883.jpg ) ... more than half of it looks like [ this . 
  ] ( http://croatia.hr/images/t900x600-18853/croatia_slavonija_danube_191202.jpg ) because it 's in the panonian basin , looks way more similar to hungary than anything coastal . 
  hmm , well , that ... 
  yes , i kinda counted on it . 
  `` oh look , a-h flag . '', 
  ... `` repost to r/europe ! '', 
  if you need any help , there 's the tourist megathread on r/croatia . 
  ^ ( we are n't shills ... yet/as far as i know , so we wo n't send you to all the most expensive tourist traps :p ), 
  the rest of ex-yu : where you at ? 
  yeah , i thought it was a spelling error in the original article or whatever , because google was determined to tell me `` did you mean abbazia ?? 
  '' , but wiki says ~ [ opatija ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opatija ) : italian : * abbazia * . 
  so wiki is wrong , then ? 
  here 's to hoping i translated correctly . 
  [ recent article here . 
  ] ( http://fluminensia.org/rodendan-stare-dame ) the interesting thing is that the touristic development of opatija / [ kvarner ] ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kvarner_gulf ) started even during a-h times . 
  translated bits from article ~ great credit for the development of north adriatic goes to friedrich julius sch\u00fcler ( 1832-1894 ) , from 1878 the director of the southern railways , the austrian corporation based in vienna , founded in 1859 . 
  sch\u00fcler was responsible for the construction of semerin\u0161ke railways ( * semmeringbahn * ) in austria , which starts at gloggnitz and leads over the semmering to m\u00fcrzzuschlag . 
  friedrich julius sch\u00fcler encouraged the building of * kvarner * ( quarnero ) in 1884. , but also other hotels tied to that railway , like the one in tolbach ( grand hotel toblach ) and semmering ( grand hotel s\u00fcdbahn ) . 
  arrival of emperors and other dignitaries by rail to the station in matulj was followed by worldwide press . 
  for example , * the new york times * informs its readers in the issue of 30 march 1894 , about the austrian emperor franz joseph i and the german emperor wilhelm ii meeting first in matulj in the * royal waiting room * , and then taking the carriage to opatija . 
  austro-hungarian sovereign stayed at the hotel * stephanie * , and the german one in the * villa amalia * with his entourage . 
  and many other dignitaries , thanks to railways , also discovered the charms of kvarner . 
    and as i recall all sorts of euro countries followed usa 's lead in that fool situation . 
   then you 're recalling pretty damn wrong . 
  no french , german , italian , austrian soldiers in iraq . 
  ...  australia : 2,000 invasion , [ ** poland ** ] : 200 invasion -- 2,500 peak , ** spain ** : 1,300 invasion ** united kingdom ** : 46,000 invasion , united states : 150,000 to 250,000 invasion . 
  other members of the coalition were afghanistan , ** albania ** , angola , azerbaijan , ** bulgaria ** , colombia , costa rica , the ** czech republic ** , ** denmark ** , dominican republic , el salvador , eritrea , ** estonia ** , ethiopia , georgia , honduras , ** hungary ** , ** iceland ** , ** italy ** , japan , kuwait , ** latvia ** , ** lithuania ** , ** macedonia ** , marshall islands , micronesia , mongolia , the ** netherlands ** , nicaragua , palau , panama , the philippines , ** portugal ** , ** romania ** , rwanda , singapore , ** slovakia ** , solomon islands , south korea , tonga , ** turkey ** ( note : if we count it as `` european '' ) , uganda , ** ukraine ** , and uzbekistan . 
  then  most peaceful time for western and central europe , ever . 
  if anyone wonders why russians feel that `` the west '' does n't give a toss about them - things like `` millions plunged into poverty , from a level of 1.5 % in the late soviet era to 39 -- 49 % by mid-1993 . '', 
  - this is it . 
  let 's say you 're a russian that thinks russia should turn west . 
  honest opinions such as this one are n't helping , if i were russian , i 'd think twice about counting on support of people who do n't care if i live or die . 
  you forget what happened after the 90 's . 
  putin happened . 
  russians of today support him for many reasons , and among the key ones is the perception that putin did away with that terrible crisis in the 90 's . 
  ( it 's * perception * , what really happened need not apply . ), 
  economic and social hardship does n't bring `` more friendly rulers to the outside world '' if it happens that the outside world is perceived as responsible for the hardship . 
   those countries are neither funding our extremists , nor flooding us with propaganda , nor hacking our parliaments and elections or waging war against our trading partners . 
  look , yes i also think that we ca n't exactly `` do nothing '' , we should help ukraine and other border-states etc. 
  but . 
  as far as memory serves , the anti-sadam narrative was even worse than anti-vlad narrative . 
  he supposedly had wmd 's , remember ? 
  and as i recall all sorts of euro countries followed usa 's lead in that fool situation . 
  as for libya , bloody hell that `` intervention '' was started by eu states . 
  as for funding our extremists , let 's not be hypocrites . 
  saudi arabia is a bigger culprit there , * and yet * they 're our finest buddies ... because they give us oil . 
  propaganda , my opinion is that it exists but blaming russia for western elections is [ like this . 
  ] ( https://i.redd.it/sk4oay72789y.png ) trump , le pen , all that lot would get exactly nowhere if the people of their countries were n't prone to voting for them anyways . 
  rather than blaming `` hillary 's emails '' , i think anti-trump americans need to ask themselves why the rust belt felt ignored by hillary & co , why the rust belt lost its industry , why usa 's media is distrusted by usa citizens , why same citizens `` do n't trust those experts '' etc. 
  same for le pen and immigrant issues . 
  that was n't created by russia . 
  if you 'll blame anyone for le pen getting into 2nd round , blame those that fund jihadists . 
   i 'll take an instable russia over putins russia every day . 
  remember the 90 's in russia ? 
  it can get worse than that . 
  and if it does , we 'll possibly have yet another migrant crisis , but this time not over the sea or easily guarded chokepoints like asia 's land border with europe . 
  yes but it 's an useless argument .
