  russia wo n't stop , for many reasons . 
  and we ca n't make them stop . 
  let 's say - for the sake of the argument - that we somehow ninja our way into deposing putin . 
  ( he `` falls '' down some stairs , cause that man is n't going peacefully or semi-peacefully , like though protests we fund/support . ), 
  who rules russia after that ? 
  someone that 's just like putin ? 
  or some ineffective fool like yeltsin ? 
  with first , we gained nothing ( and that 's assuming that the successor is n't even worse ) . 
  with second , i honestly doubt russia would stay `` stable enough '' . 
  way too many problems that are mostly pushed under the carpet by putin 's dictatorship , too many minorities and/or potential break-away states , economy too vulnerable to much instability . 
  russia getting someone like merkel ... that ship has sailed for the foreseeable future imo . 
  we like to think that `` the people '' will choose a decent candidate given the opportunity , but as much as putin 's elections are a sham , he * does * have a disturbing share of support among the population . 
  that 's because many russians support * the way he rules * . 
  get someone that 's just as bad ... or get an even more unstable russia . 
  for exhibits , see : libya , iraq . 
  yeah but romania being grouped with v4 is n't romania 's fault . 
  in fact , all of `` eastern europe '' being grouped with v4 is n't ee 's problem , and i see it happen all the time . 
  there are almost daily articles that go along the lines of `` ee making problems '' ... and the actual problem-makers tend to be hungary and poland more often than not . 
  even the v4 is n't some monolithic mass !, 
  it 'd be as preposterous as ee deciding that we - in this case , * everything * west of the old berlin wall - ca n't be trusted because `` after all they 'll quit the project despite all the reasons not to '' ... because uk did that . 
  so , when we 're talking about stereotypes , can we use this example to conclude that west euros really suck at geography ... and paying attention to what each country is actually doing ? 
  fwiw most people could n't care less . 
  except that bit when you blocked our ascension to eu for it , i 'm still kinda salty about that , not cool !, 
  also i sometimes fancy i can feel an air of smugness coming down from triglav . 
  but anyways !, 
  aside from that , we 're cool . 
  we go skiing in your mountains , you come to our coast ( and what 's up with slovenian women being more likely to go topless ? 
  ) , i recently bought a gorenje microwave , etc etc.

  whoever uses `` sheeple '' unironically is showing signs of dubious iq . 
  yep imo it 's much better than \u0110erdap ~, 
  gib iron gates \u3064 \u25d5 _ \u25d5 \u3064, 
  meh , my course - well it 's not entirely useless , i did learn a lot of foundation-stuff in that program . 
  but that 's the problem , `` a bit of this a bit of that '' and you 're not ready for any specific job . 
  i have the foundations for c , c++ , sql , html , css , javascript , php , even bloody assembler of all things , same for working with networks and servers in general and so on . 
  but this is all level 2 out of , idk , 7 . 
  meanwhile we wasted half of our time on retarded bullshit like solving fourier signal transform * on paper * , presumably because our dinosaurs have n't gotten the memo that matlab was invented decades ago precisely so that people do n't need to solve fourier transform on paper !, 
  and our wonderful employers , well most of them do n't have the patience to teach you/mentor you while you learn more . 
  nooooo , they 're looking for masters ... same masters who move ireland because they get 4x the paycheck for the same job . 
  \\* shakes angry fist * mind you , i 'd probably have it way easier if i moved to zagreb . 
  but anyways . 
  how are your exams going ? 
  ( they should be scheduled right about now , no ? ), 
  [ this channel ] ( https://www.youtube.com/user/kudvenkat/videos ) is more useful than any of the subjects i had in college . 
  nah , finished last winter semester . 
  been looking for a job for these last few months now ... 
  i 'd be less : < if this was my first instance of not finding a job , quit college in early 20 's , spent a few years unemployed/on minimum wage , said `` fuck it '' and went to college again , and here i am . 
  does n't help that our education is so useless ( i 'm in it , yeah ... these colleges are like 20 years behind the times ) . 
  theoretically it 's my own bloody fault for not becoming an awesome programmer `` in my spare time '' . 
  but what 's then the point of education if 90 % is useless * but you have to pass it anyways * and you need to learn the other 80 % stuff `` in your spare time '' ? 
  argh . 
  and it 's too bloody hot . 
  and i need to paint my new room . 
  and i 'm nearing the end of my tobacco , but i ca n't be bothered to go buy more . 
  and i found my awesome tomcat dead yesterday !, 
  [ have n't listened to this for * years * ] ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qicwght5rpg ), 
  dat feel when you might be more like turkey than germoney ; - ;, 
  but seriously now - well some have , some do n't have . 
  some * could have * but they rather waste money on coastal vacations , because `` logic '' . 
  read the article . 
  the governments and other rich - read , influential - people will be the first hit with this . 
  because they 're the ones that can most afford trips to europe . 
  hehe it 's sooner pat & mat :p, 
  * ppp per capita . 
  hmm , just avoid raising 3 fingers up in the air , maybe even avoid saying `` ko nas bre zavadi '' , and you should be fine :p ps . 
  if you need any touristic help , there 's a megathread for that on r/croatia . 
  and when people say `` jebem ti mater '' , it does n't actually mean they 're fucking your mother . 
  ( i assume . ), 
  swears like that one are n't literal , they 're a way of showing displeasure . 
  and your karma at least is dying , which is good as far as i 'm concerned . 
  you could n't be civil and congratulate , you could n't even keep your mouth shut , no - you had to troll . 
  so , alright let 's say that telling you to die is too much . 
  `` go fuck yourself '' is appropriate , i think . 
  + [ first forest fires of this year . 
  ] ( http://www.croatiaweek.com/video-tourists-evacuated-as-new-blaze-starts-in-tucepi/ ) yes , i 'm saying `` first '' on purpose , more always follow in recent years ... we really need to do something about this global warming business . 
  nobody hurt and no houses burned thankfully , only the forest was harmed . 
  and some presumably annoyed tourists were evacuated , just in case . 
  + in an apparently unrelated fire , [ some random fiat burned down . 
  + [ kolinda went to vu\u010di\u0107 's inauguration in a very pink dress . 
  ] ( https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/6j7h41/the_borders_of_greater_serbia_vs_croatian_local/djcyi9u/ ) ) also bought him croatian chocolates , which might be a continuation of that moronic choco-scandal ... last year , there was a commemoration on defenders of dubrovnik day , kolinda accidentally gave serbian chocolates to the kindergarteners , * apologized for that * , everyone 's media had a field day with that amazing cringe , and now it appears that our politicians are bringing each other 's chocolates as gifts . 
  ( vu\u010di\u0107 followed with serbian ones to our pm shortly afterwards . 
  so this is the 3rd instance . ), 
  i do n't even know . 
  ok , good for them . 
  so did our regions , slavonia/dalmatia were separate kingdoms/duchies at times , ragusa did its own thing for centuries . 
  regions uniting is nothing new under the sun . 
  i still do n't see why i should feel a lot of kinship with random people from ex-yu . 
  or why i should buy into this narrative of `` we 're the same people '' . 
  go back far enough in history and all slavs were the same people . 
  same for most people groups today . 
  language ? 
  does that mean that the anglosphere are all actually brits in denial ? 
  keep in mind that all the former colonies have a history that 's shorter than even bosnia ( by centuries !, 
  ) , so why is it accepted that * they * are separate people/ethnicity , while us yugos are n't ? 
  besides , we tried to make yuga work for decades . 
  why should we keep trying ? 
  about that failed state , my opinion is that we may have loved and hated each other , but we never * respected * . 
  as can be seen on exhibit a : how the break-up went . 
  guys , maybe this is just me , but i suspect that op is karma-farming !, 
  more than a thousand years of separate history ?
