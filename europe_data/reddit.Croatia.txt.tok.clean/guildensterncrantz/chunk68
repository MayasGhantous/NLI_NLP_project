  yugoslavia lasted 73 . 
  and we fought each other , if you ignore the break-up and the world wars - when ? 
  we did n't really have much to do with each other before the 20th century , if you ignore bosnia ( they 're special that way ) . 
  unless you count the ottoman invasions as yugo invasions now ? 
  do you really think slovenians have more in common with macedonians than they do with austrians ? 
  so some - not all !, 
  - of us have the same-ish language . 
  and we have this failed mini-eu behind us . 
  but this closeness , yeah you 'd think `` we 're terribly similar '' because as you listen to the people speak about their daily lives it sounds so similar , but then you go on a subreddit like this one and notice the same similarities with people who are not ex-yugos . 
  for me it 's fellow slavs who were part of a-h first , but also poles and ukranians , the rest of balkan , and then for example - the irish . 
  you can find this samey-sameness in all sorts of places , that 's the plot twist of humanity , we have way more in common than what separates us . 
  speak for yourself , i do n't have a job !, 
  ok just checked the whole map , the only other oddity is czechia ... czech republic ... having just `` czech '' over it . 
  not sure if that 's an old thing . 
  my vote goes to `` vardar macedonia '' . 
  because [ `` od vardara do triglava '' ] ( https://pics.me.me/where-is-france-where-is-brazil-here-here-where-is-22285352.png ) . 
  this subreddit has some really sexy mods , has n't it ? 
  mm , i think similar applies to herzegovinians when it comes to nationalism . 
  also diaspora in general , which is another level of insufferable - easy to be a `` fine patriot '' when you do n't even live here and have little clue , also you 'd think that if they were very `` patriotic '' they * would n't have left in the first place * , aaand i 'm getting off-track now . 
  anyways . 
  yeah i / ( i * think * ) we know that support from serbia was hit-and-miss . 
  lots of desertions from jna , pretty low motivation afaik . 
  which imo ironically created yet another problem ... volunteers/paramilitaries were needed , and well - among such volunteers , you 'll have a greater odds of unfortunate character traits . 
  like aggression . 
  or maybe gullibility . 
  which means you get plenty of * bandits * like arkan and his lot . 
  anyhow , people here tend to look at the 90 's like an attempt at `` greater serbia '' , regardless of whether that 's correct or no ( or what the official statements by politicians were ) , because of the `` walk like a duck '' thing i explained . 
  nowadays it 's not taken very seriously , like some credible threat or something . 
  if for no other reason , then it 's cause if serbia has any nefarious goals , bosnia and kosovo are greater priorities . 
  as for the diplomacy and `` moving on '' , yeah ofc that 's welcome . 
  absolutely tiring , every time . 
  i believe we all heard about the fyrom naming dispute a thousand times by now . 
  yes , fyrom is being stupid there . 
  yes , we all know alexander was n't a slav . 
  remember how irritated just about everyone gets when western balkans start trolling each other on the internet , ranting about wars that happened decades or more ago ? 
  well , congratulations , you greeks managed to be even more insufferable . 
  source : i saw ex-yugos failing to rant against each other on the net , rare but it exists . 
  i have n't yet seen the same apply for greeks as soon as someone says `` macedonia '' . 
  every . 
  single . 
  time . 
  oi it was n't even one of us posting this time !, 
  ( and the attacked/vulnerable parts - from both serbia and ottomans earlier - well , they do tend to lean more right than left , which is a curious fact . ), 
  and as for why it 's a `` recent '' meme , well yeah there 's \u0160e\u0161elj being \u0160e\u0161elj , and yes most of the people here understand he 's like the equivalent of pernar or similar clowns . 
  but , the `` karlobag -- ogulin -- karlovac -- virovitica '' line was/is a thing among the extremists , but more importantly - [ this map . 
  ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/serbia_in_the_yugoslav_wars.png/1280px-serbia_in_the_yugoslav_wars.png ) plus the battlefields/affected areas / [ the plan ] ( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/jna_offensive_plan_1991.jpg ) ... they basically correspond to op 's map . 
  so the thinking goes `` if it walks like a duck ... '', 
  idk if you asked me i think it 's about bloody time burgenland croats rejoined motherland !, 
  ... which means [ slovenia 's head ] ( https://letsfeelslovenia.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/slovenia-totally-looks-like-a-running-chicken.jpg?w=640 ) is in the way . 
  hmm , what do ? 
  do n't be daft . 
  orban is a `` strong leader '' in the same way ivo sanader was . 
  remember him ? 
  very strong and fancy pm of ours , robbed us blind , is on trial for it . 
  in fact , the whole hdz robbed us blind , but that 's `` alright '' because they ramble about sovereignty a lot while they do that . 
  something i 've learned watching politicians ... when they wave the national flag with one hand , i check what the other hand is doing , odds are - it 's riffling through my pockets . 
  well for one , we do n't have our own money for it . 
  raising wages here in any significant level would need to be done by the richer eu ... not happening . 
  then there 's the pull factor for industry and such . 
  we 've been behind western/northern eu for a while now , and if let 's say microsoft established its branch in france in the 90 's , and france and croatia cost them equally , well then there 's no reason for them to consider moving - or even opening a new branch in croatia when they can open it in france for the same cost . 
  mind you this is just theoretical . 
  afaik romania and poland did well for themselves by pulling this industry , * we * certainly did n't . 
  i 'm all for getting a better wage , do n't get me wrong . 
  but what would happen more likely is that i would n't get a job - period - because i 'm `` not worth the cost '' . 
  ( though imo all these capitalists will mostly move to china & etc anyways , they always look to save money , so this measure to make all of eu more expensive is probably misguided . ), 
  oh , i agree that solution b is where it 's at , as i said iirc pretty much every border in the world was `` made '' by force . 
  you rule over whatever you can keep and/or wherever you can get the people to support your rule . 
  the people are presumably the same ethnicity or similar , but ethnicity is ... * pretty fluid * . 
  bunch of neighbors decide they 're `` one group '' . 
  but this whole thing with `` whatever you can keep or take '' , well that basically means war . 
  the thing with the last century or so , us earthlings are trying to at least keep the appearances of legitimacy and law . 
  so that 's why people point to history as an argument for legitimacy . 
  crimea is internationally problematic because if it got recognized , it gives precedent to europe/world going back to the `` good old days '' when neighbors took stuff from each by war - every other tuesday . 
  solution a : look at it statistically . 
  so according to that , for the vast , vast majority of history , for example dalmatian coast was n't bosnian . 
  it does n't go to bosnia . 
  solution b : `` a language is a dialect with an army '' . 
  applying it to borders and `` law '' , same dalmatian coast might have been ethnically croatian , but it was `` legally '' often under venice/italy , however they lost , ha ha ha suckers it 's ours !, 
  iirc solution b applies much more often to whatever country borders you can find ... everywhere in the world . 
  i 'm not a fan of kosovo leaving either . 
  that is , it 's complicated . 
  on one hand people should be able to choose to vote leave , democracy and all that . 
  on the other hand , where does that end ? 
  random parts of whichever state can just leave every time they 're displeased about something ? 
  that 's chaos . 
  then i end up leaning towards : if there 's lawful/historical precedent , then it 's less-bad . 
  like ex-yu republics with clear borders ( and separate history or whatever ... ) , or usa states , german bundesl\u00e4nder , uk with scotland etc. 
  iirc all kosovo had going for it was it being autonomous in yuga2 ... and in that sense , imo vojvodina has more precedent , cause they used to be part of a-h while the rest was under ottomans . 
  ethnic borders - c'mon , swedish malm\u00f6 could leave sweden under that logic . 
  but my general observation of bosnia ... 
  so it 's not working as it should . 
  people want to leave it because it 's not working . 
  but the same people are making sure that there 's little real statehood in that country in the first place , no ? 
  it 's - srpska says bosnia sucks , it 's split into pieces that are n't cooperating , but at the same time the people of srpska are making little to no effort to cooperate . 
  so imo the problem really is there , but it 's self-made . 
  ( and yes , i 'm aware that the other two sides are also to blame , everyone hates everyone there . ), 
  but is n't our name iranian ? 
  as in , it 's not just historians , linguists say that the name * is n't * slavic because ... 
  i do n't know , some language thing . 
  i 'm not a linguist .
